I have had the opportunity to playtest this game in wave 3 and have played in 6 times in less than 2 weeks!  This game is fabulous, and definitely one of a kind.  The end game condition is similar to Euphoria where it ends on stars, but having the vp multiplier based on territories, stars and resources takes it up a notch. Not only do you have to be worried about the last star going out, but you also have to keep track of your popularity.

There is so much good to be said about this game, I enjoy it the most with 3 players and we were typically able to finish a game in under 75 minutes.  There are not very many games that pack so much punch in such a short time. Highly recommended!

RATING: 6
Very fluid and attractive game but after a few plays I don't have a burning desire to play it again. Although you get to make a good number of decisions for the playtime, I don't find many of them particularly interesting. Your overall strategy is mostly determined by the action board you get because the 2/3 coin bonuses are impossible to ignore. That being said, the end-game timing and scrambling for area control is very good.

I have now played every faction. They all have a certain way to play each of them. That makes it fun to play with all the factions, you need to change your strategy for each of them. the ones that works for me are the Nordic and Rusviet factions.

RATING: 5
A 5 might be a bit harsh, usually I'd give this game for the experience that I had a 6.

This rating isn't because of a devastating loss, I actually won my first and only play of it. But it became pretty clear that this game has a runaway leader problem, which probably has to be balanced out by the other players having to unite against the leading player. That the game manual requests that people refrain from actually keeping count of who is ahead in points and how many points are to be gained by an action doesn't help, it seems like it just wants to mask this issue. In our case, it was a little race at the beginning, but the game was pretty much decided after three or four turns, and this in part to the initial setup and the very first random encounter. After half of the game, we could have stopped, the outcome was clear and there was no possibility at all that I could see for the other player to get back into the game, without having done anything wrong himself when playing the game. The unbalanced secret goal cards probably added to this: While one of mine was a breeze to accomplish, both of the other player were rather hard to fulfill.

The game is definitely playable, as in: the game mechanics are working together, but they don't complement each other well enough. When looking under the hood, leaving all that bling (the opulent visuals of the game) behind, the mechanics seem to be tackered together so that there is just some variation and choice for a change of the game state when playing. Despite it seeming very complex at start and when looking at it on the table, there is actually very little "game" to be found in this one.

In hindsight, the game hints at being deep and immersive, but actually there isn't much to it. The only good thing about this is, it's actually quite easy to teach. If you want a game that is designed a lot better with a gameplay similar to this one, then I'd recommend to get Eclipse or Terra Mystica, for example. Skip this one instead.

What Scythe does, it does extremely well. This is a euro-game that has been optimized to its logical conclusion -- and I like it. All of the fiddliness of something like [thing=177736][/thing] or even Terra Mystica has been stripped away, and you're left with a very appetizing core. 

I've enjoyed my plays so far, and would relish some additional time in this universe. Given time, Scythe could bump quite high up the list of my favorite euro-games, but I haven't played enough to draw that conclusion just yet.

Excellent game.  Really enjoy it.  I play it a bit more tactically than strategically after less than 10 plays, but expect to "graduate" soon as I learn the different capabilities of the factions and player boards.  Looks more daunting than it is.  Rules fairly simple to remember and implement.  Your choices are a delicate balance. To me, it lives up to the hype.

Excellent "4X" game, although the eXterminate is really missing from the game but that doesn't detract from the game in anyway. The euro game style economy and action resolution is perfect. Combat is quick and simple, but still contains a good level of strategy. Components are fantastic, especially the wonderfully sculpted mechs and characters. Art is spectacular and brings the whole thing together.

My second play had me looking forward to the next game. That is, I was thinking: "let this game end so that we can play something fun!"
It's balanced and works fine. Just severely lacking in the fun department.
It's like they took Ameritrash, and took out the part about emerging epic storytelling and dramatic and memorable events.
Then they took euros and took away the part about solving pressing problems in creative ways.
Not sure about what is left to like.

Plays very differently depending on the combination you get & maximizing your combo's potential is essential. I haven't played enough to know whether all combos are well-balanced. Fun, tense game that provides a variety of paths to victory. Beautiful design & components. Excellent streamlined engine-building gameplay. Things that keep it from being a ten: some fiddly rules that feel like they could have been streamlined, a little low on interaction for a game with combat, and finally: the encounter cards not coming with thematic intro text to describe the situation  and doing mostly the same thing. The encounter part could easily be fixed in a mini-expansion, and that alone would probably be enough to push it up to a 10.

Scythe is the most anticipated game of the year 2016. Fun fact: scythe is used for both farming and war. Personally for me Scythe is an alternative to Terra Mystica, both are great games.

Mechanism and Heaviness:
It's basically an action-selection game with resource management and engine building. Solid mechanic. Multiple paths to victory. Very similar to The Gallerist, each turn you choose 1 out of 4 sections with 2 actions available. You can do the top-row action, or bottom-row action, or both (top-row first), or neither. In summary: move, produce, bolster power/ popularity, build structures, deploy mechs, upgrade & enlist recruits. There's no rounds or phases. It's medium heavy. It's thinky. If you like thinky Euro games like Terra Mystica, you'll like this game. Straightforward and intuitive gameplay. The depth of the game relies on the strategies players apply during the game. Almost no downtime, the turns can go very fast between players as resources are limited. Clear iconography.

Theme
It's alternate-history Eastern Europa circa 1920s. Building your small empire on the map. The factions, the miniatures and encounter cards gives more thematic feeling. The encounters provide more options to get more resources, and if you spend more time to read the flavor text on the encounter cards, you get to immerse yourself into the worldbuilding, similar like Arkham Horror game. Can be retheme as Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings if you want.

Components and Setup
The components are superb and top notch, so many different shapes of tokens, different types of cards, the character and mech miniatures looks great on the board! The setup feels very much like Terra Mystica with starting resources (military, combat cards, objective cards, popularity, money) and units + buildings on personal player boards. Wooden token management on the mats like in Terra Mystica and Eclipse. There are several decks like combat, encounter, objective (just need to complete one per game) and factory cards (extra action space, gained when visited The Factory for the 1st time). 

Factions and Replayability
Well-balanced asymmetry faction and mech abilities like in Terra Mystica. 3 out of 4 mech abilities are to improve mechs' and character's movement, while the other 1 is to improve combat. Variability created by random pairings of faction mat and player mat for each player. Terra Mystica base game has 14 different factions, with Fire and Ice expansion has another 6 factions (10 different coloured boards), Scythe base game has 5 faction boards and 5 player boards, with 25 different combinations. With the Invaders from Afar expansion, there's gonna be 49 combinations! The replayability is high. Different faction, different starting available terrains, different strategies. You've got to adapt to your surrounding.

Actions
TOP: move/ gain money (by moving, there can be combat/ encounter/ factory), bolster military power/ gain combat cards, trade resources/ gain popularity or produce on tiles (different tile different resource, resources stay on board with worker: wood, oil, metal, food or worker); BOTTOM (pay with resources): upgrade (move cube from top row to bottom row for discount), deploy mechs (special faction abilities), build structures (mine/ monument/ armory/ mill) or enlist recruits (1-time bonus and unlock action-reaction). Dual benefits of the upgrade system - increase top-row action benefit and decrease bottom-row action cost. Some small reminders: mechs share abilities with character, not workers, which include riverwalk; mech and workers can transport resources; mill is an extra territory for production; enlist ongoing bonus include activation from active player and immediate neighbours.

Combat
Threat of combat is constant, but not mandatory. Deterministic combat systemu sing power dial and combat cards like in Dune/ Rex (also Game of Thrones, Forbidden Stars, Cosmic Encounters). Add numbers on power dial (up to military power to spend) and numbers on combat cards (2 - 5, depend on number of units on tile except worker). The combat resolved fast, unlike those other games. Sometimes a game can be without combat. Each faction need only to win 2 combats to put 2 achievement stars on triumph track except the Saxony. Combat will lower attacker's popularity if there is any retreating workers from the opposition faction. There are no units/ structures destroyed, only retreating to home base.

Endgame
Endgame condition triggers when 1 player put 6 stars on the triumph track after fulfilling various requirements. The stars will come out very fast towards the end of the game. Unique endgame condition, very similar to console gaming with the achievement stars on triumph track. Most money win - popularity (love) reminiscent to Euphoria's morale track affect how much money collected for each stars, territories controlled (The Factory counts as 3 territories) and resources controlled. Plus random structure bonus scoring tile. 
  
Solo Variant - Automa
There are 4 levels of difficulty, Autometta for easy, Automa for normal, Automaszyna for hard and Ultimaszyna for hardcore. The Automa cards make the solo variant plays very smoothly. Mostly the Automa units would aim to reach The Factory. The solo variant is as good as The Gallerist's. 

Final Thoughts
Scythe is a keeper. Fans of Terra Mystica, The Gallerist, Eclipse and Game of Thrones will be at home with this game, with extra ability to play solo. Reputable designer of Viticulture and Euphoria fame. Watch Rodney's Watch It Played video before playing the game really helps you understand how the game flows. 

Expansion
The expansion with extra 2 factions is a must, the board just scream for epic 7-players game! With the base game, it's War of the Five Kings, with the expansion, it's gonna be Battle of the Seven Kingdoms!

3 plays / 5,6,7 players

LIKE: So many powers to explore, and a lot of different setup combinations. Having the two board combo was interesting. Beautiful art and highly produced bits. The war tension was fun and not overly threatening (except at the end). Very similar to Antike.

DISLIKE: In higher player counts, I felt the mid-game stalled and I became bored. Some player powers feel better than others. The encounter cards were boring. The player boards are fiddly. The theme did not add anything for me. Turn-order feels off, because ending the game early denies other equal turns.

OVERALL: This game plays very similar to Antike, but Antike plays faster and feels streamlined. Scythe does have its fun moments, but it also had moments where my turn didn't feel that interesting, so it would drag a little. I'd rather play Terra Mystica, or Viticulture-- Scythe relies too much on its theme to elevate it above the hordes of modern games.

Played again, and my thoughts are the same. Not sure why people like the game so much, but maybe the game is better with 4 players.

RATING: 9
This game really lived up to the hype for me.  Sure the artwork is great and the theme integration is well done, but it is the gameplay that stood out.  It's definitely more of an efficiency Euro than a dudes on a map game, but I like having the option of attacking if necessary.  After three plays, I'm hoping to try out all of the other factions.

I have some concerns about replayability because there isn't much emergent gameplay here, but it's still a lot of fun.

Update : After five plays this is still a 9.  I still really enjoy it and there is still more to explore.  I haven't tried the black or green factions, and I have no idea how to win with the blue Nordics.

6th play with the green faction was fun!  Just need to try the black faction now.

7th play with the black faction.  Still really enjoy this game and I think there is more to explore.  Looking forward to more plays.

Absolutely gorgeous art and great (over)production. I especially have to admire the art because it looks as elegant, lively and inspiring as fantasy themed art can. This alternative history thing really rouses your imagination. It is a shame that the graphic design doesn't quite fulfill the same standards since the symbols can be a bit hard to read and most of the essential information easily escapes the eye on a quick glance.

Playing is quite fun but, surprisingly, falls into the category of euro games. Looking at the game and reading the fluff makes you kind of expect more rumble and action. But no. You're collecting resources instead and turning them into victory points. 

The game starts extremely slow and you feel like making no progress at all. After a while it picks up pace and players start to advance on multiple fronts in parallel. This results in a quick game end. Or maybe quick is a wrong term here because you can see it coming from a distance already, but you just reach each goal on consecutive turns, which creates a sensation of suddenness. 

The biggest achievement of the game is The art, but as a game I would call it ok at best. Nothing wrong with it, but instead of euro style grinding a proper mech clash would've been more interesting.

There is a lot to teach with this game and for my group, its unfortunate that the first few rounds are basically just figuring out how everything works.

I got to playtest this game as part of the massive blind playtest. I saw it evolve through several iterations, all the way to its [nearly] final state. I love: the artwork, the asymmetrical player mats, the "upgrade" part of the engine-building, the realistics resources, the metal coins, the Euro-style problem-solving coupled with the threat of Ameritrash territory fight. The actual combat system isn't my favorite, but even after playing more than a dozen games, I can't think of a better way to incorporate head-to-head conflict over territory into a eurogame, so I guess it's actually as good as can be expected.
The number of player mat - faction mat combinations make replay possibilities very large, as does the game's flexibility with number of players. I've played with every possible player number and they're all good (another thing that increases the replayability is that the game plays differently with different player counts).

Scythe feels a lot like Eclipse to me, for some reason, despite the two sharing very little in the way of mechanics. Every time I play, I get the itch to pull out my second-favorite space epic. (This is not a bad thing.)

As with most Stonemaier Games, Scythe's art and components are absolutely gorgeous. The game itself is both well-balanced and fast-paced, with some interesting strategies and different ways to build an engine. My only complaint is that combat isn't quite as common as I'd like, but the threat of it is palpable and gives the game an interesting "WWI stalemate" feel. The Automa solo mode is solid—definitely a big plus for me.

While it was initially a 7, it got quite boring. The board and faction pretty much dictates what you need to do in regards to engine building. This results in actually very few real choices and most of them are opportunities for an attack you might want to take or not. The material is nice but it only distracts from the real problem, that you may actually have to make 1-2 real choices in the whole game.

RATING: 10
I absolutely love this game!  It strikes an excellent balance between planning (strategy) and response (tactics).

I like how the combat/pvp nature of the game is well balanced - there is such a dual-edged nature to combat that players think long and hard before committing to them and it can be strategically advantageous to eat a loss rather than over commit and obtain a victory.  In addition (and this is for games of 3+ players), you have to consider how winning 1 combat weakens your overall ability to defend yourself and opens you up to combat from other players.  It really is well done.

I also like the engine building.  It's not a complicated engine, but the operations required to establish the engine and utilize it are varied enough that players have many choices to make.  In addition, those choices tend to be very deep - they are the tip of the iceberg, a snowball that may or may not lead to the ultimate goal (global world domination or something like that).  It's the depth of gameplay that keeps me coming back.

I like the dual nature of upgrades.  You uncover a benefit and cover a cost.  It's such a nice way of offering compelling, meaningful choices with real consequences.

The variance in starting position/mats is fantastic!  The combination of faction + player mat makes for some real differences in terms of the best strategy to utilize.  And then you have to consider the goals, which may or may not be worth pursuing.  Plenty of choices!

I love the art in this game.  Pastoral and very thematic.  The illustrations help frame the game in a larger context.  It wasn't strictly necessary, and not everyone likes or enjoys it, but I think it adds character to the bigger package and presentation.

Production value is excellent!  Even the base game is high quality.  The additional pieces (metal coins, board extension, realistic resource tokens) are much appreciated!

I strongly recommend using glass markers/beads in place of the cardboard exploration tokens.  The cardboard tokens get lost among the board's colorful artwork.  3d beads are *MUCH* easier to see and improve gameplay.

My primary criticism is that games will often end with an unequal number of turns.  This is something that [u][url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23299059#23299059]I discussed in the forums[/url][/u].  I have two "answers" for this point.  My first inclination, as suggested by sethvanorden in that thread, is to use turn order as a handy cap modifier.  Very easy and very understandable.  My second thought is to give a small compensation to those players who received one less turn - an award on the order of 5 coins or so.  Small, insufficient, but enough to reduce the sting and say "I feel your pain but I'm not giving you 100% insurance coverage."  I think either or both of those will help.

Overall, this is just a fantastic game.  I think there's enough depth to keep me interested for a long time without overwhelming players.  Also, the play time hits a sweet, [i]sweet[/i] spot - 2 hours once people are familiar.  There are potential swings and not everything is 100% balanced, but it shouldn't be.  This is not a pure abstract - it's a thematic euro.  You want it unbalanced enough to provide options, but not so off-kilter that the whole system wobbles out of control.  And it hits that spot beautifully.

Try it.  [gameid=169786] may or may not be your cup o' tea, but I'd give it better than even odds that you see and appreciate at least some of its carefully crafted beauty.

Don't understand all the hype. It's a mix of area control and resource menagement engine building but none of the parts are really. While mechanics of developing your faction are neat they seem repetetive and there is not much replayability here. Area control part feels like added because of mech-stimpunk theme. While the theme is great, area control combat is weak with its very simplistic aproach. The rule that is really out of place here and unthematic when thinking about fighting mechs is that you never destroy any units. They just teleport to their home base.
One thing that is really good in this game: components. With small note about the board which is dark and a little illegible.

1st play: Thematically this game is awesome.  Post-war mechs being repurposed as farm support, limited but purposeful combat and an amazing production with metal coins, giant board and plastic mechs.  In terms of mechanics I'm not so sure.  It felt like there was more downtime than there should have been, and very little interaction between players.  The optimization game of trying to double up actions made for some thinky bits and when you pull off a combo it's satisfying.  As always, I hate when games could easily have equal turns but choose not to.

2nd play: After said and done, an average game.  The mechanics feel a little more clunky than they need to (with dual actions each move but each player having different combos of dual actions it's hard to keep track of each other player's playerboard.  Knowing which factions can go to which terrain types and which factions combo trading with mechs vs trading with enlist.  The result is a pretty multi-player solitaire game.  The theme is great though.

Great components and art. The mechanics of this game streamline a lot of other mechanics and ideas from other games and the result is a clever and beautiful game.

This is the game we play the most! It's truly a beautiful game, very easy to start playing. I've taught plenty of new people to play it and it never takes more than a few turns for them to get the basic hang of it thanks to the great interface. The artwork is top notch and the game mechanics are flawless. Maybe if there's anything I would change, it would be the combat, since it's easy to win combats as long as you have high power and a 5 combat card as long as you're the attacker. But this isn't really the focus of the game. This game is definitely a 10/10!

To me Scythe feels like an evolution from Eclipse. Same hexagonal play area (but not modular), same central galactic core (factory), asymmetric powers, space ships (mechas).

Scythe lacks an exploration phase, and the opportunity for players to build their galaxy by choosing how to place system tiles.

Also, there is no mecha customization, whereas spaceship design is a strong suit of Eclipse.

In Scythe combat is much more streamlined, which is really a plus, but it's much less epic than with Eclipse.

Scythe offers more modularity in the asymmetric powers by randomly combining two player faction boards, whereas Eclipse has fixed boards (but more of them with the expansions).

Artwork in Scythe completely crushes Eclipse. Scythe art is beautiful and distinct, Eclipse artwork is generic and uninspired.

Eclipse plays nine turns, Scythe endgame is activated by achieving 6 "goals", which is a mechanic I disliked.

I had the feeling that Scythe played faster than Eclipse.

Scythe has a popularity mechanic, whereas Eclipse only has a puny "traitor" negative tile.

Scythe has a seemingly great solo module, but as I don't own neither Eclipse, nor Scythe, that is irrelevant to me.

Given the choice, I'll play Eclipse any time over Scythe. The tension, epic scale, diversity of strategies are much grander in Eclipse than Scythe.

Please, design Eclipse with better artwork, and fix the combat mechanic.

Worker placement light, combat 'dune' type light, wargame bloodless light as you don't even need to rebuild. Theme is great but not important. Miniatures are pretty nice but not exactly necessary. General overall production is of great value.

The removing cubes to gain more and cost less for second action is not new, but works fine here. I can understand why there are only six stars needed to end the game, as most resources within the player playmat would have been exhausted. Small feel of Agricola meets Dune. 

The end game boils down to coins, with area control and resources being measured for success. No victory objective. Just senseless battles for an area that may not even be connected to your empire. 

Cards add a more variety to victory and makes the game already chaotic as it is. Kemet feel to it, but thematically weaker.

A solid game that I think will continue to improve for us.

Our first play through was at 2 players. Being our 'learning game', it was a bit slow and quiet. We had two combats, one victory for each of us. We felt lukewarm about it, but hopeful.

Our second play through was at 4 players which was a definite step up in fun. Multiple combats, everyone employed different strategies, resulting in completely different stars placed across the board - unintentionally, at that! We all attempted to play to our specific asymmetric strengths, which was awesome. I also noticed a step up in strategy having a game under my belt, so I can see the opportunity and desire to refine my plan next time around.

I look forward to more plays. This went from a low 7 to a solid 8 by my second play. Early to say where it will land in the long run.

I'm interested in the expansions, but only if the game has legs on its own for a while more.

I dunno... this just never hits the table so it may be on it's way out.

Another fantastic game from Jamey Stegmaier! Not quite as good as his wonderful Euphoria, but pretty close! And although it has Euphoria-like elements, it strangely reminds me of a cross-breeding of Polis and Age of Empires! Indeed, it reminds me of a lot of games; and that's the only problem I have with Scythe:

I love games which incorporate tried-and-true mechanics, but have an added twist to them which breathes new life into the old mechanic. I can't really find such a twist in Scythe. However, since all the mechanics work impeccably well (and one's turns are super fast), that doesn't make Scythe a bad game by any stretch of the imagination; but it does prevent me from giving it a straight 9.

I really don't see what the hype is about. I wanted very much to dive into this, but there's not much there.  The artwork is great, but the game is another boring euro. Player interaction is there, but way below expectations. Combat is fun, but you only do it a few times per game. The poster boards are unique and helpful. If you like pushing cubes, this might help you expand your taste beyond pure euro.  For me, there's too much point salad and too much hype. This is a fun game, but it won't meet your expectations
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game has no arc. It has an anti-climactic and abrupt ending. There is a serious runaway leader problem. I can usually tell who is likely to win halfway through, and there is rarely anything anyone can do about it. This is largely because the methods of interaction in this game are so extraordinarily unsatisfying.

You can "attack" people, but only occasionally and situationally will you really hurt them. Combat feels empty and flat. There are rarely serious consequences to losing a combat. In fact, good combat decisions are virtually always pre-scripted if players are playing competently. It's an incredibly important and yet lifeless aspect of the game.

I'm not saying scythe is all bad. It has a unique character and some interesting euro decisions. But I believe that scythe is also about an inch deep and a mile wide. It looks and feels epic. But the weight of decisions are somewhat flimsy and largely about being slightly more efficient than the other guys and gals. The asymmetrical player boards are all different flavors of the same thing. Practically the only difference from game to game is if your faction synergizes especially well with your player board or not.

The game pieces (at least the plastic ones) look very good even unpainted. It’s a shame the gameplay doesn’t match the promise of the components. At heart this is a typical uninspiring euro with very little combat. I don’t like the generic map (why is not historical if this is supposed to be an alt-history game?). The great artwork of the box is not carried over to the cards (which add nothing to the theme). The thing that annoys me most is the aesthetic clash of the plastic and wooden pieces on the board - I don’t need the material as a reminder of what is or isn’t a combat unit when there are only two plastic units in the game! Plastic buildings and workers would have looked so much better and leave the wooden pieces on the player board. My challenge is to make a game I’d really like to play using all these great components!

An interesting game with some lovely mechanics, beautiful artwork, and game play that is neither too complicated nor too simple. Though it is not without its flaws.

You control a faction that has to farm resources and build mechs and buildings in order to gain victory stars. Play ends when the first person gains thier 'n'th vistory star. All players then recieve money for each building, mech, farmer and territory that they control, the amount you gain is dependant upon your poplarity. The winner is the person with the most coin at the end.

Once you understand the mechanics of the game it runs very smooth and each persons turn is very quick, the only 2 downsides I can pick with this game is that there is too little written on the encounter cards. I can see how they are trying to let the artwork tell the story but it only really works for the person that takes the card.
The other downside is that I don't feel like the spending of resources is properly managed. There are 4 upgrades that you can spend resources on and 4 resources to spend. Each upgrade costs an amount of 1 specific resource, meaning that certain resources quickly become redundant. It is a small gripe but it doesn't feel right. Why doesn't a mech cost 'X' metal + 'y' oil? Why is it just metal? Why does a building only cost wood? Why not wood and metal and food?

Despite these 2 gripes it is an engaging game that is beautifully made with a lot of love. Overall it's a great game that will hit the table in the future.

I have only owned Scythe for a couple weeks now but have somehow managed to convince people to play it with me roughly 8 times already. I have played with 1-4 players so far, played with each character and action card at lead once, and have taught the game several times now.
Here's what you need to know:
There is little to no "chance" in this game. Other than the randomization in setting up the game (which is optional), the only luck is in some of the card draws (combat cards, encounter cards, factory cards) and even those will certainly not determine your fate. Ultimately this game comes down to strategy and a better player with a better strategy wins.
The solo mode is awesome. It works extremely well and, once learned, can be fast paced, challenging, and novel each time it is played. The autonoma is not crazy and unpredictable, but rather follows a general strategy consisting of building up, then crossing the rivers, then moving in the direction of the factory and you, and then getting aggressive real fast. While it may seem as though having a general pattern like this would cause repetitive gameplay, it doesn't; it simply makes the autonoma more like a smart strategic player who does what he needs to do to win and keeps the pressure on you to play well or play dead.
Explaining the game is surprisingly easy, though admittedly an involved process. All of the gameplay in Scythe thematic, meaning that nothing in the game exists just to make the game function, it all legitimately fits with the theme well. This results in much of the mechanics being very intuitive and memorable because it makes sense that it would be that way in real life.
Though the game is intensely strategic, I have found that non-game-geeks can actually really enjoy it. Several people I have played with have finished the game with a comment like "I usually can't sit down and play a game like this for more than 20 minutes without getting bored out of my mind, but this was actually really fun!" 
It doesn't have to take 2 hours. In fact, only one of my playthroughs thus far has exceeded and hour and a half (not including explanation) and that was a 4 player game with 2 new players and everyone was a game geek. Most of my playthroughs have taken around an hour, and probably could have been shorter if people knew the game well. You can really decide the speed of the game by how aggressively you play; if you just push to get stars as quickly as possible, it is conceivable that the game would end in 45 mins.
Overall, the game has been nothing but a good time so far and a great challenge. I look forward to many more plays and I will very likely buy the expansions before too long.

I deliberately did not pay attention to the hype over 2014-2016 and got to play this fresh. It compliments Eclipse so well as being a Eurotrash 4X game (perhaps my favorite niche-within-a-niche?), but leaning more towards the efficiency/Euro end of the spectrum, while Eclipse is leaning more towards the Civilization Game/Ameritrash end of the "middle."

Due to hype my expectations for the game were high. The game has outstanding production quality, but otherwise it didn’t feel any special. Scythe tries to be robust by having the same kind of controlling mechanisms as used for example in Terra Mystica. In the game you keep forgetting to use your benefits, since they are not given in clear phases as in TM. Scythe tries to be thematic in its fantasy world, but the theme is basically integrated to the plastic components of the game. Also, you expect Scythe to be conflict oriented game. However, the number of combats is limited since after the second successful battle there is really no point of attacking anyone.

A well designed, 4X civilization builder that reminds me of both Eclipse and Clash of Cultures, which are both very worthy designs.  Of the three, I might actually prefer Scythe which is saying something, in part, because I like the variable starting conditions and the way victory points are distributed at the end using popularity, objectives (stars), hexes controlled, and resources controlled.   

The art is dystopic, appropriate to its theme, and the components in the collectors edition are top notch.  Combat seems to be dialed at about the right level.  Our five player game played surprisingly well for that player count.

Like Concordia, I can see why this game is so popular.  The mechanics and theme are very well thought out and integrated.  Also like Concordia, I didn't particularly enjoy the experience.  In this case, I was so stressed out playing it to really enjoy it myself.  I was really turned off by watching "enemy" mechs stare down all my workers, threatening to run them off, etc.  For some reason, I just couldn't detach myself from the theme to really enjoy it.

One of the best games I have played. I love that there are so many ways to try and win. Game plays long. Two and half hours for the games I have played. Make sure all the players can stay for the duration. It sort of spoils it when some need to leave early. I love it and want to play more.

So far I've enjoyed every playthrough of Scythe. Yes, gameplay is solitaire at the first half of the game. Yes, certain faction - player mat combinations can be easier to figure out than others. Yes, combat is not a tiny bit exciting. However, these facts are not flaws. These just make Scythe what it is. A very well thought out, solid design. A fun game with very high component quality even compared against contenders at the same price point.

I still have to play a lot more to explore Scythe as I haven't even tried Polania yet. Let's see if it'll live up after a few more plays.

RATING: 9
Great action selection game with some gorgeous artwork. The rules are deceptively simple. While it's a resource management game at its core, there's a nice little twist with the resources are stored on the board itself which can be stolen by opponents if they get desperate or if you let too much of a good thing accumulate in one spot. While it looks like this might be a combat-heavy game, it takes a back seat to the rest of the gameplay.

Incredible game boards, variable powers, theme and much more. I like that it doesn't require a lot of combat and that combat is costly but losing battles is not that bad. This prevents ganging up and taking out players. Miniatures are incredible. Overall though, it is still just a economic game built on an expensive platform.

[ESP] Wow, qué decir. Comencemos porque no le tenía tanta fé. Mi esposo insistió en comprar la copia deluxe y yo le seguí la corriente, pero eso de los enfrentamientos me mataban la idea. Lo jugamos esta semana y debo decir que me encantó. Tiene muchas cosas que me gustan en los juegos: Varias opciones de acciones, administración de recursos, creación de maquinas, etc... y menos mal que los enfrentamientos son mínimos. Lo recomiendo completamente, sobretodo si tienen la versión de lujo que es preciosa.

Rating after one 2-player game:

Wow, I'm astonished at how little I liked this game. Although it doesn't take that long, I was very bored and fed up with it after the first half, already. The game is a quite dry euro - something I usually don't mind at all - fiendishly disguised as a gunblazing ameritrash game. I was aware of this fact beforehand but could not get over this disconnect, nevertheless.
Nothing in this game excited me. Most actions fall into the categorie "pay some, get a bit more of something else", or move (with the potential threat of combat). Combat also does not spark any tension in this game. Worst case and your workers and mechs get pushed back.

Apparently this game hits all the sweet spots for our family. We have played it non-stop since the school year ended. 8 games in 4 days--one of them with 7 players, mostly first-timers! Insane, but so fun. There is such a satisfying combination of decisions and variables to take in every game. Some of its charm is intangible, since there is nothing terribly innovative about the mechanics themselves, but Jamey has hit a home run with this one! Can't wait to play again.

Had the pleasure of being taught this one by the designer himself. Hard to track triggers for bonuses based on actions others take, as well as generally knowing what people are doing and what their capabilities are unless they fully "narrate" their turns. Instinct is that 3P would be the perfect count if the map were shrunk for it, but it also looks like that would require a house rule. Combat was rare with our group, and we had a semi-broken "re-use a factory card" combo in play. I'm nit-picking a bit because these are the only parts that really stand out to me, the info and the sizing. On the whole, a very solid game that I'd gladly replay. And on a second, I took a step back in performance and immediately wished for a redo because now I may finally get it. It's growing on me.

Best kickstarter experience ever.  Received this weekend - earlier than expected.  The production is amazing.  The quality of the components, the gorgeous artwork, the beautiful board.  

Game play was great - a neat combination of euro mechanics with tactical board positioning, resource management and (at least the ever present threat of) combat.  The tension between players stands out on multiple fronts: the tactical game play, the race for the factory, and the race for six stars.  I love the asymmetry and you think twice about engaging in combat - especially with workers present on the other side.  

I think this game will stand the test of time in our household.  Love it!

This game suffers, to a lesser extent, the same issue as Euphoria. The choices aren't extremely meaningful until the very end. You're sort of corralled into good decisions. The lack of meaningful decisions stems from each action having a secondary action that you can do if you have the resources,.As attacking is so infrequent, it is not as much a part of the game as I had thought it would be.  I can't sing enough praises for Stonemaier games visual design,

RATING: 8
There are several aspects of this game that I think are noteworthy.  One of the most obvious is the artwork (absolutely stellar) and the production quality (well above average).  As for game play, it is notable for the fact that for a "big" game, downtime is not too bad, nor are turns too quick in passing.  Play time and turn time really hit the mark quite well.  The variable setup in player factions with a fixed board layout is quite good and a nice twist from the normal variable board and fixed players.  It is not entirely clear if everything is fully balanced when you consider the faction combinations and encounter benefits.  So some swings in the game can and will happen.  For a game with more mental input, it could be a deal breaker, but Scythe somehow manages to feel both big box and light at the same time.  It's a solid game and it will be interesting to see how it holds up over time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game. The only reason I am not giving this game a 9 is because Russia is seriously way overpowered, but more on that in a second. I love the depth that Scythe brings to our shelf. Players choose a country of origin to play as, and each country has a unique player mat with an anchor ability that serves as your best-bet strategy. Basically, every country is going to play the game a bit differently. On your turn, you can choose to do one action set. A set is broken down into a basic action (top) and an upgraded action (bottom). The actions are the same for every player, but the actual paired set of actions may be different for each player. If you choose to take both actions in a set, you must do your top action first; however, both actions are optional. Sounds too good to be true? It is. Whatever action set you chose to do on your current turn, will be unavailable to you on your next turn...unless you are freaking Russia! I'm a little peeved about how ridiculous that ability is. Other than that, I love Scythe. Well worth the investment.

I spent over two weeks of my life in a warehouse boxing hundreds of copies of this game to mail out to all the Kickstarter backers (you're welcome) so I figured I'd need to get myself a copy.  Here goes. 

A little difficult to learn, especially if you're new to complex Euro games like me, but once you get going, it's a blast. Lots of strategic thinking and management of resources, which changes each game as you are randomly assigned your player mat. Also a very exciting end-game scoring mechanic.  However, it felt a little light on player interaction. 
On my first play through I was disappointed by the costly and not-incredibly useful combat mechanic, but eventually I learned the necessary strategies to make it an effective tool (lots of little attacks/feints, and a liberal use of combat cards. Also, Polania's submerge ability. Fight guerilla style, not all-out war). 
That being said, don't expect combat to ever take the center stage, no matter how good you are at it- it's a tool you occasionally use rather than the basis of the game.  If you want a wargame, this isn't it. 

All in all, a game that starts slow and gets better and faster as it goes, both within each game itself and across multiple playthroughs.

1/14/18: Played the kickstarter edition with the nice pieces and the larger board.  The bits and the artwork are very nice.  Nice but nothing exceptional.  To me it was clearly inferior to something like Terra Mystica or Eclipse.  Maybe I'm just being a grump because a lot of newer games that I've played recently for the first time of this genre have felt like nothing special.  Once you build everything from one resource, there is absolutely no reason to get any more of it.  To me it seemed that the decisions were going to become relatively simple after a few game plays, and I'm sure that with more plays there will be more direct conflict.  With 5 players the winning score was around 40 (second place was around 20), and the materials indicate that it should be around 70, so maybe we're missing a big part of the game.  

Some good points:  All the kickstarter materials are available from the publisher's website, so if you missed out you are not forever screwed.  I like that people are hesitant to engage in combat, and sometimes you may decide not to put a lot of energy into a fight.  It  plays well with 5 and 7, and kept everyone engaged.

Games that I'd rather be playing than this: Eclipse, Agricola.

Expanded thoughts after some solo play and three live games: Beautifully made and mechanically interesting euro hybrid. Shares DNA with Terra Mystica and Rex, and belongs in the same family as Hyperborea and Romolo O Remo. Changes dramatically depending on player count - 2p is quite tense and confrontational, despite the board space. 3p becomes more tentative and economic. 5p is a little long, but brawly and a bit more chaotic. It's interesting at all these counts.

As a rule I don't like war games. Usually conflict is resolved by random chance and rarely has something to do with who has managed his ressources the best. Scythe mends that problem for me. 

In what can only be described as a three and a half X rather than a 4X game Scythe manages to make the best euro war game yet. You have to prioritise the right ressources and the right actions to make your strategy count. 

I feel the best way to describe the game is to break it apart in each of the four Xs.

Explore - Your character is going on an adventure, whether he's focusing on a lot of encounters, making it to the factory first or just partaking in combat, he is going to have a fun time. The encounter cards is so beautiful that I would love a poster of each just to hang it on my wall. 

Expand - The fact that you can only move two units one tile at the start of the game makes the expansion part very very slow... and it is brilliant.  Your decision to go to the forest instead of the mountains could be costly or could it?

Exploit - This is one of the best parts of the game because it ties so beautifully together with the other 3 Xs. You choose where to produce resources, but instead of just taking them to your own resource pile you keep them on the board. 

Exterminate - This is the half X. You cannot exterminate your opponent, but you can cripple them. With the slow moving units being knocked back to base is a huge set back and so costly that people will rarely engage in combat where they only "might" win. It has to be dead certain. If someone is producing a lot of resources near your units you can start threatening to take them off him quite quickly. This can escalate quickly into a cold war instead of an actual war. Which is what war usually is, a lot of posturing but the results of actual combat is so expensive that you'll try not to engage unless it's absolutely necessary or you are guaranteed a win.

Scythe is a unique American/Euro hybrid that leans more towards the euro-side of thing. For instance, players can attack each other but are strongly discouraged from doing so (If you displace workers, you lose popularity, which reduces your VP). But the heart of the game, which I also find quite intriguing, is the action-selection boards. See, each player has a unique board and a unique starting location. Trying to understand how to string various actions together with the abstract elements on the game board is what make the game feel so puzzley. Combined that with a strong race element, you have a puzzle that feels very tense to play.

So what not to love? For one, the blind-bidding and certain abilities (randomly draw combat card from a opponent's hand) adds silly luck to a rather thoughtful game. But perhaps more influential, certain nation/action-board combinations seem to be easier to play or have more viable strategies. That being said, combat in the game didn't bother me as much as I anticipated. For one, combat is deemphasized but still important as it can earn players starts and can screw with the engine of another player. And because of the strong race-element in the game, having to modify one's plans... because your opponent took a hex with a needed resource... can be a huge annoyance/hindrance. Thus combat cleverly becomes more about posturing than actually attacking other players, which I like. 

Don't get me wrong, Scythe is a well-designed game. For instance, the action-selection boards can be upgraded so that they get bonuses for specific actions that players take... thus encouraging players to focus on what other players are doing, which makes the race element even more palpable. But I'm a gamer with fairly narrow preferences and Scythe manages to be a mix bag of things I love (puzzles) and things I dislike (blind bidding, luck, etc). It's such a rich/unique game that I will still play it... but it's not one that I'm going to proselytize.

I think this is the first time I've given a game 10 star. The artwork was well designed, and the game play is the best that I've seen for an economic style game with war elements. And besides the combat cards and the player's individual starting missions, there is no chance in this game at all. It's all about who has the best strategy and the most cooperative allies (or being a back stabbing ally).

Just got the art connoisseur's edition in last week and had my first official play this weekend at our game group.  Two had play tested with me before and had 1 new player.  The game was awesome.  

Everyone loved the components and raved about how much appealing they made the look and feel of the game.  The coins and resources were a particular hit.  Others at the game day kept coming over to pick up the pieces and feel them.  The mini's were also well liked.

As far as the gameplay, the original playthrou9ghs I had were during the play testing phases.  The game really has only gotten better through the process and was immediately one that the group was saying to bring real army for play.  The balance, variable ways to win and uniqueness of the game prompted many unsolicited comments of how praise for the game when we finished.    One of the comments was how rich of a game could be played in a relatively short time.  

Great game and beautiful components.

Végre sikerült Kaszáznom nekem is:) Ez tényleg rohadt jó basszus! Azt eddig is láttam, hogy pofátlanul jól néz ki, de a játékmenet is bejött. Mielőtt elfelejtem: a játékostábla kicsit Terra Mystica (sőt Hansa T.) utánérzés volt. És maradjunk ennél az elemnél: az már eleve nagyon jó indítás, ahogy a setupot megoldották, a bemélyített helyekkel. Az meg a másik, hogy nagyon szuper hogy a piros és a zöld ennyire egyértelműen jelzi hogy mit fizetek, mit kapok, sok játéknál ezt cseszik el. Csak 2 népet láttam eddig, de nagyon tetszik, amit az egyes népekből kihoztak, még a térképes elhelyezésükben is elég nagy a szórás (pl. japánoknál nincs akadály a térkép túlfelére), remélem sikerült kb. egálra tesztelni őket. Az alapkoncepció is nagyon rendben van. A 10-ből 6-ot kell (vagy nem is feltétlen kell a győzelemhez ugye) teljesíteni, sőt pl. a németeknél lehet mind a 6 ugyanaz, ezért tuti sokutas a dolog. A mi játékunkban (ami próbajátéknak is felfogható) is teljesen más irányban tapogatóztunk, mégis 1 lépésen múlt a győzelem. Hiába fejleszt ki valaki mindent az egyéni tábláján, egy vesztes csatán lehet mindent figyelembe véve ~ 20 pontot is bukni, meg bekavarhat sok fajspecifikus dolog is. A csata egyszerű de tök jó, egyedül az volt fura, hogy a döntetlennél a győztes nyer:) Tetszik a középső mező kiemelt szerepe, 5 játékosnál ez tuti sok izgalmat és konfliktust generál. Nem is tudok belekötni, azért adtam elsőre "csak" 8-ast, hogy legyen hova javítgatni még (meg azért, mert nem igazán szoktam 9-10-et adni 1 parti alapján). Legközelebb szólóban is ki szeretném próbálni. A legújabb generációs játékok egyik mintapéldánya: nagy hype, gyönyörű külső, mindent tud amit az elődök, de azért van néhány elegáns kis apró újítás is benne, és tök jó élményt ad. Nem véletlen adják ki magyarul, aminek örülök. 
És a sok pozitívum után egy kis negatívum: a bazi sok kieg:)) Én kiegfüggő vagyok, talán ezért is érint érzékenyen, hogy egy vagyon lesz, ha ezt mind be akarom szerezni. Ami alapból nem szokott zavarni, de itt már az alap játéktáblán lévő 7 fajból is 2-t kiegként vehetünk csak meg. Ritka, hogy már egyből vagy 10 kieggel jön ki egy játék (bár a bgg-n ezeknek a fele csak kellékeknél van fent). Új fajok, szebb pénz, plusz kártya, szebb nyersanyag, stb. Persze őket is meg lehet érteni, elég jó a játék ahhoz, hogy sok bőrt le lehessen húzni rólunk:) A játéktábla növelés is mindenképp ajánlott kellék egyébként.

Played once, initial rating. This seemed (to me) to be a point-salad game trying to disguise itself as .... well, anything else, I suppose. I had ideas, but i was mainly bored. If the game had taken 2/3rds the time that would have helped immensely.

About 30 solo plays so far. Enough variability for many more if I didn't have so many other games. To me the solo game surpasses Mage Knight and Robinson Crusoe, and possibly even Agricola, though YMMV. Morten's Automa is great. Follows the faction abilities well. Takes a while to learn how to win consistently even using the mildest version.

2 player, the mechanics were great, but it felt like we were playing separate games since there was so little interaction. Which is not particularly up my alley

3 player, it felt like we were playing pretty much the same game as opposed to 2 players. some light skirmishes and territory disputes happened making the advancement of the engine a bit more enjoyable

RATING: 10
One of the best. This one always makes it to the table, and the whole family loves it. Scythe is very well balanced, and just asymmetrical enough to make each play engaging and interesting. 

We have found ourselves saying that this faction or that one is overpowered, but with continued playthroughs we are finding that new strategies appear, making more and more options viable. 

The engine building is amazing, and you really have to stay on your toes. You can make a mistake here and there and still do alright, but you can get de-railed quickly if you aren't thinking ahead.

If you don't have this game, get it. And then get the Invaders from Afar expansion.

Played it at Essen 2016. The game has amazing, beautiful art, gameplay..at least the early gameplay is very streamlined for the expected difficulty and the encounter cards ar so much fun. these things along with the different factions really draw you in the game and you get to feel the atmosphere. Question remains open if combat is up to par and if the game doesnt become to monotone once the best strategy for each faction becomes evident. Depending on that I would increase or decrease the rating for half a star. Overall a great game and only the high price prevented me from buying it.

This is a very nice production, and the game features some nice mechanics, including the restraint on aggresiveness (which calls for smarter military tactics) also seen in games like Eclipse. It also has a unique development system which is not easy to master, something also seen in Terra Mystica. However, I was not ecstatic with the overall gameplay synthesis of these mechanics. Particularly, I dislike the fact that I have to scan the map regularly, either to iterate my resources or to foresee enemy player advancements. I also did not find the game that innovative as a whole. Overall a nice game.

Not sure if I expected too much but I was a bit disappointed of the gameplay. Some people give 10/10 points but it's really not that good.
Production Value is fantastic, Art work is outstanding.

It does tick a lot of the right boxes. But by the end of the day you want to spend money on a game that you will actually play and this game has only hit the table a handful of times. There are other games I just like to play more often. Matter of fact, I like to play all other games (apart from the Fatansy Flight games I own) more often than Scythe. 

I love to open the box of Scythe. I enjoy the game but that's it. I finish the game , pack the box and put it away. Not in a regretful way but it's not like I feel like to play another round. Other games I own leave a feeling of satisfaction much as Scythe but also an urge to think about the next time I can play this game. 

Scythe... doesn't do that to me. 

If you are looking for a very good ENTRY level game. This is it. I would recommend it as that. Otherwise, you may want to have a few test plays before carving out the money.

Beautiful production that tries to provide a little something for everyone. Looks good and plays fast, although tends to end quite suddenly. There's a nice engine building aspect to appease the eurogamers, and a simple area control and combat system to attract the rest.

The engine building side is much more pronounced: There's very little actual combat in the game, just a constant threat of opponents moving into unprotected areas. Movement seems initially too hard and subsequently too easy - Pretty much all locations on the map eventually appear to be no further than two hexes away because of the numerous shortcuts. This makes visualizing the board situation way tougher than it needs to be.

RATING: 6
Special Edition. One five player game in so far. Took about 1.5-2 hours going through the rules and 6 hours playing the game + eating. It's an ok game based on the experience. I would probably have enjoyed the game more if it was designed having more layers in mind. For example, combat could be more interesting, game doesn't have a shared market place where players can purchase items under other players nose and there is no alliance victories. I might still give this game a second play in the future since I think the other gamers enjoyed it more. However personally I feel there exists better games out there. For alternatives, I would suggest looking into Eclipse or Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game (these 2 are awfully long though). For shorter games than those two consider New Dawn or Nations.

I love Scythe. Beautiful, complex, elegant mechanics, downright cool theme, what else could you ask for?

I'm not so hot on the kickstarter model though.  You can only buy this game right now on Amazon.... for $125... but you still won't get the expansion?  Why would you release an expansion at launch? That should just be included. (especially since it's required to have more than 5 players)  It's just a money grab. It's not a deal breaker because this game is great, but I just don't think the way this game and other Kickstarter games are produced is always a good thing for us, the players.

With that said, I might buy it at $125 and another $25 for the expansion.  It's just that good.

RATING: 9
A beautiful game with some really great mechanics, that I can not seem to win. The main selling point here is with the upgraded realistic resource tokens and metal coins in addition to the gorgeous artwork, you really feel in the moment of the imagined post-war w/mechs vibe of Scythe. 

For the life of me though, I am terrible at this game. I've played it 7-8 times at this point (oct 31, 2016) and am pretty sure I've yet to come in any place but last. The game rewards players for using their factions' abilities to their full potential, but for some reason I just can't quite develop a real skill for the game. Still a great game that's always fun to play, though.

Managed to be part of the playtesters for this game. A truly enjoyable experience as I have never playtested a game before. Thank you for Jamey of Stonemaier Games for the opportunity.

It took a while to craft all the pieces and assemble the parts required for the games. The map was printed on A3 and it was still not enough then I had to cull components from a number of games.

A regret was that I was not able to do more playtesting and I did not get the Art version of the game because the initial idea was that the art book will be separate from the game. Still I am stunned with the quality of the final product. Looking to play again with the final version.

Initial Impression: I've only played with the Collector's Edition and I have to admit that the artwork and component quality exceeded my hyped expectations. The board is colorful and spacious. The card artwork is wonderful. I especially love the indented player boards, something I wish more games would have. Of course, I'm blown away by the resource tokens. The gameplay is very surprisingly quick for a game of this nature, with a deliciously restricting number of options per turn. Keep in mind that this is not a wargame, or even a hybrid. I find this to be a very well tuned, enjoyable euro with war theme. I find that your strategy will be defined for you at the beginning of the game by the faction boards you receive. At that point, it becomes a concentrated game of optimization and a race to accumulate the most VPs before the game trigger ends. Overall I enjoy this game alot and look forward to many more sessions.

Scythe is a game that mixes a number of aspects into its game play, including engine building, asymmetric player powers, area control and a sprinkling of combat. The mixture is quite good. It's well-produced, smoothly designed and plays in a reasonable time. The somewhat basic puzzle of optimizing your play in view of the faction and player mats works well in combination with how the board play develops. In the early game, you work on your engine. Towards the end of the game, the board play becomes more important. If you have the right set of players around the table, there's subtle board play to uncover. Add in a well-made solo-mode and you have a very good package. I look forward to playing it.

Art Connoisseur Edition.

Love the artwork and the overall production quality. The realistic resources are a nice touch.

Euro worker placement, with some player conflict and a good deal of variability depending on the faction and faction mat you are dealt. 

It actually took a couple of Automa plays to see game strategy a little more comprehensively. Even after several plays I only feel like I'm barely scratching the surface of understanding how to play Scythe well. Perhaps I'm a bit of a slow study and perhaps it speaks to the depth of this game, or maybe a little of both. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A terrific game that is definitely worth the hype.  I love that players can decide how best to play the game (passive, aggressive, or in-between) and that most of the game has very little luck involved.  I think the best part of the game is that turns play quickly, and so there is very little down time.  Even though the game takes 2 hours to play, it definitely doesn't feel like it.  Plus, the artwork on the board and the game pieces is awesome; the board itself is basically art worthy of framing!

This said, however, it does take a bit before the game makes sense, and the sheer amount of rules and options per turn can easily overwhelm new players, though I appreciate that the game design keeps players from having to think through too many decisions each turn.  The length of time to play a game (the box is right about that two-hour mark) also means that this will, sadly, not make many appearances at our game table, but it is nice to know that those who have played it like it, and there is the "Automa" edition in case I get an itching to play but have no one to do so with!

Way overhyped. The game feels like an unnecessarily overcomplicated Terra Mystica and doesn't feel cohesive between early-mid-late game. It's nearly impossible to tell where you stand in points as compared to others until the last turn or two. Granted I didn't understand all of the rules fully the first time through, but the game design made no attempt to make the rules flow any easier. The layout of each player's tableau was so unintuitive, I was genuinely surprised it made it to print in it's current iteration. After an arduous game (where the winner scored nearly 70 points above our competitive second through fourth place players, not all of whom were new to the game), I was told that some of the races weren't even playable yet (or that all couldn't be played at the same time) because an expansion pack hadn't been put out yet. If your game isn't finished, don't publish it. I'll probably give it one last go now that I'm familiar with all of the rules and my friend seemed to enjoy it, but my first experience left the most sour of tastes in my mouth. At this point, I wouldn't recommend Scythe to a friend.

Spel met zeer veel mogelijkheden qua winnende strategieën; in eerste speling niet zo veel interactie, maar juist voldoende voor mij.  Ik had zelf méér combat kunnen uitlokken, en zo meer punten scoren.
Goede combi van economie (geld en resources verzamelen), combat (terreinen zijn wat schaars), evenwicht tussen populair zijn (hartjes) en aggressief.

Er is hier heel wat hype rond; dat begrijp ik weliswaar niet zo goed.
Graag terug spelen, maar er zijn spelen waar ik meer plezier aan beleef.

Where to start?

On top of its obvious excellent aspects like...

- amazing art, theme & well... beauty
- great mechanics, presented visually in an almost perfect way
- superb components (especially with the real ressources)

...it explores sort of new grounds in the genre (which is really inbetween genres) by making the threat of war somewhat graspable and equally meaningful as escalation itself.

We had every of the above mentioned aspects hundreds of times before and yes, even better (except the artwork perhaps)... but the sum of it all is simply a work of art.

A fine-tuned elegant & beautiful machine, where all the important parts are coming & and working effortlessly together.

And just as a personal sidenote: This has been my very first Kickstarter campaign, and even if I observed and backed some more in the meantime, Jamey's campaign has been possibly the best foundation and experience... not only for a crowdfunding newcomer but for crowdfunding in general.

The hype seems to be real. Though this game has the threat of combat, it is more of a Euro, resource management, engine building game. The art and components are very good. The random setups with the player boards seems to guarantee plenty of re-playability. The stars are a little confusing as one can easily win even if they only have four stars, depending on how they are doing with the rest of their areas. I don't think 7 player is great, though the two new factions are interesting. Adding the realistic resources and metal coins enhances the experience.

Love this game. Took a few games to see how good it is. It's a combination of Risk and Settlers of Catan, with all the luck taken out (no dice) and way more complexity and strategy. Lots of paths to victory. Lots of variety based on what character you're assigned. The game design is also amazing.

RATING: 9
Very underrated game, bit of a sleeper hit really  ;-) ( I have 5 plays now).

I just finished a 4 player game with 3 other hard core gamers at a monthly meet up.
I opened up the board, then added the extended board ......there were gasps.
I knew this  game was going to go down a treat with this group and I was very interested to hear their opinions, which I value a lot.

Approx 40 minutes into game play, Ade proclaimed " this is awesome, I want to play it again!" ( that doesn't happen often).

As I said, these guys mop up anything thrown their way and as a group we have played some epic hard core games such as Di Macher,  Rune wars, Dominant species , Terra Mystica,  Magic Realm.

So how did the guys rate Scythe? . "Love it, awesome, give it an 8" , "best artwork I have ever seen in a game - ever!"  another 8. , an 8.5 also . These guys are super mean with ratings so this is very high praise indeed . 

All want to see the "Art book" , which I do not have.

I love the fact that this game can be set up in 10 minutes and took down and into the box is not much more.  

Pros:
It's quick set up
It's quick to groc
Many different mechanisms that seamlessly meld together
Super smooth game play 
It's fun!
It can get tense
Great playtime 
Outstanding components
Breathtaking art

Cons
We don't own the art book (yet)

Fantastic game. Love it.

Beautiful artwork. A+ component quality. And the game is good too! The game is a Euro that hints at its American elements which is a plus for me. If anything the game feels a bit too solitaire-ish (especially at low player counts) but even if you aren't fighting you're still always maneuvering like it could happen. Lots of replayability. The game isn't without it's flaws (semi-scripted opening, end game can be a let down) but I don't consider them major issues. I don't expect this game to ever leave my collection and look forward to playing the expansions.

Update: 8.5 => 9

Yeah, this is really good. Scythe delivers on a solid, clean, easy to understand design. Yet, you have many tough decisions to make throughout the game. Which strategies to pursue for stars is really intense. We played 3 player with the black faction winning. He was able to get to the Factory first and had a great card which boosted Popularity. Combat is not necessary, but can give 2 easy stars depending on Power and Combat cards. Also, this game is beautiful. The minis are spot on and the board is amazing as well. Easy Top 10 game for me and it will see many plays in the future. And, it has an Automa for solo play! Winner, winner, mech dinner.

Scythe has it's unique flavor for some; how the lore, art and smart design for set pieces work in sync with the mechanics allowing to sort of carve your own story in this world.

I would recommend this to others for the sake of them trying the very least; however what bothered me really was how it felt taxing and robotic when reached mid-game; where you just forget the mythos and focus solely on your engine building

RATING: 6
90% of my first play-through was spent staring at my player board. Mechs and character minis are gorgeous but they don't actually do very much. I was disappointed to only get one of my four mechs off my player board and use it only twice in combat. There's a lot more to this game than I experienced on my first play-through and the game will be more rewarding for those who've crested the steep learning curve. However, what I observed was players moving around a lot of little bits, mostly on player boards, in order to accomplish very little on the main board. If this game were more streamlined and more combative, it would be awesome.

I like this game a lot -- very clever mechanics, nice Euro with some combat. But I don't quite love it. I think that's because I feel like when I don't do well it's not because I miscalculated but because I just forgot about something, which is a little unsatisfying. Maybe with more plays I'd enjoy it on a higher level.

I would categorize this as euro-war game, some similarities in the play feeling with Eclipse. There is developing your own production and simple war, but in the end it is optimizing victory point collection. Certainly a heavy game.

We've only got Scythe on the table once so far.  My initial impressions are: a) the Collector Edition's components are outstanding (I haven't seen the normal edition); b) relatively simple mechanics; c) sweet sweet resource management; d) salty arear control; e) quick and meaningful combat; and f) multiple paths to victory.  I suspect (and hope) we are going to play the shit out of this game.

Hello,

After so many reviews read for this game and for the other one (Terraforming Mars) finally Scythe manage to win and I've bought it and played with my wife. Indeed the game is brilliant and it has a great artwork. Everything at this game, regarding its components, is screaming of quality.

The gameplay is solid and very well balanced. I can wait to play it more with my friends.

Thanks!

have you ever wondered what wwi would be like if everybody had huge mechs instead of poison gas and trenches? well scythe won't show you that.
have you ever played settlers of catan and wished you were playing a better game? well look no further, here's scythe. will says this game is a euro. apparently europeans love to ruthlessly exploit the land and stockpile resources...
i loved this game even though its a euro. however my main gripe is, combat is kinda discouraged. like why do i even have this mech? its for killing shit. not to be a peasant bus. and why do i get unpopular for stomping on enemy peasants? of course they hate me, they're the enemy.
the collectors edition is nice. there's metal coins, well sculpted resource tokens. a massive board. is it worth it? actually yes.  
small children will enjoy the themes of nationalism, militarism, the exploitation of natural resources, and the benefits of serfdom. would highly recommend as indoctrination tool or light weekend fun.

Very glad I backed this one on Kickstarter. It is that perfect mix of theme and mechanics. On the surface it may look like a war game. But in it's heart it's an optimization/engine building game. It has a pretty steep learning curve but once you get into it, the game becomes a quick game also. So very involved gameplay in a relative short amount of time. Love that. The rules do a great job of teaching you the game and it's always easy to find stuff when questions come up during the game. Even the solo variant is enjoyable!

Then we have to mention the components. Mini's are decent, love the resources, money and dual layered player boards. But the real star in this department is the artist (Jakub Rozalski) who made a work of art for every card and player mat. The art is so evocative and beautiful that it in itself creates most of the theme. When you look at the bare bones gameplay, it is pretty dry. But Jakub's artwork transports you to this alternate reality and adds a ton to the game. Minor component issue: you really need the board extension, the standard board is just too small.

By all of the standard gaming norms that I follow, I shouldn't have enjoyed Scythe as much as I have. What I mean is that it follows the standard formulaic Euro mechanics that we have been accustomed to, but the presentation, components, interaction with other players and the fun factor have elevated it into a delightful pastime. It also helps that it doesn't overstay it's welcome and that the design is intuitive and easily explained.

Excellent Euro-style/largely deterministic game. There is enough variation with the different combinations of cards and characters to provide very different experiences and preserved depth with repeated gameplay, further enhanced by the expansion pack. It is complicated to set up and follow the rules correctly the first couple of play-throughs; however, after several games now, it seems to be simpler than Terra Mystica or Eclipse, but with many comparable features.

Tried on tuesday august 2nd - twice!

Aaaaaaand, we have a new "best game of 2016 so far". In all fairness I have barely played any 2016 games, but this one is indeed very good. Looks like the hype was justified. We managed to finish two games in 3 hours and I'm am very satisfied. The only thing I'm not satisfied about is my decision not to back it on Kickstarter. I had all but decided to take the plunge when I heard that one of my main gaming buddies was backing it. Since I already own too many games that main gaming buddies also own, I decided to skip it. On the other hand I want to own the true great games and this looks to be one of them. There are plenty of things to like here:

- Production quality is top notch. Sure, gameplay is more important, but production quality enhances your gaming experience. At least it does to me. This is a great EURO with quite a few miniatures! How awesome is that? I love miniatures but usually don't like the trashy games that has them. More euros with miniatures please! This is a major part of the reason why I will probably end up buying the game.

- Variable factions. Factions with different powers are awesome. Eclipse or Terra Mystica wouldn't be the same games without the factions and neither would this. Factions create excitement, variability and the eagerness to play the game more to try everything out. In short, I love factions. Furthermore, the upgrade boards are assigned randomly, so its not just a matter of having a particular faction, but also a particular upgrade board. Excellent variability!

- Upgrading. Upgrading is awesome and there are multiple ways to upgrade your abilities here. It is a truly fascinating part of the game.

As I have only played it twice there are also some uncertainties:

- Are the factions balanced? I don't know yet. Also I would hate it if it became so that the faction more or less dictated how you should play. I hope the game never becomes scripted.

- Interaction? I'm sure interaction will increase with more plays, but during the two games we had, I think we were all absorbed with our own game.

- Game length. The game was MUCH shorter than expected. We started at 7PM, talked briefly about some key rules, played the first game, tore it down and set up a second game and played the second game and we were done at something like 10:10PM. As for pure playing time we were probably looking at 80 minutes per game for 4 players. If you focus too much on upgrading stuff, then the other players will finish before you get many stars on the board. In both games we had a player who didn't get a single star on the board at the end of the game.

Anyway, my takeaway is VERY positive. This is a game that will be sure to delight the euro crowd. Time will tell if the game is as good as it appears to be.

Excellent strategy and civilization-building style game. I love the asymmetrical aspect of the game. Every faction plays differently and has different advantages they should capitalize on. I feel that the game has the right amount of combat too. Large portions will be a tense Cold War scenario, but the combats that DO happen usually decide a good portion of the game's outcome.

I love the game with 3 and 4, 5 is a bit crowded, I will never bother playing with 6.

Edit: Upgraded rating from 8.5 to 9.0 after several more plays. This has become such an excellent puzzle of engine-optimization. I really love the challenges you're faced with thanks to having a different player mat each game.

Good modern Euro game, but to much stuff. The game feels awfully slow, but takes very long. You only get a low number of turns for the playtime.

Only 3 plays in (thus far) but I'm really enjoying the game.  The factions do feel different and there is definitely a sense of tension as the stars come out and you spread into the land, positioning your mechs in order to defend against other players and to position for the late game factory run.

Looking forward to exploring the factions further and trying other player counts (only 2 player so far).

RATING: 8
Played several times at game night, and I have to say while I am impressed, the game isn't exactly my thing. It is very heavy, complex, and lengthy (the box play time is kind of hilarious to our group). I do think it is a tad over rated in the fun department, since the game ends abruptly and has a fairly weak theme in my eyes. With the exception of the Polania Republic class, I never really "feel" like I am a certain type of group one way or the other. It just feels like normal "dudes on a map" most of the time - not a bad thing, just not normally my kind of thing.

However, it is a masterpiece of mechanics and design. The board is stunning, especially if you have the expansion for it. The tokens and wood bits are nice quality, and the game shines even brighter if you get metal coins. The way you determine actions is very inventive and unique, forcing you to think turns ahead of where you currently are. It plays like a well oiled, fascinating machine of economical growth and power. As weak as the theme is, and as dry as it can be from turn to turn, it does become a beast greater than the sum of its parts to me. A fascinating experience, to be sure. 

If you like heavy Euro's, you are going to love this game. Even if you don't, it might have enough on offer for you to find enjoyment out of it anyway.

CE 10516, 
I first saw this game at Essen 2015, but did not get a chance to play in a demo because there were too many people that would get to the table first. The kickstarter for this game came out soon after Essen and I pledged for the basic edition on my first time. After working out the pros and cons of "do I want realistic resources or not, metal coins or not, extended board or not" I finally switched my pledge to the collectors edition, and I am so happy I did. All the components are fantastic and now I have one of the rare collector's edition that many people are wishing they had. 
Made by the same designer as Euphoria and Viticulture, you can see some of the elements that worked so well in the aforementioned games put into Scythe.

I love this game. Almost 100% strategy and little luck, outside potentially getting a sub-optimal setup. Great production qualities and atmosphere. A lot going on, which keeps it interesting.

I can't give it a 10 for two reasons:

1. It's not for the faint of heart. Hardcore gamers only!

2. If you get the wrong people playing - the "analysis paralysis" types - the game can take 4+ hours and nobody has fun. The funny thing is, it's usually the fault of the people who are MAKING it no fun by not playing expeditiously.

I'm developing a love/hate relationship with Scythe.  I love the challenge of figuring out each action board.

Really good thematics and game components - like with all Stonemaier games. It really looks and feels like premium, like something very special. The graphics and other visuals of the game are amazing.
However the game just somehow doesn't come together in a complete structure. It lacks something, and so far I couldn't figure out what is this. I felt a bit bored during the gameplay and there was no real interation, was more like a solitair gameplay...

Initial Impressions:
-------------------------
Interesting optimization game with some of the best art ever put into a game.  The combat system sure seems like blind bidding, and I am not sure I like that part of the game very much, but the combat really ends up not being the most important aspect of the game.  The decisions are tough, and there is an interesting mix of objective cards, encounter cards, structure bonus cards, and faction / player boards to keep every game feeling different.  This game is more Euro than anything, but it does a nice job trying to fit in a theme, and also be a dudes on a map game.  Keeper for sure (the components in the collectors edition are unreal), and would be shocked if this didn't make my top 10 of 2016.  Played well at 2p, and very interested in trying it at the other  player counts.

I waited to complete 5 games before rating so to not fall for the hype. We played only 2 player games so far (some back to back). The rating could easily go up for multiplayer games (or down with time).

Whilst there is nothing unseen before, the mix of mechanics works very well. The theme is very strong and well integrated for what is a Euro-game about maximizing efficiency at it's core.
The game encourages, but doesn't force aggression and the amount and importance of combat completely depends on the players.
Component quality is great except for some peeling edges on the player and faction mats.

My first play through was with a group of 3 strangers, with none of us having played the game before. 

We were lucky to have a seasoned player nearby to help us get started and explain rules and tactics along the way. I recommend having someone like this in every first play through. Short of that, setting up and just diving into the game is the next best option.

It is a complicated game to learn but a very fun one to go on a journey with, especially since watching players figure out different tactics produces many "a-ha!" moments in your own understanding of the mechanisms behind the game. 

It does take a few turns to get a fair handle on what to do and how to go about it. The wonderful thing is that even if you have no idea how to play strategy when you start, once you finally formulas one it isn't too late to play it and feel the benefits of it. 

After the game was over our group had a great time discussing what we learned and how to do better next time. 

really fun game and highly recommended. Also very pretty.

Scythe is a decent enough game. I enjoy the game well enough but it's not an amazing game. I for instance am very conscious of the group which I would play this with.

This game is slim, streamlined, and tight and there isn't enough meat on the bones to get stretched out by slow players.

RATING: 3
Not a bad game, but it suffers from the euro problem that a major setback in the beginning of the game (like losing a battle and 4+ resources) is insurmountable.  Whenever euros try to be wargames, they fail.  They're not sophisticated enough, and Scythe is a perfect example of this.

But, in spite of the above, a fairly fun journey, I'd play every once in a while, but definitely needs to have the right crowd -- especially because the game can REALLY suffer if you're playing with a bozo who has a bad case of A/P.

Like this one a lot - It kind of scratches the same itch as Terra Mystica did for me, a game my group did not like too much. I really like the fact that it plays very fast, but it tends to be a little bit multiplayer-solitaire and a VERY silent experience with my group. Nevertheless, a brilliant design: very elegant, lots of choices and just the right amount of brain-burning for my taste. As many have already written: don'expect a wargame, it's "only" a very good euro with phenomenal artwork and top notch components.

The variable player powers feel imbalanced (including base powers and mech powers), the exploration cards are too luck heavy (e.g., getting the sweet pay $4 for a mech card in the first round is huge), and the tech advancement feels clunky.  The center hex bonus of getting a new personal action (factory card) is a big deal, and it's hard or impossible to stop the leader from grabbing the best factory card quickly because movement is so heavily restricted early in the game.  The game seems wrought with rich-get-richer problems since players that get an early lead can begin to steamroll the map (with extra dudes and +1 movement) and race through the tech tree (player board), while other players scrape to get by with little/no catch-up mechanisms.  There are too many assymetric powers to memorize and guard against.  Also, it tends to be advantageous to pick on the weakest player(s) to earn cheap/easy stars for combat.  There is definitely a game here, but one that needs to be studied and perfected based on the silly assymetry and fixed/viable strategies for certain factions (e.g., blue seems to be weak unless played a certain way).  I just don't have the time or interest for this level of devotion to a game, and I'd rather play something that is less punishing for someone who doesn't know or doesn't follow the natural/optimal strategy for their faction.

Note to self:  There also seems to be an imbalance toward going "all or nothing" with production considering the steep costs of deploying mechs and building structures, meaning that you're better off keeping several worker dudes together in a single hex to make gobs of one resource rather than collecting multiple piles of goods that need to be defended and could allow you to do 2-3 different secondary actions.  It's just too hard to defend resources, and the game mechanics are too slow to make it a viable approach.  By the time you get to do all 3 actions and bonus actions and build your production engine, an opponent's army of mechs is probably knocking at your door.

Man, this game got me since the beginning :) this is what I like, solid mechanics, fast gameplay, many important decisions. This is also the most beautiful game I have in my collection - Scythe completely destroys all rivals in this category :) It looks difficult but after You read rulebook twice You will be ready to play and enjoy the game. Remember - this is NOT a war game. It is EURO game in the theme of threat of war. It might be boring for some people. Game is very expensive. You'd better try it before You will buy Scythe.

I've had three plays (one of which was solo) and I'm now confident I can rate this a 10. Is this the perfect game? Probably not. No game can be all things to all people. However, this one ticks so many boxes it comes out on top. 

Scythe delivers 80% of the epicness of Runewars or Mage Knight in under 2 hours playtime. This alone means its going to hit the table 5x more often than those games. The game is thinky and strategic rather than laugh-out-load chaotic. The infrequent combat is a big advantage with my kids where battles invariably leave someone in tears (I'm not talking figuratively). Games start gently with players building their economy. Towards the endgame the play becomes quite tense as players bang out stars and people are scrambling to maximise their endgame scoring position or exploit an opponents weakness.

Clearly the theme/art/components are gorgeous. The game-play doesn't break new ground in any one area but remains excellent in all areas. This game is the ultimate all-rounder.

Probably the weakest aspect of the game would be at low player count where the player interaction is low and the finite range of starting setups (25 faction/action mat combos) and lack of randomness in play means that it could get a little stale. Still, I'm a long way from experiencing this myself and there's an expansion already scheduled for the end of the year which will increase the faction/action combos to 49 to boost replability. At higher player counts, player-player interaction means games can take unexpected turns and replayability will be unlimited.

RATING: 5.25
Scythe is a solid game with a bad theme/mechanics disconnect. At its core its an efficiency optimizatioh game. You're doing a set amount of actions on the map and you're trying to do them in the optimal order. There is conflict to shake things up and interfere with your plans, but it's not a central feature. You're awarded stars for reaching certain milestones and usually that means there's no point in continueing this path anymore. You build a strong produce / build engine and then you ignore it for the rest of the game. You build 4 mechs. You aren't going to use them, but the 4th gives you a star. So you build him put him on a tile somewhere and forget about him. Then you might complete an objective, which meant in our game that you do a weird move action and distribute your pieces in a weird order on the map, and then claim, that you did something important.

Freedom of strategy is rather low. Your starting position and action board encourages a certain optimal path. There may be more variants but in the 1 game I played I quickly figured out that for me there was only 1 opening I should play with only slight variations of going into mid game. Late game means finishing stars from your checklist in order to finish the game and you have some similiar options of where to go there.

It's a fun puzzle nonetheless and I could play it quickly without thinking too much, but I felt it was too long and solo-ish for the depth that it offers.

This is a game I pegged myself as enjoying.  I love economic games where you expand over a board like Terra Mystica and Power Grid.  The theme is fantastic.  The quality and art are great.  Stonemeier games is a great company and it is well designed.  It is a perfect length and weight BUT I just didn't get into it.  I think it just plays a little slow.  Turns are quick which many see as a plus but I think I like to have more involved turns and more stuff going on in games.  Ultimately I sold it away.

RATING: 7
Interest concept and a well crafted game.  Got that mid 1920s Communist Balkans Steampunk feel.  Fun to play, but a bit odd in that you don't really fight each other much.  It's more a game of maneuver and action management than a game of conflict.  It really is a Euro game, so a player looking to fight with their Steampunk mechs may be disappointed.  You CAN fight, but you can easily win and never really be more confrontational than to chase your opponents and their workers off of a few hexes in the course of a game.

It does look gorgeous when set up and the components are very top notch.  I did like it and would play again, but feels like their should be something more to the game.

This game is a bit on the weighty side, but only because it combines so many game elements and styles to execute a nicely balanced game.  Worker placement determines what actions can be taken in a given turn (by moving a pawn between action fields), and workers on the map determine what source of resources are produced on resource collection actions. Military units are moved around the map in a conquest mechanism that allows the ownership of territories as long as the units remain. Buildings can be placed onto territories to provide a more permanent claim to a territory, though military units will take precedence. And, there are elements of engine builders in play as your capabilities can be incrementally improved throughout the game. Each player has control of a different nation, where each has different "powers" that they can take advantage of.

Combat results in additional victory points for those that prevail, but isn't a necessary element to achieving overall victory, and units are only relocated, not destroyed when a loss in battle occurs.  Many games, especially those with a smaller group of players, can be completed without a single battle taking place.

With the Invaders from Afar expansion, up to 7 players can play at once, though that can get a bit crowded and end up taking a long time between your turns in that situation.  The expansion also adds in two new nation types with different behaviors provided for each, so even if you are not interested in 7 players, it does offer some increased play variety with those two new nations.  Plus, you get to make use of those two starting locations that are on the map that you already own.

Overall, this game offers a wonderful balance of game play, given how complex it is, and how many ways can be used to achieve victory. There is some element of "run away leader" that can take place, but leading nations do have some added costs given to them that makes performing some needed actions more expensive and can allow other players to catch up if they don't neglect their own development.

Finally, the art work, as shown in the images attached to this BGG entry, is amazing in detail and quality.  There are little "easter eggs" scattered throughout the map that are fun to find, and the overall "look and feel" of this game, with the detailed models as well, greatly enhances the experience of playing this game.

Very pretty game that had my attention from the start. Now that I've had a chance to play I'm glad I invested in it (not the cheapest game by far but you get a lot in a big box). The comparisons to Terra Mystica are quite appropriate in the way the pieces move about your Action board unlocking  and modifying costs and benefits. The resource management aspects have a familiar feel. This game involves area control as well but has the extra element of combat missing from Terra Mystica. Both games have a lot of moving parts and faction specific characteristics to be learned and exploited. Scoring is via ongoing accumulated money plus an end-game scoring which converts game elements (stars, controlled hexes and resources) into further cash - the most cash deciding the winner. Our game  went over three hours but bear in mind we were five players all brand new to the game; so, as usual, i expect the game time to come down.

One caveat to that game duration prediction is the mental mini-max player who, unless he is super fast at mental arithmetic, can slow the game to a crawl toward the end if he laboriously calculates where everyone is and recalculates everything in response to any number of final moves he may make in order to maximize his final position. The question many players will eventually have to contend with is: do I pull the trigger now (just because I can) or do I hang fire for another turn or so in an attempt to maybe pass one more player or maybe even win? Sure, lots of games have that aspect but it appears that this game is especially so owing to the way the end of the game is triggered (placing the sixth star ends the game immediately). Still, I enjoyed the first play (partly due to winning I expect) and look forward to learning more and exploring the various action/faction board combinations . 

One big issue always is staying power - will this game stand up to repeated playings? I've played Terra Mystica a fair number of times and it retains its interest, and I hope the same will be true for Scythe as well..

RATING: 4
Not the 4x I was looking for that's for sure. Play is smooth and easy to explain, which makes it great for clubs or situations where you have to explain a game to a new player (seemingly every time you break a game out). I like the way development is on your board and just works with minimal book-keeping. However the overall game feels less than the sum of it's parts.

It's too euro and too tactical for me - you can't really go in with a plan as that depends what faction you get but the multiple paths to victory are really just the same called different stuff (ie. you do the same thing to get them), and the map is too symmetrical - by the end everyone can get everywhere so there's little point in having any variety as it doesn't matter.

Overall, I'd play it but no desire to own or seek out a game.

*** Update, dropped rating to a 4 as I'm done with this (after 4 plays), first play it was 'ok', 2nd/3rd felt samey, by the fourth I'd had enough, it's too heads down, too euro, too tactical. The asymmetry is nice in theory but doesn't impact much, the missions you get that supposedly give variety don't seem to matter. Probably worse aspect is I think all 4 games felt the same, you have to get resources, you have to build mechs, you have to explore and put a few buildings down ... everyone does that, and just when you're at the point when interesting stuff could happen the game is over with 6 stars. If I'm going to play this sort of game I'd much much prefer Terra Mystica, where the races really do make a difference.

A beautiful game, well designed and replayable. Still, resource management is too easy (all costs are 1 resource type) and combat is not rewarding enough. Actions you take become repetitive, where you can just move produce and spend your resources. There are not many reasons to have platic figures in this game.

You think it's a dudes on a map game.  Not quite.  You think maybe it's an area control game.  Well, parts of it are.  Perhaps it's a 3x civ game.  Well almost...

Really it has elements of all those games and despite having only one board, there's a lot of replayability here.  It reminds me of Nexus Ops with all the mission objectives you have to keep in mind while playing.  Focus on any one aspect too hard and your on your way to last place.  I really like this one even though I'm terrible at it and find my plays of it quite enjoyable.  This was a nice surprise.

10x10 2017. Really interesting combination of dudes on a map area control with light combat, engine building/resource production, 7 different factions with special powers (when including the expansion).  There are also 7 different player mats which are pretty similar but can change your engine building strategy somewhat.  The theme of farming/war comes through very strong.  For example causing opposing workers to retreat decreases your popularity which heavily affects end game scoring so you can use you workers as a sort of shield.  Of course they're also vulnerable if they have a bunch of resources sitting there for someone to steal.  It's a neat push and pull and even though combat doesn't occur that often it does happen in pretty much every game so it's always on your mind.  The mechanism of selecting a pair of actions is really cool- hard to describe but pretty easy to get used to.  It requires some planning in the short to medium term to be efficient.  The game encourages you to pursue a bunch of different things at once so you'll need to succeed in several different facets to win.  So your strategy is always sort of "do everything (or at least 3 or 4 things) and do it efficiently" you can't just say I'm going to just do combat this time for example (unless you are the Germany faction).  I love the setting and art- in fact this is my favorite art in any board game.  The encounter cards are cool and the game tells a bit of a story if you let your imagination get into it.  One of the uncommon cases where the hype was right.  Fantastic game.

Awesome game with very little luck involved.  The map is well designed and laid out perfectly as to not give one faction an advantage over the other.  With a lot of board games I play I find myself "house-ruling" certain aspects of the rules I don't agree with or like.  Not with this one.  A game based on skill, there is a lot of room to improve how you play from game to game.  I own the Invaders From Afar expansion which gives you access to all 7 game factions.  We had one seven player game with the board extension which was truly epic.  There are so many ways you can win, and with the different combinations of player mat vs faction board there are a variety of strategies to employ.  The art and theme are fantastic. The single player Automa mode is challenging.  Had to play several times before I was able to beat it on normal difficulty.  A game like this; easy to learn, hard to master, great theme; will see my gaming table many, many times.

Currently in my top 3 "New to Me" of 2017 games.  

It's a modern euro race game where winning the race may not make you win.  Players score points for controlling territory and getting stars with each multiplied by how "popular" the player is.  

As soon as someone gets 6 stars, the game ends immediately.  So, as the game gets close to the end, there's some jockeying as players try to increase popularity and territory control at the same time that they try to trigger game end (and deny the other players the chance to do the same).  

A lot of people say this is multi-player solitaire, but I don't see it at all.  The first two or three turns (each turn is a micro-action), players are just worrying about themselves, but by turn/action four or five, players should already be bumping into each other.  If one player has bumped up their military and the other player hasn't, battling can be an easy star (or two).  This continues till the end of the game as players generally lose military might when they get into a battle (win or lose), making them vulnerable to other players and, potentially, causing a quick retreat from the contested area.  

but, this isn't just a war game.  Lots of focus on producing goods and gaining popularity and even a little bit of abstracted exploration.  Absolutely love this game.

Scythe puzzles me.  I really, really enjoy playing Scythe and yet have a hard time saying exactly why I enjoy it so much.  I think this is because Scythe comes together really well for me, so that my enjoyment is somehow more than the sum of the things I like about it. 

I like that Scythe's actions are relatively small, which allows the play to move around the table quickly.  I like that you have to do a different action each turn, so the game asks players to constantly think several moves ahead in order to be efficient.  For example, I know I want to move toward an encounter, so I take a turn to get resources to be able to use the bottom action paired with my move action.  I really like the variable player boards and faction boards that make each game different and make each faction play differently.  I think they have been balanced very well to provide a different feel without giving an unfair advantage.  I like the tension between working toward end game goals (stars) and in game money - I think the way money is used in this game is brilliant.  And, of course, the theming and production of Scythe is over the top awesome.  

My main quibble with Scythe is the ending, which is abrupt and can often come as a surprise.  It feels unthematic and a little disorienting.  I have yet to have any clue as to how I am doing before the scores are totaled - I have won when I thought I was behind, and have been hopelessly at the back when I thought I was ahead.  This is at least partly due to my own inexperience, but it is also because of how end game score is calculated - the game asks you to place stars throughout the game, but they are only maybe 50% of your total score.  So doing well demands that you keep careful track of where the rest of your score is coming from, and make sure to optimize that too.  

Overall, Scythe is a game I will probably always want to play.  A great experience in 2 hours or less.

Un estupendo juego de exploración y cumplir objetivos. Lo que más me gusta es la inmediatez del turno. Lo único que hay que hacer es escoger una acción (y opcionalmente ejecutar la siguiente acción asociada).

El juego es asimétrico (tiene siete razas diferentes con habilidades propias). El panel de acciones también es diferente para cada jugador. 

Hay bastante interacción y el juego en realidad es una carrera. La partida termina en el momento que un jugador obtiene seis estrellas (que se pueden conseguir diversas formas).

Es adecuado para jugones. Muy entretenido. Partidas dinámicas entre dos y tres horas. Si se sabe jugar y se es rápido, a 4 jugadores se puede jugar en hora y poco.

RATING: 8.5
Es un juego ambientado en unos hipotéticos años 20 de postguerra en el que cinco potencias (hasta siete con la expansión) luchan por tener la hegemonía de la europa del este. La ambientación tampoco es gran cosa. Cada jugador tiene una combinación de tablero de potencia y tablero de acciones. 

En tu turno, sólo puedes realizar una acción (colocar el trabajador en una casilla del tablero de acciones).  Y al hacerlo puedes optar por no hacer nada, realizar una acción de la parte superior o además, la de la parte inferior. 

La asimetría en las potencias y en las combinaciones de potencias/tableros de acción dan una enorme rejugabilidad. El juego termina cuando alguien consigue colocar las seis estrellas de objetivo conseguido. Se pueden colocar estrellas cuando:
- Cumples una carta objetivo secreta
- Ganas una batalla
- Desarrollas todos los merch
- Haces todos los updates
- Completas todos los alistamientos
- Construyes todas las estructuras

Hay dos tracks en el juego que son importantes: El poder (sirve para los combates, básicamente) y la popularidad, que básicamente es un track de multiplicación para otros parámetros del juego.

Al final del juego, todo se convierte en dinero (territorios ocupados, estrellas conseguidas, materiales, etc) y  el que más pasta tiene gana.

Está muy entretenido. Las acciones son sencillas, pero dan mucha profundidad al juego. La asimetría de las facciones (y tableros de acciones) son los que aportan mayor interés.. en buscar cómo aprovechar las ventajas de tu facción, con el tablero que te ha tocado.

Es una delicia para jugones. Para no jugones, mejor no intentarlo. Les va a parecer muy lioso.

If you like Castles of Burgundy or Agricola, then you will probably like Scythe. I could take or leave those games.

I liked it first play, but felt it would get better. 10 plays later, and the flaws have become more and more clear.

Firstly, it has an interesting action selection mechanism. Fairly accessible due to the streamlined rules and theme. Pretty.

However, despite its accessibility, setup/rules explanation takes longer than you would like for a game of this weight. There's enough minor randomness that it's annoying, and it's questionable why it's even there.

The variable player powers are some of worst I've ever encountered. Plenty of games have boring powers, but these are totally artificial, made to break rules that are only there to be broken. I wonder how fun Scythe would be if you remove the penalty for attacking workers, made combat stars limitless, or got rid of the obnoxious starting islands completely.

And the coup de grâce. There is little to no interaction. Combat is at best rare, and pretty much optional if you want it to be. And that's it. There's no other form of interaction. You gather resources, shuffle around cubes, rinse-repeat, maybe attack a lone mech for a quick star, then the game ends.

I sound like I hate it. I don't. It's fine. But it's just another game in a long list of low-interaction point salads, and other games do what it purports to do better.

If I wanted a Euro game with combat, I'd play Tigris & Euphrates. If I wanted a game which involves upgrading bits on your board, I'd play Terra Mystica. If I wanted a mid-weight Euro game that's accessible, I'd play Concordia. Though it's definitely the prettiest Euro game around!

Fantastic first play. Moved along much more quickly than I thought, and even though we had 4 players who were all playing for the first time, there was very little downtime between turns.

After my one play, I can say the production is great, and the gameplay is challenging, as players try to complete the assignments to gain Stars. A lot is going on in your own 'world,' but there is a need to be aware of your opponents progress, as the game can end abruptly. The advancements on your home board is methodical, but there are sudden changes that take place with the movement of other players mechs especially. So there is a bit of chaos, but they do not really influence your position that much on the main board. Overall, I'd rather play a game that includes chaos but make it work (Kemet), or allow for the methodical progress of your grand strategy with minimal interruption (Terra Mystica).

I really appreciate the variability this game has. The thing i enjoy the most in games is trying different strategies each time i play them. With the different combinations  of factions and player boards available, this game forces me to do it each time.  Also, it can be easily played in less than 2 hours and it can be introduced to less seasoned players, so it can frequently hit the table.

I am still unsure how to rate this game (a solid 7, even an 8?). My first reaction was kind of meh (good but not great), but I must admit I have liked it a bit more with every new play. That is really surprising because I expected the opposite to happen. After 4 plays in, I am even considering adding it to my collection.

We tested this with 3 players now, and I have to admit I'm hellishly impressed.

I skipped over this at Spiel 2016 because at first glance it seemed like there was mostly an element of military territorial control, and those are not just my type of games. Never read up about it either.

After now seeing a few reviews and hearing from friends about it I realized I misjudged this, and I got it.

And I should have gotten it sooner..

The presentation is *gorgeous*, the balance seems to be nice from the little I've tried yet (we had the Poland player dominate during the game but *not* win, which was a nice reversal), and the playtime/setup is less obnoxious than I thought it'd be for a game this weight.

Also, and I give it huge credit for this, the way the faction and economy boards combine to change the gameplay experience is great. A worker placement / economy game with a rather epic or 4X-style sense to it, despite still having a rather short playtime.

Two thumbs up. Impressive.

RATING: 9
While I find the game interesting, it can be a bit too solitaire at time. Might go down in rating, despite having played both with Invaders and Wind Gambit. It feels especially solitaire with fewer than 4 players, although due to the aggressive nature of Automas it might be more interesting to add a few in games featuring 2 or 3 players, and those might end up more interesting then the human-only ones.

This is the most hyped game I've ever seen...and I jumped on the Kickstarter-train with a very expensive ticket. I hope I don't regret it.

I unpacked the whole thing.
Wow that looks pretty cool. Too bad I didn't order another set of realistic ressources and another set of coins. I like the components. They are really fantastic.

My only negatives are:
-the blue coins. I don't like the color.
-the design of the combat wheel (I would have preferred a design like in Dune or anything from FFG where the number shines through)
-my boards warp a bit but not too bad. Nothing that needs to be replaced.

That's it.

The artwork is absolutely beautiful. I like it so much that I ordered a picture of it to hang it to my wall.
[EDIT: By now I have four pictures on my walls.]

The rules are well written and the design is very elegant. Nothing is dispensable. Perfect.

The gameplay is simple and fun and intense and diverse.

I don't want to continue the hype but Scythe really stood up to it and Jamey Stegmeier showed how it's done once again.

I was a little predisposed to lack of enthusiasm for Scythe, because of its great current hype. But I did enjoy it. I found it surprisingly easy to pick up, and with the asymmetry of the various nations, I could play them each a couple of times before the game would be in any peril of getting stale.

Scythe is a very neat hybrid game. The centerpiece of the game isn't the beautiful board, but rather it's the player boards. Before we even started playing, we were very fascinated by the different ways the player boards were set up. When paired with the faction board, this gives a ton of different paths to build towards. I'm looking forward to seeing how each of the various boards pair together and how it will affect my way of playing.

RATING: 8.5
An interesting, surprisingly light Euro-Ameritrash hybrid. I say "surprisingly" because, despite all the bells and whistles in that huge box, the game at its core is a pretty simple area control game with some neat, easy-to-understand scoring mechanisms. I love that you can score points for doing all sorts of things, making combat only one small part of the gameplay. In this regard, the game reminds me of Eclipse: apart from some small skirmishes, players generally spend the game diversifying as they gear up for the aggressive endgame.

If I had one complaint, it's that the goals are a little too easy to get, and are mostly fulfilled by all players the end of the game. So, by the end most people will have built all of their mechs. Most people will max out their workers, etc. 

I wish there were more ways to specialize (i.e. to score more points within a particular strategy), and thus vary your strategy from game to game: so, a "mech strategy" would incentivize going heavy into mechs early, and then provide more ways to score with them. A "worker strategy" would do the same within that track. As it is, each play of this feels kind of "samey."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game but it tends to play pretty solitaire. As it turns out, through several plays there is rarely any competition for territory and therefore combat is typically done for the star and not out of necessity. Would like to have seen that element added. Otherwise a cool engine building game.

1/29/17 A very good,  extremely well produced game that I'm unfortunately not very good at after 2 plays.  Other than that,  the biggest issue may be the downtime between turns although this is probably due to 3 of the five players having never played before.  I think my rating might rise after more plays.

Excellent in unexpected ways.  Not sure what kind of game it is, in a good way.  My initial respect and enjoyment of the game is tempered a bit by the lack of meaningful inter player conflict, though "bravo" to the designer for the tunnels.  They make for surprise attacks that add some of that conflict.

Waited 2 years before playing it and putting my hands on it. I don't really follow hyped games and ignore games that take longer than 60 minutes to play since I rarely have the time to play longer games. I mostly play with my wife but I started playing games solo like Pandemic Iberia and discovered how fun it was even just playing by myself. So I searched for some of the best games that play solo and multiplayer and Scythe was the one that interested me the most. I debated a lot over Viticulture but I already have worker placement games. Since I got it I played 4 times multiplayer which was awesome and so easy to get into and teach. The game goes by so quickly you don't even notice. After 2 hours I wanted to keep going. I also played 2 player in exactly 1 hour and that was also really fun. Then I played solo and found that learning how the Automa works is really easy and fun since you still play like in a multiplayer game. I am so excited to play with multiple Automa once I'm faster at playing the Automa's turn. Overall this is an excellent game that plays in quick for this type of game and simple but deep strategic game play. Plus I love the world it's sets in. I want posters of some of the artwork.

I won my first game (or should've if the rules were explained properly/enforced about placing buildings). But why would I not need or even want to play scythe again? It's a very smooth euro, great production, escalating engine, contains all the mechanics you would want. But because of what it seeks to deliver, ie a stellar euro, I have issues with some parts of the game. 

1. The output randomness of the encounter cards. Yes there are 3 options. But there's no denying that there will be some options which are optimal for some boards and sub-optimal for others. 

2. Which links to the second problem of the assymetry. Scythe as many have stated seems to be an efficiency engine of your top board and your bottom board. And unless you draft (which seems silly and unnecessary) you will find that some board pairings are better or just instinctively more suitable to some players than others. Yes I know it's been playtested to death. But I think Scythe was meant to be a euro that wowed you on its first play and enticed you to play more and had the legs for more plays. I think it fails on the first count because people can have such varying first experiences. 

3. It gets boring. Yes we played 6p so downtime was probably more than anticipated. But again, everyone felt like they were waiting for their turn and worse, everyone was staring at their boards instead of the map in the middle. As stated many times, scythe is not a 4x. It's not close especially when one can ignore the map (turtle) and win. 

4. I think i have issues with the popularity and combat stars. Particularly that you can't lose the star once you obtain it. Yes, it's a race. But the popularity track then becomes infinitely more important than the combat because it affects end game scoring. Hence, it favours the player boards that enable cheap popularity bumps towards the end of their engine (that's my gut feel). 

I say this knowing I only had one play. But knowing that I'll be ok without a second.

RATING: 7
My very first impression was 'this board game is huge, where should I store it?' Pretty well summed up how my group needs a bigger table and in the end, we play Scythe always on the floor. Yep, you got it right. We do need always to have more than two mats in order to keep them in shape. Mechanic-wise, I think this game can be seen as refreshing but not yet revolutionary. I like how we should play the game, but there's this lack of interaction between players beside the combat. Economic-wise, it's good that to generate economy, we do not have to be dependent on the dice rolling. Every choice matters. I would like to wait for the expansion, as for now, the replayability is quite low since Scythe has this static and quite restricting yet beautifully drawn map.

Played once, not super impressed. Very messy, scattershot, unfocussed design - tons of levers to pull, but in practice extremely constrained choices. An odd mix of an efficiency design with a point salad aesthetic - a ton of tracks and different ways to score points, but an economic development engine that forces you to specialize.

This style of unfocussed design really doesn't do a lot for me. I had just played 504 the previous night, world 468 (Military, Roads, Production). The general feel of the game is actually kind of similar - a sort-of wargame where the main activity is actually building up your infrastructure - but because 504 is such a focussed design, it routinely gives you interesting and important choices and it feels way more engaging. And to be clear, this game (468) was actually not good. Before this I've played at least a dozen different 504 games and they've all been interesting. This was the first one I've played that clearly had some issues, mainly just that it went *much* too long in the face of players flailing with the objectives (games with Military really want to be fairly short). But even so, to me it was much more consistently interesting than Scythe. I'd actually rather play most of the "modern", more interesting Risk variants (Star Wars, Star Trek, Halo) than Scythe. Now in fairness, Scythe is really not intended to be a wargame - it's really a development game with a combat system bolted on that seems to have been designed to be as uninteresting as possible. If the game had any sense it would have stuck to its development theme instead tacking on a half-assed combat system. But it still has a lot of the same feel as a king-of-the-hill wargame.

Having said all this, I think Scythe is decent for what it is. If you like Feld games and 4X games, you'll probably find something here to like; it works, it's not terrible. I just find this sort of kitchen-sink design unappealing.

I really really like this game. I've played it 6 times in 2 weeks. Two of those games were solitaire style against the Automa, the other 4 have been with a group of 3-4 players. I think the game mechanics are really well thought out and designed to make the game balanced and fair for everyone. There is a bit of a learning curve for the strategy. Playing the game is actually surprisingly simple. Playing the game effectively and winning is more difficult. What I mean is each turn is very simple. You choose one action every turn and you pay the costs and reap the benefits. But choosing the right action and then choosing the right way to use that action to reap the maximum benefit is a matter of planning and knowing your opponents and can be challenging for some. There are tons of choices in Scythe and that's what I love the most about it. Everything from actions, to upgrades, to benefits, to encounters, to movement, to combat, is a choice. There is no other game that leaves so little to chance and so much to choice. So a turn is simple but knowing what to choose can be difficult. Very good strategy game that balances economy, power struggle, and popularity. If all you want is combat with random dice rolls than this isn't for you. But if you are looking for a game that brings together the many choices a real leader has to make in managing a military campaign, being popular with the people, infrastructure, recruitment, resources, upgrading equipment, and even politics then this does that better than any other game I have.

Another excellent game from Stonemaier Games! I splurged on the fancy components so the game looks fantastic with the large board, the realistic resources, the minis, and the overall artwork. I love the different asymmetrical factions and mixed player boards for tons of replayability. Definitely a game where multiple plays will be required to fine tune a winning strategy. I wanted to do everything the first time I played and quickly realized that it was not going to happen before someone puts down their 6th star. Looking forward to many more plays!

RATING: 7.6
Excellent 4x-style hybrid Euro/AT design. It leans the farthest towards Euro of any hybrid game I've played, clocking in closest to Eclipse I would say. Like Eclipse, managing your personal board is a huge part of the strategy as optimizing efficiency and synergy among your actions in combination with the developing situation on the map is the key to victory.

The choose-your-own-adventure encounter cards and randomized player board are the two spectacular elements here that stand out.

Also surprised how dramatic combat is with the combination of Dune/Kemet combat systems. Results can be swingy and brutal, although the outcome for the loser isn't too punishing since units just go back to base in this game (like Kemet).

The only thing I waffle on is the fact that the game provides incentive to avoid combat as you are penalized in popularity (a key VP metric) for attacking farmers. This is a large part of the game's identity and does pose interesting decision points ("Should I push that hex and risk the popularity loss to gain my much needed combat star?"), so it's not a huge issue. 

The setting is amazing and the art gorgeous, but the seams become visible at times when trying to justify mechs travelling through mines to warp about the board or not being able to cross water until you develop proper technology. These aren't deal breakers, just little things which may bother a hugely thematic gamer.

This feels very well designed and coherent for being such a sophisticated game. It's a treat to experience and does so many little things right. From the splendid tactile feel of placing cubes in little recessed player spaces, to pushing mechs across a map, Scythe is quite the game.

De los mejores juegos de mesa que he jugado. Tiene de todo: administración de recursos, control de territorios, manejo de cartas, objetivos ocultos, conflicto directo y, ¡un excelente tema bien adaptado en un juego de mesa! Los juegos del tipo 4X siempre me han parecido de los mejores, y esté me gusta aún más porque el combate no es tan agresivo como en otros juegos, haciendo a este juego un poco más "familiar". Como todo el mundo comenta, el arte del juego es muy bueno y las figuritas personalizadas para cada facción lo hacen ver aún mejor que juegos en los que sólo se usan cubitos para representar los elementos del juego.

Very fun game, however it is also very complicated.

The board and the faction/action mats make the board game flow easily and game play intuitive, once you know what the symbols mean and how to use them correctly. The board is incredibly well-thought through with each faction having clear advantages, disadvantages and strategies.

Strategy plays a massive part in every aspect of the game; from knowing what moves to take in the future to knowing how much power to wager in combat. It is by far the most strategic game I have ever played. 

My recommendation is to look up "how to play scythe" in youtube before playing or even reading the rule book. Once you know how to play the game and teach others to do so, it is a very rewarding and exciting game.

Scythe is buttery smooth and elegantly designed, turns go quickly so even 5 player games don't take too long to get back to you, the actions are meaningful and satisfying, and combat does not feel devastating when you lose, and so is encouraged when necessary. I enjoy it tremendously and am looking forward to playing it a lot more. Home run for Jamey Stegmaier and Stonemaier games!

The game appear complex, as do all games with many components. However, once you look past the cards, coins, meeples, different miniatures and more, the games mechanic are actually quite simple. 

The balance between this simple mechanics and the intricate utilization of the same mechanic is brilliant. Also the game is stunningly beautiful, wich is important to me personally.

The miniatures are good, but they really benefits from a coat of paint, as you can find ample examples of online. 

Great game, higly reccomended.

Very nice game. 4X Lite. Finishes in about 2.5 hours average. Gorgeous components (full disclosure: I got the Collector's Edition). Smooth rules and systems. I would also daresay replayability will be quite high since player mats and faction mats are randomised so that each time you play, it'll be different.

[EDIT: highest praise. My wife likes the game. She normally doesn't like complicated games... for her to like a 4X means Jamey hit it out of the park)

An engine building solitaire game with movement/combat on a shared map grafted on to it. It is a pretty nice combo and it works. The micro-turn concept works well to keep the downtime to a minimum at higher player counts. And I rather like that the way combat works makes war have consequences, and makes you want to hide behind your citizens to make it unpopular to attack. 

It is very well produced and fun to play. I like the encounters, the factory bonus, and the slightly different boards. Lots of nice little touches. I worry about balance in asymmetric games like this, but the differences seemed minor enough that it can't be that bad and there is enough interaction to help it self-balance.

The engine building puzzle is also interesting and seems like the player count will significantly effect how you go about things. And for this to play in 2 hours is impressive. As hot games go, I will take this miles before something like Terra Mystica or Eclipse.

lived up to my expectations. Easy to teach, can be quick, just an amazing all around game from one of the best publishers out there.

Edit 1/16/18: Bumped from 9.4 to 9.7 I was initially skeptical of all the hype surrounding this game, but it has honestly exceeded the hype for me after 22 plays. Attacking with the mechs may be more sparse than initially expected, but the tension created by the threat of attack is just as effective for area control and board manipulation. Wind gambit adds significantly to this tension. Love love love this game.

Another game that I think is overhyped. The engine optimization aspect is fine if a little dull; the passive-aggressive care-bear dudes-on-a-map-but-not-really game design aspect seems ridiculous to me. It's basically dudes-on-a-map for people who want to turtle and build their own little thing and not contend with anybody, I guess, which can be my thing in some games, but not for this. At least this plays pretty quick, even though it's got potential downtime issues with slow/AP players.

I can see why people love this game, but it’s not for me. It’s well-designed, gorgeous, and intricate. However, I’m completely over it and never want to play it again after the 4 times I’ve played it. It drags on, and I dislike how little luck is involved, and how other players can just stomp all over my little engine of growth. As an engine-building player, I like games where I can build up my own little economy, as I do with something like Terraforming Mars. I have strong negative feelings about this game - too many rules to keep track of, and too much area control/offensive strategy for me. As a more passive player, I hate how other players can ruin my little engine. I don’t dislike this as much as Mansions of Madness, and I can see how people enjoy it. But it’s not for me, and please don’t make me play it again!

This game is outstanding on many different levels.  There is a balance required between expansion, both on the map and on your board.  There is a requirement to adequately control your resources.  And there is the tremendous desire to play the game again, immediately after the last play, to try something new.  The mix of boards, factions, factory cards, achievements, and encounters all lend itself to multiple replays.

And the artwork is, without a doubt, the best in any game I have ever seen.  It is no surprise the Jamey created a game based on the art, and not the other way around.

I can't help but think this game is just so beautiful. I wanted to love it. I tried so hard to love it. Everything is full of bling, it should be right up my alley. Euro and conflict in one, on paper this game was exactly the right game for me. In reality though I found the combat tedious and boring, I found the euro aspect tedious and boring, and all I was left with was a beautiful game to look at and never want to play. Not a bad game. But not a good game either. I have actually written a full review on it.

I want to try this again, but I'm suspecting Scythe isn't going to be a game I fall in love with. It is an objectively fine game, but I found three issues that bothered me. First, with five players, there seemed to be a long time between turns (and I'd expect balance issues with less than five players). Second, I flipped through the objective cards, and there seemed to be some balance issues. Some of them seemed straightforward, others nearly impossible. And last, I felt, at least for my faction, that the game was exciting at first but fizzled towards the end. I was able to plan several turns in advance, and like in Euphoria, each turn gave me little progress towards a goal (despite having unlocked several upgrades). The combination of making little progress each turn, being able to plan so far in advance, and having a lot of time between turns was frustrating.

This game is proof to me my tastes in art and colors are outside of the mainstream.  When I look at Scythe I see a combination of bleak, dreary art evocative of Eastern Europe in the early 20th century (and always on a cloudy day) and bright primary colors (blue, red, yellow with no green).  I don't like either scheme, the combo is particularly unappealing.

Slightly overrated in my opinion. 

Scythe is a well-presented strategy game with reasonable game time, approximately 1-2 hours per game. The game comes with astonishing art and well-produced tokens & minis. Sadly I'm not a fan of its game mechanic: too few player interactions, predictable starting strategy and linear gaming experience. It's a decent game, perfect for those who want a casual game with little complexity, without spending a whole afternoon playing it.

Scythe is a game that scratches a lot of my gaming itches. Dudes on a map. slick action selection almost similar to a rondel. Quick turns, various tech options... it all runs very smoothly in a reasonable playing time.

Add to that some straight up fantastic artwork, excellent components and a unique theme, and I suspect this game as the potential to be a long-term keeper and possible favorite.

Update: first play with four players, and it just reinforces my appreciation of this game. Even better, all four of us really enjoyed the game, and it just goes to show that I think I'll be able to get this wonderful game to the table again and again.

I'm a happy Kickstarter backer :)

Update. Five plays now and I'm happy to see that every game has felt different. Scores have been in the 40s and in the 100s. The game has seen a bunch of combat and almsost no combat at all. Scores have been incredibly tight and lopsided.  It really boils down to the collective tendencies that the players bring to the table. My interest hasn't waned.

The game was playing into 2 phases strategically. In the first phase, players compete with Encounter tokens and factory action cards.  This phase is very intense.  Players are trying to fully utilize their resources effectively to unlock their Meches and get "lucky draw" from the enounter prize.  This is pretty cool.  But after all the encounter tokens have gone, the game goes into the second phase for which I can say it becomes a multi-solitaire game.  The character seems not to be very useful and all players like playing their own production in order to gain VP without or having limited interaction.  I'm quite disappointed about the game switching to such a multi-solitaire mode indeed.  It's quite heart break that the Scythe becomes such an anticlimax game!
Scythe 開局後基本可分兩個階段，第一階段是鬥快搶encounter bonus 和factory 的額外行動列, 雖然抽encounter bonus 都是幸運大抽獎, 總算是緊湊的競爭, 不公平是不太重要關鍵是鬥快捷和好玩。但到場上的encounter bonus 己搶盡, 遊戲變了斷層各自各做自己的追分。變成multi solitaire game.  遊戲變得虎頭蛇尾。有點失望。

Really enjoying this game--even playing PnP with still-under-development files. It seems like a big mish-mash of mechanics and scoring upon first look, but it all gels so well.

The more I play, the more I see the strategies open up. With the 5 factions and 5 player mats there are multiple combinations to explore, so each game is a bit different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great design which scales very well, allows a lot of freedom of strategy of winning and with a huge amount of replayability. For example since the options on the player mats are all slightly different and the combination of mats will be fairly unique every time you play there is not it seems a single best starting strategy and your opponents might do something very different to you and still be making the best moves for them. This difference is further reinforced with every faction having its own special abilities and upgrade powers for the mechs and character. Drawing of factory cards, events, secret objectives and building placement bonuses all add to this, as does the fact that there are a lot more possible ways to earn victory stars than it is possible to earn in a single game.

Fantastic that this game scales fairly well to up to 7 players with the expansion as it is often hard to find good boardgames for 5+ players that fit everyones playstyle.

The component quality and design is excellent and the artwork is outstanding.

There is a lot to this game and the only downsides is that the event cards are a missed opportunity to evoke a sense of adventure and theme (passing around the card to look at the artwork is too slow and people quickly lose interest in anything but the reward options). I'd suggest taking inspiration from Above and Below.

The complexity and amount of rules could be considered a negative, but the fact that the game starts slow-paced and early choices are less important than later, as well as the excellent advise and player reference cards for how to approach learning/teaching the rules makes this quite painless for the most part.

Great game that I never win, but I will always come back for more. Though there is a lot going on, at its core there is a simple framework from which rich choices and tactical/strategic maneuvering hang. The toughest choices are knowing when to spend money since those are points at the end of the game. This is a gorgeous tabletop experience stemming from the world building artist - Jakob Rozalski, and is an absolute must play!

This review is still pending a full play-through, but I enjoyed my single incomplete game. The asymetric teams are loads of fun, and I particularly appreciate the "Terra Mystica"-style player boards that let you upgrade by (re)moving wooden bits. Also great are the Choose Your Own Adventure-style encounter cards and the fabulous mech and player models. What holds me back from a higher score is simply that I'm not a huge area control game fan. Still, if I WAS going to play area control, I'd play this.

Also own Legendary Box, art book, 3x automa decks, Meeple Source wooden large action tokens, 19-piece encounter and expansion tokens, 12-piece fire encounter tokens, 15 metal $2 coins (Promo #10), 15 blue metal $10 coins (Promo #15), and seven metal $50 coins (Promo #9).

All that Scythe allow you to do is to manage your faction as any other game i ever see on the market. It's easy to gat through its mechanics and the rulebook help a lot in this. It's clearly explained and let the players "discover" the game step-by-step. The diffrent factions with different abilities and the "high-tensioned" interactions with the other players, gives you the sense of an immersive experience which is the target of the producer. Yes, we are in front of a "setted" eurogame, with an awesome rivisited history comes from the Great World War. You can feel the hard work of the producer to get it into play and implement that with the mechanichs. From your movement to the born of a new worker then the crafting of a big and strong MECH, your slowly get more power and influence on a big part of the east Europe. One last amazing thing is the possibility to play it in solo mode, with the "Automa" rules which are included in the core box. That mode add more components into game but allows you to play alone at home, when your friends can't join in. Everything about this game smell like a fresh wind and is so funny have a long night of gameplay on it. So, i advice this game to all the Euro-lovers but also to all of them who love a big game with a spectacular strategy! Like it so much!

RATING: 9
Cons:
- Takes a long time to teach to new players.
- Some bad decisions early on can be unrecoverable, feelsbadman.
- Inefficient play can feel bad, but is also the main motivator for improvement. If you can't overcome this feeling and understand how to improve, you're just left feeling bad.
- Game can end abruptly and feel unsatisfying.

Best Aspect:
What I like most about Scythe is the variability combined with clear restrictions and goals. 
Most games you are playing a faction/board combination you have not seen before which helps keep the game fresh. When starting the game with a new faction/board combination, you have some clear goals and restrictions placed before you. You are restricted by what hexes you start on and what the strengths of your faction are. Your board has some stronger actions and some weaker actions. Some bottom row actions are difficult to pull off for you and some are easier. 

This helps you think about the game systematically but also in small discrete sections. In fact most things about Scythe make you think this way. You need 2 oil to upgrade, and there are only so many ways to get that 2 oil. If you're set on upgrading, then you have to figure out which of those ways you will take. Unless you're playing red, you can't use the same action twice, so you're incentivized to think at least one turn in advance.

Scythe also has some clear strategies and ways to play that help you offload some of the difficult decision making. Performing a bottom row action is almost always good; plan out your turns to perform a bottom row action every time. Getting a star is good; build that last mech to get a star. Encouraging this kind of thinking helps lead to further strategic thinking. Planning moves in advance, producing only as much resources as needed, being as efficient as possible are all encouraged by the core design of Scythe. 


Other Notes:
- Great player board design. Once you've learned the basics of the game, the board is set up to help you remember what each action does in further sessions. It feels clever and presents information well. For example, moving a cube from the top to the bottom through upgrade clearly shows how a top row action improves and how a bottom row action becomes cheaper. Only Con here is that you might have to pick up the pieces frequently if you don't remember what you gain from removing a piece.
- A little something for everyone. Some area control, economy management, combat, etc. None of them are the sole focus of the game, however, so some may see this as a con. For me it enables a diverse set of players to enjoy the game. 
- Art is great. 

9 and not 10 because I imagine there are optimal strategies for each faction/board combination that can make the game boring or feel solved.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game, but I believe it is overhyped.
The artwork, large board and many playing pieces are great, and it was a lot of fun to try to get stars on the board through building buildings, performing upgrades etc.  However, for a game with heroic characters and war mechs, there was surprisingly little combat in our 5 player game and if anything even winning battles caused a net loss for the attacker.  So in the end, the actual game is a straightforward worker placement/resource farming game like so many others, except a bit crappier. In my opinion the warfare side needs to be made more central to the game.
An odd experience.

Update Jan 2017.  Have played 4 times now.  Played a 7 player game tonight, and with all the times I have played, the person who won was the one who camped in a corner and was lucky enough not to be attacked by other factions, usually as a result of geography and luck. I find that somewhat unfair.  It is still a fairly good game.

4 Plays so far, can't wait for more. One was basically a 2 two player learning tutorial. The three player game was absolutely great. I usually don't go this euro but I very much enjoyed these puzzle like mechanics, and particularly enjoyed trying to take top and bottom row actions on the same turn, deploying mechs and their special abilities, the factory cards, and encounters. Combat is fairly sparse and the system is very simple but it is impactful when it happens. Can't wait to play again. Can easily see this rating going up. Won my first real game on a 3 mech assault on the factory for the final move. 

Update, rating likely staying around 7. Definitely prefer the game with 4+ to encourage interaction. Would like to have a bit more, as this is about as euro as I can go it seems.

At its core an economic game with lots of fluffy stuff around it. Great UI and beautiful presentation combined with reasonable play time (4 newish players got through in 2 hours) is worth something.

I'm not a fan of Stegmaier games. So I really wasn't expecting to like this. And I didn't. But it was perhaps better than I expected, as my expectations were quite low. I simply do not ooh and ahh over the fancy bits, particularly in the souped up version that I played. The game play is ok. It's a pretty standard resource conversion game, similar to other Stegmaier games. But what really kills this game for me is the combat. You have one strength pool for your civ, and you choose how much of it you're going to burn in a blind bid with your opponent. As if that weren't bad enough, each player also has a hand of combat cards, which are also included in the blind bid. This is one of those games where you want to either win by just barely, or lose by a lot. Which comes down to bluffing and double think. Those who like that will love the combat in this game. It's simply not for me. Which is a shame, because the player tableau aspect seemed fairly reasonable. And I will say kudos on the production quality of the player boards. The indentations to keep the cubes in place works great.

Really enjoying my plays of this one so far. Lots of strategies to pursue, lots of interesting ways the two player boards interact, interesting decisions, and great player interaction. By far my favorite Stonemaier game. It is getting harder and harder to hit the table and just isn't as fun with 2 and too clunky with the Automa as a dummy player.

Far more of a euro economy game than I thought it would be, which isn't really my thing. Though it is the best euro I've played. Biggest complaint is the lack of interaction between players. I rarely even have an interest in what the other player is doing. Same problem as Suburbia.

I love this game. It has nice components and artwork. It's a game of economic engine building and area control which you can complete in around two hours. It's nice to have a game like this in my collection between the very short and simple games and monolithic monsters like Twilight Imperium 3ed.

The end of the game can come quite abruptly and you can win by just building things peacefully in your own corner. These can be negative qualities for some players and I admit them as minor flaws.

I'd like to get a better playthrough of this, as the one time I was able to play I happened to be sitting next to a guy who thought he was playing a wargame.  It's not a wargame, and so all he did was pretty much doom us both to last place =)  The random setup does seem to create some situations where a player can be at a major disadvantage, but overall, the mechanics are great, the components are fantastic, and the art and theme are just awesome.  If you like worker placement games with a minor territory control aspect, then you'll love this.

One of the best games I've played in quite some time. This really lets players decide their own paths forward, while they agonize over not being able to make all the moves they want to. While there is a combat element, it's not something you ever *have* to do, and all battles are resolved very quickly.

I like the shift in roles and starting resources, so each game will feel unique. The bits are all very nice and the art is spectacular. 

If I have any knocks against the game, it would be that there is a fair bit of downtime with the AP-prone, and the advertised playing time feels wildly off unless everyone is very experienced at it. Can't wait to play again, and will be looking to get my own copy soon.

First of all, this game has an outstanding artwork and the components are good; but you need more than that for a game to be great. After watching some reviews and reading comments, I knew Scythe was not what I was expecting; finally I got to play it.  It felt really dry, a rush to gaining the 6 stars, no tension (at least not in a 2p game), a mix of other game mechanics which don t really work that great together and an artificial end-game condition and scoring. I will give it a 1 just to balance the overhype of this and because this is not even a game for top 500.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Scythe was at least somewhat of a positive surprise for me, although it violates my general gaming preference #8 (see my profile) in that it is partly about singling out particular opponents to attack or maybe cooperate with, bringing with it the issue of kingmaking. So far it looks like the problem isn't too strong in this game because it doesn't emphasize actual combat that much (but, as has already been repeated often, it is much about the mere threat of combat). Moreover, the problem is partly compensated by the general charm that moving units on a map can have for me.
The main worry I have about the game is that different combinations of faction plus player mat turn out unbalanced, i. e. better combinations might turn out to be too much better than weaker ones. Particularly, at least at first and also second glance, it looks like it might be too unattractive to draw a player mat that has its 3- and 2-coin-actions for the resources that the starting peninsula of the faction doesn't have. Particularly with one of the 3 player mats on which the upgrade action costs 3 oil. Most particularly Polania with the Industrial mat. To not even speak of the overpowered Rusviet+Industrial because that has already been banned semi-officially. However, so far I am still mostly willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt that the (still allowed) faction-player mat combos are not too unbalanced.

Publisher: Stonemaier Games

Player Count: 4 (best)

Notes: 
Scythe is a good looking game with great components, at its heart it is an optimization euro with asymmetric play. It has borrowed a mix of mechanics from various games and it tries to be more than what it is. Game play amounts to no more than light player interaction - which is mostly for area control and combat if required. I found that the combat cards values were a bit to "swingy." Scythe rewards optimization, but ultimately it is a race game, and ends before you know it. You need to be aware of what is happening on the board and be prepared to play for end game from the start. A turn that is not optimized, is a wasted turn. The designer has said that it is a 4x game ... I struggle to see it to be one.

I love this engine-building Euro hybrid.  

There has been much debate about the "4x" name on the box, and I agree that Scythe doesn't really hit all 4 X's.  There isn't really any "Exterminate" because combat doesn't destroy your opponent's Mechs (or workers).  The loser in combat has to move their Mechs (and/or workers) back to their Faction's starting home base.  That's definitely a hindrance as far as the territory control goes for the combat loser, but it's far from an "Extermination".

However, what Scythe does exceptionally well is engine-building and territory control wrapped up in an immersive alternate 1920s Eastern European history with incredible artwork and beautiful game components.  And that's why I personally love this game.

The family constantly enjoys playing this. I'm very pleased with the game and the rating reflects on how I feel about how the game plays in my group. This is not the heaviest game out there at all, but a highly approachable Euro-style game that gets everyone to the table. There are more challenging games out there that I would enjoy more but don't get to play because they are too much for others in my group. With that in mind, I rate this game higher based on the ability to get to play it which in the end is the goal.

I'll only play this game if I'm in the mood. It's a slow-start end abruptly euro game with a small bit of combat that may or may not be exciting. The first few turns highly outweigh the next 70% of the game. There is a notable snowballing effect. Some factions are slightly unbalanced. 

The player mats are ingenious though, and the art is gorgeous with high quality components. It's also a relatively quick game for what it is, which is why it's strange that it feels slow - I never felt excited during games.

RATING: 5
The single most overrated game I have played. I just don't get it. "It's like Terra Mystica with mechs!", except the mechs don't go around trampling on everything and game play is not as good. It's just a thinly disguised euro-game.

The rule that you aren't supposed to calculate who is winning is stupid. It's supposed to avoid AP and make it easier for new players, but experienced players can tell who is winning without the AP and it just stops a skilled learner from performing well against them.

The initial objectives are unbalanced. Again they are supposed to make it easier for beginners to get started with the game, but it turns out the skill is knowing when to try and achieve your starting objective and when not to. The nature of beginners is that they will try to get their objective regardless as in a game with so many options it's something to cling onto. Then they get upset when by achieving it they've wasted all their turns going off on some sub-par strategy and the game has ended out of nowhere.

The plastic components are terrible. The wooden ones are quite nice though.

There is a warning built into the game. On the quick suggestion card for beginners it says something like "Don't try and do everything. Try and do FIVE or SIX things well".

I finally snagged a copy of this, catching a single copy as it was being delivered to a local store before it made to the shelf.

It's not that this is a bad game, but the strategies seem obvious and the gameplay and decision making was not compelling.  I've heard this billed as the next Terra Mystica, but ultimately, its not.  I've played Terra at least 40 times are there are strategies to that game I still don't understand.  The best actions in Scythe seemed obvious as soon as the rules were explained to me and I had no difficulty winning.  It is, admittedly, a nice solid civ-like game, but it just seems highly overrated.

Ended up cutting this.

Better with more players, as interaction can mess up what is otherwise a very linear optimization game.  At lower player counts, or with no interference, this is very much an "engine-building-for-engine-building's-sake" game.  

Near the end, you'll be doing things for the sake of doing things.  E.G. Enlisting recruits only to get the star, building a mech or two just for the star, etc.  It seems silly - building a mech should be something cool, but here I'm doing it for no real purpose, just for the star.

Fantastic artwork and great quality, well thought out components. The economic engine is good. However the gameplay just lacks the addictiveness of other games like Terra Mystica.

RATING: 10
So far, I am really enjoying Scythe!  I have to start off by saying that the artwork is absolutely amazing! (almost drool worthy!)  The artwork really helps the theme come through!  I love the encounter cards - which is probably the best part of the game!  It is fun to share the artwork around the table and then read the choices for each card.

Guess what? Not only is the artwork amazing, but the miniatures are too!  Some of the faction mechs are so cool looking!  I really like how the mechs have been designed to look as they might function.  For example, the white faction mechs can move onto lakes and dive under water and appear elsewhere on the board - these mechs have what look like a submarine cockpit.

Component quality is off the charts!  I love the wooden pieces too!  Every faction's workers are cut differently - and even these are shaped to go with their faction.

Finally, game play is fun!  The rulebook is easy to read and I didn't have a lot of trouble figuring out the rules.  There are a lot of moving parts in the game, so this game takes awhile to teach to new people.  Once players get going, the game starts to move nicely and there isn't much downtime - which is good.
On the negative, I found it challenging to remember some of the rules and make them clear to my friends.  River walking rules (and some others, I cannot think of at the moment) make the game feel a little clunky.  I think with more experience though, this problem will remedy itself.

So far, I really like this game and I am salivating to get it to the table for another play through!

Edit: The solo experience changes my score for this game to a 10! Now after playing Scythe solo, I love the game even more!  How awesome that I can enjoy Scythe by myself as well!  I didn’t feel like I was playing alone.  I could enjoy my individual play as usually experienced with human players because the solo variant is so well developed.

RATING: 10
This game is great.  Very well balance engine building game that rewards you for completing certain actions that really make the game great.  It starts slow with "what do I do first" question in mind but gets better and better each round as you start to unfold your strategy.  Numerous ways to earn points.  Unique player boards and powers gives plenty of replayability.  Combat is fun and challenging but only amounts to about 20% of the game and most near the end of or 3/4 the way through game.  Beautiful board and pieces.  One of my top 3 games.  As always your first play might only be 5-7/10 on rating scale but goes up each play after that once you learn the rules and strategies.  Even if you lose you're thinking about strategies and game play for next play.  A must have for any strategy board gamer.

Have played this quite a bit so far. At least 10 times. We play 2 player a lot but probably best at 4 (5 is fun if everyone knows what is going on, otherwise it can drag on explaining the rules over and over again). Art is fantastic, components are top notch, gameplay is great. I love the variability and different paths to victory. I have the expansions and picked up the metal coins and additional dials. Highly recommend getting a third party organizer. There are lots of pieces and setup can be cut down to a few minutes with an organizer. I went with the one from Daedalus and I love it.

The discourse around the game gets so wild and divisive and exhaustive that I'm not sure I can or should add anything to it. I'll just say this: I like puzzling out what the most efficient action is, I don't mind the fact that combat isn't more complex, I am constantly charmed by the encounter cards, and I have yet to find a path to victory that isn't viable if played right. It has its faults and shortcomings, sure--but, at the end of the day, I really, really like playing it.

And it is GORGEOUS.

RATING: 8
Enough has been already said about graphic design and quality of the components here. I won't add anything new. Scythe looks just gorgeous and it's a pleasure looking at all of this. There's definitely a reason why you pay so much for the box. Impressive.

I really like the world that is represented in Scythe. Blending hard-working farmers and yellow fields with huge mechs made of steel sounds overly weird in theory, yet it is extremely appealing to me. Here, mechs are more a tool created for purposes of transporting workers and carrying goods, not fightning. Combat appears, but is not that important. The threat of war is in the air, yet rarely those big machines use their powerful weapons. The question is, who will take the first step? Who will risk losing their popularity amongst the men of Eastern Europe only to gain control over some territories or resources?

Don't be misled, though. This IS a game of economy, resource management and engine building. One of many, you would say, but the aspect of area control, combat(honestly, how many euro games have it?), thematic encounters giving flavour and some spicy randomness(great, great art on these ones) and units you can actually move on the map makes Scythe distinguishable from other games from euro universe. This is a game that rarely brings something new or surprising. Instead, it combines a few great ideas already used in other games. The thing is that these mechanics are mixed in a really smooth and elegant way, allowing players to have a very pleasant experience while playing the game. One of the biggest advantages of Scythe is everything being clear, understandable and reasonable. Although there are plenty of rules, new player get them quickly and rarely have any questions. This is also thanks to the excellent action-selection mats that have very intuitive iconography. Having mentioned these, the idea of cubes, buildings and other wooden components that you can put in them is genius. Nothing will ever fall down due to the accidental hand move or something! Other games should have that done the same way(Terraforming Mars, I'm looking at you).

So is this perfect? No, by any means. Scythe is really solid mechanic-wise but not especially outstanding. None of the gameplay elements are jaw-dropping because you've seen all of these already. One of the fresh things is that resources always remain on the territories where they were produced. This simply means that if you don't spend them fast enough and you lose control over the territory where you've gathered them, well, you lose them as well. And your opponent gains them, which is even worse. This is an aspect that I like a lot, as it creates interaction between players. 

But is the matter of being not original or especially groundbreaking really an issue? Absolutely not! The combination of elegant rules, smooth gameplay with little downtime and constant action, beautiful graphics and great mix of euro and ameritrash mechanisms results in a game that you want to return to. This is an euro that doesn't look like an excel chart, involves player interaction(even combat!), territory control, randomized events... so if you're a fan of games that involve area control, assymetry, messing with other players and are strongly thematic, but you want it to be much more economic and less fighting/killing, well this is for you. Just don't think of it as a war game. I think this is a main reason why some people were dissapointed. Don't treat it as a 4X. It requires a different approach.

Very strong euro style game with many interesting elements: resource management, engine building, area control, etc.; the amount of combat is up to the players; the different ways to gain six stars is appealing to me; replayability is good; main criticism to the game is the lack of player interaction, but I think it has enough: competing for area control, keeping an eye on how far opponents are on the triumph track and keeping in mind at which taken action neighbors gain profits; limited luck factor; downtime is short; houserule: Rusviet should not get player mat no. 1 (Industrial) and should not be able to use it’s faction ability to place their player token on the factory card on sequential turns, otherwise the game will be too unbalanced.

1-5 players, asymmetrical 4x euro game, heavy weight, 120 minutes.

Rating based on 3 solo games and 3 plays with 3 and 4 players. I can perfectly understand the hype, which was primarily based on art work and theme, and as far as I;m concerned the game delivers on its promise. 

The different factions all have their own unique abilities which make for a different game each play, also combined with the random player board, which calls for a different strategy each play.

People looking for a heavy combat game will be dissapointed, as combat is minimal in the game, however the threat of combat is constant, which, in my view, works very well.

I've tried a few games against the AI on easy (Autometta) and normal (Automata) level and that's also a nice experience, which allows you experiment a bit with the combinations and strategies. COnsidering to acquire additional Automa packs in orde to play against mutiple AI's. Also might consider buying the expansion, which adds two new factions to the game.

My retail copy includes the expanded board and promo card #41. 

It's ok, but not really what I was looking for. It's a euro through and through, nicely produced with fabulous art--if it looked like other euros, no one would be talking about it. There is little real confrontation--you battle to get the points, not to dominate. The contrived board bugs me (symmetrically placed tunnels, dopey river crossing rules that make no sense) as does the very nature of a multiplayer 'war' game where everyone spends all their time staring down at their player boards trying to plan out which actions the game will let them take. 

I think there are lots of better euros, if that's what I'm looking for, and also many Ameritrash games that do this in a much more exciting way. It bugs me that so many people seem to love this game...I keep thinking that I need to play it more to figure out what I'm missing.

This is no doubt a good game, whatever the way you look to it. 
It has a great visual impact, though one also can think it is overproduced, a trend that has arrived with most recent games.
All the upgrades, the quest for resources, the power developments, the area conrol, etc, makes Scythe one of those games where a player always has something useful to do, regardless of his turn or situation on the board.
However, there is not much interaction (or that interaction can be avoided almost to its extreme) and an atacking player is often more penalized on atacking than the defending part.
Besides the natural assymetry between factions in a game like this, there is also the question that some initial starting grounds seem a bit unbanlanced.
Overall, in spite of beeing a good game, i think i would prefere to play a game like Blood Rage instead (for instance), since it has most of its elements and runs more swiftly, more fast and more fun (and it´s ultimately more cheap!)

First let's get this out of the way. Scythe is basically an overproduced euro...

And I LOVE IT!! 

This game is all about efficiency and posturing. With the threat of war. It has a very ominous vibe throughout the whole game. 

I think people see mechs and think that this is all about dudes on a map and combat. If you go in with that attitude you will be very disappointed. This game is about building an engine and managing resources. You need to try your best to figure out which 6 stars you will be going for and then go. It might very well be that combat and area control will be a path to your victory or it might be setting up an engine of pumping out tons of resources and avoiding all combat as much as possible.

As far as calling a game a 4x or not. I hate how people can get so riled up over terms. I don't care if it fits into that "box" or not. I think the game does an excellent job of giving you the feeling of a 4x game all within a shorter time. (a hour and a half) For me that's why I often prefer to play Scythe over those other games. 

It won't be very often that I could get a group together to play some epic 6+ hour epic game. So I play Scythe instead.

RATING: 8.5
Preliminary rating as I have yet to play a full game, but having played a few rounds to get the feel for it, I only expect this rating to go higher after getting a chance to finish a full game and a few more.  This is a 4x game, and the unique starting conditions along with the variable combinations possible should make the strategies not "locked in" depending on which combination you get.  I'm looking forward to playing this again, hopefully soon.

RATING: 6.5
Great ideas fatally flawed by lack a real publisher telling the designer to cut the bad ideas. Same problem with all of Stonemaier's games.

The combat system is overly simple and flat given he has the audacity to call it a "puzzle" and compare it with Kemet. Kemet, Dune, and Rex are the systems that this combat is based off of, but know what? They had variety of effects with their combat cards and different ways to screw your opponent over. This is just about numbers. No tricky way to outsmart an opponent as long as you use more of your combat value. And if you're the defender and try to get smart by using more power than your opponent predicts, guess what? You've just set yourself up for another attack, and whoever gets to attack you next gets a free Star. Combat needs a vast overhaul or gutted entirely from what would otherwise be an outstanding resource management game.

Then we have the encounter cards which show art and leave the story to you. Yeah, your options on the encounter cards are completely rediculous nonsense. If you wanted a "choose your own adventure" feel then get into it more! Look at what Above & Below or Near & Far have done. Again, trim the fat or actually bulk this up to par with the great economic side of the game.

Then we have lots of severe thematic disconnects from the game. Most annoyingly is how some factions only know how to swim across rivers to "villages or mountains," but forests or fields? Yeah, they don't know how to swim to those. Another faction does, but that faction is clueless on how to swim to a village.
I understand how tunnels are adjacent to one another, but how on earth does one faction have villages be adjacent to one another for movement? Another faction has lakes adjacent, even for waterways that aren't connected at all so "Dive" doesn't explain it. Did "The Factory" also make some fancy teleportation devices???

I just want to play the resource management part of this game, which is such an awesome idea. Too bad I can't play it without getting frustrated at its attempts to branch into combat & storytelling. And for the record, I love Ameritrash games, I'm not just a Euro fan complaining that some Ameritrash got mixed in with the game. What I want is the Ameritrash to be well done, or cut out completely. Don't half-ass it!

The production value of this game is a perfect 10. Because it is so beautiful and thematic, the gameplay can feel a bit like a letdown. Very fun engine building/action selection game. But too little exploring and player interaction for my liking. The last rounds do get tense and it is very well balanced.

Beautifully crafted game with cool components, cool theme, intuitive to play, intuitive upgrade mechanism, excellent game flow and much more streamline than other games in this genre

DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO BE AN EPIC AREA CONTROL GAME WITH A LOT OF FIGHT GOING ON BECAUSE YOU SEE THOSE COOL MECH ON THE COVER! This game is about engine optimization, resource management, with a little of area control and a few pinching your neighbors and take all of their stuff.

Best with 7 player for more combat opportunities if all players know how to play, otherwise recommended with 5 for less downtime

RATING: 10
Absolutely outstanding production quality-- amazing pieces and gorgeous artwork. Very smooth gameplay with depth of strategy, ingenious mechanics, and a robust scoring system. It has a faintly steampunk vibe in terms of the gadgetry and war machines.

This game has quite a few novel game mechanics that are hard to describe easily. They need to be experienced to really understand how they fit together to form a "big picture" of gamepley. The game is slightly asynchronous, with each faction having a slightly different start area with randomly diversified actions (the player mats have slightly different actions on each, and are not tied to the factions) making it possible to have many different possible start combinations for huge replayability. 

The mechs, and the movement and combat mechanics make this a very interesting blend of war game and area control. With "combat power as a resource" it's easy to maintain enough of a strong front to discourage players from attacking you, and you cannot simply build all your mechs to have military dominance. More mechs means more area control, but mechs contribute relatively little to combat themselves, beyond directly enabling it. Sending multiple mechs to attack a lone character only really makes a difference if you are otherwise close in terms of combat potential.

The game end is triggered in a slightly different manner than most games. There is not a predetermined singular objective, nor is there a fixed number of rounds. Instead, there are 10 possible objectives, and once a player completes 6 of them, the game immediately ends. This means players are encouraged to try to specialize and focus their empire on some of the possible goals, Each goal offers perks along the way regardless, for example, one of the ten goals is "to deploy all 4 mechs". Obviously deploying your mechs is inherently good, regardless of if you're trying to accomplish that goal. Every player almost *needs* at least one mech to improve their overall mobility.

Mobility is one of the most important aspects of the game. Scythe is a very *dynamic* game, you almost never entrench anywhere, or set up shop, or build a base, etc. Your mechs and your workers are the meat and bones of your operation. There are "structures" but they mostly offer minor passive bonuses and cannot be destroyed or moved, so they require very little investment to defend once placed. The map itself is initially restricted by rivers, your character will be restricted to 3 hexes of land near your starting base. In order to leave this area of land, you'll have to either construct a mech that adds mobility features, or build the mine structure to unlock access to the game's tunnel network. To add a 4X feel to it, there are "encounters" on the map, which are roughly similar to "ancient ruins" from Sid Meier's "Civilisation". These encounters present the characters with a few simple options that award various prizes. Which faction, player mat, starting objectives, and initial encounter you draw completely shape how you play the game.

Resource management is also done differently in Scythe than in most games. Resources don't go into a "player supply" area off the board. If you pump oil out of the ground, it's now sitting in barrels next to the oil rig that produced it. If a player takes control over your oil rig because you couldn't defend it, they get to keep the oil that's there. Workers produce the resources, and they can also move it. So you could have a Mecha and accompanying worker travelling the land, producing what is needed then moving on. Leaving lone workers unprotected is unadvised near the center of the board, as roaming enemy mechs and characters might find them easy pickings for some easy resources. Conveniently, though, resources can be spent from any hex you control, so metal from the far mine on the board can be used to deploy a mech in a different area. Essentially, you don't have to worry about schlepping goods around and setting up supply chains. Resources are also unique in that each resource corresponds to one and only one purpose. Oil is for upgrading your actions to be more efficient, metal is for deploying mechs, wood is used for building structures, and food is used to gain "enlistment" bonuses that add an interesting dynamics to the seating order and action economy.

When you "enlist", you simply choose one of the four production actions, "build", "upgrade", "deploy", or "enlist". When the players to your immediate left or right at the table take the selected action, you gain a small bonus. This is slightly counter-intuitive as the word "enlist" seems to imply you get more people, or soldiers, or something, but "enlisting" simply derives benefits from other players actions in the future.

One of the smoothest things about Scythe is the way actions are taken. Essentially each player has 4 regions on their player mat that they can choose from. There is a top-row action, and a bottom-row action on each section. The bottom row actions are the ones I mentioned previously, "build", "upgrade", "deploy", and "enlist". The top row actions are the more fundamental "move", "produce", "bolster", and "trade" which allow the manoeuvring of pieces, production of resources, gathering of combat strength, and acquiring otherwise unavailable resources or popularity (respectively). The unique thing about the player mats, is that the exact costs and rewards of the bottom-row actions are slightly different across the player mats. For example, the "agricultural" and the "industrial" mats have different oil costs for upgrading action efficiency, and different mats award different coin/point bonuses for performing different bottom-row actions. This gives each player a slight bias towards which end game goals they should be pursuing to maximize their score. Additionally, the player mats group the top and bottom row actions in different combinations. Some players have "upgrade" on the "move" section, while others have it under a different section. The reason these regions matter, is that each turn you select a different region to perform the actions of. You cannot keep moving repeatedly, you have to alternate with a different region each time.

Each faction also has unique perks. For example, one faction actually allows the player to take the same action over and over, whereas others allow workers to move across rivers without the aid of mechas. 

All in all Scythe is a fantastic board game with amazing quality components and compelling gameplay. I'd be happy to take it off the shelf any time. 10/10

The only drawback is the complexity. This game isn't for the faint of heart, and I would only recommend this game to avid board gamers. It took close to 90min to explain the rules to my family and some rules confused them to the end. The game is quite tricky if you're used to the likes of monopoly, risk, or snakes and ladders.

One play in, playing with someone's game that was completely decked out with all of the Kickstarter goodies. Absolutely beautiful game, with great looking components. But what about the gameplay?

It's decent. You get some variation with the different factions, and they in turn draw random action selection cards each game, so no two games should be quite the same. The area control aspect, with resources stored in specific tiles rather than in the usual generic pool of stuff, results in some military tension that most euros lack. There's combat, yes, but it's not a path to victory by itself since it typically costs you popularity and that can cost you the game in the end.

This is not a wargame, so if you were looking for something like [i]Eclipse[/i] with a different theme then you're going to be disappointed. I also think that there's not going to be a huge amount of variation between games owing to limited movement and actions to select from, especially in those early turns. My instincts tell me that it'll be good for a dozen plays or so before I hit that been-there-done-that feeling. Still, that's not bad.

So, a game I probably won't be picking up myself, but one where I'm happy to play someone else's copy from time to time.

Update: Another game in, another victory. This time in a 7p expansion game. Even though I won, I don't really feel like my decisions were especially profound, which doesn't say much for the gameplay. Also, I wouldn't play 7p again as there's too much downtime, and no real catchup mechanism for players who get beat on early. Plus, those objectives cards can vary pretty wildly in difficulty, which isn't fun if you're one of the people that got a tough one.

The more I think about it, the less enamored I am with this game. If I'm going to play an action selection game where board state really matters, I'm always going to pick [i]Dominant Species[/i] over this. It has a much richer narrative with much more difficult decisions. Seriously, try to recount a game of Scythe a week later and talk about what happened. I'll bet you can't say much beyond, "I performed some actions and got some points. Dave attacked me once", or some such.

This is all based on my opinion.  I've played Scythe around 20 times so far.

While Scythe is not necessarily the "best" in every category - that is to say: 
it's not the most thematic (i'd argue this as Scythe is likely ONE of the best)
it's not the most strategic
it's not the most war like
it's not the best area of control/influence
it's not the best euro
it's not the best american/non-euro
it's not the best at most things... BUT..

It IS GOOD/GREAT at all of those.  In every category that this game qualifies for, it's good/great.  Not a lot of games can say that.  Most games are great at a couple things...but lack in others.  Not the case for Scythe.  It's insane to pack so much in a game.  It reminds me of the first time I played Terra Mystica or Twilight Imperium 3.  It was such a surprise to find a board game that encapsulated so many different wonderful things (that make board games great) at once.

Scythe is HIGHLY replayable. Extremely engrossing.  Easy to teach/understand.  It's just a little more complex than Catan - so if you're looking for a good introductory game for people that are on the fence on more advanced board games, I'd recommend Scythe with any of the other "intro games."  However it can also be extremely complex if you play with the right group of people.

I don't think I need to say anything about the art or the theme of the game.  It's clear ahead of nearly anything else in recent memory.  

Due to the above reasons, I'm ranking this game as "Outstanding"  10/10 "I will always enjoy playing."

I still don't completely know what to think about Scythe. I like that it's going for that balance of Euro with a little more "dudes on the map" interaction, but I'm not sure it quite pulls it off. The game is beautiful, but I feel like the board is a little busy in its design. 

The metal coins are outstanding. And more games should learn from Scythe with its inset player boards to keep cubes in place. The upgrade mechanic is ingenious, where you get the choose not only the upgrade, but then where that cube goes for a further discount in your bottom-row actions.

While there's a ton of choices in the game, it's about maximizing the engine for only a few things. You can't do it all, and there's a bit of a puzzle aspect to it.

The theme is there, but you tend to get so bogged down in the mechanics that it can get lost. Explaining the game for the first time can be a bear, but once people get it, it gets moving.

In the end, it's fun, but not exciting. I'm not super interested in what the others are doing until they're on my doorstep or at the very end of the game. There's no tension of, "please, please pick that option" or "what will they do?" other than battles, which happen less than you think.

I think Scthye is trying to be a little of everything and because of that falls short in a few areas.

Stegmaier is the best producer in the board game industry. The art, components, graphic design and continuity of aesthetic in Scythe are unparalleled. Unfortunately as a designer, his philosophy seems to be that the question of balance won't come up if you utterly bury it in content.

And he's right. Many gamers these days largely do not care if their session was decided at setup as long as they can blame the imbalance on luck, [i]as if random setups that cause runaway leaders are not the designers fault[/i].

TLDR: Although gorgeous, Scythe is not a good game.

brilliant take on the eurogame genre with an interesting mix of different elements that makes for a very tactical game. I think those that claim the game lacks interaction don't know what they are talking about and were probably expecting a different game/genre. I do feel like you need to play with at least 3 players to really experience the interaction which is subtle but also brutal. The game leaves very little room for mistakes and miscalculations.

Scythe is a game where i was both looking forward to and still a bit 'scared'. I don't like brutal games with direct conflict and as the games was presented as a war game with mechs and fighting i was very sceptical. It couldn't have surprised me more. You can perfectly win the game without a single attack and you can make it as cruel as you want.

I have to say, this is a very beautiful game, visually speaking.  The game itself is a pretty quick play as well, for a strategic game as it is.  The part that took me a while to grasp is that the combat plays very different.  The mechanic itself is fine, but how many troops you have somewhere doesn't mean the same.

The other thing to note is that you can win in many different ways.  If someone is running the board, controlling it, it doesn't ensure their victory.  You could stay in your own little corner of the board and still do pretty well for yourself.

Amazing gameplay. I got spanked, and hard, in my first three player game, but can't wait to play again.

Won by a fair margin on my second three player game. Felt like the game was over very quickly, but it was just shy of two hours (115 minutes?). Really like how smooth this is. A little chunky at first, but it all gets rolling pretty well. 

Lots more plays to come.

Stunning game visually (at least the KS edition with extra everything). The game itself is fun, more building than fighting, almost a puzzle game trying to get your actions to chain up as efficiently as possible. Plays much faster than anticipated, less than 2 hours with 4 players.

Will gladly play again.

Not a fan of 4x game but this one isn't too bad.  Combat isn't so overwhelming...no need to turtle or prompt others to attack people.  That said, there are better economic engine games out there.  Also, there doesn't appear to be a lot of variability in this one.  The map is always static.  Sure the nations can get mirrored up with different tech boards.  But the nations start the same place on the map every game.   It wouldn't surprise me to see an expansion with tiles so that the map can be modified for variation.

An "everything but the kitchen sink" sort of design, which is really just a bunch of euro mechanisms dumped on top of the old 1997 game Throneworld. 

No better than Twilight Imperium, Eclipse, or the dozens of similar ones. The battles are mercifully quicker, but movement is opaque and the other bizarro restrictions do make explaining/learning a chore, one not worth the payoff.

RATING: 5
Solid but somewhat overhyped game.

Update
# Moved down 1 Star.  The game is repetitive and all games virtually feel the same.

What bugs me most is the fact that the them does not come through even once. The heroes do not feel like heroes and the different factions also don't make much of a difference.

In the end I would always prefer a round of Eclipse over Scythe any time. SOLD!

What's most interesting about Scythe is the clever way Mr. Stegmaier is marketing his products: Starting the buzz almost a year before the Kickstarter launch...emotionalizing a dry constructed gameplay with miniatures and great artwork...being such a supportive guy for this community...

RATING: 3
This game is in no way balanced. Certain factions can attack other factions without fear of reprisal because of the riverwalk mechanic. Certain faction's powers or mech abilities are DRAMATICALLY better than others. And it is FAR too easy for a single player to bully another player and completely take them out of the game with literally no chance of that bullied player coming back into the game ever.

In short, this game LOOKS amazing, but is easily one of the least balanced asymmetric games I've ever played.

The game's Automa is, however, brilliant, and saves this game from being a 1 star game. I'd like to rate it higher based solely on the Automa solo mode, but yeah, that's a bad idea when people might be buying the game with the main purpose of playing with friends.

As a final note, this is avaliable on Tabletop Simulator. I WOULD recommend the purchase there as it is MUCH cheaper than the physical version, you may find you like the MP fine and don't mind the horribly unbalanced gameplay (or don't mind house ruling around it), and, at the very least, can play the Automa version there with some nice automated setup. Especially since the expansion was added recently for free, it's certainly worth the 5 or 10 bucks they're asking for the digital version.

Viticulture + Tuscany has become a favorite for my wife and me, so am interested in anything new from Stonemaier.  However, it's also not a sure bet.  After a breif infatuation with Euphoria, I found it to be ultimately unsatisfying.

I have watched some playthroughs and read the rules for Sythe.  I can certainly see several influenes blended into this game: Terra Mystica, Kemet, and Jamey's own designs.  I also see shades of 51st State, even though that is not mentioned as inspiration. 

I am sure the production will be stellar, but I'm not seeing anything in the gameplay that attracts me.  It reminds me most of Terra Mysitca, but not as good, and I ultimately didn't care that much for TM.  It just seems rather dry and procedural, an impression that was only reinforced by Jamey's run through.  I enjoy resource conversion games, but this one seems like an overblown way to do it.  I think I will pass on this one for purchase, but would like to play it sometime.  If it holds up well in the ratings once the shine wears off I'll take another look.

A very Euroey Ameritrash game (I say this not as a bad thing).  The play is very Euro style, the score and the end is very swingy and very last player takes that type of finish.  Complex with simple movements.  Multiple paths to the end and you feel engaged during the whole game, with fast turns the down time is not bad for a large game.

Amazing art/theme, and a very compelling development game. One of my favorite aspects of Scythe is how combat is handled in the game. It has a very "cold war" feel, where the threat of combat has a far larger turn by turn impact than the actual fights themselves.

Very tightly balanced as well, with multiple avenues towards success.

Engine building efficiency race with the potential for board interaction. It’s similar to Terra Mystica with its player boards, player powers, hex map, upgrading of engines, blocking, and game weight. It’s different in that it allows direct conflict, stealing of resources, and movement of units. The game rewards familiarity; people who have played more will definitely beat new players, so it's not ideal for a crowd with mixed experience.

I really cannot understand the hype. I mean, I do like the game, but is it a masterpiece? 

Yes the production quality is excellent, the game mechanics flow well and the game is enjoyable to play. But it didn’t strike me as something that good to justify a Top 10 rank on BGG. Clearly a lot of people think it is very very good indeed. 

Perhaps the miniatures and the conflict within the game has brought a bunch of non-Euro playing Ameritrashers into playing the game? I can understand that, by those standards, the game will feel and play very differently to what people are used to and so could feel like a new concept in gaming. But as a Euro-only gamer I didn’t feel that.

I like Scythe, don’t get me wrong. I really enjoyed my play and would happily play it again. But I just didn’t think that it was out-there amazing, and perhaps my expectations had been built up too high?

Scythe is the whole package. Great theme: post WWI where where unique sci-fi technology has been discovered and utilized. Great mechanics: variable player powers, action-selection, area control and worker placement/resource management. Great rule book that is easy to follow. High quality components: the minis look and feel awesome, the cards are of good stock, and the meeples are all unique for each character. This is the type of game where the designer fine tuned the tiniest of details to make the experience that much richer. It has a ton of replayability because there are so many different combinations of player mats and action mats. Strong, in-depth strategy. The only reason I couldn't give it a 10 is because it requires more time than my group can commit on a regular basis.

The solo game is good, a step above the Viticulture Solo experience (which is also good). 

The complaints of player boards strongly steering you towards a strategy are pretty accurate, but for me that doesn't bother me. Not all games have to be sandboxes. This is mostly a euro with just a hint of battle. The game does nothing new and exciting, but it recycles other ideas and throws a lot together in a relatively quick and concise package.

Id say its a great entry to longer 4X, Action Selection or Engine Building games. Games range from roughly 60 minutes to 150 minutes depending on count and experience. Expect play time to be drastically reduced with experienced players.

Scythe has a bit of an identity problem.  When you get it moving, you realize that you're playing a cross-section of a bunch of other games that you have already played; it has a little bit of engine building, a little bit of 4X, and a little bit of skirmishing, yet in the end, while it does each little bit decently enough, it never seems to land in a spot where all of it clicks together.  There's nothing wrong with taking from other designs, mind you, and the mish-mash that ends up on the table actually isn't too bad.  A little overproduced, perhaps, but nevertheless a decent if not stellar design.

Keep in mind that I had no expectations walking into this, so none of this is peppered with bias; the only thing I knew about it was that the cover art was fantastic.  When you strip away hype and cult of the new, what you're left with is a game that plays at a pretty fast clip.  Our game had 4 players and would have clocked in under an hour, but we're a pretty social bunch so there was a lot of talking instead of playing, but even then, it was over pretty quickly.  Each player had a random faction and a random action board, which I found pretty interesting.  The asymmetry of the action boards means that what you're dealt is ultimately going to determine your best strategy, something I duly ignored in favor of getting mechs out onto the table (I came in about 20 points behind 1st and 2nd players).  I'm not so sure I like the idea of having that decision made for me, but it seemed to work out okay.  The only caveat is that your starting position, therefore, can seriously hamper what you ought to be doing as determined by the actions you can take.

Players aim to walk away from the table as the richest player by the time any one player accomplishes six achievements.  Obviously, this means having the coin in your hand, but there is also end-game scoring determined by your accomplished achievements, left-over resources, and how many hexes you control - how much you earn from each of these depends on how much you invest in gaining popularity with the people of ... wherever this takes place.  The whole end-game trigger is the weirdest thing in this game and seems kind of pointless to chase unless you are the points leader.  Why bother when someone else can do the work for you?  You don't want to ignore it completely, mind you, since it is one of the key points in final scoring, but mechanically, this system kind of clashes with the rest of the game.  When a player completes one of several achievements, they get a star.  When any one player gets six, the game ends.  In and of itself, a star does nothing except bring the game to a close and only then is it worth points.  In a game that is about getting a good engine going so you can reap the rewards, a star that provides no such reward seemed a little left-field to me.  The best illustration of this is the objective cards - each player will start with two and can accomplish one, but the only reason to spend time and/or resources doing this is to get a single star.  That's it.  No benefit whatsoever.  At a high level, it doesn't break the game or even make it worse - it was just so counter-intuitive.

The map, then, is laid out pretty well provided you have a full compliment of players.  Your start position (determined by your faction) is so terribly important because of what you might hope to accomplish when you look at your action board because your neighboring hexes in your isolated island only provide a specific combo of resources - got a board that takes advantage of wood, but your nearest source is across an early-game impassable river?  Welp, good luck to you.  However, with under the full compliment of players, you have a good chance (as we did) that some players will have a distinct advantage in being unopposed while expanding.  I think a small provision here to lock off an area of the board for fewer players would greatly benefit the game and increase the tension.  Otherwise, the art is delicious if somewhat too earth-toney at times, but there's just so much beautiful painting all over this game.  

It's a shame, then, that the interesting theme isn't really present in the gameplay.  At least I didn't feel it was expressed that well and the game is ultimately a very mechanical experience.  It's not quite a Euro, though, but it isn't quite 4X either.  This is what I mean by identity problem.  Your engine and action selection screams Spiel de Jahres mainstays, but your map exploration and combat are something more akin to Fantasy Flight (in particular, I was reminded loosely of Dune/Rex on that front).  And all through it, the very unique and fascinating theme doesn't really come out in the mechanics.  It tries, of course, but it's a little too gamey for it.  Not really a deal-breaker, but it is a missed opportunity.

TL;DR - Scythe is an overproduced quick, fun game with terrific artwork, but it's not really going to knock your socks off.  It will be popular for a few months, perhaps, but it doesn't seem to have the staying power of its inspirations.  It's definitely decently designed, but it could have been so much more had it just focused a little bit instead of trying to kitchen-sink the whole deal.  Definitely try, but only maybe buy.

Most elegant civ game.  Streamlined and quick yet thinky for the time frame.  Player turns are quick and the game paces very well.  You got your euro in my 4x though.  Not much here is new or innovative.  Besides the punishing of combat mechanism..

Played it two times so far, but kept thinking about the game for a long time after the game was finished - what I could have done better etc. Love the artwork and the overall theme. Really enjoy the mechanics. The only minor thing I don't like is that for certain factions there are strategies that you must follow in order to win/succeed. However, you still need to know how to play.

A mixed bag, but overall I didn't care for it much.  I hate "chicken combat", and even if combat is usually rare until the end of the game, it's still something you have to worry about and protect yourself against the whole game.  The action system is ok.  Don't care for the slow-paced minis-movement.  Also, I just don't like the art.

A tactical miniatures game mixed with Terra Mystica with a pinch of Agricola.  Yes, please.  It shouldn't play as smoothly as it does.  Easy to jump into and teach.

Spew Forth and Watch You're Empire Grow

The rich artwork and theme integration make most, if not all, of my other games seem pale in comparison.  The only other game I know that has felt this rich is Viticulture.  Stonemaier games is doing something with their game aesthetics that I don't think anyone else has caught up to yet.  Brilliant stuff.

I've found the fluidity of the game to be both intriguing and odd.  In most of the more complex games I've played there's usually a round structure or something that stops gameplay while some sort of general game maintenance occurs.  In Scythe you start and then you end once that sixth star is placed. 

There are no rounds, ages, new things that become available, or resource spots that need refilled as the game progresses.  Once you start you just go until the game ends, and because you're only using one of four action spaces each turn, the game feels really smooth, but also extremely repetitive.  You're just bouncing back and forth between four action spaces do the same things over and over and over and over, and yes that's what games are, but most have something built into the game to break up the monotony like rounds or upkeep.  You and the other players are just thrown onto the map with some boards and bits and take it one action at a time until the game ends.  There are no hand resets, no chit refills, no running out of actions.  There aren't any in-game upkeeps, and I feel like that's some sort of design achievement for a game with so much in it, but again, it feels odd because that's just not what I'm used to.    

Perhaps, partially stemming from that, the game has a feeling that there's a lot going on, but there isn't much to it.  There are a lot of rules to go over, there are several types of resources,  three tracks on the board to move your pieces around, different types of units all with their own movement rules, four decks of cards, a map loaded with icons that isn't free to roam around until you unlock certain things; you have two boards in front of you with all sorts of wooden bits, symbols, and text.  A ton of stuff!

But the game is actually kind of easy to teach, despite all the stuff.  The game plays extremely smooth thanks to great iconography, taking one action at a time, and no in game upkeeps to worry about.  So you see all this stuff and listen to all the rules and your brain is like, "wwwaaaaaa," but then you start playing and your like oh this is pretty easy, but it looks like it should be hard, but it's pretty easy, why isn't it hard, is this all there is to the game despite there being a ton of stuff in front of me?  And then the game ends because someone placed their sixth star and you're like, "oh I guess it's over.  I don't know how I felt about that.  It wasn't unpleasant.  But was it pleasant?"  

And that's kind of where I'm at with Scythe.  You start the game with three units on the board and pretty much try to unload all your wooden and plastic bits from your player boards onto the main board.  It's not unpleasant, but I don't know if it's pleasant and I think it's because there are some subtle innovations working under the hood of this game that are tricking my board game senses into wanting to not like it just because the smoothness of it seems to be at odds with the one ton of game that sits scattered on the table in front of me.  I'm expecting something heavy, but it doesn't feel heavy.  I'm expecting my brain to short circuit from playing this game, but it never happens.   Scythe defies my assumptions and expectations of it, leaving me somewhat bewildered.

The truth is I probably overthought the whole thing.  Which is what happens when I write.  I think I was hoping for a game that had more tension and drama, but what I got was repetitive micro turns, a multiplier track, an odd end game scoring bonus for building placement, and some encounter cards that all feel like they do the same thing.  

A few reviews and comments say, "This is not the best game ever."  My personal feelings aside, I don't see why this game couldn't be.  The mechanics are solid.  The balance feels tight.  How the systems of the game function and interlock is intriguing.  And again, the theme and artwork are awesome!  Even though it lacks the special sauce for me, it has all the right ingredients of several other top ranked games, so I guess time will tell.

Still figuring it out so this may change, but after 3 plays I love the opportunity for great tactical decision-making and thinking on your feet.  Seems well-balanced and well-thought out.

Did not live up to the hype for me. Perhaps with more play throughs, it would pull me in more, but it seems a bit too easy to get cornered and be forced to sit on your hands for far too long to be a lot of fun. Once you get everything in place to really get lots of actions in, it's fun, but not as action packed as I had hoped.

RATING: 8
My initial thoughts, after only playing three times, are overwhelmingly positive.

The game plays incredibly smoothly, despite the rules dump needed at the beginning of a game for new players. The replay value feels huge thanks to the variability of the faction/action mat combos plus all the different, and very valid, strategy paths. The component quality and art are of the highest I've seen. The only other game with comparable quality I've come across is The Gallerist (and possibly Viticulture w/ Tuscany--no surprise there).

The game also doesn't over stay its welcome. First games with new players will be a little slow, but experienced players will know what to do to get those early game engines running quickly. I'd say the playing time is quite accurate for experienced players.

The only real negative thing I can come up with is the larger board with the extension takes up a tad too much real estate. Luckily it really is a non-issue as you can just use the smaller side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2016-09-23 : First play of this well-designed engine builder with really great components. The player board layout is the crown piece of the design, the only thing I'm a bit concerned about is that given a set of starter boards and your starting board position there may be a single most optimal way to play, given you little choice and harming replay-ability. But those are concerns for subsequent plays. Also, while definitely a fine game, it's not what the hype made of it - not by a long shot. A solid 8 for now.
2017-02-25 : 3 games in and with 3 wins with 3 different factions using 3 different paths to victory I can say with some assurance that while the player boards give you some help/direction in choosing your strategy, you're not locked into one and it all depends on what the other players are doing. Not so pleased with the board graphics and layout choices as some, so it remains a solid 8
2017-02-28 : 4 games in and the game feels played out with nothing new to discover- time to let it rest for a year.

I've enjoyed my 2 plays of Scythe and think it's a really solid game. With that said, I don't think it does resource management as well as games like Caverna or T'zolkin and I don't think it does combat as good as games as Kemet or Blood Rage. I do enjoy the main action selection mechanism and the7 available factions will provide a lot of replayability. Very great production and solid gameplay, but hasn't hit quite as a high note with me as others.

Absolutely gorgeous! Beyond that, this is an interesting euro game with limited conflict. There is a lot to like in Scythe of my one play experience and the few videos I've watched. I've tempered my enthusiasm due to a few niggly things that I'm worried about in the long-term with the game:

-6 stars and it's over, with potentially no equal turns. I know this is 'somewhat balanced through the player boards.'

-Not sure about the balance of the factions.

-I don't like the revisions/iterations Stonemaier makes with Viticulture, and to a lesser degree, Euphoria due to various issues. Scythe seems better, but only time will tell.

I have only played this once, so take anything I say with a grain of salt. My choice of euro with restrained combat is The Golden Ages.

There seems to be a trend these days for very splashy big box games with "wow" factor (lush artwork, fun theme, or fantastic figures). These games always seem to jump to the top of the rating ladder, yet I feel they do so without a ton of substance. Their look definitely hooks in the Ameritrash players, but games like Scythe also dangle an element of a strategy to lure in the Euro players like myself. I stepped up to bat and gave it a swing and hit one to make it to first, but it was no homerun.

Now don't get me wrong, I've long since preached that games ought to have high production levels, or at the very least have a professional look, but this is not a great game worthy of the BGG top 10 in my opinion. It works in several ways: quick players turns, good cause and effect (your choices directly affect the game), fantastic flavor, visual appeal, and I enjoyed how it improved the "Eclipse" mechanic of removing cubes to unlock powers and added an additional element of unlocking extra abilities based on where they are moved to. I did not however enjoy the wonky battle mechanic (it felt like something from a Fantasy Flight game) or the flimsy resource management.

I'm not sure how to put it, but I felt like I was playing a GI Joe toy battle at recess with pasted on rules and a lot of "boom, crash, bam" noises from everyone's mouth. The big fighty mechs don't really do much battlin' and your hero kinda just wanders about looking for lost choose-your-own-adventure pages.

It works, but it really is firmly on the Ameritrash side of things.... no Euro game would allow for such a weighted turn order.

I like the engine building in this game, but I'm not sure if the factions are perfectly balanced. Also, playing the game is mostly fiddling back and forth on my personal player board and there's quite weak player interaction. It's possible to play solitaire on one corner of the board over the entire game if no one is interested to attack you. I won one game this way. I usually tend to avoid conflict, so I think it's positive that there are many other ways to victory. After all, there is not much combat in this game, usually fighting part begins at the very end of the game.

However, most of the player interaction is that you follow what the other players are doing on the map board and try to react on their moves, and to get to some places before the others. Also, it's necessary to pay attention on your neighbours’ actions, as some of their actions could benefit you if you have used the enlist action. 

After being that critical, I still would like to play this game more as I think there are still many interesting things going on in this game. Also, the game components are gorgeous – especially the miniatures, I would like to paint them. I would not be surprised if I happened to buy this game some day, I think it’s possible that this game gets better with more plays.

Interesting game with some innovative mechanisms, but did not grab my imagination. Drab color scheme not pleasing to my eye.  Action selections seemed stingy and limiting; game proceeds at a slow pace.  Game discourages player interaction by punishing winners in combat almost as much as losers. An acceptable game that I would play again if asked, but I probably wouldn't suggest it. Three player introductory game took 3 hours even though two players had watched a tutorial video beforehand playing.

This might have been good if it weren't so horrifically slow. Two of us had played before, and two (including me) were new to it. Many times I knew what my next turn would be, but I had to wait several minutes before it got around to my turn again to do it. I was bored to tears.

RATING: 7
From a design perspective there is not much to critisize. The different clans seem balanced, and provide each player with a unique strategy, and the same can be said for the action boards.  However, from a gameplay perspective some of aspects fall a bit short. For instance, the early game is incredibly limiting, and players fall into scripted openings. And though I enjoy the star-based end game trigger, it appears that a few are more or less mandatory. Completing secret objectives, and winning a battle, are much easier to accomplish than maxing out the power or popularity tracks. All together, the decision space appears to be bigger than it really is. The biggest win here, surprisingly to me, is the world building. The premise and setting alone will likely lure me into several more plays.

Awesome euro-ish 4X game, with a truly remarkable "Automa" AI/solitaire system.

It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as “The Factory”, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.

Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.

Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction’s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).

Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player’s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are “encounter” cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.

Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.

Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.

I thought I'd like Scythe more than I actually did. The theme doesn't really come through and the player interaction is less engaging than in, say, Terra Mystica. Scythe feels more like an efficiency race with some area control and combat for [endgame] stars. All in all, it disappoints me for much the same reasons as Antike.

RATING: 8.5
A really fun mashup of euro style action selection and area control with an almost ameritrash feel. I always enjoy asymmetrical factions in a game if they are balanced well, and Scythe takes it to a new level with the mashup of faction and action boards - allowing each combination to push you in a slightly different direction. 

Component quality is off the charts, the player mats look amazing and are very high quality thick cardboard in two layers that holds pieces in place. The minis are stunning and look good even unpainted. Art for the game is phenomenal and really creates an immersive world that I really hope is explored more. 

The game can slightly suffer if everyone is not on the same skill level, as some of the important aspects do not make themselves immediately obvious but if all players understand the game it makes for some very tense play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The components are spectacular.  The game has plenty of variation, with different factions and player mats, structure bonus tiles, (secret) objective cards, encounter cards, and factory cards.  This makes for a lot of variation, and will change the way your strategy plays for each game.  The larger sized game board is ABSOLUTELY LUXURIOUS.  The game seems initially complex, but once you actually start playing the game is straight forward.  The only problem my gaming partner and I have had is that combat seems undervalued.  In fact, I found there were times when I wanted him to attack me so he would take the popularity hit when my workers when back to my home base.  I can't wait to play the Automata (solo) variation.  I think this will be one of the great games of 2016.

Richard & Sam own this. Brilliant game. I've played 6 times and it has always felt like a very different experience. The ability to finish the game is important - even if you have to lose a battle to trigger someone else finishing the game. Also, spreading out when you know the game will finish soon is usually very beneficial. 

The iconography can take quite some time to work out. I recently learnt that Enlist also gives you the benefit when you take that bottom action.

I played the expansion as the Japanese and really enjoyed not being landlocked at the beginning of the game. Traps were fun too.

Enjoyed playing this with group of 7 (expansion), and though I lost hard, I would want to play again. First game with 7 is impossible since it’s easy to get trapped early. As a newb, I finally had an idea of what I ought to be striving for past the halfway mark, but by that time, had gotten wedged in and was unable to do anything useful for the remaining third of the game, except pretend I was playing the start of the game over again. 

Downtime is a killer with 7, though, so I’d be more inclined to play 3- or 4-player game.

EDIT 1: bought my own copy (Collector’s Edition, no less) and have been playing solo with Automa. Set up is involved, but I’ve played worse (looking at you Trickerion), and looking forward to trying Scythekick app to help with that, as well as to handle the Automa — I constantly forget to move the round forward with the Automa.

Solo play has helped me with getting a handle on the action mat and how to optimize that, something I was unable to do well while playing 2-6 other people.

Now looking to getting Invaders From Afar and Wind Gambit expansions to try.

RATING: 9
For me as a traditional euro gamer, it's the absolutely right amount of interaction and combat together with a strategic engine mechanic. Combat is punishing, but not devastating. The theme is fantastic and the mechanics are clever and were made to fit the theme astonishing well at the same time. There are a lot rules, but as they are very logic and most of the time theme fitting, newer players can learn them in not too much time.

Very cool action selection mechanics, with a focus on building your board efficiency. I'm not a fan of the combat, but it seems like a relatively minimal part of the game.

The game makes little sense-- it feels like someone just kept adding unrelated rules and features until it played well. Not very satisfying.

RATING: 7
I’m conflicted on how I feel about this game. I find some parts of it really clever and then other parts much less so. The action selection system is the highlight, and I find it fun to try and become more and more efficient with my actions while racing to the Factory to get a bonus card. The problem is that the 2/3 of the game is mostly solitaire planning on your board with little to no regard for the other players. 

Only when players get to about four stars and start looking to combat each other for those last two do things start to get tense. And the combat is not nearly as interesting as its inspiration from Dune. There are no funky combat cards that can create surprises here; it’s all just numbers. And after you spend your power on a battle, you're now a vulnerable target to someone else (which is an intentional design choice). It feels flat.

It may be a lot to ask, but I wish the game had some other form of player interaction besides heavy-handed combat because I just don’t find it nearly as clever as the other aspects of the game. The cognitive load of having to track what powers players have and where their pawn is on their board makes it nigh impossible to anticipate what other players are about to do. Frankly, the whole combat aspect feels bolted on to create some player interaction.

So on one hand, you have this personal player board where have total control to plan out what actions you like to take, and then on the other there’s this chaotic colosseum where you hope people don’t notice you as much as others. 

I’ll never love this game, but I can see myself playing it 3-4 times to get my fill of the action efficiency experience and perhaps steal a win (update: I did just that). This comment sounds more of a downer than I intended it, it's just that I think the design is imbalanced.

RATING: 5
The artwork is amazing.  The production values are solid.  There's certainly a lot of stuff you get in the box.

I do like the fact that resources remain on the board and are fair game if left unprotected.

That said, there isn't one thing that this game does particularly well.  The economic game isn't as good as other options.  The "story" is oddly slapped on lipstick.  The combat is meh.  The asymmetry isn't really that interesting.

This game definitely could have used a lot less things and more refinement of some core concepts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After one 2-player game, I can say that I like it and that it is fascinating. Whether it holds up will depend on how interactive it is at the 3-5 player counts. I hope that I will be forced to pay attention to what other people are doing in order to play well.

Played 3 times. A moderately interesting puzzle, but just not that fun. Low interaction and analysis paralysis for days (minutes). Gorgeous art and components, but at the end of the day, it still feels like a dry euro. So if that's your thing...

Best game of 2016! Gives me the same feeling as the game that started it all for me. Catan. But this one is less luck and much more strategy! Beautiful artwork with detailled mechs en characters. The game has a vibe that you don't forget. This is the best game in my collection! From the battle system to the resource management. Everything is how it has to be!
*Edit after 6 plays: still gives me the same feeling: Still love it, and very balanced. Worth the 10!

Includes:
* Scythe - Invaders from Afar
I slightly lower my evaluation of Invaders from Afar (from 9 to 8) due to the fact that it doesn't really add up too much to the game itself. Yes, you play two more factions (one of which is my thematically favourite one) but the game itself doesn't really change (no new general mechanics, resources, card types, win conditions...), which a bit lacking for an expansion in my view.

Still, a definite buy for everyone who appreciates Scythe!

Nice mix of resource allocation, map exploration, and limited battle (just to add some focus to some of the resource allocation).  A bit like Eclipse in that the game naturally evolves from building your own little corner to encountering other players. Beautiful game in its art work, playing pieces, and  iconography.

The presentation and style are both excellent. I enjoy the FTL-style missions and the flavor/asymmetry of the factions. However, building an engine isn't my cup of tea. If the game had more depth to combat I think I would enjoy it a lot more.

The game is very well produced (but I do know of better produced games, such as Cthulhu Wars, so it is not in the top numbers). I like the slots for everything and how the game leads you in, well, everything. It has very attractive theme (although you hardly notice it during the actual play - I don't feel like enlisting new recruits, I feel like moving a cylinder to get some bonuses) and looks great. I also enjoy how fast it plays (at 5 with rules explanation in 130 min? nice!) and the heaviness of it.

Another one that we stumbled through our first game of it and immediately wanted to play it again.  It's baffling at first how complicated it looks, but it's a lot simpler once you get the icons down.  Probably going to hit the table a LOT.

Update: We l-o-v-e this game. A ton of fun, great strategy, and I feel like we've reached a place where we understand the deeper mechanics of the game a lot more. For a game this heavy, our group loves to bring this out.

Full thoughts at https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/60633/ejms-best-games-2016

TL;DR version:  the combination of a Cold War style "threat of conflict" with a super solid resource management and optimization game makes for an outstanding experience for a person like me who bridges the gap between Euro and Ameritrash gamer.  Add in one of the best tactile user interface designs in all of board gaming, amazing components and art, and fantastic worldbuilding, and Scythe was GOTY for 2016 by a landslide.

RATING: 5
One play with 6 players. We sped up play with simultaneous turn taking so play length wasn't too bad. A lot of levers to consider and I like the variable player factions. I can see how the game might be given new life with new factions and possibly new maps (crying out for an app version). Ultimately I don't know if I'm particularly jazzed about it in anyway...I mean, I've seen all these things before. What this has going for it primarily is wonderful art and a cohesive steampunk(ish) aesthetic. Not compelled to own it but I'll definitely give it a few more plays.

It certainly is not really the 4X game it seems to advertise being and whilst there are combat mechanics this is much more euro than anything else with an interesting, engine building mechanic at its core.

The initially very limited movement leads to a rather slow build up of forces, and indeed in our game we never actually made it into combat with one another. 
There are plenty of options on what to aim your engine towards and various categories which you can 'score' a star in. Once a player reaches 6 stars the game ends and points are scored based upon how popular you are with your people. This is an interesting mechanic as the more land you grab to score with them more unpopular you become within your faction (especially if you keep stomping on other players taking their territory). Having a large stockpile of goods scores many points at the end of the game but your popularity takes a hit everytime you force your people to work your fields. 

Random factions coupled with random player boards, adds a lot of seemingly different play options, however I am a bit unsure how differently this would actually play each time.

Los componentes, tanto las minis como sobre todo las ilustraciones, son increíbles; ahí va más de la mitad del precio. Después es un euro muy bien montado, ágil, rápido, fácil de pillar... Creo que lo mejor que tiene es que, aunque parezca que tiene un despliegue brutal, se pilla muy fácilmente y los turnos son muy rápidos y diferentes (en cada turno tienes que elegir un bloque de acciones entre cuatro bloques posibles, y eso te fuerza un poco a que cada ronda hagas cosas diferentes). Juegazo, y el modo solitario funciona muy bien.

After the first few plays, I have fallen in love with Scythe! It is elegant and intricate in every way. I am so excited to play this game more. There is so much room to improve upon your own strategy and there seems to be no best strategy. Beautifully balanced and alot of variety between turns and games. The world of Scythe is grandiose and its spectacle is unique and engaging. I would be satisfied just reading and admiring the encounter cards and all the gorgeous and dynamic artwork in this game! Definitely the most beautiful piece of art, disguised as a board game, that I own! I look forward to future plays!

I rated the game an 8 originally, but the expansions increased it to a nine for me.

Overall, pretty good, but I wish I liked it more.

There is a lot to like with the artwork, the engine building, the mechs, etc.  We played with 3 which felt a little wide open in the middle.  Everyone wanted to play again, although they said that in spots it didn't feel like the theme was as rich, like with the player mats.  But I felt you got a lot of game for the time commitment, only 2 hours for our game where everyone was new.

A good resource management, action selection, game with minis.

Played again with 5, 4 humans and the Automa bot.  Much better than with 3 as there was a lot less open space.  I'd recommend higher player counts of 4 or 5.

You definitely have to work towards the synergies your player mat and your starting resources create.  Use what you can produce and trade for what you can't.  Aim to build a mech on your 2nd or 3rd turn (it can be done if you trade).  I would go for the Speed mech simply so that you can move a bit more, and use the Mine to get access to the tunnels.

Always make sure that you are gaining coins, as that's VP.  In my last game, I rarely took actions that gave me extra coins and at the end of the game, 2 other players already had 25 coins or so each before starting to add the end game scoring.

I like Viticulture EE by the same designer more.

Where to start with this amazing 4X game! Thematic alternate history of the 1920's set in Eastern Europa, asymmetric factions with mechs, worker placement, area control, and combat (although not as frequent), with multiple ways to victory and differing strategy. The artwork is amazing in this game and looks absolutely beautiful. You get really immersed in the game from just the look and feel of the game. The components of the game are made with great quality and the Mechs look really sweet! The variety of setup that players can have adds to the replayability of the game and changes the way you approach the game and the strategy to use for each new game. The player board makes the game flow well and makes the choices very intuitive for the players and makes tracking the upgrades and actions easy and understandable. The game felt very overwhelming at first when learning how to play the game but becomes very easy after playing a few rounds. There does not seem to be that much player interaction and the bribing mechanic is very trivial and I do not see any purpose of it since players do not have to honor it. Despite this, you will have to pay attention to what the other players are doing and try to disrupt their plans at opportune moments and adjust your strategy according to what others are doing. The engine building aspect of the game is done very well and it is shown very clearly on the board game in an understandable manner. The different paths in the game and the asymmetric player board adds a very deep strategical element to the game, where you are trying figure out the most optimal strategy and efficiency while paying attention to what is happening on the game board. There are complaints of the game where it becomes to feel the same as the game is based on being efficient and the lack of combat and player interactions can make the game stale. I can see how it may end up to that point after a few playthroughs but at that point for me, the game would have been worth paying for. My game groups loved this game and one of them really wanted to play another right after we finished our very first game of Scythe. Although in the first game I was the last place and got destroyed, I was very happy and excited to play my very first game and craving to play the next time where I will be able to make better decisions and have a better grasp of the game. I am looking forward to the expansions for the game and for multiple plays of the game in the future! Easy board game recommendation and this game really deserve the hype and rating that it gets.

Scythe is such an achievement in board game design! It's impossible to miss how much passion and attention to detail went into creating this; with its gorgeous art, captivating setting, interesting mechanics, and rock-solid euro-style gameplay. I must say, however, that with this game I realized that euros are not my favorite type: while attempting to optimize your turns to build your engine as fast as possible--and having to consider numerous aspects simultaneously--is a very interesting and strategic mental exercise, I missed the higher level of tension that other, more confrontational games offer. That being said, for those who like engine-building/worker-placement/area-control strategy games with an awesome theme, I don't think they get any better than this.

Yes there was a lot of hype but the game lives up to it. 
It's an absolutely stunning production, which you can't be indifferent to. Plus the game is actually phenomenal. The turns are simple, the rules are easy to grasp (amazing iconography helps), engine building mixed with combat and area majority.  What is there not to like?!

Splendide; clairement le plus beau jeu auquel j'ai joué. Extremememnt complet. A voir sur le moyen terme si c'est asez varié et ouvert. Danger de partie qui explose en vol. A deux les cartes ont trop d'impact. A plus il est possible que les cartes 2 soient trop handicapantes. Le systeme de combat est vraiment pas pafait mais l'expérience de jeu demeure très bonne.

La fin de partie est souvent décevante; il faut la modifier de manière impéative.

On a fait un 1er test avec les cartes de combat alternatives; ça marche plutot bien mais c'est Wordy.

Absolutely astonishing and beautiful and I don't even like eurogames (!).

Played it with 3 and 5 players. With 5 players 3 were new to the game so it actually took 5 hours. But it was good fun all up until the very last minute and we played with people that aren't even gamers. 

Only down part is, as with a lot of games where you spend eons of time building stuff up and collecting resources, when somebody sweeps in (especially later in the game) conquers you in battle and you lose all the stuff you wasted 3 rounds getting....you kinda wanna quit. You don't see the point anymore because winning is now gonna be very hard. For some people that's fine, but if you're a sore loser like me then it sucks. But, hey, it IS also the name of the game! So nothing wrong with the balance or mechanics or anything. The battle part is actually very good and fun :)  

Tots wants this amazing game!

A komponensek gyönyörűek, a kivitelezés csodaszép. Egyedül talán a minik minősége nem 100%-os, de az is igaz, hogy nagyon magasan van már ezen a fronton a léc manapság. Nem kell megijedni azért ezek is 90%-osak. :)
A szabály elsőre soknak tűnik, de elég gyorsan összeállnak az akciók. Önmagukban, mert hogy összefüggéseiben átlássuk a játékot, ahhoz biztos kell 3-4 party. Szerencsére maga a játékmenet elég egyszerű, mert csak körbe-körbe akciózunk, nincsenek fázisok, nincs játék közbeni setupolás, adminisztráció, semmi. Egy kör is egyszerűnek tűnik elsőre: két akciónk van csak, egy felső és egy alsó.. Még így is vannak egész hosszúra nyúló körök, szóval nagyon jó, hogy ezt ilyen egyszerűre vették. Még elsőre is lement kicsivel, több, mint 2 óra alatt, szóval a dobozra írt játékidő reálisnak tűnik,
Érzések: kifejezetten jó játéknak tűnik, rengeteg újrajátszhatósággal, rengeteg felfedezni valóval. Csak minden mat megismeréséhez elég sokat kell játszani vele, és akkor még nem beszéltünk az építési bónuszok és a factory cardok által adott változatosságról. 

Jók az elemi lépések, mert ha pörgőssé nem is teszik a játékmenetet, de legalább tolerálható szinten tartják a holtidőt. Mondjuk ötösben azért elég nagy elszántság kéne ahhoz, hogy nekiüljek. 

A csatától nem annyira kell tartani, mert tényleg nem vészes mennyiségű, bár ez azért függ a játékosok vérmérsékletétől is. Nálunk három fővel összesen 5 csata volt, de nem agresszorkodtuk szét agyunkat első játékra. A harcot elég egyszerűre vették, viszont így kicsit semmilyen lett. Gondolom kockásat nem akartak, így maradt a kártyás+ nyersanyagelköltős változat, ami eléggé hasonlít a blood rage csatájára. 

Az első játék viszont fárasztóbb volt, mint amire számítottam, nem tudtam volna egy újabb partyt lejátszani. Nekem már megterhelően hevi kategóriába esett a játék, és az ilyenek nehezen kerülnek elő, még ha alapvetően jó játékok is. Ez persze még változhat a rutin a megszerzésével, csak kicsit csapdahelyzetet teremt. :)

4-5 játék után már nem érzem megterhelőnek, ami igen jó pont. Kiinduló szettek kiegyensúlyozottságáról azonban messze nem vagyok meggyőződve, de jó móka mindent végigpróbálhatni, és agyalni rajta, hogy hogy lehet belőle kihozni a maximumot.

After 1 play this gets a strong rating based on the gameplay, but I'm still concerned about a few things.  I'm not yet convinced this is well balanced, and the end game trigger can be brutally unfair to those later in turn order.

Fun game. Took awhile to figure out how to get it setup and understand all of the different levels of rules. But once we got going, it was a fast paced game that everyone in our 4-person group enjoyed. Looking forward to playing again to work out the strategy aspects of the game.

Scythe is an engine-building game that mostly concerns itself with action efficiency questions. There is an interesting action selection system (unless you are the Rosviet Union) but players spend the largest part of the game brooding over their own player boards while the only interaction point is the limited combat (which I generally am a fan of) that is most likely to occur when fighting for the final few VPs.
The end game seems a bit unbalanced but quite frankly, I find the game much too long for such a solitary efficiency exercise, so I'm kind of happy when it finally grinds to an abrupt halt.

Die 20er Jahre-Oktoberrevolution-Ästhetik gemixt mit Star Wars Retro Futurista, die durch überstilisierte, goldene Weizenfelder stapfen, ist grandios. Solch Crossover ist genau mein Ding. Die zielsichere Verortung im Pop hat mich auch schon bei EUPHORIA begeistert. Eine ideologische Färbung hinter den Fraktionen, die in einem Post-Weltkrieg-Szenario durch die Gegend streifen, kann ich nicht erkennen. SCYTHE lebt vonm intensiven Flavor und von dem atmosphärischen und materiellen Wohlstand. Es macht einfach Spaß sich mit seinen Mechs und Zeugs durch der Welt der Mad Max Bolschewisten zu bewegen. Spielerisch ist SCYTHE ein Wettrennspiel als weiterentwickeltes EUPHORIA: Hallo liebe Sterne! So ist das Tun von Dingen gegen Ende nicht mehr einem Spielinhalt gewidmet, sondern nur noch dafür da Sterne loszukriegen. Und das Freischalt-Tableau ist auch keine neue Erfindung, aber eine haptisch-visuelle Schönheit. SCYTHE ist eine sinnliche Abenteuerwelt, das sich seiner Effekthascherei nicht schämt. Wenn Pop es gelingt, sich selbst mit Spiel zu füllen, das es sich auch inhaltlich begründen lässt, dann darf es in meinem Regal auch gerne Platz für zwei einnehmen, die meinetwegen innovativer daherkommen, aber dafür mit weniger Möbeldesign. Man hätte SCYTHE auch als STYLE verkaufen können.

Finally got a chance to play this. Viticulture is one of my all time favorite games, this one has a similar vibe, only not as fun...in my very humble opinion. The player boards I found to be confusing and not intuitive. The battles seemed tacked on. I loved the encounters, but wished there was more of them. Eeeh, I feel like I am being pretty critical...but, as one of the hottest games of last year, I was expecting my socks to be knocked off...they wernt. I will say that it is gorgeous. The minis are fantastic...quality is amazing...I liked it, didnt love it.

Really well designed game. Fantastic artwork and superb connection of all these so many different actions that you can take throughout the game. By that I mean that after the first play everything seems to fall into place like and work together like pieces in a machine, and there is nothing that feels disjointed (like the priest track on TM, for example). Additionally, I think that -if well explained- how to win the game is rather clear as all your work and improvements gets translated into money at the end according to a very clear table on the board.
I also love how the direct combat has been integrated in this game without resulting into being too confrontational, and it is not terribly bad if you loose a fight.
It is a masterpiece. But I have to admit I spent the first rounds of the game thinking about a good excuse to leave the table it was totally overwhelming at first, and mid-game it seems it is never going to end. But after game, you realize that yes, the game will end and it can be understood, eventually all clicks into place beautifully. The word for it would not be complex, but an elaborated game both in terms of production and playing style.

WON IN 401 GAMES BLACK FRIDAY GIVE-AWAY CONTEST, 2016!!!

I like it! I was a little surprised at what a plainly-fashioned Euro it is once you look through the chrome. But the parts work well together as a whole. I was a little nervous about playing it 5-player the first time, but turns moved through quickly.  There's some fiddly stuff going on here and there, but nothing overly frustrating.  After two plays I think I'd like it better with 4 players. I continue to feel motivated to play it again and attempt to do better. I'm unsure at this point how many plays it would take before I was tired of - what is essentially - a resource acquisition and player board upgrade game.  There is a lot I find interesting in Scythe, but I think there are one or two other games that do better what this game also seeks to achieve. Still, it's a beautiful game to look at, definitely feels distinct among other "Euro/Ameritrash" hybrids, and it doesn't get boring.

RATING: 9
Great game that lives up to the hype, with quite quick and easy play and plenty of replayability. One of the best games I have played. 

Positives:
Quick turns
4 action spaces with actions that get better as you play
Deterministic combat (and combat a really small part of the game)
Cool components
Variable factions, that are very different to play. 
Great combination of systems with popularity track and military track that went up and down according to actions. 

Negatives (really trying to find any): 
Use workers to deter opponents from attacking...not really intuitive. I hesitate to leave a worker on his own, but taking the tile leads to no battle (that can give VP) and minus to the very important popularity. 
In the end picking stars and VP is all it is about and trying to improve your civ is not the best action (or in some cases not useful at all), just go for the stars. 
First player is great to be and you get nothing for beeing last. I was first and ended the game and therefore got to do more turns than everyone else. 
Resources are needed in great quantity to do things, so you need many workers there and once you are done the resources from that spot are useless, they give VP but just lay there...a bit unsatisfying. 
Feels like alternating between produce and upgrade should clearly be the best strategy. But if that is possible depend on the faction you are and the board you get. If it is possible for you, you have a great chance of winning. 
Too much space on the board. Fighting for space is not needed, so battles are mostly to interrupt someone and to get stars for winning battles. Would be great if it was useful in the game to win battles also.
Too much importance of being the player that end the game. 
Randomness from misson draw and exploration cards can impact the game too much. 
Draw one combat card before battle can decide the winner of the game. More randomness that each does not decide the game would have been better. 

Still a great game after 4 plays with huge variation between games. Some games end before you want them to, one game with 3p only took 50min but what a game. So many interesting choices and so much progress during the game. Love it.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
Enjoyed this Euro "4x" game.  I would say this game is more about resource management and utilizing your player board/special abilities more than anything. The opening is a bit solitaire, everyone is isolated until they get certain upgrades to let them move out

The interesting thing for me in this game is the massive amount of scoring options in this game. Almost everything will get you an objective star but popularity is important to make each of those worth more points. Also there is territory control and when to end the game

My only negative was the timing of when the game ends because the first player in our game got 1 extra turn more than everyone else, which was the difference. But we also may have played the turn order wrong with which starting boards we had

Played once with experienced players.  I won with the Yellow Faction and it seemed too easy - the choices were too limited and the amount of tension just wasn't that great.  Combat happens, but the consequences are trivial enough that it seems like not big deal if you lose.  The tech tree (building mechs and upgrading) provides a small amount of differentiation, but not enough to feel like it is very significant.  Most of the time you have one decision every few turns that is significant, and it is typically binary - then it plays out in sequence for a turn or two, and then you have another.  I pretty much did what I wanted with very little or no significant interference.   It just lacked tension and excitement.

RATING: 9
4X games have had a hard time hitting my table because my wife just hates building an empire with the thought that someone could just come and ruin it all in a turn. In that kind of games, there is definitely a fine line between exciting tension and frustration, which also depends a lot about the personality of the players around the table. 

For instance, Game of Thrones The board Game unapologetically encourages conflicts, fights and low-blows as it believes players do seek interactions. To us, this is too aggressive. 

Archipelago focuses on Euro type of indirect interactions with a race to deplete resources or secure the best opportunities on the markets. For us, this is just too un-exciting.

Twilight Imperium believes players do seek positive interactions as well, and therefore offers alternative types of interactions, like trading, politics, etc.

Scythe tries another alternative: Cold-War type of tension. Each player has this army of mechs and temptation to use them to attack the other players is high. But the winner is likely to be the one who is firm albeit popular (both with the virtual farming community and with the other players). Because rewards for combats are just not worth the effort. The smartest players will have an army to ascertain their power but do not strike first.

And disappointingly, this tension is the only type of interaction between players in the game, as Scythe at its core is an economic engine builder, and most of the action happens on the individual player mats. The engine is fun to build and well balanced but nowhere as fine-tuned as an Agricola or a Dominion.

So we've added some interaction as an house-rule. When a player is supposed to pick an encounter card and read it for him/herself, we instead have another player do it and describe the picture with the different decisions (but does not give away the benefits) for the initial player to choose from. Inspired by Dead Of Winter or Time Stories, I guess.
It helps with immersion and player interaction, but I appreciate that it affects the balance somehow as it makes encounters less impactful.

We have only played the game as a 2-player where player interaction is at its lowest, but overall, I can see that beyond the outstanding art, the game is good and elegant. To me, It isn't the best design ever, but it is enough to make me want to play it again and again, with more players, maybe. But those players would have to be selected carefully to avoid ruining everyone else's experience.

First play was with four players.  I got the sixth star (no one else had more than 4), yet I still lost $81 to $59.  Getting more popularity proved to be really hard in our game.  It was quite a lot of fun, despite there being less interaction than I expected.  Excited to try this one again soon.

First solo attempt, against the easiest level, I lost 64-39.  I was worried the game wouldn't be tight enough with just 2, but having the other faction right next to mine made it tough.

Second solo on Autometta level was a win 84-56.  Having the starting faction farther away made a huge difference.

RATING: 9
Well... I wanted to play it a few times before I rated it, and I can safely say, that I really enjoy this game.

More importantly, my Fiancee really enjoys it! :D

There are a lot of choices to make, and it's a bit of a puzzle without being Terra Mystica level brain burning - this is important since, although it's a euro at its heart, there is combat and encounters and a little bit of that ameritrash swing.

After the first play games typically run 1.5 hours in my experience and yet they always feel epic and end while the game is still fun.  In fact, that is one of the better aspects of the game that I haven't seen a lot of discussion on: you can't/ won't do everything in a game, and neither will your opponents, which means that as you try to anticipate your opponents and outmaneuver or outwit them you can make mistakes, costly mistakes in a game that is all about efficiency.

Let me say that again, this game is all about making efficient moves.  It's really addictive that way - and I love when you are forced to make a less than optimal move because, well, you aren't ready to take that bottom row action but you really need to move your mechs or your opponent can literally walk into your territory and take all your resources.

There is something almost chess-like about think turns ahead for yourself, and also trying to anticipate your opponents.

But this IS NOT a multiplayer solitaire as some have said.  I don't know where they are getting that from...  There a number of interactions between players, let me count the ways:

Combat, not that often, really, and yet some games has a lot of it.  This is because once someone starts a fight, it tends to lead to new fights as your opponents spend precious power and make themselves vulnerable.  But as it has been stated (repeatedly, although for good reason) the threat of combat is as important as really combat.  No really!  For the exact reason I highlighted above.  Maybe you don't really want to invade your neighbor, but you put your mech next to his unguarded territory precisely so he has to take a less than efficient action!

You will race each other for the encounters, which as the swingyest and most ameritrashy part of the game and really, really add a lot to the constant fun and replayabilitiy of this game.  I love that these encounters alone counteract the possibility of dominant strategies making the game feel stale because the player who adapts based on the fortune of these cards will beat the player that is fixed on doing his/her own thing.

There is also an action called "enlist" that allows you to make money based on other peoples choices!  Thus, anticipating what actions your opponents will make can earn you an important advantage.  It reminds me of 7-wonders, and creates that same sense of interaction even as you do you, and your opponents do what they do.

Although, this does lead me to my number one criticism.  By and large the theme of this game is great.  Honestly, I wouldn't have KS'd it if was based in space.  But alternate history 1920s with Mechs?  Yes please.  However, what the heck is with the enlist action?  Who are you enlisting?  Why are they moving from the bottom board to the top board?  Are they mech pilots?  How were the mechs moving before the enlists people?  Why are they represented by cylinders?  In a game that otherwise does a great job on every detail (I love how resources and worker are wood and heroes and units are plastic) this befuddles me! 

Overall, great game.  If it stays fresh and fun after repeatedly play, I might even move up to a 10!

It's very pleasant that mechs are different for each faction and miniatures are of high quality. The art is just amazing.

First time I played I just let the game wash over me so I could admire the beauty of what $59 and patients brings. The second time I was critical and it is still a ten for and here is why:
The game has some many great things from some many great games. 
El grande has the secret dial for where you will place your mepples. Scythe uses this as the fog of war with extra battle cards. 
Minitures or my personal favorite "board games with Scott" says dolls have be painted made designed for play for a long time. 
Scythe not only has will detailed mintures but a purpose. Plastic can battle but wood can not. 
Settlers of catan allowed you to start at one location and then built were you wanted to go with the constraints of players on materials you need to gather. 
Scythe does this uniquely with rivers and lakes that you will have to travel around. 
Proxima Centria has this terrific tech tree that has four different technologies that you can built that then support your later purchases. 
Scythe has a simple upgrade tech tree that then your faction becomes more efficient with your building. 
Hyperbola is a wonderful 4x game getting technologies or extra moves and extra cubes to advance your clan to getting closer to gain area control of all section exspecially the middle tile. 
Scythe allows you to get an ancient technology that allows for an entirely new two new action selections to choose from. 
Dominare is a game that you can move your influence of people on a board depicting spaces of different political sections. Once you put you influence into a space of someone esle hard fought political investment their cubes can disappear like they were never there. 
Scythe has battle but the mepples and mechs and character do not go away. They just go back home to lick their wounds to come and fight again. 

This is just five game explains of many more to find in Scythe. Just from the five games I have mentioned about a $300 investment to the low price of $59. 
I feel that it does what it is suppose to. It is a game that gathers great mechanisms from the greatest games made. This is why the game should number one. 
And the next game that surpasses Scythe should be a game that takes a bit from it too.

Beautiful, beautiful game, but after a few plays it just didn't excite me as much as some other games at similar playing times. It just didn't seem to click with me and the groups I played with, and felt like a little too much effort to get it to be fun for us.  It was a struggle for me to let this one go, but it had to be done :(

The art is mesmerizing. After going through one game of scythe, you'll understand all of the mechanics. It is quite simple.

Gave it an 8 for now because unsure of where it should sit after 2 plays. 

I wish there would be more variety by more objectives to complete, end game bonuses, or a shift in the different hexes.

After playing it more, you get used to how the game plays and can really delve into the game. It's an amazing game.

Collector's Edition from Kickstarter. Everything about this game appeals to me, from the theme and Jakub's artwork which initially intrigued me and attracted me to the Kickstarter to the lavish production. All of that is very well, and I certainly don't own any other game with anything approaching this level of aesthetic appeal, but what about the game? Well, it actually exceeded my high expectations and I find myself completely absorbed in the experience from set up to end of game scoring. Every decision, every action taken, every move anticipated. And then find myself thinking about it for hours afterwards, eagerly looking forward to the next play.

Yes it was hyped. But for me, it hasn't disappointed at all. Potentially my favourite game of all time.

As has been stated multiple times by others, the production quality in this game is amazing. So much attention to detail with the pieces, the graphic design, and the fancy bits that come with some of the editions. Easily the best production I've seen to come out of China.

RATING: 8
I love what this game is trying to do, and I love the way it looks. It's an elegant little machine with interlocking moving parts that you can upgrade and build to get yourself to victory. The production values are second to none, and every part is designed with thought and care.

The game has engine building, it has area control, and it has resource management. It does also have combat elements, but don't go into it expecting a full 4X or you'll be disappointed.

My main complaint is it always goes longer than the box claims so it can be a bit of a marathon. I've played with 4, but I can't see myself playing with any more than that as it would just take too long.

Not a "war"/ "battle" area control game. More of a resource management/production game with area control aspects. Incredible art. Each player has a different faction that has different action advantages. This gives a nice change each time you play as different factions. If you play give it a few games before making a  judgment on the game. Due to length, I would not play with more than 5 players.

It might just be me, but there aren't enough routes to victory.  First to get 6 of the 8 possible star locations - looks like it's just a question of who can efficiently get to the victory condition first.  I think the variance will be in one or two turns or less than a handful of final victory points.  I need a few more playthroughs, but I worry it won't be a great table game.

On the plus side, the solo play variant is fun.

An engine-building euro, with some conflict. The right amount, I'd say, there certainly shouldn't be more fighting in the game.

The riverwalk mechanic and the "you can teleport anywhere" aspect of the map are minor complaints.

Very good, plays more like an euro than a 4x

RATING: 10
Scythe is without question one of my favorite games if not my favorite game. It is certainly the one I suggest first and can easily play all day. It is designed so that just one strategy isn't always the winner and you don't know what you are going to have to try and do to win until the game is laid out. It also has aspects that appeal to many, resources, expanding your territory, gaining wealth and of course if you like warfare and conquering. It is very well balanced and probably one of the few games that the same couple of people aren't winning all the time. It holds my attention and I'm not reaching for my phone while waiting for my turn which for me, says it all.
When we first started playing this game many of my gaming friends who are women took one look and said no way. After playing though, almost all are hooked.
Can't recommend this game high enough.

Impression after the first game: Disappointing! Definitely it needs more plays to get in the game and the strategic possibilities. It is a 4X game without explore and not really exterminate. It needs more variability, primarily the board. The only variability are the factions and the cards and that's to less for a game like this.
So, I think it's an overrated game. In this day and age a game needs more than a great artwork, a alternative background story and an overhyped kickstarter campaign!

Very good game. Very beautiful design. The player action mechanisms are very great. The different scales are not so easy to balance.
My little deception comes from the board readability: Map is beautifull but is too constrated and too present. I have difficulty to identify correctly the resource that are produced on the hex. It is important to identify the path that each nation can use. May be I miss something...

I think this game is the best for what it is and most people that don't like it didn't manage expectations for what that is correctly before they gave it a try. I like to describe it as "who can farm the best while winning a popularity contest before a big giant robot fight to end it all." 

No one else says this, but it feels like Concordia to me. Takes about the same amount of time (if every one knows how to play, but for teaching new people Concordia is much faster and simpler), same sort of resource optimization, and similar degrees of player interaction. Concordia might do the last part a bit better, but this has more interesting optimization/conversion problems, looks a billion times better, and gives you a better feeling of tension/conflict. Since, you know, you're a burgeoning civilization, and not just yet another trader.

Surprisingly interesting resource management game. In the game I played, we were mostly non-aggressive, but I can imagine this gets tougher when all have played more sessions and then I will start to hate the game.

I had put off playing this one because I didn't think it could possibly be as good as the hype. But after one play, I am very impressed.

UPDATE: After five plays, I'm even more impressed. This is a game where everything you do makes you feel good. There is some luck, and sometimes you wish your boards and powers were different, but the trick here is to exploit your personal advantages as much as possible. Despite the trappings of war, Scythe makes this conflict-averse Euro gamer very happy.

I regret to say that I bought this game in December 2016 based solely on hype, the beautiful art and BGG player feedback, but this game is the reason why you should try before you buy. When I played it solo, it felt uninspired and plodding. But I assumed that was due to no human interaction and a wide open board space created by basically a two-player set up. But after playing it with four players, my thoughts haven't changed. I'm just not excited about this one. Now, I'll get flamed for my poor rating and that's OK. I don't know how to excel at this game and I'm sure that factors in here somewhat. But even if I got better and more efficient at the game, I just know I wouldn't find it fun. There are some cool design elements in this game and the production quality is off the charts awesome, but unfortunately, this one is not for me.

Game is spent generating resources that go toward building non exciting buildings that allow you to build units that will rarely fight. The optimal engine building is guided by the race and board you are dealt which result in scripted play with minor variations. Game usually ends with a player winning two fights for the last two stars after a mostly uneventful 60-90 minutes.

The scripted play kinda kills the replay value, I would not be excited to play this again.

A beautifully produced strategy game. Thanks artwork and components are great, and I love the player board with bad relief and the bonuses under the tokens. It's the first time I used the term "user experience" to describe a boardgame.
Gameplay is more about unit and resource management than fighting for the map.

The main downside for me is the map. Everyone starts in safe areas then can advance to the middle, where there will be fights. It's pretty much symmetrical and, as such, boring. If I was expanding the game I'd start by making a new map.

Ok, with three plays under my belt I think this is pretty damn good.  Of course I was made wary by the hype, but it's got a solid core of Eurogame with some nice 4x elements.  Vaguely reminiscent of the way Dominant Species marries worker placement and wargame.  Only played 2P so far, but it seems to work very nicely at that player count, and each game has felt pretty different as we've worked with the different factions and player boards.  I guess I can imagine the game getting same-y or feeling like it's on rails after a dozen plays, but I'm not sure that'll happen.  Very interested to play it with 3P or more.

Way more enjoyable than I anticipated it to be. I was aware that the game had area control and combat so I expected to not particularly enjoy it, but those aspects of the game are only as important as you want them to be. You can focus your energy on scoring stars in different ways like upgrading, building and getting out all of your workers. You can't ignore the area control aspect completely, but it's definitely not necessarily the focus. This game truly does seem to have something for everyone, plus the artwork is stunning.

I think this is one of the best examples of what modern board games are becoming. Intellectual, beautiful and impeccably designed. 

Component wise this is the star of board gaming, but in some ways I think it suffers from that as many dismiss it as being just a very beautiful game without substance. However, there is a really good game here too!

It certainly gets better the more you play it, so perhaps the first few playthroughs might feel a little flat for some, but it's grown into a fantastic game for me. I think it's improved quite a bit with the Wind Gambit expansion (maybe 8.5 without).

A bit of everything where it always feels like you cannot ever do enough. During my first few plays, I wanted the game to be something different. Once I let Scythe be the game it wants to be, my enjoyment increased. The game is an area control, resource management game, but feels nothing like similar game sin the genre. A special note that this is one of the rare games that still plays briskly at the max player count.

This is a slow burning game, or rather, a slow thawing game, but the tension that builds as you start to feel the ice cracking beneath your carefully calculated plans is really exceptional.

I really enjoyed it.

After one play of this game, I know it will be one of my all time favorites. I love the variability, quick turns and exceptional art. The mechanics work well to make a very balanced game. A few things I wish I would have known in order to make the first play more enjoyable: 1) the manual recommends stopping halfway through the first game and tallying up points so that all players get a better idea of what scoring will look like. This would have been very useful during my first game as I expended all my resources and put popularity as a lower priority. 2) We didn't pay much attention to the factory, but actually if you control it (literally just have a mech or worker on it) at the end of the game, then you get 3 VPs. 3) The expedition cards have really cool stories on them! Be sure show the art and read the choices out loud when you grab an expedition card. It adds an extra layer of depth to the theme.

Scythe was my personal Pandemic Legacy story. Once I tried it, despite a terrible first game I loved it and couldn't play it enough! It's my first Kickstarter regret story also; I purchased the retail edition as soon as it became available, and have since picked up some of the extra stuff like the bigger board extension and extra power dials, but I do wish I had those metal coins and realistic resource tokens!

Plays great with 4-5 (ok with 3) and up to 6-7 with expansion (only recommended for more experience players otherwise the downtime becomes unbearable).

RATING: 7
Bought this at SPIEL16 for €80. Played it 5 times now and frankly I'm pretty much underwhelmed. Sure: the artwork is top notch as are the minis and the game components.

But from a gamers perspective, Scythe is just a "solid" game. It tries to be everything at once without excelling anywhere: ressource management is pretty simple: on commodity can buy exactly one thing (mech, building, recruit, tech). No interdependencies, no variable prices, no limits at all. Pretty simple.

Same holds for the "battle" aspect. As soon as everyone has upgraded their mechs, there are no places to hide. Just build up military strength, jump on the weakest opponent and crush him. Its as simple as that.

Finally the narrative aspect. The so called encounter cards have always the same structure and therefore simply just provide  bunch of free ressources.

All in all, Scythe is a just race to reach as many goals as fast as possible. The number of options while working on that are far more limited as one might expect. From all 2016 games games I'd prefer Terraforming Mars over Scythe at any time.

RATING: 4
While mechanically Scythe is a well made game, it definitely is not the game advertised. This really is a Euro game of efficiency that tries to toss in a few other mechanics to fool you into thinking it is more than the sum of its parts.

If you are looking for a good Euro efficiency game in the vein of Terra Mystica (not quite as good but almost) it is worth a purchase. If you are seeking a great combination of a Area Control 4x game with deep 4x mechanics in a Euro package, walk away, you will be disappointed.

this really fell flat for me. But I know why it did so here it is. 
If im playing small world with only half my army and this other fiddly side board I can handle that. I get it i feel entertained the whole game by messing with that thing. but not at over $80.00 USD. at 45 USD I'm in but more than that your game can take its broken, just play black, only fight twice, rivers in the way was a harder thing than my opponents, game and sell it somewhere else.

I love the artwork and world building that went into this game and the deluxe edition is easily my favorite game in terms of visual appeal.  The game itself is simple in execution with enough moving parts to allow an open ended feeling for play.  Although the game rewards experience there are enough random elements and variety in options (e.g. factions & player board combinations) that I haven't seen a single surefire way of winning.  The game is excellent but the production quality elevates it to a masterpiece.

Downgraded score to five after multiple plays. 

A mediocre game hidden inside a bubble of overproduced art and insane hype. The mechanics are all about engine optimization, but the different engine parts don't tie in with each other nor with the theme in any meaningful way. 

The ridiculously busy board is a jumbled mess where terrain features and restrictions on movement is redundant as everyone is just warping/jumping around anyway. Combat is generally a meaningless option to go for and is also done in a pretty uninspiring way (just spam combat cards). 

The actual gameplay, while mildly engaging at first, quickly becomes a dull affair where you're basically trying to empty your player board as soon as possible by repeating the same shallow moves over and over. But my main gripe with this game is that it lacks a fundamental part of good board game design: player interaction. There is none. And that sucks. 

That a game like this is ranked so highly just goes to show that the general public will always prefer shiny things over substance, I guess. Or that hype is a powerful force. Or perhaps both.

RATING: 8
Really enjoyable "machine" building with a lot of options! Asymmetric factions, all with their own very unique and powerful strengths. Intuitive rules, but it took one playthrough to get the rules to stick. Great art! I recommend adding the realistic resources and metal coins (they add a lot of feeling when playing!). Also the board extension is a good buy. Decent diversity as you replay it. Not as much combat as you'd think, which I liked. The two downsides are (1) that one or two factions are much tougher early and mid game if you don't get the right "machine" with it, and (2) that the end turn can sometimes be a bit anticlimactic.

Se presenta como un 4X pero en realidad es mas bien un euro de gestion de recursos y colocacion de trabajadores. 

La presentacion es acojonantemente buena (sobre todo si te haces con los recursos y monedas de metal). 

Jugablemente es un poco teledirigido para el gusto de la mayoria de eurofans. en mi opinion es excelente, porque te permite centrarte (o al menos intentarlo) en la estrategia para ganar la partida y no en la metodologia de cómo hacerlo siguiendo las reglas mas o menos bienpensadas del juego, que es lo que ocurre en la mayoria de "euros culoduro". 

en mi opinion, consigue la profundidad de desarrollo de los mejores euros, con una presentacion muy ameri, y un desarrollo de juego muy fluido. 

probablemente lo "peor" del juego es que eso de 4X esta muy cogido con alfileres. expansion? check. y de hecho es uno de los factores mas importantes sinó el que mas para ganar la partida. exploracion? check. y es un factor bastante importante para ganar la partida. explotacion? check. y es un factor esencial para poder desarrollarte y ganar la partida. exterminacion? not check. cuando hay un combate (las pocas veces que los hay) se resuelve en UNA accion (bueno, no se para la partida 20 minutos como ocurre en runewars, eclipse o starcraft, algo bueno debia de tener), pero el tema es que al enemigo no se le extermina, solo se le manda a casa con una regañina, con lo cual lo de "exterminar" al enemigo, solo sirve para mantener ocupada la casilla por el motivo que sea que la quieres, y para ganar la estrellita (o dos estrellitas) de ganar combate lo que puede estar bien en el computo global de la partida (el conteo de puntos se activa cuando alguien hace 6 estrellitas de completar cosas que hacer).... pero por lo demas... no tiene ese factor de batalla gorda y aniquilacion del enemigo que tienen otros 4X como los mencionados, y en el balance queda un poco "flojo". de hecho es perfectamente posible ganar el juego sin entablar ni un solo combate, y no digamos ya ganarlo. 

aun con eso, en mi opinion un muy excelente juego. se merece el "9".

Here comes the hype and right there it ends, again.

I'm already VERY cautious when it comes to hyped games, especially with that much chrome. Well, Scythe is not a bad game, but it's not great either. It's just another good game, nothing more and there are many good games out there already.

The game feels constructed and solitaire. It seems that the tunnels and the city space in the middle have been added for the sole reason to get the game moving atleast a bit.

The player board and the popularity track on the other hand are great, but the rest feels way too constructed, just to form anything around that player board.

Good and completely overproduced game, but nothing more.

I really enjoy this game. I had played 3 solo 2p games to learn it, then played a 5 player game, and just now finished my 5th 3 player game with my 13 year old twin daughters. 

My girls have been hit or miss for gaming over the past couple years and I've had to ask to play. They were interested in the bear and tiger characters in Scythe and gave it a try, then begged to play again the following night. We've played 5 games in less than a week, so that right there makes it a winner for me.

Aside from the joy my daughters get from playing, I enjoy figuring out new ways to do things and weigh the options available.

Finally got my preordered Scythe just before Christmas and have been enjoying it immensely. This is everything I wanted Eclipse to be: more cube pushing and (a lot) less conflict. The game is easy to grasp and flows smoothly, but there's a lot of depth under the chrome. Which brings me to the stunning artwork and all-around stellar production quality: it certainly doesn't hurt that the game is gorgeous to look at. (29.12.16)

Scythe keeps being great. The looks are a bit deceiving in that it's really a race to build the most efficient engine and rev it a couple of times to end the game. The spatial challenge in the form of the map makes it so you can't ignore other players and it brings a good dose of interaction. I especially like that when everybody knows how to play we have managed to play a 3-player game in an hour and the game flows very smoothly and it feels like your turn is all the time. (20.10.2017)

I haven't played hundreds of games, but I've played several dozen. This game really changed my perception about what a game could/should/had-to be. No round structure, so no end of round upkeep. The artwork is exciting, every time someone pulls an encounter card I am excited to see it, even if I have seen it before. In my collection, it has the best component quality. It's possible it is my favorite game, but I'm not sure cause at any given time I'm excited to play a few games in my collection. But of all the games I'm usually most excited to play this one has been played the most by me, but part of that is a friend who also really likes it. I thought about giving it a 9.x to leave room for some game I wanted to rate higher but, if a game blows it out of the water for me I can always change the rating. I don't know what to change about it to make it better.

There's so much to like about this game: the richly evocative theme, the elegant mechanics, the incredible production values.  I don't normally like games that involve players directly attacking one another, but it's very well balanced here in that winning a battle tends to be as costly to the attacker as to the defender.  The result is a dance of feints and tactical retreats rather than a bloody war of attrition.

Scythe lives up to the hype. It's a deep game that requires careful execution of a strategy to avoid falling behind, yet as combat creeps into the later game it also provides a means to set back the players who have pulled ahead. I love games with variable player powers and starting setups. In many ways, Scythe reminds me of Terra Mystica in that regard. You will be pointed in a certain direction from the start, but even with the same starting setup, two players may choose totally different ways to execute on it. The biggest drawback for me is the endgame, which has a tendency to bog down in calculations (there is very little hidden information). The penalty for taking too long is to be reduced on one of the tracks, but this is a kludgy solution that is also ineffective sometimes. (A player may be at zero on that track already and take as long as he likes?) I find this game to be intellectually appealing, satisfying to play, and also incredibly difficult to play well. You have to be ready for a heady experience, not filled with thrilling turns of fate, but rather the satisfaction of seeing a plan come together.

After much hype, I purchased a copy and couldn't wait to get it to the table.  We finished a 3 player game and the other two players seem to enjoy it.  I enjoyed it at first, but after thinking about it, I found that it just didn't click for me.  A lot of different mechanisms added together to just a mediocre experience.  I think it suffers from the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none issue.

Scythe is all about efficiency, which means it's all about the excellent Upgrade action. I love the way it works, remove a cube from the top row action (making the benefit better) and add it to a bottom row action (making the cost lower). If you want to encourage more player interaction house rule combat so that the winner is awarded a star only if he was also the aggressor. 

Excellent game, with little down time (even at 5 players) that never drags with either of my groups.

After 19 plays (of which ~5 multiplayer and the rest solo) I'm still not completely sold on the Hype Game 2016. 

Some games are interesting, others not so much. First turns feel scripted; the factions powers are really not that important (the mech powers are more interesting); the encounters lose their fascination quickly. I do like the map mechanics (movement, mechs carrying workers etc; tunnels).

The artwork is unreal but the implementation could be better, as I find the colors too muted.

RATING: 9.9
This is simply one of the best game i have ever played. The rules seem to be quite heavy at first but it gets clear very fast just after a few turns. The player boards where you are upgrading your factions are super well designed as there are holes which can be covered, or uncovered over time by doing it you will get even more upgrades. So basicly this functioning as a tech tree which is one of the most clever idea in my gaming experience. There is a really strong theme going on there with gorgous artwork and the highest quality components everywhere. I prefer a bit more interaction though but at least there is an option to attack each other even if this  happens on a very rare occasion. The interaction is more likely to watch over your neighbours and upgrading yours techtree to get more income till the midgame starts. The playtime was around 2 hours which is acceptable for such a deep strategy game. There is a little language independency but with one person at the table who knows the language can translate the few drawn cards easily. Well in the end im not sure if this has a good price / value or not as the pricetag is really high but you get a chunky box with full of high quality components. I feel huge replayability here as there are 5 factions which of course you would like to play at least two times. After i finished my second game i love this game even more. Fantastic correlation between the choosable actions.

Scythe is a very nicely themed Weuro, with Stegmaier accomplishment stars for one-time achievements, but a rather thematic VP system ranking players on territory, power, goods, and buildings after game end is triggered.

Players have a choice of several actions, but cannot repeat actions in a Rondel like effect.

If reqs are met these can be double actions, so players have to set up and optimize their expansion engines.

Faction boards and action boards are separate as well, so each faction's overall abilities will vary from game to game.

The game includes and encourages Combat between players factions, but it also ceases to reward combat for most factions, which leads to some interesting choices.

The artwork is stunning, and the game is pretty awesome.

I expect this game to improve in rating as it is played more- this is simply a terrific product in all ways.

A great engine builder with some map movement and occasional battles. It's a clever hybrid, having such an abstract, heavy Euro core - the vain attempt at optimisation through the manifold combinations of nations and action sheets feels almost too contrived for my tastes and sometimes broke my immersion... but the wonderful illustrations around which the whole game is built tend to bring you back in. All in all the balance between dry engine building and thematic elaboration makes for a really good game (the artwork probably being responsible for the big hype in the end).
The big question: isn't something like Terra Mystica a very similar game, but more elgant?

Played it and was sorely disappointed. It's an average complexity euro game, whith great production value. It's a good testament to the fact that pretty art does not make for a good game. It's not that it's a really bad bad game, but for the amount of hype it's been getting, and its outrageous price, I'd be expecting something much better.

Our group has played 5 times now, and the same player has won each time. When that happens, it tends to mean that there is one strategy that is better than others, which makes the game less fun for me. It's still fun, and the balance that's baked-in is evident, but sometimes it can fell *so* balanced that the game feels deterministic, like the internal mechanisms of the game are more or less forcing you to do certain things.

RATING: 10
Played twice so far, and I rate it a tentative 9, with potential for improvement!  The game attempts to blend theme, (mostly) luckless mechanics and asymmetry while keeping the playtime manageable.  To this end it is extremely successful, and I look forward to assessing the longevity further down the line.  There are many moving parts, but each player is limited to three or four distinct options each turn which helps keep the game moving very well.

Another two plays.  Up to 9.5.

Played around half a dozen times now, and it retains its appeal.  This is one of the most well rounded games in my collection!  I think it deserves a 10.

RATING: 10
It's really great! The solo modus is fun. It's very strategic for 2 players. Everything between 3-5 players is based a little bit more on luck - but not too much at all. 
The downtime during the game is really low. You can already continue with your top row-action while the last player finishes his/her bottom row action.
I already explained it to many friends and all gamers really like it. It is complicated for beginners - but they can learn it, too :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Cool blend of mechanics that's well balanced but with enough scope for different approaches. Takes a little to get your head around the engine-building side of things and that it's not a "war game" as the mechs would suggest, but once you do it's very rewarding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Eurostyle resource game with the possibility of war (but mostly deterrence). The game has the most elegant artwork ever, fascinating upgrading mechanism, it's an easy-to-learn game with fast rounds, where things start to happen early, with très fun explorer cards - and the game comes with metal coins! Endscoring seems made unneccesary complex (the game had been perfectly good also without the popularity multiplier), not too much player interaction during play, the mechs are too big for the board (yes, it is possible to buy a bigger board, but I will rather have smaller mechs), and the fighting part is a bit boring. Apart from that - love it.

I love this game. Engine-building concept allows you to continuously pull in resources and cover ground on the gameboard. But spreading your nation's territory also means encroaching on another's turf. This leads to constant cold-war feelings while all players decide if they want to go to war for territory and combat victories, while sacrificing popularity (a final score multiplier). Plenty of additional actions, secret victories, encounter cards with bonuses, and player characters with unique abilities keeps the game fun after many plays.

I've played with every player count now & it's great.  This now rates a 10.

The theme of the game is too far fetched. A big no-no for me. 

Movement rules in this game (you can move from tile A to B, but not from B to A) are bad.

Another flaw of this game is that the actions you take each turn are very unintuitive. There is no theme to the actions, they are just incoherent manipulations of the game board. The actions trigger many effects on the game board at the same time, and therefore taking actions feels more like triggering chaos than carefully and orderly expanding.

To me, this game feels like a clusterfuck with animals and mechs walking around in a post ww1 setting, using rules and game mechanics that want to be all, but fail in most aspects. Big disappointment after all the hype.

Own premium edition with the nice metal coins. The coins are definitely worth getting; the regular resource tokens are decent enough. The extra large board might be nice if you play with a full player count but it will require a large table.

Very thinky you must do this-becore-you-can-do-that kind of game. Iconography is very good. The end of game is triggered by someone placing 6 stars on the board (each representing completing one out of 10 possible goals), but you can do very well by focusing on the popularity track which acts as a multiplier on how points are configured.

Disclaimer : I usually like low conflict euros. I have been really disappointed by this game. It really is overrated. The production might be gorgeous, but the gameplay doesn't live up to it : it's too linear, the game gives you the illusion that you have plenty of choices but in reality if you don't follow that optimal path set before you, you won't do well. The asymetry, while present, is only present in slight details and in the end the factions seem more or less the same. I'll keep playing Clash of Cultures and might revisit this one a last time before deciding to get rid of it.

Beautiful and interesting.  A very fast, contrary to what it looks like, worker placement game. Requires you to put your full attention into the game, especially that there is a lot of parameters on your opponent’s action card that you must put attention to.  The military dimension is practically non-existent, which Is strange in the game that is being advertised with the pictures of mechs.  The story behind the game is neglectable,  but there are some comedy relief elements one would not usually expect in anything related to central-eastern Europe’s  history in first half of 20th century. Overall a pleasant game  - much lighter than one would expect, but still not an entry level game. Innovative mechanics. High quality components, worth the price.

Scythe is a solid game with undeniably beautiful production value.  The variable upgrades are interesting and offer asymmetry between players.  You can also focus on different scoring paths.

Components and art direction are fantastic and contribute in no small part to the rating for this game. It's just beautiful to look at. As far as the gameplay, I believe the pace of the game is odd. It starts extremely slow and ramps up way too quickly. I wish the game had different game ending triggers. Unless you are the one triggering the game end conditions, the ending is always anti-climatic and because of the nature of certain objectives you simply have no way to know when the game will end which makes it impossible for you to properly plan your strategy and more often then not, you don't see it come to full fruition. You could argue Terraforming Mars shares a similar type of game ending mechanic but in TM, you have more information available to better estimate and predict when the game ending will occur. I don't think Scythe does as good of a job at that.

After having played this twice, I will say while the consideration of the action asymmetry different players have was done with care in most cases, the actual "freedom" one has is relatively limited. The board is tight, and false choices in one's own actions abound, for if your neighbors are inclined to take certain actions, there are few sensible options for you to perform. Though masquerading as a mech-based game, Scythe is more a euro-style action management affair.

RATING: 8
A nice mix of area control, engine building, worker placement(ish) and resource management. Has worked well at 2, 3 and 4 player counts so far.

Like: Each individual turn is quick, which makes the game feel well paced and keeps everyone involved. The pace of progression escalates nicely, as a 'slow' early game suddenly turns into most players having a star or two of the six needed, with the potential for more not far away. The 'race' nature of the end game makes for interesting choices around priorities, and control over that ending is a powerful dynamic - the "if I had one more turn..." feeling makes for tense, interesting finishes to games.

Dislike: It is possible to lose any chance of winning quite early on, identify that, and still have to play out 90 more minutes of game - it's good that it's clearly identifiable though, as it makes it easier to learn from. The combat isn't great, and can often just make a player a target for someone else to get free stars in the future. Some faction abilities feel more obviously powerful than others, although playing more may reveal different strategies to take advantage of different faction powers. A player prone to 'analysis paralysis' can really slow the game down to unbearable levels - there's no reasonable excuse that a movement action should take 15 minutes to figure out.

RATING: 6
Could have been a great game but falls short on many levels.  The World of Jakub could have been used to a much better effect, here it just feels like some pretty pictures with some plastic Mech's thrown in with an average game buried underneath.  

The game suffers from being over polished and play tested to death.  The game doesn't feel organic, and has no mystery left to discover after one play.  The pseudo 4X label is  just that, a pretend label, the lack of exploring in the game and lack of player interaction, creates a huge disconnect with the world the game is set in.  There are too many ideas thrown into one game that are under developed, and feel dumbed down.  

The players are never challenged to step outside of the rather simple collect resources for stars, game mechanic, which leads to a rinse and repeat game.  Having each race start in the same location every game is lazy design, and the river walk ability is odd.  The asymmetrical action boards are half baked, make the top area of each board tie in with the name, ie - the agricultural board has all the farming hex ability open from the start, but less movement, or zero bolster.  The highlight of the Game is the art work, the worst part of the game is the underdeveloped mechanics and lack of consequence, the game is to friendly, it feels like a child friendly, my first 4X, without the excitiment of exploring and exterminating.

Pros -

a HUGE lack of player interaction, its basically a solo game for up to 5 players

About as average a game as it gets. Sure, lots of effort have been put into the components and there are lots of nuances to the gameplay, but it's all very superficial - a mediocre game that has been pushed hard to try and pass it off as an excellent one. It doesn't have the elegance or simplicity that other area control games have, and it doesn't have the meat that deep euro games have, it falls somewhere in the middle.

Weak/unexciting engine building -> weak/low tension worker placement -> weak/low area control -> weak/uneventful battles. The game needs more unique engine building to make everything else work. The system is there, but it needs something to make the tension rise and adding some kind of involved engine would achieve this easily.

Very good quality components. Interesting artwork and theme. The game itself has some originality in the action selection mechanism (which is possibly the best part of the game), but overall it is an awkward mash-up of engine building that rewards specialisation with a VP salad approach that encourages diversity plus a half-hearted combat aspect tacked on. While combat is not a core element of the game, and generally only contributes marginally towards victory in a direct way, it can really derail a player who is attacked a few times in quick succession. All in all, I get the impression that the designer couldn't decide between an engine-building game, a Stefan Feld-style Euro or a 4X game.

Interesting hybrid with lots of euro feels. Amazing art. 
Factions are blatantly unbalanced (Black being the weakest in my opinion) and the game actually brings nothing special in the world of boardgaming.
It's enjoyable and lasts enough for a good game experience, with 5 players the downtime is a bit bothersome.

This is over-rated.  It's way too long for what it is.

The teleporters are clearly there to make up for the dreadful imbalance that the game would have without them...and they are a serious gimmick.  It essentially encourages 3 of the 4 players to pick on the weakest....which has happened in the 2 games I've either played or watched.

That does not make a game good.  It makes it bad.

A well-realized game of worker placement and engine building, featuring exquisite art and components. By  Jamey Stegmaier.

The asymmetry here makes for great fun, especially at the beginning, when you draw your faction and begin to formulate a strategy based on that faction's abilities. Just a really great game, deserving of its popularity. I do wish every territory space featured an encounter token, because I enjoy the flavor those cards add, but that would probably speed up the game too much.

Visually stunning artwork and easily accessible game.
This game was quick to understand for new players and does a great job of easing players into the game over a few rounds.  Although all of the characters are variations of the same basic formula, there is just enough variation to make mastering a strategy for each one a challenge.  Its streamlined turns made for an enjoyable pace even at high player counts.  The theme is well reflected in the beautiful board, metal coins and various cards.  The highly detailed miniatures are also great added value.
Overall, an excellent game that I'm sure to pull out many times in the future, especially with new players.

Very "thinky" resource game with some very clever mechanisms, beautiful artwork and components (I have the Collector's Edition), plus the constant threat of combat. The Automa for the game (solo version) is also excellent and provides even more opportunities for this to hit the table.

RATING: 7.5
This is a pretty slick game, in fact it's probably a bit too slick. Or really just a bit too streamlined. It felt a bit like the designer sanded most of the interesting parts off of the game.

It did what it was supposed to do, I was strategizing and planning a few turns ahead, but I didn't really feel anything to distinguish this from a long list of competently designed but uninspired eurogames. I think a good example is how the resources correspond one to one with the bottom actions, and how having some mixed costs would maybe just add another layer to the thought process. The whole game felt like that though, overly streamlined.

And I like the special player powers and the different faction boards, but it can be pretty frustrating when they don't align or when the goal cards don't align with them. It seems like you can mostly make it work, but it still doesn't feel good.

Great game in combining light civilization building and dudes-on-a-map strategy.

Hopefully it will get better with upcoming expansions that allow for more player interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a very unique game.  While it has the appearance of an Amerigame wargame, conflict is actually only a small albeit not unimportant part of it.  This is more an economic game than a wargame.  The primary goal is to gain six stars, mostly via a number of economic parameters like building all your buildings or maxing out a rating but also by winning a couple battles.  Even then, it's not the person who ended the game who necessarily wins, although having stars helps.  The game is mostly about maximizing the payoff from each turn while juggling a number of considerations of which board position is only one.  Each turn you can choose one action but you can't choose the same action twice in a row so you have to figure out what combination of actions will get you where you want to be.  Each action also provides the option to accomplish an improvement of some sort, like a new building or a new mech to fight with.  Each such improvement also provides a unique advantage of some sort so you have to choose carefully.  Ultimately you're trying to max out as many things as possible (like build all your buildings or build all your mechs or all your workers) to win stars but you don't have time to do all of them so you have to decide which to go for.  Even then that's not enough because you also get points for number of spaces occupied and amount of resources accumulated and the points you get for these things are in turn scaled by a Happiness rating that you want to increase as much as possible.  The strategy decisions are engrossing but each turn is short so there is little downtime.  Not for the AP (analysis paralysis) prone though.  The quality of the game components is also very high.  There is a post-apocalyptic steam punk theme and a leader who can move around and pick up one of a limited number of mission cards for extra payoffs but this theming is very thin aside from the fun looking figures for the steam mechs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is excellent.  More tactical than strategic, but a ton of game here when weighed against rules depth.  An extra half point for an engaging, easy-to-use solo module that keeps a lot of the feel of the full game but without me effectively dummying 2 players against each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In spite of its gorgeous components and elegant rule systems, Scythe simply isn't that interesting to play. While it features a mix of mechanics - including tactical combat, area control, and Euro-style engine-building - it doesn't reward players for excelling at any of those things. Instead, players race to do barely enough to earn a star in any given aspect of the game. This, along with imbalanced and occasionally uninteresting starting player boards and powers, makes for a disappointing and lackluster experience.

I absolutely love this game! My primary group and our "fringe" group both love playing this game. Every play is different. Some games have a "Cold War" feel. Some games are filled with combat. Every game is interesting and usually talked about and strategist till we play it again (a couple weeks later). A True Euro game if there ever was one.

ONLY drawback in my opinion is the amount of time it takes to teach a new player. That can be very long (30+ min). However, when playing a 2nd time they can even help set up the board; showing a very good grasp of the iconography and general mechanics.

Initial Rating: N/A

I want to play Scythe, the hype has been incredible. It is, as of today, ranked 12 in BGG´s rankings and that’s amazing. I was originally a KS backer but after being burned by Stomemaier Games with Euphoria and Viticulture I decided to pull out. 

By being burned I mean I hate the company’s policy of changing the core rules of their games, it´s like they don’t test their games enough! Viticulture has 3 different versions and 3 different set of rules in 3 years since its release and that´s unacceptable to me. 

Due to this, I decided to institute my own policy of waiting two years to buy any game from Stonemaier Games. I will wait until they release Scythe: The Essential Edition with new and improved rules and all the expansions already in the box.

Current Rating: N/A
[hr]
2017-01-31

A friend decided to gift me the game and when I was buying it I realized it has already 5 different versions. Most KS games have two versions the retail game and the KS edition. Scythe has:

•	Scythe ‐ English special edition (2016) 

•	Scythe ‐ English retail edition (2016)

•	Scythe ‐ English premium edition (2016)

•	Scythe ‐ English only Art Connoisseur Collector's edition (2016) 

•	Scythe ‐ English collector's edition (2016)

I’m not even sure what are the differences! But I dislike that they exist. It seems Stonemaier Games thrives doing this, but after realizing this I bought Inis instead (a good game). I will play Scythe somewhere in the future and perhaps it is a great game, but I hate Stonemaier Games policies, so I won’t buy the game. 

Current Rating: N/A

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2017)

As I dislike Stomemaier Games´ policies, I didn’t want to play Scythe, but this month I finally found myself in a situation in which some friends invited me explicitly to play Scythe so I finally played it. I can say it is a good game but I was expecting better due to the incredible amount of hype.

The rules of the game are pretty straightforward, but there are many rules so teaching them takes around 20 minutes. It plays very fast for the amount of rules it has. It takes around 2 hours with 5 players.

The theme is cool, but eerily similar to Dust´s. There are many game mechanisms that doesn’t support the theme.

The game´s components are amazing, and that’s the other reason I didn’t want to play the game. Sadly, these days I always suspect a game when it looks great. This trend was initiated by Cool mini or Not and their great looking, but ultimately hollow games. Kickstarter is also guilty of that, many publisher offer great looking games with lots of miniatures but the game isn’t as good as the components. Fortunately, this isn’t the case with Scythe, it is a fun game.

The art is amazing.

It is best with 4 players. I didn’t read the rules but it seems you can also play it solo for people who likes this kind of thing.

Scythe looks like a combat, area control game, but it is much closer to an Eurogame with resource management. This is a huge plus for me. There is combat in the game but its impact isn’t as high as most games of its kind.

Scythe´s decisions seem more complex that in reality. Many times you do the same two actions over and over until you achieve what you needed. There are a lot of ways to score in the game (a huge plus) and there are ways to improve the effectiveness of your actions. The player boards are great and they help a lot to move the game at fast pace. From your starting position, you need to trace a short time plan and then execute it. To summarize, the game offers (somewhat) interesting decisions, but they aren’t very hard. The player boards and gameplay are reminiscent of Hansa Teutonica.

Combat plays a minor role in the game and if you lose a combat, it isn’t as damaging a most games. The combat itself is made in a blind bid way, it bothers some friends but I don’t mind it.

The luck factor is rather low, there is luck with the cards but I feel it is controllable. 

The replayability factor is high as each faction is different and new combinations can be created in each setup.

On the bad side, I heavily dislike that the game ends immediately as soon as a player gets his 6 star. This feels unfair to me and gives an advantage to the first players. In our game I was the first player and I won the game, but in the same round, at least another player would have gotten his 6 star as well. I would have preferred if each player has the same amount of turns.

I have bought and sold the game 3 times. I think I must be still mad at how Stonemaier games do business. I will probably buy it again in the future (2018 at the earliest), but I’m expecting a bad move from the Stonemaier Games. I still have very low confidence the publisher won’t change it somehow. I have all the promos for the game just in case I decide to keep it among my game collection. There is no reason to buy the game now as many friends have it. 

Bottom line, I have drifted away a lot from the “dudes on a map” genre, I no longer enjoy it as much as before, but I liked Scythe. It is a borderline 7.0 to me, barely a good game. It´s much more an Eurogame than an Ameritrash one. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard and I’m bothered by the uneven amount of turns between players. I will (probably) eventually buy it. My desire to play it isn’t very high, but it is an enjoyable game and I would play again if requested. It is overrated though, I don´t feel it is a top ten game, but most of my friends love the game.

Update: Beginning to feel that while it looks like a wargame and a well-timed strike can rob someone of a bunch of resources and give you a star, the really important parts revolve around Euro-efficiency-optimisation. Or 'bleh' in my book.. Sold
..........................
After 2 plays it's certainly good, a few more plays required to determine whether it's great or not.

The design is very good, with the interaction between the various game elements being the highlight. The first part of the game is Euro efficiency engine building, with squeezing the optimum efficiency being the key to fast development.

There's more interaction in the second half of the game when the mechs get mobile and conflict s at least a possibility - and a good way of getting your all-important stars played.

Only two plays in, and when it clicks it's great but you can find yourself fighting against the efficiency aspects, especially if your secret objectives don't align with your strengths. Unless we played something wrong, the Rusvet mech ability that allows moving straight to the factory seems very powerful - get there quick, choose the best factory card, and milk it to get an early, potentially unassailable led. (Experience may find flaws, or at least counters, to this tactic).

- This game is really interesting.
- I love the engine building aspects, the achievement system, and the encounter cards.
- I really like the concept of the factory in the centre where players can pickup a single stronger action card.
- It also has great aesthetics, and the different player powers/boards help differentiate players and give them direction.
- I'm not fussed either way on the battle mechanics. Battles can be a bit bland as the outcome is rarely surprising and doesn't have too much of an affect on the game (other than for scoring an achievement). Like most people say, this game is more about the threat of battle than actual battling it out, as players can generally chop each other down at the expensive of opening themselves up to an attack from someone else.
- The scoring system is interesting as a player's overall scoring position is not always obvious, leading to unexpected, and potentially seemingly unjustified/unthematic results.
- I wish the encounter cards weren't handled with tokens, but rather that there is always a chance of an encounter when you move into previously unoccupied (by you) territory.
- Despite the somewhat negative thoughts above, I really enjoy playing this game, as do my friends. It's fun to build a little empire, build mechs, unlock abilities, and go attacking (once or twice).

Great production (although you have to pay for it) and a fairly good game.  However I don't feel there's anything particular clever here and I can easily see this collecting lots of dust after a few more games.

My first Stonemaier game and colour me impressed. Well designed, tight and can take a full player complement without extending the game length. Add to that some of the best art I have seen and you are onto a winner.

Very well done.  Nice art, game mechanics, and flow.  Not sure I would really go with 4X since you're not Xtermniating anyone, you just drive them back, but you do engage and can take someone out of competitive position.  Realistic game pieces make for a nice addition.  Love the game, one of my favorites.

Stunning components and a streamlined combat system, but (1) _lots_ of down time (2) game peters out-- seems like the interesting decisions for my faction were at the beginning (3) not much tension (4) for being so much like Eclipse, Eclipse is more to my taste. There's more that goes on, more likely viable non-war strategies, and more drama.

First impressions (7). Pretty good. Still a few things I'm concerned about, that will likely shake out over repeated plays.
---
Second play (7), everyone did better score wise. I'm liking the game, but I fear there are some problems with it mechanically. Nothing that "breaks" the game, but things that definitely make the game feel like a seesaw. At the beginning of the game bottom row actions aren't completed very much (due to cost), so the bottom row feels wasted/inefficient. In the middle of the game you are using these actions, but there is a tipping point where you have exhausted their usefulness, and they go back to feeling wasted/inefficient (which feels really strange in a "Euro" style game).
---
Third play (7), I like this game, and I want to play it. I'm trying to figure out if I am judging it by it's KS pedigree, and my past experience with KS games, or if I honestly think the game has mechanical problems. I still feel the same about the bottom row actions.
---
Fourth play (6), OK I've pinpointed the part of the game that has been bothering me. I was deflecting it onto the action selection, but it's the star race. 

The star race makes the game tense, but for all but one person it also makes the game sour. In all four games someone has ended the game abruptly with a multi-star play, leaving everyone else caught off guard and a bit sour. 

Not because we didn't know it could happen, but because it's impossible to track everyone else's status and play your own game well. It's easy enough to track one star at a time, and plan a bit for that pacing, but the ability to complete 2 or 3 stars (common) and up to 5 stars (perfect world) in one turn really makes it impossible to do anything but concentrate on putting out stars (stars are the largest point swing). 

If it was a race to win, like Istanbul, you get your sixth star you win, I think it would feel less bad. But the end game scoring after being blindsided by a big play, and needing just 3 more turns feels like a kick in the stomach. Even the winners have had the same feeling, it doesn't feel good to win.

For the first time after playing I felt like this game was going to have to be removed from the collection, which is a bummer cause it's beautiful, and thematic and "cool" it's just too long for the way it ends, and that's just not fun.
---
Fifth play (6), Well this one was really lopsided. 106 to 41. 6 stars to 5 stars. I wouldn't say that the other player played poorly, just had a hard time closing the gap. I really want to like this game, and I do until it ends, then I feel bad. And I think it's just a little too long for it to feel bad at the end, even when winning.

Such a great game.  The first few moves are scripted, but after that you are able to do whatever you'd like.  The final expansion looks like it will add much more replay value.  Great engine building game with resource management, and a little combat.  I have played this with both 2 and 4 players.  At the 2 player count the game does lose some of the tension, but it still works great.

2016-09-03 - This is a really solid game. It looks like a conflict heavy thematic game, but it's really a strategy-heavy Euro game (which is great). I don't know if Terra Mystica and Eclipse were conscious inspirations, but I love those games, and this one seems cut from the same cloth.

2017-11-06 - I had this game at an 8 because of BGG's older rating scale, but it has always deserved better!

I have played this game 3 times and each time someone won by a different method. Even though it is a 4x no one actually gets destroyed thy just have to retreat and I see this being a plus for those people who hate to be attacked in games. I feel that I have lots of control, deep decisions, and my favorite part having to watch closely what the other players are doing so I can shape my strategy around it.

it's not terrible, it's just not very interesting.  to play well you just need to figure out how to optimize your actions with your personal board and resources near your start on the map.  I'm not a fan of big direct interaction games where you just attack each other all the time either, it's just nice to have some subtle and constant interaction in the game.

Inoffensive but not exciting; much of the game happens off the board while huddled over your own player-mat, calculating routes and planning in advance. Feels too solitary, too lacking of conflict to be really enjoyable.

Also, the mechs are REALLY ugly. Whoever designed them should watch more anime.

I do think I want to give this game another opportunity.  However, there seems to be a way to win this with bull rushing and multiple battle victories...I feel this detracts as then the gameplay doesn't fully develop.

The artwork and production quality for Scythe are an absolute 10. They make you want this game to live up to the unique vision presented by Rozalski's epic paintings. You want to dominate the landscape and win the hearts of the workers! However, each time I played this month I became more and more aware of the disconnect between the incredible thematic art and the game's objectives and mechanics. This is not an epic experience game that tells the great story it promises, it is an efficiency engine game that is entirely focused on action-improvement, in which you win primarily by maximizing each category of efficiency faster than the other players. You work to get workers, buildings and mechs onto the board to do... what? Spread out? The problem is that simply getting them on the board IS the objective for most of the game. Once you get them all out, the game is pretty close to finishing.

Encounters are another vivid example of the thematic and mechanical disconnect inherent throughout the design. The artwork on the encounter cards is frankly the best part of the game. The art is so good, there is no text describing the encounter. Jamey wisely lets the art speak for itself. The cards present three moral choices: one benign, one opportunistic, and one exploitative. In a game that presents the juxtaposition of military and pastoral in such vivid illustrations, I want my moral decisions to shape my destiny - to define who I am - as a leader. Encounters present a great opportunity to accomplish this, but bafflingly work directly against the theme instead. There is no lasting effect of your moral choice. The cards then become anti-thematic and entirely mechanical. You are going to make the choice that makes immediate mechanical sense for your efficiency engine and discard it, rendering the implications of the moral decision utterly meaningless! Why set up the promise of a moral decision with no lasting moral impacts?? Why not design these cards to give an ongoing effect that reflects your decisions as a leader? 

Objective cards also miss the mark. What is significant about grouping pieces in a certain way or stockpiling resources for no purpose? Building goals like building all of your buildings in a straight line only serve to remind us just how arbitrary and disconnected these goals are from the brilliant 1920's post-apocalyptic setting.

RATING: 7.5
Amazing merge of wood (eurogame) and plastic (ameritrash) that works apparently well (after my first game), maybe the fact that the resources remain in the board, so they have to be permanently controlled, is the nicest innovation here. With some -not bad- feeling of chaos, and too many things to do in so little time, this game can lead to a heavy AP in deep eurogamers, this is a tremendous danger because its mechanics requires  celerity.

Superb edition after a great KS campaign as usual in this publisher, unfortunately the playing experience lacks most of the theme and the art. It's a pity, the publisher-designer contracted the services of a good artist, but the abstraction and the limited immersion do not completelly capitalise it.

Really great game. I most enjoy building the efficiency of my player mat. But don't forget to watch what other players are doing, by focusing on your internal engine too much!

RATING: 9
My initial rating after 2 solo plays is a 9. I hope to play every faction solo against every other faction (at least once - not all combinations) and to get some 2 and higher player count plays in soon. My rating could move either way, but probably not by much to the low side unless I find something wrong/broken, which I have not heard reported. The game is setup on my dining table and will remain there until I can get a handful more plays in - partly why it took so long to get the first game played.

Real positives (other than the fantastic production quality - kickstarter premium): Quick player turns. Strategies that are about 3 turns ahead. Combo'ing the top and bottom actions. Variability in setup. Though light, asynchronous starting positions. Very workable solo mode. Though I can see already that playing against the Automa is a different game than against other players.

Potential negatives: Slow and massive setup that can limit playing opportunities. (Though, it sounds like that isn't hindering many game groups, it is a problem for mine that meets in a game cafe with only 1 large table not dedicated to miniatures). Min-Maxing AP potential.

For Scythe, Stegmaier unpacked his proven principle of mashing up mechanisms from other widely recognized games. Most notably, it's Terra Mystica this time with the different faction powers and the positional play on the board coupled with player boards inspired by Hansa Teutonica. He recycled the game end condition and the fate cards from his own Euphoria. Added to this are generic resource management and engine building systems.

This is done professionally and as usual for Stonemaier games, with outstanding production values. Scythe is his first game that doesn't feel like a late-stage prototype. It's a heavy eurogame with the possibility for direct confrontation. However, playing Scythe as a wargame is a surefire way to losing. Military strength is mostly a deterrent, cold war style. The few battles need to be carefully planned and timed. The essential part is the efficient usage of primary and secondary actions with purposeful engine building as the prerequisite for that.

With all the hype for Scythe, I was all set for a disappointment. Having said that, I liked it and would play again. A solid game although overrated. A couple of issues make me wonder how this game ended up in BGG's top 10:

- "Set piece" nature: The factions always start in the same position. Only the player boards differ. Reading through the strategy guides on here for each faction, it's a bit like learning chess openings.
- Player order: The immediate game end will most likely lead to some players having a turn less. Given the importance of having the last move, this can be a decisive disadvantage without any compensation for being late in turn order.  
- Player positions: Being squeezed in between other factions is a disadvantage.
- Combat resolution: Sacrificing military strength for battles will leave players vulnerable. Sacrificing strength for a high-stake battle and losing can be devastating. Unappetizing bottom feeding can ensue.

Three plays in, and this is my favorite design in a long time.  Make no mistake about it, it's not a conflict game or 4X, but it's even more unfair to say it's multiplayer solitaire.  It's pure Euro efficiency engine, but one where players have to ability to disrupt each other's plans.  The pragmatics of play are most reminiscent of Terra Mystica, in the sense that many actions lead to what I heard once described as "little kicks," meaning small boosts that release gamer dopamine for jobs well done.  However, the overall vibe reminds me most of Age of Steam because careful planning must go into the earliest turns based on board position and other starting gamestate, with highs and lows being predicated on concordance with an initial strategy.  I strongly suspect that weak play in early turns can torpedo any chance of victory, but them's the breaks in this sort of game.  Having said that, in terms of options, the more you look the more you will find, and I get the sense that the design has been crunched to the point that there is no one single dominant course of action.  Also, and much less important, it's physically beautiful and thematically non-obnoxious.

Worth all the hype. Few games are this impressive on the table, and fewer still are this much fun to play with mechanisms this easy to grok.

KS Art Edition. Looks superb.

Plays extremely well. Not a huge fan of the combat cards but difficult to see what else could have been used, hence i'm only giving it a rating 9!

The AI (normal level) can also be quite challenging.

I would rate this game higher but for the fact that with 3 players there is far too much space on the board - the land-grab at the end is therefore a bit too easy so the winner can be greatly influenced just by that one last move. The faction which gets to choose 2 out of the 3 explore options for the character is also way too overpowered for 2 & 3 player games. Five player games are also too long.

I would improve this game by having more player boards for 2,3 & 4 players.

This game's amazing production value doesn't quite make up for its lackluster gameplay. The economic portion of this game is decent but the wargaming portion quickly descends into "bash the weakest player" meaning that if you get behind early you can look forward to spending the remaining 90 minutes with no hope of winning.

Still, you can't deny it's very pretty to look at and the components are amazing.

As much as I enjoy this game, I really think it is overrated. I haven't played yet with 4 and I do appreciate that it has a complicated single player mode, but I feel as though I know enough to say that it isn't quite as good as something like Terra Mystica from the strategic end of the scale or Blood Rage from the fun end. I really do feel that this game would be lucky to break the top 100 if it weren't for the artwork and being as expensive and complicated as it is probably shouldn't get all of the attention it's received.

I'll need more plays with this first. But luckily I want to! I enjoyed the resource building aspect and asymmetry. Lots of pieces, but luckily it is very simple to play out. Beautiful production. Not as heavy or long as I anticipated.

The ending as a little wonky as many of the later options become obsolete as you've "deployed", "recruited", or "built" enough times rendering those actions obsolete later on, despite maybe some other particularly minor side effects.

I really don't see the BGG top 10iness of it though. Like a pop song, this game has been smoothed out so much, and made so "safe", that it relinquished the drama and grittiness from the gameplay. I never really stressed out, or felt engaged with the system.

Excellent game, excellent production value, get lots in the game.  The engine building part of the game is by far my favorite. Even though combat is not the focus, if you leave your territories too unguarded, people will attack you and it is a major setback for the loser.

RATING: 10
This game blew my mind. Easy to learn, difficult to master - unlike many people claim (game is on rails), I strongly disagree. The first two "rounds" if I may call them like that, since the game can go so fast at the beginning can give some sense of being on rails since one of the base mechanics (and understanding deeper strategy) is to plan ahead. If I want to upgrade, I need Oil, The action to get Oil essentially tells you what to do - if you want to follow that idea. However hitting the first encounter can change your strategy and give new options (now I can suddenly build a building, although I had no Wood) which then can have an effect on your later turns and so on.
There is no bad decision in this game, but there are many not so good and better solutions to your overall approach, still as long as you understand, that the most effective way is to work towards activating both the top and bottom row actions, doesn't necessarily win you the game. Reading the board and now when to strike (and not talking about long drawn out wars, that's not what the game is about) - but a precision strike can throw back your opponent more than just a turn, it can be crippling indeed, if you don't pay attention.
So combat is not what this game is about, but knowing when to strike and how to keep your defenses up is certainly very important. Also knowing your faction abilities (and mechs) and how to implement those to maximum effect.
The other upside to this game, even at 5 Player count I had games going for a hair under 2 hours. That's amazing for a game of this scope. In my eyes it perfectly meshes all kinds of genres and mechanics into one elegant smoothly running machine. I have yet to encounter a combination that is "broken" since knowing how is half the game. Your opponents are essential to victory (and here is my other observation which most people and reviewers don't seem to mind) - yes, you can play solitaire and hope for the best, that your engine produces the most coins - however if you watch someone turtling in his corner, attack him! It's the best way to not only disrupt their engine, but also snatch victory, since losing areas and resources is huge in this game. I don't like to say that people who criticize this game "don't get it" or "play it wrong" and then blame it on the design but sometimes I do feel like that. Its a pity that some people think like that and try to reduce the game just to that particular point of view. It is easy to tear down a game to one aspect and then claim "it turns out like that, always" (which isn't true) - this game offers a lot, way more than meets the eye and after over 20 plays I'm not getting tired of it. The expansion just adds more of the great core game and ups the game in player count to 7. Haven't played that yet, but I don't expect it to last much longer than with 5, since the design is so elegant and smooth.
My Game of the Year 2016!

Gorgeous production values, beautiful art and relatively smooth and nicely asymmetric gameplay. Surprisingly prone to AP as you better try to plan multiple turns ahead. I'm a bit doubtful regarding long term replayability as each faction always has the same stale starting configuration. I especially liked the encounter cards, good story, enlist mechanism and the fact that it is possible to do well with a peaceful approach. In order to do well you need to aim at doing two actions a turn as often as possible. On the dislike side I somewhat feel that you shouldn't be allowed to trigger the game end if you initiate a battle. I also feel this might be at its best as a two player experience.

This game has always looked too intimidating to me and I never really had the urge to play it. Even after watching some videos on how to play and stuff, I always had that "Huh?" aftertaste. Also, my wife and I were burned out on resource management and worker placement games.

Finally got around to playing and after seeing it up close and personal, I can see why it is a good game, but I can also see why people were disappointed in it.

It does employ mechs, but they are only one of the many paths to victory and may not even come into play. For those who are expecting a "mech heavy" game aren't going to get one that often if at all.

Regardless, I liked it enough to warrant more plays.

Very good game of managing efficiency and the threat of combat. I really want to try all the factions and discover some absurd combos.

Not so hyped about the expansion though. Fun factions but eh, the japanese art. Also, tokens. Not really a fan.
But like the gme enought that I will pick the expansion up and hope it surprises me :D

Got the very fancy version because the price for premium components was a lot cheaper than what it would cost me to make them myself (I tried) and I do love artbooks.

While Scythe is an incredibly well designed and produced game, it lacks, just slightly, when it comes to creating a truly cohesive gaming experience. Though it appears to be a strategically deep game, I personally found it somewhat hollow when it comes down to it. I originally rated this game a 9.2, but I feel the lack of real meaty substance has caused some of its allure to fade. I will say that this game will appeal to a wide variety of people, and is a great gateway game into more heavy (and arguably better) Euro games.

+ Not good at battles? No problem, negociate with coins
+ Very different valid win strategies
+ Faction and Strategy boards offer great replayability
+ Easy to setup for such a big game

- So many game mechanics that it is difficult to grasp for inexperienced boardgamers
- A lot to keep track of for individual players during the game (where can my opponents move; damn I only have a mech and no worker in this territory; did my neighbour activate a bottom row action ...)
- Negotiations and combat have to be limited to 1min each or the downtime will be too long in a 5 player game

Wow what a brilliant game. The miniatures are great, artwork is gorgeous and a solid game is present unlike other kickstarters with miniatures and no game. The games has a deceiving look such that people expect a combat heavy game because of miniatures but the game is a straight up euro with theme. You gather resources to accomplish objectives move around the map to broaden your territory and score points in various ways. Besides multiplayer playing solo is also so much fun. Automa is aggressive, expansive and provides a good challenge. No wonder this game got so many awards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
edit Oct 2017: Ok, came late to the party, played automa (easy) to check the gameplay. First of all the components and artwork are amazing, the game mechanics are really nice but when it comes to the solo play after 7 rounds my enthusiasm faded away. Its a race against time to beat the automa and i cant say that i m thrilled about it, sure it will shine as multiplayer but i wasnt attracted to by the theme anyway, so the verdict is that i ll probably keep it to my collection because its a milestone to the kickstarter boardgame funding but my dark basement will be its destination...

=============================================================
Most overhyped game of 2016! I didn't backed it at kickstarter although I watched its campaign and i turned it down because of the theme (mechs are cool but i didn't liked the alternative 1930's history). Alas, once shipped to backers all over the world and the first reviews and sessions started to appear (especially the solo ones) the hype got all over me again and this time i had to find a kickstarter copy for sure, which i did after 2 months search. I know that it uses successful  mechanics from other games but since i don't own/played them i don't care, i ll have to find out my self when i ll play my 1st solo session.

RATING: 7.5
2017-09-20 - 7.5 - With a very big hype at first and decreasing my interest for the game after watching some reviews and the game itself being played I played it without too much expectaions. I found Scythe to be really good, solid game with a lot of interesting choices. The fights are rather unexciting, but the fact that you lose quite a lot of your strength after winning a battle is something that is not so obvious to figure out. The popularity track is a cool thing too. Player boards are very euroish and rather solitare, but fortunately there is a main board, which sooner or later forces you to pay attention what is going on there.
One more thing - Sctyhe plays unexpectedly smoothly for what it looks like and there is not too much downtime.
I liked the game and will gladly play it again.

Not a hybrid nor Eurotrash, this game is a pure optimization Eurogame. Which, for me, is very strange given the effort to insert a theme in a very dry game. The game felt longer than it is and only the last 4 rounds are interesting, because the tension to get all six stars is present.

Enjoyable game. A little concerned after 2 plays that the yellow faction might be slightly over powered, but so many people have played this game that it would be apparent if it was. Looking forward to the solo play and the expansion. Good figures, and not too many of them. A good range of cards and I like the promo sets being available to add even more variety if thats what you want to do.

Collector's Edition. Awesome game! I played it four times in the first week I owned it which I have never done with a big game before. Even my wife loves it and she doesn't really care for complex games with a lot of rules. This one hits the sweet spot between accessibility and complexity. I certainly wouldn't call it a gateway game but I could definitely see teaching it to and playing it with anyone that could handle games like Catan, Small World and Lords of Waterdeep.

This is my favorite game of 2016 and the best game/value that I have Kickstarted. It's early to call, but this game is almost certainly destined for my top five. This is the example that game publishers should be striving for in terms of components, rulebook, iconography, art, ease of access, replayability, accessibility and value.

Our first three-player game took three hours but our next two with the same players took only an hour and a half each (we played them back-to-back, it's that good). Turns are near simultaneous with three players, so there is very little downtime.

The game is very intuitive and after the first few turns, you know what to do and how most things work. From that point on, it's a matter of learning how to optimize your actions and developing an overall strategy.

There are five asymmetrical factions, each with their own special abilities. There are also five different player mats that have the same abilities but with slightly different costs and benefits. Each game you play, you get a different combination of these. Then you add in different secret objectives, different factory abilities and different end game bonuses for buildings and you get a heck of a lot of replayability.

If I had a complaint (and I don't) it would be that there isn't a whole lot of player interaction during the game. The board is big enough that you can pretty much do your own thing in your own corner of the map without much interference. I am sure in four or five player games there is a lot more interaction as players jostle for resources and space.

Super game! If you like worker placement and area control, you should love this one!

This game is way longer than advertised. Played this with some friends. one person had action card that complimented their country and had a couple good starting rounds. That snowballed into a rofl stomp. The game turns are fast once everyone gets a hang of the rules but it is such a grind to do anything. Lots of minis and bits do not make a game good. It requires exciting and balanced gameplay.

Stunning artwork, top-drawer components, smashing gameplay.  The rules don't take long to master, but there seems to be a lot of gameplay here.  The closest game I own is Eclipse, and if it wasn't for that game's tech tree, I'd say this one had it beaten for sure.  Even with that in mind, I still currently prefer it.

It's possible 5 players was just a bit too slow and it didn't help that one player wasn't planning his moves ahead of time, but I think the hype on this one is a bit unwarranted. The pace of the game can be frustrating because it can take several turns to do what you want to do. But there is also a lot to like here and overall I enjoyed my play and want to play again. However, if I were to by a Stonemaier game, I'd get Viticulture instead.

I can't get my family to play board games so I buy games that have a solo mode.  I have played to solo version of Scythe multiple times and it has been an amazing experience.  It took me an hour to read the +20 pages of directions and several hours of youtube tutorials, but once I completed it, it was actually very intuitive.  It has definitely been worth the learning curve.  The artwork is terrific.  I think Jamey Stegmaier has a masterpiece with Scythe. I will play this game for years.

Wow, that was really fun. And I don't know if I ever experienced a more exciting and fresh theme (even though fresh in a post WWI setting is the appropriate term). 

I have some balance troubles though and I think it is really unnerving to get factions on a map that I can't play.

Other than that: very, very good game!

Was really dissappointed with this game. I kinda understand why people like this game, but then again it just doesnt compare to other games on top 30 list that i have played. 

Artwork is 10 and the product is very well made, but for me it feels like a video game from a big company with fancy graphics and perfect UI and no bugs at all. But it just aint fun.. When i pull this game from the box and start setupping it i just dont get the same excitement which i get for example from terraforming mars, eclipse, puerto rico, trough the ages. I just want to be done with it so i can get back to our other games.

I cant really explain why its not fun for me. Maybe its too simple somehow or the factions are too similar? or maybe the tactics are supposed to feel different but still it just feels boring as hell. I would not recommend this since there are similar games which are more fun.

Huhh, elsőre volt mit emészteni rajta. :D
A játék igazán nagyon szép, tetszik az a hangulat, amely a festmények, a játéktábla, a figurák és a játék során kialakuló helyzetek által megelevenedik. Ugyanakkor, mivel a megjelenés nagyon erős, tematikusabb játékmenetre számítottam. Persze ez az én bajom. :)
A mechanikák egy része egészen különleges. Két saját táblánk is van, és a játék során ezek változnak, a mechek táblára vitelével újabb képességeink lesznek, az akciótáblánkon pedig a fejlesztések által egyre olcsóbban, egyre több dolgot szerzünk. Ezen a területen is van egy kicsi egymásra hatás, ugyanis a többi játékos fejlesztései során is kaphatunk jutalmakat.
A táblán nálunk kevés konfliktus volt, és ami volt is, nem volt túlságosan markáns. A csaták kimenetele elég jól megjósolható, és úgy éreztem, hogy a vesztes sem bukik vele olyan óriásit. A játéknak ez a része azért kicsit furcsa volt, mert egy kiélezettebb küzdelem után mindkét fél veszít annyi erőt, hogy a nevető harmadik könnyedén elvehet akár mind a két játékostól területeket. Mondjuk a célokat tekintve szerintem olyan nagyon sok csatározásra nincs szükség, így talán nem jelent hosszútávú problémát (persze több fővel ez változhat), de magának a csatának a mechanikája egyáltalán nem tetszik, pedig ígéretesnek tűnt a tárcsaforgatás + lapkijátszás.
Mindenesetre rengeteg jó ötlet van benne, az én ízlésemnek picit túl sok a szabály, részemről hevi juró kategória, bőven van számolgatni-, kombinálgatnivaló.
A népek különbözősége, más-más területeken való erősségük/gyengeségük izgalmas elem, valószínűleg döntő lehet ezek optimális kihasználása, ennek átlátására biztosan jónéhány játékra szükség lehet.
Majd még jó lenne játszani vele, de egyértelműen nem az a típus, amire nagyon gyakran vágynék.

Great look, great art, great components, satisfying gameplay, and asymmetrical factions. Love the theme and the engine building. It's not a heavy game and is really easy to learn. It is also not a combat game and isn't supposed to be, which seems to be a knock for many people. But just going to war is costly and likely has more negatives than positives, just like it would in real life. The threat and avoidance of combat is more intriguing to me than a strict battling game. I really enjoy the multiplayer solitaire aspect and I have gone for different strategies every play. There's still enough player interaction to make it interesting, but working on building your own engine without having to constantly worry about other players is really satisfying. Hard to find any faults with the game. A definite favorite.

The whole game just make so much sense after you played the first round,and it has different ways to win the game which makes this game so fun and unpredictable. Each faction has its unique ability. You can have different combination of player mats and faction mats which makes this game to have so many variables each time you play. Miniatures and resources token were amazing! This game has quick start cards which make it so easy to teach new player.  I like the ways to play combat and the variability to win the game. Very good strategy games.

1 partida.

A la espera de probarlo con más gente, porque en partida a 2 jugadores el mapa se hace demasiado grande, por lo que hay poca interacción entre ambos y va cada uno a la suya. Además, la partida se me hizo demasiado corta, porque aún quería hacer muchas cosas y ya habíamos llegado a 6 estrellas.

Sin embargo, el juego promete a más jugadores. El cartón con tus acciones disponibles simplifica muchísimo la dificultad, que de otro modo tendrías que memorizar cada acción y sería mucho más lioso. En el propio cartón, hay hendiduras para saber dónde colocar las piezas y las mejoras... está muy bien conseguido. Otro punto positivo es el arte del juego, con sus ilustraciones, el mapa colorido, las figuritas de los protagonistas y mech, etc,

Scythe is a great strategy game that shines with its brilliant art and components, fast-moving turns, diverse factions and high replayability. 

My only criticism is the end game's abruptness when someone places all six stars.

Really enjoy the game. The artwork is fantastic. Nice combo of worker placement and area control. The event cards add some interesting flavor. And the player mats are some of the best quality I have seen. Haven’t tried any of the expansions yet.
There does seem to be a huge difference in game play depending on player count. In 2 player you may never cross paths. 5 player you can get cornered easily if not careful.

Scythe: Invaders from Afar (2016)

Scythe is a pretty good game with phenomenal components. Once you get the hang of how the actions work, gameplay is fairly intuitive. I am glad I backed it on Kickstarter, but it is not as exciting as I hoped it would be. Perhaps this is because the act of getting stars is removed from the theme (which is otherwise so well done). Or, perhaps it is that the strategies don't seem diverse enough to add much variety over repeated plays. Or, maybe it's just that the decisions you make aren't very interesting.

The last couple of games we played just weren't that fun. I had no desire to get this one to the table, so I let it go.

RATING: 9.5
My favourite Game. Art, Components, Gameplay, the perfect match. Not toooo heavy, short actions, mixture of tactic and strategy, fight and euro. Something for everybody. If there is ever a perfect board game. This is the closest i know. 

The design of the gameplay is so great you can literally teach it too people while you play without 1 hour of rule explanation. It's so much fun to try out all different factions and player boards and their combinations and there are a lot of different ways to victory. Perfect Game with a bit of hectic at the end when the last stars are dropping.

As many options as this game gives you from simple actions, it is a great design. The endgame almost leaves something to be wished for, a little more foreknowledge of where you are in comparison to the other players, but I guess that's not too different from other games.

doozy of a game. it's *excellent* solo, and i'm dying to get it played with humans as well. kinda gives me "caverna exhaustion" when it's all done, but i suspect that'll change a bit the more i get it played. setup is also intense at the moment, which makes it harder than other games to get to the table, even solo. i usually can only get away with 2 hours, and this clocks in a bit more than that for me at the moment. still super fun and challenging. easy to get lost in it. a beautiful escape.

Simply a pleasure.

I particularly like how often in the game you get two bonuses together - such as when you enlist, uncovering a future bonus and taking an immediate one, or when you upgrade, making a bonus better and a cost cheaper.

I also was very surprised to find that, even in the retail edition, the player mats come double-layered with the indents for all your pieces! How deluxe! I absolutely thought that was one of the upgrades, and I flipped when I opened my retail box.

The main board mechanisms of this game seem so good.  But everything about this game is random and variable depending on unknowns not on player choices.  Several blind Card draws in the game, encounters, military cards, achievement star cards, which all have a substantial imbalance possibility with them.  The faction abilities also seem imbalanced, but I've not played enough to ferret out the good from the bad.  Matching the top and bottom boards, if randomly done, can be imbalanced, someone may get move and produce tagged with bottom actions that can nearly always be used while some cannot depending on starting resource locations.  Just not my cup of tea, don't really want to play again.

Area-control euro with player interaction. Almost too good to be true...and it is.

90% of this game is a beautiful solitaire. Production quality is amazing, but the game itself just isn't there.
The element I feel is the most lackluster is combat. I understand the cold-war tactics that the game mechanics force you to employ, but the deterministic nature of it can often push players into mid-game stalemates.

Update:the third expansion seems to be a run for the money. Adding story instead of fixing the core problems with the game.
Only reason this remains in my collection is my wife enjoying the multiplayer solitaire aspect.

Unbelievable beautiful artwork. The game may not be the most innovative in the world, and the tunnel-mechanic is even a little bit annoying because it makes it very confusing who can reach which part of the map (actually you can almost cross it in one turn that way which is not what my group likes, we prefer "real" map mechanisms), but all in all it is enjoyable - and the artwork alone let's us all wish to play this one more time. Still the game end can come very fast because some combinations of nation and action boards are much more powerful because they work perfectly hand in hand.

When I played Scythe, I knew it would be in my top 5 favorite games. I grew up playing Risk and this scratches a similar itch even though they arent extremely similar. The upgrade system is pure genius. I love that doing bottom row actions almost always allows you to have more than 1 benefit. Im a big sucker for variable player powers in games and each faction plays differently than the others and makes you adjust your strategies accordingly. Can be kind of confusing for new players, but once they learn the basics, it is actually quite simple.

Rating after just one game, will adjudt as I play more. Really nice game, easy to teach and to learn (in terms of available actions and how to play). Great feeling of the strenght building up an of the lethal threat of the opponents... Shall I continue to develop or attack? Great components, awesome artwork and theme. Will see table time for sure and it'll take a while before I'll feel I know/get bored of it. All 4 players had a blast! and I haven't been so excited post play for a looong time (ask my GF, we drove for 1h30 the day after the play and talked about it the whole way... she hadn't play and thus, basically almost fell asleep as she couldn't picture anything I was saying, but from my excitement wants to play it to see for herself.)

Update after 7 plays: yep, this is a strong 9 for me... had the opportunity to play it with the same person and new ones (including 'non-gamers'). although with new players to game can drag on, it always ends up with the whole table liking to loving the game...great experience for everybody. Myself I do like the fact that every faction plays differently as well as every player mat. the game stays the same but the path to follow are always a bit different and this is great as it thus plays out quite differently... probably my fav game of 2016!

Update after > 10 plays, still loving it, playing it with the 2 first expansion and still having a blast... will stay in my top for a while...

7/9/16: Unbelievably Beautiful!

Extreme depth in the planning for the scoring round. The game is deceptively set-up to encourage to work towards objectives that help you to trigger game end(stars), but the real meat of the game is balancing the game end trigger with setting up for the scoring round and navigating the in-between!

Phenomenal, asymmetrical game play. This one is a winner

Scythe is even better than I hoped it would be!

+ Beautiful and well though out components
+ Intuitive rules
+ Fun! Combats are simple and don't have devastating effects for the loser which we like in our gaming group. 
+ Lots of variability even though the board is static. You have to adapt to different player boards not follow the same route every time.
+ Quick rewarding actions (some players can of course have AP on their first game, but all in all it's a relatively short game)
+ Good selection of mechanics that work well together. Interestingly, I didn't enjoy Terra Mystica nor Dune and I wouldn't even want to play Kemet but I do like Scythe :)

- While the rules are are well written and are not complicated, there are still lots of them. Thus, I wouldn't play this with people who haven't had much experience with board games.

Scythe is a Worker Placement/Economic Engine board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.

Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction’s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).

Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player’s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are “encounter” cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.

Love the variable factions and mats that give so many combinations and forces you to vary your strategy from game to game. It is deceptively simple to play though there is a lot going on and turns are really quick. Combat is realistic and strategic not luck based. they don't happen much which is appropriate for this engine builder. The threat of combat is the deterrent  needed and it can be costly.

Mhh. Why that much hype? Yes, it's a good game and the miniatures are awesome. But it's also quite non-interactive and I can't see that much replay-value. The factions are the same for the most part. Their special abilities don't make a huge difference. Fighting and its mechanism is horribly bland and for the most part you're just trying to optimize your turn in this huge point salad. Long story short: I prefer games with more direct interaction.

The game puts up a lot of restrictions to keep the players in check, which on the plus-side translate into accessibility. You get to do a little of, well, not everything, but a lot. And that is both a boon and a curse. There should be at least something for everyone here, though you’re not allowed to do very much of it. Choices are mostly very soft and efficiency is about studying and following your player board. If you want to stray you risk falling behind, wasting turns getting back on track.

Scythe doesn’t miss its mark completely, but basically I find the gameplay very artificial. Even though the main design works well within itself, it almost feigns being interactive and ’fun’ through its machinery while showering you with freebies left and right. Presentation is what got my attention originally and unfortunately that’s still why it gets the attention it does. Very much a try before you buy.

The variable boards look like cosmetic difference at first but actually completely change the way you plan and play.  With all the different boards, there's actually a question about all factions & action boards being really balanced (same as in Terra Mystia).  Interesting choices, solid mechanics, a bit unforgiving on mistakes if playing with good players.  End of game can be a bit sudden and will generally screw 1st time players.  Production wise, this is solid but reuses the same bits as Viticulture which feels a bit cheap (the windmill in particular is rather anachronistic).  Needs a lot of table space.

After a video review: This games does not seems for me. I hate the dune like combat, and it feels more like a resource management game. The only thing intriguing is the solitaire mode which I wonder how they do it.

Else there is a couple of interesting mechanics, but it's more interesting ways of using components than mechanics.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed my first play - game looks quite pretty on the table if you're using the collector's edition! Each player has different abilities and must pursue victory in ways that work best for them. Much like Hansa Teutonica, one can remove stuff from the player board to enhance and improve future actions...although in certain cases, it can also cost more (IE, production if you have a good number of your workers out on the board). Watch the popularity track - determines your multiplier for three different end game scoring conditions. There is some combat in the game, but it usually doesn't feel overwhelming - and one can certainly turtle/protect relatively easily. Each player chooses one of 4-5 actions on their turn which may have enhancements if you can pay the costs. I expect the game will play relatively quickly once people understand how to play. My learning game with 4 players (2 new including one who asked a ton of questions) took us 3 hours including rules explanation.

Ameritrash veneer on a beating Eurogame heart. It's beautifully rendered and the theme comes through well, but it lacks a spark. It would have been great to have had some kind of political layer that pulled the players together and forced a different kind of interaction than simply squabbling over territory. Rating may go up with more plays.

Excellent game of light civilization development with a military component.  I like the mechanics and the ways in which upgrades both empower actions and make other actions cheaper.  I like the relatively simple elegant ruleset and the feeling of a race to build stars and gain popularity faster than one's opponents.  There seem to be multiple paths to victory as well.  I also like the quirky theme and artwork.

It was better than I expected. My friend has the collector’s edition, which he insisted was worth my time. I’m not into tabletop miniatures, so I wasn’t initially attracted to playing Scythe, but it felt more like a Euro-style point salad while playing, which is right up my alley.

Admittedly, the theme and style of this game are huge interests of mine, so that does help elevate this one even further. However, that being said Scythe is also a phenomenal euro/resource management/area control game. It borrows many elements and mechanics from other titles and blends them seamlessly into a tight and surprisingly energetic bundle. This is a heavy-ish game, but it doesn't overstay its welcome, it also ramps up at a great pace. The beginning feels very different from the middle/the end, lending to a satisfying 3-act structure. 
If you have even a slight interest in euro titles, give this one a try!

Scythe est un jeu de plateau qui se déroule dans une période des années 1920. C'est un temps d'agriculture et de guerre, de coeurs brisés et d'engrenages rouillés, d'innovation et de bravoure. Dans Scythe, chaque joueur représente un leader déchu qui tente de restaurer son honneur et de mener sa faction au pouvoir en Europe de l'Est. Les joueurs conquièrent du territoire, recrutent de nouvelles recrues, récoltent des ressources, gagnent des villageois, construisent des structures et activent des monstrueux mechs.Chaque joueur commence le jeu avec différentes ressources (force, points de victoire, capacités de mouvement et popularité), leur choix de plusieurs factions spécifiques. capacités, et un objectif caché. Les positions de départ sont spécialement calibrées pour contribuer à l'unicité de chaque faction et à la nature asymétrique du jeu. Le jeu donne aux joueurs un contrôle presque complet sur leur destin. À l'exception de la carte d'objectifs cachés de chaque joueur, les seuls éléments de chance sont les cartes de rencontre que les joueurs dessinent lorsqu'ils interagissent avec les citoyens des cartes des terres nouvellement explorées qui vous donnent un coup de pouce temporaire au combat. Le combat utilise aussi un mécanisme de sélection d'action simplifié (pas de rounds ni de phases) pour maintenir le gameplay à un rythme soutenu et réduire les temps d'arrêt entre les tours. Bien qu'il y ait beaucoup de conflits directs, il n'y a pas d'élimination des joueurs, et les unités ne peuvent pas être tuées ou détruites. Chaque partie de Scythe a un aspect de construction de moteur. Les joueurs peuvent améliorer les actions pour devenir plus efficaces, construire des structures qui améliorent leur position sur la carte, recruter de nouvelles recrues pour améliorer les capacités des personnages, activer les mécanismes pour empêcher les adversaires d'envahir et étendre leurs frontières pour récolter plus de types et de ressources. Ces aspects de construction de moteur créent un sentiment d'élan et de progrès tout au long du jeu. L'ordre dans lequel les joueurs améliorent leur moteur ajoute à la sensation unique de chaque jeu, même en jouant une faction plusieurs fois.

It's a well oiled machine. Once you get the hang of it, it plays very smoothly (the iconography and smart design is amazing). The art and build quality is top notch.
Gameplay-wise it's a great engine builder. Bear in mind that the area control aspect is there to help keep players in check, but it's not a focus.
First I disliked the abrupt ending but it really is another layer of skill to predict when the game will end and plan your actions accordingly. I often feel like I could've achieved so much more with just 1 or 2 extra turn, but it's not a bad feeling that makes me disappointed, but a rather good one to make me want to play again. This is my personal taste and YMMV.

Scythe is a well designed economic area control with variable player powers. The artwork is phenomenal and the replayability is very good. The combinations with player/faction boards really makes the game shine with cool engine building synergies. Combat can be a decisive moment in a game. When you use a lot of power pts and still loose the fight it is heartbreaking. However, the game is not based on fighting and therefore I'm overall very impressed by the game.

This is a top game, it mixes the economic, conflict and area control into one solid game, the mechs are not just for conflict, since it gives you up to 2 winning tokens, but the threat from them affects other players strategy, solid and satisfying game from the creator of Viticulture.

Initial Impressions: If this is a 4X game as it was sometimes advertised as it is missing many of the 4X elements, and if it isn't a 4X game it is a good but far from amazing Euro.

The game seems more about completing objectives and managing resources so that you can always pay for the bottom action when you do the top one too (with a little bit of timing in case of opponent interference). Some of the ways to get stars also feel not really thematically tied at all (e.g. you have military power, but don't spend it). Therefore, it doesn't give the civilization building feel at all, and while there are upgrades they don't feel like you are learning new technologies, as they only make your other actions better.

It obviously lacks explore since the map is static and nothing is hidden, and its exterminate aspect while somewhat present is really weak. Combat is more a threat than something that actually happens frequently (in my game there were only 2 combats, and while I could see some play styles that would cause it to happen more frequently it still seems amassing troops is more as a deterrent). That you only have 1-5 combat units on the board at a time doesn't help with making combat more nuanced. I also don't like secret bidding especially for combat. 

The poor combat also hurts the expand aspect, as while you can get a lot of points for expanding the lack of constantly jockeying for territory makes the expand less interesting.

The game also seems like it would be fairly samey in the beginning of each game, in that despite the different factions/action boards/objectives/you can go for different ways to achieve stars each game, they overall feel of what you do is still similar.

The encounter cards just don't feel that thematic. The story behind each one feels too disjointed from the rest of what you are doing, and so while they have flavor art and text that makes sense with the setting they just feel like random resource bonuses.

As for why I rate Terra Mystica so much higher, to be honest maybe I was too caught up in the hype of it. I don't remember my play of it enough to have a good gauge of it is actually my type of game. If I do like Terra Mystica more, I think it is due to the balance of being near opponents so you pay less for settlements vs. being far enough away that you have space to build (whereas here it seems like you basically always want your workers far away from opponents, and mech relatively close), you can build more, the factions feel more different, and that while there isn't movement it feels like you can affect the land more by terraforming.

Despite all the things I mentioned I dislike about this game, I did enjoy it and feel that the relatively simple action selection turns tied to chaining of these actions, along with the added logistics of the spatial map was cool. It just wasn't super innovative or anything deserving the hype, the artwork, or its ranking, and so it left me really disappointed.

Cool engine builder.  Stunning art and theme.  Shorter game than Terra Mystica with more interaction (combats, forced retreats) that you must take into account.  Efficiency is rewarded in this game big time and a few mistakes (wasted turns) will cost you.  More opportunity to be foiled by other players actions than TM, but careful players can counteract.  Fun game that lives up to the hype for me.  Will also add that the Tabletop Simulator version is of high quality.  After many plays though, certain boards feel like your optimal overarching strategy is predetermined.

I FINALLY PLAYED SCYTHE.

And it was glorious. I understand the hype now. I don't know if I'd put it AS high as the hype does, but it's definitely a very solid game. I love the way that the worker placement works, and blind bidding combat is one of my favorite combat systems. I generally dislike area control, but this is definitely one of the best ways that I've seen to do it.

I was the Norsemen, Chrono was Crimea, and Patrick was the Ruskis. I think I liked my ability most out of them because it gave me a lot more movement flexibility (I made it to the Factory first and got the best Factory).

Chrono actually ended the game a turn before I could, but I still managed to pull ahead for the lead because I had more $ before points were counted. I'd managed to rarely use the actions that cost $ and made a ton from the bottom bonuses.

The game is overproduced, which some like, but not in a great way. While the hero figures look great, the mechs are worse than my 90s version of plastic battletech mechs.  I also disagree with the "extended Map" phiolosophy. Either the game is meant to be played on the big map (which then should be standard) or the small map. Printing a second version on the back that is either superfluous or needs $15 more to buy is a rip off in my eyes. 

The game also feels like it has some nice ideas, but after all, the only important element is popularity and the rest is gained as a side effect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The initial relation to this game being like Terra Mystica with the combat system of Kemet, while not a bad description of some aspects, is still woefully inaccurate.

It does have a board of "stuff" that you are trying to move onto the board, or elsewhere on your player board to increase abilities or create discounts. There is a resource you spend, plus cards, to perform combat similar to Kemet. However, the rest of the game is area control and trying to meet goals, all the while gaining yet another resource that increases your VP multiplier.

The game is fun, varied, balanced, and beautiful (even if you didn't get the collectors this is beautiful). It starts at an 8 with an expectation to rise.

The extra resources and the metal coins and miniatures are nice.
Really nice playerboards with the wooden components.
All playerboards should be so, that the wooden components fits on it.

I like the post-apocalyptic theme or fallout games.
This game could be sometimes boring snd was tedioud, even the combats, but still a nice game.
A euro-friendly game, especially the combats.

Update: We do not play it anymore. After another game night, we stopped playing and quit and set up another game. It does not offer us anything exciting where we have more fun with other strategy games. And that's what it's all about.

[microbadge=5][microbadge=2984]

Scythe is definitely a well-designed game, although a bigger question would be if it was also [i]fun[/i].  This is more ambiguous, I found.  There are certainly fun parts, but the whole suffers from some critical drawbacks.

First (and this has been said repeatedly before), there are too many disincentives for combat.  One of the places that Scythe succeeds over a game like Terra Mystica is that there is more direct opportunities for interaction, down to actual displacement and victory points via stars.  However, you are punished for even initiating combat due to the popularity penalty (unless you have the Polish Camaraderie ability), forcing you to rely on the threat of combat, which is generally disadvantageous to both parties involved.

Second, the speed of the turns feels off for what is supposedly a 4X efficiency game.  The rounds go quickly enough, with very little downtime, but the turns themselves are actually too short, giving you too little to do with too small of a result.  I would have been happier with slightly meatier turns in exchange with slightly longer downtime.

Finally, the amount of interaction on the board, while direct, is almost arbitrary.  Most of the game is played on your player mats, with the hex map and enlistment bonus technically providing interaction with only a few moments of actually engagement ever happening in the whole three hour game.  Granted, these few moments are often highly important and exciting, but there's too little of it.  Again, Scythe succeeds over Terra Mystica in this regard, but still fails compared to any number of 4X/efficiency games on the market.

Get strong and hold away your enemies? Or take initiative to rage into war and be aggressive? Great game, i love it (incl. the theme and the arts)

Un jeu atypique de gestion et (un peu) d'affrontement. J'ai aimé la grande originalité des règles, le renouvellement des parties, l'affrontement "non violent" (les unités battues ne sont jamais éliminées, elles retournent simplement au campement de base).

Le terme 4X (que j'ai découvert récemment) ne convient d'ailleurs pas vraiment à ce jeu : il s'agit d'un jeu 3X et non 4X (les phases d'exploration et d'expansion n'étant pas différenciées dans ce jeu).

Enfin, je me marre toujours en lisant les temps de partie indiqués sur les boîtes. 90 minutes ??? Dans les rêves les plus fous... notre partie a duré près de 3 heures (comme je m'y attendais).

A Euro game masquerading as a war game.  The game itself is a race to get six victory "stars".  Each player has a unique faction and player board and this is random at the beginning of the game.  So each game has a random setup although the board itself is static.  It is a resource collection game where you must take one action but optionally can take another action if you have the resources.  Generally, I like the game, but I don't know if is the greatest game ever.  It clever and the variable player mat and faction ability is unique.  The art and components are great.  

I like the game it is solid, but it is not the greatest game ever.

The asymmetry adds a lot of variety and it's cool to try out new strategies with factions you haven't played before, or trying out an aggressive strat, or even a pacifist one. I really like it and my only issues with it are incredibly minor and mostly to do with terminology. Definitely worth checking out.

I only played about half way through the game so my comment may be premature. We just wanted to play other games. It's the best mix of resource gathering and map combat I have seen in a while. The game flows very smoothly. Everything you do costs you which stops the whole "runaway king" issue that many map styled combat games have. It had many different ways to win outside of combat and you couldn't win through winning combat alone which forced players to spread their strategy out. It's a very beautiful game and was easily the most impressive looking game at Dicetower Con 2016. The Only reason it doesn't get a 10 for me is because the first turns are almost mapped out for you and very slow... it would just be easier and quicker to start with more. A++++++++++++++ I cannot wait to spend my paycheck on this beauty. PS: A little bias: It has bears which I love AND the bear's last name happens to me my last name. A++++++++++++

I respect the accessibility and production value, and I can't imagine myself turning down a game of Scythe. There are just other games that I find more engaging or thrilling (Terra Mystica for the engine-building/resource-management, Kemet for the relentless combat, Eclipse for the 4x economy-management and combat).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Has fantastic components with clear rules, and it scales well from 1-5. The mechanics and the theme coalesce into something truly special. Combines the asymmetric area control of Chaos in the Old World and Blood Rage, the personal player board economy engines of Through the Ages, and Rex/Dune's combat dial system with plenty of its own innovations. Oh, and the art is evocative and inspired.

[b][thing=169786][/thing][/b] is entertaining, but it's not something I'd like to play often.  And if I play it again in future, it'd only be with a group of people who aren't particularly competitive or heavy into negotiations.  It conjures tensions I once had from games like [b][thing=121][/thing][/b] and even [b][thing=483][/thing][/b] and I don't like it (and with a group of hard-core gamers, I think I'd downright hate it).

3/2017 Very nice game.  Components and productions are top notch.  Theme seems slightly "pasted on"; was this initially a space investigation/evolution/combat theme?  The space theme would have worked better, but then it might have too much resembled other 4X space games, i.e. a variation of Eclipse.  Then again, it's definitly not 4X, the 'resource management' category would be more applicable.  Still, a very good game.

RATING: 9
I was skeptical of this game due to the amount of hype it received prior to being released.  However, Scythe has lived up to and surpassed my expectations.  

It's branded as a 4X game however it plays more like a standard euro game with added player conflict.  However, victory can be achieved without ever having to engage in player combat due to the variety of ways to earn victory points in game.  

Besides the amazing 1920s alternate timeline theme, the best aspect of this game is how the upgrade mechanism for your faction works.  Using resources collected and/or traded, players can pay to upgrade their top row actions on their player mat which makes them grant a larger benefit the next time this action is selected.  When upgrading the top action, the player also gets to choose any one of the bottom row actions to upgrade which makes these actions cheaper to purchase on future turns.  This is the first time I've seen such a mechanism in a board game and it not only works great but is very rewarding.

Replayability for this game is also excellent with each faction having a different faction bonus and initial set up.   This is then combined with player mats that have alternate positions for the top row and bottom row actions so that you generally will get a different combination of faction and player mat than your previous game.  There is also a large variety of encounter cards as well as factory bonus cards which also add variability into each game.

Overall, I can't recommend Scythe enough.  It's definitely one of, if not the top game released in 2016 as it appeals to euro games and ameritrash gamers alike.

RATING: 5
A nicely produced game with superb miniatures and graphics. However, the gameplay suffered too much problem: discrepancy between starting powers, too many rules with not much decision each turn (many are too obvious, or others are being limited by the amount of resurces you have), the theme and gameplay doesn't match at all (I think it's better if they changed the entire setting to a steampunk/ sci-fi one would be better, as I can find no correlation between the map/ starting powers and 'europa'). With a game this complex and expensive the reward is simply too few.

I had the fortune to play the English Art Connoisseur edition multiple times, and it's gorgeous, with all the chrome and the bling one could hope for, from the book of the game art, to the metal coins, to the metal resources and the dual layered player boards with recessed/indented spaces.  I also had a chance to play the regular version.  I believe that the Art Connoisseur version is so impressive and so beautiful that it hides some of the weaknesses of the game itself.  Playing with the regular version, without being blinded by the chrome, the game is not as impressive and some of the weaknesses appear.
1)  Components:  excellent! (Art Connoisseur version)
2)  Rulebook -- very clear, with good organization and examples.  I like the fact that it basically encourages you to jump in and play with the knobs of the game, and even gives hints for an absolute beginner of what to do to get familiar with the game.
3)  Rules.  Clear, cogent, easy to understand and divine, make sense and are easy to remember, so that one can focus on the game.
4)  Variability/replayability:  At first impression variability is excellent, however after playing multiple times it is not as variable as it first appears to be in spite of the asymmetric factions.
5)  Mechanics.  The game feels very polished, does not use dice to resolve combat, has an interesting map, and plays fast.  However, the action phase often feels limited and can be repetitive.  Downtime is noticeable in spite of the designer's efforts to reduce it.   Often you feel the pressure to optimize your turn.  I found myself criticizing my sub-optimal choices, and I am not usually a min/max player.  The illusion is broken, the optimization puzzle is revealed, and this is not a feeling I particularly enjoy.
6)  Combat/luck.  No dice, combat is resolved in a satisfying matter with minimal luck, no dice, uses a mix of planning, strategy, and bluffing.
Everyone should get at least one chance to play with the Art Connoisseur edition, especially while the game is still a new experience.  Unfortunately, the enjoyment curve has decreased with repeated plays in spite of the many good things about the game and the tactile/sensory experience.  It went from a very high initial rating of 9 to the present tentative score of 7.

Others have said what I think, so I'll just copy and paste that:
It's ok, but not really what I was looking for. It's a euro through and through, nicely produced with fabulous art--if it looked like other euros, no one would be talking about it. There is little real confrontation--you battle to get the points, not to dominate. The contrived board bugs me (symmetrically placed tunnels, dopey river crossing rules that make no sense) as does the very nature of a multiplayer 'war' game where everyone spends all their time staring down at their player boards trying to plan out which actions the game will let them take.

I think there are lots of better euros, if that's what I'm looking for, and also many Ameritrash games that do this in a much more exciting way.
The production value is exceptional and the artwork gorgeous but the gameplay is simply mediocre. Easily the most overrated game on BGG.

Kickstarter.  Standard edition kickstart, but the components are still fantastic, and the art is exceptional.  It's a hefty box, and honestly I was a bit intimidated after watching the Watch it Played video, but the instructions are presented very clearly, and the iconography is pretty clear after you get going.  So far, I've only played one time on the easy solo game, but it was engaging and challenging.  Took a risk at the end to raise my hearts up in an extra turn, and the automaton pulled a no-op card, which ended up as the difference between win and lose.  The turn actions are all pretty clear, but lend themselves to fairly deep strategy, with a lot of interactions, opportunities converging on various fronts.

I'm looking forward to getting my gaming buddies in on it this weekend to get a feel for the multi-player.  A lot of reviews have indicated a lack of interaction, but in the solo variant there was plenty...there were at least five combats in the game I played.

Individual decisions are light enough that I'm hoping analysis paralysis doesn't become an issue, but that's my biggest fear with a larger group of players.  There's a fair amount to keep track of, but the components and design are tight enough that it gets fairly natural quickly.

Good chance the rating will swing +/- after a few more games.  Bumped to 9.5 after additional play, game friend approval, fun 3-player game, I got pretty whooped.

Played once. Some of the best art that has ever been in a boardgame, and gameplay is more than solid.
Although described as a 4X game, it isn't really (the board is fixed so no exploration, and extermination is a big word for a few combats here and there with no casualties) but what remains suits my tastes really well.
Really enthusiastic right now, wonder how it will feel after multiple plays.

RATING: 10
Simply gorgeous art. Outstanding theme, with a wonderful map of hidden gems. A shame the hex outline hides the moomin. Absolutely gutted I didn't go all in for the collectors edition at Kickstater, but glad I picked up a copy later down the line.

The gameplay is very social and addictive, without the hindrance of too much AP. As expected from me with a game of this complexity, I made many mistakes on the first few playthroughs with family and solo. Phil's expert guidance at Brotherhood of the Dice meetup soon put me to shame with his excellent rules guidance. Easy to understand rulebook despite my own personal setbacks.

The one criticism I have is that I would like more to come from the narrative element of this game. I understand this is probably unrealistic, but the art is so evoking of an epic journey of conquest and exploration. It seems a shame to only come across it so many times on the map (if you manage to get to an encounter token quick enough!). A negative out of a positive shall we say?

Genuinely exctied to buy the expansions (and metal coins/realistic resources).

Obviously not a popular opinion here, but this game didn't impress me.  First, even though it gives the impression that you're playing a "dudes on a map" game, the interaction between players was severely limited. The games I played the winner barely interacted with other players, if at all. Second, the game feels like it's just picking up steam when it ends.  A lot of games are like that, but with this one it's particularly bad.  Every game I've played once it ends, I've always said - "woah... that's it?"

Decisions are tense and interesting.  Strategies feel rewarding, and the game flows very smoothly.  This game took all the things I like about modern board games (place a worker, take and action, build your engine, upgrade, manage resources, tactical movement, excellent blind auction combat, area control, exploration, just the right infusion of story and style), and combined them into one slick package.

Not a bad game but expected so much more. It's just a pure euro game with minimal interaction and the engine optimization is also fairly simple. Still it's fun but not great

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
EDIT: Played it 21 times so far and my opinion hasn't changed.  The game is excellent and very well balanced considering all the variables you have to deal with.  I've played this game in all player counts except 7 and it works well in all player counts.  This is my #1 game at the moment with Viticulture EE + Tuscany expansion as my #2.

After playing it four times (two 4-player, one 3-player, one 2-player), this is one of the most finely crafted games out there.  I didn't buy into the Kickstarter hype because I wasn't a fan of Jamey's previous works like Euphoria, I thought this would be another game that didn't meet the hype.

While this is overhyped, it is still one of the most well-designed games I have played in a very long time.  It doesn't reach the depth of games like Food Chain Magnate, but this doesn't necessarily mean the game is bad.  It's like saying the Audi R8 is a terrible car because it isn't a Bugatti Veyron.

What makes Scythe work is Jamey understands the limits of the Tabletop medium and tries his best to convey dense important information in an understandable format.  It is a game with numerous components but it doesn't come across as intimidating because of its understandable icons and the layout of the playmats.  The interaction between the player mat and the map is a marriage between sensibility and intuitive mechanics.

Another great aspect is the game itself isn't that hard to understand.  The bulk of the gameplay is revolved around picking one out of four actions from your playmat, do that action, and your turn ends.  On your next turn, you cannot pick the same action.  Some players might argue that it doesn't feel like a "full turn" because your actions are limited, these micro turns allows the pace of the game to smoothly instead of long downtime between turns.

Finally, the game is an efficiency engine game.  Some players might be turned off to the idea, as I am one of them, but what makes Scythe work is the different mechanics.  Unlike efficiency engine games like Terraforming Mars, where you are merely grabbing cubes for the sake of grabbing more cubes, Scythe works because you can efficient in one area of the game that gives different mechanics over everything else.  For example, having a combo that is very good at building Structures allows you to view the game quite different than playing with a faction/player mat combo that is dedicated to deploying Mechs out quickly.  It's because of these different mechanics that the efficiency engine style of Scythe works so well when compared to other dry point salad euros.

Is it overhyped?  Yes, it's definitely is.  Is it a bad game?  No way.  It's going to evict a few games out of my collection for sure.

I look at this game as an efficiency engine. Could have been a lot better if the combat system is more than just secretly turning dials. Anticlimactic end game trigger also didn't help. Components are very nice though.

You look at the game box cover and you think its gonna be a smash and grab game of apocalyptic combat. Instead, you're gathering resources and what little combat exists merely sends the loser running home to mommy. On top of that, bizarre movement rules mean you might have to traverse halfway around the map to move across a water obstacle your opponent can move over at will. Fail.

Invaders from Afar

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game combines "area control" (without excessive combat),  with "economic development/engine building" (without the need for empire building), and goal achievement (that's more than simply a race). Each of the three aspects are scored/totaled for victory. 

The theme (steampunkish WWI Europe) is a huge lure for me. I love the puzzle aspect of getting your faction upgraded and powerful and mixing it with the strategy to achieve goals and control territory. You are very focused on yourself, but you must pay attention to others, as its not just a race to goal achievements, but being ready to capitalize on the points awarded at the end. The downside is the length of time to teach the game. Nothing is too complex, however, there is a lot of aspects to cover.

RATING: 5.5
This game is mechanically sound, looks nice, and I would play it again.

BUT, it also has a shallow-to-nonsensical implementation of theme, a purely mechanical 'do stuff to do stuff' approach to gameplay, and left me finding it difficult to care about why I was doing anything except 'because the game demands it'.

The pursuit of stars feels like ticking boxes, or chasing Xbox achievements - as soon as it's done, you cease caring. Resources become near-redundant. Mechs are built, and buildings spring up, not because you necessarily want to build them, but because if you rush out all 4 you get a star. Even combat is often "I don't really want to, but..."

Yes, there's efficiency at the heart of the game, and enjoyment from puzzling through that, but it's an artificial heart that smoothly hums along. I appreciate it's mostly streamlined design, but I want to build, fight, populate, even farm for a more involving reason than 'because'. Too much polish, not enough guts.

FUN: Scythe has an absolutely beautiful exterior, but underneath the hood many different gears purr like a well oiled machine.

UNIQUE: a Euro game that combines  farming, (cold) warfare and exploration. The upgrade system is pretty clever as well and letting the art speak for itself was brillliant.

NEGATIVES: not as interactive as I had hoped. The game does not play as it may seem at first glance and it might dissapoint some people going in with the wrong mindset.

In my opinion this game is overhyped. Yes, it is beautifully made, lots of parts and so on, but greatly lacks interaction between players. Combat is available but most of the time you will stop trying to pick a fight after winning 2 battles to get those two stars on track. You just wait for your turn thinking what to do next. Could be compared to Game of Thrones 2nd edition, but GoT is a far more fun and challenging game - Scythe has far less combat and diplomacy. Yes, you can bribe and so on but most of the time you won't do that. Scythe is like taking Nexus Ops (move in hexes and try to control certain tiles for your benefit), Catan (for trying to hinder other players), Game of Thrones (combat and negotiations, but far, far less of those) and Power Grid (resource management). It is a good game, but most definitely not worth the ranking position it is at right now.

Miniature Market Preorder.  Received 6/27/16.

Amazing variability.  I love how different each faction and player mat feel.  The variable encounters, structure bonuses, and objectives all make for a different game each time.  The tension in the game escalates well, as you really feel the pressure to accomplish more goals or increase popularity after someone puts that 5th star down.  I'm also beginning to enjoy the nuances of combat and the fact that it's as much about the threat of combat as actual fighting itself.

Played two sessions of 4-player games. 

Not much player interaction.

Easy to turtle the entire game. 

Combat has *huge* room for improvement. 

Artificially forced map constraints in early game = frustrating early game. 

End-game condition can come as surprise for most players, creating a disappointing experience. 

Randomized upper and lower boards setup is cool. I can see it working most of the time. But in 1 of my 2 games, I got a bad combination for the Combat faction. I tried to play to its strength as much as I could, and had one of the most boring game experience in recent time. Eventually won the star-race and ended the game, came in 2nd, felt totally under-whelmed.

Overall, Scythe is very well produced. But not as good as hyped.

Will not want to play again.

Enjoying this quite a bit a couple of plays in - very smooth, fun engine building along with the best components and artwork any game has ever seen.

Only negative so far is that the objective cards and faction/player mat combos aren't balanced - we'll probably draft factions/mats going forward to reduce that issue.

GAME!!!

This game has a great theme, and the player/faction mats are implemented so well! There's a one player variant (very cool), but this game can seat up to five players!

The one thing that stops this game short of greatness, and certainly it's no fault of the game itself, is that it is a fucking COMMITMENT! Seriously, if you're with a group of people who've never played this, be ready to spend the first hour explaining the rules... and then the next hour clarifying things while you play. I actually played a SEVEN player game once, and we spent 3+ hours on this bad boy. I mean, don't get me wrong, I had a blast, but I'm a patient man. I imagine some people will find the whole thing to be a slog, ESPECIALLY in the beginning.

I'd liken this game to... a roller-coaster. It does start out slow, yes, very slow... but after people start placing their second or third star, shit starts coming down like an avalanche.

Just play it, alright!

P.S. I'd recommend an insert for this, lots and lots of little bits and pieces per faction (x5).

P.P.S. One of the greatest things this game has going for it (in my opinion) is that all the miniatures (workers, mechs, leaders) are unique to their respective faction... THAT IS AWESOME! Even if they weren't color-coded you'd still be able to determine which unit belongs to which player... it would be a pain in the ass, sure, but you COULD do it, and I think that's awesome!

One of the most fun, elegantly designed games I've played in a long time, if not ever. Every design decision was carefully thought out, the five (seven with the expansion!) factions are delicately and expertly balanced, and even the most simple actions of improving your action economy are done in such a way as to be fun and interesting. You always feel like you are making a significant decision, and it's always a fun time.

I really enjoy Scythe and am usually happy when my gaming group picks it to play.  Each faction is unique offers a different strategy, although I will say some are clearly more powerful than others.  I enjoy the upgrade and building system, and I think that the theme is fantastic.  The artwork is also a high point, and the game components are high quality.  I find that the strategic choices are varied, and there are many different paths to victory (although not all are created equal...more on that below).  

A few minor gripes.  1) Balancing of factions is not equal.  Certain groups are more powerful than others, and it's not even close.  2) Strategy.  Depending on faction and play mat you can go online and find complex "openings" that essentially take most of the strategy and thought out of the game.  It's almost like Chess where you just pick your first 10+ moves, and then make very minor adjustments based on what your opponents do.  Because of this I find it best to play this game with less hardcore gamers (ie. people who try new strategies and ideas as they go).  Otherwise you end up with very similar games every time if people know these openings.

RATING: 7
Excellent presentation. That's the only feature I'm not conflicted over.
"Upgrading" your personal board is a fun puzzle, but is ultimately shuffling cubes around to construct a dry, game-winning mechanism, rather than building something physically, as well mechanically, pleasing (contrast with, for example, Farmers of the Moor).
It's good that you have to consider what the other players are doing on the map. However, trying to disrupt their system and prevent them disrupting yours is more annoying than fun sometimes.
I wouldn't want to play with five players again as the time between turns is too much.

One of the most visually stunning games ever produced, it broke from the norm by having the gameplay inspired by the artwork rather than the other way around. There was always the risk that this would be a case of style over substance but it is absolutely not the case, it's a deep and rewarding resource management game that isn't as combat focused as it might appear.

First play through (not my copy but a buddy's): 2 player is probably the weakest game play due to minimal interaction. Quick game overall that looks fairly intimidating with the rule book and components but is actually really easy to play. Set up is a bit of a process but should be easy with each play through. Appears no reason to end the game, although I discovered you can sort of force the issue. Quick game even for 3-5 players.

Giocato 25 volte il "base" e già 13 volte l'espansione "...Afar".  Giocato in tutte le maniere con qualsiasi numero di giocatori (anche con 1 o 2 Automas e 1, 2 o 3 giocatori). L'unico modo inopportuno di giocarci è con l'Automa in più di 3 giocatori (viene sbilanciato); per il resto il gioco gira sempre bene. Grande produzione!

NOTA: condizione essenziale per poter giocare con l'Automa in modo equilibrato è che lui deve essere il più possibile equidistante da tutti i giocatori; il che significa che PRIMA si sceglie l'Automa e poi, di conseguenza, si scelgono le fazioni.

Played it once in two players.

It is not a bad game per se, it is bad for what you expect. 
I don't mind an accounting game, where I have to optimize the production of some nameless token, but when it is dressed like a wargame it really makes me mad!

Everything in this game feels like you are doing it just for the sake of it. Usually, one has an objective and he can use different game mechanics (strategies?) to achieve it. For example, let us assume that one has to conquer as many territories as possible. Then one recruits workers, in order to gain resources, then uses the resources to produce mech units and deploy troops, this units are then used to fight. Once the combat is won, one conquer the land and gets the victory.
Not in this game! Here you recruit workers because it is a winning condition. You deploy mech units because it is a winning condition, you enlist troops because it is a winning condition. When you have your big army you can.. ops no, you can't because the game is over and you already have enough points to win simply having your units there doing nothing.

Also: money as points?  Really? In a game with farmers and badass steam punk mech units on the cover, your goal is to gain as much gold as possible? The ultimate goal of your empire is money? Are you kidding me?

A total let down.

Pro:
The art and the miniatures are very nice. 
The game flows rapidly.

I don't think this is a game you play to win, it's a game you play to..... play. The player interaction is shallow, and while you'll get a bunch of combinations of stuff it'll probably end up on rails in the end. 

Amazing concepts, just not particularly competitive. A variable game board or something probably would help it a lot.

Update after three plays: solid resource management game. Catan on steroids actually. Player powers unbalanced and I still don't understand why there are these limiting movement rules, see below. This game is not bad, but there are many better games around.

After one play of this over-hyped game:
- Gloomy dark artwork, not much contrast. Not very functional. Ameritrashers have seen this so often, but Euro players are used to higher standards of bright colours and good contrast between them instead of varing shades of black.
- The map is supposed to show us Eastern Europe. Shouldn't the artist perhaps have taken a look at the actual geography of Eastern Europe, before he started drawing? 
- During the game most counter-intuitive is the movement action. You're extremely limited. Some parts of the map I couldn't go to, even though I had developed all of my movement tricks through mechs. After crossing rivers I could only enter into two types of land. Why so rigid, why so inflexible?  
- Having said all that, what remains is a solid game. A mix of known mechanisms put together in a new game. A race to get 6 stars for 6 targets you're working on. Resource production and conversion as we know it from many euro's is quite straightforward. A bit of fighting added to that. I want to explore this game more.

But "lots of interactive" will need a lot more plays to make up my mind

Liked my first two plays, need to play more to see if I want to buy this. The game looks great, rules are less complicated than it appears at first sight, it all flows nicely.
Theme is a bit weird, and combat and mechs don't seem to have that much influence at all, which is a bit strange. And it's got a couple of weird rules. Like you can only cross water one way. To certain regions where you can produce stuff. But only those...

Beautifully balanced and multifaceted asymmetrical Euro with an epic sense of scale.

Still need to get more people at the table for it to see how it plays with more map tensions/chaos.

Update: dropped score to 7.5 I don't know. Game feels rote despite the variety of tasks, there aren't really that many different roads to success. 

Update again: dropped down to a 7 as I realize that I find the other 7.5s to be a bit superior.  This is an imperfect art, game rating.

Much more enjoyable on my second playing. I felt much more in control of the experience, and didn't get my bum handed to me.

RATING: 10
This game looks complicated and takes a while to explain, my group took about an hour before we were ready to even start the game. However, once we actually got into the game, it was pretty easy to follow. You only have the choice of moving your action selection pawn between four areas and (unless your character ability says otherwise) you cannot choose the area you chose last turn, making turns both fast and relatively simple.

Not that there isn't a lot of things to consider. Each player board comes with a differently distributed set of costs and rewards for each actions, meaning one player benefits more or pays less to put out mechs, while another can more easily put out buildings. Each board also gives the player options on ways to upgrade their actions to gain better benefits and reduce costs, giving you plenty of choices in what strategy you want to play.

What initially made me unsure of the game before trying it was that it looked like it could be combat heavy, but combat actually plays a surprisingly little role in the game. There are combat-related goals, but as you lose popularity for invading hexes with opponent pieces and have to spend power to fight the other players - both of which are not that easily earned in the game - and there are also goals rewarding you if you manage to max out those stats - you find yourself only rarely engaging other players in battle, which puts the focus more on solving the puzzle on how to make your randomly dealt player board work for you, which is what I enjoy the most.

Definitely a fantastic game, I highly recommend it.

For all the bluster and praise spewing out about this game I expected a helluva lot more than a Terra Mystica clone.  The combat is only good to score a point or two, the highly touted art is just present on some throwaway cards, and the plastic is ugly.  The board is difficult to read and the downtime unpleasant.  You have to collect these to turn into those so you can place that, like so many other games.  The asymmetry is present, but essentially everyone is heading towards the same thing and you get essentially the same endpoints, and since you spend the vast majority of the time doing things in vacuum, the assymetry is lost.  No, I don't see what the hype is all about, and I fully expect thsi game to fall into obscurity within a couple years.

After this and Viticulture, I've tabbed Jamey Stegmaier as the "conventional designer." Scythe is a smooth, streamlined euro. I suppose I wouldn't turn it down but I would never suggest it either, because I play games for the excitement of conflict and the original ideas. And what great ideas this could've had, with its evocative art and imaginative world! The potential for world building through unique mechanics! In the end, Scythe is just a run of the mill engine builder & area control game. I wish they had chosen some boring Medival farming theme for this, so I can see a different, great game attached to the great art.

Straightforward engine building with a lot of extra flavor.  Play is intuitive and fairly brisk for such a large game, but games can still run long.  Combat is simple and quickly resolved.  Starts out quiet and solitary but becomes more interactive as time runs out.  Still has the table politics and "kingmaking" issues found in similar games despite it's Euro game framework.  Solo play very cleverly approximates human opponents.

Only one play so far, but I really enjoyed it.  As such, I wouldn't be surprised if my rating goes down after a few plays - after all, it's hard to go up from where my initial feel is.

The mechanisms for each action seem disjoint - but as they're separate and self-contained, means that it's easy to teach and learn as you go.  The actions mesh together into a pretty good emergent system.  Play goes at a fairly good clip, with very little downtime between turns.  I really enjoyed that the combat resulted in an arms race, in which you were vulnerable if you didn't build up, but had to sacrifice some of your economy to build to where you could defend.

the game looks amazing but gameplay was really dull and uninspiring. 
combat costs more than you will gain, so half way thru the game when everything is divided and what not we felt we had nothing to do. 
the random encounters were a cool idea but in the end you see that every card is the same with just a bit different text. the effects were basically identical regardless of the scenario on the card. 
felt tacked on.

sold it after one play coz noone in our group enjoyed the experience.

Would like to play but trying to avoid buying miniatures games since I dislike when they become arguments in favor of quality or cost of a game. Did not see anything to really convince me otherwise in Joel Eddy's overview video from Gen Con 2015.

Update:
Got to play it yesterday (October 2016). I like the base mechanics of player boards and upgrades which is similar to Terra Mystica. I really did not like so much the way in which events and particularly the factory cards break the implicit economics. I could get mechs for 4 metal (later 2) and buildings for 4 wood (later 2) but one player could get a building or a mech for one heart! To make matters worse, he did not even come close to winning. Both getting an insane board position out of nothing (ignoring the normal effort that it takes to build stuff) and then not winning felt really strange. I do not expect that further plays will change this.
Moreover, there are way too many adjacency effects through tunnels and extra abilities and tracing who could go where is quite annoying. It always seemed like everyone else could be everywhere all the time...

Great immersive universe, very nice components, and great mechanics ! 
2 hours of playing for all three plays done, with 5 players each (really fast for this type of 4x game). All the plays were very different, for the last one the winner did'nt deploy any mech... I'm impatient to play again, and to try it at 7 players with the expansion.
Seems to be harder to win with the black faction... but it depends on the action board; we'll see !

One of the best games I've ever played! The replayability is simply astounding! There are five different factions (seven with the expansion) and five different player mats (seven with the expansion), making 25 possible combinations (49 if with the expansion)! There are so many options and ways to win in the game. You can concentrate on getting buildings, recruits or more workers, become more popular (Popularity is a type of "currency" in the game) or you can try to upgrade everything in order to make your economy more profitable so that everything will cost less and give you more. Or you can concentrate on your army, become more powerful (power is a type of "currency" in the game) and try to dominate more areas. For those seeking a war game with miniatures - which is actually why I bought the game in the first place - this might not be the game for you since combat is pretty rare in Scythe and the mechs are used rather to threaten your opponents and try to keep them away from you.
The feat that you store your resources on the board and that players can steal them is pretty neat and also rather realistic.
It is a complex game but once you played it, it should become relatively simple to play. Playing it with two players ins't too exciting since both players get to control nearly half of the board so I'd recommend using at least three players (I haven't yet played the single player variant, so I can't really say anything about it).
All in all, a very admirable and entertaining game where making choices takes up a big part of the game and with excellent, good quality, super detailed miniatures which make the game all the more intriguing. A must-have for people who love slightly complicated board games!

First, the art is awesome, and just like an attraction between humans it is the hotness that starts a draw. Game play was smooth and exciting as the story began to unfold. The use of encounter cards helped to deepen the relationship. As time moved on and we started building our realms the bond became strained as we fought for a foothold during our first arguments. Ultimately this game is more beautiful the more we played. Even its flaws were overshadowed by depth of gameplay and the mutual appreciation for world domination, and I didn't even win the first game.

Jakub Rosalski steampunk témájú festmény kiállítására ráhúzott gazdasági-harci-stratégiai eurós játékként is értelmezhető a Stegmaier tervezőasztaláról kikerült sikerjáték.

Az egyedi tematika a játék minden komponensén visszaköszön: gyönyörű festmények a találkozás kártyákon, játékostáblákon, a miniken a harcosok mellett hol egy pézsmatulok, óriás medve, vagy egy farkas... És még a munkások is máshogy néznek ki minden klánnál.

Gyorsan beszippant a téma, amit nagyon jól kiszolgál a kiválóan működő mechanikája is, ami különösképpen a termelésnél sikerült egyedire (amit termelünk, "kint" marad a térképen, nem kerül központi raktárba, azaz felhasználásig az ellenfél által eltulajdonítható, ha lerohanja az adott tartományt). Nem csak az artwork egyedi tehát, hanem mechanikában is tud olyat mutatni, amit más játékban eddig még nem "használt el" senki.

Első olvasatra nem tűnik rövidnek a játékszabályzata, de tulajdonképpen minden logikus benne, egyszer kell végigmenni rajta + első játéknál néha-néha előkapni a szabályzatot és onnantól már nincs vele gond. Segíti a tanulási folyamatot a jól átlátható és gyorsan felfogható ikonrendszere (pl. a játékostáblán a zöld kockák - előnyök, amiket mi kapunk, piros kockák - amit nekünk kell fizetni).

A játék összetettségét és stratégiai mélységét jól mutatja, hogy simán lehet egyetlen megnyert harc nélkül is végső győzelmet szerezni benne, ha olyan virágzó gazdaságot építünk ki, amivel a többiek fölé tudunk nőni. Előnye mellett talán ez is az egyik hátránya: elég lelombozó maga a harc egyszerűsége, ami igazából elég gyakran egyik játékosnak sem érdeke. Emiatt sokszor csak "kerülgetés" és erődemonstráció van, mert az esetek többségében egyszerűen nem érdemes nekimenni a másiknak. Ha hozzátesszük, hogy a vesztes fél sem bukik akkorát - csupán visszakerülnek egységei a bázisra -, akkor meg duplán elgondolkozik minden klán vezetője, hogy akar-e némi hajtépést a tábla közepén.

A találkozások és a célkártyák nélkül is simán elmenne a játék, de némi színezés gondolom még ráfért, nem akart Stegmaier annyira szárazat alkotni. Így meg fel tudott használni még több mint 50 Rosalski festményt a játékhoz. Remélem a lengyel csávó a festmények darabszáma alapján adta el a jogokat és most már milliárdos...

Erősen javasolt kategória, mert a kicsit gyengébb harcrendszeren kívül nem sok minden más negatívumot tudnék mondani ellene. (Még mielőtt valaki félreérti: a steampunk festmények használata bőven a pozitívumok számát növeli.)

Valószínűleg soha nem lesz a top3-ban, de hogy sokáig az egyik etalon marad a 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) játékok kategóriájában, abban biztos vagyok.

!!!SPOILER!!!
Első játék után érdemes közösen a játékostársakkal rácsodálkoznunk a térképen elrejtett Télapóra, Loch Ness-i szörnyre, vagy Piroskára és a farkasra. "Priceless", ahogy a wall street-i bankárok mondanák.

For the first few playthoughs of this game I wasn't sure what I thought of it.  As I've played it more, I've really grown to love it.  It's important to recognize what it is and what it is not - if you want a game that has a lot of direct conflict between players you won't enjoy this as much as it's mostly about building an economy.  But, if you like epic grand strategy games and want to play a game that does NOT have a lot of direct combat, Scythe is a great game.  

That said, each game is truly different and the powers really matter - often, your goal in this game is trying to find a way to maximize your power's specific advantages.  Sometimes that involves direct conflict.  

The game really plays best with at least 4 players.  However, I still am not sure how balanced it is between players.

the hipsters and bed-wetters have been convinced by a clever marketting campaign and overblown artwork that this is the best 4X game ever made. 

Truth is, Scythe is a dull engine building game who's only novelty is the asymmetric faction powers. There is not enough flexibility to engage my mind, nor enough options for creative play. 

the artwork is well illustrated but unfortunately makes the game harder to play.

As for the theme: sticking a few plastic mechs in the box is not enough. One just ends up doing action after action in pursuit of gold stars. WTF has that to do with the theme?

RATING: 8.7
With family visiting to entertain the Little Fish I managed to get away to a full day of one of our local open gaming sessions. At this session I collected my copy of Scythe from the KickStarter cabal opened it up and set up and played immediately. 

My initial impression of the game is very positive. The components (I, of course, elected to back the deluxe version) are simply magnificent. Wonderful production values throughout with lovely evocative art, perfectly produced plastic miniatures (top marks for a first try at producing miniatures making the efforts of Treefrog Games with Moongha Invaders: Mad Scientists and Atomic Monsters Attack the Earth! look all the more shoddy) and the metal coins really do enhance the playing experience.

The gameplay of Scythe is also great - plenty of meaningful decision as well as the challenge of leveraging each faction's advantages and negating, as far as possible, their weaknesses. The way the player boards work also suggest there is plenty of replayability and this one will be a game that hits the table with regularity. 

I thought that Stonemaier Games was pretty cocksure putting an expansion (Scythe: Invaders from Afar) into development before the base game itself had been released but as far as I am concerned their faith in their product is more than justified and I will almost certainly be picking this one up when it becomes available. Top marks.

UPDATE:

I have played this with two and it's not the greatest. Needs more for it to really shine.

This is a game of small steps and incremental advantages.  I'm worried that the way the scoring system is balanced, one's choices matter very little: everything gives a tiny advantage and pushes you a little bit towards more stars, or more hexes, or more resources. My first impression is that the game is solid, but not great.  

Also, the art and theme didn't quite connect with me.  The art is fantastic, but it evoked a kind of grim realism that I didn't find fun. Finally, the personal nature of the encounters took me right out of the game.

Scythe mashes together a bunch of mechanics and systems from other games as various routes to victory points. Although not entirely unique, it works. A little worker placement, a few elements of 4x, a bit of dudes-on-a-map. It's undeniably beautiful and I'm very intrigued by the theme behind the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I should like this game more than I do.  It has tons of elements that I like: Strategy, worker placement, resource gathering, upgrading, skirmishing.

I guess the entire games seems to be a race to build up ahead of your opponents.  This might be more satisfying if there were an ultimate show down but since that doesn't happen the game just ends.

I've even won this way but it's more of a let down (i built up quickly for this?) than a thrill of victory.

Video Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLR8z1Qy_yg&t=1s

Scythe is for me, a fantastic game. I love how Stonemaier Games rule books are complete but approachable and lead you nicely into the more complex game mechanics. Helpful guides are in all the places you would need them to be meaning that once you have read the rules, the double sided single sheet quick guide will be all you need to refer to for most situations.

It's hard to pick out my favourite part of Scythe. The open ended routes to victory certainly appeal to my style of play, but what nudges it for me is the player and action selection boards which work together brilliantly. The action selection method contained here and the way you can improve and upgrade these is a great feeling.

The actions you choose then play out on the main board where you will deploy mechs, workers and buildings in an effort to make progress towards achieving 6 of a possible 10 star options.

There are some niggles but it's hard to see how they could be avoided. There is a set up and tear down time to take into account and the game can drag with certain types of player. But ultimately these don't detract from what I think is a wonderful game and experience.

Was lucky enough to take part in the first wave of play tests. Thoroughly enjoyable experience, great to see how game is evolving.

Unless something catastrophic happens, which I seriously doubt, this will be on my immediate buy list. I enjoyed playing so much I am still playing it just to see if it can keep getting better.

I am now eagerly awaiting the KickStarter and seeing what the final components are like based upon the previous SM games.

06/08/16 
Played my first game with the released components. Needless to say quality of components is excellent, we played on the expanded board and it just makes things clearer to see and appear less crowded.

Was a five player game with only one other player haven played the game. After initial talk through of what you can do and what game win conditions were we all started to play ...ended up going to a tie-breaker with both players hitting 82 points, which was funny as I was on the middle popularity points whilst my compatriot managed his popularity better to hit top tier.

I won the tie break conditions ... looking forward to the next play as do not see it losing its edge for some time.

RATING: 7
A functional game that fails to excite me after a few plays. While I understood the euro nature of the game going in, the somewhat deterministic combat and plethora of ways to navigate the map made terrain control and positioning feel frivioulous. The end game typically was triggered by one of the players who let one mech stray from their army blob getting dive-bombed from across the map via the mine system for an easy last star made the ending feel anticlimactic, as the players focused on their own optimization more than the threat of violence. Combat only happened a handful of times during the game, and only when the attacker was essentially sure if victory. Unfortunately, the euro-churning optimization clearly deliniated who was the most efficient with their production and spending opportunities, and while that is fine, it doesn't leave a strong impression on me. Beautiful production and solid mechanisms make for a standard euro style game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Simply put my favourite game. Pimped out with all the extras (resources, coins and bigger board) and even with the Broken Token insert for quick setup (needs gluing in a couple of places though).

It's a great engine-builder/area control/farming (yes I know!) game that has so much strategy, tactics and depth to it, I doubt I'll tire of it for a long time. I even enjoy the Automa (Solo opponent) mode a great deal.

-THAT ART THOUGH!
-Tension of neighbours and positioning your mechs and workers accordingly

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-You don't care what your opponent's are doing until late in the game (less players = later)
-Don't really have the freedom to pursue what you want

This game is harder to teach than I initially thought, even though the game itself isn't that complex. This makes me feel like the game isn't "meaty" enough relative to the amount of rules it's got.

Now first things first: the game doesn't feel like I thought/wanted it to feel. It's a race, and you better not screw up too many times or you'll never succeed. It's hard to score a ton of points out of nowhere to catch up with the rest, unless you specifically planned for that beforehand.

I would've loved to have more freedom to play how you want to play, not try to abuse your player board as much as possible. I want to be able to win by upgrading my stuff because that feels satisfying, or by building an army of mechs, even though the mat tells me these give me zero gold.

Another (minor) annoyance I have is with regards to the resources. I don't like the fact that you can't hoard these and keep building stuff with it, since what you can build is limited. Sure, you can always spend them for a bit of gold, but it's just not the same (and usually not the most efficient way to play). This makes the resources-on-the-board mechanic kinda meh, which was kinda the idea I really liked about this game and why I wanted to get it over others.

Even though it's not the game I wanted it to be, it certainly allows for some interesting decisions to be made; tension can get very high. But I just don't like games where it just ends up with "Oh, you build your infrastructure in a little more efficient way than I did..." near the end of the game. Ticket to Ride creates the same tension with less than half the rules. It allows the same feelings of racing and "Oh God please don't go there!"

The game gets better with more people, which is always a good sign to me.

I do like the theme and art a lot better in Scythe though, and want to raise the score just for that. However, I just can't bring myself to rank it among other games I like better just cause it looks so good.

TLDR; "A mile wide and an inch deep"

Latest update after 4th play.  Played with 5 - excellent.  Game plays better with more players.  With 3 its an 8.5, with 4 its a 9, and with 5 its a 9.5.  The only thing that is holding it back from a perfect 10 for me, is that I would like a bit more confrontation.  But that is just my opinion, and it might just be that the crowd I play with doesn't seek out conflict.  There is nothing wrong with that, and you certainly can avoid conflict in this game and still win.

This game requires 4 to 5 players to shine (like Wallenstein).  Finally played with 4 and there was a bit more conflict, but still only towards the last third of the game.  The game has a cooler theme and bits than Wallenstein, but Wallenstein has more interaction, tension, excitement and quite honestly fun IMHO.

Where Scythe differs from other games in this genre, is that it focuses heavily on building up your own resource engine in the first half of the game, to prepare for a "potential" conflict in the second half of the game.  Where in other games of this type, there are definitely battles going on by no later than the  3rd round of play onward, and EVERYONE fights, usually multiple times.

Bottom line is that I like Scythe quite a bit, but I don't believe I will be picking it up because of other games that I have with this type of play style (i.e. Wallenstein, Cyclades, Kemet ..) that I like as much, if not more.

Was very hesitant about this game. The hype train was crazy, and to be the map board looked a mess, and it was static: I was worried that this would hurt the replayability. Happy to say I was wrong. There's a lot of moving parts, and you're engine building/points salading. The factions have great a-symmetry, and seem to be nicely balanced. I really liked playing this game.

This game, and every games I've played by the same designer, feel like a bunch of tried and tested mechanics thrown into a mixing bowl and cooked into a mundane and boring meal. There's just absolutely zero innovation to be found in there for me. 

If you're new to boardgames and need just one game to get a feel of the mechanics that are out there, I guess it is a good idea to buy Stegmeier games. Otherwise, for every one of his titles, I happen to own something similar in theme and designed with more expertise and originality. 

Dont get me wrong, those games arent -bad-. They are well designed and succeed in being decent pieces of entertainment. Its just not for the boardgame snobs like me :)

Definitely overrated, but still pretty fun.

Scythe doesn't do anything that fresh, but it does combine elements of a lot of other well-known games. Playing this gave me similar vibes to games like Tiny Epic Kingdoms (mostly), Terra Mystica, and Harbour. I found the game fine, but what really bugs me about it is that it suffers from that same forced progression that Euphoria has. The game starts out incredibly slow, but picks up steam as you go along. Both here and in Euphoria, however, I kept asking myself why the game was so slow to begin with. I love a developing arc in games, but not when it takes so long to get going.

Scythe is also begging for more player interaction. One thing I love about Tiny Epic Kingdoms is that, when you take an action, other players can choose to follow that action or gain resources, which makes every decision agonizing. Here, a lot of what you do ends up being "Okay, I'm going to move these guys".......everyone else takes their turn......"Okay, I'm going to produce resources." The downtime is pretty bad unless you're playing with an experienced group, and there isn't nearly as much turn angst here. I feel like if it was designed with this "lead/follow" mechanism included, the game would have been so much better. 

It's just so slow-paced, and it's almost designed with the concept of not letting anyone pull off a nice combo that often. Other than recruiting, which gives you a small bonus for others taking certain actions, this is largely a solitary experience. I do like that this game encourages an almost cold war feel in how you want to guard your workers in case an opponent decides to get nasty, but usually, unless your objectives and/or player boards dictate otherwise, combat isn't worth it.

As for things I like, I do think the components and artwork are astounding. I also really like the lore of the game. Everyone converging on this non-functioning mech factory to compete for resources and dominance is a cool idea, but much like Terra Mystica, I wish that there was at least a little bit of variation in map setups. The encounter cards are interesting as well. Much like Above and Below, you're not getting anything super immersive, but I like that you're given a choice rather than forced to do something based on dice rolls. Having your resources placed on the board is a nice touch as well, because they can be up for grabs if an aggressive player comes along, so you don't want to stockpile too much in any one location.

There are some clever elements to this game, such as how encounters work and how well-organized the player boards are, but ultimately this is a game you're either going to love or hate based on other games from this designer. I liked this more than Euphoria, but I still feel like Viticulture with Tuscany is his magnum opus. I just wish that he would do something fresh-feeling instead of the tired old worker placement being shoehorned into everything with awkward tracks that represent odd things like popularity and knowledge.

I might spend a little more time with this game to see if my opinion improves, but I think that I would rather play Tiny Epic Kingdoms, which covers much of the same ground much faster.

Scythe is a very hyped game and I can understand its appeal to new gamers. From a development perspective, it wipes the floors with older games. The player boards almost play the games for you with indentations that tell you where to place your starting cubes and clear symbols that tell you what happens after upgrades (=removal of cubes). The turns are smooth and streamlined and I particularly like how the next player can start their primary actions while the previous player completes his or her secondary actions, since they won't affect other players. In the unlikely event that you would find yourself bored between turns, the stunning art of the board and the components tell innumerous stories to get absorbed in.

However, the design offers nothing new to the seasoned gamer. You take actions to remove cubes to unlock abilities to remove more cubes until you've finally accomplished enough goals to end the game. The board is big enough for everybody so unless someone wants to be aggressive (which earns victory points but is also costly), each player will be doing his or her own stuff. In fact, my first game saw not a single battle. The game of unlocking abilities is better executed in a game like Hansa Teutonica, where the player keep getting in each others' ways, and this is also true in my preferred Stonemaier game: Euphoria.

I won't turn down an offer to play Scythe and I'll be generous with my rating thanks to the development but every mechanism that can be found here is better implemented elsewhere.

The mechanics are a big mishmash and it's surprisingly difficult to figure out what to do from turn to turn, but I still really like the game.

Played 3 games in total. Game is a bit tricky to understand the rules the first time, especially with the top and bottom actions. Intuitively, you would think that you choose either the top or the bottom action. However, it's actually both. Overall, I find Scythe to be very interesting for at least a few games.

PROS
1. Replayability Factor
There is a small replayability factor with the mixup of Factory Cards, different player boards and 8 different races to play.

2. Interconnected Maps
The tunnels are great at shortening the distance between players, ensuring a fair battleground. Other war games tend to have uneven distances between players.

CONS
1. Railroading
Players tend to be railroaded down a single racial bonus. E.g. Black is a war faction with the ability to keep on gaining stars from battle. It wins if it win more fights. Blue has the ability to use the Lakes, allowing them to win with more map tiles since you can control Lakes. The initial resource distribution also railroads your strategy. E.g. Starting with Metal enables Mechs to appear faster, while starting with Wood allows more buildings to be built. 

2. Enlisting
The rewards for enlistment is limited to only the players on your immediate left and right which makes it sort of luck dependent as you will choose the secondary action that your neighbours play or you will get nothing. This creates a situation where luck matters as you hope that your neighbours give you a reward that is inline with your strategy. 

3. Objectives
It is actually possible to draw 2 objectives that are not inline with your strategy. Like a pacifist card with a war faction.

RATING: 8
"Scythe! Everyone's favourite economic powerhouse hiding behind steam-powered Mechs. It'd be easy to mistake Scythe for a combat based game, however in truth, it's a wonderfully filled engine building game with absolutely miniscule amounts of luck. The whole game depends on your strategy and your ability to make the most of your resources, as you build your empire vying for popularity, military might and economic supremecy. A bit unwieldy at first, Scythe is surprisingly simple and turns actually flow in a matter of seconds once you get going, leaving for little downtime. 

Ranked as the 7th Best Board Game of all time, Scythe won multiple awards including Best Thematic Board Game, Golden Geek Game of The Year award and Best Strategy Game.

Most importantly, it also won Best Artwork 2016. And we can absolutely understand why. This game is absolutely beautiful; every single image is a work of art and worthy of looking through for that reason alone."

RATING: 5.9
Une seule partie jouée (3 joueurs). Je partais avec l'idée que j'allais m'ennuyer en jouant à Scythe. Selon divers commentaires écrits ici sur BGG, le jeu ratissait assez large côté "mécaniques" de jeu, sans nécessairement (bien) les approfondir. Mes lectures m'avaient également mis en garde sur l'aspect "solitaire" du jeu, où les intéractions sont peu nombreuses. Finalement, l'aspect "économique" du jeu, où il s'agit de développer son propre truc (et, au final, de "faire fonctionner le jeu", quoi!?) ne fait pas particulièrement partie de mes préférences.

En y jouant, j'ai effectivement retrouvé un peu tous ces éléments, mais le fait de l'avoir su à l'avance faisait en sorte que mes attentes étaient on ne peut plus basses.  Au final, je donne une note qui est supérieure à ce que je m'attendais à attribuer à ce jeu, mais qui est quelque peu inférieure à ma moyenne des notes attribuées sur BGG. Et je suis loin derrière la "hype" de la communauté, plaçant le jeu actuellement en 8e place, avec une note moyenne de 8.3.

Il est clair pour moi que je ne vois pas trop comment Scythe peut garantir une réelle rejouabilité, sinon bien sûr lors des parties *2, 3, 4... où l'on va tester d'autres plaquettes de jeu. Outre cela, j'ai l'impression qu'il s'agira toujours, hélas, de mettre en marche une machine (d'une manière répétitive d'une partie à l'autre et somme toute monotone) et de la faire fonctionner, avec un minimum d'intéractions réunies sur le plateau central. Un feeling qui s'apparente un peu à celui que j'ai éprouvé en jouant à Myrmes - d'ailleurs j'accorde des notes similaires aux deux jeux. On développe son truc devant soi et à partir d'un moment, une certaine collision peut survenir sur d'autres joueurs - mais bien souvent on est alors presque à la fin de la partie. Ou alors (bien que les deux jeux ne soient pas comparables), un feeling à la 7 Wonders, dans le sens où on ne se préoccupe guère de ce qui se passe à l'autre bout de la table durant 85% du temps.

Par conséquent, je suis bien prêt à redonner à Scythe une deuxième chance (à 4 joueurs), voire une troisième, mais je serais surpris d'en vouloir plus à partir de ce moment. Certainement pas un jeu que je vais vouloir acquérir.

"[COLOR=#003300]Scythe had the problem of "doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff." I don't need my fourth mech, but I need a star, so I'll build one just for that. I don't find that interesting: building a mech should be a big deal, not just a checkmark on your way to 6 stars. Same goes for combat and recruits and structures: I don't really need this thing, but I need the star from it..[/color]" [Daybreak (6)]

"[COLOR=#003300]Scythe has a light amount of interaction, mostly for board position. Yet, for the most part, you will do your thing, the others will do theirs, and rarely one will care to see what you are doing. It will be more an affair of "pass me 3 food", or "raise my popularity by 1", or "I'm building this, here". - Small interaction and even interest in what the other players are doing for most of the time.[/color]" [tiagoVIP (7)]

"[COLOR=#003300]The actions trigger many effects on the game board at the same time, and therefore taking actions feels more like triggering chaos than carefully and orderly expanding.[/color]" [hydra_be (4)]

"[COLOR=#003300]Scythe is an engine-building game that mostly concerns itself with action efficiency questions. There is an interesting action selection system (unless you are the Rosviet Union) but players spend the largest part of the game brooding over their own player boards while the only interaction point is the limited combat (which I generally am a fan of) that is most likely to occur when fighting for the final few VPs.[/color]" [fizzle (5)]

RATING: 10
Plays brilliantly solo and in multiplayer, lavishly produced, gorgeous art, brilliant theme,  can feel a little bit vague with the sudden endgame, and the automa/solo rules have a lot of exceptions to get your head around, but this is an excellent achievement of a game and combines the best of thematic play and Euro mechanics in a similar way to Eclipse, but without all the destruction.  Really combat is so secondary in this game, you barely have the time for it.

Very good production values and game looks great. Mechanically like many expand, gather, build games, and control of areas plus efficient resource production is the key. No real tech tree, just small upgrades possible. Setup seems like it can give geographic advantage to some factions (also depending on their player board and resources needed). Fun to play, end can come quickly but is within player control. Combat is only player interaction but can be important. 
Despite action selection it reminds me most of Nexus Ops perhaps, or Sid Meier's Civ. It's really a race game to achieve objectives.

Rating 7 but may improve.

I'm super happy with this purchase, it was worth every cent.

In an alternate reality 1920's Europe, players are one of five asymmetrical factions, moving units on the board, building mechs, building structures, producing goods, enlisting, upgrading or having encounters. If your mechs or characters meet an opponent, combat is decided by a combat wheel and a card modifier.  The game ends when one player achieves 6 stars, and VPs are counted. Stars are awarded for winning combat, objective cards, building 4 mechs/4 structures/4 enlists and so on.  Your score is modified by your popularity, and  VPs are awarded for stars, controlled territories and resources. You also get VPs for where your structures are located depending on the structure card that is flipped up. 

I like the part about trying to optimize your engine. I'm not overly fond of the combat system, and not too many combats will occur, typically toward the end of the game as people look to get more stars. The game can end with an unequal number of turns for each player, which I don't like either. I know this game is highly rated, but it just doesn't feel precise with all those asymmetrical powers, especially about the turn order.  The tactical element of attacking people is something that doesn't grab me, as it could change what was an economic game into a survival game and you could be unfairly attacked.

Issues in 5p: moderately large downtime with nothing to do, may be alleviated with experienced players but still annoying. I hate blind bids like in this and Tammny Hall, esp for combat, like in TEK too imo. also unconvinced the boards are equallybalanced and dislike the spread of 2-5 for attack cards and how players dont get even turns (i got one less than everyone else).

Engine building and action gains reminded me of the balancing act in Concordia, but I thiink that at least felt faster. I also just dont care for nor like the artwork and it feels weird actually, the wooden pieces and the plastic. Not my cup of tea ultimately imo even though I usually like some hybrids. I suspect 4p experienced would be much more enjoyable but not a fan of the game I played for the most part.

Also huuuuugely long setup and teaching and cleanup semi long too. And quite the table space hog, more than Caverna I think! Or on par at least...

The game seems intimidating at first because there is a large rule book and lots of pieces.  Once you get going though, the rules are all really straight-forward and the cards and game boards do a really good job of explaining what needs to be done.  For the most part my first play was able to be done by going over the mechanics once and just following exactly what is written on the game boards.  They're fairly unambiguous.  Overall I'd say it's a nearly perfect game and was loads of fun.  My group tended to compare it to Twilight Imperium, but the main difference (other than the obvious thematic one) was that Scythe actually seems as though it can be played in an evening.  My group will definitely be going back to Scythe again.

RATING: 2.5
The game is gorgeous, gives a great first impression, and seems much better balanced than I had expected given the asymmetrical starting positions... yet I don't enjoy playing.

The efficiency puzzle feels like it can often be solved before players have a meaningful chance to interact. This becomes even more noticeable if you don't have a full compliment of players at the table. The impression of balance also is false if you don't have enough player interaction to help even out advantages (ie: synergies) that might be randomly awarded at the start of the game.

Every session of this game has left me less impressed. At this point, I would actively avoid playing if given the choice.

Excellent game, although the symbology may be harder to grasp for new players. New players will hardly stand a chance against players who played at least once. Although our mental attention is generally focused at completing objectives to place stars, the real winner is the one with the most cash. Therefore, this game is more of a marathon (steadily making cash) than a race, which also makes it hard to track which player has the lead. The thematic aspects are outstanding and the rulebook is one of the best I've seen so far.

Good, not great. Better than the designer's previous game, Euphoria, but cut from the same cloth. Stegmaier definitely learned from Euphoria and streamlined some of its clunkiness in this new effort. For an Area Control game though, the simplicity of Scythe's combat is on par with Age Of Empires III; an afterthought, and likely won't impress fans of war games.

I detest what Kickstarter has done to board gaming, and Scythe is a prime example of what draws my ire.

This is the most OK game I have ever played. Let me preface this review with this is one of the most gorgeous games to ever be produced, so if your wanting an expensive paper weight this is it. It is for this reason it was so sad to find out there's not much game here, the game is fine. But the mechanics are a bit fiddly, I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. About an hour into one of our plays we realized, it was ok, the next thirty minutes noone was having fun, and by the time the last few turns and scoring came around some people hated it. Combat is the most boring part of the game, but the good news is it hardly ever happens. You quickly learn that the combat is rarely ever worth the effort and resources, so noone engages in it. If your dying for the game, get it. You may enjoy some things about it and worst case you lose a few dollars in a trade. If your on the fence, this is an easy pass on mechanics. There just isn't enough game here. Perhaps my rating is so low due to the fact that is rated 6th game of all time. I wouldn't even put this in the top 200.

Challenging game that you need to keep you head straight when working on a strategy as it may take a dozen turns to see it though.  I can see a number of house rules coming in, firstly a short term score system that at some point early in the game a quick tally of the scores is done so players can see what they are going for to score points (not a surprise ending which newer players will experience).  

I enjoy the solo elements of the game also, finding it a great way to learn the game and be better placed to teach others.  The solo computer is very good indeed at creating a challenging opponent and helping you mould your play style to suit the faction your playing.

An absolutely beautiful game and one that I would like to own. It has less direct conflict than I hoped it would, perhaps needing a smaller board for fewer than 4 players, but unique game play and quick turns makes it one that is worthwhile. The collector's edition is of course ridiculous, but I'd be fine with owning it in just the regular edition.

Love this game. Excellent art/components, and engaging gameplay. My only two criticisms are it's a little bit of a beast to setup/teardown, and it takes a little while to learn how to play. Gameplay is tight, but just a bit more of a start-up speed than I normally look for.

There is very little combat in this game, especially at lower player counts, but it's the *threat* of combat that keeps things interesting. Though in my games I noticed most people focus on their own, and maybe their neighbors mechs, and not people across the board (which makes it easy to get blindsided by them).  

Lower player counts end up more on the euro/multiplayer solitaire end of the scale. Higher player counts ends up on the more interactive end of the scale.

Not a well developed game, the mechanism feels repetitive and clumsy, the gameplay feels like a solitaire, the little player interaction feels somewhat artificial. Another quibble is that the game ends instantly without giving each player the same amount of turns. Why people like and hype this so much is beyond me.

Certain player/board combos just seem way over-powered. I'm sure an advanced player could compensate, but being forced to compensate seems like a disadvantage. Also, the black faction (Saxony), seems vastly under-powered. Sure they can end the game in a surprising way if they were ever ahead in points, but how are they ever going to get ahead in points when they don't have any abilities? The rules say that you get two goal cards for flexibility, but saxony's ability is their inability to be flexible? I guess the strategy with Saxony is hope to get lucky cards and if not resign. Once you're behind there really isn't anything to hope for. It's not like there is something you can do that's going to score you tons of points. Some crazy gamble or perfect opportunity. Instead, you just slowly grind points out of your engine. A bad decision early and you just have a game where you live with regret. These games are supposed to be fun right?

Plays well and fast once the rules and mechanics are understood.   

We came back to this after a few months, and it took a bit to get back into it.  It still plays very well. I think the big board may just be too big for out table - we enjoy more on the smaller board.

The free for all battles have been solved in a brilliant way: limited benefits, attacking workers is punished and the effects for the loser are mild. Battles are resolved using the Dune wheel mechanism. As a result of all this, battles are scarce, they are only fought when the attacker is sure he will win. They are there just to produce a "cold war" effect that will create tension and allow it to rise.

The economic part is definitly there. You need to carefully plan your actions in order to be able to do as much as you can in every turn. This is not as complex as it initially seemed, but it's a nice optimization job that will keep you busy.

Keeping the resources in the playing board is a brilliant and original idea that adds another [minor] layer of tactic depth.

What I found more surprising about Scythe is the game flow. It is quite fluid and we finish our 4-player first game in just 2 hours, after having played many turns each.

There are a couple of things I'm not fully satisfied with:
-> Not many ways to win. For each lower personal board, there are "optimal routes to victory" you can't deviate much from if you want to win. The rest of the stuff, including upper personal boards, just add features and minor modifications to those routes. Yes, even if you repeat with both boards, you won't be able to pull of exactly the same strategy, but it will be very similar.
-> The endgame is a bit anti-climatic. Most of the points will be awarded by area control, everybody will be spreading through the board as much as they can when they sense the end is near. And this is when the "punish the leader" effect will take place: players will tend to attack whomever they consider the strongest player.
-> I probably should not say this because I've only played 4 games, but I suspect that one specific lower board is better than the others (to the point of allowing you to perform 2 actions on almost every turn). I doubled my rivals in score when I played it, and it's not difficult to see why. They key is that all the boards are mathematically neutral, but the combination of the actions is not (some actions are better performed during the first turns, some can wait, some are better at the end...).

My favorite things about the game:

1. The artist, Jakub Rozaiski, is credited with, "world building and art." I love that Stonemaier Games acknowledged the critical role that the artwork plays in making this game so wonderful. Maybe more than any other game I've ever played, the aesthetics matter. This is by no means an indication that the actual gameplay is in any way sub-optimal [GFOP]. It's just that Mr. Rozaiski did, indeed, build an incredibly engaging world. And it absolutely elevates the game.

2. There is a fantastic balance of elements drawn from two totally different gaming traditions. It has all the resource production, chaining, and optimization of your favorite Euro, but with giant, walking war machines that will blow you up and take your stuff. That being said, the game is less about combat, and more about the threat of combat. If you completely ignore the confrontational aspects of the game, you will likely not win. However, as my 14 y/o discovered while playing recently, you can deploy all your mechs, mercilessly harass the other players with your ability to emerge from nearby lakes, drive off their workers without remorse (because of your special exemption from losing popularity for doing so), steal their cache of 7 metal bars, and drag that stack of beautifully-crafted, custom, wooden resource tokens back into the lake to which no other player has access, rubbing your hands together and laughing maniacally, and yet still manage to lose the game spectacularly, and all while having a really great time. 

[Aside]It was such a thoughtful touch to have the game's name reflect this balance.[/Aside]

3. The mixing of unique player boards and faction boards, along with the randomly assigned secret objective cards/factory cards provide a significant degree of replayability.

Drawbacks:

1. There is just no way to teach this game quickly. I've been teaching games for years, and consider myself to be pretty good at it. I wouldn't say that this game is difficult to teach - the actual turn structure is about as straight-forward as it could possibly be. But you just can't take any shortcuts while teaching. Rodney Smith's tutorial is excellent. And I know he puts a ton of work into streamlining his instructional videos. Be he needed every bit of the nearly 33 minutes he used to teach this game.

2. I found that it was really important to ask the players to clearly announce exactly what they were doing, as they were doing it. Because the order of the top-row actions on the various player boards isn't identical, and because of the variability of the costs and benefits of the bottom-row actions, it's really difficult to know exactly what another player is doing simply by watching him place his action token. And because the various factions have unique "unlockable" abilities that dramatically affect movement, it is difficult to keep up with who can go where. Especially when everyone is first learning the game, it's important to "police" one another's turns. This is not only to make sure players don't inadvertently break a rule (Oh, did I walk across a river?), but also to make sure they don't forget to gain a deserved benefit (Oh yeah, I was supposed to get 3 coins when I deployed that mech.) Finally, because the recruitment aspect of the game allows players to benefit when specific actions are taken by the players to their immediate left and right (think: Nefarious + Between Two Cities), it's really important to know what your neighbors are doing. Unless players announce their actions out loud, other players can easily miss possible bonuses while planning their next turns. As someone who HIGHLY encourages player to plan during other players' turns, I don't want to ever see this behavior punished.

Summary:

Get the game and play it. It's fun!

Addendum:

Though I've only tried it a few times, the solo, "Automa," experience is really great. I can easily see this joining the rotation of heavier solo games that I play when I have a free afternoon/evening (when does that ever happen?), along with games like Mage Knight, Robinson Crusoe and Cruel Necessity.

RATING: 7.7
Gran bel gioco destinato a mio avviso ad avere un grande successo perché strizza l'occhio a molti giochi di recente successo come per esempio [thing=120677][/thing]. I materiale dell'edizione kickstarter sono superlativi con monete in metallo, risorse tutte differenti, miniature e quanto di più si possa desiderare. Stride a mio avviso l'abbinamento tra miniature in plastica e risorse/edifici in legno, ma sono veramente dettagli (mi piacerebbe conosce le differenze con il gioco che troveremo in commercio normalmente). Il gioco base esce con 5 differenti schieramenti asimmetrici, con poteri differenti, che si sfidano per lo sviluppo e per il controllo del territorio. Il tabellone illustra già la possibilità di espandere a 7 il numero dei giocatori. Proprio il tabellone determina l'andamento della partita con un territorio troppo vasto in pochi giocatori, e tremendamente affollato in 5 giocatori, questo a beneficio di un'interazione che diverrà sempre più forte. L'obiettivo del gioco è quello di meglio svilupparsi in popolarità, forza militare, sfruttare il territorio per edificare o costruire le proprie armate. I tanti aspetti da tenere sotto controllo e da analizzare rendono a il gioco profondo e longevo. Le partite iniziano in sordina, a rilento, in attesa che i giocatori costruiscano il proprio motore che sarà alla base della propria strategia. Gioco da riprovare ma per il momento, dopo avermi lasciato col fiato sospeso per tutta la partita, mi ha lasciato un dolce sapore.

I am yet to play with people who are not first time players, but the few times that I have played to far was fun. Once you get your head around how to read the player boards and figure out how to use it, the game goes smoothly and at time blindingly fast.

Pleasant, if entirely over-hyped, 4X game. The whimsical encounters are fun but not exactly conducive to proper planning, and there seems to be a distinct lack of replayability once you've played the races. But the battle mechanic is definitely preferable to chucking dice about, and the art and theme works pretty well for those who want to storytell.

Special edition. Very nice 4X game, highly variable setup and yet simple to learn. Not quite sure how it will stand repeat plays - rated 7.5 (July'16) but that could go +/-2

Credit to Joe Wyka for articulating my reservations about this game:
"The artwork and production quality for Scythe are an absolute 10. They make you want this game to live up to the unique vision presented by Rozalski's epic paintings. You want to dominate the landscape and win the hearts of the workers! However, each time I played this month I became more and more aware of the disconnect between the incredible thematic art and the game's objectives and mechanics. This is not an epic experience game that tells the great story it promises, it is an efficiency engine game that is entirely focused on action-improvement, in which you win primarily by maximizing each category of efficiency faster than the other players. You work to get workers, buildings and mechs onto the board to do... what? Spread out? The problem is that simply getting them on the board IS the objective for most of the game. Once you get them all out, the game is pretty close to finishing.

Encounters are another vivid example of the thematic and mechanical disconnect inherent throughout the design. The artwork on the encounter cards is frankly the best part of the game. The art is so good, there is no text describing the encounter. Jamey wisely lets the art speak for itself. The cards present three moral choices: one benign, one opportunistic, and one exploitative. In a game that presents the juxtaposition of military and pastoral in such vivid illustrations, I want my moral decisions to shape my destiny - to define who I am - as a leader. Encounters present a great opportunity to accomplish this, but bafflingly work directly against the theme instead. There is no lasting effect of your moral choice. The cards then become anti-thematic and entirely mechanical. You are going to make the choice that makes immediate mechanical sense for your efficiency engine and discard it, rendering the implications of the moral decision utterly meaningless! Why set up the promise of a moral decision with no lasting moral impacts?? Why not design these cards to give an ongoing effect that reflects your decisions as a leader?

Objective cards also miss the mark. What is significant about grouping pieces in a certain way or stockpiling resources for no purpose? Building goals like building all of your buildings in a straight line only serve to remind us just how arbitrary and disconnected these goals are from the brilliant 1920's post-apocalyptic setting."

This^ is absolutely spot-on. Scythe is an excellent [i]efficiency engine[/i] game and has superb art and components. I still rate it somewhere between a 7 and 8. Thematic objective cards would be the simplest improvement.

The gameplay is pretty simple.
The problem I have with this game is overall with theme and the "Sci-Fi"-kind of miniatures. Allthough it is nicely designed.
Through the game I had the feeling, that everyone is doing his thing, as long as there are no battles, there is no to little interaction.

I agonised for months before I got this game. Was it just a load of hype from Kickstarter backers that pushed this game into the top 10? Emperor's new clothes? Were the nay-sayers correct? After my first play I thought it was ok but no way did it live up to what I was hoping for. It felt like just a moderately interesting Euro (and I like Euros). I'd much rather be playing something like El Grande.

On second play with the rules now imprinted in my brain something changed. We were sucked into this game and didn't want to come out. An excellent game which I cannot wait to play again. If you like deep and thinky with slow burning tension this is for you.

RATING: 10
Scythe...how do I love thee. Let me count the ways:

Can we start with the ridiculous artwork? Absolutely gorgeous! Thankfully, there's an amazing game beneath the art as well. I like the replayability and variability inherent in the setup with the player boards. It's amazing to me what is achieved with 4 basic actions.

The encounter cards can be pretty powerful, which is a way to get a nice boon towards victory. So, even though it's a lesser element of the game play, they can be exploited to good use if players are clever in grabbing them.

And I don't know why, but the simple fact that resources stay *on the board* feels like such an ingenuity in gaming. There is a lot to appreciate in that; it keeps the players' area decluttered. And speaking of the resources, the production quality is great. And the mechs are well-made; the characters (with their spirit animals) are super cool.

I could go on and on, but instead I wrote a lengthy review about why I feel like Scythe serves as a milestone in gaming.

Apart from the hype and great artwork / setting, - and having played only two times so far - I find Scythe to actually be a rather dull worker placement game with unnecessarily (as in "not adding fun") complex mechanics. Also, with the different faction board characteristics, it feels like the game is playing you, not like you are playing the game and THAT I think is bad game design. 

Once you worked yourself through the thicket of the complexity and understand what is required to win the game, you basically have a given recipe lying in front of you (in form of your faction board) that you "simply" need to follow as closely as possible and just avoid mistakes by deviating from it. This - apart from the limited interactions with other players on the gameboard - leaves you with very little freedom for strategic or tactical choices. Any deviation from the game's/faction's plan for you just puts you at a disadvantage vs. players who just follow the plan by (ab)using their factions advantages and avoiding the disadvantages. One wrongly placed cube will lose you the game vs. a player who knows it well. In that way it is a bit like tic-tac-toe...

Initial impressions of this game confirm what I feared based on reports from others who have played it: This game is firmly in the Eurogame mold, with the main emphasis being on developing an action-efficient resource engine. Although this is not a bad thing in itself (in fact, it is done rather well here), the main problem for me stems from the fact that this game has practically no player interaction. Every time I've played this game, nobody saw a convincing reason to attack anyone else because the winner actually stands to lose more in combat than the loser!

In conclusion, if you like Eurogames that emphasize action efficiency and engine building, you will probably like this game. If you like games with heavy player interaction, this game is almost certainly not for you. Since I fall into the latter category, I have sold this game.

Un de mes jeux favori du moment.
J'ai abordé ce jeu volontairement "à l'aveuglette" : avant de commencer ma première partie, je ne me suis absolument pas documenté sur le jeu pour une découverte totale. Résultat : j'ai pris une grosse claque ludique! Le thème est sympa bien que pas vraiment transcendant. Les illustrations et style graphique sont beaux. Côté mécanique, je pensais qu'il s'agissait d'un 4X mais il s'agirait plutôt d'un 3,5X car la partie combat (eXtermination) est très "light". Et je pense que c'est à peu près tout ce qu'on pourrait lui reprocher.
Les règles sont bien pensées et relativement accessibles. Une fois que l'on a compris la synergie qu'il peut y avoir avec l'utilisation de son plateau (plateau au top avec les petits renforcements) de joueur c'est un vrai régal que d'opérer cette gymnastique. C'est tellement cohérent que jouer à Scythe provoque un sentiment de satisfaction même si on ne gagne pas la partie.
Pour s'en sortir le jeu nous oblige à développer un peu mais pas n'importe comment.
La différence entre les classes peut orienter les joueurs et ce n'est pas plus mal car cela pousse à voir d'autres optiques de jeux (être plus agressifs dans les prochaines partie ou plus populaire par exemple).
Pour ma part je n'ai pas trop utilisé les Mechas mais bon, à voir comment jouer mes adversaires, ils apportent un atout majeur au jeu de toute évidence !
Que du bonheur, ma prochaine partie me tarde déjà !

RATING: 8.75
With about 10 games under my belt, I'm upping my rating. I still want to play all the time, still willing to teach it, still thoroughly enjoying each game.

The biggest gripe I have, and this is consistent with most engine builders, is the snowball effect: the game can ends too soon! You just put in an hour+ work into finally creating a reasonable engine and strategy, and just before you get to use it suddenly all the stars are being placed and boom! it's over. Not a huge complaint, I still love this game.

Update: have probably played ~15 times now and I would still play it whenever anyone wants to. Have yet to do the single player vs automata. Top 2 game currently (Terra Mystica being the #1)

Update:
The end-game snowball effect is unfortunately not fixed with the latest expansion, though I do love the airships. Ultimately, I think that the luster of this game is wearing a little thin for me. Still In my top 5, still would play it almost any time... but soon I might have to make house rules to fix the "bugs".

RATING: 7
After first play: I found it better than I had expected. There was so much going on the board! A bit of exploration, a bit King-of-the-Hill, a bit of technical advancements... On the spectrum of Euro-Ameritrash hybrids, is it rather on the Euro side in my perception, somewhere between Cyclades and Clash of Cultures, maybe? In spite of all the fighting, it is not as aggressive as Kemet or even Eclipse (with which it seems to have a lot in common, especially the manipulation of the individual tableau, but not the game feeling!). It is an optimizer for sure, with strikingly elaborate mechanisms. And why is it an optimizer? What is the qualitative difference to a 4x not knotted for Victory Point optimization? Very simple: Intuitive game does not work! You can occupy an opponent's building as you wish, even right in front of his door, but instead of being rewarded for it, you may be punished for the stupidity of chasing away a peasant. WTF?! Well, you just have to accept, or, as I recently read, "Before I get upset, I rather don't care," because this stupid circumstance does not alter the fact that I have not bored myself in this game for a second. It also has strikingly little downtime. However, other than Twilight Struggle, or Fury of Dracula, this would not be a game for which I would leave everything behind.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Another game I need to play again before really nailing down my opinion/rating. After one play I'm not buying into the hype, I thought the game was good but not as earth shattering as people make it sound. The theme and artwork is excellent (well minus the board itself in which all the colors seem over saturated and it ends up looking somewhat garrish). I'm not sure that I enjoyed the race element to the game, I much prefer a game that has a set number of rounds or an end game condition that you see coming. Spending time developing a strategy only to have someone rush the end of the game doesn't appeal to me, even if that person doesn't win you still don't get to see what you were working towards come to fruition. 

I'm also not sure I like how combat is handled, if you're going to have combat in a game I want to fight. I'm not nearly as interested in using the threat of force to protect my resources and only engage in a handful of battles throughout the game. In the end I thought I'd love this Scythe and was convinced I buy a copy after I played, but for now I'm content playing when I get the chance. And while I understand the superficial comparisons to Terra Mystica it doesn't hold a candle to that game. Scythe is much more straight forward and far less demanding, and in my opinion, less interesting to play.[/i]

Has a lot of cool elements and I can definitely see the rating going up as I play more.  I like how there's a lot of ways to attack like Kemet.  However combat can be costly if you spend a lot but don't win, so you need to be judicial with it.  We messed up a lot of rules in our first game so the next time my opinion might change a lot if we get it correct right off the bat.

The game has interesting mechanics but suffers from severe ludo-narrative dissonance.

Incredible theming/worldbuilding/art, and an experience building up your empire that's generally fun regardless of the final standings.

RATING: 9
Probably one of the most hyped games in recent memory, thanks mostly to its fantastic artwork and quality design. There's been much said about the game itself, but not from someone who doesn't have a particularly interest in 4x, all-out war games. Scythe is a thematic engine-building Euro with some direct player-to-player action in the form of combat. The focus of the game isn't total domination and extermination of your enemies; it's the harvest of resources and protection of units. Mechanics are borrowed from typical 4x games (tech trees, specialized units, a sprawling map) as well as the best VP-obsessed Euros (resource-gathering from Agricola, single-action turns from Terra Mystica and others). For myself, I was hypnotized by the beautiful artwork and thematic material from the game, but as soon as I saw the hexes on the Kickstarter page, prepared myself for disappointment; I'm just not that kind of gamer. After playing however (first with two, then with four), I've found myself wondering whether I could withstand the strain of a typical 4x game. Maybe it's not complicated or long for me. For the present, the tension of Scythe is enough to sustain and build my courage up for Twilight Imperium. Every aspect of this game is brilliant: the replay-ability (the various factions combined with the specific player mats), the quality of the components (coins, meeples, miniatures), the artwork, the overall flow of the game, even the storage was meticulously designed and executed. I'll be having Scythe as a proud part of my collection for some time. Can't wait to play again.

I considered buying this game, but the bizarre alternative history theme is too weird for me.  It doesn't help that I am not a miniatures fan, either.  The art is interesting, but at first glance, it looks like someone spewed all over the board.

This is one of the most balanced advanced strategy games i've ever played! The way the in-depth game mechanics works together with the streamlined gameplay actions gives you a fluent and constant flow of the game. Turns goes by surprisingly quick, considering the complex consequences of your options, and it really gives a perfect balance to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Engaging, but rather laborious to play - so many little turns are required to gradually eke out your engine, making it more of a labour than a labour of love. The decisions along the way centre around planning a number of turns ahead and doing everything in the right order to save as many turns as possible. The more efficiently you can play, the faster you'll earn your VP conditions. So you're engaged throughout in the challenge to be as efficient as possible, which is one type of gaming reward, but there weren't many laughs along the way. Having played once, I'm not overly itching to go through it all again. I can admire it and rate it for being good at what it does for the times that I'm in the mood for that kind of thing - it's just not something that will pull me back to the table in and of itself.

It's a decent game, it just doesn't have as much player interaction as I would like. Increase the combat options and decrease the resource-gathering. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game... but it feels like a missed opportunity when the artwork and alt-history are dripping with theme but the game itself is just a generic point salad. Hint for Jamey: make a wargame in the Scythe universe and now you've got something special!

RATING: 10
I'm amused at what this game is not. Scythe is purely not a worker placement, not a 4X game, not a war-game, not a race to 6 stars/objectives, not an engine-builder, not an area control game, not a trading-in-the-Mediterranean game, not a resource management game. . . , YET, it has a wonderful blend of all of it!! Even the stuff I'm not fond of (i.e. area contol), I love in this game!

Yup! This game hits me just right! Once you start playing, things start clicking. The theme shines through without being annoying, mostly because of the beautiful artwork and the thoughtful alternate-historical details. Learning curve, but an engaging one I hope. Much replayability. Games can go fast once players know what's going on. Perhaps some downtime, thus AP alert, but this can help when people need the off-time to figure out their plans. Many strategic and tactical decisions. Very decent 2-player, but the game changes a bit as the board fills up more with more players.

Reminds me a little of Nexus Ops and Antike. I don't believe it's as heavy as people say. Though people are complaining that the starting conditions for each player spoon-feed you on the strategy you need to follow, I don't feel that to be a negative for me because I still need to work any strategy around what others are doing in order to win; that is, I'm still using my brain and creativity, and still having fun. 

I can't wait to try out the Automa, and the expansion(s).

Only played once. I love the combat (hidden power wheel and partial knowledge) but we didn't get to see too much of that in our game. The player boards were great out of the box, the minis were superb.

RATING: 1
Disappointed. Played one two player game. Definitely overhyped. I was hesitant to buy another Stegmaier game based on my very negative reaction to Euphoria (again, too much chrome, not enough game) but this is slightly better than Euphoria. Components and art are great but quality control is not. Broken meeple, various scuffed and dented mats, cards with bent corners. Will give it a few more plays. Hopefully better with more players.

The best part to me were the hidden encounter cards and the art on them. I couldn't care less about plastic minis.  It's very disappointing to see the general gaming public reacting with such fervor to Ameritrash toys/gimmicks like this.  This game would sit nowhere near its current ranking if the minis were blocks of wood of varying colors. 

Decisions were too obvious, too simple, and repetitive. Make resources, buy stuff, repeat. Game drags. Too long. Speeding up play by doing your bottom row action while opponent starts their turn didn't work either. The first thing my opponent said when I tried to speed up the game this way, was "I'll wait. I want to see what you're doing."  There was only one time where I had to think twice about something and that was a rare attack situation. Otherwise, we're playing solitaire. 

I did not like how easy it was to accumulate combat cards when you got the enlist actions going, especially considering that battles are very infrequent. I had 9 cards in hand at one point. What's the point? And your opponent getting benefit when you used the enlist action was too hard to keep track of and made zero thematic sense. Could drop this part and it would make little difference. Also seemed a waste to have only max one or two objective cards available when there is a full deck of them. There should have been more access to this, and less to getting extra combat cards. 

Too easy to get around the map with tunnel access everywhere, mines, extra speed. Keeping track of your opponents movement options also a chore as each faction is different. Not much interaction, and battles are a crapshoot as you just get lucky when drawing combat cards. Could easily get a 5 or a 2. No skill involved there. 

Game even worse with 5 players. Still very little interaction. Drags on far too long. Almost everyone was begging the star leader to end the game. 

My advice for future designers: find a good painting, then kickstart a game based on it. You too can raise 1.8 million. The box art is amazing, only wish the game was half as good. 

Update: rating lowered from 5 to a 1. Not impressed with Stegmaier's attitude and customer service. Refused to replace damaged parts of the game, even after sending photos. Understandable, as the 1.8 million was already spent on jumping beans and two pieces of precious cardboard were not available. Perhaps he needs to convert 2 wood to cardboard? Then posted my private emails in the BGG forums so his pack of fanboy wolves could go to town. Never experienced anything like it. So unprofessional, the mind boggles. Needs to assign someone else to customer service and take a vacation. 

Actual Stegmaier quote while posting my private emails to a BGG forum while refusing to replace damaged items: "Obviously my customers are incredibly important to me..."

RATING: 7
Its probably not my favorite genre, but Scythe is a solid design with some nice ideas. I dont know yet how much the starting strategy is scripted (i.e depending on your position, faction and onjective) and it starts a bit slow. TBS: You can do a lot of nice moves and turns are reasonable fast in execution. The boards topology is very thought through and I like it that military is important, but not game-defining. All in all something Id like to explore further, even if Im not head over heels just yet.

I think the feeling is comparable to the other Stonemeyergames, so if you enjoyed Vinoculture and/or Euphoria you probably enjoy this one as well and vice versa. 
This is also true to the theme: While its certainly thematic, I have the nagging feeling the cool theme could have come out just a bit more.

Not sure why people are crazy for this.  I like the asymmetrical player boards (not the factions, but the actual actions).  I like the resource gathering.  I detest the combat, and that you can be penalised for it, the 'weakest' faction not having combat cards, but stealing them before combat is way too good.  My first play I had the 'military faction' and handed out 2 victories only claiming one due to miscalculating when to use my 'power'. An interesting Game of Thrones Lite game with resource gathering.  But why not play Game of Thrones, or a resource gathering game.  I would put this into the gateway game category for people who want something heavier than Catan, but don't want a 'real game' like Game of Thrones.

I have really enjoyed my plays of this so far. The engine building / civ building mixture really clicks for me. The combat is at the perfect level - it is meaningful but not so painful or damaging that it ruins the game for me. Plus, the art and presentation is just fantastic. This is currently my favorite euro / ameritrash hybrid.

Art Collector Edition - Fantastic presentation

This is definitely up there with the best production values ever seen in a game. The card stock is amazing and the custom resource pieces and money are really cool. Not crazy about the mech designs though. Love all the packaging and all of the card artwork is top notch.

Played one solo game to learn the rules and am a little disappointed. The automata cards are a bit fiddly, as is movement. There is very little tension too. I do love the idea of SM's automata cards (pioneered in Viticulture) but just wish they were a little easier to follow (I believe they are supposed to be once you get used to them). Solo play was a big draw, but sometimes the playing of a solo game of this type is occluded by all the housekeeping and rules searching being thrust on one person. I know where are some lovely player aids included, but the be honest, these are more memory aids than anything else. They make the game easier to play but not to pick up.

It seems like there is a big gap between the solitaire aspect of the first rounds and the potential conflict of later rounds -not sure how that is going to resolve itself but will wait to see.

Aesthetically this is, and will always be, the best looking game that I own. I'm still fairly new to this whole world of board games but I'm a huge fan of dominion, and now I am a huge fan of scythe! I have a lot of friends who love it as well which is probably why I enjoy it so much. Without the expansions I'd give this a lower rating, but the expansions really add to the game and are what pushed it to a 10/10 for me (especially the alternate endings that Wind Gambit provides).

Wonderful looking boardgame, astonishing components and artworks. Some nice design ideas as well, but...

First half: It feels like my board plays me, not the other way around.
Second half: I don't like the fight mechanic. It leads to a lot of "Phyrrus victories", the winner of a battle usually gets taken down by the next player immediatly. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
18 plays - Solid game. Interestingly, there's a lot of polar views about this one, but I have enjoyed immensely. I have enjoyed at all player counts. The game play can become a little repetitive due to the fact that the game does push you in certain directions and you'll discover the asymmetry to be a little more of an illusion over multiple plays. I felt the same thing in Euphoria: build a better dystopia, where the different factions actually were not that mechanically different.

The focus on farming and more subtle/ indirect forms of warfare (e.g. space blocking with peasants, which will cause you to lose popularity) make this interesting and different from other area control games. 

While some of the mechanics create thematic breaks (e.g. the classic crossing of a river, only to become stuck on the other side) the game is dripping in theme in other areas. Overall, I take the 'middle road' and think there's a decent balance between incorporating more euro style mechanisms (e.g. build four buildings in a line for VPs) and theme.

Based on one play: Yes the production value is really nice with a nice board design and nice player tokens. The game play on the other hand is less interesting as you upgrade, move or produce items to progress and attempt to reach six of the goals to trigger then end game (and hopefully win). This is more a euro style game than a battle game and overall there are much better games of the genre, don't be overall taken by just the components.

RATING: 6
Scythe is a decent game, but there is entirely too much hype for a game that is basically an engine building resource management  euro.    Sure, there is occasionally combat, but due to the penalty an attacker must take, combat in most instances is discouraged.  Players often can do well by just focusing on their personal "tech" board and expanding on the map just enough to get the resources they need without bothering anyone else.  There is a lot of stuff bolted on to make people think it is some sort of 4X game.  The game ends up taking too long to explain and play for what it is.  I do enjoy it, however, and would play it again.  I would never spend the money to get my own copy because there are better engine building euros for a fraction of the cost.  I would put Scythe in the top 500 perhaps, but it is a joke that it is currently sitting at number 6.  I guess including cool plastic minis translates to several hundred ranking spots.  This is easily the most overrated game on BGG.

Down from an 8 to 6. A bit of a case of me thinking it is a good design but not something I am particularly interested in exploring further.

I was involved in playtesting this game in Phase 1 of testing (7 plays) and now have the final version.  This game impressed me during playtesting because there are so many paths to victory and yet the game seems quite balanced.  This balance seems to have improved even more after our playtest round.  Physically, the game is beautiful (we got the connoisseur's version but all versions are very nice) and, particularly with the expanded board, looks amazing on the table.  And the gameplay matches the visual impression.  I will need to give it a lot more gameplay to give it a final rating, but right now this is a very solid game and I expect to want to get it to the table often.

Scythe has a lot of the trappings of a civilization game--you move your units around a map board in order to use those areas for production.  While the game may not have a tech tree, deploying military units will give players access to special abilities.  There are two that really make it stand apart--the action system and the scoring system.  Players can take any of four pairs of linked actions (except the one they just took); these actions are the same but linked differently for each player.  As the game progresses, players can develop their player board to make each of these actions better, either decreasing costs or increasing rewards.  As for scoring, the game forces players to do a variety of different things, and once they've done that thing as much as the game will allow, they place a scoring star on the corresponding space.  Once a player places all 6 of his stars the game is over, but actual scoring depends not only on stars, but also money, territory controlled, and a multiplier factor.  This is a very interesting game, and while it's not easy to grok the strategy right away, the game flows very nicely even for new players.

Extremely tentative rating. So far it's only been 1 play and it was with 2 players. I enjoyed the game, but I feel like it'll probably shine with 3+. Map felt a bit too large with 2. The move action was a lot more useful then it first appears and getting to do the bottom action was a lot more difficult than the rules let on. I really like that all the player mats are different and each faction has different abilities. Adds a lot to the variability. Not sure I feel like the encounter cards are necessary, but adds a nice touch to the game so far.

Rating may go up a point or settle at around 7. A nice game, but nothing outstanding.

Update: A second play with 4 this time and while I enjoyed it more, I'm still undecided. A lot to like, but I'm not sure how I feel about the combat. It feels like something that needs to be there, but it's also like an after thought. The game seems to benefit less from attacking and more for turtling and getting your resources and stuff upgraded as fast as you can. More plays of this game may adjust my rating, but so far it's a 6 ±1 point of rating.

The worker-placement / upgrade part of the game is awesome. Very strategic and interesting options (+very well made). The ending conditions and the fighting are a bit disconnected though (in my opinion); they are very trivial and fighting is not even close to a well-balanced system like the economics of the game. Besides the gameplay, great production, great value. So overall, good game, but I would rather play something like Terra Mystica.

*UPDATE (2-24-17).  Moving my rating from a 6 to a 7. Had the chance to play this game one more time (5 in total) with a completely different group of people who were all very competitive.  The game mechanics that I previously experienced as rather dull and repetitive, started to feel more like an exciting race to the finish line.  Definitely increased my enjoyment of this game. 

PRO: (+9 stars) 
+ What's not to love about beautiful art, 25 different board combinations right out of the box, and resource management with Mecs? (the stage is set for a win)
+ Fantastic and original story line that draws you in.
+ Variable play styles are welcome as you can play offense or defense. In fact, you can spend the whole game without attacking if you want and still win. 
+ Player boards and all components are top notch quality. Always a welcome and appreciated thing. 
+ Expansion, extended board, and upgraded resources available for purchase.  


CON: (-2 stars) 
- First 20 minutes of game play are interesting, challenging, and rewarding. Once you get a few workers out, get the river walk and +1 movement mech out, and do an upgrade or two, the game begins to feel like task completion instead of fun game play. (Which is a real shame)
- Mostly this is a game of solitaire with very little player interaction, minus the occasional combat or "hey you upgraded, I get a coin" statements.  
- The game board is a hot mess of "everything and the kitchen  sink." Visually, it feels overdone and the color pallet is less than ideal to stare at for 1.5 hours. Dull yellow, pea green, and bright red. (subjective opinion of course)

*IS SCYTHE FOR YOU? 
Well, IF you are a very competitive person, and are more focused on the outcome than the process, then you'll likely love this game and it's gameplay. IF however you play games for the challenge or player interaction more than winning, then you'll likely feel this game, like chewing gum, quickly loses its flavor.

Overall, the fun of this game is dependent on the group you are playing with.

After 20+ plays: I love this game at every player count I've played. (2, 3, 4, 5). 

At 2-player on a pre-determined map, yes, you can avoid each other and more or less freely roam, but I still feel the tension of having to produce stars and hex control as fast as possible, as I watch my opponent's each move and guess their trajectory, wondering how many turns I have left to get it done. 

Then at higher player counts- oof! wow. A different game. Territory is precious, and getting around can quickly get tricky. With experienced players, turns can whip around super fast.

The whole, "it's not so much about combat, as it is about the threat of combat" is so true and so great. Just the threat has totally messed with my plans; it's a mind game! The more I play, the more I appreciate this.

Replayability continues to be amazing, largely thanks to being able to play different combos of player mat and faction, plus the variability in what you're playing against (factions, mats, amount of players)- and so many different paths to victory. Every game, to have a shot at winning, I have to take a fresh look at what my best approach might be. Cherry on top is the achievements that push you to try to win under certain restrictions/conditions; with as much experience as we have now, we've won under some surprising conditions! (Including my wife, winning with less than 6 popularity!!)

Scythe also meets my criteria for having gender parity in the roles, then gets bonus points for having more women than men!

More bonus points for Jamey Stegmaier creating community around his game, and being super involved. You can ask a question in one of his Facebook groups, and have it answered in minutes, often by Jamey himself.

And finally, the quality components and original artwork elevate everything.

Completely pointless game. Build huge war machines with hardly any fighting.  Encounter cards that are basically all the same. Very repetative turns. I quickly lost interest in what the other players were doing, and then lost interest in what I was doing. The game is an exercise in efficiency with too much downtime and very little interaction. Won't play this again. 
Looks pretty.

This is a miniature 4X game, basically reducing exploration to event cards, giving only singular uses to resources, deliberately giving penalties to battling over certain areas, and offering zero player elimination.  The strategy revolves around constructing an engine, managing your Popularity, and making the most of your actions.

Is this a great game?  Not for the price point.  You can pick up March of the Ants for half the price and about the same amount of play time per session, you can pick up Eclipse for a little bit more for longer play times and a more authentic 4X experience.  Buy something else.

Overall, I was quite disappointed with this game. I Kickstarted it and bought into the hype only to find a game that corrals you down an ideal path. The big board and player mats give the illusion of options, but choices are surprisingly narrow. I wanted to like it so much, but after 4 plays gave up hope. It's an okay game, but I own 100s of great games, so it was never going to get played enough.

It borrows from several games that I enjoy (including Kemet, Eclipse, and Terra Mystica), but pales in comparison to all three. The combat feels flat, the resource management is simplistic, and the asymmetric powers are too similar to be really interesting. 

In the end, I turned it into a handsome profit, so I don't regret the purchase, but I definitely learned a lesson about 'style over substance'.

Right off the bat, to state the obvious, the art is unparalleled in this game. Fortunately there is a great game behind it to make this game one of my all time favorites. The engine building in this game is great and I am really interested in the legacy style expansion. When I first played I did notice towards the end game that most players are less concerned with each other and really just have their noses down looking at their own player board. Not necessarily a bad thing, I just expected a little more player interaction. If I could find a variant that made combat just a little more relevant and less of detriment for engaging in it, then this game would easily be number one.

- Lot's of rules, especially when playing for the first time, it almost took me 1 hour to explain (now I've played it myself, it will probably go faster)
- They point it out in the rules, but it is indeed easy to forgot to take the coins when you take the bottom action. As this can decide over winning or not, they should figure out something for that.
+ Game mechanisms interlock very well together
+ Wars are only a minor aspect of this game (something I hoped for as being a Eurogamer :-), but you feel indeed the constant threat of being attacked. reminds me in that way a bit of Eclipse, were the war-aspect is for sure bigger
+ There are different paths to victory: putting away your stars and pushing your popularity is clearly one of them, but don't underestimate the looting of cash during the game!

Scythe undoubtedly deserves the tremendous amount of praise that it's been getting amongst gamers. It is a beautiful, shiny, well-oiled machine that is easy to pick up, but offers an immense amount of depth and replayability. Though it looks like a war game, it is much more of a euro filled with homages to different gaming genres, including war games, area control games, worker placement euro-y goodness, and more. It is, without a doubt, a work of Gaming Art.

One play so far.  Fantastic quality components, board, rules and gameplay.  Took a while to explain all the rules, but the game time was impressive for our gaming group as we typically double the box time.

Can't wait to play again.

First new game of the month (of July) and perhaps the single best game of the year (unless I get my hands on Feast for Odin, of course).  

This game is easy top 20 material. I have played a TON of games in the short few weeks I have owned it and there is still so much to explore! SO MUCH replay value and EVERYONE I play with loves this game. It is a crowd pleaser. So many interesting choices and combinations to consider. You are actively thinking the entire time and planning a head. I simply can't get enough of this game. So much asymmetry and it is wonderfully challenging each time. WANT MORE PLAYS NOW!

RATING: 6
Tentative rating, based on several plays of a near-final prototype.

Gameplay in Scythe consists of two main parts: engine building and combat. Engine building works fine. There are a few elements, such as objectives, that encourage you to try out different approaches. Unfortunately, these are often a bit too weak to lure you away from the otherwise optimal path.

The combat system is where Scythe doesn't work well for my group. Combats are fought out using a blind-bidding mechanism. It seems that the idea is that there are many small combats. However, there are serious rewards to be gained from combat, and in my plays, most players were not going to risk those rewards. As a result, there were mostly large combats, in which the attacker was reasonably sure of the win. So, there were few battles.

The artwork, which was one of the things that attracted me to the game, seems tacked on in some places. The Encounter cards seem as if they would have been better if there was a story explaining the situation instead of an image that has to convey the situation.

I want to like Scythe because it's a great production, but I find it boring and repetitive. The latter complaint seems wrong to me since most games I feel, are repetitive by nature, but Scythe lacks a bit of dynamic tension or tactical situations that break the dullness of doing the same actions over and over again. Combat situations are few and far between and when they do happen, they're largely anticlimactic. As awesome as the artwork and theme is, it doesn't really shine through the gameplay. Sure the actions all make thematic sense (maybe except the enlist action); they just don't amount to anything exciting or interesting for me. I should give it more plays, but at this point, there's just too many other games I rather play.

The kind of game that I played with my group, and even the non "gamers" begged me to bring it to the table the next week again. It's incredibly intuitive once you get going, for as complex as all the systems are.

After 3 plays Scythe is now a 10. Jenn says this is her favorite game and I agree. At first I wasn't sure if this was better than Eclipse; I am still unsure, but I can say now that I like it more. Scythe has become the new house favorite.

Favorite things about the game: So intuitive, deep, and the characters are so charming. The star system makes the game objectives so clear for new players.

Great artwork on cards but gameplaywise I'm a bit disappointed. In the first half of the game you basically play solitaire, optimizing your first 8 or so turns. Then, some interaction occurs but not enough to keep me interested. Will play again, but after two games it's only an ok game for me.

RATING: 5
Well, I got to play the current hotness and, overall, enjoyed the experience. We played with five players (probably too many), including one who went on the warpath early which strongly affected two others. In contrast, I was fortunate to eke out a solitaire game in my own corner of the map. The player boards are initially confusing (even with a good teach) and it is only through putting theory into practice that you really get the gist: the fact that each has their actions in different places caused some confusion around the table.
Learning what I *should* be doing took me most of the game, so further plays could allow for some actual strategising. I had the mech-building board and the dominating faction, but neither suited my play-style, so I ignored their powers for the most part. In the end, I was one of the two 'peaceful' nations (one attack each, all game) and won a very close tie-break. A cut above.

Work of Art; super high production value, artwork, minis, components (especially with collector's edition). Asymmetrical player mats (a.la Terra Mystica, which draws a fair comparison on paper) Engine building, area control. Low luck elements, player decisions have high impact.
-Heavy Euro game, plays longer than advertised. A 4X game that doesn't do all of it all that well; not a fan of the random/bidding combat (nor tactics rewarding piling on the weakest player). Theme is fairly weak apart from the artwork. Despite the individual player powers a criticism suggests a railroaded race of efficiency with replayability concerns. Price/availability concerns?

This is an objectives based efficency game that uses a central board, so that players can attack each other. Actions are quick and simple, with each player placing their pawn on one of 4 action spots, and then resolving one or both of the actions that match that spot. The rule is you must take a different action each turn, which is where a big part of the puzzle comes in.

Every player gets a faction board and an asymmetrical action board at the start of the game. The synergy between these two boards, will determine your capacity for success in the game to a large degree, which is troublesome.

There are a few euro/ameritrash hybrid games, and I want to say the thing that makes this game special (aside from the beautiful components) is that when you produce resources, they sit on the hex until you use them, which means in theory someone could invade you and take them.

I do need to mention that where someone can move to is very hard to keep track of. Each player has a series of unique abilities they can unlock, not to mention that each player has different rules for how they can walk across rivers, not to mention the middle area of the board has a lot of teleportation spots, not to mention that players can build their own personal teleportation spot anywhere, not to mention one faction gets to use a type of terrain as if they had built their personal teleport.

This game took a few plays to grow on me. Once I had really internalized the factions and the mechanisms and the scoring process, I started to see the depth this game provides.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional

Dieses Spiel hat Schwächen. Oft hat man das Gefühl, dass die Auswahl des Spielertableaus die Taktik vorgibt und man in vielen Momenten nur den vom Spiel vorgegebenen Roten Faden weiter spielt und kaum Auswahl hat. Außerdem ist mir persönlich der sechste Stern zu viel- das Ende des Spiels könnte deutlich glatter und eleganter sein (die Erweiterung, die dieses Problem behandelt kommt noch dieses Jahr).
Allerdings hat dieses Spiel auch Stärken, die deutlich überwiegen: die Völker haben unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten und Stärken, die meiner Meinung nach vollkommen ausgeglichen sind! Ich habe noch kein Spiel erlebt, in dem ein Spieler auf Grund seines übermächtigen Volkes gewonnen hat. Da dieses Spiel nur minimal vom Zufall lebt, hängt wirklich viel von der Taktik und der Erfahrung der Spieler ab und man erkennt eine stetige Lernkurve. Der Wettlauf um die Siegpunkte ist eine tolle Idee, da jeder Spieler unterschiedliche Wege geht und selbst beim Erreichen des sechsten Sterns den Sieg noch nicht in der Tasche hat. Mindestens genauso gut gefällt mir das Rennen zur Fabrik und die Verteidigung dieser. Spielerisch also wirklich ein tolles Ding. Was dieses Spiel aber wirklich einzigartig macht, ist der ganze "Firlefanz" drumherum: die Miniaturen sehen fantastisch aus- jeder Charakter hat seine eigene Hintergrundgeschichte (dadurch entsteht fast Rollenspiel-Atmosphäre). Das Artwork ist genauso grandios designed, wie das Spielbrett, dass viele kleinen Details zeigt, die man erst auf den zweiten Blick entdeckt. Teilweise beinhält das Spiel sogar Kleinigkeiten, von denen man vorher gar nicht weiß, dass man sie braucht (unterschiedliche Arbeiter-Formen, eingestanzte Tableaus), die das Spiel aber ausmachen. Mein absolutes Highlight: die Begegnunskarten, die in unseren Spielrunden schon oft für Lacher gesorgt haben.
Dieses Spiel ist mein absolutes Lieblingsspiel und ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass ich in naher Zukunft meine Begeisterung dafür verliere.

A nice and gorgeous game (I have the kickstarter version with the 'natural' resources).
I still haven't tried the Automata solo versions. So far I have been soloing two, three and five player games. 
It's a nice resource conversion game with some elements of area control. It plays quite smoothly and there is a good deal of variation due to the different player boards and faction boards, encounter cards, factory cards, etc.
I don't think it necessarily lives up to the hype (since it got quite a significant level of hype), but it is a well crafted game and I am very happy to own it.
The extended board is much to large for me to try to use it, though at times certain hexes can get overcrowded with resources etc. The normal board barely fits to my playing table.

So far not overly enthused with the automata - it has a very in your face play-style. Will give it a few more chances, but so far I prefer to solo three-player games.

Wouldn't have gone near it if it wasn't for Gamenight! and my friend owning the game. Seems as heavy as Terra Mystica, I didn't even check out the game on BGG so I didn't know that Scythe was more of a medium-weight game as compared to TM. Awesome game with different things to do, you can deploy mechs, hire workers, produce resources, combat with others, pay to increase popularity, combat power/cards and resources, you also have to check what your neighbours are doing more than those further away due to "enlist" benefits and encounter tokens. The encounter card provided a side entertainment for me. Most probably won't win but still willing to try again if given the chance.

Scythe is by far the best new game that I've played over the past year. The rules are rather long and the way the game is played is pretty different from most other strategy games. Once you get a hang of the rules and the flow of the game it becomes much easier and actually allows for quicker play. (Part of the way the game is played allows two players to do different parts of their moves simultaneously). 

Scythe also allows for more variety than most games offer. There are multiple different combinations of factions and different play board combinations. There are also multiple different objective cards, building conditions and random events that can happen each game. There are many different ways to win and to be successful. I'm discovering new ways to play every game. 

Overall, while complex and long (both aspects I actually enjoy), Scythe is definitely worth the time and has near endless replay value.

This game is very strategic!

Not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. But this game is a Euro/dudes-on-a-map hybrid. The asymmetric factions and abilities are nice. The game plays very smoothly and turns are quick. The rules explanation takes a long time, but it just boils down to maximizing your efficiency while taking the core 4 actions. I'm just not a big fan of dudes-on-a-map/miniatures games.

The game is certainly well done. The resources, figures look awesome. A lot of nice flavor as you go the game as well. It seems to be a civilization style game, that is spread across the board so you can develop production. Territory is one of your objectives, nice element that you want to consolidate for production, but then spread out for final scoring.
Each turn you swap among 4 possible actions optionally can add one more, each location has 2 possible action you can perform. It is nice touch forcing you to go to another action. 
Clearing the player board reminds me somewhat of Hansa Tuetonica, where you can unlock additional abilities. However, completing an area seems to have more of an impact since is contributes to your game end and endgame scoring.
If you get locked out of other things you can go for resources or money since that is scoring option as well.
The popularity track is the multiplier for the end game scoring. If you neglect it it will be costly.
While mostly resource acquisition development game there is combat, to grab key locations and as part of one of your scoring, but the game is not dominated by warfare.

I like how each player has a slightly differing abilities, part of the game is learning how to use your faction effectively. All in all on I would enjoy playing again - now that I have better feel for it.

Beautiful, fast, and relatively low overhead (rule-wise) for the weight of the game.

2.5x game (Expand, Exploit, and 0.5*Exterminate)

Race game (to the finish line - ends suddenly; snowballs)

[ESP] Se describe como 4X, una vez jugándolo se puede ver que no es así, sobre todo por la parte de eXterminar.

De la parte de ser un 4X realmente las que más destacan son las de eXpandirse y eXplotar ya que el control de territorios da puntos al final de la partida, así como la producción de recursos depende de los territorios en que tengamos trabajadores.  Hay un poco de eXploración en la parte de los encuentros y no más. En lo que respecta a la eXterminación realmente es mas una guerra fría en la que eventualmente habrá combates pero en general el mismo juego no te incitará a hacerlo a menudo.
 
Una parte muy importante y en la que para mi reside el juego es realmente la combinación de tableros que le toca a cada jugador y el ir seleccionando de la forma más eficiente las acciones que se van ejecutando. 

Para mí es un muy buen Euro con el tema muy bien integrado, con selección de acciones,colocación de trabajadores y administración de recursos en el que hay que controlar territorios para obtener puntos de victoria al final, todo esto mientras todos están en una carrera por poner la sexta estrella. Para mi con todo el hype que tenía cumplió con las expectativas.

RATING: 8.5
Scythe is an excellent game as long as you have the right expectations going in. Players who have never heard of it will almost ALWAYS enjoy the game immensely. I think that says a lot. 

- It's not a heavy or mid-heavy game. Don't expect that. Don't expect that level of strategy either. It looks MUCH more complicated than it is. It shouldn't have a 3.3 weight rating. I'd say 2.8-3.0 is about right. 
- Don't expect full on combat all the time. My problem when I played it is that I expected so little combat based on the reviews that I didn't invest in defending myself at all. I got rolled over. So combat definitely plays a real part, but its not primarily a combat game. 
- DO expect the game to end quickly. The game length is actually pretty short/quick. The game could end abruptly if you don't know how quickly people can earn stars are the end of the game. 

The biggest thing about Scythe is that people are comparing it to heavier strategy games and expecting that level of strategy and replayability or comparing it to other area control games and expecting that level of combat and interaction. It's neither of those things. 

Seriously the closest game I'd compare it to in terms of feel is Settlers of Catan. Obviously its nothing like Catan in terms of mechanics, but in terms of the "feel" it is similar. It is more complex than Catan, but not the level of heavy euros. The level of combat and interaction is similar to Catan without the trading. The economic/resource element is similar.

UPDATE 10/9/17: After playing it 3 times in a row yesterday and wanting to play Food Chain Magnate instead, this game has dropped a little bit for me. Had to downgrade it to an 8. There aren't any big moments in the game. I have to admit that it is a bit "plodding" like SUSD said it was. Kinda sad. Downgraded it to an 8. Still enjoyed my plays and friends still like the game. I still think it has a LOT of depth. I still haven't gotten even close to figuring the game out after 12 plays. But getting better in the game doesn't come through big realizations. It comes from playing slightly better or making a slightly better move. There aren't new concepts to learn, its just that you need to think further ahead and plan a bit better with the concepts that you already have. That's still worth something. And the fact that the game still plays really well with a lot of different types of gamers and can be finished in 1.5 hours for a 4 player game is pretty good.

UPDATE 10/19/17: After playing this a few more times. Getting beaten barely by a friend 52 to 40 in a 3 player game where he rushed 6 stars and playing Albion and Togawa a few times, the game has started to tick back up for me. There were BIG moments in these games whereas in my last updated I said that there wasn't big moments and that it was "plodding". The fact that some of my friends have finally started catching up to me in skill has made the game more tense and therefore a lot more fun for me. There ARE moments where I'm thinking further ahead than my opponent (or attempting to), reading my opponent etc. There have been concepts that I've been learning, such as popularity and territory control for the expansion factions when you cannot close the game out with the normal 2 stars from combat. I argued in my previous update that there weren't new concepts to learn, I guess I was wrong. Interesting how a game can shift. Upgraded the rating from 8 to 8.5.

Though this was a very smartly designed game. Lots going on, but easy enough to handle once you get into it. I really thought to upgrade system was smart, and the tension of combat is great, even though you rarely actually want to get into one. 

However, I'm not a huge fan of direct conflict in my games which makes Scythe not as interesting to me. I also have concerns about the balance of the factions with certain mat combinations. I enjoy this game but ultimately with so many other great options, I rarely find myself thinking I really want to play Scythe over other options available.

- update: what an awesome game,  initially I thought this game would be overwhelming with all the pieces, tokens,  etc.  Read the the rule book and it was easy to read and follow with great illustrations.  Game play was also easy to understand and was already playing games my first game with my 8yr old son who also loved it. The mechanics make sense its streamlined and was a good introductory to a euro style game.  Can't wait to try this out with more players.

Due: Aug 2016
Oct 2015: Oh how it is terrible to love games. SM's kickstarter opened with a bang - and lots of people who didn't read the 'new SG game rules'. SM was going to do a different stretch-goal process so I didn't join the $500k day-one backers. I wanted to 'earn' a goal... public outcry changed the process 'back to the normal' SG-process. I'll probably try to be the $1M backer... possibly on day 9-10.

November 2015:  I got to play the demo copy JR Honeycutt had in Dallas.  I'm not a 4X gamer and I was struggling to understand 'the engine'. I was very inefficient and paid for it. Others were done with our play but I immediately wanted another play to re-engage with another route...

July 2016: I got mine but I've only played other's. Barely in and loving it. It might slide later but I always want to play now.

I don't like Euros much at all. I gave this one a chance, and there were definitely moments of fun, but it's the same old point salad race to the finish line with no soul. The art is gorgeous, and everything else is pretty mediocre. I understand why people like it, but I think there are so many better games out there to play. In the end, all the players do the same things in a different order, and the one who did it better...wins! There is no story arc, no intrigue, no moments of triumph. I moved cubes from the top row to the bottom row better than you did. Or maybe I didn't. Honestly, the only reason I gave this a '6' instead of '5' was because I ended up playing a seven player game, and I love that large group feel of being in something together. Sadly, the thing we were in together was a Euro. : (

Pros:
1. Efficiency. First and foremost, this is a game about efficiency. You plan multiple turns ahead being sure you can maximize each and every turn.
2. Variability. There are 5 different factions with a different ability and 5 different player boards each with a different set up. Every combo will play completely different.
3. Epic. This is an epic euro game. The theme is well integrated (especially for a euro). It's a huge sprawling board with amazing artwork on the cards and the board.
4. Multiple routes to victory. A player can focus on territories, battling, production. Everything you do is improving your board.
5. Solo. The solo play in this game is amazing. It's a little difficult to learn, but once learned it is excellent.

Cons:
1. Long teach. This game will take upwards of 15 minutes to teach. There will still be many many question while playing.

Summary: This is an incredible game. The artwork is great, the minis are great, the game play is great. After every play, you will be looking back to try and figure out where you went wrong, where was your efficiency reduced. You'll want to play again and often and experiment with all of the different combos you can play with.

Unfortunately in my case the hype turned into disappointment. I was lured to the game by reviews and opinions saying that it's almost like a "Terra Mystica" with conflict. Well, it's not. It's a rather simple eurogame bloated with unnecessary chrome and components. The development part of the game is simple, really - turn four types of resources into four types of benefits (to build mechs, buildings, to develop "technology" and gain other advantages). No excitement here, no intricate strategies, just plain simple pay X to get a minor thing. Do some minor things for several rounds and hopefully someone will win. 

And then there's the conflict. Boring, too. Predictable and stale. Again, zero excitement even WHEN it happens, and it doesn't happen a whole lot (someone who doesn't fight even once may easily steal the win).

I don't know, it's just too... plain. Nothing new or interesting here, a game that's very, and I mean VERY basic at its core. It may be fun for people who don't enjoy heavy eurogames and want something more accessible that looks epic (because it's a good looking game, you can't argue that). If you expect meaty gameplay - avoid.

This game is phenomenal.  The art and theme are out of this world and make it a joy to play. The gameplay itself was was very well thought out, fantastic attention to detail. It's a lot of managing and building your engine, with a military aspect that is secondary and is more of an insurance policy. Learning this game took one play through, but the best part is that teaching it is a breeze and new comers will get it quick. This is a must for any collection.

It may not be perfect, but it gets a 10 in my book.

I definitely recommend it to all gamers who can handle a game of medium to medium high complexity.

A time for extracting oil, reaping harvests, digging for steel, and amassing massive amounts of lumber; all the while repelling rivaling nations as you explore the mysterious factory. What a time to be a tyrant. Heavy euro area-control game. The best thing about this game is you can play it symmetric and asymmetric. If you'd rather sit back and play resource management and engine building, you certainly can. If you want to play more in your face against your opponents, you are allowed to do that. Its build-up to its release is very well-deserved.

Scythe is a monumental game that plays fast. The artwork ist outstanding as is the quality of the game in general. I am happy to be an owner of it. My goal is to upgrade the material to have the maximum scythe because this game deserves it. 
Every game feels different due to great variety. If you do not want to fight, you don't have to. I like that. 
Why not 10? Hmm I play a lot solo games. Unfortunately the Automa solo Scythe variant did not impress be at all. It plays cold without any atmosphere and even matematically. That's not how I want to feel games. :-)

One of our favourite games of 2016. After getting it out of the box and setting up for our first game looked very daunting but turned out to be quite straightforward with challenging and interesting decisions to make. Goes without saying is beautifully produced with high quality pieces and board - we very much like getting it to the table for this reason. But undeerneath that chrome is also an elegantly designed game.

For a game with such massive mechs stomping around, this is a surprisingly peaceful euro. Of course, there is room to blow stuff up if that is your goal, but I like that I have a shot at winning even if I'm just doing my own thing in my cozy corner of the map. Occasionally, it's fun to rush the center and grab some powerful upgrades or sneak into another players quadrant to snatch some tokens, but the I have the most fun just managing my resources and optimizing my action board. Can't wait to see what an expansion adds.

I admire the relatively quick turns and the intricacies of slowly building up your empire to something grand. I also like that there is far more than one way to accomplish your six goals to trigger the end-point.

Yet, there's something that's not drawing me back to give it one more go. I don't know what it is yet and maybe after more plays I'll re-evaluate, but for now it's a game I like rather than love.

Looks like a complicated, combat-heavy game, but it really is mostly euro. Area control, resource management, and engine building are the main mechanisms. That being said, I'm a big fan.

Great Game.

You control one of 5 factions.   You try to build the best society by achieving different objectives (building, combat, other things).

Each turn you select one of 5 spaces on your board (the 5th is only available after you've traveled to the center of the board).  Each space has 2 possible actions you can take.  Won't be able to take them all, as you won't have the resources to do it.

So you control territory, manage production, build mechs, have encounters, manage you military power, manage your popularity, etc....

I've painted the miniatures.

Amazing production! This game just pops. Awesome mini's, a massive detailed board and player boards carved to fit each component.

Extensive set of rules to remember but all are fairly simple. The complexity seems to come from how one action impacts other secondary actions for you or even your opponent.

The multiple paths to victory seem well balanced. Enjoyed the first play and need to try out some different strategies.

I have to be honest, I was REALLY excited for Scythe. It seemed like such a perfect game. I like the idea of having mechs whose sole purpose isn't fighting. I figured I was in for a game that had more of a cold-war feel to it. And it kind of does, but it's not that dynamic. It' kind of a slow-moving game that's absolutely beautiful. It's easy enough to learn and play, but it can be a little bit of a slog. I have to play more to really get a good picture of it.

When I first played this game it was different that what I expected.  For weeks after I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I ended up getting this as a gift and it quickly rose to my favorite game.

I've only played it with one person who didn't like it immediately - but everyone always comes around.  The mechanics are so smooth.  The way you gain efficiency over time makes this game ease into a strategic delight as you approach end-game.

Great game to bring out when an engine-building game is desired! Plenty of replayability and at least there are mechs to play with no matter how well the game is going. The table presence brings a lot of attention, if requiring a lot of setup for the amount of play time.

The game is fine, but neither the gameplay nor the illustration much excite me. Yeah, it has good art, but the map looks very meh and the almost depressing art style does not really motivate me to play. To a large degree the game is optimizing your moves independent from other players (the first third of the game you literally play on your own). I do not like that you fulfill all the different tasks like building all buildings or putting out all workers just for the sake of completing the task. To me the game lacks focus what you actually want to achieve.

Scythe is a funky mix of different things.  At the outset, it seems like you'll be fighting...but then you end up gathering and managing resources and avoiding conflict.  The components are top notch and we love busting this one out.

No desire to play this anymore. There are better resource management/production/building games out there (take Terra Mystica or Concordia for example, and as area control/combat game Scythe is just subpar experience. Mechanically sound but a bit repeative and soulless exercise, and theme really could be anything. A smash of different mechanics into one game. 

Going to zero popularity early on is the way to go since then you can just attack without any penalty, especially with some of the more aggressive factions. You can potentially destroy somebody game if they are not careful. It can be extra brutal with low player count.

A 4X with a euro heart. All roads to victory demand a well thought-out strategy, especially the combat. I can't think of another game that demands such careful analysis of combat engagement. 

The theme and mechanics are both amazing and are woven together seamlessly.

Beautiful game that tries to combine a lot of mechanics but excels at none on them. 
It's a game of baby stept, but I never have the feeling that I'm making a big move. The end of the game can be very abrupt, which is sometimes fun and sometimes less fun. Overall it's a decent game that and it's fine to play it once in a while.

Move workers around, gather resources, turn them into victory points, occassionally stomp on somethign with one of your mechs. There is a lot going on in this game, a lot of mechanics I've seen elsewhere and it is hard to assess it on a single play (I won by an enormous landslide). There are certainly a lot of very pretty pieces but it may be more chrome than substance.

My Kickstarter copy finally arrived this week - and last night I managed to get a 2p game in against my wife. I didn't expect it to be especially great with 2p, it was mainly just a learning game. Predictably, she wiped the floor with me (she always does in most games, especially new ones - she won this 95 to 58, although I'm sure I forgot to take coins from my bottom row actions quite a few times). But I liked the game and could see plenty of potential. Most classic Euros lack a meaningful map on which players can interact in a direct way - one of the many reasons why Terra Mystica is my favourite game is that, along with everything else, it has a map on which players struggle and compete, and which determines most of the end-game bonuses. Although very different from TM in most other respects, Scythe has this to.

I also love the variability of the game, especially the 25 different faction/player mat combinations. Not to mention all the different Encounter cards, Factory cards and Objective cards. I hope this one goes down well with my main gaming groups (I expect that it will), because it's a game I'd really love to explore some more. I'm rating it 8 for now, but I can easily see this going up.

About the only small criticism I can think of is that downtime could become an issue in 4 or 5-player games. Unless someone attacks you you aren't involved in other players' turns - yes you can get recruit bonuses but this, while important to the game, doesn't involve you in any decisions.

This game is great. I don't really care about hype. I enjoy the puzzle and tough decisions. I love getting my engine working and trying to make efficient moves. It's crazy how much painting the main characters adds to the experience. I'll probably paint up the mechs as well. They shouldn't be as much work. There are countless setup configuration variations which makes replayability at a high.

RATING: 8
No Sçythe, somos povos de um leste europeu fictício que querem desenvolver seus países, desenvolvimento esse medido através de pontos de vitória. Conseguimos esses pontos de vitória dominando territórios, alcançando objetivos e gerando recursos.

Apesar de ter uma temática que lembra jogos de batalha, este é um jogo bem euro, no qual a porrada é controlada e pouco debilitante. Me lembrou demais o Terra Mystica, no qual segundo li ele foi assumidamente inspirado, por isso vou fazer a review comparando com ele:

- Povos / raças com habilidades especiais: assim como no TM, no Sçythe você ganha um povo que tem habilidades específicas, que orienta sua forma de jogar. Mas o Sçythe expande em cima disso, pois seu tabuleiro pessoal consiste na junção do tabuleiro da sua raça, com suas habilidades especiais + um tabuleiro de ações, que pode vir com diversas combinações.

- Mapa não-modular: Assim como no TM, o mapa é fixo, mas ao contrário dele, cada raça sai sempre da mesma base, o que deixa o início do jogo um pouco mais previsível.

- Formas de pontuação e condições de jogo modulares: Assim como no TM, no início e ao longo do jogo sorteiam-se diversos bônus, que dão incentivos do que você deve fazer no seu jogo.

- Tabuleiro pessoal à la TM / Eclipse: mesma mecânica de tudo que você tira do seu tabuleiro pra botar em jogo (ou em outro lugar do tabuleiro) passa a te dar algo que aquilo que você tirou escondia quando estava no seu tabuleiro.

- Turnos rápidos: assim como no TM, vc faz uma ação e acabou. Com a vantagem de que você tem ainda menos opções do que fazer: são 4 ações (5 se vc fizer uma fábrica), que começam ruins mas conforme você vai se desenvolvendo, vão ficando cada vez melhores.

- Sensação gostosa de desenvolvimento: que acontece no TM tb: quanto mais pra frente você está no jogo, melhor vai ficando sua nação e melhores são as 4 ações que vc tem disponíveis.

- Jogo lindo: nisso ele dá de dez no TM (que já é bonito) e em praticamente qualquer outro jogo: Sçythe é lindo, tabuleirão central gigante, ilustrações fodas, recursos são um absurdo - parece miniatura de maquete, e as pecinhas de madeira são estilo Viticulture.

- Mecanicamente, o que vi de mais inovador no jogo foi a ideia de que ao produzir um recurso, ele fica no tabuleiro central, no tile onde foi produzido, e só é seu se tiver alguém seu no terreno - e se outra pessoa ocupar - ou te tirar - do terreno, ela que vai poder usá-lo.

- Fora isso, ele na verdade é um apanhadão de mecânicas gostosas de outros jogos, particularmente do TM, manicuradas ao extremo pra funcionar muito bem. É super intuitivo, tudo funciona lindamente, mas sinto falta de alguma coisa mais diferente pra ser realmente top de linha.

- Uma coisa que poderia compensar a falta de inovação seria mais interatividade entre os jogadores. No nosso jogo, só aconteceram combates no final, e todos eles com o único objetivo de cumprir objetivo e ganhar ponto. Senti falta de eles serem mais decisivos para o jogo em si, de a ocupação de espaço ser mais apertada e forçar as pessoas a se esbarrarem. O fato dos combates não serem debilitantes é ótimo, perder não é um problema, mas eles poderiam ser mais importantes para o jogo. Fora ele, existe interação nos enlists, que permitem que vc ganhe coisas com as ações dos outros, mas em geral e só um "ops! vc fez tal coisa, ganhei tal coisa", e não algo que vc leva em conta para o seu planejamento. Tem interação também na disputa de quem chega primeiro nas cartas de encontro, mas é só uma corridinha bem suave. De forma geral, é meio multiplayer solitaire sim. A interação e o aperto estão bem mais presentes no TM, que pra mim é um jogo melhor.

- Numa nova partida, eu tentaria focar menos em objetivos e mais em ganhar ponto ocupando território pra ver se com isso o jogo fica mais interativo. Mas se não ajudar tanto, eu diria que é um jogo nota 8: muito bom, sólido, mas passado o hype não vai ser referência como é o TM - que pra mim é 10.

(+) Beautiful components

(+) An admirably short game time for the epic scope and many mechanisms involved in this game

(+) Combination of fun mechanics: area control, engine building, resource management, ...

(+) Set up is pretty random

(-) The game itself is not very innovative

(-) The random set-up combined with the different player powers can result in unbalanced gameplay situations

(-) I think the short game time for such a title is a major advantage, and probably the only reason why I would consider adding this game to my collection, but on the other hand I'm not sure whether I want my games with an epic scope to play so 'quickly'.

(-) The combination of the different mechanics is fun, but because the game combines so many of them in the short game time, none of these mechanics has gotten implemented 'to the fullest'. The engine building is great fun, but only offers very limited choices, the area control is nice - but implemented on a very basic scale, ...

Game length: about 2 hours for a 4-player game.

RATING: 6
A game that is a Jack of all trades, but a master of none.

As a solitaire, turn based engine building game, it is actually quite nice. Once you figure out the strategy of your faction and player board, the choices of how to progress become a bit formulaic, but the journey of finding how to optimize your moves is fairly enjoyable. It is faster and more satisfying in other engine building games, but is certainly not bad in Scythe.

In my opinion, there are three knocks against Scythe which takes it from an 8 or 9 to a 6.

1. Some factions and player boards are flat out better or more fun to play as than others. Some player boards don't mesh well with certain factions at all, making the game less enjoyable than it could be. It doesn't create an interesting and compelling challenge, it just makes you wish you had another player board to make building your engine more efficient and fun.

2. The combat in this game is neither compelling or satisfying. With so much of the game evolving around creating the most efficient economy, the combat feels rather out of place. Combat is almost never a satisfying, hard fought victory with stakes, rather a mild inconvenience for the person being attacked, which brings no joy to either party. The fact that one faction is so heavily incentivized to attack just feels out of place, and can turn the game into an unenjoyable slog.

3. Playing with players new to the game, or people prone to Analysis Paralysis, can grind the game to a halt worse than most other games. You can have your next 4 moves to build a mech or a structure, and then have to wait a tedious 20+ minutes for play to go around the table four times, which takes away your satisfaction of the process of achieving your goal.

To sum it all up, Scythe is a game with lots of variety, and touches upon many, many genres and tropes of board games, which is quite an accomplishment. However, for everything that Scythe does, there is another game out there that does it quite a bit better, and just leaves me wanting more from Scythe.

The game itself is more euro-y than I prefer, and while it's marketed as a 4x game, it feels like you're playing one of those in a straitjacket. 

Some will find the management of the player board an interesting challenge, I find it annoying and limiting.

I will play this again, but I won't bring it to the table myself.

Scythe is a pretty straight forward game that initially looks very confusing. I enjoy the tactical aspects of it - you only have four different actions to choose between but they can result in so many different things. You'll have to relate those tactics to a strategic masterplan if you want to have any chance at winning, but the game has a strong tactical element of adjusting on the fly and making the best of the current board situation.

It's also a beautiful game. Purdyness definitely elevates a gaming experience for me.

The included automa system is pretty darn good too. (That danish guy is no joke!) I generally play this with two human players, and I've had as many as three automas thrown in the mix at the same time. Big thanks for including reference cards for all the automa actions.

The rule book does a great job too! Scythe and aviticulture have among the best rule books I've read.


I wish I was better at painting minis, because I would like to paint the mechs and characters. My SO is a natural at painting, but she's working through our massive Arcadia Quest collection. (I think she's finished 4-5 pets so far, so it'll be a while...)

I have a very hard time understanding the criticism aimed at Scythe. Really, I don't get it.

Only one play.

Jamey clearly understands just how important pacing is in game design.  I'm also impressed with how the combat feels so intense, yet the players are not losing units.  Direct conflict in a multiplayer (3 or greater) game is a holy grail for many game designers.   It has probably near to the maximum level of direct conflict you are able to put in a game where players are building infrastructure, where the players do not feel bullied or extremely frustrated.  

Kemet might be overall a game that I prefer in this realm, but the losing players will not have a great experience.  Last game of Kemet I played someone at the table said "I f#@ing hate this game" after losing his second battle and the game.  This is likely not something you will hear in a game of Scythe.

There are some UI quirks like the spaces where your purchasable mechs are contain text.  I found myself (and everyone else at the table) placing their mech minis above or around each of these spaces.  I also think the player boards could have been done with no text at all, instead having more clear iconography on how they work, as having both text and icons in each area actually makes things more complex to understand for new players.

I would really like to play this again, and kinda regret not backing it on KS.

Jamey Stegmaier is the real deal and sets the bar for modern game publication.  He's talented with customer service, logistics, marketing, and community building.  But most importantly, he's a very good game designer.

This game is in a word - fascinating. Everything about it fascinates me - the art, the mechanisms, the components. Even the retail version of the game boasts excellent components.

If you think about it, this games doesn't really offer anything innovative or new. Take one of its mechanisms and you can probably find a game that did it before (though I have yet to find an equivalent of the upgrading mechanism it uses). However, the way it seamlessly integrates these mechanisms in such a way that its theme shines through it is simply awesome.

This game encourages planning ahead and its nature differs for every player count and their behavior. While the threat of combat is emphasized rather than combat itself, combat can still be done by the more aggressive players, though they have to plan it accordingly and not just mindlessly throw their units around. I won't classify it as a war game though.

All in all, I enjoyed every aspect of the game and can't wait to play more of it. There's just something satisfying about going from one action a turn to suddenly doing a lot more as you make every action more efficient.

A GREAT game, one of the crowning jewels of my collection. Scythe is so, so easy on the eyes (this artist has really set himself and this game far ahead of the competition), and remarkably easy to teach. A couple flaws weigh this game down for me, though:

1. The faction abilities, while unique and intriguing, don't scale as well as the game does. I've found that Saxony becomes much more powerful at higher player counts, while Polania and Nordic (the latter already being clearly weaker than its counterparts) become more powerful at lower player counts. I like that the different player mats can alleviate this, but sometimes it backfires and propels an already dominant faction miles above the rest (e.g. Rusviet + Industrial). This could be dealt with by giving newer players more powerful factions, sometimes to no avail, however.

2. The game-ending star placement is frustrating, mostly for new players. I understand that the Wind Gambit expansion deals with this, and house rules are always an option, but I think Scythe's base should be equipped with a "one more turn for each player" mechanic, or something akin to the pretender token in Inis.

3. Two factions on the board not included in base game. Every time I introduce Scythe to someone new, I get asked "where are the other factions?" I have to tell them that they're not included, and that they're in one of the expansions. Trust me, NO ONE wants to play 7-player Scythe, but it does feel cheap and unwarranted to withhold essential bits of the game from the customers of the base game.

Despite these points, this is a fantastic game that I will be bringing to the table many times in the future. The subtle mechanics really make this a game that people want to eventually MASTER, rather than just improve!

RATING: 7
The game is good fun and challenging but I feel like the designer added extra features trying to make the game more complex and deep but it didn't work.  Despite the multitude of components and rules, it is not a very deep game and doesn't have a lot of tough decisions to be made.  Your path to victory is pretty simple and if you can execute it, you will win or at least do very well.  Felt like an inferior and simpler version of Terra Mystica.  Overhyped.

Almost 'sandbox' feel, so many options and ways to play as well as to win the game. Scythe world and theme defined by art of Jacub Rozalsky is present. This is not area control game nor war game per se, environment interacts with players, players influence other players just by their presence and threat of confrontation. Combat resolution is very clever and fits the style of the game.

Automa is great bonus. Top production and components another bonus (Collectors Edition). And another...attention to detail (accross all parts and features) is spectacular and really enhances the experience.

Great solo, with human opponents even better.

One (dual) action system mitigates downtime and makes this game enjoyable even with 4/5 players. 2 to 3 hours playtime is more than acceptable considering the deepness of the game and many possible long term strategies to follow.

Great game !

i followed a favorite artist and bumped into Scythe on kickstarter. this game is often described as "over hyped," but, since i found it mostly by accident and it exceeded my every expectation, i'm rather of the opinion that it's not "over" at all. granted, it might not be the game you think. this is a pretty straight forward area control worker placement game with the shadow of military hanging over the board like smoke. every path you could take leads to stars, although i wouldn't call it a points salad. exploration, upgrades, popularity, and clever combat lead to many possible strategies. violence often takes the form of a cold war arms race with no one wanting to risk feeding another player one of the six stars they need to end the game. other times you'll see the day defined by repeated low-power skirmishes back and forth, defeat only ever a minor setback. it plays well 3-5 players, can handle 2-7 players, and the solo Automa deck makes for a challenge that is more than simply solving a puzzle. i consider this game money well spent and i'll own all three expansions.

I truly can't play this game enough, and fortunately it makes it to the table very often. More people playing the better interaction and full game play can be experienced. Many random elements at the beginning of the game make each play a new experience. Well worth investing in the game and will be in collection for a very long time.

Euro about developing your action-selection engine.  Each player is basically trying to reach the same goal of optimizing their engine, by activating all your workers and mechs, improving your actions and reducing their costs (upgrade and enlist), and building buildings.  There is some customization in selecting a factory card mid-game which gives you an additional improved action only you have access to, but most of the variation in strategy is front-loaded in the combination of 2 starting boards you get, as each faction has a different ability and each board has quite a bit of variation in the costs of actions.  There is some player interaction in fighting for territory on the board and racing for exploration bonuses, but this game seems to me a lot more on the multiplayer solitaire end of the spectrum than the dudes on a map would imply.  Turns go by very fast, but there's a lot of planning several turns ahead to figure out the most effective ways to fully capitalize on each action (e.g. get an extra resource now with trade, so then when I produce next, I'll have just enough to pay for the bonus upgrade action when I boost, which will let me reduce the cost to enlist, etc.).  It's an interesting puzzle and the different factions and boards provide a lot of variability to explore, but for me the lack of interaction means I would see myself tiring of it pretty quickly.  

Production quality is amazing - I really like the double-layer boards with insets for pieces.  Minis are fine - I don't really care.  The art is great but the theme doesn't pull me in at all.  The focus is so much on cleanness of the mechanisms that there's really almost no flavor forcing you to immerse yourself into the theme.

Played a 3 player game and had an absolute blast. I would think it will only get better with more play throughs. Certainly not for everyone, but definitely those who enjoy deeper strategy titles. My only worry is that the game is not nearly as fun playing through alone or with 2. The more the merrier here as I'd love to get at least the full 5 in on this some time. I really recommend this game, went ahead and even had my miniatures painted to enhance the experience.

Great theme and solid mechanics. Not incredibly competitive (it's pretty euro), but is dynamic enough that's it's not just point salad. 7.5/10 as a game, 8.5/10 with theme and art.

Scythe is an incredibly popular game set in a steampunk world of competing factions.  Players each take actions on their own player board that are different  than the  other players each taking actions that help the players build their empire by  gathering resources and using giant machines called Mech's to drive away other players.  This Game is a heavy Euro and the main focus is resource management and battling is an extremely  small part in this game. 

Pros: Variable Player Powers, Extremely Engaging worker placement mechanism, gorgeous components, Beautiful artwork, Fun resource management gameplay, Creative player interactions between turns. Multiple paths to victory,  Simple  Rule set yet deep  decision making 

Cons: Decision options can be overwhelming, Difficult to teach.

RATING: 7.5
So far, have only played 7 player and 6 player games with many new players which have created games that go on far too long. I really need to play with a lower player count with experienced players to get a real feel for this.

From what I've gleaned, it is a hyper polished design. Oddly enough, it's almost too polished. It's difficult to explain, but games lose something when you know all the quirky eccentricities have been hunted down and squashed. There is an attempt to make up for it with the amazing art and setting. It's great, but during the game, I tend not to notice things like that.

I did enjoy the game though. There are multiple paths to get what you want and there are many difficult decisions. Luck is at a minimum. Though I was in groups with much too much downtime, I can see how the turns would be lightning quick in the right group. I wish there was a bit more player interaction though.

Definitely willing to give this another go at a proper player count. My thoughts are not final here yet.

8/7/16 - Finally played this, and will probably not play again. This a quite awfully dry euro that is trying very hard to be a big, chrome-y Ameri-trash game. The game has some serious issues.

The engine build euro just isn't that interesting. The biggest issue is that the game is too strategy restrictive. You are given at random a race with a fixed starting location, and an action board. Then until you build a mech or a building you can't move out of a three hex zone. Like all games with variable races you need to exploit your abilities best to win, but your starting location and action board could easily work against one another. 

It also seems to always take lots of little micro actions to do things. I realized during this play this is why I don't like Stonemaier games. They all have this quality to a certain extent. I developed my strategy early on, but executing it was tedious. Most turns were simply spent setting up other turns, which just seemed to make the game feel artificially long.

And oh man, this is a fiddly game. At this point I'm full under the impression that Jamey Stegmaier enjoys making cool components and now has a reputation to uphold by doing so. That is fully working against this game though. Like I said, this a pretty dry engine optimization game. I'm not opposed to engine optimization games, but when I look across the table at the vast sea of pieces and components I get deflated. Tracking the game state is a struggle. On top of the ocean of pieces is a mushy, brown-ish color palette that tends to was together and look like mud. The box are and player board art is tremendous, but during game play the board is a jumbled up unclear mess.

And yep, this a completely pasted on theme. Yep, there are minis, and mechs, and cool art. But it all amounts to nothing. This could be any theme, even a non-combat oriented theme. The combat is the one area where theme could have come through, but it's essentially a more restrictive and unexciting copy of the combat from Dune. The combat in Dune was thrilling because of all the intrigue elements at play. Here, even with the dial and the combat cards, most fights are largely deterministic. The cards don't do anything interesting, just add x strength.

All in all, not a game for me. Fiddly, overlong, annoyingly restrictive, and derivative. I feel like this game wants to be Concordia, but has crammed in a lot of bloat to be shiny. Concordia is simpler, more streamlined and economical, and plays much smoother and faster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Initial thoughts:  Gameplay is very streamlined, and mechanics feel solid.  There are a lot of little bits and pieces of rules and things, but none of it is difficult to grasp.  With 4 players, by the end of the game, we were already zipping through almost as if there was no downtime.

Scythe is an interesting exhibit of modern euro design tendencies. It has a lot of moving parts, and feels very baroque on one level. But on another everything flows well, and experience makes the whole thing feel more cohesive. It's a bit bloodless, and it has that constrained feeling euros embrace. But for what it is I like it pretty well.

Mixed feelings. Great artork, and superb storyline. And good mechanics too...  only if they just weren't a Frankenstein monster that has mixed elements from 6 other different games. If all the players are at a similar level, the starting possition + starting player sheet greatly determines the final result, which is a big pity for a game that has been able to balance all other elements so perfectly :-(

Took a while to get this to the table, and I definitely like it.  There's a lot of moving parts, and it takes a few turns to figure out the rhythm of play, and you need to be thinking two or three turns ahead, but that's my ideal planning horizon for games.  I really like the ergonomics and the UX of the game.  The way buildings and upgrade cubes clearly and visually track your technological progress by making your actions better and cheaper is really well designed, along with how as your worker population swells, it gets more expensive to get them to work.  The design of the pieces is great in that all the wooden bits are used for the eurogame mechanics, and the plastic bits are the ones that interact with the more ameritrash mechanics.  Combat is present, but you're not incentivized to go all-out, and the penalty for losing is comparatively mild.  I also like the design of the stars, as I like games that have multiple binary goals where you have to choose to pursue some of them and not others.  The clearly delineated nature of the list of goals also makes it clear what you should be doing during the game and serves as a teaching tool for new players, and having a lot of them gives you a broad strategy space where you can focus very differently in different plays of the game, guided by what your player board is good at doing.

This is another game that boost a great theme and great flavor on the paper and the cardboard, but after a couple of turns, going back and forth with the same action that gives you "command points" "popularity" or "money" feels just as lifeless as it sounds. It's jarring how much this game appears to have hidden depths and how much these fall flat when you get near to have build anything possible.
Moreover, i don't get all the emphasis this game puts in workers and mechs when the first aren't going to do anything special after the first turns (the only action directly tied with them is production, which is somehow quite situational), while the seconds aren't really going to have some real fights. It appears to me that this game real flaws are these: you got to do a lot of things, but nothing really interesting, and you got to see a lot of flavor, but never feel it in practice. Heck, when you want, or are invited, to have mech fights in a post-apocalyptic world, you would want to have REAL mech fights in a post-apocalyptic world, not to have mechs strolling around in cornfields while you watch how peaceful your farmers are sitting on their asses.
This recent trend of having badly designed Euro games that are...

1) Overcosted as they got tons of minis (nothing against those who likes them, but let's deal with it once and for all: good minis alone does not make a good game)
2) Disguised as an Ameritrash while having nigh to nothing of them

...got to stop sooner or later. One Blood Rage is enough, thanks.

Neither the area control game I expected when I crowdfunded it, way back, nor the empty balloon of a Euro I feared when the first reviews started appearing on BGG. The production value is insanely high, especially in the Collector's Edition, and it's a very thought through product (and game). Very good replay opportunities, almost unlimited strategies and turn choices, easily induces analysis paralysis, can be intimidating to casual/ameritrash players, clear rulebook but still difficult to grasp gameplay until you've tried it at least once, difficult to gauge player scoring during a game (which I see as a plus). Even though turns fly by and you easily complete a multiplayer game in under two hours, it feels kind of heavy and grognard-y. Which, in my book, is another bonus. I don't really like Euros. This game, I liked. And it's absolutely gorgeous too.

While this is a decent game, it didn't live up to the hype it got upon release.  The resource management portion is fine, but I didn't really find the fighting system or "resources stay on the space" portions all that interesting.  I also think I'd prefer if any given star position was limited to a single player in some way so the race element was even more pronounced.

Very hard to rate this one. Cool idea and trappings, although I don't need minis and stars and such to have a good time. Counters would have been fine. 

The movement rules about crossing rivers into only certain terrains are absolutely ridiculous; you often can't even go back the way you came. And you start so slowly in this game, it might be better to be equipped with a mech or workers something right out of the gate. Still, there are some cool things about this, like many things to do and paths to victory. Not bad for someone who's not into engine-building games.  

But it's a slow one to start, and has an over-large footprint, and if played with few players seems to provide very little interaction. With 4, 5, 6 players, though, it seems rife with potential.

I normally dislike games that fall on the 4X spectrum, but I saw this one on kickstarter and decided to back it and give it a shot because it seemed to have the few things I liked from other 4x games I've played (dial combat) and didn't have the things I hated (loss of units/high focus on combat). I was not disappointed in my choice once the game arrived. The game is mainly about building your engine as efficiently as possible while going after the objectives of getting your stars on the board and setting yourself up for a sweet number of points at the end of the game. Having to do that while worrying about what the other players might be up to and work around them is just a nice extra challenge. I look forward to playing this game many more times.

Hm, not so sure on this, though it might grow on me. Plusses are that there is very little downtime, and that this is multi-player terrain exploitation with a bit of combat that keeps the gloves on.

Nice components, though the leaders and their pets put me off - would have much preferred a Boss Mech.

Like Jamey Stegmaier's other games the production value for Scythe is through the roof and it looks great on the table. Scythe is a fun efficiency puzzle to solve and compares well to other popular efficiency games like Terra Mystica or Tzolkin.

Scythe is a good game built on a euro engine and the threat of combat with a player driven end game. I don't personally like the solo game very much, but then, I don't like solo versions of games where the dummy player mostly serves as a timer.

Invaders from Afar is essential, and I'm excited to get the next two expansions!

Scythe is probably better than I rated it, if you haven't played the various games Scythe borrows from. Play it just made me want to play them. What Scythe does in two hours is admirable but I felt I was just scratching the surface of a larger game at the end. Would give it another go however.

If you think the combat in this game is good, do yourself a favor and play Rex, or better still, Dune. Then you see the combat sing and the result will actually mean something.

RATING: 7.5
FUN ★★★✰✰
I'm not sure whether it could be called "fun", but for sure this game provides some kind of interest. The issue I see here is the lack of interaction between the players. Each of them developp its faction for 2/3 of the game before we can feel more tension raising due to the scores and positions on the map. Despite of that, I enjoy putting the game on the table with friends. Don't expect to have many battles on the map, the mechs are more a threat than a means to kill other characters.

RULES ★★★★★
Rules are very well written, special cases are very easy to handle because they are easy to find in the rule book. I read them only once and we didn't have any issue to play seemlessly.

IMMERSION ★★★✰✰
I mostly play historical games. It's hard to define this one as such, but the design, the cards, the atmosphere are very special and put the players in a particular world. Very well done.

DEPTH ★★★✰✰
Along with the lack of interaction, this is the second negative point to this game that I could find. I am not sure to want to play this that often. The game is nice, but I'm afraid it would become quite repetitive on the long term once the optimal schemes found. We'll see.

Every time I play this game is an enjoyable experience. There's a great deal of variability within the constraints of the design, and it's fascinating to me how much the end-game board state varies from game to game. The automata is good for solo play, and I enjoy the experience even with just 2 players.

Super fun Euro-Ameritrash hybrid. While the infrequent combat may not be the most exciting, it does feel really meaningful. It's a lot like Rex\Dune's combat with some cards and a power dial. The components are fantastic and the Euro-engine is some of the best anywhere.

Superb package - great game, beautiful components - and I only have the retail edition! The game plays smoothly - looks complex at set up time, but this is a bit of an illusion - the rules are not at all difficult to follow, and newbies will be playing with confidence, a few turns in. That's not to say that strategy is easy to master - I imagine that players will improve with experience, and more experience of this superb game is my immediate objective right now!

Most options ingame usually have one optimal solution, so you don't really get much choices throughout the game. You get your starting combo at the beginning that limits you from doing certain strategies, even with later upgrades, leaving you one or two options to choose from, unless you intend to lose. This is also true for things like encounter cards: certain "choices" are not real choices, since the tradeback is that awful (especially if you have to give up hearts) you'll never choose certain things unless you're a beginner. In the first round you already know your first 15 rounds. It is a rare occasion that something changes during your turns, since player interactions are so scarce, and battles usually punish you, even tough one side usually unable to do anything: the attacker KNOWS for sure the outcome before the fight... If you have a new player this is even more tedious: your rounds are only 10 second long, with 10-15 minutes of pause between them. I'm confused: it is supposed to be a board game, yet it is almost like a slow and limited version of a single player pc game of a similar genre.

I know how popular this game is.

And I love games with multiple paths to victory.

My biggest beef with this game is the component quality, mainly the double cardboard that is poorlymade, and either breaks apart or completely warps. Making playing the game a bigger challenge than it has to be.

I am also privy to the fact that the people i played with factors in to this rating, but boy this game bored me and all the many times I had to sit and do booring rounds of Produce, next player and then waiting for the AP prone players before it was my turn again, while im bored shitless... I hope that this game will work well for others, and I know it does, but I have to say I am happy i didn't end up buying this game myself.

Wrote a first impressions on this one. Mainly, the game is deceptive about what it actually is. If you are interested in a 4x game, or a Kemet-like experience, skip this game. It is an engine builder. There is little player interaction. The engine does not seem very interesting to replay as it clearly tells you what it wants you to do. There is no sense of progression or any stories that come forth out of playing it. All things considered, it is a forgettable experience. For every game it is inspired by, you are better off just playing its inspirations and have a far better time.

Scythe has been on my solo table every month since I got it.
To me it is the ultimate solo game, purely because I always want to play it.
Some reasoning behind that need:
1. Variety in factions - you can try out the different abilities and see how they interact with the playerboards. (finding workable strategies).
2. Variety in player boards - This can totally change what you need to do and how you manage your faction.
3. Variety in Automa difficulty - This will alter your strategy if only because the most significant change is time.
4. Variety in Automa actions - depending on the Automa card reveal, it can behave aggressively, expansively or defensively, each requiring a different solution.
5. Variety in Automa numbers - providing you can get extra decks or the app, you can play against 1 to 3 Automa for an enjoyable game. 4+ is a lot of work, but still fun! 
6. Variety in Events - not as powerful, but still a fun discovery process and a fantastic opportunity to deal it out to the Automa/s.
7. Variety in Structure Bonus - a simple Bonus that often changes a Loss into a win.

I know it won't suit everyone, and other games may fill some of the same aspects better.
But I it is a comprehensive game with a lot to like.

As an eurogame lover, I find this game very interesting and unique in comparison with the rest of my collection. It has all the elements that I like in a game (resource management, optimization of actions, engine building, etc.) but it adds other tings like combat and player confrontation over the map without making it it's main focus.

Overall the result is fantastic, this is a game that feels really special when you play it thanks to it's amazing components, art and unique combination of euro and 4X mechanics.

If you like eurogames and want to experience something with more player interaction, don't think about it and get Scythe right now.

Upon first seeing this KS I thought it would be the perfect marriage of Euro and Ameritrash. Alas it was falsely marketed as 4X, but it's just a Euro. Nothing wrong with what it is, it's just not what they said it would be.

A nice balance of area control + resource conversion mechanisms. The production quality is top notch. The rules are decently streamlined. Still, the game play feels a little inelegant - the faction asymmetries are in the details, making your game choices quite tied to the faction you start with. I can see why a lot of people love it, but falls a little short for me.

RATING: 5
Lots of points for style.  It really isn't window dressing: the theme fresh and it infused the game.  The concept and art are supercool.

There's also a couple of innovative mechanisms:  1)  the fact that you can sometimes take two actions on your turn if you planned things right (and no one foiled them).  2)  the upgrade mechanism of making one action more effective while simultaneously making another action cost less was great and provides for a lot of strategy.

But I'm afraid there aren't enough nice trees to add up to a forest.  Many mechanisms (movement, combat and the flow of controlling territory) are clunky and chaotic.  The way the game ends is simply unsatisfying.  The variable powers didn't sit right for me and seems a cheap way to get flavor and replayability at the expense of undue complexity and arguments about fairness.

There are also downtime issues...but I'm going to chalk this up to my poor patience and the fact that I've only played five player.

RATING: 7
I don't like that the "bottom-row actions" on the player boards become useless in the later part of the game. For example when you have built all your buildings, the build action is then pointless. Unfortunately this is true for ALL the bottom-row actions. Why can you do less after you developed your faction? This aspect of gameplay is highly unsatisfying for me. I will have to play the game a couple more times to see if this really bothers me.

Yes, you can keep using the bottom-row actions just for the money / bonuses, but they cost the same as if using them fully, which makes no sense: "So I use a build action paying materials required to build a building that I do not build. And then I get money."
This could be solved simply by "unlocking" some special ability or bonus when completing a bottom-row action.

I also don't like the game's combat system which I find too deterministic and boring.

RATING: 5
The theme is original and interesting, but the game system is too derivative in my opinion. I've simply played too many similar games (TI3, Eclipse, Throneworld) with a hex board, resource collection, army building, a central "super hex", victory points through achievements, and so on. All of these games have a few unique rules of course, but they still play the same overall. Similar to TI3 the board gets quite crowded and there's too much "stuff" than is necessary to what the game is trying to achieve. It also seems like the game ending/winning move should always be the same, unless I'm missing something.

A Kaszára is sor került végre. Óriási rajongás övezete a játékot a megjelenése óta. A történet szerint az első világháború után járunk, amikor a fejlődés a lépegetők fejlesztése felé ment el. A játékosok területeket szereznek a hexás térképen és közben fejlődnek. Különböző fejlesztésekért, maximalizált haderőért, hírnévért lehet csillagokat szerezni, amiből ha valaki hatot megszerez kiváltja a játék végét azonnal, de egyáltalá nem biztos, hogy ő nyer, mert a csillagok számán kívül a birtokolt terület, nyersanyagaink és a minden játékban véletlenszerűen választott cél elérése is pénzt ad. A játékban bár lehet és csillagért érdemes is harcolni, viszonylag kevés a háború, így a nagy konfliktusosságtól nem kell félni. A játék bolti kiadása is nagyon szép, de a KS verzió hihetetlen gyönyörűen kivitelezett. A játékban mindenki egy-egy népet testesít meg és egy-egy véletlenszerű fejlődési akicótáblát is kap. E kettő jó kihasználása a játék kulcsa. És talán ez az egyetlen gyenge pont is, mert úgy érzem, hogy az egyes kombinációk nem teljesen kiegyensúlyozottak. A játék meglepően gyors. Jogos a rajongás, a Scythe jól sikerült játék, nagyon szép köntösben.

I have played this game twice now and both times I had a terrible experience playing. The game would have been amazing if it did not have combat in it, but I feel as though the combat is a slippery slope to fight on.

You need to defend yourself, so you fight. But to do, you need to blow all of your might (which in turn is actually vp) to win a battle. After winning the battle, you notice that you have become an easy target, all because you needed to stop your goods from getting lost. 

Or you could use your goods. But wait, you cant because you just took that action, or worse, its a coin action and mind you, coins are VP.

My experience was so bad, I wont ever play this game again. I think it was a flaming pile of garbage. And only 1 game so far had topped it in terribleness : spinning monkeys. But not too far behind is marco polo.

Played a 5P game once. It's a 5 for me so far. Might change score if I get a chance to play it again. 

The art is nice but doesn't really add much to the game experience imo. 

The theme, to me, is almost non-existent in this game. It didn't make me understand the rules/mechanism  of the game easier at all. The goal of the game is to get the most fame & wealth but I felt like the objectives we needed to achieve that are very arbitrary. (e.g. Deploy all 4 Mechs, Complete all 6 Upgrades, build structure on some predefined locations). Why deploying more Mech upgrades my ability to move around on the map? Why do I gain stuffs when the players next to me do the bottom action that I have already enlisted? The whole thing just feels unthematic to me. 

A game can be fun without any theme, but when the game try to force a theme on itself and utterly failed (imo), it gets some minus points.

I also agree with other negative reviews that say it could feel like a multiplayer solitaire (from the only 5p game i played anyway). Judging the game without the theme, the game play itself pretty average. Nothing I haven't see from other games. The implementation of the mechanic is alright.

Resisted giving any game a 10, because they can always be better, right?  But after 20 or so plays of Scythe it remains not only my favorite but my teenage kids' favorite as well.  There was a time 3 or 4 plays in when I was worried it was getting stale, but then a new level of depth appeared and hasn't let up.

Two things make this game great, besides the stellar art and top flight components.  One, everything is logical and well thought out with tie-ins to the theme.  Two, figuring out your action board is a fun puzzle every time (and with 5 factions and 5 player boards, there are a lot of combinations - 7 of each with the first expansion).  Unique in any game I've played, you select an action which is chained to another action (e.g., move, then build; or produce resources then deploy a mechanized unit), but the chaining is unique to each player (another may have produce with build).  Actions can have costs, so you may not be able to execute both actions in your turn, and the strategy of planning a couple of moves ahead to be able to maximize both actions keeps you thinking all the time, with lots of satisfying moments when you can pull it off.

I could do a longer review here, as there's so much to like.  I expect Scythe will continue to be our go-to weekend game.

Terra Mystica + Kemet? Yes Please. The combat system is awful though.On first look its like Kemet/Game of Thrones, however Kemet has unique player powers that builds as the game progresses,and Game of thrones players has asymmetric power cards. Except for some very minor variation in the form of Mech upgrades, the Combat is just summation of cards + power dial numbers. Seriously, it bothers me that this game is praised so much but it has one of the most uninspired combat mechanics I have ever seen.

Played it twice on Tabletopia. Didn't really grab me in any way. The design is ok I guess and the game works for sure. It just didn't excite me in any way.
Often felt like you were doing pretty much the same thing over and over again with a few variations. Nothing really spectacular happened during the game.

 
- Most of the upgrades were lackluster and the gains are very incremental. Move a cube from there to here and get a discount. The same goes for the buildings. The Mine is cool but the Monument and Armoury are very meh. 

- Also, popularity seems to be almost too important. The fact that you loose popularity everytime you force someone elses workers to retreat makes combat very difficult. Unless you're the white player, who doesn't get that penalty.   

Didn't like the endgame either. It get's kinda mathy when you have to calculate the other players scores, to make any judgement, wether to take the last star to end the game or not.

Theme is pretty thin. The encounter cards are cool, but they are pretty much the only element in the game that supports the theme.

I really wanted to like the game, but in the end it just didn't bring anything new or exciting to the table.

Absolutely stunning production quality. Takes up quite a lot of table space but it does it in style. Despite all the pieces and what looks like a very heavy difficult game it's actually quite easy to teach/learn and jump right into. Having said that, the strategies involved are interesting and varied and there's a lot of variation between games depending on board/army combos, factory cards, objectives, etc. My favorite new game in a long time.

I really enjoyed my first play of this game. It's not the most sophisticated 4x, but I find the mechanics easy to grasp and I am sure some of my friends who normally don't play 4x games could easily wrap their heads around it. The components and art are stunning, and the game plays really fast. Multiple paths to victory and objectives to complete add more to the game. And while I have read that some people are dissatisfied with the lack of focus on combat, I like it, since usually in 4x games I always fall behind because I don't focus on combat enough...I like developing instead. So, this game is my cup of tea. :)

Scythe combines many of the "mech"anisms that I enjoy: player powers, hex control, resource management, and combat.  Obviously the artwork is in a class of its own; simply astounding.  The components in the Collector's Edition are excellent.  The game is full of tension and tough decisions, and it has a nice growth to its gameplay as it builds to a nail biting conclusion.  Stonemaier Games has another winner in Scythe.

If "Hansa Teutonica" and "Dune" had a baby, and that baby grew up to be kinda bloated and clumsy, but was really, really, ridiculously good looking, it would be "Scythe."

"Scythe" is undeniably one of the best looking games out there. Maybe THE best looking. Jakub Różalski artwork is impeccably gorgeous.

The biggest problem with "Scythe" is that the disparate mechanisms of the game constantly clash with each other.

The combat mechanism actively discourages conflict, as even if you win a conflict, by spending the resources required to do so you've weakened yourself. But then winning a battle is an easy way to get a star on the board, so you're going to want to fight an easy battle once.

And really those stars are the crux of the game. Once someone achieves their final star the game is over. So "Scythe" isn't really a 4x game. It's a racing game. Can you build an engine to get stars on the board faster than the other players?

The popularity track makes those stars worth more than anything else in the game. I've never seen someone win who wasn't in the top tier of popularity.

The secret objective cards are strange. Each player draws 2 at random before the game begins, maybe they're easy to complete, maybe they're nigh impossible, there is no way to obtain more so you better hope you're lucky. You're going to want to complete one because doing so gives you a star. If you do complete one you discard the other. Since there's no way to draw more of these, why is there a spot for the whole deck on the board?

I digress...

"Scythe" is NOT a bad game. But everything it does has been done better in other games. Maybe not all in the same game, but perhaps there's a reason for that.

Sure looks good though.

Scythe for me brings together my gaming experiences as a child (Risk) with my newer gaming experiences (Catan), yet also making it more competitive and more strategy based, less on luck.

The theming of the game is excellent, the symbols used are clear, and it is probably one of the few games that took over two hours the first time and left my entire group saying "Wow, can we play that again?". 

While it can be difficult to start out, especially with some more fiddly rules (Took me 3 games before I fully understood the Windmill), it is a game that learning the rules feels rewarding, and makes you want to play again.

This is another comment I wish I would have added closer to my play of the game, so this may be revised. There was some really nice engine-building here and certainly encouragement for combat without making it overly punitive to the loser. The choices seemed interesting, and there was plenty of tension out there. I'd like to play this again soon.

RATING: 7
A fun, but (in my opinion) greatly overrated game. While there is a great amount of strategy, it is at the end of the day a worker placement/zone control/economy Euro. Sure, it has some extra bells and whistles, and due to its unprecedented success on kickstarter looks very pretty, but at the end of the day it can be very plodding, slow, and not all that engaging. There are a couple very optimal ways to play, and the various factions/factory cards don't alter that terribly much. 

Overall, it is undoubtedly a very solid game, but its ranking is greatly overinflated simply due to the bandwagon popularity of it following its kickstarter. I highly recommend anyone that is thinking about buying this game to first try it: play it a few times at your FLGS if they have a demo copy. If you love it, great, but don't be surprised if you come away from it thinking "Sure, that was fun, but am I missing something? Why all the hype?"

My exact opinion of this game is summarized pretty perfectly by Paul in the Shut Up and Sit Down review, easily found on YouTube.

Gorgeous game, great components, cool unique player powers ... mostly a resource-management euro with just a bit of combat if you want it. Solid game, and I've played the automa several times, but I just haven't found it especially compelling. A major part of the game seems to be analyzing your random setup and coming up with the best strategy based on that. Of course you do have to react to what your opponents are doing, but I think I'd prefer even more of that. And the thematic stuff, the little stories on the encounter cards, are completely irrelevant to me.

Fantastic strategy-optimization game with awesome art and build quality. After 10 plays I still have a lot to learn as there are so many different strategies that can be applied to win this game.

Mind though that there is little element of luck in the game, so there is IMHO a strong correlation between skill and number of wins (preferably play with players of the same skill level or those with lower skill are going to get bored of losing all the time).

This game is an area control and faction management game with little splashes of tons of other mechanics added to it.  There is some exploration, combat, and hidden objectives sprinkled in here as well as tons of other stuff.

This game absolutely blew me away.  I had a feeling and actually splurged for the second best edition of the game which included everything except the art book and even not getting that is seeming like a mistake with how beautiful this game is.  While we are on the subject let's talk about the game's art.  It seems like a great place to start because the story I've heard is this game came into being based solely on the beautiful art by Jakub Rozalski.  The designer wanted to use that art in a game and built around it.  On top of which with the Deluxe edition of the game I have a board extension to make the board even larger, nice chunky resource tokens to replace the cardboard, and metal coins.  The game looks absolutely amazing and there is a different piece of artwork on each of the encounter cards.  My personal favorite part is the pairing of this beautiful artwork with humorous satirical descriptions of your options when you draw an encounter card.  Everything from gaining popularity for your long, flowing hair fluttering in the wind to pushing an innocent cow under a marauding mech.

So enough about how the game looks, how does it play?  Incredible.  Which I have to admit when I heard that the game started with art and the gameplay was built around that I was somewhat skeptical.  But the game is almost perfectly designed.  First of all each player has their own faction and player board.  These vary slightly to greatly depending on what portion you look at but they all seem pretty well balanced.  That is not a minor task, being able to offer depth and breadth in play so the game has replayability while also balancing it all.  On top of which with so many of those mechanics sprinkled in there are a ton of ways to approach the game and win.  Something that stood out is in my first game I placed the final achievement star which immediately ends the game.  In theory this meant I did more than my two opponents, my closest competitor still had 2 fewer than me.  I still only came in second however.  There is a popularity track that gives more points based on the tier you are in and I was one tier lower.  Even with "doing less" he got more value out of what he did and beat me.  I lost but I love that the game doesn't have a runaway leader or lock to it that many other, even good, games have.  That is something else  very, very hard to design for.

Between just wanting to stare at this game and all the many ways you can play and the variability and replayability it offers this has immediately become one of my favorite games.

Wow, truly living up to its hype for me, I didn't expect ti like it this much, mu husband was more interested and without that I don't think we would have gotten this game. The fighting is as tiny as I can tolerate it in a Euro game and the worker placement and scoring is executed really nicely. Love the encounter cards, they throw some funny thematic depth into the game which Euros admittedly can lack. All around really impressed, and I know people say you should get the deluxe version but I already find the looks quite impressive.

Lush production, Lovely theme, pedestrian and spoddy game play.  'wURO' but with a lower case and unsounded 'w'.  Most action is of  heads down own tableau self absorption type, there might be a little bit of combat to score a VP but those Mechs are really there just to add a few gig of ram to the spreadsheet calculations of how to min/max your way to 6vp. I would have loved this is 2009. 5 might be generous.

RATING: 7.4
Scythe is a fine game but it's not an exciting one. It doesn't have any glaring flaws, but just a bunch of minor ones. The biggest reason that I am not a huge fan is because it's a game that sets you up for so much, but ends up disappointing.

For example, the artwork and theme are so beautiful and have you believe that it's a thematic 4x game with combat and exciting swings, but really it's a slow resource generation game that could have been completely abstracted from its theme without any consequence. The split objectives are disconnected and make conflict between players feel arbitrary and meaningless, because other than the few moments of combat or vying for the factory in the center, there is rarely a shared objective that everyone is competing for so everyone is essentially in their own worlds.

When the end game is finally triggered, to me it feels anticlimactic, abrupt, and disappointing. No one realizes until a turn or two before the end of the game (and sometimes not until the game is over) that the game is going to end. I think it has to do with the disconnected objectives mentioned above

Lastly, the pace of the game is disappointing because of how slow it is throughout the whole game. There is no ramp up in Scythe. You basically take the same actions throughout the whole game. Upgrades and enlist options help a bit but not enough to make up for the slow pace. The game just plods along and then all of a sudden it's over. 

I think on paper it's a fine game. It plays well enough. It has a lot of interdependencies and there is some fun in trying to optimize your actions, but I never get sucked into it. At no point does it feel exciting or, for that matter, fun. Just my opinion.

My rating is based on the first play of the game, but I suspect that it would go up with further plays.

I really enjoy that this game gives opportunity to have conflict but doing so negatively effects the winner. I also like that the random assignment of faction and player mat can reduce the opportunity for someone to come into the game with a planned path to victory. I feel the game will present a number of push your luck opportunities where gaining all your stars first will be something left to other players as you fortify and build income and resources for the final scoring. I think that with the right group of people this could be a very long lasting game.

Scythe is one of the most beautifully designed board games I've ever seen. The theme and aesthetic are completely unique. The art is unlike anything out there. The mechanisms perfectly reflect the world they are set in, immersing the players in it at a deep level. The level of complexity means it takes time to explain the rules to new players, but it has plenty of visual and mechanical cues cleverly built in to help players remember everything.

This game has it all, and it's beautiful. Stonemaier Games is great. I emailed them and they were so friendly. Scythe has mechanics and elements from some of my favorite games, like Dungeon Lords, Puerto Rico and Catan. 

I played the KS edition and luckily was able to purchase an extra KS Deluxe version before they were all sold out. I have so far only played once, with advanced tabletop gamers, I consider myself an intermediate tabletop gamer. With the many variables, I believe that little luck is involved here. Managing dependencies, and choosing stretgies to achieve star goals is challenging. 

Each faction / player board has variation giving clear strength variation. 

One addition I would make is to add a player reference card that shows scoring system for star achievements. I took a photo of the Quick Start Guide to use as a reference while playing the game for the first time. 

Figurines are paintable.

RATING: 6
Scythe is a beautiful game with some interesting mechanisms, but it lacks  interaction and the end scoring system is anti-climactic.

The artwork in Scythe is instantly engaging.  Every inch of the board is beautiful and the cards and player faction mats pop with gorgeous thematic elements.  This is among my top games, visually.  Once you move beyond the artwork, the game sports a decent amount of icons that can make the rules seem imposing.  Fortunately learning the game is rather painless and the flow of the game lends itself well to learning as you play.  The main action mechanic of top action first then bottom is interesting, especially with the variable boards.  Each turn of Scythe gives you challenging decisions to make as you weigh top and bottom action combinations.  You must also consider that you can never do the same action in back-to-back turns (barring one faction ability) which leads to longer term planning, although this restriction seems somewhat forced just to make the game seem deeper.  Actions and mechanics are streamlined and play quickly, which helps minimize downtime (AP still can be a factor).  These qualities make Scythe a very engaging experience, and yet...

I can't really bring my self to praise Scythe thanks to the lack of interaction, the awful combat, and the obscure scoring system that completely clashes with the very nature of the rest of them game.  Scythe starts slow and movement is plodding.  With so many actions focused on improving your own faction, and the various options to essentially trade any good for any other through various actions, players will generally hang out in or near their starting areas for 80% of the game and just bounce between actions to improve themselves in the quest for 6 stars.  Each game will see people racing to getting 4 mechs, 4 enlistments, 6 upgrades, max dominance, and the other stars that can be achieved on a completely solitary basis.  I've found the game to be 4 people staring at their player boards and generally ignoring each other until the last few turns.  

Once interaction does occur, it happens through what the game generously refers to as combat.  Combat involves spending a secret amount of dominance and adding one combat card (if you have any) per combat unit with which you are attacking.  Add up the numbers to see who wins, attacker wins ties.  In fairness, there is the interesting choice to consider in which you may hold back everything in hopes that your opponent blows all his cards and dominance to beat you when you didn't mind losing, but the experience is otherwise disappointing.  Mechs and characters do nothing but add combat cards IF you have them in hand.  They offer no other benefit in combat, which really highlights that the mechs themselves are basically just another solitaire upgrade system in the game.  And otherwise, the super-simple system is just boring.  There's no real way to become a powerful and looming threat in Scythe.  There's no tactical positioning or protecting valuable hexes.  Because combat depends primarily on dominance and cards, your status on the map is almost entirely divorced from your ability to attack or defend based on unit positioning.  Attackers also usually suffer popularity penalties and there are almost no hexes that don't have an equivalent alternative within an easily reachable distance.  Add all of this up and combat generally only happens so that players can grab two of the needed six stars, which is an uninteresting reason to fight.  

Finally, and most unfortunately, the ultimate win condition in Scythe is atrocious.  After 2+ hours of building your faction, securing hexes and materials and gaining dominance and popularity, all done on a perfect information board that constantly displays player status and gives you a sense of faction progression, the game suddenly ends and then every faction sits down to do some math and figure out what their actual score was!  It turns out, the star race never really mattered (though it does provide points).  Instead, if a player has a mathematically optimized position in which his popularity multipliers combined with his stars, hexes, and materials plus some bonus conditions is the highest, he wins!  This scoring is a slap to the face, seriously.  It is terribly unsatisfying.  Two hours of building and upgrading and racing for objectives suddenly slams to a halt and everyone crosses their fingers in the hopes that their numbers add up the best.  I'm having trouble describing the frustration I've felt during scoring this game.  A close game isn't defined by a single battle on the last turn or a brilliant series of upgrades and moves, or conquering that last game long objective, it's determined by the red player having (numbers completely made up) 2x10+3x7+5x5 = 66  and blue having 3x8 + 2x10 + 2x10 = 64.  OH MAN SO CLOSE!  Ugh.

The relative solitude of this game, combined with my complete lack of desire to fight, and culminating in an obfuscated and unsatisfying scoring system, make Scythe a repetitive and unsatisfying overall experience.  Each game is a race to upgrade, which usually happens in the same general way, and then someone wins, somehow.  That's not to say it's boring.  Making the decisions on how to upgrade most efficiently is actually quite interesting, and after all else fails it's still pretty to look at.  I don't hate Scythe, and I really appreciate it's streamlined mechanics.  I'll still play it, but I won't ask to.

I waited a long time to get this to the table. Was is worth the wait? Yes...and no. A great game it definitely is. It is super well designed and plays so smoothly. But, it always leaves me wanting to play it for just a little bit longer. There is never enough time to get your engine up and running and it seems as though the last few rounds are just point grabs which, sometimes, bothers me.

Terrible with two players.

A functional design but I can't see anybody who've been gaming for more than a decade being excited by this. Like most Stonemaier game, it's a rehash of stuff you've seen hundreds of time better before. Nothing particularly innovative here.

I'll admit I don't get the theme at all. Artwork is nice, but not particularly evocative. To me Caylus has a better theme than Scythe.

My major complains for the game is the way you get stars, which is about players maxing 6 categories. It makes for very linear gameplay outside the threat of an attack.

Again not a bad game, but rating on BGG scale means I have little interest of playing this again.

Looks Great, Great Theme, problem is the game is very solo play.

I've played this game 7x times now and have got to admit for the first 3x games i thought ooh this is interesting but now i know the rules and have played it a fair few times I've got to say the game is quite dull.

You're nearly always solo playing, the random clan and distribution board can be make or break and some locations lean towards resources better than others, The game feels too self absorbed and with the combat mechanic it's rare to see too many people fighting for the win.

I'd play this game again but it's not as good as the hype train makes you believe, in summary it's a simplified version of Terra Mystica with random mechanics and no real serious play testing.

RATING: 9
This might actually be a 10 for me. I'm a few plays in and would like to play it quite a bit more. I enjoy the efficiency puzzle and the race in each game and am still getting a feel for the different factions and strategies. The game does a good job of encouraging exploration and conflict in various ways without every seeming to penalize a given player randomly.

I do worry that with repeat plays, there may be a few formulaic moves that prove to be much stronger than others, especially for individual factions. This could lead to a bit of sameness between matches. The randomized player mats do help alleviate this to a certain extent, however, as their strongest actions will frequently not match up with your factions strongest abilities or most readily available resources.

Whether with other gamers or against the Automa in solo mode, I am finding Scythe to be incredibly challenging and rewarding. An atypical 4X in that it emphasizes combat (and never eliminates units), it offers a plethora of choices and decisions only get harder (and the right ones more rewarding) as the game goes on. It's already crept from 8.5 to 9 in my estimation and once I give The Wind Gambit a try it could very well climb more.

RATING: 6
Clever design that mixes euro efficiency (action selection, engine-building, victory by completing X achievements) with diceless combat. The complaint, as ever, is that like most hybrid designs it is unsatisfying on all fronts -- too much randomness for a strategic euro and too little action for dudes on a map. It's a game I desperately want to like and I can see why it's popular, but just like Eclipse I think I have to resign myself to the fact that it's never going to be as enjoyable as I want it to be.

It's quite a hodgepodge and some parts work better than others. Resource production is cleverly tied to the area control, for example, and the shared (thievable!) resources adds another great incentive besides stars to fight. The recruitment bonus granted by adjacent players does not seem similarly necessary (or, rather, seems included to add a modicum more interest in other players actions but as mechanism feels inorganic and bolted-on). I'm not particularly convinced by the action boards in general, really (uninteresting choices about action efficiency to distract from the insufficiently compelling map), and particularly not by the asymmetry, as some combinations seem to play much better to specific faction strengths.

There is also undeniable luck in the various card draws.

Jakub Rozalski's spectacular artwork is the best reason to play, but cheaper to buy a print or an artbook.

Tentative rating that I could see going up after a few plays.  There are a number of interesting ideas here, and the game pieces and boards are fantastic.  I don't really like how the end game works out, as it is too calculable, and it bogs down the game.  I'm not sure how I feel about most games that end when a player chooses to end it.  Often, like in the case in our play, they end it and someone else wins.  In order to combat that, a player might and probably should take an awful long time calculating out how not to have that happen.  

It felt too long, but I could very much see that problem being more group dependent.  4 seemed like the right number of players.  I liked aspects of it enough to play some more, but it may just not be my type of war game/Euro hybrid.  I'd rather play Eclipse for more 4x action or Kemet to pare down the complexity to just murdering my opponents nonstop.

Scythe’s beauty and theme really adds to the game experience. It is an efficiency race to build up as much as possible before a player ends the game. 

The first half of the game feels like a solitaire puzzle where the players build the foundation of their strategy to win. It is crucial that you right from the start have a plan for your first 3 - 4 stars and how to get there as fast as possible. For this you need to optimize the usage of your bottom row actions. Take too many single actions (top row only) and you fall behind.

The second half of the game opens up interaction with the other players. Try to be the player who ends the game with the move action and spread out to as many territories as possible. Otherwise keep an eye on the player that will and spread out just before they place their last star.

Each faction paired with different action boards give you a new puzzle to solve which I enjoy. Had a really good time playing it and would love to give it another go.

My rating is only for one-player since I haven't been able to bring it to the table with friends. The fun I've had playing against a deck of cards (Automa) tells me this game is something special. It has much to offer in terms of replayability, strategy and multiple game mechanics. I enjoy the combat as much as the tension of possible combat. The beautiful art and upgraded metal coins really make the game feel special. 

I'll update this rating once I've played more with friends but as it stands, I love playing Scythe.

Decent 4X-ish game that is fun and interesting. My main problems with the game is the samey feel between games. Usually it seems the best tactics are to create a strong synergy between your faction boards and simply push for that as hard as possible. Buildings seem a bit useless in general unless it is part of the objective mission and easy to get to. I'm looking forward to the expansion to see what new things it adds to mix it up, but I'm starting to get tired of it after only 3 plays. Highest score was 72 in a 4 player game with experienced players -- some factions seem really strong in shooting for high score strategies, especially if you get the right mission cards.

Almost universally loved! $110. But 2016 not the best for outstanding games.

For me, the classic game Wallenstein is far more interesting and just plain more fun. It does what Scythe essentially does but only in a far more interactive and fun manner. And in a more realistic manner, too. The game play and the theme interact perfectly! From the very beginning to the very end. Thus the players get territory that can be all over the map and next to your enemies. Some players may try to "turtle" quickly. But everyone is playing close attention to the map, both where they are and where the others are. Almost immediately some form of negotiating takes place. As players whose territories either are not near each other discuss how to work together against their more natural enemies whose territories are close to their own, as well as players whose territories might be inclined for combat and conquest try to divide up the board and turn attention to potentially easier territories, allowing the players to focus on building up castles, churches, and trading posts in their own territories for VPs. And, of course, the actual combat is "epic". Using the Tower. Where unexpected outcomes can happen. And where peasant forces may either fight with you or against you. Then there is the fact that you have to both tax and feed your populations. Choosing those specific areas from which taxes and food will be taken, which makes the peasants mad at you. Make them mad enough, and they revolt. And if you can't feed all your people, they'll start revolting. And just as in Scythe, you are limited in time, money, and resources. You can't either pay for all you want to buy (both guns and butter, so to speak, as controlling areas is worth VPs so you want big armies, but building castles, churches, and trading posts also earns VPs).
*********************
I came in the game with the wrong expectations. I was hoping for a game like Kemet, and got a functional victory point generator game like Seasons. The art is stunning, but the experience itself was not on par. Every time something was explained, I felt like I had seen this somewhere else before, and often better executed. I really missed having a story to tell about my Nords. Overall, I think despite its flaws, this game is still pretty good. It is competent, but somewhat bland and overshadowed by similar, better games. If you are new to boardgaming and want to try a more complicated game, this could be a good starting point. 
For everyone else, I would recommend leaving this one in the stores unless if you are really enamoured by the theme and the art. There are just better games in its genre out there. For 4X, try Space empires 4x or FF's Civilization. For area control and better combat, go play Kemet, Forbidden stars or Chaos in the old world. Or if you want something not quite like all of the above, but probably the most similar to to Scythe, but better, go play Eclipse and its expansion.

So simple but at the same time so deep.  There is a lot of strategy to be had in this game, so much planning and intricate detail to understand about each individual faction.  The differentiation in starting location in and of itself is going to inherently change how you play, and then there are asymmetrical powers, abilities and game boards.  I really enjoyed this game, and would like to play it again sooner than later, need to beat Chuck!

Second play through was just as good.  Saxony (black) is not exactly the faction that matches my play style, as it promotes confrontation and attacking.  Was able to take advantage of a player that consistently left himself and his resources vulnerable, which was unfortunate but from my perspective necessary.  I still had to learn as i was going and am far far from efficiently using my actions and resources.  Still need to play more.

With a group of 3 sharp and focused players, we raced against the clock. The store close time approaching in 130min, we had to learn the game and storm through it. So, motivated as we were, we stumbled through our early turns, missing opportunities and reading rules during each others turns, by 1/4 of the way through, we'd comprehended most of the rules and many others, we applied logic and checked after, finding ourselves correct(bonus points, the rules make sense). 

Having skipped the Quick Play Setup page, we had distributed factions by "pick the animal you think is cool"(incorrectly) and then cluelessly distributed the lower boards at random(correctly!)

Turns disappeared quickly. One player, in his enthusiasm jumped into his turn before the previous player had started theirs, not once, but three times.

At the end, despite time spent on setup and rules, we pulled in only 5 minutes past our limit. The store owner didn't mind, and for his trouble, I bought the expansion to Scythe on the spot.


On my second play, it was myself and 4 fresh players, three of whom were inattentive and insisted that rules hadn't been explained. Thankfully, I was able to call on the players who had had those rules explained to them to back me up.

I would recommend only 2 new players per game, or hardcore gamers only for large fresh groups.

Had done 3 games thus far. All just with the base 5 factions. The 3rd game was played with recurring players who had played previously.

Scythe has kind of a weird feeling for me. On one hand, I like the presentation and it's definitely an overall amazing production. The rules are tight and easy for new players to get into. There's always various decisions to make during the course of the game, and the game plays fast, with players only doing a single action per turn it rounds-about fast.

On the other hand, it's extremely close to the good fun of "I've so much to do but so little actions" that some players may not enjoy. A few other things bug me as well, with how the game pacing went from building up and following some kind of player strategy at the start, to jostling to position and stuff, then the end is just mindlessly rotating actions to throw out as many stars as possible to end the game. Honestly, the pacing feels very weird to me. It kind of induce an anti-climatic end to the game. I wonder if the different resolutions in the wind gambit expansions would help.

Also for the 3rd game, almost no one bothered with their objectives. I'm contemplating about removing them, or making them public objectives instead (which requires a curated list so that pursuing the objectives but not getting it does not screw up the player's plans.) Maybe having a tighter amount of goals to pursue will force people to interact a little bit more. 

I feel very weirdly about the 4 actions, both the top and bottom ones. I've seen myself trying to cycle through maybe 2-3 of those 4. Also since faction and action boards are randomize, there will come situations where the pairing plays contrary to how the faction will attempt to abuse their powers. The faction abilities are all pretty interesting, and they will make players want to do certain actions more. But sometimes those actions may not be cost effective, and players have to do quite the opposite from their faction to play properly.

Still not so sure of the longevity of the game.

Interesting game. First, it looks gorgeous (a friend of mine has the KS copy): the map, the artwork, the feel, the thematics, the various components all beautifully done.
Second, it has interesting decisions which don't bury you under loads and loads of options but keep things nice and tidy.
Third, it has this interaction as it is a struggle for resources and you will be looking at the progress of your competitors.

However, I felt a disconnect between the planning and the execution (battling it out with mechs). This game is not about battling, it is about scheming your euro engine in a battle-like setting. So in the end, it is multiplayer solitaire more than I like for a game with such a map and cool components. I want to DO stuff with them, not just gaze at the best way to get my next star. So to win, you are forced to make the decision: will I have fun with stompin' mechs or will I have fun by NOT doing that and winning the game instead. As a player who wants to win the game by having fun with stompin' mechs I feel kinda left alone by that choice that is forced upon you.

As a result, would not mind play it again, as it is always entertaining and a great way to spend your evening, but will not be suggested as a first option by me.

An area domination game played with asymmetrical factions. While it's fascinating and tactical, with several different ways to win, the scoring is (intentionally) hard to read. It's a game where you can blaze to 6 stars, seemingly do everything right, and still end up in last place. It takes several playthroughs to figure out what "winning" looks like in this game.

The movement rules can be annoying, since every faction has a different way of crossing water. But all in all, it's a solid and deep game.

This game is so good. It's basic is engine building and resource management but there is so much more. All components are nice and the cards are awesome. The theme of this game might be the best I have ever played. I played the game about 8 times now and it doesn't get boring. I do miss an interaction element in the game which is there in battling, but this is such a minor part of the game. I did win the game a few times without battling. You could see that as a positive but since the game is already focussed on engine building/resource management this is a serieus con for me. Al the other parts of the game like the top and bottom row action, the popularity and the different ways you can earn points are just great and the game in total is outstanding.

Worker placement/movement, resource collection, battles, increase popularity by avoiding battles - this game has it all! There are different ways to win and each faction has their own special abilities which favor different strategies. Beautiful artwork and nice pieces. Interesting theme as well. Slightly heavy rules and setup takes a bit of time.

Automa deck is a nice addition which allows a single player to play against an "AI" of sorts.

tl;dr: worth the hype? Maybe...

Man, this game has quite the hype going on. It appears this is the best thing since sliced bread. It's already ranked #6 on the BGG ranking list of best games of ALL TIME! Why? Don't ask me, I don't know. I like it. I like it quite a bit. But the 6th best game ever? Not for me.
Anyway...
This is an engine building, resource management game with an optional combat element. The main mechanism is the action selection system where you have to select an action space that has a primary and a secondary action that can be executed independently from each other. On top of that, each race has a small special ability that does drive strategy in a certain direction (in some cases more than others).
The game ends as soon as someone gets 6 stars. Stars are like goals that you can achieve, like building all 4 buildings. But the aim is not to have the most stars, no, you want to have the most money. I found it interesting that I was able to win a game (by a very narrow margin) in which I had exactly 0 stars (though I was one action away on 4 stars).
I have now played the game 3 times. Once with each of 2-3-4 players. The game certainly is best with 4, and least interesting with 2. With 3 it is certainly worth playing as well.
I have enjoyed each play quite a bit. This certainly is a very solid design. There are lots of games that do elements from this game better, but very few that combine all of these elements is a package put together well as this game does it.
So I do like this game quite a bit, but is it worth all the hype? Meh, maybe, but I'm not sure it's worth as much hype as this is getting.

I struggled with this one.  I felt like I was very inefficient in the sequence of my actions which slowed my progress.  The game shifted more quickly than I expected to expansion.

Kickstarted. ETA July 2016. Collector's edition, with bigger hexes > bigger board. Because let's be honest: size matters :-)
This is a great game. It has a lot going on: area control, variable player powers, engine building. I painted the minis, makes it even more amazing on the board. The first few rounds can feel like there's not much going on, but then all of a sudden stars are being put on the board and before you know it someone places their 6th star and the game ends, leaving other players  mumbling "aaaahhh, just one more turn!!"

A solid game everyone should play, but I think it's a little over-praised. Some games are very cutthroat and a good laugh but other times it can boil down to 5 people playing their own solo game. The game also feels like there an optimal route to take to win every time (although we haven't cracked it)

Factions are varied enough to keep them fresh each time you play but similar enough so as to not be unbalanced. The game is beautifully crafted and the pieces, card art and coins are all fantastic. I'll never turn down an opportunity to play.

Only one play, but I enjoyed it.  It took a while to learn, but once you do go through everything the turns are really straightforward.  It's weird how all the boards are different and get mixed/matched with each game, so it makes it sort of puzzly in what you get and what you can do each game.  Not sure if it makes a huge difference in the end or not.  I wasn't blown away, but the game was pleasant enough though it was slightly long, maybe that speeds up with more play.  I'm interested in exploring this further.

overhyped and a bit overrated
theme is great, but a bit depressing
attempt of a fusion of American battle game and eurogame
gameplay looks a bit boring: "mechs on hexagons"


in short:
+ theme and artworks
+ some really nice ideas (achieve 6 of several different goals, popularity value, resources on board, different action boards, top and bottom actions, upgrades, encounter cards with choices, ...)
+ asymmetric player powers (factions + action boards) (!)
+ combat mechanic similar to "Dune"/"Rex" (wheel+card)
- "mechs on hexagons"
- fixed board with predefined positions for factions (feels wrong for this kind of game)
- game balance issues (start positions, bashing the weak, ...) ?
- very expensive
- not all factions included

This is a very nice looking game that is engaging, though not immersive, and clearly presented (other than the somewhat abstruse solitary/Automa booklet, which is far better conceived than explained).
Overall, Scythe is largely geared towards point gathering via private achievements (ie. resource gathering) that limit how much I am going to enjoy it. Unlike the modifier tallying of my favorite solitary game (Mage Knight), the combat here in Scythe is perhaps too simple, though clearly fighting is not the focal point. In none of my favorite games am I focused on points/achievements more than story, adventure, conflict, atmosphere, and characters, and what keeps Scythe from being Cave Evil or Mage Knight or Space Alert or Robo Rally is that I see numbers and score cards more than any imaginary world . Still, I enjoyed this solid game enough to play it twice in a row, and it's nice to manipulate the game pieces and to look at. Also, those player cards with the embedded slots for pieces/meeples are superb.

This is a euro game with outstanding box art.  The rules are pretty complicated, and the manual left something to be desired.   As a barbaric american, I would always rather the rules have text instead of only pictures.

I wanted a bit more humor akin to Euphoria.   We had fun playing, but really complicated euro games like this probably aren't right for my particular gaming group.   It felt like the best part of the game was our attempts to add a narrative and some grim/dark humor to it.

So got my shiny new copy this weekend.  I was a bit worried about the hype factor.  A lot of games have a lot of hype to them and then you play them and they just don't live up tot he hype.  Scythe was one of those games that had been talked about for so long and almost universally well reviewed, that the hype factor was off the charts.  I approached it hopeful, but with a sense of trepidation.  I was worried about the level of confrontation being too little, or too much. I was worried about a number of factors.  If it was too complex I knew I could rarely get it to the table with most of my friends and if it was not complex enough I would be bored quickly.

I was happy that my worried were almost all proved to be unfounded.  The game was complex, but intuitive.  You could feel the way the mechanics worked together to make your unique play style.  Every action felt fairly impactful, and I almost had that old school RPG feel in how as I played my choices got better and more powerful by the previous choices I had made.  The play was fairly quick too.  While I could easily see someone having a bout of AP, often you are planning your turns out while you are on the current one and while others are taking theirs.  It made for fluid play.  Very pleased and can't wait to play this a lot more.

For anyone curious, I played this with three people.  Though I could see it being good with a variety of player counts.  Each player added will increase time of the game some.  I think for our first play we were just over an hour and a half time.  Two of us had watch the how to play video and explained the game to our third.

Played one real game and three vs AI thus far. Scythe feels engaging and definitely has a good engine-building chunk to puzzle out, but I don't know that I would call it exciting. I'll have to get more games against real opponents to figure it out. The AI is well-designed though, and the fact that I'm still having issues beating it on the easiest difficulty indicates that there's a lot more for me to learn about efficiency in this game.

Scythe also seems to appeal to a pretty wide crowd -- it has strategic complexity without having excessive mechanical weirdness, and it looks good too.

Edit 9/30/16- This has dropped again...it's a good game, but I'm just not in the mood to play it very much, when there are some amazing games I own...this may change the expansion arrives.

Edit 8/18/16- This has dropped a bit for me, it's still a great game, I just feel that there are some deficiencies, which don't really become apparent until lots of plays.  Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful game, and is well designed, it just isn't innovative and becomes a bit stale.  I still want to play it when I can and I think (hope) the planned expansion will help with some new mechanics.

(first post)I found the play of the game engaging, fun, and thoughtful.  Yes, I don't believe this is a 4x game, and direct conflict is low, but you do have to make decisions based upon your asymmetric starting position/resources. The setup, I believe, really allows a lot of plays. The production is top notch, on par with Stonemaiers other stuff.  This may or may not go up or down with more plays, but after playing it a Con (my copy was delivered as I was driving down to Orlando), I am really looking forward to getting this played with my core group and seeing how they feel about it.

The world of the game plagiarized Dust tactics! Cavalry was ridiculous in front of tanks in the 20s, in front of walkers it is even more of a laughing stock.

Artworks are the best part of this project, but even they lack details so badly.

I get more and more impressed with this game each time I play it. Each faction really feels different from the others. I believe the factions are balanced for the most part but I also think some factions have an advantage based on the player count and based on which player board you get. At its heart this is an efficiency game, you are racing to accumulate victory stars. However, you also need to be reactive and opportunistic with regard to your opponents. Always look for ways to get an easy combat victory star or force your opponent to waste a turn. This is a great game which provides a new challenge with each play.

Scythe is a solidly built game, and I'm not just talking about its components (especially if you have the deluxe Kickstarter version). The mechanics all fit together smoothly such that you always feel as though the designer and developers have done their jobs, and done them well. You feel like they are taking care of you while you play, whispering soft assurances into your ear: "Don't worry, we've thought of everything." I recommend the game, and I want to play it more.

That said, I have to admit, Scythe hasn't yet managed to capture my imagination -- hasn't managed to charm me -- and that is something I look for when I try out new board games nowadays. With so many games on the market, with so many designers mixing and matching mechanics from a variety of other designs, putting together a game that makes me sit up and say "Wow!" is increasingly important. Scythe is rock solid, it really is, but it's also a remix that, for me, hasn't quite connected (but is ever so close).

The comparisons are multitude. In its Euro-influenced engine building aspects, Scythe resembles Terra Mystica. In its 4x exploitation and extermination elements, it resembles any number of games. I'll choose Eclipse because Eclipse is another game celebrated for combining Euro systems with AT themes (I think you could also choose something like Sid Meier's Civilization). In its clever upgrade system, where you remove cubes from your player board to reveal discounts and better special powers, Scythe even resembles, of all things, Hansa Teutonica (weird, I know, but the parallels are there). Finally, in its action selection mechanic, Scythe resembles a rondel game. For me, the strongest comparison isn't Terra Mystica or Eclipse, but instead another game often labeled as 4x-lite: Antike.

But let's put all that aside for a minute and talk about what the game is trying to accomplish and how it gets there. I'm not going to detail specific mechanics. That would be a waste of your time when there are so many great video overviews. Instead, let's talk big picture. Scythe is yet another entry in the 4x-lite category with a heavy dose of Euro influence. It's a space well explored, but also immensely popular. To me, there are two factors to consider if you want to know if Scythe is the game for you.

First, how do you win? In many civ-games, wiping your enemy off the map is a good way to win, as is collecting "achievements" in various areas of technology and culture. Scythe is a bit of a hybrid. The object isn't so simple as killing your enemies or advancing up a tech tree. Like most things in the game, everything is interconnected. In one sense, the object is to score achievements, which could be anything from winning a battle to completing all of your "upgrades." For each achievement you place a star at the top of the board (just like in pre-school; gold star for Tim!). When one player has placed all of his or her stars on the board, the game ends immediately. But! Stars are not victory points. So let's clarify how you actually win...

Achievements give you the sense that the game is all about variety. However, there is a sneaking truth in Scythe that takes all that variety and condenses it into one overriding statistic. Like the Hunger Games, everything ultimately comes down to the popularity contest. Stars alone won't be enough to win because what you really need are points. To get points, you need popularity. Popularity is the master point multiplier, and therefore the most important thing you can earn. Want to know how many points all those stars you earned are worth? -- multiply the number times your popularity level. Want to know how many points your territories are worth? -- multiply the number times your popularity level. Want to know how many points... you get the idea. For a game that presents the players with so many options, the focus on popularity is oddly monochromatic. It doesn't wipe away variety, but it does ensure that everyone will be competing equally in at least one area they cannot afford to ignore.

The second thing worth considering is combat. If you are looking for a combat heavy 4x game, Scythe is not for you. Combat in any civ-lite or 4x-lite game is probably going to happen. How the game handles such a potentially devastating effect can, in my experience, determine whether I love or hate a game. A game like Eclipse, for example, leans heavily in the direction of combat, with fighting and fighting technology comprising a significant portion of play. On the other hand, Terra Mystica doesn't include combat at all, preferring to handle conflict indirectly through the aggressive claiming of territory. Scythe occupies the middle ground, but leans towards the Terra Mystica side of the equation. The game's focus is on engine building, but combat is just enough of a threat to make you worry. The battles are not so devastating to take anyone out of game, especially with a little bit of experience. In fact, you don't ever lose troops. They are instead merely sent back to your home base. That's not to say that losing a combat is no big deal -- it is! -- but it's something from which you can legitimately recover.

Personally, I like the balance that Scythe strikes between fighting and building. At times, it leans a little too heavily towards building, such that I start to worry that any fighting would upset my plans and feel out of place in the game. But that's a matter of misguided perception and overly timid players because combat certainly has its strategic place in the game. There is no other way to prevent someone from grabbing key locations on the board (especially the central factory). There are battles worth fighting, and without combat the game would veer dramatically into multi-player solitaire void of any asymmetrical challenge or overall tension. That said, as with any multi-player game with combat, beware of kingmaker situations. Group-think can easily turn the experience into a slugfest with one player beat down for no other reason than the other players felt like picking on him. Higher player counts alleviate this problem because, of course, too much combat by a few players opens up opportunities for the others (and you can only earn achievement stars for your first two combat victories). Still, it's worth mentioning the potential for abuse, which Scythe does nothing innovative to address.

Scythe isn't a clone of any of the games I've mentioned, but rather a mash-up of all them and more. There isn't anything wrong with a mash-up, especially if it's done well -- and Scythe is done well. But then why can't I get on board the Scythe train? I think the answer is actually quite simple. Scythe is so well put together, so well developed, so well polished, that... well... it's just too darn clean! Too symmetrical, too well-balanced, too clever, too well produced and packaged.

I know! I've lost my frickin' mind. But I want a game with some rough edges here and there. I want a game that doesn't have a perfectly symmetrical board with an even distribution of resources. Sure, players have special powers that make each side feel a little bit different from the others (and that helps!), but is it all just window dressing on top of an identical core? I think it might be.

Perhaps additional plays will help. For now, after a three-player and a five-player game, Scythe impresses, but also fizzles. I can't help but feel that I'm playing a well put together package of a game. On the other hand, I can't help but feel that I'm playing yet another 4x-lite game, remixed in a different way. So it fits comfortably in the same space occupied by many other games. The real decision you have to make is whether Scythe gets the mix right. Do you like the way it balances achievements against victory points? Do you feel it has just the right amount of combat? Like your favorite meal, you know what to expect. You just want to know if the cook put all the ingredients together in the proper way. It's personal taste at that point, and for me Scythe is just a little too safe, a little too mild. But that doesn't mean it isn't damn good eats.

At first Scythe may seem deceiving, even clunky, as you try to figure out what it requires of you. Right down the line of the Ameritrash/Euro union, the combat has a 'cold war' type feel to it, as you build your engine and collect resource while trying to protect yourself from ever present danger. But nothing may ever come of that danger, or it may. 

I love the engine building, I love the tense, pivotal combat, the artwork is sensational, the variable player powers are interesting (though some seem stronger than others). Even the opening moves feel important and tense, yet turns are quick. I love the race to the middle, but the hesitation as well; should I get too close to that other player? Should I sit back and wait or rush in first?

The combat cards could have been a bit more interesting perhaps, with text based abilities, but as combat as rare this isn't essential. The fact that combat only occurs at certain points in the game makes those combat events feel all the more tense; they can essentially turn the tide of the game. 

The different paths to victory are also great to play around with, and make every game fresh and unique. I still feel like I am discovering more about this game every time I play it. I love it equally with two players or more, essentially any player count, while being a very different experience. At this stage I'm not a big fan of the solo play, but I will revisit it on harder difficulties.

*scoring system is interesting; I like the value of "coins" in-game vs. as victory points

*the flavor text seems a little forced and somewhat unnecessary

I'm done with this game. Victory conditions are too random. You can develop everything and max out popularity but if someone attacks you and sends your units home just before someone drops the 6th star, you still lose the game. The game can't decide if it wants to be a development game or an area control game. Tried different strategies and always came out last.

RATING: 8
I'm all sorts of conflicted about this one. I love most of what is going on. Turns are quick and choices are difficult. It's clearly an efficiency game, but I actually think there are many paths to take in your quest for efficiency. I love that combat is a piece of the game, but not the main goal, and that defeat doesn't necessarily mean disaster. So what's not to like? Well, players going first have a clear advantage, whether it manifests as reaching the factor or encounters first or at the end of the game, where those going first may get a critical extra turn. This is a huge deal, especially since in games with 4+ players, in my experience, the starting player is the one to reach six stars, finish the game and get the win a disproportionate number of times. I'm not sure what the solution is yet, but the end game/early player advantage issue does need to be addressed. That said, from the beautiful components to the variety of combination the player boards offer to the tough choices faced by players, I like Scythe enough that I want to somehow solve its end game issues and keep playing.

I was afraid that many players will be disappointed with this game because they will expect a different gaming experience. On the other hand I knew exactly what this game is about and I love every piece of it! Setting and illustrations are superb and the gameplay fits perfectly to my taste. 

Strategy game where you want to get the best out of every action and decision, where you have to think carefully about timing and still watch others, different play style of every faction and map that enables you to engage everyone from early phases of the game (if you wish to and it's beneficial to you). 

I can't recommend this game enough to everyone who likes strategy games! :-)

After one play: Nice engine building with a bit of conquest. The last few turns seem to be a spreadsheet nightmare, though: How can I end the game, who could end the game when, which action scores me most points considering the estimated remaining turns, who has how many points and where could I take an area from the leader,..? Perhaps more experienced players are able to anticipate all these things, so the amount of planning is a bit more evenly distributed?

Gorgeous looking game, no doubt.  The aesthetics and setting were really the main thing that got me interested in the Kickstarter campaign in the first place.  

The game itself, though, feels less inspired, at least at the 2 or 3 player counts.  The process and structure of playing the game never slides into the background to let the lush theme shine through, which is disappointing.

I'm also not a fan of a few of the design choices; in particular, receiving ongoing benefits after doing an Enlist action whenever your neighbours conduct the same action going forward... thematically nonsensical and is mostly just annoying to keep track of.

Update: I do prefer the game with 5 players and have increased my rating accordingly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a good game. It's just that some faction abilities are better or worse with a different player count whereas other abilities outright rock. The ability of Rusviet Union to always be able to use the same section comes in handy all the time whereas for example the Polish ability is awesome in a 2-player game but pretty much blows in a 5-player game.
Despite all its chrome, namely the fantastic artwork, the magnificent design of coins and resources, the awesome minis, Scythe is not an immersive experience in my book. Encounters are advantage a) through c). I'd say, Nevertheless, those components are divine (speaking of the metal coins and realistic resource tokens). Scythe works so well, because the theme doesn't thrust itself heavily on the player, so that turns can run along smoothly even at a player-count of 5.

If as someone who hasn't tried it, it seems like praise for it is everywhere, just know it's warranted. Scythe is just an intensely fun strategy game with almost endless replay factor, only amped further by its Invaders expansion. The price tag is high, but hard to argue with the lovely art and high quality contents. Fun with any number of players including solo, open to any sort of strategy... War, explore, develop, rarely will a leader/faction combo lock you into an unwanted play style. play moves quick with veterans, and slow but not agonizingly so with rookies. Only real compliant is time investment... Setup and tear down are lengthy, so schedule time enough for it... Maybe to get a few sessions in at once for efficiency's sake.

Initial impression: exquisite.  Gorgeous production, fascinating gameplay, rock-solid rulebook.  Worth every penny.  An easy rating of nine after a few plays, with potential to get higher than that.

Lasting impression:  Love it.  One of the absolute centerpieces of my collection.  Great fun at any player count and lots of incentives to pursue different strategies each time.  And I doubt I'll ever own another game that looks as good as this one does.

Only one play so far.  2 players seemed like a very empty map.  No conflict was needed, so spending time building up combat cards, etc seemed like a waste.  Also, Enlisting near the midpoint of the game did not seem to pay off, since it only activates with one other player, and they already had their buildings almost built, etc. I think this game will play much better with 4.  I dont know if I'll play with 2 again.

I was initially more positive on the game but after several more plays the issues really start to come out. I will admit that the over-the-top production helps the game tremendously.

The first few rounds are mostly automatic, some faction pairings can be overpowered, the battle system has some issues (the blind bidding doesn't work very well, and losing a battle can open up the victor to then be attacked before recovering) and the race element means that players earlier in turn order will get more turns overall.

I could give more details on each thing but most importantly my group just liked the game less and less each time we played.

It has a lot of rules and nuances, but once everyone is familiar, gameplay is fast and smooth.

RATING: 9.5
The game came out with a lot of hype which had me interested in the first place. The artwork was captivating but when I saw the components it seemed like a 3-4 hr game which wasn't my type of game.

However, after purchasing it and having played through it the first time, I found it was rather easy to learn and teach. The turn order was simple: pay/do the top row action and if you can, do the bottom row action; next player. This simple mechanic keeps the turns short and reduces AP. 

Additionally, its classified as a 4X game but you can play it without engaging combat at all. Some players don't like conflict which is a good alternative so they can do their own thing.

An euro game with area control, resource management, gorgeous art, and high replayability hits all my sweet spot. Definitely recommend it and I can't wait for future expansions!

RATING: 6
Of a similar lineage to Archipelago; less of a sandbox but more obvious how to play.  Enjoying it less the more I play it. Opening moves are rather scripted as, although the mix of player boards creates a slightly different script, it is nevertheless a script if you want to be anything approaching efficient.  As the game plays out, it ends up being unmemorable because everyone has everything in play so every play ends up looking and feeling exactly the same as the last.  The random combination of faction, action board and objectives can even create a "losing hand" situation from the start which is a significant flaw in a game of this length. Overall, not a bad game, but certainly not great. A triumph of marketing style over design substance.

This is a superb, light-to-medium weight 4X game. Doubt I'll ever tire of it. It's gorgeous, well made, thematically resonant, well balanced, intricate and yet it only takes about 30 minutes to teach. For its elegance and relative mechanical simplicity, its surprisingly deep on strategic and tactical value (and with the right crowd, pretty engaging for player interaction as well). After finally getting a copy a couple weeks ago (a full year+ after its post-KS delivery) I've already clocked 10 plays, 5 of which were solitaire games using the astounding Automa developed solo variant. I could write 1000 words on just how good the solo variant is and still have more praise yet to be written. 10/10 and after just 10 plays its easily on my top 20 All Time list. Unbelievably great work Jamey S.!!!!

July 2016. My first real Kickstarter! I was concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype, but I'm happy to report that it met and exceeded my expectations. This is one of my favorite games right now. I look forward to playing it many more times over the years. July 2016

Returned rating to a 10. I've played 6 solo games, which is pushing it back up for me. I don't usually care about solo gaming that much, but with my limited time lately, it's nice to be able to knock out a game in the evening in about 90 minutes including setup and breakdown. August, 2016.

I'm still in love with this game. I haven't been able to play for over a month, but still have TWENTY NINE plays so far this year (that's just from late July through late October!). Solo mode has been great. I've also been solo-testing a campaign I've designed, playing 4-player games by myself. I've gotten a ton of use out of this, and I truly regret not going all-in on the Kickstarter. I've ordered the metal coins, and maybe someday I'll get the realistic resources. I love this game so much. December 4, 2016

A HUUUUUUUUUGE 4x style game with incredibly easy rules and the most gorgeous art and theme.

Don't be fooled this is a super smooth Euro game, with some fighting elements thrown in, not the other way around.

That said the mechanics and pace of turns are rock solid, there's a lot to like about the game, it has some good well implemented ideas like the upgrade system.

There's unique factions, the bits amazing (just ridiculous quality), the game runs smooth and is easy to teach.  The scoring has some pretty unique and innovative ideas behind it.

Very very solid euro game with a higher than normal level of player interaction, but even losing fights is NOT a big deal.

Just don't buy it if you are hoping it is going to be a big mech battle game, it is not.

While the game is surprisingly easy to pick up and play, it does have quite a steep learning curve in order to figure out each faction's strategies/strength.

Production quality is top-noch, and the price is not that high.

I came in with lukewarm expectations about Scythe. The universal fawning has become a bit nauseating and the SUSD crew wasn't blown away. I left with a positive impression of the game, however.

The rules were hefty but once the game began it moved at a steady clip, even at five players. The ability to "double dip" on an action if you properly planned your turn has a Concordia-esque feel to it and leads to a really fun, crunchy puzzle.

The reputation track and combat are both interesting and well implemented. The absurd nature of the randomized starting factions has been touted as a drawback, but it surely will lead to a ton of replayability.

My only reservation is that the game felt an awful lot like Terra Mystica, an all-time great game that I don't get to the table often enough. Is Scythe different enough to take game sessions away from TM? Is there room enough for both to exist?

So far one of my favorite solo experiences I have had. Once I got into the groove of the Automata (which, I will say took some work) the game moved quick and was a blast. I do need to go through and make sure some of the rules were right, seeing as I messed up at the beginning on river-walking and tunnels, but didn't feel like restarting the game. I also want to show my friends this game without a doubt, even if the complexity is a bit higher up there.Def a great game and worth the wait and purchase.

Scythe is a phenomenal blend of engine building and area control, spiced up by a little bit of wargaming and with a theme that is both special and very well presented.

Drawing nation/board combinations randomly can result in very imbalanced games though as there clearly are better and worse combinations. On the other hand you can mitigate differences in experience and ability by giving better players worse combinations.

Scythe combines beautiful art, a wonderfully quirky theme and solid mechanisms into one promising game. I expect to play this solo, with my girlfriend (casual gamer) and my friends ("hardcore" gamers), whenever I can.

The Kickstarter campaign was one of the best I've seen to date, with the creator and artist actively discussing their decisions and even accepting feedback without getting upset.

As a bonus, the realistic resources and the metal coins in the higher-tier versions can be used with other games. I think the creator even offers a list of possible uses for the resource tokens.

I'm 100% sure I'll get the expansion to Scythe as well - just waiting for the information on when, where and how my money needs to be given to Stonemeier Games. ;)

Oh what's that? Another grand scale 4X (kinda more like 3X here) game. I can feel my wallet lightening already. Scythe is just so good. It reminds me of Eclipse mixed with Terra Mystica. Which are both fantastic games in their own right. This is definitely less combat oriented than eclipse, but the economic engine is really interesting here. Removing the tokens to reveal their effect underneath. It just all works really well. Also, the kickstarter edition is beautiful. And the theme? Alternate timeline post-apocalypse Europe, where people ride yaks. Sign me up, I love yaks. I just cant keep away from the dudes on a map 4X type games. I guess I should just give in...

If you have the deluxe version, the artistic value is exceptional. The game is simple (but it will take some time to go through the rules). It has self-explained mechanisms due to the clever player-board design. The game itself is fast (about 3 hours for 5 people), and has mechanisms build in to advance the game end even if some players will try to extend the game-play. It is one of these games that you need at least 1 play to get the rhythm, so you can play well. It is more an economic game with some fighting (although there are strategies to become a fighting game with a lot of economic thinking). It well worth to be in your collection.

Kickstarter deluxe copy with metal coins and physcial resource markers.

I'm really enjoying this, have played 2 and 3 player games so far.  The art style is beautiful and I like the overall combination of elements.

The random player mat that gets distributed with the factions gives huge replay to this game, avoids the whole "here's the strategy to win with this team" issue that invariably finds its way into games.

The early sprint to the factory seems somewhat unbalanced.  If you get a hero in quickly, the factory feels like it could be a major runaway-leader issue, although I haven't played enough to say one way or the other.

The game borrows mechanics from several classics, including Doom's combat wheel and combat card system (which works very well here.)  I like how the designer's intent of "the threat of combat" being more persistent than actual combat seems to have been executed successfully.

About [thing=169786][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
Is an optimization euro with asymmetric positions, costs and abilities and with some sprinkled combat, area control, random encounters and a tad of a race game. There were (and likely still are) plenty of arguments around the fact the designer said that [thing=169786][/thing] is a 4X game. I didn't see it. I wouldn't called it that way to others. But if one wants, hey, be my guess.

[thing=169786][/thing] has a light amount of interaction, mostly for board position. Yet, for the most part, you will do your thing, the others will do theirs, and rarely one will care to see what you are doing. It will be more an affair of "pass me 3 food", or "raise my popularity by 1", or "I'm building this, here". 

There is a high amount of decisions points offered by the game, and several paths to follow, though the nation and action board taken do narrow the possibilities, since the game rewards optimization, it pays better to make actions more suited to your advantages.

The game bits are great and the art on the card and player boards are, as expected, amazing. The kickstarter version comes with some awesome metal coins and special resource tokens.

Playing time, though not really short, sits comfortably in a game night, lasting around 2 hours, even with 5 players. Downtime increases the more players at the table, but isn't a big issue, as the actions are limited and executed quickly, most of the time (combat is also done fast).

The theme, while a big initial draw to many, due to Jakub's art, passes under the radar almost all the time during play. Rarely did we make a thematic connection between an action in game to what nation we were. The encounters have some nice tidbits of theme and worldbuilding, but we simply passed above many, as the next player was already carrying out his action, yet, eventually we heard a "So, I stopped to let the geese cross the road..." - seems proper.

Overall, the [thing=169786][/thing] works smoothly and well enough, even if it brings little actual theme and mechanical innovations to the table.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player is represented by a nation, with special abilities, correlations and unique costs for building stuff. The goal of the game is to have more money at the end. Stars, areas controlled and resources are worth money at the end of the game - these are multiplied by the popularity the player has. Also, players gain money when doing things (building, encounters, etc) during the play, but some actions also cost money to be done.

The simple way to say what happens during the game is: each turn the player picks an area of her own player board to activate a main action, which are: move, trade, bolster and produce. Then, if able, the player can activate the secondary action associated with the main action (these change between the player boards, and are part of the asymmetry) - these always cost resources to be done, and isn't always possible to be made due to this, specially near the start of the game.

The tricky part is: once an (action) area of the board is activated, it can't be done again in the next turn - a different area must be used.

Mechas and heroes can initiate combat, and is done by, secretly, each player deciding the amount of power to use (adjusting a dial), to a maximum of 7, and if add a combat card (whose power varies from 2 to 5). The highest amount of power wins, and in case of a tie, the attacker wins. Defeated mechas, hero and workers return the the player starting position. Buildings, even from the defeated player, remain. For each worker sent away, the winner loses 1 popularity. All used power (in the dial) is lost, regardless of the result. Resources in the area in which the combat occurred are in possession of the winner.

There are 10 ways of getting stars - winning combat (x2), building all mechas, doing all upgrades, making all buildings, reaching the max popularity or max power, and others. Once a player reaches 6 starts, the game is over, and final scoring will happen. The player with the most money will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Several. What action to do each turn - and this is two fold, as every action on the board is divided in two - and, sometimes, you will truly want to make the action above, but won't be able to make the bellow, and in a optimization game, this is usually not a good thing. Therefore, it might be worth more to delay the coveted action for a turn or two, to make the best of it, as once used, the action can't be done (usually) again in the next turn.

And all actions also have connected decisions: where to move, what resources to take, which option to pick from an encounter, what to build and where (from proper buildings, to mechs, as each uncover a special ability, to upgrades and enlists), and many others. If a battle starts, there is considerations about the amount of power to use and if/which combat card to add.

Overall, there is plenty points of decisions - most not all that difficult, to the point to induce to some severe analisis paralisis, but enough to make each matter and have lasting effects in the board state and in your game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Excellent components;
- Several options to choose from in each turn;
- Clear objectives that all players can go after;
- Asymmetric, as all nations have unique abilities and different costs for actions;
- Downtime is rather small;
- Combat causes little damage for the player that loses, and there is basically no player elimination;
- Little luck, kept in the draw of combat and encounter cards.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Small interaction and even interest in what the other players are doing for most of the time;
- The art on the board can get in the way of seeing the situation of the play;
- A collage of mechanisms (from Kemet, Dune, Antike, euros of optimization, etc) in a whole that, while it works well enough, has little innovation;
- The theme is, sadly, lost during play.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
"So, popularity rises the amount of money you will get."
"Like [thing=24181][/thing]?"
"Yes, mostly, but just for you. 
"The board is big, as you can see, but every place is kind of near to each other, once Mines are made."
"Reminds me what happens in [thing=127023][/thing]."
"Close. There can be the same pressure and the thought that no place is truly completely safe. Anyway, in the battle you bid an amount of power and may or not add a card to boost the total."
"Ah, like [thing=121][/thing]?"
"But with phantom units - you don't handle armies, just a level of power. And without f***** traitor generals." (A sore spot.)
"The goal is to have the most money in the end. Yes, like [thing=24181][/thing], things in the board help, but money in the pocket is what counts. The game ends when someone reaches 6 stars, and stars you get when you do one of 10 objectives."
"Sort like the objectives in [thing=166857][/thing]."
"Hum, sure, sort of. There isn't such a race here, as is only the trigger to end, not the end goal itself."

(...) And a whole lot of this. It feels like playing parts of several top notch games, not all taken to the fullest, some being more waterdown, but I could still find connections: like trying to make the best of the main and secondary action and not being able to use them again for a time remind me of [thing=59294][/thing] (and also having heroes exploring the map); the resources on the board that can be taken and/or used by others, some economic and pick and deliver games; and so on.

At first the game seemed daunting, with so many options and branching paths to acquire money, resources, popularity, power, etc. But once we started playing, things fell nicely into place, and though there is a fine level of possibilities, each one is clearly defined, contained in a simple action to be carried on, to the point that even a friend of mine, who usually struggle to understand quickly the mechanics of a game, did learn the ways of [thing=169786][/thing] rather fast.

I can understand the hype around it, though I don't really share the same amount of love many have, as, for me, [thing=169786][/thing] is a well done game, interesting and smart, taking good parts of other games and making a whole that works nicely together. But not groundbreaking, particularly innovative or inventive, nor has an awesome factor besides the art, which just sits in the background, as does the rest of the theme.

I recommend 2v2 and 2v2v2 (for those who own the expansion) variants very highly because they allow some of the "weaker" factions to really shine and allow the game last much longer than with normal rules (some people in my group don't like the racing aspect in regular game).

My 25th play was my first with a production copy. The gameplay was already top notch, and the fantastic production seals my love for it. More a euro with the ever present threat of war than a true waro. Saving military victories for the endgame is an important strategic consideration. However, you could beat each other to death with this game if your group were into that sort of thing. The heart of the game is in the way its structures interaction between players. The map and tech progression work together to create a watchful but safe early game for getting an engine going. The midgame sees players crossing out of their own territories to rub elbows on the mainland. Then the end game sees players either rushing for safe ground or chaotically clashing in battle to place last stars and expand. I have wanted one game to fill that Euro Trash niche. This is it. And my fancy version is easily the prettiest game I've ever played. Is it the best game? One of them, but not quite "the game." It's going to be my go-to for a lot of guests. But I think Caylus and Agricola are still holding the crowns.

After a half-dozen plays with and without the expansion factions, I find this painfully boring.

The highly constrained puzzle-y opening probably helps it work as a gateway, but I would suggest other games.

I've read that the bot works very well and that the solo game is interesting, and I still look forward to trying that on a friend's copy.

The designer-publisher seems sincere and frankly pretty great, so I'll also keep an eye out for their other work.

Didn't care for this game.  Dull efficiency euro with no positional play.  Solid and streamlined, but lacks any decisions.  Take an action, upgrade, get the stuff, spend the stuff, get more stuff, spend the stuff, build a thing, do a thing.  Quite dull.  Nice art.

The upgrade mechanic feels nice.  Take a cube to make your top action get you more stuff, move that cube to a bottom action to make it cheaper.

RATING: 5
Really not impressed by this one.

First off, the obvious: the artwork is phenomenal. Beautiful and sets the mood wonderfully. I honestly think that whatever Stegmaier paid Rozalski couldn't have been 10% of what he deserved... The artwork drove the hype for the game.

As for the actual gameplay, well that's where it fell pretty flat to me. Action decisions on a given turn are boring and repetitive. The beginning of the game felt tedious as everyone makes tiny moves in their little silo as they begin to get their engine up and running.

But the biggest way in which this game fell flat for me is that the engine-building was severely constrained. You couldn't really specialize in any one area very much. Sure you could upgrade to save a cube here or there but there was no in-depth combos or chaining.

And the ending of the game is entirely anti-climactic. Scoring feels arbitrary. A single spot on the popularity track can lead to a huge swing in final position.

In short, so very disappointing and "meh."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Scythe is an engaging game that centers around an efficiency race to obtain your victory stars faster than anyone else, using the unique powers of your faction, as well as the unique strengths of your action board. As an engine builder with a racing element it resembles a euro game like Terra Mystica, but with more theme/narrative and beautiful artwork. The game's length, around 3 hours with 4 players, and depth/complexity ratio both hit my personal sweet spot. It really is not a hard game to teach, but a tough game to be good at for sure. I cannot say that it has me sitting on the edge of my seat while playing (like Forbidden Stars does), but it keeps everyone at the table involved and entertained the entire(!) time. Consequently, we are all looking forward to our next play! My 10 rating is only for a game with 4 or 5 players - it is probably an 8 with 3, and a 7 with 2 players.

Scythe is an extremely well designed 4x game. The tight design and mechanics make for a rich and streamlined experience.

Components: The game components are excellent quality and leave little to be desired. The plastic models are sturdy and very well detailed. The cards are of thick stock and beautifully illustrated. The player boards are double layered and feel innovative. The map board is also beautifully colored, clear and a lovely sight just to lay out.

Ease of learning/teaching: The game is fairly complex, but for the number of mechanics in the game, it's relatively straightforward to explain and learn. The iconography is intuitive. However, it is not a game for everyone. 

Theme: The faction powers feel strongly thematic. The encounter cards do a beautiful job of picturing scenarios without forcing a narrative through flavor text. The back stories for faction leaders are well described and I found the world immersive. 

Gameplay: The mechanics are streamlined and I appreciate splitting top and bottom row actions which contribute significantly to reducing downtime between turns. I like that there are numerous paths to victory and the key lies in maximizing efficiency in actions while maintaining focus on selected objectives. A good player will outshine the competent player by observing the map and leveraging events across the board. 

The game is also very well suited for solo play with adjustable difficulty settings.

All in all, I greatly enjoy this game and bringing it out. I paid a pretty penny for it but have no remorse. One of the most outstanding strategy games I've seen in a while.

Simply amazing.

Scythe is the pinnacle of Stonemaier Games' productions. Designer Jamey Stegmaier successfully captured the feel of Jakob Rozalski's alternate history world with a territory control game that marries the feel of Kemet and Terra Mystica.

The game is both a treat to play and to see. The title is appropriate for multiple gaming tastes, including area-control, upgrade mechanics, asymmetric powers, and streamlined gameplay.

By far the best Kickstarter project I have backed.

And the automa, despite its initially steep learning curve, is one of the best solitaire euro games ever.

RATING: 5.5
in this game it's about getting the most money. On your turn you can produce ressources, “buy“ force or renown, move your pawns (your chief, mechs or peasants). With the ressources you can build buildings, mechs or advance your options.
With all these actions you can also earn money. 
Fights are a good way to hinder your opponent and steal their ressources. Your chief can moreover have encounters which are like a big bonus where you get things like ressources, reputation, force or money.
For many things like winning a fight, get maximum force or reputation, enhance all options, build all buildings, build all mechs etc you get stars. The first to gather six stars triggers the game end. Then everybody compares what they have and the player with the most money is the winner.

This game has a lot of cool things. The gameplay is very simple once you understand the basics and you have a lot of possibilities to gather stars. 
I could not really enjoy this game however because the downtime is way too high for this game. It is just not interesting to watch the other players' turns. Somehow the gathering of the ressources is not good enough, you have to wait a lot of turns until you can really do the actions that give you stars and money... it all feels a bit mechanic and hindered...
But I can certainly understand why people like it that much, it is very well outthought amd clever and smooth and the factions' abilities are very cool.

To me it is not that good but I will certainly give it another shot

Played on a collecters/premium/whatever edition.  There's a ton of nice physical bits, and a lot of things to try to do, but I'm not sure there's enough to make it incredible.  It stands over some of the other popular euros.  In our two games we didn't get to any sort of "not the best move for me by itself, but since it hoses over player X, it's worth it."  I think there's some of that there given more plays, but I don't think we'll hunt out the plays.  It'll come to us, or not as it wills.

Enjoyable enough experience, but nothing mind-blowing.  Components are solidly above average, so worth looking at if this is important to you.

Randomized board combinations offer variety, but can also set up solidly disadvantaged builds or awful hidden goals (a mechanic I consider very weak in general, though it works *okay* here.)  Combat is also solidly swingy - mindgames are neat and all, but the sheer range of difference possible can effectively give a random win or loss.  (It can also be swingy in terms of who can get targeted by who based on Riverwalk and such, giving an advantage to people not involved in combat at times.)

Player powers, as with many games that have them, feel neat but often heavily force your hand as far as what strategies you can pursue.  Endgame is excessively calculational, and the sudden stop (as well as potential races to factory or encounters) should give some advantage to earlier turn order.  The nonsense bandaid 'punish players for counting score' indicates the developers realized there was a problem here and then... didn't fix it.

The component quality is very high, but this isn't terribly important to my enjoyment of a board game.

Instead it adds Mechs/Combat and Area Control, which are my favorite type of genre.  You'd think that would be great... but I'm not entirely sure.  The end game always feels weak to me.  I tend to love games that are a race, but in this game it almost feels like it's robbing something from the experience.    The game is relatively tight, and it seems like someone just grabbing a really nice territory from someone in a last minute attack seems to swing it in their favor.  

My biggest gripe may be how anti-climactic the battles are, every fight I've seen so far, you know exactly who is going to win.  I think that sucks a lot of the excitement out of what this type of game usually offers me.  Because of that, while I'm always happy to play it, it's not really a game that has grabbed me and begged to be played more.

Tried the PnP version. The game is one of the most beautiful games I've seen but gamewise it offered nothing new or exceptionally good. One of the players compared it to Hyperborea afterwards and I agree, it is very similar although I liked this slightly better. I might consider buying this second hand at 50% off but KS backing is a no go for me.

Beautiful game with some interesting features but overrated in my opinion. 
in terms of gameplay, Terra Mystica is far superior for me.

[+] Components and artwork are stellar, semi-asymetric factions offer great replayability, upgrade & enlist systems are great (build & deploy are more classic)
[-] table space, fixed startup positions, end-scoring-objectives have little impact, some objectives/encounters are way easier/better than others, don't like the combat system, don't like the endgame where you don't want to get 6th star if you are not in the running for best score, point salad at the end

Good, but not great.  I've got lots of games that occupy the same space this one does, with its Euro-inspired mechanics with a dash of faction-specific abilities and a splash of combat.  The art and minis are nice, but the theme leaves me very cold and there's a serious runaway leader problem that can develop.  It's also not particularly friendly for newbies.  They'll get crushed by somebody who knows what they're doing.  That might work for some groups, but it makes it a poor fit for mine.

Played this once at a cafe. There's fun in thinking a couple of turns ahead in order to be as efficient as possible. However, I wasn't overly taken with the experience and it felt a bit flat for me and I think the reason is the lack of constraints on what you can do. 

I prefer a game where you have to puzzle out how you are going to reach a tough goal but this felt too open.

Be warned: Scythe is not your typical wargame, despite what the box art might lead you to believe. With that being said, I definitely enjoyed my first play, and I look forward to playing it again soon. The art is excellent, and I appreciated the gradual yet satisfying process of, for example, moving the technology cubes from the top of my player mat to the bottom, thereby making both rows of actions more efficient.

Decent economic game with some nice mechanisms, really like how resources are kept on the map and can be taken away by other players and the tableau management is reasonably engaging.

Game is ruined by a lack of thought and effort in a few areas. The encounters are just art with 3 options very boring not to have some flavour text, miniatures are pretty bad, which may seem trivial but they are the centrepiece of the game so it does detract.

Biggest issue is the absolutely terrible combat system, basically a resource bidding war where often the winner loses more than the loser or both players end up making themselves vulnerable to further attack, counter intuitive and annoying.

RATING: 7
Scythe is a beautiful, well-designed engine builder that I sold after a couple of plays because it didn't offer the kind of player interaction that I was looking for and in the end struck me as interesting, but hollow. 

There is player action in the game- various mechanisms provide opportunities to interact with the other players (combat, recruits, encounters), I just don't find it enhances the play experience for me as I prefer interaction that more strongly impacts the other players' decisions.

Recruits provide me a reason to stay engaged on other players' turns but really have a minor impact on strategy.

Combat is situationally worth the effort but is so easily disincentivized that it is rarely worth the hassle. The "cold war" threat of combat certainly exists, but is much more exciting in Eclipse, for example, where there is a reaction on multiple levels (pinning strategy, tech tree "cold war") in addition to unit posturing.

After playing Scythe I find myself yearning to play titles where the game is structured so that players need to act and react to the other players' choices to excel (don't get me wrong if you ignore the other players in Scythe you aren't playing well, but if you do it seems you will still bump into more roadblocks to trying to affect their gameplay than opportunities to do so).

In short the player interaction in Scythe isn't fulfilling for me. The interactions I experienced with the other players were neither memorable nor fun. I don't feel like I've done something clever or bested my opponent, rather I feel like I've upgraded another cube to make my mechs cost only 1 metal so that I can keep cranking them out (and what are the other players going to do about it)?

I can certainly see why so many seem to love the game but I guess in the end it really isn't the type of game that I like.

2017 update: After a few plays, including 2 in a tournament format, I'm dropping the rating to 9. I've had some purely BAD games of Scythe. There's a few combos that are so pigeonholed, you lose almost all freedom to play how you'd like. The worst is Saxons with a board that doesn't reward mech building. Other players will almost always have an advantage, and your only hope is that they don't notice you building up for combat before you can attack. 

The rest of the game is great though, and I especially love the new Japanese-style faction. Still among my favorite games, but I've seen enough  failures in it's mechanics to break the 10-rating love I once felt.

I should play again, but it combines elements from other games in a slightly new way. Not sure I'm excited about the theme and that's really necessary to get into this game. The combat is VERY simple and is not a central focus of the game. Of the 4 X's of 4X, this one focuses on the following order: eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, eXterminate.

Overall I really enjoy this game.

Great components, amazing artwork and varied gameplay with tons of replayability. Scythe is easily one of the best board games I've ever played.

It's also a feat of pure genious how a game as complex as Scythe has been made so easy to teach by a very visually helpful board and a game that builds on the mechanics as you play and doesn't force everything on you the second you start taking turns.

There's also a lot to be said about how amazing the visuals look when you think about how clearly and smartly everything is laid out. It's a perfect balance of gorgeous artwork mixed with helpful symbols in just the right places.

The minis and artwork are also oozing with interesting lore. It's a game where every little detail has a surprisingly practical meaning in terms of both worldbuilding and the mechanics.

For me this game lived up to all the hype. I love games where you have several open goals you can go for, and it is sort of a race to complete a number of them the fastest and most efficient. Also I think the combat mechanisms (even though you will not see a whole lot of it, in one game) is very well executed. Add in variable player powers, resource management, a gigantic interesting map and engine building. Very solid and entertaining game to play.

This game (and Lords of Waterdeep) convinced me to take bgg ratings with big bucket of salt. Its not bad - its a good game and I would usually play it, but its nowhere near as it was/is hyped up to be. It is not particularly interesting in terms of mechanics or gameplay (except for few minor innovations). To me it falls under the efficiency engine-building euros category (the 4x aspect is just barely there) but the experiences of playing it is not as satisfying or fun as in other engine builders e.g Caverna. With all the cool components, interesting theme, gorgeous artwork this game seem to have lot of potential but the actual experience of playing it leaves you underwhelmed.  

But as I said its not a bad game. It doesn't take a long for a complex game, has multiple paths to victory, there doest not seem to be any obvious problems with balance - its just that it is not as great as it is hyped up to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
Great blend of existing mechanisms put into a very smooth package. Has a great flow to it for a game with a large feel. Particular virtues are the relatively short playtime for this type of game, the micro turns keeping everyone involved and that it plays well at different player counts.

I expect my rating might change as whilst I don't think worse of it, my enthusiasm has dipped a little now I've played all factions and seen more of the game.

Need to play again to re-evaluate but my opinion of this continues to drop. I think it is the lack of emergent interaction (combined then with the sharply contrasting interaction of combat) and the 'on-the-rails' feel of play.

As 8.8, 120 minute game.

Scythe is really interesting, but what really elevates the experience is Automa deck. Right now my favourite way to play is with one additional faction run by AI. It throws in some much needed unpredictability and variety.

Assuming you have the Kickstarter deluxe version, this is a gorgeous production. I'm happy to say that the gameplay is almost as good. The game is sort of a mix between Terra Mystica and Dune. Like Terra Mystica, the focus of the game is clearing your player board of buildings as efficiently as possible. The Dune side of things is the combat system. it is zero luck, with both sides bidding a number of troops and then adding a card or two to the bid, after which all are lost.

I think the most innovative thing about Scythe is the way it handles heroes and quests. Instead of the usual random card and wall of text, Scythe offers the players a beautiful painting to set the scene and then a couple of options for your hero to react to it. These usually fall along the Paragon/Neutral/Renegade decision tree found in many video games. How you behave determines your scoring opportunities in later rounds, which is a neat idea.

Another thing I like is the resource system. When goods are produced, they sit in their space of origin until a player uses them. This is a genius idea that opens up all sorts of strategies, both offensively and defensively.

My only concern is that it could get samey over multiple games, as there is probably a best path through every player board.

Fave game ever: Mixes area control with some elements of 4X. Basically you get strategy, management and tactics in the same game without the complicated 4x systems (that i also love btw). Game uses easy rules but its deep and complex. Not a beginner game for sure (unless all are on the same level experienced players will absolutely dominate) but with experienced players its the type of game that when you lose will make you think "i totally deserved it". Only flaw is first turns of forced dominant strategy but Wind Gambit expansion totally fixes it. Deserves to become an eternal classic like Puerto Rico.

Great theme of steampunkish 1920's Central Europe overlayed on a mechanical mashup of Euro, Ameritrash, and wargame.  Difficult to digest, but smooth Euro mechanics.  The [thing=121][/thing]-inspired combat fits nicely.  Leaders, mechs, and workers are uniquely detailed for each faction.  Fine detail throughout rewards taking a closer look at the map, the cards, and other components.  The many ways to score points allow for many different strategies.  Variable faction powers coupled with variable starting setup keep everyone from creating the same engine or playing the same game twice.  The map is relatively tight and players are in each others' grill sooner than later.  Shares some traits and feel with real-time simulation computer games.  A great Euro with BOTH theme and conflict!

Spoiler - get oil first. Win.

The more and more I wanted to like the game, the more and more everything about it turned me off: theme, mechanics, miniatures, production, etc. During the KS project I printed out a print and play copy to play & test. Got pieces together and read the rules.

It all fell flat. It's hyped as a 4X game. It's barely 2X and those two parts are half way done.

For me, this is an engine builder for the sake of building that engine. 

Pass.

One of the best games I've played in a while. So many possible ways to develop your strategy, yet not overly complex to understand (our 11 year old plays regularly). This is not a war game, and while combat is certainly part of it, I enjoyed the price one pays for pursuing that path. Great artwork and theme. Play time definitely closer to 2 hours, even with 2 players. The asymmetrical and randomized player / faction boards are another great element. Have yet to acquire the expansion.

[i]Preliminary rating after one 2p game:[/i]

Scythe has some interesting and clever mechanics, but overall I was rather underwhelmed by this game. There's a lot going on here, but ultimately nothing is too exciting. It's one of these games in which you have to put a lot of effort to do anything, but the "fun factor" you get in return is pretty low. I know that it probably gets more interesting with more players, but it's not the "dudes on the map" part of the game that falls flat to me - it's the whole action selection system and the process of developing your own player board, it just feels tedious.

Also, the illustrations on the cards are beautiful, but you hardly ever get to look at them during the game.

Extremely well stream-lined Euro game with head-to-head conflicts. It suffers from the balance problem like all asymmetric and low-randomness games do (e.g. Terra Mystica). I haven't played this game enough yet to comment on the balance, but it seems clear that Red and Yellow are more versatile and stronger than the rest given any player count.

I have some concerns about designer's comment on balance: "When we made Rusviet's unique ability cost 1 power, it was used 0 times". I am not saying it is definitely worth 1 power per usage, but it implies they didn't push their playtesters far enough. Veteran players seem to come up with balance solutions, and the meta is still actively evolving, so I'll keep following the forum.

One of my favorite games! It just hits all the right buttons: medium-weight Euro that is relatively easy-to-teach and has extremely gorgeous artwork and world-building.  Plus, there's so many different strategies with the unique factions and boards that it's always fun to try out different strategies.

Choo-choo, time to ride the hype train. [b]Scythe[/b] is about all anyone can talk about lately, and it’s not hard to see why: beautiful art, detailed rules, a simple flow of play, asymmetry, and mechs, who doesn’t love mechs? Still, after two plays I have a concern: the first place player has typically blown the second place player out of the water by roughly 33%. Now, I’ve [i]only[/i] played twice, so I’m not holding that against it quite yet, but the game ending as abruptly as it does causes problems. I will keep playing and I’d love to see that problem go away with experience. 

Tentatively recommended.

I like this game a lot...solitaire. The components are top-notch, and the Automa opponent is well crafted (if a bit tricky to learn at first). The problem is that I will have a hard time ever getting a multiplayer game out of it, since the attacking is a huge turn off for my groups.

Very good game with a lot of deep strategy.  It is possible to play without interacting much with other players in a 2 player game which gets a bit harder to do in 4 and 5 player games.  Also, the 5 player games tend to have more downtime which may be a problem for some.  This game feels just right for me 2-3 players.

RATING: 8
Kinda steep learning curve starting out but once you get it, it's an amazing game. I found it more fun just to play and not worry about actually winning than anything else. For this game it's all about the journey, not the destination.

I have now played 7 games. 4 of them the 1 player automata variation and 3 of them with 5 or less people. I can say the game plays just as good with 5 people as it does with 2 or 3. Also the 1 player game is really fun! It changes the way the game is played a little bit for the opposing automa and is really clever. 

One downside that I have found after playing numerous games. It seems that you really should put more focus into your popularity over everything else in the game. Since popularity has a strong dictation towards final score you are more likely to end up winning over the guy who has completely ignored popularity. That being said the endgame counting up points is by far my least favorite part of the game. I love the resource management and game play and honestly don't care if I win or lose because the fun I have with the game is more than enough for me.

After one play: I really really don't understand what people see in this game.

After giving this game a second chance:  When looking at what the rating system says here, I had no choice but to drop my rating of this game down to a 2.  Because for 2 it says "Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again."  The nicest thing I can say about this game is that the metal coins are really cool.  The artwork, close up, is good, but the overall presentation looks like a giant Technicolor yawn.  I suppose if I got sucked into the hype and spent a fortune on this turd I'd probably be trying to convince myself and others that this game is awesome, too.  But I didn't, so I am telling you that this game definitely is not for me as it annoys me and I won't play it anymore.

Awesome game and one of my favourites in my collection. The mechanics are great, faction/mech abilities are diverse and cool, each faction plays differently, so much replayability and the expansion about to be released. Played this with 2-4 players several times now, each game has been great from start to finish.

Jan/17: Played it more with the expansion, 5 and 6 player games which were all solid. Great game.

Although listed as a 4x game, I cannot agree with that categorization. I DO find this to be a terrific action-selection game, and as such it is splendid.

The little 'mech minis' in the game invoke a more combative atmosphere than is realized in the game, however, they do serve a solidly useful purpose beyond the aggressive image they impose. Everything in the game has a purpose, and I find no 'wastful' mechanisms...the whole package comes together beautifully.

Without doubt, the most beautiful game I own. A pleasure to behold on the table. My only quibble is I feel that there is one or two too many aspects to keep track of in the game. That is as much a critique on my ability to fully comprehend the game as the game design. It is by far the most complex game I have had to explain the rules for and I have yet to come up with an efficient way to teach it.

In true saved-by-the-bell fashion, at our weekly game night, I was yanked out of Scythe for a 2-player game with a late arrival.

[i]Initial impressions:[/i]

It reminds me of Eclipse, which is bad.

It has at least 4-6 too many rules, which is bad.

It's a kickstarter game.  Not good.

The game I avoided lasted only 60 minutes, which was barely twice as long as the rules explanation. That's messed up.

[i]Update:[/i]

Something is wrong when 8 of the top 10 games on BGG were released in the past five years.  There's no way this is the top 7 game of all time.

Played it 3 times, which is quite a feat.
I kinda like it, I tought I would like it a bit better. Not sure why that is.
The board is beautiful and the turns are swift.
Maybe it's the fact that from looking at the box I expect a game with a different feel.

If you really like area-control and combat (which I don't) I think there are better suited games. I do like that combat is swift and not all too devasting if you lose a battle.

If you like tight euro games (which I sometimes do), I think there are also better games.

If you really like a streamlined combination of the two, I'd day "Try it out".

Still, so far this is the Stegmaier game I've played so far which I like best.
Will play when asked, but probably never with more than 5.

This game is fun, and pretty well realized.  Keeping turns to a single top/bottom action selection and obfuscating the score standing prevents two of the games potential down sides - long turns/AP and the possibility of a runaway leader if you -know- you're ahead.  Both are well mitigated by thoughtful design thanks to thoughtful designers.
OK, now the gush for things that dont necessarily make the game, but are cool - great board and art, and this is one of the coolest and most original themes of any game in my collection.
Love it and cant wait to get it to the table with all the people who will appreciate it.

It plays like a single player game for the first 1/3-1/2 as you get your economy going, then you start having to think about competition or combat with other players.


The box is quite good quality - there are separately designed mechs and "hero" for each faction. There were also a large number of bags that can be used to sort the pieces. This was a nice touch - most other games don't bother with this.

Theme/Art:
Scythe is the most beautiful game I own. Jakub Rozalski is an amazing artist and the art is 11/10, if not more.  Same goes for the theme as the game sets place in an alternative history in the 1920s where countries build giant battle mechs.

Production quality:
Amazing production quality, the board has 2 sides with one having a bigger map so you have more space for resources (you need to purchase a board extension to use it), the miniatures are very good, and every faction has different worker meeples, which is a nice touch. Nothing feels cheap in Scythe.

Replayability:
There are 5 factions with different abilities and different starting resources and also 5 player mats with different top and bottom rows, as well as different action costs. So you have to take a different approach each game, even if you play the same faction twice.

Depth/Difficulty:
The game takes a bit to explain, but it is actually not that hard and once you get the hang of it it has a nice flow. Since everybody only takes one top row action and maybe a bottom one on his turn, you don't have to wait long until you are up again.
The game has very interesting mechanics, especially how the game ends. Once someone placed all their 6 stars it's over. So if you are ahead and only have one star to place you can end the game immediately, but if you are behind in money you can drag the game out by not placing your last star (unless someone else places all their stars of course).
The fact that you don't get resources you produced into your supply, but they are placed on the hex they are produced on, is also very interesting, because you can steal resources from others if they don't watch out.
I also like that the encounter cards have no text on them (aside from your options), but only a picture of the scene, so you have to interpret it in your own way.
I weight it 3/5.

Strategy:
Scythe is a strategy game, so of course their is a lot of strategy involved. Your strategy should depend on your faction, player mat, and starting position. There are 10 ways to plays stars, but you only need to place 6 to end the game, so focus on 6 of those ways. E.g. if you draw shitty objectives, ignore them.
Oh, and get your popularity up to at least 13, you need it for the scoring!

Luck:
Aside from your starting setup (faction and player mat) and the cards you draw (encounters, objectives, factory cards) there is no luck involved. Even combat is not luck, but using power and power cards (and knowing how much power your enemy will spend.

Scythe takes about 80-150 minutes to play, depending on player count and how familiar players are with the game. Teaching the rules takes about 20 minutes.

In summary I like Scythe very much and it is the best looking game I own at the moment. We will see if its rating stays that high after a few more plays.

Scythe bietet einfach alles, was mein Brettspielherz höher schlagen lässt. Vom phänomenalen Artwork, über den geschichtlichen Hintergrund bis zur unterschiedlichen Ausrichtung der Charakter-Tafeln ist alles so durchdacht, dass kein Spiel wie das andere ist. Auch Kleinigkeiten wie die eingestanzten Charakter-Tafeln oder unterschiedlichen Figuren und Mechs machen eindeutig den Unterschied.

Though Scythe contains a lot of aspects that are turn offs to me (Dudes-on-a-map, miniatures, PvP attacking, Asymmetric starting powers, 2+ hours playtime ...) I loved my first game. Turns swoosh by, and it allows for different strategies to explore.

01/03/2017:
Less and less interested by this game: I'm wandering around, I don't feel I achieving something during the game, the beginning is slow but the end too fast, I don't build an engine, I think the factions should be either completely the same (without special powers) or completely different (action boards, objectives, ... specific to factions)

Like many others, I figured that Scythe was going to be pretty combat-driven. That was fine, because I like a lot of dudes-on-a-map (where they're fighting each other) games. But Scythe is not very combat-driven, despite having combat. It's more of a strategic objective completion game - and I love it far more than if it had been a streamlined dudes-on-a-map game. I love the engine-building part of the player boards, the fact that you (usually) can only complete each objective once, the exploration cards, the various faction abilities, the turns being lightning quick... the list goes on. It's a big, beautiful optimization puzzle to me, but a puzzle where your opponents can throw some wrenches into the gears. And I'm 100% down with that.

The art is fantastic and the component quality is really good, but it does have a fairly large footprint - especially with the extended board.  Our table is 3'x5' and we won't be using the extended board because it doesn't fit if you also want to have space for your player mats.  The variable player/faction mats are good to encourage you to try different strategies, as does having multiple ways to earn stars.  Really great experience.

I got to play my copy of the [thing=169786][/thing] Collectors Edition twice last night and I'm happy that I did... and not for reasons that you might think immediately.

Scythe, at face value, seemed like a very complex machine of many intricate moving parts. The strategies didn't seem all that apparent to me and figuring out how to best manage the combination of upper-row actions with the bottom-row actions in concert with your specific faction abilities and their starting location resources, etc. seemed daunting. Needless to say... I struggled mightily in the first game and got thoroughly trounced. The surprising thing was that (a 3 player game, with teaching mind you) played out rather quickly. So... with time to spare in our game night, we decided to try it again and switch up factions and player mats.

This second game played out drastically different and allowed me to really see how Scythe will play over the long haul. Each and every faction has unique abilities and benefits in their starting positions. But, pair that with an action board that is random and provides drastically different pairings of actions and associated costs, and the puzzle and strategy really grows.

Having seen what some other players had benefited from in our first game, and trying to play to my faction's strengths, I ended up pulling off a pretty decent win. The one player that had thoroughly destroyed two of us in the first game seemed to be in the running to destroy us again in the early to mid game but ended up running their engine thin and struggled a bit at the end. This allowed my slow build-up to get steamrolling and come back for the victory.

I'll probably do a full review of the game at some point but these are my initial thoughts.

As I said at the beginning, I'm happy that we played the game twice last night because if we had ended it after the first play, I think that I wouldn't have enjoyed the game as much as I do now. Winning the second game aside, the second play actually gave me a feel for Scythe and what it has to offer moving forward. I wouldn't say that it's a 4X game by any stretch but it does feel like you're dipping your toe in that pond. My best description would be a less combat intensive [thing=127023][/thing] with resource management minus the robust tech-tree, or maybe [thing=72125][/thing]-lite. It definitely didn't have a ton of combat (in the 3 player game), although the second game did ramp up a bit. I imagine that would only increase with player count and/or with added experience though. And, the engine-building / resource management really came through quite a bit to me. The fact that it plays so quickly is also a bonus. Being able to knock two games out in less than 3 hours is amazing. One game of Eclipse would easily take at least that long!

All-in-all... I'm very excited about this game. From a cautiously optimistic view of the game after my first play to instant "Awesomesauce!" after the second. I can't wait to delve deeper in to the game and play it again soon!

For first timers, this game is very tricky to understand and can easily take an hour + just figuring out the game mechanics. However once you get passed all that, this game feels like a tabletop version of a video game and you can easily feel immersed in the landscape of Europa. I'd definitely like to play again.

2 player learning game had a dry, solitaire tinge to it. The artwork and components are exceptional - best art of the year. 

The game experience felt lopsided because you have a huge map game board with miniatures on the table but you spend most of the game durdling around on the little player board in front of you.

I look forward to playing this again so I can continue to form my opinion about the game.

Definitely a better game with 4-5 although I've taught this game a few too many times now and would prefer to play with those that know it (the rules explanation can take up to 30 mins if players want to know everything in advance). I look forward to trying the expansion factions.

I dislike that this game looks like it has a lot of player interaction, but in reality is a boring slow overly long engine builder that does very little to inspire me to replay it let alone teach someone else how to play it so we can play together. Games need to look good enough to teach (this does), and have mechanics that inspire them being taught (this doesn't). If I want to play a basic engine builder I'll play something tighter in a smaller box with player interaction and some thoughtful variable game interactions that encourage replayability rather than this mess. I'll put this one down to just not being my cup of tea and accept that I just don't enjoy "Euro" games. A math puzzle VP fest is simply put not my kind of fun.

I have mixed feelings about Scythe. The production is great, it plays with little downtime, and does a great job of balancing area control and worker placement.

On the other hand, the hybrid (worker placement, area control) design means it is not excellent in either category. For area control, I'd rather play Inis. For medium weight euro, Clans of Caledonia (CoC) does similar mechanics better.

In comparison to CoC, CoC provides more focus to the player with the Clan powers. This exists in Scythe with the different player boards, but either isn't as transparent or the powers aren't strong enough to really push the player in a specific direction. In CoC, I won't be able to do everything on my board, I have to focus on a specific strategy to be successful. In Scythe, I always upgrade everything on my player board 3/4's through the game.

My guess is that 2 player scaling is at the core of my issues (as we have not included Automa). The variable end conditions from The Wind Gambit may also help.

I will update my rating/thoughts once we have played with both.

Game looks amazing and plays really well. Might be a little overhyped? up to you to decide, I still don't know but the fact that I'm thinking that says something. Need to play it more and try different strategies.

Gorgeous illustrations, easy to learn and a ton of tactics and actions to chose from. Really nice components. AND MECHS!!! Get the board-extension if you don't have it already, because playing one of the best looking games of all is mandatory on the biggest board possible. Best with 4 players and it's of course the main game at your gaming night!

Interesting system, but feels like the game forces your strategy with the combination of faction and board with the inability to take the same action twice in a row.  Some luck elements seem to drive the winner as well.

Aah! Finally got to play this and it was GOOD. So beautiful and well-balanced and surprisingly intuitive. A lot of Terra Mystica in it, which is a definite plus. I love seeing all the little touches that have been put into the game by a designer who has clearly thought a lot about making the players' experience smooth and enjoyable. Cannot wait to try out the different factions and just explore the world.

Artwork is beyond words.

Played twice 2p game. Not so many interaction between us, but I think it will improve more when it's an above-3-players game, and more combat . With the expansion we have two more faction mat as well as two player mats to select, that's always good to have more options to choose. 

Automa solo mode is good, elegant design.

Have to play more to get the certain thoughts for this game.

update to 10 after more plays.

I really like the paired action selection spaces in Scythe.  Trying to maximize my chances of using every aspect of a space as often as possible really appealed to me.  I did have a lot of trouble reading the board state though as the tunnel warping and riverwalk made some things closer together and some things farther apart than one would expect at a glace.  But as I've gained experience with the game that's largely gone away (though I still need to ask "Where can you Riverwalk again?" a couple times a game...).  A very satisfyingly fast civ type game that I'm very much looking forward to exploring further!

I am loving this game!

The good:
-The action selection mechnism
-The awesome factions with neat powers
-The upgrade mechanism
-The theme
-The components
-Clean combat
-Multible paths to victory
-Artwork
-Encounters are great
-The map
-The depth of play
-MECHS!

The bad:
-High learning curve. You will loose against someone who's played the game before
-Not as attacky as you might think. It's more euro than war game
-Erupt ending(I don't mind that but some do)

It is a beatiful game, I like the aspect of gathering resources and upgrading. It is a very engaging game though, but I cannot feel  a strong attatchment to the game.  For me It feels the same as other "gather-sell" resources game. I am not fan of eurogame and I try to keep my collection small so for me Scythe is not essencial if you have other gathering resources such as voyages of marco polo, caverna or agricola.

A fascinating game and have now played a variety of different factions. I find the game takes too long, seems almost lumbering, above 5. 4 or 5 is the sweet spot. 

We've also found the game bogs down near the end as everyone jockeys for the last few points trying to min-max everything. You can see the end coming and you just need to try to finish.

One annoying aspect is that you can start the game in a totally untenable situation. You can have goals that are simply unrealistic meaning something usually doable isn't. We resolved this by giving everyone 3 and letting them keep two, similar to Ticket to Ride. Helps more. We might opt for take 2 of 4 as one of the players got hosed last game again. 

It will definitely hit our table again but it's fallen a bit courtesy of length and some stronger games that have become group favourites of late.

Gyönyörű rajzokkal, komponensekkel teli, hevibe hajló euró. A frakciók és a hozzájuk kapcsolódó képességek sokszori újrajátszást biztosíthatnak az erre fogékonyaknak. A 2 órás játékidőből sokat nem lehet lefaragni, így ennek tudatában üljön le mki elé. A harcok kicsit furcsák (semmilyenek?) voltak elsőre, de igazából nem ront a játékélményen. A játék íve és a fejlesztések miatt az első fele határozottan izgalmasabb, a másodikra viszont kicsit leülhet a dolog, de lehet csak mi fáradtunk el az első szabálymagyarázattal teli játékban. Számomra mindenképpen még kipróbálós.
Egyelőre egy hájpos 8, aztán majd meglátjuk.

Collectors edition makes this game one of the top component quality games I have ever owned, and even my friends who shrink away from any game of over an hour, keep asking to bring this to the table again and again. Great theming, and a very positive mix of engine building and worker placement. My only caution is that the first time someone plays the game, they will make mistakes that can often impact their ability to win the game, so tread friendly with the strat and rules for a player's first time

I did playtest this game at Essen. I really wanted to like this game, so I could back it on kickstarter. However, it failed to win me over. For me the theme didn´t really connect to the mechanic - which is a shame with such wonderful artwork. The development/engine building was very confusing at first - and once you got the hang of it, you wondered why, since it doesn´t introduce anything new.
We actually broke off the demo early, because nobody really had the drive to play on.

The game playes nice and easy!
But i don't like the grapics/colors of the board with the hold and plastik figures, No consistency in design. The minatures don't stand out on the board. 
It also feels if theme is past on the mecanics. Where is Scythe in this game?

Very much enjoyed our first play of this. Game reminds me a bit of Terra Mystica. The same puzzle how to start your engine going and plop your structures/workers etc down is in this game too, but I felt having a bit more variance in this game than in TM. I hope the variance (faction tech, objective, random player mat, encounter cards) will continue to have the effect that not every game with the same faction plays out the same. 

Love how the resources are placed on the board so you need to protect them. Factions feel different and interesting. Combat feels just right (even though I'm more into wargames), not punishing but an interesting tactical way to offset and block the others. Everyone felt always threatened like in a cold war style. It's more a matter of control and gives you a decision to make : spread out or keep together. 

I also love the little details in gamedesign for example how you get to hold 2 objectives so you still can switch strategy. It's a small something but it shows experience and insight in good gamedesign. 

Minor nitpick : felt like 6 stars ends the game just a little bit too early.

Plays very fast, looks great. Primarily an efficiency euro game. Your strategy is somewhat constrained by your starting boards (your action sets, which are slightly different for everyone). You can ignore the obvious efficiency incentives to make your own plan, but you probably won't win... The many different combinations of special powers and action boards does give it good immediate replayability.

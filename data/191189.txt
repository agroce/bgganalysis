Euro gamer at heart, never really enjoyed the deck builders. I got this game based on Rahdo's gameplay and because I wanted a good co-op that wasn't pandemic. I really enjoyed my first few playthroughs. Most other deck builders of this type, shadowrift, thunderstone, mistfall, etc all have so many situational rules I never even cared to try them. This game is great because it's easy to get out and just start playing. My husband and I taught our 11 year old how to play in only a few minutes and we went on to kill the Carapace Queen in a very exciting "by the skin of our teeth" victory. In a collection of over 300 games, this is the only one right now that I would play several times in a row and still want more.

I like how the players must pick a strategy to specifically defeat the boss in front of them, and that your first attempt will pretty much fail and then you get to discuss what you could do differently, what worked or didn't, etc.

This is a really difficult game that you aren't supposed to win every game, and I like that.  I could see it not being as popular in a playgroup that doesn't replay games often, but I plan on playing it quite a bit and learning the bosses and mechanics so this is a great fit.

Great co-op deckbuilder. Challenging and enforcing teamwork. Nice twist on turn order. The new look that came with the Update Pack makes the artwork pop now.

Each nemesis has a different feel to it and the different mages are interesting as well.

Got the Kickstarter Promopack.

Another co-op deckbuilder, but I appreciate not having to shuffle my deck. My memory, however, is just not always up to the challenge of remembering its order.

As you can probably imagine, it does nothing super new (though the rifts are original), but everything it does it does very well.

Saying that this is a very solid game sounds like damning with faint praise, but that's the best term I can think of.

One of the best cooperative deck builders out there.  If you don't work together and assist each other during turns, you don't stand a chance of winning.

RATING: 7.2
Bit of setup required, but the plus side to that is once underway, the game mechanics take care of themselves so that you can focus on your deck and attacks. Fun both solo and with 2 (haven't played with more). Some artwork is good, some is blah. Theme concept is good, but during the game, not sure how much theme really comes through. Eight different characters and four very different bosses mean replay is really varied, each game feels different.

RATING: 10
I don't give this a 10 lightly. This game is immaculately flawless. The gameplay is on a whole other level of perfect. First, let me start with the physical components because inside this box are some negative qualities, just none to do with the game itself:

-These components are comically flimsy and easily damaged. The cards feel thin, become damaged immediately (even in the shrinkwrap) and absolutely REQUIRE high quality sleeves the day you open the box. If not, you will be subjected to the torture of how unimaginably bad they feel. Touching the cards feels like having your soul sucked through your ear, or raking a chalkboard with your fingernails. I have no idea how they even accomplished this impressive feat of human torment. The gates are also awful. I recommend premium Mayday clear fitted sleeves for this game, and cut a few of them square for the gates. You will thank me.

The good (components):

-Comes with (albeit flimsy) dividers to organize your collection and an insert (flimsy) that can separate all the cards (plus first expansion) from the other components very nicely. It's perfectly organized such that absolutely nothing is difficult to set up.

-Randomizer cards (like Dominion) are a massive plus and make setup a breeze.

Gameplay breakdown:
-Variable player powers are very strong and desirable to use as much as possible. Tons of characters for a ridiculous level of replayability. Bonus for lady gamers like me: the majority of characters are women. Each character has a unique starting deck to give them even further differentiation.

-Every Nemesis feels 100% different and seems to even follow different rules. Your strategies shouldn't be identical every game.

-Hardmode (that feels actually hard) for when you get too good at the game.

-Dominion-style market of draftable cards. The Star Realms style of conveyor belt is incredibly random and isn't really desired for this kind of game where you need a plan quickly, and have to stick to it rather than just take whatever's best for you.

-NO RANDOMNESS except turn order and super minor-barely-noticable-random-order of the individual tiers of Nemesis cards, though not their whole deck. All the randomness feels not only necessary but actually fun. This INCLUDES your decks. You never shuffle, technically giving players the capacity to think many turns ahead. Hands never get samey due to choices you can make influencing deck order.

-Very fun casting system. You cast as your first phase of the turn and "prepare" spells ahead of time (without any cost at all). So you're always planning a turn ahead, but also other players can use effects that cast your cards for you. Also, you cast using open gates that act sort of like spell slots, except when they're closed you can pay a minor aether (mana/gold) cost to "focus" them, which moves them one step closer to being fully open and also lets you prep a spell in that slot that turn. It makes for some very interesting and deep gameplay choices.

Basically every single aspect of this gameplay is perfectly executed. I'm not sure if the deckbuilder genre will ever top this gem. I can even tolerate the component quality when it's sitting at $33 (with super cheap expansions) and some cheap sleeves fix the problem completely. One day, I would love to own a revamped version even if it costs more.

I hope this gets expansions forever.

The difficulty in this game is well cloaked.
My first 4 games, the Nemesis didn't pose much of a threat.  I was beginning to question the reviewers that said this was one of the more difficult co-ops.
Now I've lost the last 2 I played and I couldn't be more stoked!  The one loss we just got our engines going, doing 10+ damage per turn, had the Nemesis down to 29, then she got 2 turns in a row and annihilated the City.  The 2nd loss, we got the Nemesis down to 1.  All we had to do was go first on the next reshuffle of the turn order deck.  We didn't.  We lost.  Exciting!

I love the turn order deck. Not shuffling your deck seems like a cool idea (but ultimately, I'm not counting my deck so it's not that huge of a thing). It's a fun game to explore - I definitely want to give the Carapace queen another try.

RATING: 9
A highly addictive deck builder set in a fascinating, well-realized world. Darker than most fantasy games, AE challenges players to stay alive long enough to prevent the destruction of humanity's last citadel. Game play is crisp and tense, with an astonishing variety of mages, spells, relics, and gems. Enemies play very differently, requiring precise tactics and a coherent strategy tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of each opponent. Plays very well solitaire.

It's the first physical copy of a deck-builder in my collection. And it's proving to be a worthy acquisition. 

Was apprehensive over whether my SO would enjoy a deck-building game but it's been a hit with her.

Apart from the time it takes to set up, the market and the deck creation for the nemeses (similar to Eldritch Horror's Ancient Ones), the game is engrossing and flows extremely well once you've got the rules down.

This game is and shall be one of my all time favorites. Im the eldest of three brothers, and originally got this as a way to bond with my younger siblings, each who are 6 years apart. Let me say one thing, you know a game is good when an hour later everyone is refusing to eat in order to take down the Nemesis. We have gone for hours trying to come up with new strategies in order to beat creatures that can stomp us in a jiggly mass of gelatin and despair...IT IS AWESOME!

Not in love with all the components for this, but it is a great dark fantasy alternative to games like Sentinels of the Multiverse or Galactic Strike Force with a handful of fresh mechanics that will engage you, and more of a deck building vibe. Each boss feels pretty different to one another, as do the way the individual characters' abilities pan out. With some expansions this could become a great go-to and I always welcome games that work solo.

Played it at two players, at four players, easy settings, normal settings and with a couple different Nemeses. It is a fun puzzle to solve. Would willingly play this at any time. When we won, we won with only two hit points left. When we lost, we were one round from winning. Very difficult and almost always down to the wire.

Initial Impression: My comments for this game are similar to the War Eternal edition with regards to component quality and gameplay. I would add that the Nameless and breachmages from this edition seem to play a little more straightforward than those found in War Eternal. I'll happily step up to the challenge.

Deckbuilding cooperative game with beautiful graphics and good and immersive fluff and thematics. Lots of replayability.

One solo play so far, which I narrowly lost, but it's hugely enjoyable. I guess it just ticks a lot of boxes for me.

Fun, Fun Fun, so far but I'll update after a few more plays. Hopefully with a 2 player tryout too.

Deck builders typically don't hold my attention for long or I'll straight up dislike them for being incredibly swingy toward your win or loss. And it always seemed like a genre that I SHOULD like, because I love the feeling of progression of power in any game.

In Aeon's End however, the fact that your building a fixed deck and have control over how your cards are discarded really makes the game shine for me!

Every game I've played so far also has been extremely close in terms of winning or losing, but there's also options in the booklet that allow you to scale the difficulty. Many of the abilities you can buy encourages you to aid other players to create fantastic combos. I appreciate the fact that there's no player elimination, though quite a few bad things happen each time a player loses all of their health. Coming from similar games like Sentinels of the Multiverse, this also feels extremely streamlined as you only have to worry about a few tokens at a time.

I honestly haven't felt this excited about a mostly card-driven game in such a loooooooong time. There seems to be quite a bit of variation of item/character/monster choices already packed into the box, but I truly hope this gets lots of love and expansions anyway - I'm going to buy every single one!

My only gripe with it is that the single character solo mode doesn't quite work out nicely with some hero/monster/item combinations. But controlling two heroes at once instead is an easy fix that doesn't bump up the complexity too much.

Many on BGG also seem to rate this game low due to component quality, but I honestly don't find it that bad. I admit that the breach cards are ridiculously thin and awkwardly sized compared to the player boards...But the loose dials don't cause problems if you don't go lifting the thing all willy nilly, and the art as is helps immerse you into a bleak world that's already ended even though it's not particularly eye catching from afar.

Backed on kickstarter April 2016. 

What I like: A deckbuilder where you don't have to shuffle, some cool combos are possible with card layout, the variability and variety with different bosses cards. Also, players really work together and strategize all game giving the game a good coop vibe.

What I don't like: The game feels like it goes too long, the set up can be a bit of hassle but gets better as you play more,the "wild card" in the 3 player game feels very tacked on and can mean some players get several more turns than others, the components feel a bit cheap (warping cardboard, dials are very loose, etc.).

Overall I think this game has some fun ideas. I really like the variability and I find it much more interesting to play than Dominion. However, the game goes on too long and there aren't really a lot of exciting moments. It is sort of a grind and there just isn't anything really engaging that happens all game. I've introduced this game to new gamers and it has been a fun coop experience for them. While I don't think it is a bad game, I don't think this is one I will keep in my collection for a long time. The 4 player experience was much better than the 3 player experience as well.

Very boring and lacked interesting or meaningful decisions. That's not to say the illusion of choice doesn't exist, because it does. But what makes these choices illusory is the fact that they don't decide anything about the course of the game and are there seemingly to keep players occupied while the game stumbles forward to its inevitable conclusion.

I thought that People can't be right with stating that this could really be some much better deck Building game.
But hey... it really is. First of all the different Nemesis you face act really different. If randomly Chose the Cards for your game, it is fun to even try to succeed with weaker spells, or to wait until you have enough "Money" to be able to buy the more expensive spells. And in the end, this General Change to Keep Cards in Hand and NOT to Shuffle your discard pile... sounds so simple... but does so much Magic. Really happy to have bought this one.

I like the idea of a co-op dominion. Aeon's End is an engaging experience with some interesting design nuances for the genre. 

The game has a ton of variability but I didn't feel like the cards worked well together. Without cohesion, most of the cards played like a singular weighty action. Couple this with the turn-order deck and non-shuffling discard piles and you get an adventurous grind.

One of my better kickstarter gambles. This game is great, I like co ops and I like deck building so this ticks both of those. I really like the co op elements here - it's not so easy to alpha game and dominate others but it does encourage co op/team work. Brilliant first game experience out of the box, we just opened the packs as instructed and played after a 5 minute shared rulebook read (only stuff you do on your turn and the nemesis turn). 

Lots of variety with the different bosses and mages and gems, relics and spells, although I think you need to select carefully going up against the harder bosses, both the mages you play and the market cards to stand a chance.

RATING: 9.5
This is amazing!

I've only played one game so far, but I can already see the massive replayability and variety that this game has to offer: there is a randomized card pool for players to purchase from (like other deckbuilders), there are a load of unique characters to try with their own strengths and weaknesses (different abilities, charge levels, starting decks and hands, and starting breach setup), and a load of different nemeses to face, which in themselves will be different from game to game due to the basic cards that will be added to their nemesis decks.

The rules are very simple and clear, and the rulebook will rarely be needed for a reference. It plays smooth, and, in my opinion, out-performs all other fantasy deck-builders currently out there. Although, this one is purely cooperative, so something to consider for those who like other competitive deckbuilders.

I highly recommend checking this one out!

Edit: I'm even more impressed after my second play! It was so close, but barely squeaked in a win! The turn order deck can be very suspenseful and just might ruin your day!

A pleasant surprise. Mechanically, it seems like yet another generic Dominion-style deckbuilder. The artwork is not great, and the overall graphic design looks like someone made this game on their 2004 iMac. Fortunately, a few things distinguish this from other similar games: 

1) The "no shuffling" mechanic. I love being able to set up combos and manage my hand rather than just having to play everything I draw. It makes this game much more strategic, as you might want to reserve cards in your hand to set up a combo in your discard pile.

2) Opening the breaches. This also makes this game more strategic, as you have to plan for the "long game," spending precious time early in the game (getting your butt kicked in the process) to set up a powerful engine at endgame.

3) "Charging "up" your heroes. This gives you yet another decision space that not only makes for even more interesting card combos, but also makes each game you play feel different as you exploit your character's special abilities. 

Combined with the replayability of a changing card pool and the different effects of the villains (plus expansions on the way), this has the potential to become my absolute favorite deckbuilder. Who'd have thought?!

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great post-apocalyptic/fantasy cooperative deck-building game, which remind the players of RPG games, in which the alpha-player syndrome is minimal, which is great.
++ I love that you don't shuffle your deck: just flip it over and you're set! This minimize downtime and also add to the strategy in which you play/discard your cards.
++ I love the turn order deck with which you never exactly know when your next turn (or the Nemesis one) will be. This give a great tension and exciting moments. Also, it's still giving player enough information as the round progress, which can lead to some more strategy.
++ The game come with a lot of variability in each game setup to give some really great replayability: there is several characters that can be played, several Nemesis that can be fought against with a lot of basic Nemesis cards that are included in the Nemesis deck that also change the way the Nemesis will fight and there is a great quantity of Market cards (and thus strategies) that are available to the players.
++ I really love that each Nemesis have really different fighting behavior and/or ways to win/lose the game (by adding some new mechanism/components in there). This is really fun to first explore and understand how they fight (and how to respond), and then it leads to really different strategy we must follow, thus increasing the replayability. 
++ There is a really nice sense of escalation in this game as the Nemesis deck is set in tiers that become harder and harder to fight against as the game progress.
++ The theme is really interesting and somewhat fresh in it genre. It's fun to read the flavor text on cards and on the back of the characters playmat.
++ The is a lot of small-box expansions to add new content if you want "more of the same".
++ Except from some issues (see negative comment on components), most of the component are of good quality for the price. 
++ Somewhat easy to teach and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The card quality is inconsistent: most of the cards have a smooth glossy finish, but some of them have a rough texture to them. I don't really care since I have sleeved all my cards, but it's a known issues unfortunately with at least the first print run for the AE:WE Kickstarter.
-- Even though I have the Second Edition, there are still a few typos on the cards (bad background, poorly phrase cards, etc.)
-- I find it really sad to have duplicate art on some gems (exact same art, but with a different color). Also there are 3 type of gems that look almost the same at first glance and from across the table.
-- There is not a different card number between the cards from Aeon's End: Second Edition and Aeon's End:War Eternal, so for some people it may be annoying if you want to know which card come from which game. But all small-box expansions have a unique starting letter to the card number.
-- The setup time and tear down time is longer than I would wish, but we have find some ways to minimize it: When we make a new setup (market cards and Nemesis deck), we reuse the same setup as long as we haven't won with it (we may change characters though and sometime, if the market is too harsh for this Nemesis, we may change 1 card stack). When we win, we only change roughly half the Market cards for new ones (between 3 to 4 card stacks), and change the Nemesis basic cards for the same Nemesis, until we have won easily a few times against this Nemesis (until we find that we have really figured out this one). This also help us master the cards' power (only half the cards to learn instead of all 9 of them) Then again, even if for a next game we would play another Nemesis, we always keep roughly half the current Market cards and go to the next Nemesis up the difficulty scale. Finally, we also always setup the Market cards and the Nemesis deck at the end of the game (while talking about the game we just finished) to speed up the setup time for our next game.

Aeon's End blends together deck-building with a heroes vs. bad guys rock 'em sock 'em affair, like a mashup of Dominion and Sentinels of the Multiverse. While I really enjoy both of the games that it felt like this game smashed together, I didn't really like how this game did it.

On the deck-building front, it didn't feel like you were building an engine like you do in a game like Dominion. You were just adding more powerful things to your deck to overcome the weaksauce cards your deck begins with, and unlocking more slots to play more cards into. It felt like there was much less of a puzzle to figure out amongst the card selection in an effort to build an efficient engine, and more of a focus on just getting more "good stuff" in your deck.

It also got rid of the deck shuffle. While this does give you more control, I realized while playing that I really like the shuffle in other deck-builders. The unpredictability of a shuffle is just more fun for me.

On the heroes vs. bad guys front, the characters just seemed to lack any personality when compared to games like Sentinels of the Multiverse. In a game like Sentinels, you really feel like the heroes are distinct and have their own play styles. In Aeon's End, all the characters start very same-y with some minor differences, and then you ever-so-slowly differentiate them, but via a common pool  of cards to choose from. It left the characters feeling kind of "blah" in comparison to the cream of the crop games of this genre.

Overall, the game tried to do a couple clever things, like with the no-deck-shuffling and the variable turn order, but I found I just didn't like these admittedly novel tweaks, and the rest of the game was just less exciting than other comparables. I'm also not really grabbed by the whole b-rate fantasy looks/theme, which I know many others enjoy much more than I do. In the end, I can see why others are enjoying the game, but it's not for me.

Fun game. Reminds me a bit of XenoShyft (although everyone says it's more like Sentinels of the Multiverse but I haven't played the game).

Simple rules but lots of tough decisions to make: hammer the Nemesis? Heal Breach Mage? Attack minions? Destroy base cards? All the while the Gravehold counter is ticking down...

Plus variable Nemesis and market cards mean replay shoots through the roof. Plus you can actually build a specialist set of market cards to achieve a specific goal... excellent game!

I really like this deck building game.  There's lots of interesting mechanics to it.  The Turn Order deck makes you think about the different future possibilities.  I also like that you don't shuffle your discard pile, so you can try to plan certain hands for the future.  The number of characters and enemies that came with the kickstarter  will keep gameplay fresh for quite a while!

You play as a Breach Mage, the last line of defense against really big bad monsters eager to destroy the last desperate remnants of Civilization, who hang out in a place called Gravehold which, frankly, does not sound like a great place to party.  There you will attempt to make civilization's last stand against the darkness, armed only with a handful of crystals and a spell called 'spark' which is absolutely as ineffectual as it sounds.

Interesting Mechanic: Cooperative Deckbuilding.  There are a hoard of deckbuilding games, and there are a hoard of cooperative games, but these streams don't cross very often.  Aeon's End does so fairly elegantly.  Deckbuilding stacks are constant (like Dominion), and each mage has powers to help heal and manipulate the spells of their allies as they race against a rather aggressive clock.  

Aeon's End isn't an easy game, and the game is paced in such a way that you constantly feel like you are in more trouble than you actually are.  However, it does a very good job of creating a sense of cooperative stress and panic that is the hallmark of good cooperative games.

Simply awesome : this game gathers everything I like in a deckbuilding game. The fact that you never shuffle your deck is a great mechanism because it becomes more challenging to build your deck while the game advances. Each Breach mage has his own specificities and you will have to find the correct synergies among the team to be able to bring the Nemesis down. Each Nemesis is also very different, and you will have to build a new strategy for each one of them. In addition, the various market options will bring another source of replayability.

When I backed the game on Kickstarter, I felt it would be a great one, but it has even gone beyond my expectations.

I quite like: the uncertainty of variable turn order, the game-to-game variation of market cards, the very different bosses, flipping your discard instead of reshuffling, the feel of escalating power as the game goes on, that you can spend on Rifts + Charges in addition to just "more cards".

I'm less fond of: the feel of winning via chipping away at a large pool of boss HP (which is basically just a victory progress-bar that has no effect until complete), the Wild turn-order card in 3p, the typical deckbuilder "all my starting cards are meh" sensation, the different characters feeling nearly identical during early-game. (Not, in fairness, that they [i]were[/i] nearly identical - they have different starting decks/setups, and our special abilities informed our respective deck plans. But we weren't doing much differently from each other.)

What cooperative games should be like: everyone has enough to do that no player is tempted to micromanage the others' turns, and actual cooperation (splitting up roles, as opposed to everyone playing a solitaire game at the same time) often makes the difference between victory and defeat.

Kickstarted; Love this one 2-player!  This is a unique spin on the co-op deckbuilder.  You have the market as usual, but each mage is different.  Your starting hand is different and you have to work towards opening enough "breaches" in order to use your hand efficiently.  This is also the only deck-builder that I've seen that let's you stack your deck and not shuffle.

I definitely think that this game may be easier with 2 or 3 players than it was with 4.  We had one 4 player game against the blight lord that ended in about 15 minutes.   That put an extremely sour taste in some peoples mouths about this game.  I think the blight lord may have been hard enough without the track.  That's what ended up killing us quickly.  We didn't get any chance to build up our decks.  I'm still enjoying it (even though it can be a bit overly brutal), but I'm afraid it may not make it out at game night ever again because of how tough the 4 player game can be.

Aeon's End feels like a cross between Sentinels of the Multiverse and Thunderstone,

I think Sentinels is more interesting both mechanically and thematically, but it suffers from the major drawback that I am incapable of actually playing it correctly.  Thxere is just way too much to track and oddities of how effects should be applied for my simple brain.  For this reason I love Sentinels as an app, but sold the cards.

Aeon's End streamlines the "take down the boss" concept considerably to produce a game that is actually playable in real life.  AE is also better suited to 2 player play than SotM.  However, after a few plays of the AE base game I am wondering if I will eventually find it to be too straightforward.  It's actually making we contemplate going back to SotM for live play again, but I know that way lies madness.  For now I'm still enjoying working through the first 4 AE bosses.  

Also I find this game is much more innovative and balanced than Thunderstone. 

The big question for me will be for how long will I find AE interesting.   I am already pretty much done with the two easiest bosses. I am eager to see whether the other two and the expansions will maintain replayability.  Looking ahead at the expansion cards, however, they seem to be just more variations along the axes of damage, aether, card destruction, life, charging, and breach opening.  Pretty much the same as the base game but in different combos as far as I can tell.

Aeon's End is a cooperative deckbuilding game. The game it's closest to, in my mind, is Sentinels of the Multiverse. Though, I haven't played Marvel Legendary. I feel they are somewhat similar because you're each playing a hero that is trying to bring the big bad down to 0 health. There are alternative win conditions in Aeon's End and an alternative lose condition other than having the whole team knocked out. I don't normally like deckbuilding games versus tableau building games. I like this more than Sentinels of the Multiverse, though, because you don't constantly have to calculate least health, second least health, etc, etc. Aeon's End is also interesting due to the fact that you don't shuffle your deck. When you need cards from an empty deck, you flip your discard pile to become a new deck.

Beyond the way the you flip your deck, there are a lot of options to typically consider: charge up your ability, purchase a card (which card?), spin your breach... making it cheaper to open (you need open breaches to cast spells), temporarily open a breach, and more. There is a lot of variety in the box between the different starting characters, the different bosses, and various cards that can be placed in the market. Not only that, there are big box and small box expansions for virtually unlimited replay value. Overall, I consider this to be a great coop with great variability. I just hope they don't produce too much stuff for the game, the way they did for Sentinels of the Multiverse.

[b]Please Note[/b]: while the first edition of the base game is compatible with future expansions, the look will be jarring (think old ascension versus new ascension). If you're going to get into this game, start with the 2nd edition of the base game, or one of the stand alone expansions.

I love deckbuilders... so this was a no brainer.  Wish some of the components were sturdier, but so far so good.

Is slow to start for the mages, but I believe the nemesis deck build is commensurate with the speed of the mages builds.  At the end, the mages are really able to lay down some serious smack, but the nemesis deck is relentless at that point.

The setup really was easy and fully let you understand the setup for the rest of your plays.

I like the way this game lends itself to customizing your play based on what you like to accomplish.  I like being the support role, so those are the cards that I purchased, and I was always trying to either heal, charge, or focus other mages to allow them to rain the pain down on our nemesis.

I do like it and the replayability is through the roof.

Sold this and have never missed it. The game was fairly good, besides downtime issues. It was marred by crap components from an unapologetic publisher, which was too bad. I remember blowing off the comments made by Shut Up & Sit Down and thinking "Nah... can't be THAT bad..." but I was wrong. The result made the whole thing seem as if the publisher cut any corners they could, without respect for me or other prospective fans, which is fine. That's their approach. On some things that cost model probably works. For me, it's just not something I want to support.

A cool deck-builder that adds some interesting twists to the crowded genre. I like the discard mechanism where you flip over you deck instead of shuffling it. It adds a lot of tactic to the order in which you put your cards in the discard pile, very cool.

The player turn however while innovative doesn't really work for me, at least in a 2 player game. Where it is possible for between my turns to have the other player have 4 turns and the nemesis 4 turns as well. 4 or 3 nemesis turns in a row can really hit you hard with no chance of retaliation, which is kind of cheap.

The theme of the game is cool and the art is well done, the component quality however is abysmal. The cards show more wear than any other game I have seen right out of the shrink. It is quite stunning how low the quality of the cards is. I'm glad I don't have to shuffle them or this game wouldn't survive more than a few plays.

In 2015 maybe it could be a very good game, but nowadays you can find very similar better games like Clank! and Hero Realms + The ruin of Thandar.
What i don't like of this game is:
- the static market: if there aren't the cards you really need in order to defeat the nemesis you can't win;
- the turn sequence randomly decided by cards. It could be that you draw four times in a row the nemesis turn card and in this case you're dead;
- it's repetitive: the nemesis has a lot of life points and a game it's very long and turn by turn you alway do the same things. No plot, no twists.
- Breaches and player abilities. The first one could have been a nice mechanics but in my opinion it has no really meaning. When you finally open a breach... WOW! one more damage to the spell on it :-/ . Player abilities have a good impact in the game but aren't so characterising and it seems an implemented mechanic like: if you have some spare aether invest in it, or: if there aren't good cards in the market, invest all your aether in your ability.
- cheap materials, very low graphic. Tokens too small. Some typos. High price.

I recommend for the same genre Hero Realms + characters packs + The ruin of Thandar. Cheaper, better graphic, characters well characterised, right game length, with plot and many different endings, player advancement level, many different ways to play it and from 1 to 5 players.

I am not a huge fan of deck builders. I especially do not like Co-op deck builders. Legendary Encounters: Alien was a total dud for me. But Aeon's end is fantastic. The designer and developers clearly did a ton of research on all of the deck builders and coop games, figured out what made them tick and more importantly what made them stink. The basic formula multiple heroes against a nemesis mimics the setup of Sentinels of the Multiverse. Lots of co-ops have tried to add deck building to the basic Sentinels formula, but it works so well in Aeon's End because (a) the fixed market of cards to buy into your deck as you play gives you a ton of control, (b) the currency has uses beyond drafting new cards so you have meaningful decision making, (c) the nemesis deck is tiered into several levels so you don't get randomly thumped by the hardest card at the start of the game, and (d) no shuffling player decks and minimal management of the nemesis means the game plays super smoothly.

RATING: 7.4
A co-op tower defense game with a lot of variability.  What's unique here is that you never shuffle your deck so it matters what order you discard in and that turn order is random each round.  Also, it's interesting the way the enemy powers can cascade based on what minions it has out and what spells it uses.  Unique player characters really are substantially different.  I look forward to playing this one again!

A wonderful coop deckbuilder with a great emphasis on replayability. Lack of good material and card design was covered by the 2nd edition (better late than never).
Difficulty is also on par and not so unfair.

Good but not great. I would still like to explore the game a little more before deciding if I donate it.

The box size is a little huge, but obviously designed for expansions. If I loved the game then that would be fantastic. As it is, the box is taking up about 10x more space than it needs to.

One of the best co-op deckbuilders I've played, though to be fair I haven't played many.
I love the no-shuffle mechanic, the ease of play, the variety in nemeses, and that every turn gives you lots of choices, instead of automatically playing your hand.
I am less enthused with the sameness of the nemesis deck, and the sameness in the card offer. There aren't as many crazy powers and abilities as I would like.
But I'm sure the new expansions will fix all of that!

Beta tested the game 10+ times with a PnP version.  We had a portion of the cards, nemesis, and mages to play with to test. 

Very good co-op game. It is a deckbuilder with some interesting unique elements.  Variable player order, spells that have to be prepped, and being able to set up combos are just a few of the aspects that set this game apart.  

Cannot wait to get the full game and experience it all.

Nice adaption of Dominion deck building with co-operative monster fighting. The monster has its own deck and bites back which is good. Probably a good basis for a versus version of deck building which cannot be far away.

Turn order, including the monster, is variable which fits nicely into the monster fighting thematic. You do not discard your unused cards at the end of each turn nor do you shuffle your discarded cards when you rebuild your deck -  not sure either of these is necessary but it works fine so all good.

Variable difficulty is a plus. Very good fun.

I was a bit sceptic about it, because everybody said this was really something new and so on.. but, i love coop deckbuilders so i had to back this... and yes, we really really like this game!
The first time i played it by myself i did not know what to think about it, but now i'v played it more it is just a fabulous expreriance. Expasialy now i play it with my gf.. 
2 player this game is smooth as silk. The turn order, not to shuffle your deck, the depth that every single nemesis has.. the way the rounds go, so quick.. we are big fans!
So, for us this is a game at the level of Legendary and Lotr LCG, and that says it all for me! Fantastic!

As committee co-ops go this wasn't bad.

I'm not understanding the buzz on this one. It's not as clean as the incredibly clean deckbuilders (the Realms), nor is it as satisfying as the slightly more elaborate ones (XenoShyft and Shadowrift). The balance seems all over the map, as well, with little consideration of player scaling or different boss effects.
I mean, if you absolutely and completely loathe shuffling, sure...

With apologies to everyone involved with the game, I am going to give my honest thoughts:
If I wanted a soulless, joyless grind, inevitably followed by an early death, I'd move to the USA and become a wage-slave in capitalist-utopia.
Jokes aside, this is almost certainly the least interesting and rote deck-builder I've ever played. It seems to me that every (admirable) attempt at changing up the genre here has fallen terribly flat. Notwithstanding the designer's intentions, all mages play relatively the same and enemies, despite their differences in play, all feel almost exactly the same in progression.
I cannot actually think of a redeeming feature, so I think I'll leave it here.
(PS. My review is probably exacerbated by the fact that I've just recently played a few games of Automobiles, and that game leaves this in its dust...figuraliteralativally.)

A great cooperative deck builder with a few unique mechanics.  The player order deck and lack of shuffling your own deck stand out.

Winnable but not easy.

Thinky deckbuilder. I really like the "no shuffle" aspect, the need for cooperation between players, the feel of pressure to survive, the good feel of getting a new potent spell from the market.
The theme is really gloomy, which is what wears the game down for me. (I can feel pressure without the need for a gloomy feel.) Also, the artistic depiction of humans really isn't to my taste (with faces bearing little-to-no expression, and women really not looking like women for the most part - I don't need exagerated feats, but a woman's got a woman's silhouette and features).
I feel like the game works well with video game addicts, who like to "go at the boss". Not sure for other people.

This one took me a while to commit to because of the art. I'm glad I did because it is a great, tense game with clever game mechanics. The flow of rounds is intuitive and the rules are not too difficult to learn. Set up time is a big minus; you have to sort cards to different decks and that takes a while. Overall, great gameplay, mediocre art and frustrating set up time. Oh, and it's solo! This is a big plus.

Deck builders. Man there are so many of them nowadays, and they were only first introduced to the board gaming hobby in 2008 because of Dominion. But I feel there are more Deck building games now than any other mechanic. I digress, but the plain and simple deck builder of starting with a deck building it and beating your opponent no longer works for me at this point. However, when a game has deck building as "1" of the mechanics in the grand scheme of things, or introduces something wholly different, then you got me.

Aeon's End, I literally bought on the praise of Dice Tower and Rahdo's review. I never followed the game, didn't back on kickstarter or even look at pre-release gameplay footage. Aeon's End reminds me a lot of another Deck builder I really enjoy, Xenoshyft: Onslaught. You and your mates take on the role of a unique breach mage and are tasked with defending Gravehold, the last surviving human city, against a random Nemesis, who's sole purpose is to kill everything in site.

Aeon's End is actually an amalgamation of a few deck building games I really like. It adds the base mechanic from Xenoshyft, where we are protecting a central hub which has a set amount of Hit points, and Legendary Encounters: Alien, where the game has this pseudo-scenario based gameplay, in the the different Nemesis you fight and deck you must deal with to survive. Yes the above sentence is beyond a run-on I know.

But the game has a few nice tricks up its sleeve. One being is that you never shuffle your deck of cards. Once you can no longer draw, you simply flip your entire discard over and draw from the top. This makes it very important how you buy and order your cards in your discard. Also Turn order every round is never set in stone, and is random. Each player gets a go,in two players they will go twice a piece, or in three, one of the players choosing can go again, but the Nemesis will have the chance to go twice as well. Meaning that every round can become more nail-biting than the last as you hope you don't get hit with a back to back nemesis round before players go. 

But, what I like most is how mages interact with the spells they have acquired. Each player starts with 4 breaches and a unique character, that has a very powerful ability that must be charger with Aether(the games currency) before going off, and in these breaches is where they cast their spells. However most onyl start with one open and must work to have more functioning to multi-cast spells on their turn, which also costs aether so tasks you in having to decide whether to have more to cast, or improving your deck. What's great is that spells need not be cast immediately on a player's turn and can stay in your breach till the opportune time. Some even give benefits for being adjacent to other opened breaches or simply prepped.But the nemesis has a slew of bad to combat you at every turn. Each nemesis is unique and brings about their own minions to hinder the heroes or whittle at Gravehold at your dismay. Your spells can target the huge meat shield that is the nemesis, or the scampering minions that are slowing your progress turn after turn. 

The game is fun and challenging, without being over complex and not taking too long per session, about 45-70 minutes. The different card combos and mages add for some unique gameplay and the different Nemesis bosses add variety and replay value to the game

MY main gripe with the game is not even in its gameplay it's the component quality. It's quite cheap. Cards are very flimsy and on thin stock. The artwork is mostly good, but nothing to write home about. The small chits are very generic looking and the cardboard character sheets and bosses are very flimsy. I may overhaul the game with some meeplesource upgrades for the chits and maybe laminating the character sheets so they can last longer. I had to sleeve my cards in thicker/premium sleeves - a mix of Ultra Pro Clears and Dragon Shields - and I recommend the same the minute you purchase the game, because aside from that, the game is great, and I would rate higher but this does hold it back a bit.

UPDATE: So Indie Boards & Cards have released an "updated artwork and component overhaul" expansion to Aeon's End via Kickstarter. Color me suprised, impressed....and a tad ticked off. Not only will this new expansion get a nice artwork, component over haul, but they will be doing it with the First Edition of the game as well. It would irk me more, but thankfully they will have an upgrade pack which is relatively cheap, as long as you show proof of ownership of the game.

Fairly solid co-operative deckbuilder with some very interesting game mechanics in the space. Very similar to Shadowrift, but somehow doesn't end up having the same level of engagement for us. It's a combination of having the town we're protecting represented as a mere counter, and involving less overt coordination between players.

We'll definitely try it out again, but at this point, if we were feeling the co-op deckbuilder itch, we'd certainly play Shadowrift 2nd ed over this one every time.

I liked this. It reminded me in a way of Sentinels of the Multiverse. Maybe that's not a fair comparison, because in this game you're in control of what goes in your deck, and in that game there seems to be more of an opportunity for interesting card effects and combos and the different characters feel more different. But it's the same cooperative core, and seems like it has a similar arc, where things seem dire at first, and there's potentially a turning point where if you can manage to stabilize then winning is relatively easy. I think my biggest criticism is just that the card effects aren't all that interesting and mostly don't really combo off of each other in a way that would make the game particularly interesting or clever. But the way that you just turn your discard pile over to make your deck rather than shuffling means that a careful use of cards and timing of buys and discards is possible, and is something I really enjoy about this one.

RATING: 6
Players work together to defeat a "Nemesis", a powerful beast with unique abilities and whatnot. Players must defeat the nemesis or survive to the end of its draw deck before they are all brought to zero life or their home, which they are defending, is brought to zero health. The base game comes with 4 nemeses and 8 or 9 champions and various "village" cards to purchase. Expansions, I assume, simply add cards to each of these categories. Turn actions generally follow the basic co-operative deckbuilding format (power up, purchase, cast), so let's focus on what's different.

1) You never shuffle your cards. When you need a new draw deck, you simply flip over your discard pile and start drawing. 2) Turn order is randomly drawn each turn. In a four player game, you'd shuffle one turn order card for each player and two nemesis cards into a pile and shuffle it again when you burn through it. 3) Attack spells are readied one turn prior to taking affect. Many cards and actions make use of spells that have been readied but not cast. 4) The Nemesis deck has different forms of attack that can be potentially thwarted in different ways, or have delayed effects. 5) Each character has a powerful ability that needs to be powered up, which gives you a new choice for spending other than acquiring new cards.

Suprisingly, it is the most mundane element - the special player powers - that does more than anything to set this game apart. Once you know your nemesis and your purchase cards, players can strategize their game before beginning and these strategies seem to be largely governed by when and how players are going to use their abilities. If one player is more of a healer and another can cast powerful versions of other character's readied spells, you are going to choose and pace your purchases to support those abilities. Not shuffling is not as impactful as you'd think. With a hand of 5, your ability to manipulate your deck without leveraging special powers is very limited. It mostly means that any card you acquire (and goes on your discard) won't get drawn for a looong time! Random turn order does add some tension, especially when things are down to the wire. 

While the game has some mechanical creativity, these aspects are offset by having a bland theme, mundane objectives, and a lack of card variety (all spells are attack spells, all gems are purchase/power cards). While the card variety will likely improve with expansions, the other aspects will not and that's what keeps this game from feeling all that original. For me, I find Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game to feel more unique and different and for me that is the better co-op deckbuilding title to keep.

Interesting coop deck building game with a fantasy theme. The rules feel a bit daunting, but once you start playing, it's not too bad. A simple flow chart would come in handy. Game was entertaining and we were all engaged. The introductory monster was level 3 and we failed horribly when our town was eventually destroyed. Seems really hard and the rules are far too complex to analyse the solution on the fly. It will require a number of plays just to determine a strategy, let alone pull the strategy off.

Didn't like the game all that much, but the basic idea was interesting - A cooperative deckbuilder with no shuffling. If the designer of the game had more skill/talent/knowledge, I think this could have been a pretty solid game.

As it is... The designers WAY over-committed. It's their first game, the art is like, early-90's bad; it looks like some of the art from the early sets of MTG, but not the good cards. 

Then, the publisher likely realized how little the game was actually going to do once people got their hands on it outside of kickstarter, so they tried cutting costs by not using a pledge manager, so the whole thing was terribly mismanaged, rewards coming out sporadically, many people not getting rewards, and canceled/refunded pledges everywhere.

Not people worth supporting, and not a game worth spending the 4 hours it takes to set up, play, and pack back up. There are dozens of better deckbuilders for your time and money.

Újabb versenyző a deckbuilding koopok világában. Sok jó ötletet tartalmaz, mechanikailag vannak benne érdekes dolgok, tematikailag azonban nem túl izgalmas, és számomra az illusztrációk sem kiemelkedőek. A random játékos/Nemesis sorrend elsőre jópofa, de eléggé megnehezíti a tervezést, gyakorlatilag ha egymás után kijön a két Nemesis, semmit sem tehetünk, elszenvedjük egymás után a sok negatív hatást. A varázslatok helyeinek felszabadítása jópofa ötlet, de elég felesleges macerának tűnik, valahogy pont a deckbuildingekre jellemző "egyszerű, de nagyszerű" jelleg tűnik el. Ha újra előkerülne, nem menekülnék el, de valószínűtlen, hogy én kérném, szamomra a Legendary Alien deckbuilding sokkal nagyobb élmény volt, ha már koop pakliépítésről van szó.

First, the components are abysmal. The gameplay itself is not bad, although the characters feel a bit generic. The flipping over your deck thing is okay, but I found it to be a bit of a gimmick rather then something I could truly exploit. 

I wouldn't play with more then 3 players, as it could be a long time between your turns. Two players is probably best.

I am in love with the concept of this game. I thoroughly enjoyed playing the demo version. However, when I grabbed the game from the BGGCon library to show my friends, the game didn't play as well. I suspect since I played with the demo version and only have limited insight into the multitude of other wizards/sorcerers that ultimately I would really enjoy this game.

Bought this game based on the praise it is receiving. My group really enjoys Dominion so seeing similar mechanics used here with a very engaging theme and straight to the point gameplay (no points, just win or lose), I picked it up. 

The flexibility you have to use your Aether (money) on your turn makes the decisions very intriguing. Each mage feels different and I love how their unique card ties in with their Ability. The very streamlined way of playing out the Nemesis turn is an excellent, well-thought design.

The main complaints I have are that the spell cards feel very very similar to each other. I suppose this is a byproduct of the limitation that having streamlined rules puts on the game. I also wished Gravehold was more than just a numbers dial. 

This is one of very few games I have had my girlfriend extremely engaged in. I do recommend it.

This game combines my two favourite aspects of boardgaming, Coop and deck building, and it does not dissapoint. You really do get a feeling of working together and the turn order deck causes alot of exciting and tense moments, and not shuffling your deck removes some of the randomness of traditional deck builders. Also a very good variety included in the base box, but I am still excited for future expansions. This game for me raised the bar for games in general.

Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.

In a recent thread here, someone asked for peoples' favorite deckbuilders and this one was mentioned often. I had never heard of it and was curious to try it.

AE does a lot of different things from other deckbuilders. First, it's cooperative. You're joined together to defeat a single bad guy. Second, you don't shuffle. When your deck runs out, you just flip over your discard pile. Third, turn order fluctuates. With three players there is a card for each, plus a WILD card (players get to decide who gets that turn) and two NEMESIS cards where the bad guy goes. Each round this deck is shuffled.

Those differences do stand out, and provide a unique experience. Though the setting is bog-standard fantasy, it's all sorcery, no swords, so you don't have to futz around with the usual weapons and enemies. It doesn't feel like the usual fantasy stuff, and it also doesn't trudge through the current already-tired trend of dark fantasy. 

It's a good fun game, and I'm glad to now be aware of it.

Initial Impressions: The rating might go up to a 7 if there are more interesting comboes in the non-starter setup. While it has some cool individual cards the way they interacted with each other felt like something I've seen many times before. 

The changing turn order, not discarding your hand at the end of your turn, and not shuffling your discard pile takes quite a bit getting used to. Once you do the turn order adds some luck but also some tactics as you have to adapt to threats differently based on it. Meanwhile the no shuffling adds strategy but I fear for an AP-prone or min-max to the detriment of flow of play player might slow the game down dramatically.

As always I like assymetry in games.

The way threats work and needing to prep spells and your special abilities are cool, but the nemesis phase just somehow lacks the in your face feel that other co-ops have that creates tension. I think it is because the effects feel too hodge podge, rather than say one monster latching onto one player, or a large creature or threat looming over your village to send you in panic attack that you need to deal with it or it is a surefire loss. There is some of that here in the Power effects, but the way to disable them feel pretty anticlimatic.

As always I prefer deckbuilders with static markets over dynamic ones.

Rating could go up with more plays. I'd put this one on hold after a couple of plays until I could get the update pack. Overall, AE is a great solo/co-op deck builder with well-designed boss monster mechanics. Note: I've only played it two-handed solo. The build-up and ending of each play so far has been exciting and a lot of fun. The rulebook itself leaves a lot to be desired in explaining the voids in a meaningful way but it's still a great game once you get your head around it.

A KS Quinns from Shut Up & Sit Down mentioned - it's a cooperative deckbuilder you play against an AI Nemesis. So...Sentinals of the Multiverse combined with Thunderstone. Most novel thing is you don't shuffle your discard pile, but just flip it over and keep going - so order matters.
Eh?
He says it falls flat a bit, but I'm also still interested. At least if I'd find it at a nice price or a trade.

I wanted to like this but in the end was disappointed with most aspects of the game. The player interaction as incidental at best and I never felt any incentive to assist my team. similarly, protecting the town seemed completely detached from what I was doing on my turn. Ultimately, it felt like a mediocre deck builder.

RATING: 6
[Played more than 100 times]

A deckbuilder with a few well implemented twists (cooperative, no reshuffling and you may keep cards between turns as in most traditional card games, allowing an overall finer impact on strategy, but giving up a whole category of effects. It also tends to limit replay value as you go for consolidated "combos" that become guaranteed).
Decent variety (cards, characters, enemies, etc.), albeit not so accentuated as in other deckbuilders.
Some odd design choices (e.g. you do not shuffle your decks, but constantly need to shuffle the Turn Order cards; or the option to win by surviving the whole enemy deck rather than killing the boss possibly leading to odd "turtling" strategie; the mage whose speacial ability is useless - in fact, detrimental - unless you are going for such strategy; etc.).

Really nice deck building game, completly replaces Sentinals of the Multiverse for me, have played normal level against the 7 bosses (inc expansions) which are varied. Looking forward to playing at the harder levels 2 player and then having a go with 4 players, plays very well. 

Like the random play order, variable gems that are used, as well as having no shuffling and more control over that side of things.

Could do with more dynamic art on the player boards, having tighter life dials and a fluff book to get the theme over, but these are all small things, very glad I backed this, looking forward to an expansion later next year.

I enjoy the character selection/pairing strategy and deck grooming. With all of the expansions/randomizers there are a lot of options and reply value. I find myself winning just in the nick of time or losing last minute. I would complain that the player boards and card stock/finishing quality could be better. Plan to sleeve the cards but this makes storage an issue. Would prefer if the player boards and more importantly the breaches fit into some form of an anti-knock insert to keep things clean, smooth and not getting bumped around the table.

I don't know where this will land yet for a rating. I find I really miss shuffling my deck, even though not shuffling is an interesting twist that gives more control.

What I really like about this game is the amount of variety that there will be from game to game between all the different heroes, all the unique adversaries, and the vast combinations of cards.

Unfortunately, this one will probably end up being played solo since my husband declared, "The only thing I like about it is the theme."

The component quality wasn't great and they didn't even provide enough dividers which is a big no-no for a deckbuilding game.

The game felt like a roller coaster ride where your actions are completely meaningless.  Like most co-op games, your skills don't matter since everything is reliant on the "deck of bad things" that has become a boring trope at this point in board games.  The deckbuilding itself is rather lackluster since you don't have any real engine building going on.  You just want to get stronger spells and open up breaches to "slot" more spells in.  Unlike other deckbuilders like Dominion or Draconis Invasion, there is no "engine building" and your only meaningful decision is what to buy, not how you play your hand.

This is easily my wife and my favorite game.  It tweaks the mechanics of games like dominion market and deck building into a cooperative game play that makes sense!  My only drawbacks are packaging, but I've rarely come across a game that has great storage options.  The art is pretty good, some feel that it is outdated, but I really don't mind it.  Back to the good stuff...  The 2 player, 3 player, and 4 player game modes are all balanced and enjoyable.  It is easy to forget that the turn order is not circular, but variable for each round.  Each nemesis requires thought and cannot necessarily be played the same way again.  I've played this game probably 20 times and still get excited when we go to a game night and stay in and play.  Very excited for the AE:WE+ Void expansion to come out, they'll be in the front of the collection for a long time to come!

Got in a couple of playthroughs this weekend as a 2 player game.

The only real negative is that the card stock is kind of a bad quality.  Definitely a game you want to sleeve up.

Fun and very challenging game with lots of depth. The cooperative element is sturdy and feels important, what small decision you make can have an impact later down the line (or your deck in this case).
It's a refreshing take on deck building as well as build order game. The fun comes from making a well built and optimized, but also well earned deck if you manage to do so at all. The game offers a lot replay value in the form of variety in bosses, card setup as well as character abilities. That being said, the game itself falls short in build quality and card organization.

Co-op deck-builder. Sort of Shadowrun: Crossfire meets Sentinels of the Multiverse. Feels different from most deck-builders in that there's little shuffling. It was a bit easy, though. Maybe some of the other nemeses are tougher. Production values are so-so (Kickstarter), and the cards are somewhat generic, but the mechanics are unique.

This is a stellar game. I've been buying board game after board game for the past year, looking for one that would give me the same sense of satisfaction I got from playing online games for many years. I found it in this game (which probably has something to do with the designer being a retired professional Starcraft player).

I think a lot of it has to do with the suspense it's able to create and maintain throughout the game. It really does keep you wondering about what's going to happen next, round after round. Not only is the game incredibly fun, but it also plays so smoothly and has such a simple rule set for how deep it is; I don't feel mentally burdened as I do with other board games.

Apparently, this game has been playtested over 400 times. It certainly shows.

After playing this game more, my opinion of it has grown worse rather than better, and I think I'm done with it at this point. First of all, the game is downright difficult. Now, I've only played solo with 4 mages, so maybe this has just been my experience, but I feel like it's nearly impossible to get everything accomplished on your turns that you want to get done. Also, the games feel really static from one another, even when using different boss monsters. Yeah, they all have a different specialty, but due to the fact that 90% of the boss's cards are the same from game to game and the decks are so meticulously set up, it doesn't really have as much variance from game to game as you'd expect. Even the cards you buy aren't that different from each other, except for the relics, which aren't really useful enough to invest in on their own. It almost seems like you have to go heavy into spells, no matter what, because if you go with a "big money" strategy, you won't be able to have it pay off before the enemy really ramps up.

It sounds like I'm complaining about this game being too hard, but really I'm not. I just simply don't think it's that great of a design. Deck builders are supposed to be fun, and it really feels like they tried to strip the mechanism of all its luck, which makes it far more soulless than your typical deck builder. The so-called unique mechanisms of not shuffling your deck and utilizing spell breaches are more cumbersome than anything else (Not to mention not really being unique), and certain characters are just plain better than others due to their inherent abilities (Adelheim, anyone?). Plus I have Sentinels of the Multiverse, which has a similar situation of a bunch of heroes trying to take down the big bad guy, and I feel like the gameplay of Sentinels is far more interesting than Aeon's End. I'm still discovering new combos in that game, 100+ plays later, but I already feel like I've seen all the depth Aeon's End has to offer.

At the end of the day, I think Aeon's End is a decent game, but nowhere near good. I hate to say it, but Action Phase Games haven't been winning me over with their recent designs, so unless an expansion for Heroes Wanted is in the works, I think I'm ready to be done with their games. They are quirky, to be sure, but quirky doesn't always equal greatness. Aeon's End is certainly a good example of that. I think Euro gamers who typically dislike deck builders and prefer their games with as little luck as possible will probably enjoy this game. As for me, I think there are far better deck builders on the market. This game has a great deal of something I hate, which is the illusion of choice. The game railroads you to do certain things, or else you'll end up losing. Because of this and all the other things I've mentioned, I can't say Aeon's End is something worth recommending.

Enjoyable deck building game that take the deck building mechanisms found in City of Iron and expands it out to a larger deck building experience.  The theme is more or less generic, but the execution plays out well.  The game is hard, but does not get overboard and you have several ways to win which should keep this game from feeling stale for a good while.

This is my new favorite deckbuilder. Easy to learn and teach, plays very smoothly both solo and co-op, but seems incredibly well-balanced - in all the games I've played past the introductory ones, they've all come down to one tense final round where we could've won or lost. Comes with multiple nemeses that all play very differently, and with all the expansions there is a ton of content for replayability. My family really enjoys it as well.

One (successful!) game on the first boss doesn't seem to be enough to judge Aeon's End, but this seemed like a well-designed co-op deckbuilder to me. The only obvious drawback, which exists in many co-ops, is that it seems like a run of bad draws can quickly put the team in an unwinnable state.

Easily one of the best cooperative deckbuilders I have ever played.  It requires real teamwork and planning without devolving to an "alpha player" game.  There is a lot of replayability right out of the box but I would definitely get any and all expansions that would be released, even if they only contained extra characters or nemeses.  Action Phase games is on a real hot streak right now!

Very cool game and take on the deckbuilding. Has somekinda similar threads to Sentinels of the Multiverse, as everyone is versus one big bad guy... play has similar feel a bit. Why not higher rating? Strange to say, but for some reason it doesn't feel like a full polished product. Compared to current standards for deckbuilders or boardgames in general something feels off and I can't put my finger exactly what. Will update after a few more plays and it might get up a bit more, as I really like the mechanisms and the gameplay.

Pure co-op fantasy deckbuilder. KS 2016-04. 

It's a Dominion-style deckbuilder (but with multiple buys), with 2 main twists: Turn order is random, like Tiny Epic Defenders, and instead of shuffling your discard pile, you just flip it over.

Decent fantasy co-op deckbuilder with many different villains, heroes, and abilities.  Its replay seemed endless and had a strong challenge.  I liked the random turn order as well.

Love this game! #1 game that I own. 
*The theme is perfect, an entire world is elucidated in the flavor texts of cards and character mats
*nemeses are unique and challenging, with 3 tiers increasing in difficulty as the game progresses. Each nemeses will have their own individual nemesis cards (9 typically) but the large portion of every nemesis deck is made up of basic nemesis cards which you encounter over and over and stagnates quickly, especially the # of times I've played
*the spells, relics, and gems provide enough variety without being too convoluted.
*Breaches, genius application of spells. You must prep a spell to an open/focused breach and the subsequent turn it will cast. Relics provide instantaneous benefits. Gems are the real strategic cards, the aether they provide can be used to focus/open breaches, charge abilities of your mage, acquire cards from the market, or prevent a nemesis power from activating. A lot of tough decisions are made giving the right amount of tension.
*Mage abilities, these are the weakest part of the game, while they certainly all provide variety and uniqueness, every game essentially requires two mages, one that heals players and one that heals your home. Not enough spells/relics/gems that provide significant assistance in that department (least of which on Increased difficulty).
*My favorite part (which I've never seen in any game I've played) variable turn order. You might have the perfect plan but have it spoiled by the nemesis attacking before your turn.

Get this game!

Really great time playing this.  Nice mix of standard central market deck building with a similar boss mechanic as Sentinels of the Multiverse.  Even so, not very fiddly.  Though I know that the differentiating mechanic is the placing your discards in order of choice, as opposed to shuffling, I am personally not convinced its superior.  One of the attractive points of deck builders for me is the constant shuffling, and I found it hard to build a strategy around the ordered placement.  Overall a very solid game and though we lost miserably I am looking forward to playing again.

Not a fan of neither deckbuilding nor co-ops.

That said, making a deckbuilding game into a co-op makes it much easier to play for newbies as experienced players can help them along without compromising anyone's game.

Really like that players don't shuffle their discards, so you can stack your own deck.

Game length too long for what it is. But I have that issue for all deck builders as the early game is typically boring and limited.

Well crafted, balanced, yet wonderfully challenging game. Sure, it feels like we've treaed similar ground with many previous games. The theme isn't terribly inspiring, but a few unique twists and a clean, colorful art style help this stand out. The breach/casting system is perhaps the most noteworthy, and it is used to great effect to make every spell seem immensely important. Every single point of damage dealt is meaningful, and players will have negotiate and coordinate constantly if they want to stand any chance, even against the beginner boss. 

My biggest complaint might be that there aren't enough basic cards, so even though each boss comes with some unique cards, every monster deck will repeat a lot of encounters. Luckily, this game requires so much planning that having intimate knowledge of the monster deck potential is a strategic advantage, even if the replay value suffers a bit for it.

This game has been a huge hit for my friends and family.  There are several games that fit a similar genre - coop, fight boss, save location, build deck.  This one does it better than any I've played.

The bosses are so unique in their style, which forces you to vary your strategy based on the boss you are fighting.  So different!

I enjoy deck building and this is a classic deck builder except you don't shuffle your discard pile - just flip it over.  It's so efficient that way, and you get to use that as a strategic advantage because you know what's coming (and in what order).

Two games in and man...I'm having a blast. You know what my favorite thing about this crazy game is? Not shuffling your deck. I'm lazy so that appeals to me anyway, but it changes the entire dynamic of building a deck. Such a simple change but one that really makes a difference!

A co-operative deck builder meets a fantasy battler. To me, it feels like Dominion but with a purpose. Instead of just trying to build up points - you build up your hand with abilities and currency, so you can fight against the boss that is threatening the town of Gravehold. 
It has an interesting death mechanic, where the player isn't out - other players will take damage for him. Like most co-ops, either everyone wins or no-one does. 
In the box, there's a lot of variety. Between different bosses to fight, different heroes to play and the multitude of different gems/relics/spells that will make up the market you can buy from - there's a lot of combinations that will produce a lot of different game experiences with each replay.
If you've played a deckbuilder before, it's relatively easy to understand the turn structure and play the game - but it's not an easy game. Myself and my gf lost our first 4 games before, finally, getting a victory - this game is a bit of a challenge. But that makes it all the better when you finally do get a victory!
I'm quite happy we picked this one up on KS, and looking forward to the "expansion" (War Eternal) on Kickstarter when it arrives too.

The one thing I really hate about the deckbuilding mechanic is the constant shuffling... so a fantasy cooperative deckbuilder where your discards are just flipped over to form the new draw deck instead of being shuffled... well, it's very much right in my sweet spot. Furthermore, the cards are very well designed to have interesting interactions with each other. Extremely high replayability.

RATING: 6
This is a decent cooperative "boss-battling" experience that offers solid deck-building gameplay in a short duration. There are a few noteworthy points of clever design by Kevin Riley: 1) Prepping spells to be cast at your will lets you set up incrementally strong turns, 2) Disallowing deck-shuffling adds another dimension of memory to layer onto your strategy in deciding the order in which you discard your cards. Sure, the theme is generic, but the game itself does nothing glaringly wrong. Good fun.

(+) Interlocking character ability mechanisms provide interesting decisions for players and reward long-term planning and teamwork. Played well, a team functions as if it is a single entity with multiple synergies. 
(+) Numerous deck thinning opportunities that contribute to player agency for executing a strategy.
(+) Immense replayability. Variable starting market, and a slew of boss/character matchup combinations. Not unlike a favorite of mine (BattleCON), but alas, this one is cooperative.

(-) A generic-themed, cooperative puzzle solver at heart.
(-) Components could use some love, but they are functional.
(-) Gameplay sort of just meanders along. Flip over the monster deck and figure out how to deal with the next bad thing, time and again. It was not overly engaging.

Tough, clever, but ponderous and regimented cooperative deck builder with some very smart boss design and tightly integrated mechanisms. Overall, this game is a little too slow paced for my taste (it just seems to move in slow motion), and the variable turn order means you can potentially have a lot of downtime between turns. I really like several elements of this game, though. The delayed spell casting and the lack of shuffling are both major pluses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game makes a big deal about how you don't shuffle your deck, then makes you shuffle the turn and strike decks with great frequency.  By not shuffling you reduce randomness, which is overpowered by the immense randomness from other sources (like the villain sometimes taking 4 turns in a row).  The fixed draw also creates a memorization and puzzle element that is boring, annoying, but sometimes relevant.

I do like how the game offers a lot of tactical choices about what to do with your money each turn, and I like how the 'breach slots' throttle spells and can be opened incrementally.

The cards are pretty boring -- the ones you buy, the heroes, and the villains.  Trashing is, as always, a necessity and a boring chore.  Setup is pretty fiddly.

Aside from the villain-action-chaining-luck and general annoyance, the turn order deck does reduce over-planning while still ensuring that player take equal turns.

Mostly, the game is just a slog of slowly damaging the villain, while nothing interesting happens.

Excellent co-op board game. It has a lot of replayability - different bosses, cards, and characters mean that each new game is a new puzzle to solve. The randomness that comes with turn order and boss cards makes things interesting, and can create some tense situations near the end of the game.

The adjustable difficulty is really important. Since it's a fully coop experience, playing at the wrong difficulty can make a game too easy, taking away the tension. We found that most games tend to be just close enough near the end that it gets interesting, but not so impossible that we lost.

Solid, simple deck builder. Play is brisk and fluid. Players have multiple good options on any given turn, not so many that play bogs down, but sufficient enough to reward skill over luck. The game invokes ego investment and information processing just enough to prevent alpha gaming. The no shuffle rule accomplishes a lot in the game, preventing tedious shuffling, yes, but also keeping information expertise central to each player. Nicely interactive.

My favorite cooperative game this far.

I have wanted to play Aeon’s End again ever since playing it the first and only time.  It is a really compelling game that feels familiar, but is different enough to be a captivating game.  Most deckbuilding games feel like solitary experiences to the point that I pretty much only enjoy Friday (which is a solo only game) when it comes to pure deckbuilding.  However, the cooperative nature and several other features/mechanisms of Aeon’s End finally changes that for me.  While the theme of the game could be better, working together as a team to strategize is a lot of fun.  Couple that with the random turn order and unexpected attacks from the bad guy and the game becomes immersive and fun for the entire team.  Players need to stay engaged at all times, not just on their own turns.  I’ve only been able to scratch the surface of Aeon’s End so far and doing so has left me excited to explore what awaits inside the box.  I am really looking forward to playing the game more to discover how the gameplay feels different and changes when playing with different people and against different monsters.

I am not very fond of co-ops. There are a few exceptions, like mice and mystics for example. Aeon's end is the best co-op we have. This game is really really good. Love to play it. You can choose the difficulty level, rules are simple and the game plays within 1 hour.

While this game is inspired by and learns from previous deck-builders, it is both innovative and fresh. The design is incredibly tight, deploying traditional mechanisms and building on them (ie there are a number of interesting twists such as no shuffling, delayed actions through breaches, and variable turn order). Together, these somewhat more incremental changes produce a game that is far greater than the sum of its parts. In contrast to somewhat less tight designs, the pacing and balance are excellent! The designer is also supporting the game with new content that continues to push the boundaries of deck-building (I can't wait for the hinted at campaign expansion).

And, while the art and graphic design have been criticized, I consider the art to be very nice and thematically embedded. After all, this is a very bleak world.

I should also add that the game is refreshing in its treatment of the role of women. There's a lot of care that has gone into supporting this throughout (flavour text, artwork, etc).

That said, I'm not all praise. There are some fairly minor but disappointing component issues. First, the dials are incredibly loose, which makes tracking life difficult and error prone (I've since added washers to the dials and they work fine now). Second, the mats are glossy and difficult to read under most lighting conditions. Third, and most importantly, the breaches are paper thin and have pointed edges, which makes them readily catch on any material.

I hope that they come out with an upgrade pack and adjust this in future editions as the game is quite excellent (easily an 8.75-9 without the subpar components)

A fun well designed coop. It's got a nice build to the excitement. You start out weakish mages zapping little 1 pt bolts and then manage your deck to create some baddass mages flinging big whomps of energy. Of course, while you're building up, so is the big bad boss, getting stronger, hurting you, hurting the town you're supposed to defend. It's a race between whether you or it wins the game. One review called it a mash-up between Dominion and Sentinels of the Multiverse but without the fiddlyness, which seems pretty spot-on. I like Sentinels but I think this will get played more because of its smoother design.

The look of the thing is decent. Good quality cards and such.  The art looks good but not fantastic. The backstory, the theme, is ok but could be fleshed out better. All that, I think, will keep it from going higher than an 8. But maybe I'm wrong. I haven't explored all the bosses and players yet.  So far I've played it solitaire and 2 player, and it worked well at those counts. I'd love to play with 3 or 4.

RATING: 7
Clever co-op deckbuilder which enlivens the formula ith a few excellent twists. It's Dominion-style (there are always a set number of different cards available, rather than an Ascension-style queue of unique cards), but there's no shuffling (just flip the discard pile over). It's hard to overstate the difference this makes: there are interesting strategic options around timing and deck manipulation that just aren't possible in similar games with more shuffling. Additionally, spells take one turn to prep and one to cast; some spells grant additional abilities while prepped, but take up players' scarce slots. This delay can also be used to move spells around the deck, and some abilities allow players to cast others' prepped spells. It all adds a lot to the strategy.

While players do get more deck control, turn order is randomized (generally speaking, two cards for each player are shuffled together, then drawn one by one, so it's possible for a player -- or the nemesis AI -- to get up to four turns in a row). The nemesis itself is managed by a deck of cards comprising either permanent threats or one-off strikes. Different nemeses play [i]very[/i] differently and each introduce their own unique rules twists. Even here in just the base game the system is pushed much further than in most deckbuilders; one, for example, eats cards from the purchase piles (!).

Players win if they kill the nemesis before it kills them and their stronghold. It's unfortunate that the theme is so generic because the gameplay is a million miles ahead of, say, Legendary Encounters. The turn order and nemesis decks can be very volatile indeed, though. I like the excitement of the turn order changes but the nemesis randomness can seem capricious. That said, it's a great system, and easily the best co-op deckbuilder I have played.

As a solitaire game it also compares quite well to something like Hostage Negotiator (which also pushes its system hard with different abductors). The true solo mode is impossibly difficult, however, and it's too fiddly to play two-handed.

As a big fan of [thing=129437][/thing] and [thing=199042][/thing], Aeon's End appealed to me as another cooperative deck builder.  Here are the things that distinguish it from these other similar games:
:star: Breaches for casting spells, so you prepare a spell on one turn and cast it on you next turn.
:star: No deck shuffling, so you get to choose the order of discards and setup combos.
:star: Variable turn order, determined with a turn order deck, so you never know who is going next.
:star: Very unique enemies that make each game completely different.
:halfstar: Fairly generic fantasy theme and art.
:halfstar: The pacing ramps up a little bit, but not as much as I would like.  It lies between Legendary (basically no ramping, just starts fast) and Harry Potter (excellent ramping that starts slow and accelerates)
:nostar: Basically only a 2 player game.  4 people is too many for pretty much any deckbuilder.  The 3 player game is strange because the turn order deck has 1 card for each player, then a wild card where the players choose who goes.  I found this to be extremely awkward because we pretty always want to take the turn ourselves, but nobody wants to be selfish and say they want to go.  The best strategic option would be to always have the dame person take an extra turn, since power in deckbuilders is exponential.
:nostar: In our game, we got one card early on that basically doomed us.  If we had drawn it near the end, it would have done nothing.  So, I'm worried the AI decks have too much variability.

Overall, I like a lot of the things they did differently.  But, I'm a little worried that the game is too generic and basically only a 2 player game for me.  Definitely want to play again, but it's only going to be my 3rd favorite cooperative deckbuilder, at best.

Speaking as someone who normally doesn't enjoy "pure" deck-builders or cooperative games, Aeon's End is just so groovy. Big boss monsters, lots of options each turn, tricky situations that you can sidestep with some clever thinking... this has provided some of the best cooperative experiences I've had in a game that wasn't real-time. Hopefully this End will be the beginning of an expanding system.

RATING: 8
This does have a very similar feel to Sentinels of the Multiverse but with a number of welcomed changes. While I'm a big fan of SotM, here are some of the differences and similarities:

First is the fiddliness. In SotM you have tokens and modifiers all over the place. This card boosts that card, and that card grants this bonus, and this ability changes that, and you need to keep up with all of it at all times. Aeon's End seems to do away with all of that in favor of more straightforward abilities. Here, most effects will just do a fixed amount of damage and sometimes they'll have a built-in way to increase or decrease that damage. It works really well.

Besides the fiddliness of the components, Aeon's End also cleaned up the fiddliness of the round structure. In SotM you have start of turn abilties, main phase actions, and end of turn abilities. Every turn, heroes and villains (and environment) alike, you have to look at all of the cards for their timing triggers, draw a new card, then check timing triggers again. Aeon's End has a much simpler hero turn, and the villain turn is much more streamlined. You just see if any of the villain's cards have a persistent effect (usually just doing a certain amount of damage), then you draw a new villain card. This all keeps the game much more simple and keeps it moving along without having to backtrack for effects that you overlooked.

Then there's the wild difficulty variance. In SotM you could have a really hard or easy time depending on which villain you're fighting and which heroes you're using. Sometimes after just a few turns you can see that there's no way you can win based on your setup. In Aeon's End the heroes are all very similar. Each one has a unique card, and each one has a special ability that they can use after spending time to charge it up. Otherwise they function the same and use cards fromt he same market. This creates a much more consistent experience while still giving you some difference between the heroes.

There are a couple of things that could be better with Aeon's End:

The components aren't great. The dials are incredibly loose, several of the tokens seem too small, the breach markers are just [i]slightly[/i] thicker than regular paper, and the cards just don't feel very good. Even the box feels a lot thinner and cheaper than your standard modern board game box. It's also a little worrisome that Indie Board and Cards produces this game, because they have some of the worst printing quality in the business so I'm not sure how these cards will hold up.

I'm also not seeing the benefit to just flipping over your deck instead of shuffling it. One thing I love about deckbuilders is drawing an awesome hand of cards after working toward setting up a sweet combo, but here you mostly draw the same hands of cards over and over. There are little things you can do to try to setup a good combo, like leaving a card on an open breach or holding onto a card (you keep any cards that are left in your hand for the next turn), but it doesn't seem to add much strategic depth on top of all of the other things that are going on.

Really enjoying the game so far despite the minor issues.

Co-op deck-building distilled down to an efficient bare-bones machine. Plays much more smoothly than Sentinels of the Multiverse (which it was obviously inspired by) and offers lots of interesting choices.

I played this game in the beta multiple times and each time it felt like a different game.  Due to the randomization of the turn order deck, as well as the nemesis deck, it's hard to find a guaranteed opening that you expect to work every time.  Adaptability and teamwork are key if you want to save Gravehold and defeat the Nameless.

I backed Aeon's End War Eternal and after playing that I ordered everything else I could find! Awesome system and totally replaced Sentinels of the Multiverse for me or rather I should say it is the game I wish Sentinels had been (no modifier overload).

I love the streamlined and straightforward mechanics, the different Nemeses decks and effects, and the variable turn order. I have the second edition and the art is pretty good for the most part and totally awesome as far as character diversity and lack of chainmail bikinis are concerned! 

The only downside is I would have liked thicker character and nemesis boards.

Oct 2017: Rating lowered to 4.  This game falls really flat after a play or two.  If you don't use the easy rules, it is extremely difficult and punishing and ends up feeling more like a luck-based game.  Turns out we may like "Euro" games more than "Ameritrash", and this ends up feeling much more like the latter.

Original:
Fun game!  Plays well with 3p but equally well with 2p or solo.  Challenging but can scale a little with various beginner/expert settings.  A really nice improvement upon the "standard" deckbuilder where your deck serves a greater purpose.  I would prefer cards with a linen finish and the dividers for cards are pretty thin, but that's only a small complaint.  Box organization could also be improved, as there is no spot that easily fits the hero/nemesis cards.

This has been one of the best designed mechanic games I have ever played. It's original with the breach system and it adds a feel of urgency and making the right decisions with how you manage your currency (aether) because if you make a bad purchase it can bit you really quick. Since turns are limited in a three to four player game every single choice you make will impact the game and for that reason alone there is never a moment to just zone out and not be engaged with the game. For that and it's originality I give this game 9 stars. Well done guys.

I like the game mechanics, and I appreciate that it includes solo rules. I hope to play it more. My main problem is with components. For one thing, the insert is terrible and doesn't even fit the player boards/nemesis boards. I had to toss it. Second, the player boards are too small; it drives me nuts the way the breach tokens hang off the edges. This factor in particular reduces my desire to play. Edit: I suspect that if I ever do get around to repeated plays, my rating will probably go up.

Fantasy coop deck builder. Several and varied baddies to go up against. Prepare spells drawing power from the open breach or focusing aether. Open the four breaches on your magic shelf to cast more spells each turn. Prepared spells are cast the next round. Aether can also be used to power up variable player super spells. Unlike the genre, exhausted decks are not reshuffled. Played hands are instead arranged when discarded in the way you want them to come in following rounds. Each round the baddie draws a nemesis card to corrupt player decks, summon minions, and sling damage. Game ends when the nemesis takes lethal damage or the town Gravehold is destroyed. The prepare before casting adds a nice tactics twist from the timing delay forecasting the nemesis and other players next turn actions. I also like the random turn order cards.

I really love Deckbuilder games, and Aeon's end amps up the play with it's unique system of not shuffling your deck. It makes the game more tactical, as you try and determine which order to discard your cards in hopes that they will appear together to combo. The game is not easy, it's challenging, and keeps the tension up.

It's unpleasant when the nemesis randomly attacks twice in a row.  Respectable fun otherwise, even if unshuffled cards are the precursor to the devil's apocalypse.

When I try again, I will continue to play quickly and not care about winning - no offense to the owner or designer.  I'd just rather have the game end sooner than later. Though a full game with a win wouldn't pain me excessively.

A co-op deck building game. Very challenging monsters. You need to coordinate decks between players (not easy to do)so that each player can share in the battles and be effective. It is a puzzle to solve. Great if you like this sort of game.

Quite a good game, some clever mechanics like the discard-pile flipping and the spellslots.

However I already have Shadowrift and Mistfall, both I do like better than this one.
On the other hand this is easier to get into, so if that is one of your criteria you could do worse than buy/play this :)

My favorite co-op deckbuilder yet! No-shuffle deckbuilding (no luck of the draw in your deck!) is a neat twist, and the random turn order between players and nemesis is clever and suspenseful. Plus, it plays in 75 mins or less - perfect for a weeknight game!

This is a really neat deckbuilder. The monsters you fight each have unique abilities. Each mage feels just a little different due to the starting hand and the charge ability. It's very easy to teach to anyone familiar with deckbuilders. There is some luck involved as far as the turn order draw goes, which I think is a great way to add tension to the game.

My final judgment on this game is still ways off, but for now I'm very keen to play it again, and that soon. Deck building without shuffling your deck is a unique, and fun concept. The theme of protecting an underground town is also quite nice.

Completed all nemesis on normal difficulty; the game is a retail version.

Sleeved as well.

I'll never be a big fan of deck builders and am not one to seek out cooperative games... but I still quite enjoyed Aeon's End.  The flip your deck instead of shuffle mechanic was pretty wonderful for setting up some great turns to lend more long term planning to deck building over random chance and I found the way the threats from the village ramped up to increase difficulty over time to be almost as good as Pandemic's smart deck too.  Still not something I feel compelled to buy... but a game I would not turn down if offered.

A neat deck building game that feels like a fantasy version of Sentinels of the Multiverse. Good game

Not much new here, but done very well,  I found this game fairly addictive and more interesting than Thunderstone.

This is a pretty smart cooperative deck-building game! I like the switch from shuffled player decks to the variable turn order; it makes you feel like you have control of your abilities, yet there's tension from needing to contend with unexpected threats. 

There is a lot of variability, at least with the included expansions (The Depths and The Nameless), so I'm not guessing replayability to ever be a problem. You can switch up the Breach Mages (player characters) that you use, the nemesis that you face, the market...

Discussion and interaction with your allies is great, too, though I don't have to deal with an alpha gamer in the group... Solo play is also quite doable, although I've only played solo piloting two breach mages.

This may creep up to a 10!

Kellemes meglepetés volt ez a számomra semmiből jött játék. Tetszett az első alkalom vele, szívesen veszem, ha majd még előkerül. Jó a kicsit megcsavart deckbuilding rész, jók a képességek, érdekesek a szörnyek és kellően nehéz is a dolog, de azért nem lehetetlen. Az újrajátszhatóság garantált, csak a fél órás setupot kell vhogy túlélni.

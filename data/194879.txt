RATING: 8
Boy do I love this game. I haven't had a game land so successfully in a while. Not Alone's premise is simple, but the cat-and-mouse mechanic is genius, and makes for a really fun medium-weight game. 

This game handles 2-7 players very easily and doesn't overstay its welcome. It's fun to be the Beast and it's equally fun to cool down from playing the beast with a round as a survivor. This takes the tension of hidden roles games, makes the roles public, and frontloads all of that tension into the thought over which location to go to. 

Very good, very snappy game -- definitely worth it!

I enjoyed playing hide and seek again, but the interactions didn't feel as enjoyable as other games and the mechanics felt a bit loose.

Playing as the Creature, I felt it difficult to track all of the habits/past choices of 3 players, and ended up targeting one player and then a "good" location or two.  It felt a bit too random, and even though the end score was close, the gameplay didn't meet my expectations.

I ended up trading this away, even though I hadn't played it multiple times, because the offer coming in was for a game I enjoyed and would rather play.

Olyan érzésem volt, mintha egy nagy kő papír olló játékba csöppentem volna. más szimultán akció választós játéknál ezt nem szoktam érezni. valószinüleg azért, mert itt az ellenfél döntése gyakorlatilag ugyanannyira befolyásolja az én helyzetemet, mint a saját döntésem. A játék maga nagyon érdekes, és tetszik, bár még mindig nem vagyok híve a szöveges kártyáknak( főleg a survival kártyákra gondolok, a hely kártyák rendben vannak, ők az elejétől fogva ott vannak, és kezdetkor végig lehet rajtuk menni, és megbeszélni, melyik mit jelent.).

Didnt hear about this game before so it took me by surprise. Had a lot of fun, really like games where you need to outsmart others, and here it comes to full effect with just enough options and balance to make it close until the very end. On top of that some additional options are added for both alien and explorer players to make it different every time you play. Best played with 4-5 players. Top game for genre 9/10

One of the best games - if not the single best - I’ve played at Essen 2016, Not Alone is both challenging and thematic, as it makes a good job of translating the theme into the rules and even gives the GM a thematically appropriate edge over the players.

RATING: 8
Really good game, i don't know if we can call it a deductive game, but it got some "I thing that you think" mechanic (luck and deduction). 1 vs many type game,  I think the game is balance, some game that i played were very close and other were impressive victory but from both side.  The creature have really mean power, but they can be anywhere.  You feel tension went you play the explorator while the creature try to guess were you are.  Play at 3 or 7 players is fun and it doesn't feel the same (didn't try 2 players, it doesn't feel like it would be fun)

Great game, my gaming group want more of it, i wish their is a expension soon with more location cards, that would give more variety to it.

This small game in everything of a big in its range: simple of accesses, clear rules altogether, easy to handling, speaking and theme (Alien), generator of atmosphere,... everything is good for me.
And then, the game remains interesting whatever is players' number.
In 6 or 7, it is very atmosphere, everyone brings his own small advice while the Creature listens to and concentrates rather on 1 or 2 pursued.
In 2 or 3, it is very tactical with a permanent surveillance of places played.
In 4 or 5, it is the intermediate level, needs to alternate 2 options.
And to finish, I do not often see a game where everything the players are immersed in the play. There is the real tension and each in its own way aspen or perspires when it is necessary to choose a place or to put a pawn pursues. There is the quoted truth bluff, guessing and we really feel all implied in the game hanging 30-45 mn of the play, it is rather rare not to underline it!

Still "bravo" to the author and to the publisher and we hope for an extension in few month.

Neat little one vs many game in which an alien planet is trying to catch the space explorers that crashed on the planet. The game has gorgeous art that really brings out its theme. The game also creates an interesting "metagame" when trying to outsmart the enemy. My biggest gripe is that at higher player counts, the game becomes too difficult for the explorers as the planet will almost always find at least one of the explorers. 1 vs 3 appears to be the optimal count for Not Alone.

This a fun game of psychology, with just enough information to support it. It's kind of a shame that communication between players is pretty rarely required, as making the hunted have to balance the need to strategize together without giving away too much would be interesting. As it is, it's one of the least social bluffing games I've ever played. It's very quiet. Still, it's fun, interesting, and moves at a good pace. I'm happy to have it.

My friend brought this little game to our local board game convention, and our group absolutely fell in love with it. Over two days we probably played it about nine times, and the only reason we stopped was due to the convention closing!

It is a wonderful mixture of tension, tactics, risk and reward, during which both the Creature and the Hunted can make semi-informed decisions based on previous actions (never informed, only ever semi-informed). In my opinion the game is slightly skewed in favour of the Creature player, especially when players are just learning the game, however this just serves to make a Hunted victory all the more precious and satisfying.

By far the MVP of the whole convention, this game has so many great aspects:

- Easy to understand concept, but with so many nuanced tactics/bluffs available each turn
- Completely inclusive: no player elimination
- Doesn't drag on, maximum play time per game is about 30-40 minutes
- "One more game, this time we'll beat you!" mentality off the charts

The first thing I did when I got home from the con is get on Amazon and buy the hell out of it.

Card game in which 1 player plays the planet Artemia and its monster, while the others have to try and escape from the planet before they are assimilated. The planet consists of 10 venues (jungle, swamp, beach...) each with its own action. The players start with 5 of these cards and 3 will points. The monster has to try and figure out which cards the players will play and if it finds a player on that card, the player looses a will point and the monster advances on its victory track. If none of the players is found they advance on their victory track, and can of course use the action of the venue they visited. The monster has some special action cards and the players can obtain escape cards as well.
Simple rules and lots of fun.

[17 Jul 2017] - 5 (1 play)
A one vs rest game where players are trying to secretly pick locations on a lost planet to explore while the alien is trying to trap and injure the players at a location. After our playthrough, the game just felt like another hidden action selection game without much theme. It didn't feel like there was anything unique about this game and trying to deceive the alien didn't seem difficult to do. I'm not sure that I would want to play this again. 

[15 Dec 2017] - 5 (2 plays)
This was played with a larger group again at the Monday night meetup. The alien lost simply by being outnumbered by the humans on the planet. Our alien did do a good job of using the adjacency powers to trap multiple people each time. In the end, it wasn't enough. For the second time, tempers flared between the alien and another player as a turn was nothing but bad news for the alien. The alien started getting short and nitpicking when cards were down, etc. I suspect the right group would make this game more fun and that doesn't seem to be at public game nights with random people.

Great game, entirely unique as far as I know. Wonderful yomi.

Possibly the most surprising thing is how perfectly it scales to all player counts. I don't think I know of any game that scales so well between 2-7. The only flaw is that the Artifact (10) card included in the game is a bust; I don't think you should ever take it. The Green Artifact (currently in the geekstore) is a great fix, and the other options look interesting, too. I hope they're available soon.

Gorgeous graphics, no downtime, a small price for quality components, what is there to dislike ?

NOT ALONE is easy to learn and to teach, although it's better if the Creature already has a few games under her belt. This particular role may be a bit more challenging at first but don't worry, it comes rather quickly anyway.

Not Alone is a game full of double-thinking. The Hunted are trying to predict and avoid the Alien, while the Alien is trying to predict and catch the Hunted, and the tension involved in this cat-and-mouse game is fabulous. This is true especially at the beginning and late stages of each game. The Alien tries to contain the Hunted to their limited 5 location starting hand, likely by blocking the rover. But, a clever Hunted will visit The Lair to avoid and copy the Alien. And this infinitely layerable thinking is what makes this game fun. However, after a handful of plays the location cards begin to feel stale, and playing as the Hunted becomes less interesting. Luckily, playing the Alien is always fun, and being such a small package its easy to overlook is slight lack of replayability.

RATING: N/A
The one vs. all is very well done, and it adds texture to the core doublethink mechanics--which are themselves somewhat hampered by the fact that there's little reason to suspect anyone's going to one place over another.

My group enjoys our share of hidden role/group games (Resistance, ONUW, Werewords, Spyfall, Codenames) and this one went over well with us. We played 1 v 7 which felt like it was a bit easy for the Alien to always stumble on someone each turn, but it ended with us Hunters only 3 spaces away from victory so I guess it's fairly balanced. Wish the Alien cards weren't so damn powerful. I do wonder how differently it plays with fewer than 6 Hunters.

RATING: 7
Assymetrical race game whereby the creature is trying to outguess where the survivors are going to be as catching them pushes him up his track whereas the survivors must manage their hand of cards effectively to evade capture and hasten the arrival of rescue.

It was a really close race and actually enjoyed it more than expected (I am never a fan of 1 Vs man, when I am the 1) but I at least had options every turn. You must look carefully at what cards are already played to narrow down where your human snacks are likely to be found, the hunt card a turn limit is really nice because although you have 3 to choose from none of them are particularly powerful, although those that give you an extra token to cover an additional location are powerful if used at a good time.

One (late night) 5-player game.

[Disclaimer : based on a SINGLE game, with TIRED players, my opinion of the game might be quite different if I play it again in better conditions]

Not too impressed by the game, depsite the huge hype it had in the french community at the Spiel. I must say that I am not a huge fan of bluffing and double guessing games (with the exception of corruption) and, well, Not Alone is basically a (double guessing)^2 game. Well, all in all, it was quite ok and well balanced, but somewhat repetitive. Good thing is that it is short enough for what it offers and avoids the "when is this gonna end" . I will give it a try if asked to join a game (I might have missd something here) but i'll certainely not actively seek to play it.

A nice deduction game that works with a surprising range of number of players. There is just enough choices to make every choice interesting and yet not too much that you can't guess what your opponent is going to do.

Imagine a special power card game that doesn't bother to clarify the ramifications of certain card combinations coming up. Now imagine the rulebook explicitly telling you "We won't fix that situation for you. Do it yourself if you feel you need to." Excuse me? That's Not Alone.

If you are willing to fix such situations yourself there is a game of bluffing and double-guessing waiting for you that pretends to be a little bigger than it actually is (any resemblance to actual monsters is coincidental, I'm sure). There is a lot of fluff (which probably doesn't do a bad job regarding immersion etc.) around what is essentially a pure guessing game as there is precious little substance to the location choices of the Hunted or the Creature.

A "1 vs All" type of game that can have extra cards to help assist the lone person, or the rest if they manage to get past the lone player. Can be more frustrating to play when with a lower amount of people or too large of an amount. Eventually becomes more of a guessing game with not much depth, but still has certain moments in which things can become tense.

Wrażenia całkiem pozytywne. Gra wymaga znalezienia pewnego rodzaju strategii komunikacji, tak aby grać skutecznie. Należy pamiętać o tym, że Obcy wszystko słyszy (ale gdyby nie słyszał, to już całkiem nie miałby szans :D). W pierwszych rundach, przy jedynie pięciu dostępnych lokacjach jest większa szansa na poprawne wytypowanie miejsca pobytu Rozbitków. W miarę rozwoju gry zadanie jest coraz trudniejsze i gra bardzie zaczyna przypominać zwykłe zgadywanie, bo gracze niekoniecznie muszą kierować się strategią czy logiką, a przydatnych pól jest całkiem sporo. Zdecydowanie trzeba zagrać jeszcze parę razy, oboma stronami, żeby móc się lepiej wczuć. Wydaje mi się, że więcej tu zgadywania niż gry w grze.

I liked the mind games between the Creature and the Hunted. However, given the number and impact of Survival and Hunt cards, there is quite a strong randomness which I find more suited to short games. Thus, I felt it could easily overstay its welcome if the players do not play quickly to maintain a good pace.

I could play again but will not suggest it.

RATING: 5
I don't know if it was plain luck or if the game is truly unbalanced, but when I played this the creature felt completely overpowered. As the creature token gives a point every time it hits and the hunted can at best only get a point every other turn in the beginning and has a much longer path, the creature can easily have such a good start that it's impossible to catch up. Also having 3 hunt cards to choose from every turn when the hunted barely get any doesn't seem fair either.

EDIT: I've realised that I played the game wrong, the rescue track moves automatically every turn. This makes the game a lot more balanced and also speeds up the game, I look forward to trying it with the correct rules!

5 plays written down, but def one of those games where people want to play again right after finishing so it's probably closer to 10-20. Still haven't figured everything out exactly to keep it balanced (ie. some people are just bad at being the alien which kind of messes it up, or the alien can just target a really bad player), but when everyone is on the same page, it's a nicely balanced, interesting experience that I'm looking forward to playing again. Compares favorably to coup because it's a simple bluffing game with a little more strategic variance. However, it's more fragile and maybe a bit too long (crank it in

RATING: 7.3
An interesting game, if a little bit lean. Reportedly, it wasn't an enjoyable experience for our Creature player, though as a Hunted player, I thought he did a good job given what he had, and the pressure on us was certainly present. In the future, we would probably play the designer's expert variant to bring healing (i.e. gaining a Will token) back into the game, which felt underpowered in comparison to the alternatives.

In the discussion after the first play, it was our belief that the Give Up action was too weak and without sufficient consequence for the Hunted players. Furthermore, we felt there was very little arc to the Creature's abilities, both thematically and mechanically. 

Therefore, an idea that came up in rough outline was for the Creature to gain a Will token when a Hunted player Gives Up, which the Creature player can then spend later to improve his turn, e.g. play additional cards. Saving up these tokens to spend in a big bang could give the Creature more depth and give Hunted players more challenging decisions to make. A lighter alternative of this variant would be for the Creature player to simply gain an additional Hunt card when a Hunted player Gives Up.

Finally, one of our group mentioned the significant thematic opportunities missed by the so-so art and overall card design. I agree; the game is fine as is, but could have used another level of thematic polish to push it over the top. The publisher went a bit cheap with this small-box game, but I hope it has legs enough to warrant an improved edition.

Specifically, for an improved version, I'd be looking for unique art on the Hunt and Survival cards, better and more consistent art on the Artemia cards, a reworking of the descriptions of the effects of the cards, and more interesting thematic development of the Creature. A little improvement with an eye toward the *feel* of the game for players (especially the Creature) would go a long way.

I expected this game's thematic vibe to come from the Creature being scary-- what will it do? it's so powerful!-- but in my first play, it was really the hand management that did it. You've crash-landed on an alien planet and after one or two turns of dinking around, you WILL need a very specific plan for how you're going to keep enough cards in your hand to survive. Admittedly, if you fail it's because the Creature got you, not because you ran out of food or anything.

Anyhow, I have a soft spot for doublethink games, which means I like this fine but also that it's competing with Witch's Brew and Edel, Stein & Reich for my attention. Hoping to play again, though.

J'ai pas été convaincu par ce jeu français, même s'il est pas mal foutu. Une navette a eu une merde près d'un monde vivable et son équipage, après avoir lancé un dernier SOS, s'est posé sur une planète. Un joueur joue la planète, qui va essayer d'absorber les humains avant que les secours n'arrive. Les autres jouent les humains. Il y a du bluff et il faut coopérer mais en silence pour arriver à vaincre la planète. Intéressant (mais similaire à Colditz, en plus rapide). Les cartes sont jolies.

Played this game four times in a row last game night. Very easy to get a grasp of, but quickly becomes quite the mind game. I do feel that some of the mechanics lead to the game just sort of playing itself, but there's always a little luck, faking out and player synergy going on that really makes the big moments. I can only imagine the play-testing that went into this, and it shows. Plus the game is light enough that when someone dies/gets demoralized repeatedly, it's just hilarious, because thematically, there' always one of those in the group. Fun game, and a good change up for the Avalon, Resistance, Secret Hitler slot even though it is by no means a hidden roles game, more like a light programming game of keep away with panache.

Not Alone sits alongside Raptor as my go-to filler; the former for when we have a group, and the latter for when it's just two players.

For such a simple concept: A hidden movement game with a touch of programming, the tension ratchets up considerably with each passing turn, and decisions are rarely simple.

Not Alone is quick, exciting, entertaining, and exceeded the high expectations I had set going into my first play. This game is an impressive achievement.

This is a one vs many deduction and bluffing game that is quite mathy. The "creature" has to count out the probabilities of players going to a location and players have to try to spread out as much as possible to confuse the creature.

Not Alone has potential but doesn't fully realize it. The idea of trying to dodge an alien until the rescue team arrives is interesting. The alien's task is the opposite: guessing where the players have gone this round. The problem of Not Alone is a need for more development. Not all available locations are interesting, the available additional location cards vary from must-haves to why-should-I-ever-take-this. The rules don't answer questions that derive from combinations of player cards, alien cards and location choices.

In this form, gameplay is average. Especially the group of players don't have many possibilities for clever moves. Variety between plays is limited. This game craves for more diversified location cards.

The game is too heavily stacked in the hunted's favor.  At one point we just had the hunted randomly play cards from their hand for a few games, and they still easily won.  It just felt like there's nothing the alien can really do to take control of winning.

RATING: 8
one of my favs in the 1 vs Many genre. Feels like an evolution of Get Bit, where one of you is creature trying to guess the cards played by the survivors. For them, it is a CoOp game but all their communication must be heard by the creature too which is very fun to interpret. Surprisingly scales well with players.

It was OK, but nothing special. I don't quite get how to really cooperate here. Outguessing your opponent is sometimes fun, but also provides AP. It lasted too long for the lack of excitement. I don't think I will ever suggest it, but if someone really wants to play it I can join.

This worked surprisingly well! The all-vs-one conflict feels balanced and both sides feel legitimately troubled about card choice throughout the game. The creature choice should definitely be someone who has played before. The player count (2-7) is impressive and the game seems to scale well.

This is a really fun hide and seek game of one vs many. Pretty good production values, and interesting play. One player plays as a alien monster hunting the other players who have crashed landed on their planet. As the humans secretly choose which location to go, the Alien chooses where they think the players will go. If the Alien goes to the same location as one or more players they lose will, and the alien player moves one step closer to winning. Each location also has a special ability that if the alien doesn't catch a human player they get to activate the special ability. Great game in a little package.

Got to play at GenCon 2016 and it was by far my FAVORITE game of the Con!!!  Love the one vs. many aspect where everyone is trying to hide from the creature...  while the creature slowly knows more and more information of where you have been!  A definite MUST HAVE!!!!

I really enjoy this game. I like the tension. The artwork is fantastic. It's great to be part of a team working together to avoid the evil alien! I think the flavor of the theme really shows through. Every turn has the evil monster lurking in the background....coming for you!
I've been playing incorrectly, using the Lair card to pick itself back up to all this time. We'll see how future plays go.

I like the game, but it always seems to take just a *tad* too long.

Terrific little card game, pitting a team of 1-6 humans against one alien player. The alien has to guess which locations the humans are going to each round. The options start small, but then expand as the humans start gaining options to their hand, but discard piles are visible so the alien can use deduction to make educated guesses. SUSD highly recommends.

A lot of hype on this one that I just don't see.  Yet another 'guess where the other players are' game.  Yes, it adds some locations with special effects and the players can also get some extra help from cards, but in the end you are just trying to outthink your opponent.

A nice assymetric bluffing game for many players. Quite unique.

Would love more different numbered locations so you can replace the different areas you can go to and make the game setup unique.

Still a very interesting game.

just got it yesterday at the Spielemesse in Essen after playing it through once completely with 6 against one master and it was really fun. Easy to understand, not too much info to read on the cards, so it is a game you can play with people who don't play very often and also a quick one. The strategy is about anticipating what other people might play and lots of fun. So not really a random game at all, but not your typical strategy game either. I really like it! The only slight minus point, is that I think it is a little bit too expensive.
[edit: if in a 2 player game the escaping player plays completely random without looking at his cards it is very difficult for the monster...]

Whoooooa this was harder than it looked! If you think Pandemic is hard, this semi-coöp is probably not for you, but if you want a bigger coöp challenge, this is cliffhanging, nailbiting, intense fun. Definitely requires >3 playthroughs to develop strategies, due to the broad variety of alien-deck cards and explorer-deck interrupt cards and the very wide range of benefits and risks to different locations on the planet. There are also a lot of uncommon mechanics available to the non-alien player(s), and keeping track of all of them can be tricky, but once you've got them down, the planet the team is trying to escape and the alien trying to subsume them into the ecosystem can have a complex, strategic battle of wills with just enough randomness to keep anyone from dominating. Requires a card table at minimum, probably won't be much fun with only 2 players (we found 4 was the best number to allow interplay between explorers needed to extend survival and develop strategies) and is going to be >1hr/game for the first few times, but invest yourself, and you will be rewarded with one of the best shared-adventure experiences out there. Bonus: Great weird-fiction-ecological-SF theme and art to match.

Loved it! I normally hate social deduction games but this one is different enough to stand out from the rest. Is really just hide and seek in a nutshell. 

In summary: The survivors play a card face down and the creature tries to figure out what cards the survivors played. For every right guess the Creature moves forward once on the assimilation track and gets closer to victory. The survivors have their own track in which they move foward at the end of every round, however some cards let you move the survivors token forward more than once per turn. Whoever makes it to the middle of the track wins. There are special cards that the survivors or creature may play once per turn and change the rules a bit, but for the most part thats it! Simple! 

A brilliant game that plays quick, easy to teach and and it is surprisingly balance for both sides. At least from my expirience (two 5 player games).

In our group it was always the same picture (played 6games with 4+ hunted), the Alien had never ever a chance. The best i remember was that he made 5 steps. As hunted its just too easy to hide and get new places. 
The Secret is most of the time, just visit places, which makes no sense for you. So the Alien is always afraid of the Hot Spots (Rover, Beach etc.) and misses them alot. After the players have acces to the other cards (6-10) the game can be quit.

At the end of a round, the marker moves for the hunteds and thats just the key to victory. 
I like the mecanics of the game, but it fell off for me, because their is no real challenge.

A surprisingly light 2-7 player card game that incorporates elements of hidden action selection, deck building, and bluffing.

Relatively simple game of guessing and deduction. I'm curious to try it on less-seasoned gamers.

Very promising, eager to try with more people.

This I had some fun with. Each player has a hand of cards, 1 for each location, and secretly chooses one each turn to gain that location's benefit - which might be to move the time marker along, get a new location card, bring played location cards back to hand, etc. What the game boils down to is that alien player is trying to guess which of the (initially) 5 locations that the others are going to in order to move his own time marker and deprive players of that location's ability. Played cards don't auto-return to hand, so the alien has a higher chance of catching someone as their hand reduces. Lots of guessing and double-guessing, and a lot of cheer factor (when not caught) and groan factor (when caught). The downside is that it's a bit limited because the game is going to give a roughly similarly experience each time - there's only a few locations and only so many double-thinks one can do. But excellent fun for the occasional play.

Fine double guessing game. It is quite simple in mechanic and therefore games can be over very fast. Works fine with different number of players but the gameplay feels different.

Doesn't click for me.
*Plays like an inflated "rock, paper, scissors", you're just guessing what players will do, with little to no hints.
*Communication is open for the monster to hear, which at my tables resulted in nobody even trying to strategize.

Extraordinarily tense one-versus-many game.  I'm not sure it's balanced, but then I'm not sure what balance even *means* for this game.  Sometimes the Creature nails the Hunted turn after turn and it's over before it starts, and sometimes they swing and miss every time.  These outliers keep it from being a perfect 10 for me, but the vast majority of the time it's a nailbiter from beginning to end.

Unique game of having locations where the survivors secretly try to avoid the alien on the hunt, to eventually open up more locations and move the tracker before the alien to be rescued.  I liked the overthinking aspect vs the alien and interactive cards to thwart it.

The locations are crowded in the start, making it easy for the alien to go to one location and hunt another, creating some problems to get going initially.  Unless you get survivor cards, hard to defend vs alien.

Was very much impressed. Theme and mood perfectly captured. We played a 4 player game and I felt we were very much playing against the Alien, who in turn was very determined to catch us. Very tense.
Update : played as the Alien. Got lucky and caught a few survivors. Seemed like an easy win. But then I misguessed a few turns, and suddenly all the excitement was back! 
This is a keeper.

I heard awesome things about this game and I was very curious as to how it played out. The art is certainly attractive and interesting. I can imagine the more players you have the harder it is to win. I think it plays up to 7p! I found it challenging enough with 3 on the good side and Riley as the monster. You really have to get in the head of the monster and try to predict what he might do. It was an interesting game. I would play again, not crazed to do so though.

I've been dying to get this to the table and finally got the chance. We played half way through a game before realizing we were playing a rule wrong. We started over and it was much more balanced. This is an all vs. 1 simultaneous card selection game. I think it played out well and there will be more strategies and less mistakes as we get more experience with it. It does feel like the creature has a minor advantage, but that may just be that his role is much more obvious and easier to pick up. I'm interested to see how the win ratio plays out for us after more plays. I also think that it will play out differently with the other player counts. More people = more possible places to catch someone.

Ein Spieler (das Wesen) spielt gegen den Rest (Menschen). Die Menschen verstecken sich, das Wesen sucht sie, was natürlich glücksbasiert ist, aber die Gespräche ermöglichen wunderbare Mindgames. Ich spiele sehr gerne in der Rolle des Wesens. In meinen Durchläufen hatte ich den Eindruck, dass es für das Wesen in einer größeren Runde einfacher ist, weil man mit steigender Spielerzahl mit größerer Wahrscheinlichkeit jemanden findet. Meinem Eindruck zufolge haben die Menschen nur mit maximal vier Spielern eine Siegchance.

This is a decent one-vs-many game (I do like the idea of this sort of game) of bluffing and deduction that accommodates a good number of players.  After playing it a few times, I do feel that there are card balance issues, and I'm not convinced that the game remains fair as the number of players increases (when there are enough players, the Creature will on many turns feel as though they are just firing their shotgun into a target-rich environment, rather than carefully deducing and striking with precision).  However, the game is engaging, generally fun, and doesn't take too long.

Creature seemed to be overpowered first, but the Hunted definitely need to learn how to effectively get and use their survival cards. They indeed need to fight hard for survival, if they don't, the creature will win.

I played after Speil 2016 with my friends and it was great!! I played with 5 players so I guess it will work with 4 and 6 players too. The artworks are great!! It makes you collect all cards into your hand even you don't have to. The game is short, easy to learn, but hard to win. And there is only 1 monster in each game so you will enjoy taking turns playing monster.
But I wish there was more artworks. I want to see the astronauts using a smokescreen to hide from the monster. I want to see monster using a virus. And most of all, the box cover should have been better. (I didn't buy it because it does not look like a great game.)
I will give 9 if they come up with second edition that have more artworks.

I've enjoyed my games of this so far.  Simple rules and a quick playtime make for a tense  and highly enjoyable hide and seek.  It feels like the timing of when/if you get the right power cards (for both sides) is possibly the biggest determining factor in who wins, but either way, the Hunted have won all three of our games.

RATING: 9
This game is a beer and pretzel game (provided you are not the alien).  You typically just project where you believe the alien will think you are going to and compromise between powerful spaces and less useful spaces.  The game's discard piles and player situations can help put you in the mind of the alien, but at the end of the day the game involves a lot of blind hunches will fairly little information.  It reminds me a lot of Sheriff in the same manner.  

Ultimately this may not be a game for everyone, and our own board game group was more divided on this than any other game, but if you can go into it with a few drinks and a light mindset you are in for some incredible fun guesswork and mind-reading. 

I know this rating may seem high for this game, but for me this is the ultimate beer and pretzels game, perhaps one of the best of them ever created.

So you want to replicate Predator or Alien in a simple ~30 minute game?  This is for you.

This is a 1 vs many game where humans have crashed on a planet and are trying to escape before the alien eats them.  There are 5 basic locations and each round the humans individually and secretly choose where they want to go.  The alien then picks where they are going and if they picked the same spot as the humans, bad things happen.  The humans have a hand management aspect where after they play a card it gets discarded and they can't go there until they are able to return the card to their hand.  Also, one of the actions allows you to get the cards for one of 5 advanced locations, giving you more options and stronger abilities.

The rules are simple and so much of the game revolves around bluffing and deduction.  The alien gets to play a special card each turn that often lets him attack multiple locations or messes with the humans in some fashion.  The humans also occasionally get special cards that help them mess with the alien.  Overall, it comes together in a great package.  Easy to teach and play.  No player elimination (if you die, the alien gets points and you respawn).  Pretty good deduction/bluffing.  It kind of reminds me of Coup, but without the Munchkin-style last man standing or player elimination that make Coup a bad game.  I think it would also play well from 4-7, so that's a nice range.  Definitely recommended.

RATING: 8.9
This game is terribly underrated, for what is a superb one vs many bluffing game of 'cat and mouse'. Try and outsmart the alien, expand your hand of cards and don't get caught with limited options. Or, as the alien, try to get inside your opponent's head, or logically deduce your best option for capturing or shutting down your opponent's abilities. The gameplay mechanics work so well with the theme, and I really like the artwork.

A formidable filler. Can feel a bit capricious at times, especially when the he-knows-that-I-know-that-he-knows routine gets pronounced, but there's so little rules overhead and it's so brisk that I'm inclined to forgive the occasional fumble.

First play impression: really enjoyed this game. 1vsAll games tend to be problematic, but this one is fast and easy enough that you can play a few games in a row, switching off who plays as the creature. It's essentially a hide-and-seek guessing game where the creature is trying to guess the right places that the players will go, and the players are trying to just survive a number of rounds.

A unique game that takes about 20 minutes and can play a larger group.

Excellent 1 v all deduction game, explorers try to outwit the monster hunting them.

Handy one to have in your collection too because it's a sub 60 minute game and plays up to 7.

Has a lot of excitement and drama when players reveal cards and find out if they were caught or not.

A bit of a shame they didn't build the game in a way to make randomly selecting your location completely non viable.

Other than that top notch.

The balance can swing wildly for a while, but after a couple of turns it settles and the strategies start to materialize for both hunter and hunted. The components are simple and effective, save for the hunter chips. They're poker quality chips, they're beautiful and their weight in your hand feels wonderful. The art is outstanding as well. Definitely better with more people as it makes the bluffing more effective so you as to up your ability to confuse the creature.

Players try to survive long enough on a hostile environment. One player controls hazards and the alien.

Had fun playing the hunted more than the creature. As the creature, I felt a little stressed, and when all of the locations became available, I just felt stupid because I couldn't catch anyone. That is NOT the game's fault, though. Another excellent game for a high player count and is quick, which makes it perfect for game nights and holidays when you may need something lighter.

I normally like a game of second guessing, but this just isn't fun. Too many options mean that every action does something useful, so difficult to second-guess.

I don't know about this one, I like bluffing games, but Not Alone didn't do it for me. In our game the "good guys" didn't talk to each other because there was no reason to give an alien any clues about their plans. It was a rather silent game of cat and mouse. Maybe we were too serious about it. On the upside, the tension is really there.

An ok game if you don't mind multiplayer solitaire.  NO player interaction at all.

[played in 3] the main idea is rather fun and intriguing. It's fast, it works quite well and yes, there is suspense and tension when you need to decide where to go and when the alien is revealed. Therefore, all in all, a nice experience.
On the other hand, I guess it will be quite short-lived and repetitive

Asymmetric cat & mouse card game where the sentient planet attempts to assimilate the shipwrecked intergalactic explorers. Explorers use hidden movement by selecting from their depleting hand of location cards.  Locations (additional places can be unlocked) have special use when explorers hide safely.  The planet player uses hunt cards and movement to trap them and spend their will. First group to completely advance on the end game track wins.

My favourite asymmetrical game. Manages to exist almost in it's own genre; it's a game that excels with 5 to 7 players and yet isn't hidden role. I think I enjoy playing the super-powered creature just as much as the "hunted".

A game of hide and seek that has hand/deck management, guessing, tension and goes up to 7! This is one of the best small one vs many games out there (if not the only one). The expansions  give this game much needed longevity.

Maybe I am not smart enough but it seemed pretty obvious what the world was going to do and what little we could do about it. Probably need another game or two.

Print and Play. This is my most played game at the moment. Two players so far, and it is great. Quick, light, easy to teach. It has plenty of bluffing/second guessing, I say plenty - that's the whole premise of the game. It is an excellent game and one I'd recommend (though we play a slight variant).

I've played the game a couple times with groups. I like the idea of the game, but it doesn't feel very balanced. With only a few players (1-3) it is quite hard for the alien to win. With many players (6-7) it seemed much too easy for the alien to catch the Hunted and move forward on their track. If you had enough people with experience this balance issue could be mitigated, but it was annoying. I would like to play it a couple more times though to see if it starts to balance out better with more reps.

While bluff/deduction is generally a very successful repellent for me, this one sounds like it would be entertaining for those times when people less inclined towards heavy games are present.

Excellent but I think the alien had bit of an advantage with 7 players. We will house rule something for balance.

I haven't seen the Hunted ever win yet. However, I love the hide and seek aspect of this game. So simple but compelling.

This is not a game for me. I think it takes on the sort of task that it does, better than anything I've played, but in the end, I did not find it satisfying to play. The Creature certainly seemed to enjoy the intense challenge of playing against 6 others….

Played with 3, neat little bluffing / guessing game. I think it would be better with more players.

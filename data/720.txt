The board/map is engaging and adds some tactical decisions, but strategically, it's still Monopoly.

RATING: 3
Terrible game, although still enjoyable to play.  Pretty much the only decision you make is which franchise to build when you first open a market, and if you pick the wrong one, you're just out of the game.  Period.

That said, when it's Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Atkinson cleaning your clock in this game, at least it's thematic?

RATING: 5
A fast light but brutal version of Monopoly.  Several in my game group really like it, but the lack of original mechanics and the poor quality of the components overwhelm the positives of this game for me.  It really looks as though it could have been put out by Cheapass Games.  I have trouble considering it as more than a filler, because like Monopoly, I don't think that you have a lot of control over your future.

Put a lot of advertising out and place your stores together so that you can link them up for more money as you pass Go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better in many respects than Monopoly (eg more choices/decision required),  but still Monopoly at heart, with a veneer of more control.  Great if you're winning, dismal if you aren't.

Surely Monopoly inspired.  Nice ideas but shows its age.  Much luck flowing from the dice rolls.  Happy to have played but no desire to play again.

RATING: 6
This is based on just one play.  I thought the game was very interesting, and a significant upgrade on Monopoly.  The inner board is used well for expanding your franchise.  Likewise, I can see this taking less time than Monopoly due to the speed at which your fortunes can change (and the fact that there is a target amount of money).

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This game is MEAN, Wow!  I knew going in it was going to be a bit rough, but holy smokes, this one smacks you around good.  This game is also not very forgiving, and it seems like you can get in a bad spot quick if your don't choose the correct company.  The roll and move in this one actually works well (don't laugh), and my rating of a 6 is NOT because of it.  My only issue with the game is the player elimination.  In our 1st game about half way through it was pretty clear that two players were in trouble, and after that point the rest of the game probably not fun.  If the game didn't have this issue, to be honest I might of given this sucker an 8.  I really enjoyed the rest of it.  The paper money sucks, and the board looks horrible, but there is actually a fun game in this one.  One I plan on keeping, and trying to get played from time to time.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Just love this one.  Yeah, it's roll and move but how you add your franchises and markets to the board and how you extend your chains add alot more that you realize to the game.  One of my most played games over the past 10 years...  You can play ANY of the corporations and win (been on an Ice Cream Scream kick) by using appropriate strategy.  

Can you get screwed on a roll, sure.  But who cares!  Good, fun stuff!

Update:  Who am I kidding.  This game is a 10 in my book.  It has become over the years one of the staples in my collection.  

Still good.

Mar 2016 - Not changing my rating but a note.  I have found this to be an EXCELLENT gateway game.  Everyone is familiar with Monopoly, this has those similarities but with the added Acquire like game (and is not mainstream).  This has always intrigued people who might play games.  I have created gamers from this game.

This is a charming game.  It doesn't have flaws so much as an unfortunate inheritance.  "Unfortunate" is a little strong a word.  I think Lehmann's design does some wonderful things with the basic tropes of monopoly and produces a game that manages to feel like we remember monopoly feeling when we were young.  That's an impressive feat and Lehmann should be commended. 

Though I likely won't request it, I'm happy to play this game any time.

This one hasn't aged well, in terms of the acceptance of things like: roll and move, player elimination.

Somehow, its still fun to play.

If you view it as an alternative to Monopoly, you'll be pleased with your game play experience. But in the big scheme of things, its probably getting more play for nostalgia than on its own merits when stacked against the top games of this era.

It feels a bit too much like a Monopoly variant and it's missing my favorite part of Monopoly, the trading.  One of the ugliest boards I've laid eyes on.

I'm going to try to play it with the bank, instead of the player who landed on another player's market, paying out the cash.  So no player elimination and it's a fight to $1 Mil.

I was led to understand that this was Monopoly made fun.  I finally got a chance to try it, and it's definitely an improvement on Monopoly.  There's a lot more going on, and more interesting decisions to make.  But the end of the day it's still roll the dice and move your mice, and it's still about getting lucky on events and strategy cards.  It's still not a game for me.

RATING: 6
I entered into playing this game with my mind made up that I probably wouldn't end up liking it. However, by the end of the game, I had realized that this is a pretty decent game. Roll and move games that are not terrible are always welcome in my home, and I was satisfied to find another roll and move title that is decent. FFF in a nutshell is all the good of Monopoly and Acquire distilled into another game. And on top of that, this is a that can be explained on the fly. Since strategy is dictated by opportunity, a brief overview of the game could be explained at the outset, and more can be explained as players encounter the spaces.

I really like the way advertising works in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game, even when you are losing badly.  I don't understand all the comments that it takes too long -- this game plays quickly, and is basically an unstable equilibrium -- once one player gets ahead in the mid-game things tend to get worse for everyone else quickly. Also someone commented that advertising was pointless -- Actually we've found that advertising in the late game is a great way to put the nail in the coffin and finish things up quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a remarkably enjoyable game, considering that it looks a lot like Monopoly.  It also plays quickly if you know it well and don't dither; with my regular group it never takes more than an hour.

(Note for disclosure:  I was a playtester for this game, way back in the dawn of history.)

Monopoly gone wild. The components are nothing great, and there's a definite "the rich get richer" and "you landed on the wrong spot, you're dead" feel of Monopoly. But you're more in control of your destiny than Monopoly.

RATING: 3
A game that is very similar to Monopoly.  About the only differences are:

(1) It will usually end somewhat faster.  This is because of the "rich get richer" mechanic of the game.  If someone lands on another players market, not only do they have to pay that person but then that person can expand there franchise again making it more punishing to the  next player to land on it.
(2) It gives the illusion of strategy by having a middle of the board franchise area.  This middle area allow players to place their franchises in ways to either try to maximize the number of franchises that impact outer ring market values or to cut off other players franchises.

Why this game gets more love than Monopoly, another bad game IMO, I will never understand.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Unlike Monopoly, Fast Food Franchise has winning conditions that will not let the game go on forever.  A specific monetary amount by the leader ends the game, as does ANY player elimination.  You define your strategy based on the companies you buy, where you place your locations, and whether or not you wish to advertise.  As evidenced by the file section here on BGG, someone else obviously thought that creating some new companies would enhance the replayability of this game.

Just played a game the other day.  One of my opponents (an accountant by trade) managed to get 3 markets side by side with his Steak and Salad franchise.  He eventually manged to get 7 franchises in that group.  When someone landed on the market for that business it was game over for them (according to the dividend chart we owed over 1 million).  I am not sure if we played correctly... seems odd.

Monopoly influenced game where players invest in franchises and build them across the middle of the board.  The middle-board play is fun.

I'm sure the comparison to Monopoly is constantly shown, but this plays much more quickly and has much more choice and strategy. The method of expanding the size of your franchises into the board gives some depth, but it is still countered by the randomness of where you land. It looks like it'll still come down to some lucky roles, but still will depend on player skill. Knowing which franchises to open seems to be important, since they all have different attributes.

There are many great ideas here, fettered away, because at its heart it is Monopoly.  All the stuff in the center of the board is great.

There is just too much luck here, especially considering how long the game is.

This rating may or may not be fair, as it is based on one playing.  However, it is because of that playing that the game has not seen further table time, so pending further data(and it's already been 5+ years, so it could be a long wait), I will respect my first impression.

RATING: 4
1 play. Better than what I remember of Monopoly, but if you want a roll-and-move game, play Verflixxt! Yes, there is some tactical play here, in the way you position your markets and franchises, and some strategy in how you run the varoius businesses. However, the game is too long and the strategy and tactics seem to be far overshadowed by the luck of the dice and card decks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A valiant effort to improve upon Monopoly, albeit an unsuccessful one.  There are enough franchises to go around for everyone and the decisions are pretty basic, so the entire game, which lasts way too long, basically boils down to luck.  You could make a case that Monopoly works the same way, but at least it has much more personality.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I feel this game may have another level to it that monopoly doesn't have, the sort-of area control/route building aspect which I really like but this game lasts longer than monopoly, provided you are playing monopoly correctly. Maybe if the board was edited, remove any Event spots and reduce advertising spots so there is more opportunity to build and expand and maybe it would move quicker.

Monopoly with a tile-laying aspect.  Fun, with enough depth to make you think.  If the players I played with would slow down long enough to let me think. :-)

Best Roll & Move game.

This was once a favorite, but has aged poorly as better games have come out since.  Interesting cross-breed of Monopoly and Acquire mechanics is wasted by the roll-poorly-and-you're-screwed design.

I find it funny that a majority of BGG users bring the hate against Monopoly, but a bunch of people also rave about Fast Food Franchise.  Both games have elimination, rich-get-richer mechanisms, and dice that have a habit of dictating the most important decisions of the game.  Why does this game get so much love from the BGG community?  I'm baffled.

Always a delight to bring out when Monopoly is suggested.  Plus I'm 0-4 against my wife...

You can see that this is based off of "monopoly" but don't let that influence you. This is a very good game with tough decisions that is accessible to gamers and non-gamers. Try to find this one and play it.

too much luck driven.  it's like monopoly, but just a little better. i admit, i probably opened the wrong company, but it was also way too late, and another player lucked out and got three markets open on the first turn.

I suppose it's an upgrade to Monopoly, but that's not saying much. Terrible components, lots of roll and move, and horribly shifting fortunes based on the whim of the dice. And all that with the added fun of player elimination!

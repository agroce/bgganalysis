This is a great solitaire in the State of Siege system. Difficult, excruciating decisions; not too simple; and offers alot of replayability. Not many new ideas, but executed rather well. Viva la Revolution!

Update: after playing some more games in the State of Siege system (although skimped out on the rather popular We Must Tell the Emperor), it is by far my favorite of that system. Simple, elegant, nail-biting, and extremely thematic.

I played this game in my history class, and found it to be surprisingly entertaining. I'm usually not a fan of solitaire board games, but I enjoyed this one. Playing it actually helped me on the test for the French Revolution, but it didn't feel purely educational. I could play this game for days on end without getting tired of it, and I hope to purchase a copy.

RATING: 7
It is a very basic [family=3245]State of Siege[/family] game, much like, say, [thing=94949][/thing].  The most interesting part is the scoring system, where the monarchy and despotism values can really hose you, so it's not "running out of a resources," and losing the game.  Instead, you have to actively push them down and stay focused on it while keeping the enemies at bay.

It's not going to replace the best State of Siege games ([thing=144568]Dawn of the Zeds[/thing], [thing=70519][/thing], and [thing=114261]Malta Besieged[/thing]), but it's a fun little game with a good history lesson baked into the cards.

RATING: 8
Very clean and intuitive system that cleverly creates the chaos of the revolutionary period. Players must wrestle with political factions trying to bring the republic down (monarchy and despotism), civil unrest in Paris which never seems to end, and the external forces of the advancing armies of Piedmont, Austria, Prussia and Britain not to mention the continuing royalist rebellions in the Vendee. 

A very complex situation has been brilliantly distilled here to a very simple system. I can see why it is being used as a teaching tool on the period. 

Two plays so far, and two defeats but I'm getting better. Maybe with repeated playings the system will become dull, there is a lot of die rolling, but this is still a keeper. Plays fast and the cards "random" ordering ensure different challenges each play.

Played the Android version, my rating reflects my level of disappointment because I was expecting a lot more of this system in general and this game in particular... It's a light dice fest almost no brain because you are at the mercy of the events, the decisions are automatic, trying to mitigate the advance of the different armies, to be precise, the closest to Paris.

Solitaire games, to be interesting to me, should feel a little less like, well, Solitaire. LeM feels like a game of Klondike where even if you play everything right, you can get hosed by hidden information or rotten luck, which is not a very interesting sort of puzzle.  I haven't played a ton of this one, so I'm totally open to the idea that there's something essential I'm missing. But if there is, I'm missing it.

(I majored in tautology in college.)

I can see a potentially good multi-player quasi-coop coming out of the bones of this game -- a cross between Pandemic and Liberte with a dash of Republic of Rome. But that's not this game. [i]This[/i] game is a playable but not especially compelling pastime.

I have it for iOS, which nicely presents the mechanics and is probably a good platform for this sort of game, but an iOS user could just as easily get an actual wargame (Bulge) for a few dollars more...

Excellent solitaire game where the player has to defend the Republic from encroaching foreign armies, as well as managing the local politics.  Fifth or sixth game in the States of Siege series, and probably the best yet.  A very tight design that feels a lot more like Soviet Dawn and Israeli Independence than the others, but closer to Soviet Dawn in complexity.  Lovely blend of history, game play and mechanics that are easily mastered.  I don't mind admitting I learned a lot about the French Revolution just by reading the historical text on the cards.  Excellent.

RATING: 6
While the story and tension is strong in this game, the choices and control are very low. This is especially true of the iPad version (which is the version I played) where while there are some choice, ultimately it's up to the dice and the cards to say what happens. The choices are always very obvious and if the dice are not with you, you'll fail whether or not you had the best choices.
Interesting for a few minutes (which is how long it takes on the iPad) but nothing more.

iOS version. I haven't played a physical copy, so component quality was not a factor in my rating.

A pretty shallow game. 75% luck + 25% obvious strategies. After a couple of plays, you should master the strategies. After that, it's just a game of roulette.

Despite this, I had some fun playing it. It's nicely themed and has a lot of tension. I can't just can't fully get past the shallow strategy and high luck factor.

I may try a physical copy so I can check out the expansion. I brief perusal of the expansion shows that it may result in a deeper game.

RATING: 9
Very enjoyable gameplay, and (despite being a military history buff) I learned a great deal about the period. The player skill level dominates the game, yet there is enough luck that you are going to lose some of the time, no matter how good you are. Very tense and always fun to play -- whether you are being crushed or score a staggering triumph.
My only quibbles deal with the fact the game could be "tougher" (and realistic, or should I say "less gamey") and the Victory levels could be "adjusted". Although I have suffered my share of defeats, most of the time I am going to win and it is always some degree of Republican Triumph -- I have not had anything in between in 20+ games. 
Still, this is a solitaire game -- make a few minor adjustments when you are ready and you can continue on playing a fun, challenging game.

Interesting and fun system. Nice and light, and has kept me coming back for at least a few plays. I don't know if it will have much long-lasting value, though. In the end, like most solitaire wargames, it's essentially a big puzzle, and I don't enjoy that as much as just pushing pieces around. Because I don't like the feeling of being frustrated and losing all the time. I'm finding that I'm better off playing a two-player game solitaire, and enjoy that more.

Definitely requires some knowledge of the decks, and the flow of the game, to do well. Very difficult for me.

My best result so far is a whopping -57 points, the only time I actually got to the red deck. 

-- Update: Things completely turned around last night and I got +17 points for a big Republic victory.

RATING: 8.5
I am a high school history teacher and this game is a nice way to add depth to some of the vital events of the revolution. I read students the title of each card and have them predict what the results will be. If they do I give them an DRM as a bonus; if not heads roll and they are out of the game! I also sometimes break up students onto TEAMS and each team must survive the revolution but with a different leader in power (King, Napoleon, and/or Robespierre). Outside of the classroom it's an elegant system that is smooth, quick playing and fun; but I would say has a limited shelf life once you figure out a "winning strategy."

I tend to rate solitaire-only games a bit lower than two player games (just so you know my bias).  Also, this comment is based on the iPad version, not the print version.

This was my first States of Siege game, and I wasn't WOW'd by the system.  I can see why others like it, but it just doesn't do it for me.

I don't seem much replayability here for me.  The game provides a nice overview of the French revolution, there is some variability from the cards, and there is some tension as the enemy closes in, but I wasn't finding the decisions deep or interesting.

22.95 from VPG...quite expensive for semi-professional product.  The high rating of the game here in BGG seems to suggest a cool gameplay.  Besides, people are fascinated by the French Revolution, for better or worse part of it.    

It is a war simplified to one thing - the capture of Paris. The royal sympathizers from the Piedmont, Vendee, Prussian, Spanish and the half-hearted Britain (it could be beaten back two spaces in one naval combat) are encroaching to Paris in three stages of horrors, pace of which completely random from a card-based system. I was defeated in all games and I have yet to figure out if there is really a strategy. For a quick, fun resolve in any free time you gather, this is a perfect choice to get into the revolution without much pain in what was essentially a reading and rolling dice exercise. Although I won the game on the fourth, by observing the general active period of the enemies of the French Republic, I still feel bounded by fate of the universe (aka, the System) instead of decisions made on my own. Deterministic game!

Update: this one ends up getting a 6 primarily because I'm just not that into the French Revolution; Soviet Dawn or Ottoman Sunset are more likely to hit the table.

I'm really liking this one; it has great narrative flow.  The political tracks give you interesting dials to twiddle as you weigh the benefits of trying to adjust them vs. the cost of the action, and the effect of the cards on the tracks nicely illustrates the political outcome of the historical event listed on the card.

The States of Siege line hits the sweet spot for solitaire games: fast setup and teardown, relatively short play times (but not so short as to be not worth the effort of setting up) and a decent amount of choices to be made, while minimizing fiddliness.

Looking forward to seeing more games from John Welch.

I was disappointed with this game. I am interested in French Revolution history - and I did learn something from reading the cards - but I don't think I got a better understanding of the Revolution from the game itself.

Maybe I am missing something, but I just don't see how the mechanics of the game are integrated in the theme. Yes, it gets the point across that there were many different interested parties and political ideologies involved in the Revolution, but in this game they are moved back and forth by the roll of a die. What do you learn from that? What enjoyment do you get from that?

Just got this game today 1/18/2011, can't wait to get it on the table. I rate these games a bit higher than others since the mechanics are more or less similar, and I already own 6 games from this series and played 4 of them already, only won the Israeli Independence game a few times, lost the other 3. Played all of them now, and again only won a couple of the Israeli Independence games, but these games are so good I keep wanting more. this one so far is my favorite with Ottoman Sunset coming in a close second...

I have enjoyed this game and have used it in my High School history classes.  The kids seemed to really enjoy the game also.  After two or three plays, however, my students were too much aware of the cards,and could make the right decisions (with just average luck on the die rolls) and win every time.  All groups of my students, after two games were able to score +16 to +18 every time.  Even when I introduced the expansion cards and rules it was very easy for them to win the game.  It made no difference whether I randomly shuffled each deck, or played it in numerical (historical) card order.  The results were the same.  Some of my students suggested taking out several cards (Treaty of Amiens for example) so things would not be as predictable.  All in all,however it was a good educational experience and I used John Welch's (designer) lesson plans to great effect.

Edited:  We discoverd that we were not playing the Paris Disorder correctly. MUST use an ACTION to bring it back into order even though automatic in certain situation!!  Now my students found it much more difficult to win!

Levee en Masse is much less fiddly than John Welch's later more complicated Cruel Necessity (which is also cruelly hard to win than Levee en Masse and most other SoS games).

LeM has 3 political tracks, giving a bit of similar flavor to CN's 6 political tracks, in a much sleeker and faster playing (and less frustrating) package.

FWIW this may be the easiest to win of the States of Siege games, so anyone who likes the idea of SoS but is frustrated by their difficulty of winning might want to seriously consider Levee en Masse.

Another superb States of Siege game.  An excellent, historical, solitaire "wargame" that ranks with Zulus on the Ramparts and We Must Tell the Emperor as VPG's finest.  Though unlike the others, the expansion is practically a must, especially if you want Napoleon around.  Great decision making and FUN!  I can see its potential in a history class.  Not punishingly difficult either but the scoring will keep you coming back to improve repeatedly.

RATING: 6.5
My experience with the State of Siege series is that they are very fun for a short while and then once you've burned out on them, that's that.  I've played quite a few games in the series and Levee is one of the more interesting ones, as it covers a somewhat underrepresented period and does so with fairly streamlined rules.  As with the other scripted games in the series, the difficulty ramps up absurdly with the last deck, which makes for some frustration.

Ipod version

I appreciate the historical information provided from the cards.

Apart from that, I fail to see where is the strategic thinking/decision making in the game. I could just buy a die and roll it on my table for half an hour, it would be the same (no)satisfaction. In reality the game plays itself, I see myself having only a minor interference- a puppet that rolls the die so the game engine keeps running. Where is the reward for a good decision and the punishment for a bad one? Are there things in the game that are not obvious to the point that there is no need to think for a second?

 I don't know, maybe some people will like it but I really fail to see the game here. Good that I tested it from my iPod and I only lost couple of euros, this system is obviously not for me.

UPDATE> I gave it another try just to see if it would get any better or if there was something I didn't see the first time. Conclusion: it's the worst thing I've ever wasted 20 minutes on. :angry:

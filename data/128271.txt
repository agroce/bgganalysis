Too much randomness and luck of the draw, whether it be tiles or cards.  Interesting concept, but I don't feel like I have complete control over the actions I take in the game.

RATING: 8
Funky mashup of mechanics I like; area influence, hand drafting, and tile laying. That the score isn't revealed until the end is a great touch (helps prevent demoralization when you get curb stomped mid-way through the game). A surprisingly interactive game for what amounts of an abstract euro. Excellent components, lots and lots of nice things to say about the game.

The downside is that it has one of the strangest deck shuffling side effects I've seen with where you play on a tile and then pull out the new number when things run out. As it stands, often times with certain player counts you end up doing this every other or every third turn for a while to get up and running and that's a break in thinking and momentum. Solidly recommend it at 2, 3 can be really fun, 4 is ok, and I wouldn't play it with 5.

Engine building, tile placement... what's not to like?! There is some luck in drawing the card types that you want, but you have several resources to balance and the option to refresh your hand twice to mitigate the bad luck factor. When the game is on its last turn or two, it is common to see the color of mega cities change color as people try to influence who gets the big piece of pie and definitely use those refresh hand chips.

Ginkgopolis manages to combine several of my favorite mechanics into a single game. Like collecting actions and abilities in a tableau in front of you (As in [thing=19857][/thing])? Ginkgopolis has that. Like card drafting (As in [thing=68448][/thing] or [thing=133473][/thing])? Ginkgopolis has that too! Like area control (As in [thing=40692][/thing] or [thing=30645][/thing])? You guessed it: Ginkgopolis has that too! 

These are three of my favorite mechanics so on the surface this would be a game that really appeals to me: and it does! There is a little bit of randomness inherent in the multi-use cards, but to me, there's nothing that you can't plan for. If you find yourself flummoxed by the cards, you're probably not flexible enough in the area control, nor powerful enough in your player tableau.

There's only one problem with this game: it's got a lot of brains, but not a lot of heart. You're competing to build a city in Ginkgo trees, for goodness sakes! The game may be brilliant, but it's dressed in undeserving clothing. I don't know what theme could have been put on this game to better fit, but I do know that this game is criminially underserved by its lack of theme. Players never want to pull it off the shelf, and consequently it languishes at 2 plays for me. 

But! If you want to look past the appearance and dig into some tasty mechanics, this is the game for you. Trust me. . .want to play? Tableau-building meets area-control meets drafting. Yes, this is Ginkgopolis: the game as weird as its name. There's no theme, no reason to draw you in, but the game is a mechanical marvel.

The rules were great, but the play never quite got to the point where the decisions were intuitive.  Lots of interesting choices, though.  Very well-produced game.  I think the running time is closer to 2 hours, but it was interesting from beginning to end.  Fun game!

RATING: 8
This is one of the few games so far that I felt it was almost unfair to rate after only one play. There is a lot of stuff going on here, and it took a few turns before I saw the effects of my actions. I could see this rating changing quite a bit after another play.

I liked the art style. I liked the way the draw pile changes over the course of the game, I like how you build a 3 dimensional board with the great colors and functional iconography. The game is definitely well designed.

So why a 6? I'm not overeager to play it again, and my ratings reflect my eagerness to play again. I'm sure I will, I didn't dislike it, I just probably wouldn't suggest it. The simultaneous action selection means that you cannot really 'react' to what another player does, you're choosing your actions somewhat blind. And because you hand off your cards to the next person, you don't get to form a turn-to-turn strategy.

The result is that each turn is a tactical decision, with little long term strategy from the beginning to end of the game. I will say, this is one game that I plan to play again, because it is DEFINITELY possible that with additional plays I could see a deeper strategy to the game.

I'm erring on the more positive side of rating this one because it is a very unique card drafter. It's got some funky idiosyncrasies and symbology that make it a bit odd to wrap your brain around at first--and I worry about how much of a VP salad everybody wins type of game it is. 

But the dynamics are really interesting. I just have no idea how to play well at this point.

A very clever game, though somewhat random - last turn luck of the draw can really be the deciding factor if players were dead even otherwise.  Components in the face-to-face game are great, and the digital tabletop makes it very quick.  Either way, it's a nice mix of tile-laying and engine-building with a somewhat nonsensically integrated theme and great art that plays reasonably quick once people learn it and is surprisingly intuitive.

RATING: 7
Area building and control, engine building and card drafting.  You might imagine that's at least one too many mechanisms, but they all work together in smooth and not overly complex combination.  Ginkgopolis resolves into a balancing act between developing your engine, maintaining supplies of tiles and resources, placing tiles to improve your end game scoring, and taking vps now.  It is a highly tactical game.  Tight resources and a choice of four cards each turn will determine what you are able to do.  It is also a better game with lower numbers.  My one play with four felt a touch too chaotic.

The artwork is a bit different and quite pleasant.  Production quality is good.

RATING: 7
Good tile laying eurogame with minor area control aspects. The rules are quite simple but the game manages to provide enough depth and decisions. I like the card drafting part. The game flows nicely and the city changes rapidly. The same is true for the ownship of buildings. The artwork uses vivid colours and is aesthetically pleasing. Despite the artwork, Ginkgopolis feels quite abstract at times.

Bought in Essen 2013. Played once and the games kind of agrees with me, I like the feel and I believe that with more players it become more cutthroat - something I appreciate in a Euro. I am not sure even if I figured out a strategy for playing, but this feels like one of those games which need several plays to master it (not rules, strategy!)

Rated 7.25 (provisional rating after 1 game) with the possibility of one extra point depending on how it plays with more players.

EDIT: after a four-player game I must say I like the game even more and I cannot wait to add it the expansion. The quick game play and interesting decisions every turn make me want to put this on the table again. rating changed to 7.75

After one play, I can say the game provided some mellow fun, but it's card play did not seem particularly tractable or logical or understandable.  Interesting how playing the game felt good enough, but was not entirely satisfying.  

I can see how perhaps more plays would provide a better understanding of the nuances of the game, and thus greater enjoyment.

This one combines a bunch of mechanics.. tile-laying, city-building, area-control, card drafting and dual-use cards.. but does so without becoming an unwieldy mess. Really can't say enough great about this game, the strategy continues to go deeper the more you play it, interaction is strong.. really a near perfect game.
The only reason I dropped it .5 was the fact that you really have to play it 3 or 4 times before you'll be able to compete

RATING: 8.3
A neat tile building game with a 3d element, you are urbanizing and raising structures for a bio-friendly development in the future, and then scoring them. There is a bit of drafting and some other pretty interesting mechanics, colorful characters you can choose which will inform your starting Resources and give you bonuses later, as will some of the Building cards. The art is cute on the tiles and other components, and it's a fluid design for Xavier Georges, if not his best. The theme in this base game does feel absent...usually I can wrench it out of even the driest Euros or abstracts, but here it seems to end with the art. Perhaps the expansion will help there if I can find it.

A mix bag of mechanics that comes together in a fluid and interesting way. You got engine-building, card-drafting, tile-placing, area-control, etc. Overall, the game feels very abstract, which may be a turn off for some players. But it produces a puzzle that is interactive, has numerous viable strategies, feels unique, and can be played within 45 minutes.

A few weeks, I played a game of Carson City, which I absolutely loved and sought out if there any copies available. Sadly, that game seems to be out of print. But it did lead me back to Gingkopolis, which at the time of release I had shunned as a bit too complex and abstract for my taste. But after re-watching the video and downloading and reading the rules, I think I got the game down.

So last Saturday I was able to play two games of Gingkopolis, one with two players and one with four players. Like almost everybody else, I found the components were of excellent quality and the artwork was cute and somewhat charming, albeit somewhat cold as well, which reflected the theme as well. I found the game wasn't as fiddly as I was lead to believe. The card play went smoothly and even the 'deck-building' wasn't too bad. For me, the biggest problem was making sure I had gotten all the points, tiles and resources that I should have gotten. Maybe I've just been around the game block for so long that these game play elements now feels like second nature to me. Although after the two player game, we removed the resources before scoring area-majority ...

But unfortunately my intimidate response was disappointment with game. Firstly, I felt that exploiting tiles (i.e. the 'card-only' option) was inferior to getting tiles out on the board (by urbanizing and building upwards) and activating neighboring tiles to get a lot more stuff. More importantly, I found the game was too quick for my tastes, particularly the two player game. In that game, we only had gone through the deck once or twice before the tile stacks ran out. Thus, we couldn't do much 3+ building upwards, which limited the tableau and engine building. 

But rereading Oliver Keliey's review, maybe I had misjudged the game. (Also, Carson City was a quick game with only four rounds; maybe that that's just how Xavier rolls.) Perhaps I had focused too much on my initial advantages of building up, and missed more opportunities for getting points. Maybe players have to be aware and control the speed and tempo of the game, just like Race for the Galaxy. Hey, it even works thematically - in a resource-depleted future, it problem not a good idea to grow too fast.

The game this reminds me most of is Glen More. Both games have similar array of mechanisms - drafting, tile placement, area-majority scoring - arranged in a (much) different way (e.g. tile placement is shared and drafting is private in Gingkopolis, while in Glen More tile placement is private and drafting is shared). I think comparing the two games does bore out your observation regarding names and theme. The theme on both games can come off as thin, but Glen More does feel more 'friendly' in that regard. The fact that anonymous yellow building 12 that if I build over it gives me this ability seems inexplicable; but the wheat field makes me wheat and the market lets me sell that wheat for VP, which is far more relatable and understandable (although that doesn't always work - which should this loch let me active one of my other tiles, but this loch lets me activate ALL my tiles?).

ED: Bummed this down a notch, given how difficult it is too get to the table.

RATING: 6
The game has some nice mechanics, albeit ones that we've seen elsewhere lots of times. The way you create a snowball effect with the cards you keep is nice, and the draft mechanic keeps the otherwise high luck dose manageable.

However, for such simple mechanics, there are lots of things to consider. By the end of the game, you have so many options it isn't that fun anymore.

The theme is also one of the most pasted-on ones I've seen. This usually doesn't bother me, but for some reason, it does bother me here.

A decent game I'd play, but not one I'd seek to play.

A game that we should detest--a far future setting that is beautiful but gives us nothing to  relate to, a weird combination of deck building, drafting and set collection, a lot of moving parts (literally), highly tactical (from what I can tell), etc.--yet improbably Ginkgopolis works really well for us. It's tense and frustrating in a very good way.

Quite refreshing mechanics for a colourful and actually abstract area majority game.  Materials are really good, and the game seems to be a bit tricky at the beggining, but plays quite fine.

Ginkgopolis wins the prize for the most unspellable game title of all time, and in the hit parade of the thin pasted-on themes could achieve at least a special mention.
But, after these (bland) negative statements... I must say that I really fell in love with this game!
It is a pleasant mix of various mechanics: tile-laying, area majority, set collection, drafting, and some more... But everything mixes in a clever way, and the game plays at a fast pace and is very enjoyable.
The production value is very high, and this doesn't hurt, of course.

Another original design from the author of Troyes and Carson City: well done monsieur Georges!

Plays fast and has a good mix of mechanisms including card drafting, tile laying, area majority, and engine building. This game also has a blend of strategy and tactics that provide for interesting game play. It simply works and is fun. Its greatness seems to be in the way it unexpectedly mixes the mechanisms together while maintaining a snappy flow to the game. As a negative, I do wish it played a bit less abstractly.  

Edit: April 2017: This rating is still good after about 6 more plays (10 or so total). I am starting to worry about the replayability of the base game. Incorporating Experts may be necessary sooner than expected.

A game that I missed completely in the lead up to Essen 2012. This was/ is because the rules weren't downloadable in English so I had no idea what it was about. 

First play: A simple game with few options each round that initially gives the impression that some strategy is possible. However by game end it became apparent that the success of a move will depend upon what other players do and what tiles you draw and what cards you are passed and draw. In fact the early moves are pretty pointless as the layers will mean that early builds are rapidly wiped out.

The nail in the coffin is the fact that a huge raft of points will be decided by the final round. I drew the cards that meant my regions stayed connected and allowed me to pinch the top stack of the second biggest region. Factors that were pure luck, out of my control that netted 30 points.

Way too random for me with no meaningful structure right up to the end.

The second game we played a bit more strategically and uncovered more of the depth of the game.  Lots of options to explore: building up vs. building out, rushing the end vs. stalling for time, playing a card you need vs. one your opponent would want.  There's a lot of fun to be had here.  I'm putting this one on my wishlist.

This one was a pleasant surprise and basically themeless, but that doesn't really matter.  At first, it sounded like a mess of mixed mechanics with card drafting, tile laying, area majority and resource/worker management (kind of). As the game progressed, I realized two important things... (1) if focused, I could make sure I was helping myself in multiple ways with each turn and (2) the board came to life with a colorful, 3 dimensional display. I liked how it worked and how it looked and it seems like it could be a good fit as a 2 player game.

I now own this game and have played it once more with 4 players and once with 2 players.  It is a quality game.  The rules seem tough for non-gamers to grasp at first, but the game doesn't feel confusing to me.  I love how the game looks on the table and look forward to more plays.

I still enjoy this game, but I'm not sure it deserves an 8 rating... maybe a 7?  We'll see with a few more plays.

A solid little game which, for some reason, took a lot of explaining. In actual fact the gameplay is fairly simple and it is reasonably balanced between points now/engine building, though the area majority scoring at the end seems to count for quite a lot. On first play it was hard to follow who was doing well and who was not, so I was quite surprised at the result. Certainly worth another play to really get the feel for it.

RATING: 8
This is a solid, more tactical than strategic game, with top notch components, great artwork and excellent use of colour. There are plenty of decisions to be made but surprisingly the game is not very prone to AP and can be easily played in a quick 40-45 minutes. Randomness is definitely present; it can be a little frustrating when the tiles you need don't come your way. This is somewhat mitigated by the special bonuses and combos offered by the various cards in front of each player. The rules and iconography take a couple of games to get used to but afterwards the game is quite easy to play. The game scales well and replay value is quite high.

Kibontás és alkatrészek:
Ezt már korábban kibontottam, de csak a kártya mérete miatt. Úgyhogy nem tudom pontosan, hogy volt a dobozában, de minden még kibontatlanul van benne.
Itt a kiadó spórolt, mert a kinyomó kartonok nem a doboz méretet képezik, ezért később doboz kitöltésre nem igazán használható. Ilyenkor vetem be más játékok kartonját, melyekre nem volt szükség a dobozban. 
Szóval ez egy olyan lötyögős doboz az igényesség teljessége nélkül. Egy szabálykönyv, majd a kartonok (2 kicsi és 4 nagy), melyek széltében és hosszában a spórolás jegyeit viselik, de hoppá a kartonok vastagsága duplája mint egy normál játék esetében. Már már azt gondolnám harcolni kell vele. Majd jönnek a játékosoknak gyártott paravánok. A tároló rekeszben összesen két dolgot találtam. Egy nagy zacskó faelemet és egy pakli kártyát.
A tároló rekesz olyan igénytelen, hogy legszívesebben kidobnám és ha nem férnek majd bele a kiegészítők, akkor az lesz a sorsa. Se grafika, se normális hajtogatás. Mindennek az alja. Pearl Games egyes alá e tekintetben.
Viszont adtak hozzá nejlon tasakokat.
A kártya lapok nagyon jó minőségűek. Mint ahogy egy kártyás játéknál lennie kell. A grafika tetszetős és a jelek egyértelműek.
A kinyomó kartonokból  nagyon könnyedén jöttek ki az elemek, első osztályú nyomdai munka. A grafika hasonló a kártyákon lévőkhöz.
Pont belefért minden a dobozba, úgyhogy panaszra nem lehet ok.

Es un juego no apto para cualquiera. Es muy abstracto. Se trata de contribuir a la construcción de una ciudad que puede crecer a lo alto o a lo ancho. En su turno, un jugador tiene dos opciones: o jugar una carta o jugar una carta y una loseta. En el primer caso se consiguen recursos. En el segundo, se puede o expandir la ciudad, obteniendo privilegios según las losetas adyacentes, o crecer a lo alto en cuyo caso te quedas la carta que se convierte en un bonus que se aplicará a tus acciones futuras.
Al final de la partida, en la ciudad se evalúan mayorías en los distritos. Es bastante caótico, en cuanto que cualquiera te puede estropear una mayoría, alterando el distrito, pero así con todo es muy cerebral y te obliga a hacer cálculos continuamente.
Es agotador.. pero a mí me gusta bastante.
Solo para jugones o acostumbrados.

This reminds me of Mexica, where you can enter any domain to alter the scoring of an area. But you are restricted in your moves by the cards you draw, which force upon you alternative decisions for your movements/actions. Well done for balance, and yes, good art work.

Only one play so far. It started slowly - as we were just trying to piece together the rules and flow. But, we were quickly able to build engines and maintain resource and tile draws whilst placing tiles on the board. I found the end-game to have some really fun tricky moves and overall it was very enjoyable. Best new game played since Castles of Burgundy and Trajan.

Extremely finicky. Lots of administration. 45 minutes of rules explanation for 45 minutes gameplay? That's a low return on investment.

Abstract mediocrity.

Feh.

Update rating from 5 to 2. Gave it a second chance and it was even worse than the first play. This piece of turd encompasses much of what is wrong with gaming today. It's absolutely soulless, abstract, tabulative and drier than the Atacama. Hard to believe that this comes from the same designer as Carson City and Troyes.

No, it's not broken, it works. But that's it.

It's one of these "I harmed/helped you by accident" games.

You try to do the best for your own and then, by accident, you help or harm other players.

Sure, near the end you could try to prevent other's from scoring. But that depends so much on the cards you get and the tiles you got and the meeples you have.

In the end, you'll look to optimize your own scoring (which depends again on the cards, the meeples, the tiles) and if you harm/help another player that's - you guessed it - by accident.

One of these games where opponents could be simulated by a "game engine" (like dice or cards). You just don't need to play with other humans. If I want to play solitaire I do so - but not in a multiplayer game!

More and more hate this kind of games.

RATING: N/A
I have not rated this game, which I feel inappropriate after a single play.  But despite the enthusiasm with which I approached it the game failed to deliver. I acknowledge that the game is totally abstract but that doesn't bother me in the slightest.  I found it enjoyable to play.  

What ruined it for me was the end-game scoring that for some players dwarfed all that had gone before.  Nick Case in his comments above covered the problem precisely.  The area scores, which determine the final ranking can change dramatically on the final turn solely due to the luck of the card deal and in no way as a result of forward planning.

But a change in the scoring method shifting the emphasis to what players do during the (quite long) game and away from that final turn could make a huge improvement.

(I have to state that I have to regard this game, as with all my games, from the standpoint of 4 or 5 players.  Sometimes games play differently, of course, with fewer numbers)

Another fantastic design by Xavier Georges! Don't let the box cover fool you, though: it's an abstract game, but a nice looking abstract game with pictures. The decisions are tough, and the gameplay is actually quite confrontational, as you build over other people's territories, usurp their majorities, and break up their territories. Deciding whether to build in a good spot, or build for an immediate payoff, or build for a special power can be excruciating. The tile-laying mechanic that brings more cards into play, which then give special abilities to their users, is ingenious, and makes this game unlike any other I know. The drafting element makes it even more unique.

This was on my wish list, but turned out quite disappointing when we played it. Very abstract, the artificial theme makes it difficult to grasp the concepts of the game mechanics.

RATING: 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At the heart of Ginkgopolis, you're managing some resources: tiles which you will want to play to the board, guys which you will need to place on those tiles to win the area majority end game scoring, and points which you'll need to win the game.  Each turn, you'll get to draft a card which allows you to obtain these items or use them.

Some cards also will give you game-long abilities as you play them, beefing up your further actions or netting you end game points.  They introduce an element of engine-building into the game, which is a mechanic I really love.  So, you can tailor your strategy to certain things based on which game-long abilities you choose to focus on.

The game combines some familiar mechanics such as area majority, tile laying, and the good ole take-a-card-and-pass-the-rest-to-the-left mechanic, and blends it into a game that feels new and different.  The only niggling issue is that the game is not at all intuitive; it takes a new player quite a while to "get it".

PROS: Area majority game that reminds me of Louis XIV.  The twist is that you can build an engine of special powers.

CONS: The card drafting mechanism is clumsy and unnecessary.  Sturcturing the deck is a fiddly and ongoing exercise.  There is no long term planning available here because there is no way to anticipate or control what your future actions are likely to be.  The point swings in the heavily-random endgame kill work that you have just completed (not quite as bad as Killer Bunnies, but unacceptable in a heavier Euro title).

Unexpectedly, the short pros list slightly outweighs the cons list making this game palatable. More plays will help by speeding up the game play.  This game is unbearable if it doesn't move quickly.

EDIT: Finally nailed down a dominant strategy and it's fairly easy to emulate. Makes the game predictive. However it took a LONG time to get here. Totally worth it.

Preliminary rating after 1 game when I was very tired and we were reading the rules at the table together. Once we started going and things clicking a little, it was quite enjoyable. I don't know if the bright colors had anything to do with it, but it felt fresh. And a nice balance of random and decisions. My only real concern right now is that you draw a bunch of tiles during the game, and higher numbers seem to be strictly better. But maybe you draw enough that it balances out.

RATING: 4
The more I play, the less I'm beginning to like Ginkgopolis. It's beginning to look like a case of a good idea looking for a good game.

Xavier Georges has a certain way of designing games I'm not always comfortable with. He likes to put a lot of 'stuff' into his designs, and that is at odds with my philosophy that 'less is more'. So when Ginkgopolis was announced for Spiel 2012, my initial response upon learning the name of the author was one of reluctance and polite ignoring. But then I learned that the game featured adjacency mechanisms/tableau building, and since I've been more or less trying out 'every' game with this pattern (there are limits), Ginkgopolis was promoted to the list of 'to play' titles. Upon playing I learnt that the subject had very little to do with the actual game, which seemed to revolve, quite abstractly, around constructing an activation engine of sorts to create districts of buildings. Players pass cards around 7 Wonders-style, and then select one, which represents one of the buildings visible from the top. They then do something to this building: overbuild it, build something next to it, activate it. These actions deliver points, tiles to build and abstracted resources needed for construction. So far so good. With experience the too long playing time started to drop, which is a good thing as the title is not meant to last well beyond an hour. I'm now at 10 to 15 minutes above its advertised length of 45 minutes, which is fine.

But what is getting to me is the futility of any decent amount of planning in this game at all player numbers. At two, the game is open and almost like a race: you can construct your activation engine the way you like it and at some point rake in points like casino chips at a winning roulette game (at either the end, or throughout the game). Many buildings get activated or built over to the point where it doesn't feel like a challenge anymore. What you need enters your hand one way or the other, there are but few chokepoints which instigate conflict between the players. At three, luck of the draw can already lock you out of a crucial object you need to build up some presence (either tiles or resources); the game does not compensate for this. And at four and five the tactics become insane. There isn't an ideal player number for the ideas behind Ginkgopolis, leading me to state that there is a good idea lurking here, but that it still needs a game to be sufficiently interesting.

Mostly I blame the mechanism of the card draft. It is too random and too uncontrolled, too much 'make the most of what you're given'. That is not necessarily a bad idea: many games manage just fine. But these games will give you a lot of moves in between in order for a shortage to cancel out, or provide some benefit in having a surplus of one resource. Not so Ginkgopolis: the game is short and fairly quick, combined with the drafting makes the whole come apart at the seams for the tension this creates. At the low player number end the game tries to simulate a shortage by having the gamers remove cards and tiles, but these steps just add more uncertainty instead of what the game needs: [i]control[/i]! There is no recipe to working around an engine which is difficult to rev up save for not getting one in the first place. In theory it is quite imaginable to improve a rotten engine by simply exchanging a few cards, or adding a few. But the problem is that it requires [i]specific[/i] cards, and the draft doesn't guarantee you will get these. If you don't and someone else [i]does[/i] (which is even worse), Ginkgopolis ends there and then for you. Adding insult to injury, the draft offloads getting rid of a bad hand to a single player who incurs a penalty while likely improving the hand for his fellow players as well. In a lot of cases stopping someone else will be actively detrimental towards your own game, and if the group as a whole does not play that way, you are damned if you do, and damned if you don't. (Granted, not a problem with the game persé, but still the game allows such a nasty side to show.) 

I'm going to slowy forget about this title in the hope that by the time it reappears on the table there have been developments or strategy guides which show me to be all wrong in my analysis. I'd be quite curious to learn how matters would improve then.

[b]Update[/b] I sold this game off after having given the topological variants a go. They improve matters a little, but I also learnt that there was an unaddressed problem with the starting cards as I had noticed purely by coincidence that getting a bad hand here dooms your engine right from the start. In the end I was just fed up with this offering: there were too many things slightly wrong with it. And so it went off in search of a better home.

Components: Cute artwork; similar in style to Metropolis. I particularly like that so many of the buildings are different, even if only slightly so. The character cards are great. Very quickly the theme bleeds away and it's just about moving cubes around, but I appreciate the effort.

Experience: Fun mechanisms intersecting. The rotating hand, from a deck that gets regular upgrades; playing a card and being rewarded more and more as the game goes on; and trying to fight for specific areas of the board. There's just enough types of scoring that players might be able to specialize and still hope to win.

Definitely a favourite of ours.  It's abstract, but not too abstract.  It's got a nice theme of building, and it's layered over a tense area control and engine building game.  You have to build smartly to control areas, but you also need to build a good engine while doing so.  If not, you sputter out mid game and lose ground with no bonuses.

I nearly won the first time I played, but still did not enjoy it enough to want to try again. This game was so soulless. I don't expect everyone to agree that this game is not fun but just a pure exercise in mechanics (just as I expect many people to be wrong in life).

I won't lie, there's so much to the mechanics and iconography of this game that now I don't remember at all how to play. But I know it involved drawing some tiles and cards somewhat randomly and drafting them semi-blindly to try and maximize your score but not knowing how your opponents would inevitably accidentally mess with you to prevent you from fully planning before your turn.

RATING: 7
Players are urban developers, designing and expanding a futuristic green city.  Simple game, almost sitting in the super filler category, where players slap down a card, reveal and action it.  Cards relate to an action being taken with a building on the board, or a planning site adjacent to the board (the board representing a city of adjacent building tiles).  Actions are either exploit (take VP, building tiles, or resources, depending on the building actioned), expand (add a tile to the city) or upgrade (build over an existing building, making it more powerful to exploit).  Upgrading adds the played card to your tableau, allowing you to gain more stuff if you take the corresponding actions, so players get more powerful and the game accelerates nicely.

The game ends when all the tiles are exhausted, or when someone has used up all their resources.  Then a simple majority system of victory points are awarded out for districts of the city where players are present. 

Simple game to teach - very easy to pick up and play, but offers a nice thinky challenge without overdoing it.  I liked this one a lot.

RATING: 8
Very solid mid-weight Euro.  Totally themeless, and you could argue that the attempt to theme it hurts more than helps.  But that's okay, this is one of those games where it can stand on it's own abstract rules.   You are using cards and tiles to build a city upwards and outwards.   You have a tableau of bonus abilities, and each round you have to do the best you can with a very small hand of cards.   In that way, it feels a lot like La Isla to me.   Not sure that I have to own it, but it is certainly a title that I would play some more.   Enjoyed the flow of it and the thinky elements.   I don't think 45 minutes is a fair time to put on the box.  75-90 minutes.

Only after my 2nd play, I find this game to be entertaining. My first play left me lost and confused ALL the time (Note that the person who taught me the game did a good job in teaching the game, it was me who didn't grab the rule very well).

Very simple game but steep learning curve (to learn when someone teaches it to you, also it's a difficult game to teach and let people understand) I'd say. Once you wrap your head around the 3 basic actions you can do, everything will go real easy and smooth from that point on. 

I like the city building aspect, where you're trying to build, improve and take over districts. As the game progresses, your basic actions improved (this is done when you do building action) and become better. I like how the starting 3x3 grid of the city grows throughout the play, you get that nice 3D spatial element near game end.

I can see myself becoming better over repeated plays.

Whoa!  Tableau building, tile placement, card drafting, deck building, area majority game.  It's awesome! 

The game has a lot of stuff moving around each turn though, so be warned.  I generally knock games down a peg or five for fiddliness, but I really love this one.  It's a head to head (to head to head) brain burner that requires you to get in each others' faces.  The super cool thing about this game is that when an opponent knocks you back, they might also be setting you up, as you can usually build on top of whatever they did.

Once everyone knows what they're doing and doesn't AP, it plays relatively quickly, even with five. Everything in the game works well, making it a solid design. Although it's good enough to keep, it doesn't seem to be good enough to play often. Somewhat forgettable.

RATING: 7
Ginkgopolis is a mish-mash of multiple games in a similar way that Eminent Domain is.  This particular title fuses:

7 Wonders: Drafting cards and handing them to neighbors.  Cards add scoring opportunities and others provide resources.

Carcassonne: Tile drawing and tile-based area control.

Taluva: Direct interaction of being able to build over your opponents.

This game does have a lot of mechanics found in other games, but fuses them in what I consider to be a more interesting way than the other games it's borrowing from, unlike Eminent Domain.  The draft asks many questions to the players:

Do you want scoring card opportunities?
Do you want resource/tile/vp acquisition right now?
Do you want to speed up your acquisitions in the future?
Do you want to grow your area majority?
Do you want to impede the other players area majority?
Do you want to add these scoring cards to the game?
Do you want to speed up the game tempo?
How do the cards you will pass help the opponent regarding all of the previous questions?

The only minor gripes I have about the game for the time being, is that it should have had player references for the iconography and how the abilities coincide with specific numbers among the 3 different colored decks.

There was a point during Ginko when I looked at the board and realized it looked just like a picture on BGG I had seen where I thought, "Oh, geez, this is JUST the type of game I know I don't like." Turns out it was this very game. 

Oh, it's very clever with how the game pulls you in different directions in terms of territory and cards you see/pass but it falls into some category in my brain  where this is quite simply: work/not fun. I just don't find the questions the game is asking me to be interesting to answer; they're laborious.  My brain felt soggy. I think it's because the game is very tactical with a very narrow space for forward planning. You throw stuff against the wall and hope enough sticks.

I just have an overwhelmingly pleasant feeling when playing the game.  Only thing I can say negative is that it'll probably feel pretty samey after awhile since there are only three different types of tiles and so many of the rewards, but it is somewhere on the lighter end of a medium weight game so that's not a big deal to me.

This game has all the three mechanisms I like the most: Area control, engine builder and card drafting. What's not to like?
Well, there is a couple of things. First, it's a little too fiddly for my taste. Also, it's maybe a little too easy to destroy regions at the end of the game.
However, there is tension all the way, and the general experience is very good. Look forward to trying it again.

First of all: I love city building games. So i realy enjoyed this one. It's very hard to understand and our first gameplay lasts kind of 2h cause of difficult rules.

Later games are much more fluently in playing.

[b]A quintessential Feldian peuro, incredibly well-designed, that will greatly please euro gamers and will greatly disgust theme gamers. Dry as a bone.[/b]

1st play: DEC/14. When Clive suggested we play this, I look at some pictures online and felt a bit sick: wooden resource barrels and tons of iconography...gaaaaah! A peuro! Run away! Then I saw the ranking (mid-200's) and the play time (45 mins) and thought I should at least give it a try. I saw down and saw Xavier Georges name on the box and regretted agreeing to this. (I hated Carson City.)

Fast forward 60 minutes: the game was hard to grasp at first (the different functions of the cards were hard for me to grasp at first), but I have to admit that as far as pure euros go, this is one of the better desgins. Lots of ways to use the cards, which means lots of ways to play cleverly. Several (ostensibly) viable victory paths; clever deck-seeding mechanic; lots of things to consider when making plays. Games like this and Castles of Burgundy are the best examples of light-middleweight euro design. I like my euros short and sweet. Still, lacking theme, this only rates 2 stars for me.

[b]2nd play[/b]: Credit where credit is due: this game is original enough that it is fairly tricky to learn. I had to re-learn it last night. Brilliant design married to terrible graphic design. AUG 15

Unlike any other game I have played. Plays incredibly smooth and has some very nice depth to it.

Great depth to complexity ratio.

RATING: 8
It is a neat, engaging, appealing design and it might be a game more strategic that it not seems at first sight --the first time, it looks like a luck fest, a tactical and chaotic game.

Like in Troyes and Tournay, there are 3 colours with pros and cons, bringing decision to the game :

- red buildings allow you to gain resources (wooden cylinders) required to put tiles in play. Resources are needed to expand the town but also to build taller buildings. Taller buildings requires lots of resources but can generate lots of resources/tiles/VP and helps toward end game scoring (majorities). Having a lot of resources means that you are able to break/grab an important district for end game scoring.

- blue buildings allow you to gain new tiles from the supply and brings you some flexibility because there is some malus if you don't respect the tile placement (same colour, increasing number). Having a lot of tiles means that you are able to adapt yourself to changing game state.

- yellow buildings allow you to earn VP. This is certainely the less important aspect to focus early on because it is not an endgame condition and it doesn't meet your needs to expand the city. But this is certainely a way to explore.

So it is first an engine building game. The goal is to build a resources/tiles/VP engine before thinking to end game scoring for majorities. Why ? Because expanding the town upward or wider consume tiles and resources. If you don't have bonus to generate some tiles/resources :
1) you will have to take suboptimal actions to recover and you will lose time as a result.
2) you will have lesser and lesser flexibility and you certainely won't be able to fight for area majorities at the end of the game.

With flexibility, you will less suffer the luck of draw and you will be able to adapt yourself to the ever changing board status and majorities.

RATING: 8
Game feels like nothing else I've played before, which I love. The mechanism is very well oiled and everything works together very well. It's reminiscent of acquire with some aspects of Taluva as scoring regions dynamically change. The biggest drawback might be the luck-of-the-draw for tiles. Drawing large numbered tiles is a huge advantage. Also, it's a bit fiddly.

What may turn people away from this game is the original nature of the game play: face down cards with or without tiles will indicate one of the four possible move. It makes it hard for newcomer to boardgames to pick it up because you can't really help them. As a result you'll very likely get a couple of "take backs" as players do something they weren't allowed to play.

I would side with those who say the game has a surprising level of complexity for so short a game but I don't mean it in a good way.

Gameplay is almost entirely tactical with very few opportunities for foward planning. The 7 Wonders-style card draft is unnecessary and has probably been included only because it's currently hip to have one. You could simply draw a new hand each turn and I doubt you would notice the difference (2p games possibly excepted).

Of all the non-10 games I've played at his point, I think Ginkgopolis is one that I would like to play the most. There is an aspect of randomness to the cards and tiles, however the drafting mechanic of the turn and the area control aspect of the building actions really make it a unique gameplay experience. Once I figure out a good way to actually teach the game (haven't found one yet, the abstract aspects of the game make it hard for me to describe and explain), I will hopefully get to play it a great deal.

There is nothing especially innovative about Ginkgopolis, but it still manages to be a very well balanced and impressive game. The simultaneous card selection and narrow choice of actions means that the game flows smoothly. Having to add new building cards to the deck on a regular basis is the only element that breaks the flow, but with a bit of teamwork it can be handled relatively painlessly. Innovation can easily become a short lived novelty, but crafting together standard mechanisms in clever and intriguing ways is something that Xavier has done here superbly well.

Elegant mechanisms and while the artwork and theme are pretty they aren't very captivating.  Would love to see the cards, wooden pieces, and tile artwork upgraded to bring the theme home a little more, not change it though.. I like it and the color palette.  (Like Race for the Galaxy has no theme really but the artwork is so immersive you can imagine the worlds in each card.. this game deserves that type of artwork!)

Mechanically, the game is fluid and smooth.  Engine building early and vp generating at the right time is fun and always difficult to master as what your opponent(s) are doing is important.

She liked it but nothing special(What?!?) so I sold it where it will be truly appreciated, I hope.  If it comes back into print I will try again, especially if they add immersive artwork along the same theme.  The cover draws you in, but after that..

Very solid game and I can see why [geekurl=/user/punkin312]punkin312[/geekurl], et al, adore this one.  I will miss it...

Structured elegantly, if a bit non-intuitively (in fact downright opaque to teach), with plenty to think about in this interesting resource management and area control game.  The theme does not add much (futuristic buildings?) and don't help the teaching much, but the mechanisms are actually logical and well done.  Can be hard to see what strategy to follow, or even how possible it is to follow a strategy.  Keen to explore more.

During the first play, my wife found it rather confusing, but after a short while it clicked and the icons and game play began to make sense. A brilliant design that plays smoothly.

Ginkgopolis is excellent. Every action you take has implications for the rest of the game and I LOVE this, as it makes every action you make feel important. The card-play provides a lot of room to tinker around with fun strategies. The game can become quite cumbersome as cards fill the table and you must add and re-shuffle cards in the deck several times during a game, but that is not so much a complaint as it is a caveat.

Ginkgopolis is a wonderful mashup of mechanisms. It's got drafting, engine building, tile laying, area majority and deckbuilding in every round! It's amazing how it all flows. 

I'm very glad there's a solo variant where I could learn it first.

The theme isn't very relevant while playing but it's definitely unique and it brings in a wonderful art direction.

Clever. Clever clever clever. You constantly have too few resources but still too many options.

The area-control scoring on the board itself makes it possible for people who've played before to take advantage of new players that don't have a sense for how soon the game will end. But the whole thing is peculiar enough that a lot of it doesn't click until after the first game.

One of the greatest strengths of Ginkgopolis is that it is different.  Yes, it has elements of tile and worker placement, card management and area control, familiar mechanisms that we have all seen used many, many times.  However, the manner in which they are assembled gives the game a fresh and unique feel.  It doesn’t really feel like any other game.

Después de varias partidas es un juego que me gusta mucho, muy táctico pero a la vez que lo vas conociendo se vuelve mas y mas estratégico, muy exigente a la hora de planificar estrategias ya que tienes que conocer perfectamente como se puntúa al final del juego para sacarle partido al desarrollo de la partida.

Ginkgopolis es un juego sencillo que cuesta entender, un abstracto de control de áreas con un tema pegado, se juega rápido, tiene tensión y ofrece oportunidades de tomar decisiones sin volverte loco o llegar a saturar.

En el tema negativo decir que el juego puede jugártela con el azar, que la burocracia o mantenimiento del juego es un poco coñazo y que el juego no deja de ser un abstracto con un tema pegadísimo.

Aun así hay que darle oportunidades para descubrir el gran juego que se encuentra detrás.

It's probably longer than it ought to be for more than two (three quick players at the outside), but it's awfully clever and fun. 
[EDIT] Actually, my worry over length was overblown--I have not found Ginkgopolis to overstay its welcome. The engine-building is smooth and fun and executed in a novel way. This game is a real winner.

Clever and interesting game, but I'm not sure if the luck of the draw can dictate your game. If you don't get cards that lets you produce resources, you are pretty much out of the game. That's just what happened to me.

Joc abstracte de col·locació de losetes, moltes possibilitats de combos. Utilitza un mecanisme de draft per repartir les cartes entre jugadors.

El atzar que introdueix el draft potser és massa elevat.

Actualització després de més partides: l'atzar del draft es corregeix amb una regla opcional (de les tres cartes, n'esculls una per jugar, un altre per quedarte i passes la resta). El que em segueix sense convencer del joc és com s'acaba, tornant les losetes al suministre general, i que afegeix un o dos torns més màxim, ja que tothom té combos molt bons. Si no fos per això, em semblaria un joc genial.

Very innovative: it's a fantastic mix of resource management (i.e., energy and tiles), area majority, tableau building, as well as 3 dimensional playing field. One could say that Gingkopolis is the love child of Louis XIV and Taluva - and that this 'definition' would still not account for its own rebellious, yet clean cut, emergent personality. Great mix that feels fresh, concise, concrete, aesthetically immersive, and it does it all within a reasonable time-frame. It could be argued that the game's theme is 'weak,' but I'm not sure that 'dripping with theme' was ever an objective that was sought out for this mechanical masterpiece.

Super quirky in theme and execution. It has some card drafting, tile laying, resource collecting, and area majorities. Long-term planning seems quite limited. There's some fiddly deck maintenance. Not bad by any means, but weird. I might give it another try, but then, I might not.

(06/01/2015) Comment based on 10 plays.

A quick, but substantially satisfying building/area majority/card drafting civ-lite game, that plays in 45 minutes, and scales wonderfully from 2 to 5 players, with seemingly no increase in downtime.

Pearl Games, recently acquired by Asmondee Games, has come out with a string of hits in the past several years: Troyes, Deus, and Ginkgopolis. If one is willing to look into the genealogy of these games, one will find that Troyes was designed by a team of three designers. One of the designers, Sébastien Dujardin, designed the recent Deus, which is currently a huge success in our group, racking up a staggering 32+ plays in a matter of three months. Xavier Georges, one of the other two designers in the team, designed Ginkgopolis, a game which is now experiencing heavy rotation in my group. The reason is thoughtful, interesting, and meaningful gameplay that plays quickly, and plays well at any player count. The same can be said of Deus, and it may not be too much of a stretch to suggest that the DNA of Troyes has rubbed off on both Ginkgopolis and Deus. I haven't played Troyes, but based on the designers alone and their approach to game design, is enough to make me want to seek out and get a copy for myself.

Ginkgopolis centers around building tiles of three types: red (resource), blue (tile), and yellow ("success points" or VP). There are 20 tiles within each type, ranked from 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest. There are "building" cards associated with each of these tiles, but ranks 4 to 20 are initially out of play. The board starts out with a 3x3 grid of randomly arranged tiles of the three types, rank 1 to 3 within each type. There are also a series of letter counters from "A" to "L" arranged clockwise on the periphery of the 3x3 grid, with each letter orthogonal to one tile in the grid and orthogonal to each other. A starting deck of the 9 cards representing the grid, and 12 cards, each with a letter representing "urbanization", is formed. A hand of four cards is dealt to each player.

Each turn, players secretly and simultaneously select one card from a hand of four, and then "pass the trash" to the player to their left. The card selected will determine what action they will be executing in the current turn, which is resolved in turn order: 1) A player can play an urbanization card to get either a resource or a tile; 2) A building card can be played to get resources/tiles/VP equal to the level of the building on the board; 3) An urbanization card can be played with a tile to expand outwards from the periphery of the initial 3x3 grid, and getting resources/tiles/VP equal to the level of any orthogonal buildings adjacent to the new tile placement; or 4) A building card can be played with a tile to overbuild on top of an existing building. Players then get any end turn bonuses, depending on whether they played a card, urbanized, or overbuilt a tile. If just a card or urbanization, the card is discarded. However, if a building is overbuilt, the player gets to keep the associated building card that was used to trigger the overbuilding--the card will have an end turn bonus that can be exploited next turn, or it may have end game scoring bonuses.

Players are trying to get area majority within "districts", which are defined as any two or more red/blue/yellow tiles that are orthogonally connected. Tiles can be stacked on one another to form taller buildings. Players mark ownership of specific building tiles with their own colored "resource" markers, with one marker for a Level-1 building, two markers for a Level-2 building, and so forth for successively taller buildings. Each district is scored at the end of the game, where the VP is equal to the total number of all resource markers of all the players within the district, going to the player with the most resources in that district. The player with the second most resources gets VP equal to their own number.

The three cards passed from the right player are supplemented with another card from the deck. Turns continue until the deck runs out, where a new deck is formed from the discards, and cards associated with tiles that have overbuilt other tiles in the current round are inserted in. This means that there is a possibility that a higher-level building can be overbuilt, provided the player has the associated building card.

In this manner, the building tiles of the initial 3x3 grid are overbuilt with additional tiles representing taller buildings, and additional buildings begin to sprout along the periphery. The game is fascinating to watch as the buildings rise "upward" and flow "outward", with the composition and ownership of the districts changing with every turn. The players are posed with interesting choices in their card play, whether to get more resources and/or tiles, or deciding to urbanize or overbuild. There is the matter of denying the left-hand player a juicy card or two versus one's more immediate needs or long-term motivations. While there is a bit more randomness due to how the cards are dealt, each player has two once-in-a-game opportunities to exchange their hand for a new one. Other than that, skilled players will generally tend to do better than new comers.

The rules took several readings, but there was never an "Aha!" moment. This does not mean the rules were poorly written. On the contrary, the game concepts are novel and intricately developed such that one must simply play the game to "get it". It took our group half-way through the game to understand how the game is supposed to work, and even then, we had missed a number of minor rules. The player aid on the back of each player's shield is initially useless, as it will take a while to decipher and understand the Eurospeak icons. The custom-made player aids in the forum are also not useable--simply photocopying the last two pages of the rule book was enough to make for a useable player aid.

This game, like its other Pearl Game cousin, Deus, is a sheer delight to play. There are agonizing decisions every turn, but not so much to induce AP. Play is fluid, smooth, and quick, with very little downtime; everyone is engaged throughout the game. The rules are well written, and the components are top-notch. The fact that it handles 2 to 5 players nicely, with no discernable impact on downtime or play length at 45 minutes is admirable. Admittedly, the game feels somewhat different at different player counts, but this is more of a positive than a liability. It also feels more of an abstract that a well-themed civ-lite game, but this can be easily overlooked because of its enjoyable gameplay. Based on this and Deus, I will be seeking out more games from Georges and Dujardin, as they seem to know what makes a game fun and meaningful. Ginkgopolis is a solid "8".

Update (10/27/2015) 16+ plays.

This has effectively replaced Deus as our quick go-to game. More than a filler, but not enough to be the main course; more like an after dinner desert. Like Deus, sometimes it is the cards (and the tiles) that makes you look like a genius, while other times the game will deal you dreck. There are so many places where your game could have wandered off, that I sometimes wonder if the game is really playing me, instead of me playing it. Yes, I feel like that boat on the river with the currents taking me wherever. I have a sense of agency, and yet, the game is so swingy that maybe I have very little to do with it--I don't know. Then, there are games where I feel like I was in complete control and knew what I was doing. This is going to take awhile to figure out. Still a solid "8". I don't think it will be a "9", but it is still a fantastic game. Never would I have envisioned such a design. Sheer genius.

RATING: 9
When I first started playing Ginkgopolis, I thought it was a good game, but a little random.  After several plays I finally realized that I was approaching it all wrong - I wasn't planning ahead enough, and would play cards that gave me mediocre turns and then be left without resources (or tiles) to play exceptional turns.  If your hand is only so-so, just Exploit, and bide your time.  This overcomes quite a lot of the randomness.  That's not to say there isn't still a strong random element in Ginkgopolis, but it's a much better game than I'd initially thought, and it's become a real favorite of mine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like how everything is interrelated and I like area control.  I don't usually like drafting but I could put up with it here.  Also, there was a bit of fiddlyness with cards & bits all over the place.

The constant flow of points & tiles & resources makes it a bit loose & hard to know who's winning & I imagine this would be very chaotic with more than 3 players.  I usually prefer games that are a bit tighter.

Also, the theme is quite weak.

Overall, there's an element of it being a "card game" which I don't love but it's complex enough that I think it will get played quite a bit by us, especially as a 3 player.

A bit more chaotic than I'd like with 5, but I'll play with any player count.

A card drafting, engine building, tile placing game that might not click the first time you play. Very nice system of adding cards into circulation as the corresponding tile is built and removing cards from circulation as the corresponding tile is covered.

RATING: 7
This is really clever! It's a fairly light tile-laying game in which laying a tile has several implications; it may give you a bonus later, or help you to get a majority in an area, or help you get resources now. There's a balancing act between them, but you get some cards in the beginning to give you a clue which way to go. I liked it quite a bit, but then, I'd like any game in which the victory tokens are gingko leaves... (1 play)

The tension between strategic depth and tactical complexity has proven to be exhilarating, punctuated by the almost unbearable anticipation of an area control conflict and resolution phase that accelerates relentlessly during the end game

I created [thread=971854][/thread], which solved any issues that I had with the game.

Updated 2013.08: Downgraded to 9, due to excessive chaos in games with more than 2 players. 

Updated again to 8.5 to bring in balance with my other game ratings. May raise back up to 9 with expansion. Must play more to decide. 

Final rating for now remains 8.5. I do not mind the flip flop of control in the endgame at all, but my gaming tastes are growing towards deep and more epic games.

RATING: 8
Really solid area control game where your actions can not only alter the amount of control you have in a particular region, but also merge or split different existing regions. Therefore there is some opportunity for some really big plays of cutting someone's district in half in a way that you gain control of the larger, more valuable district and your opponent controls a much weaker one. The problem is that the places you can build on to change the board are dependent on the cards you have. So usually the place to go to make such a big play is obvious, it's just a matter if you get to see the card for it. There is also a system of collecting cards that give bonus resources for certain actions, and so being able to build up these bonuses and get to the point where your actions are really powerful is fun. In general most actions do multiple things, and I'm a bit of a sucker for that in games.

Iniital Rating: 7.5 (February 2017)

I finally managed to get Ginkgopolis to the table! I have previously played it twice online but, as I play by turns, I never understood it correctly. 

The rules of the game aren’t complex, but, for some reason, I could never understood them perfectly from the rulebook. I think it could be a lot clearer with better examples, perhaps it uses heavy language to explain simple concepts. To summarize, I don’t know why I didn’t understand the rules clearly from the rulebook as I do with most games, but once you understand the rules, you can explain them under 17 minutes. Playtime is also fast, perhaps under an hour with fast players.

My desire to play the game was very high as it is a Xavier Georges´ design and I really love Troyes and like Carson City.

The game´s components are ok as is the art.

The theme is also ok, nothing exciting and you don’t feel it very much through the game, it is almost an abstract game. I dislike the name of the game, but (obviously), this is a minor issue for me.

Ginkgopolis has a mix of area control with drafting. The game´s decisions are very interesting! On one hand you have the tiles that allow you to strategize and form a long term plan. On the other hand you get every turn a new set of cards so thinking the better way to play them is very tactical and fun. The decision aren’t obvious in any way (which card should I play? Should I replace my hand? should I play a card with a tile or without a tile, which tile should I play? should I try to get the majority in a district?),

I think it plays better with three players. I will play with any configuration but one. With higher number of players you have much less control. I need to see if this is an issue for me.

Ginkgopolis is a novel and unique game, it feels very different from any other game in my collection and that’s appreciated.

On the bad side, the game is very expensive and now that I liked it, I must have the expansion which is also very expensive. I hope they reprint it soon. Luck plays a minor role in the game and there are ways to mitigate it, so it doesn’t bother me much. 

Bottom line, Ginkgopolis is a good game with the perfect mix of strategy and tactics. It plays very fast for a game this deep and it is also an unique game. A keeper in my game collection.

2017-02-13 - I've played this 2 times with 2 players, and I enjoyed it. It's pretty simple on the rules side, but it does have some depth. The game is almost abstract, which is a little off-putting. If there's ever a reprint or an opportunity to trade for it, I might pick it up, but I've decided not to go to the trouble of ordering it from overseas.

2017-07-10 - I had the opportunity to play this again recently, and I realized that I just really didn't want to. I think maybe it's just too abstract for me, as when I think about it now, there's just no aspect of it that I can latch onto to get myself interested.

As themes and mechanics seem to get better and better integrated as a whole, Ginkgopolis is a true throw back where the game was built and play-tested and then a very weak brainstorming session produced a theme that is not only disconnected, but makes absolutely no sense.

That said, the mechanics for this one are a lot of fun. You pass your hand to the left each turn, however you usually have a few good play options, even if none of them are the ideal choice. Strategic control of the game is fairly weak, but there are deeply tactical decisions that influence end-game scoring, or other player's choices. A great game of opportunistic play, if you enjoy that sort of thing. I do.

The game is hard to teach, even though the rules are pretty short. All the pieces fit together pretty intricately, which is where the difficulty comes in. Even if you teach the mechanics well, it will take a full game to grasp the implications. Georges is getting more and more impressive as a designer. While I think his early titles were mediocre, Troyes and Ginkgopolis indicate more great games to come. Be on the lookout. I agree with those that say 2-3 is the ideal player count for this.

First thing I thought of was 7 Wonders. Similiar quality and similiar card drafting mechanism.

I had no sense of direction at the beginning. I couldn't figure out what I should do for the first half of the game. Eventually it became apparent that card synergy was very important. Getting multiple rewards for a single action gives you more options when maximizing area control.

I'm not sure how I feel about this game. The mechanics are nifty, but I'm not sure how much luck plays a role. Need to play again.

I didn't love my first few plays of this game but every game I have played of this has been more compelling and interesting then the one before it! I have yet to show it to someone who doesn't like it. Every mechanic is so tightly woven that it absolutely boggles the mind how the designer managed to create this masterpiece. There's tons of replay value as your strategy needs to change on the fly. Yes it could use a little variety after all these plays but hey there's an expansion coming out very soon that looks delicious! Tight beautifully designed euro, just what I like!

Players develop a city where each building basically grants VP's, other building tiles or resources. Each turn, all players simultaneously select one out of their four cards to perform one of three actions: plan (use a building or building spot), urbanize new areas, overbuild existing buildings. Beside direct scoring of VP's, players can gather VP's via building up their own tableau of scoring cards (the cards of overbuilt buildings) or by majority scoring of areas in the city.
Ginkgopolis is very non-intuitive and mechanistic. This makes it a hard sell for everybody except the hardened eurogamer. It doesn't help that the spatial city building part is conflict-heavy which probably aided its rather positive reception on BGG. It didn't make too much of a splash on this side of the pond though. I like the combination of simultaneous action selection and multidimensional gameplay including a spatial component but I doubt that it will have much longevity. Georges' second best title so far behind Troyes. His other three designs Royal Palace, Carson City and Tournay all have fallen through with me.

I originally had little interest for Ginkgopolis because of fuzzy rules and after playing it I think it's mechanically fresh and it works, but it feels a bit forced. The game also requires a surprising amount of maintenance between rounds. The futuristic Soviet wonderland looks are colorful and pretty, but not that easy for eyes, especially when you add all the resources on top of tiles.

Love everything about this: simple resource management, solid engine building, drafting coupled with area control, areas which the players themselves define. This is awesome, easily one of my favorite games ever with 2 or 3. More than that makes it pure chaos.

The tiles are the board, which is a plus. There are special ability cards, which is also a plus and lets you do stacking/card-engine stuff if you have a mind to. There's never a feeling of being too far behind to do anything useful; you always have choices and can make plans. This and [thing=23730][/thing] are the two little-known games that pack a pleasant punch.

This game from the designer of Troyes has quickly rocketed up my all-time game rankings (in my Top 10 now), clocks in at about 75 minutes with 3 players. Really interesting gameplay that combines engine building with area control and card drafting. You select your actions simultaneously so downtime is not much of an issue, the gameplay is smooth and the game always seems to last the right amount of time for the weight. The only negative is that it is a bit hard to teach, but having some player aids printed off from BGG really help in that regard.

First game - two players. Doesn't feel like any other game we have. It took at least half of the game to become comfortable with the steps to follow for each of the three card playing actions. It did become more natural in the latter part of the game. I'm sure we'll feel better with it the next time we play.
However the deck of cards seemed to run out completely as we neared the end. I'm hoping my post in the rules forum helps us fix the problem. 
UPDATE Sure enough - we REMOVED cards instead of putting them in the discard pile. Correcting that will change things for the better.

Card drafting, City building and special workers are all big pluses for this game. The ability to build over buildings and alter end game scoring may take a while to fully grasp.

Area control game with a prevailing dominant strategy in my opinion. The spatial aspect of this game is unique, in that you get to see the board come alive, however the 3 plays of this game I have been included in have devolved into drafting synergistic victory point building engine. Willing to play more games, as it is fine fun.

Substantially better with fewer players (ie. 3 players).  At 5 players this game is random nonsense.  At 3 players there is some control over one's destiny.  Building up though is so much more awesome than building out, and cards that support that are likewise better.

I think I will like it most as a 2 or 3 player game.

My main concern, after playing some games with cool components and racing games, is that this is a very dry themeless game.  Furthermore luck of the draw is worse than german railways. 
The end game conditions with extra scoring for giving some tiles back ... well i don't know what to make of that. In our game it didn't make a difference.

I'm not sure why I never get the level of satisfaction from Xavier Georges's games I'd like to but they always feel a bit too fiddly (?) for what they are. They have maybe one too many mechanism idea added to the mix and the end result somehow feels like less than the sum of its parts. I had the same feeling with Ginkgopolis which is quite the type of game I should like but for some reason it still didn't click as much as I hoped. Maybe if it had hand management instead of handing over the rest of your hand to the next player (which made planning... "hard"). Or maybe if it didn't include this kind of common deck building part which made the game have a forced break time after time, trying to find out if we missed to put a grey marker on each new building (level), hopefully adding all the necessary cards to the mix, reshuffling the deck... I don't know... But this game feels like it would work better online (and even then, it could be simplified for its own good).

And ok game with lots being determined in the final turns and lots of the player interaction being mostly accidental because its highly determined by a fairly rigid and random hand of cards.  The mulligan tokens are a direct band-aid to this but do not suffice.  As a house rule, I'd consider allowing anyone who play a "naked card" (by itself, without a tile) to also discard one more and get 2 at the beginning of next round.  It's also fairly hard to "read" who's winning which isn't great in a game where you are supposed to impact other players.  The theme is very poorly tacked on, making it quite abstract and not supporting play.  May be better with less than 5 players as there is less chaos.  On the upside, it's fast and has ok richness for the length.

This one continues to grow on me as I play.  There is no reason not to start with the character card draft right out of the gate if the game is explained well.  Still exploring how to play well in this one - find the three actions interesting in how each one works quite differently.  Forget the theme in this game - this is really a dressed up abstract with the randomness of the cards mixed in to add some uncertainty.  Do watch region scoring at the end of the game - the end game region scoring can be quite significant and can be a nasty surprise if one forgets how those regions score.  Likely best with 3 and works fine with 4.  Five player is not a great way to learn the game and lessens control significantly.

Furchtbare Ikonografie, aber das Spiel selbst ist super!
Es wird gedraftet. aus der Hand sucht man sich eine Karte die gespielt wird. Beginnend beim Startspieler decken alle ihre gewählte Karte auf. Entweder man erhällt einfach nur Ressourcen und die Karte kommt aus dem Spiel oder man darf mit den Karten neue Plättchen legen, was Ressourcen kostet. Beim Überbauen von bereits existierenden Plättchen bekommt man dauerhafte Vorteile, was aber auch sehr teuer sein kann.
Es herrt ein dauerhafter Mangel an Plättchen oder an Ressourcen. Meine Mitspieler hatten immer genug Ressourcen, die es mir mangelte. Ich hatte Plättchen "on mass", die ihnen dafür fehlten.
Ein furchtbar tolles Spiel.

Mir gefällt das Grundspiel sehr gut, die Erweiterung ist okay, aber ohne spiele ich es lieber und mir hat es zu zweit (vielleicht zu dritt) echt mehr gefallen als zu viert (geschweige zu fünft).

I've been looking for a good city-building game for some time. This isn't it, however, because the "city-building" part is kind of weak, but the game itself is pretty good.

I didn't do that great in my play, but I know what I'd change to hopefully do better next time.

I take back my earlier reservations of this game for two players: It actually works great with two players. 

It has a very nice engine-building aspect since your actions get more and more powerful as you build new tiles. The game has a very neat structure, with the deck being re-generated as new tiles are built up and cards removed from the deck.

The in-game points and end-of-game bonuses make it so majorities isn't what it's all about.

A very interesting Euro (fairly themeless). I am definitely a little better at this one because it has a spacial aspect to it. I have only played it 2 player so unsure how it works with more.

Very simple yet deep, interactive and also fast, which might make it a go to game.

I agree with a lot of the other comments here with a 5 and 4 rating.  The game can really come down to getting the right card at the right time.

I typically prefer strategic games where I can plan long term.

RATING: 7
many decisions to take in a short time 
perfect level of interaction - not at all multiplier solitaire
+ nice strategical challenge  : are you trying to get a long term end game bonus with placing more floors or do you want to acquire VP  ASAP ?
+ start - middle - endgame strategy 
+ the game goal shifts with different player counts ; the more players, the more the end game bonus goals are important. 
+ good game variety : the goal shifts with different majority of buildings ; you have to adapt your plans according to the majority a specific type of buildings  
- sometimes  you have a bad set of cards ; but you can always use your 'joker' card
- too less control towards the endgame
Nevertheless, from designing perspective, I consider this game a jewel : congratulations for the designer !

Played once (plus a bunch of times online). On the one hand a quite elegant ruleset, on the other hand rather fiddly components-wise.

This one took several plays to click with me.  Need to play a few more times, but I think it may end up being a keeper.

Update after 15 plays:  I find the 10-15 play range for Euros to be where I'm either really enjoying my plays and want more or it's time for the game to move on.  For Ginkgopolis, I'm still enjoying my plays and haven't tired of it.  Maybe because the game play hasn't been done over and over in other games?  It's not going to get a ton of plays per year, but I expect each play to continue to bring something interesting to the table.

One of the most beautiful games on the table.  Don't ask me about the theme.  I have no idea what it is.

In this game you are a city planner in a peaceful, environmentally harmonious society of the distant future (I guess ecosocialism has prevailed on a world scale :-) ). The theme is strong and the whole game features pictures of exotic "cybergreen" buildings, relaxed people walking in nice parks etc.

The actual play consists in expanding the city either in a vertical or horizontal direction by giving one of four possible orders through the combination of playing cards and cardboard tiles. In this way you can muster resources and bonuses influencing your following moves.

Points are scored in several different ways but the main goal is the creation of large "districts" of neighbouring buildings of the same kind dominated by the ones you have built. Who comes second in a district still gets some points, therefore in some cases there is room for co-operation.

Lack of resources and tiles are the main obstacle one struggles to overcome, so the game is mostly about balancing between seizing opportunities and preparing a large enough set of future opportunities to exploit. There is a lot of player interaction because the pursuit of one's own goals almost always interferes with the plans of somebody else (in particular the district formation and domination), but the interference is not complex enough to allow for deep diplomacy.

Even if the rules are really simple, their workings are not easy to master and you will check the basic rules printed on your player screen many times in your first matches. Chances are you will feel like you don't understand what's going on for the best part of your first match, but this can also make it interesting in the long run. My feeling is that the game gets more interesting with time, even if it definitely lacks dramatic events (which is consistent with the theme but not OK for lovers of high-conflict games).

It can be meaningfully played in two and even as a solo game (with an automated opponent who plays randomly but with some advantages, I tried it only once and I lost!), which is a big plus.

There is some swing due to card draw, but not enough to bother me. 

A real winner.

RATING: 7
Tentatively an 8 (pending more plays, could go up or down).

I was drawn to this game both for its theme of futuristic city building (which comes across pretty thinly I should mention) and for the mix of mechanics (area control, tile laying, drafting, pool building, tableau building). The game is a hodgepodge of mechanics but it is quite simple and intuitive to play once you get into it.  I feel little schizophrenic playing it, as I’m unsure whether to devote more time to analyzing my cards in hand and what I’m passing to my opponent versus analyzing the districts in the city for their long-term scoring potentials (which can be quite large). 

More plays will tell whether it rewards experience and a deeper level of decision making or whether it is really about maximizing optimal short-term moves.  It’s a little hard to tell for me right now.  I’m pretty sure the game is better with 2-3 players (with eliminating the rules about removing random cards on the re-shuffle) than it is with 4-5 players, as there is more predictability in the card draws and cycling of cards.

Interesting mechanism. I want to play this more. Now that I better understand how it all works, I can have a more focused approach from the beginning. However, it seems that the final fight for the largest majority is decisive. And that is not something you can do much about, it depends on the cards and the tiles you are drawing in the end. Need to play more, I like the mechanism.

I really enjoy this game but the rules feel just slightly unintuitive enough to keep it from being a 9.  It's a very cool mix of mechanisms I enjoy drafting, engine building, area control, resource management), and has a very unique feel to it.  I love the simple mix of turn actions, although the specific steps for each are a tick tricky and the player guides are not as clear as they should be.  Overall, this is one I want to keep coming back to and now that I have the expansion I'm gunning for several more plays this next year.

I generally like the graphic design of this tile laying game, but it could be a bit clearer in some places.  Highly tactical play but not without the possibility (near minimal) for long term planning.  Theme of the game is irrelevant.

Players play a single card (out of 4) per round, passing the other 3 cards to the player on the left.  Played card can expand or build up the city or be discarded for stuff (tiles, resources, vps).  End game scoring bonuses based upon contiguous tile areas of the same colour with the top 2 players (most player markers in an area) scoring points and end of game scoring bonuses based on cards in tableau.

Also aspects of building an engine to generate stuff (tiles, resources, vps) as the game progresses.  Can certainly attack other player positions.  But as your actions are constrained by the cards and tiles in your hand, the decision space is small (which of the four cards will I play and how?) each round.  It's often not what you want to do, but what you're allowed to do.

Luck (or lack thereof) in the draw of cards is thus critical to success in the game.  Having two mulligan tokens to discard and draw a new hand can be very helpful.  Sure, there are other ways to mitigate luck, but randomness and chaos are both high in this design.

Little depth imo, and plays like a filler except for game length.

RATING: 9
Lots of potential here. The two-player game lacks oomph, as you are continually trading hands. At 3 and 4 you feel like you're drawing a whole new hand every turn but still putting some importance on what you give to the opponent on your left. I like the simplicity of the rules and the weight of the simple decisions.

RATING: 8
Un jeu vraiment bien fait, avec des parties assez courtes et tendues. L'ensemble reste difficile à maîtriser: aucune stratégie ne peut être vraiment développée à moyen terme. Au moins les joueurs les plus calculatoires ne perdront pas trop de temps à réfléchir; ils n'auront qu'à bien choisir leur carte (et donc celles qu'il cèdera à son voisin). Bien sûr l'apport des bonus permanents (suite à une construction en hauteur) orientera les choix futurs, mais sans aucune garantie.
Avis à confirmer en multipliant les parties.

Very reminiscent of Sunrise City, but more strategic and less tactical than that game. After a few 2-player games, it seems to be about trying to find a way to be efficient in milking your bonuses while keeping an eye on the endgame area majority scoring. 

I like the game but do not love it. It doesn't feel like it has much of an arc; it feels like a straight line from beginning to end (which sounds odd in a game about building a city).

This is a very abstracted City Building game, at least I didn't get the feeling that I was building a city at all, I was just placing tiles trying to get majorities and getting bonuses from the cards i had in front of me that triggered with specific actions.

I really liked it... I love when a theme brings a game together but that's a bonus, I don't need to be completely immersed on theme, it only has to be a little bit of theme there and Gink has enough for me.

I really loved the mechanics of the game, the way you try to build big combo chains that trigger when you do a specific action.

I don't remember to hate so much a draft mechanism like the one in this game.

Ginkgopolis has some seldom seen mechanisms but is basically an area control game where you place tiles next to or on top of each other to claim resources, tiles or victory points. The card drawing that dictates your actions may make it too difficult to follow a strategy but it's still a fun and chaotic game.

This game is very dry, and strangely hard to explain although once you get the terminology and the relationships between everything, it's very very easy. The charm of the game lies in the ever-changing board state, and you need to evaluate based on the resources and tiles you have. While tactical, there's a lot of long-term planning than you may have thought of, including what cards to expect in the coming turns. 

The game is best with 2. Any more than that, you are looking at a REALLY tactical game that you can only play your best hoping that not all your opponents turn against you.

Abstract city builder with area control.
I've found you really need to stress the area-control part to players, since it's an important part of scoring.

Quite short, well below 1h, with a bit of luck.
You'll need to keep a strategic goal , but can't afford to neglect the best tactical choice while doing so.

There are various paths to choose, so you need to decide which one is right for you.

Very colorful, yet strict layout on the table. 

I love it ever since buying it in Essen last year. Over half a year later and still loving it. Changed to a 10.

Quite a good game! It is probably one of the most beautifully designed games I've played - everything clicks together in a way that seems inevitable, and yet I've never played anything quite like it. Combines aspects of a lot of my favorite games - RftG, Dominant Species, even a little 7 Wonders. A lot of tactical fun!

Still... something about it doesn't feel quite right. I'm not sure how replayable it's going to be. Sure, a lot changes each game, but the experience still feels samey. And for a game that's not very long, I always kind of wish it would end 10-15 minutes sooner. Not a great sign - but perhaps I haven't discovered the strategic depth of the game yet! We'll see how it ages!

UPDATE: This game has surprised me with how good it is on repeated plays, and I still look forward to bringing it out. I'm bumping it from an 8 to a 9.

RATING: 8
For me this game has two features in common with Troyes, the previous game which the same designer contributed to: a plus (it is very original) and a minus (luck counts somehow a bit more than I like).
Also, like Troyes, tactic seems more important than strategy, that is something that I usually don't like.

So, considering this, Ginkgopolis seems far from a game that I would enjoy, right? Wrong.

First of all it is REALLY original. It is a game that somehow is fresh, new, with some things seen before (for example the card drafting like in "7 Wonders" or the way of scoring the area majority points seen in other games), but there is also A LOT of new ideas. 

Originality would not be enough to enjoy the game, I would have kept my mouth open in wonder for the genial design, but not necessarily wishing to play the game. But.. it is not only an original game. Ginkgopolis is really fun to play and exciting. And, contrarily to what I had read and thought, there is strategy. Yes, the plans can be ruined a bit by luck (and the influence of luck is the only reason that I don't rate this game even higher), but usually the stronger player wins. Besides it is a short game (one hour or less), so the time invested is not too high and makes the luck factor more bearable.

Even if the theme doesn't shine through a lot and it seems nearly an abstract game, actually I enjoy the way players build something and that playing is very open, there are so many different possibilities both for each single player and for the city they are building. Will the city spread outwards a lot, will there be a very high building in it? I confess that looking at the way things evolve so unpredictably makes my child heart rejoice.

Possibly I like this game for the same reason I like Dominant Species, for the spacial dimension and the very tense battles for territory.

It is a game extremely re-playable. It scales from two to four (possibly in five it is not the best, but I have not tried it). In two gets more interesting, because there is more control. In three is better than in four, but in four is still good.

I think that a gamer should not miss this game, at least you have to give a look at the crazily original way the designer couples the cards and the tiles.

A very good game!

Love this game. Plenty of options on your turn despite the randomness of the card draw which is somewhat mitigated by the drafting mechanisim and the option to redraw your hand twice during the game at a small v.p cost.
The area control aspect of the game is awesome and allows for some screwage between players and the huge end game points that a.c brings should never be ignored.

Original, cool combo mechanisms, fast, short, many paths to victory and completely themeless. 

The rules are elegant, quite simple when explained by someone who has already played, and you won't need to check the manual again, except for some symbols in your first game (there are very few symbols and they are intuitive). But the administration is a bit heavy, especially in 3 players games. The components are decent to nice 

The basic mechanisms are tile laying and card combos, with some area control for final scoring. Overall, it makes for an original game. It offers short term tactic decisions, some long term planning, and some luck of the draw (mitigated by the draft and other mechanisms). It offers many paths to victory, and you will have to adapt and make the best out of the current situation while 

It's difficult to get a hang of the game just by reading the rules; you know how to play, but you won't know how to do it well until after your first game.

The game flow is quite fast. I really think 45 minutes games are possible. And if they truly are, this game is a blast.

Deus, possibly my favourite 2014 game, and ZhanGuo, are clearly inspired by the card mechanism of Gingkgopolis. Deus could be described as an alternative with an area map to place buildings, and ZhanGuo adds some other mechanisms to create a more complex and longer game.

Meccaniche non immediate e anche lo schermo con la guida/aiuti non è di immediata lettura; una volta apprese le dinamiche il gioco risulta fluido e originale per meccaniche. Gestione risorse, combo e piazzamento sono gli elementi principali di Ginkgopolis dove invece è poco presente la pianificazione. Nel complesso il gioco è semplice anche se la conoscenza delle carte e dei relativi punti vittoria è fondamentale. Il gioco risente di una fortissima interazione che in 4 o 5 giocatori rende spesso le partite ingovernabili con l'assegnazione dei punti per i quartieri finali che potrebbe subire improvvisi ribaltoni regalando molti punti in maniera un po' casuale; questo aspetto mi fa storcere il naso e non mi fa apprezzare appieno il gioco. Lo trovo però interessante se giocato in 2 giocatori.

Retheme this as King of Hill -- mafia style.    Those cards you draw -- those are contracts put out on the owner of the hill.  Whomever fulfills the contract by taking over gets an ongoing bonus.  You gotta bring more dudes to the hill to take over the hill.  You wanna be on a hill with a lower number -- that'll lose you some reputation. You wanna change the hill type -- that'll cost you an extra thug to get the right things approved.  End game scoring -- who controls the most hills of a connected set gets points for all of the thugs working in that area.

Those thugs are kind of weak and will happily give out stuff to those who build a new hill near them -- so they do not have to face the boss' wrath for being taken over.

[b]Ginkgopolis[/b] was sold via auction 7/10/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]My original thoughts still hold true (in a nutshell I loved everything about the game except how the end game scoring bonuses were tied to the cards you played which made it feel random at times) but since reading other people's comments I realize that more plays would help even out the perceived randomness as you learned the deck. My problem was there was zero interest in the game at my house and limited interest in my gaming group at the time. Now that I game with a different group I have the opportunity to play and I'm looking forward to trying it again. I'm not sure my opinions will vary that much since I still won't get to play it enough, but the mechanics were intriguing enough to make me want to revisit Ginkgopolis.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I love the area control aspect of the game, there is a lot of direct interaction as the board state constantly changes.
- The city building enhances the player interaction. You can either increase the size of the city or make existing buildings taller (which gives you the opportunity to take control of another players building). 
- The whole time you are doing this you also have to manage your resources and tiles (the buildings you can place) which is tense and fun.

So far I am enamored with the game, then it comes time to score and things start falling apart.I really dislike the scoring in this game. Maybe I am stuck on the elegant simplicity of the scoring system of El Grande, which may not be a valid comparison to some, but hear me out. You spend the whole game fighting for control of districts so you can score the most points, but then you also have to take into account the cards you will score as well.

Here is my problem, you can certainly try and plan which cards you may get to score but this could lead you to ignore building towards majorities in certain districts. Some may find managing these opposing scoring mechanisms tense and exciting; I find it frustrating and chaotic. I don't think the two different ways you score blend together at all, there is very little synergy (if any) between the points cards will give you and gaining majorities in districts.

In the end, I love the game play but hate the scoring. I know that I could eventually learn which cards score what, but I am not interested. I wish the scoring was strictly based on area control and didn't involve all of these other seemingly arbitrary scoring cards.[/i]

2.執行行動                                                                                                  
*有些角色卡或保留的建築卡對特定行動有額外的獎賞，如果玩家有這些卡牌在行動後可拿取對應的獎勵。
◎照順位將卡牌與板塊翻開，並執行行動，將打出去的卡牌置入棄牌堆(建設不用)
>開採(出1張卡牌)    出都市化卡拿取一個資源或一個板塊，出建築卡，拿取對應卡牌顏色的物資：紅色－資源、藍色－板塊、黃色－分數。建築卡拿取物資的數量取決於該卡牌對應建築的高度，每有1層樓就可以獲得1個物資。
>都市化(出1張都市化卡與1個板塊) 用打出的板塊取代都市化標記所在的位置上面放一個資源標示擁有權，再放置一個建設點標記(灰)在板塊上以標示對應的卡片尚未加入牌庫，都市化標記移到與板塊垂直相鄰的空位(不可以移斜線)
*當都市化標記沒有空位可以移動時，可以移動1或多個其他的都市化標記來騰出空位，標記的擺放必須遵照字母順序。
*與都市化新加入板塊垂直相鄰的板塊可以得到物資(物資數量同建築物高度，與單獨打出建築卡的效果相同)。
>建設樓層(出1張建築卡與1個板塊) 將建築板塊蓋到對應建築卡的板塊上，板塊上的資源退回對應玩家，每退還1個資源，被退還的玩家就可以得1分。(自己的得不到退回的分數)
*如果蓋上去的板塊比原有板塊的數字小，必須付等同於兩數字差的分數。
*如果蓋上去的板塊顏色與原有不一樣，必須付給1個資源作為費用。
*蓋上去的板塊有幾層，就放幾個資源，將一個建設點標記放在板塊上
*將建築卡面向上置於面前，在之後的遊戲此卡將會給你額外的獎賞。
*獎賞分成2種：
▲常駐獎賞(標有黑色箭頭)－在遊戲中只要符合條件就可以獲得獎賞。
▲結算獎賞(標有「＝」)－結束計分時可以得到分數。
*當玩家出一張卡牌與一張板塊，卻發現資源不夠放置板塊，此時將板塊收回，執行只出卡牌的行動。
3.為下個回合作準備  將未使用的卡牌(包含起使玩家卡)傳給右手邊的玩家後，抽一張牌補足4張，當牌堆抽完時
1.檢查每個有建設標記的板塊，找出對應這些板塊的建築卡加入棄牌堆，然後將棄牌堆重新洗成新的牌庫。
2.如果是2~3人遊戲，要棄掉新牌庫最上方的7張牌。
3.將板塊上的建設標記移除，置入供應區。

遊戲結束                                                                                                          
*當供應區的板塊第一次被抽完時，玩家可以提供擋板後的板塊放入供應區，放置時玩家同時拿出板塊，將板塊面向下洗成新的板塊供應區，遊戲繼續進行。
*玩家每提供1個板塊，就可以得到1分。
*當遊戲進行到下面兩種狀況時遊戲結束：
1.當板塊供應區第二次用完時。
2.當玩家將所有自己顏色的資源放到城市裡時。
*當達到上述兩種狀況之一，所有玩家將當回合的行動執行完畢後，遊戲結束，將下面的分數加總，總分最高的玩家獲勝：
▲在遊戲中贏得的得分標記
▲卡牌上的加分(有「＝」記號)
▲每個未使用的新手牌標記2分
▲玩家在都市內每個城區所得的分數
◎城區是指2個以上垂直相連的同色板塊，顏色獨立的一個板塊不算城區。
◎在每個城區內玩家們比較各自資源的數量：
▲數量最多的玩家可以獲得等同城區內所有資源(包含自己和對手的資源)的分數。
▲數量第二多的玩家可以獲得等同城區內自己資源的分數。
◎如果資源數量一樣多，擁有最高建築的玩家取得優勢；如果還是平手，最高建築物數字較大的玩家取得優勢。
◎如果城區內被單一玩家的資源獨佔，玩家在城區內的資源一個算2分(包含城區內資源第一名與第二名的分數)。

Great components, thick cardboard and very colorful.  This game has a light drafting element, a little area control, and a bit of engine development.  The overlay a building to get its ability is a fun mechanic.  Nothing really stood out while playing this game, but it was a fun experience.

RATING: 7
A fairly abstract tile laying affair which at least has the benefit of being a decently interesting abstract tile laying affair, as abstract tile laying affairs go. Get a hand of 4 cards, choose 1 each turn to play out. They can be used to generate dudes or get tiles (necessary because you can also ...), play a card/tile combo to expand the city horizontally (placing a dude on it, get some one-off benefits) or play a tile on top of another tile that matches a card in your hand and get the permanent ongoing benefit related to the covered up tile. It also means whoever was covered off gets kicked off the map, and as area majority scores big at the end of the game (areas being adjacent tiles in the same colour), there can be some big king-making swings towards the end. Which I'm not so enamoured with and will hinder much long term replay. The other downer is that you can only cover up the tile you want if you draw the appropriate card - BIG luck factor as the end-game approaches. Otherwise, the decision process each turn (what's the best play with the 4 cards you have), where each card can be played a few ways, is engaging. But it doesn't get away from the fact that this is, essentially, an abstract tile laying affair and as such doesn’t have a lot of legs in my world. I liked it, but not enough to seek it out over the many games I like more.

Three plays now, and I am still liking this game, although I find it difficult to master.  While the symbolism on the cards is good, I find myself and most of those I play with needing to be reminded of rules coonstantly.  It is just not intuitive enough.   But that is my only complaint.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: When explained the game, it seems confusing, but in the end, there is very little to do on each turn. It plays well and has some originality, however the main issue is that you cannot really plan. Since your cards that you use to build get passed to the right at each turn, you basically just do the best you can with what you have. You could hope that a card will come back to you, but it rarely works out. Nice mechanic, but that random aspect really puts me off.

This is a very cleverly interconnected tile-laying game.  You can either add tiles to the city to help you gain resources, or stack them on other tiles to gain bonus cards that will either make your future actions better, or give you end-game bonus points.  The cards you need to stack a tile are numbered, and the tiles themselves are colored, so you need the right combination of things to be able to stack.  You really need to be able to manage your resources effectively to be able to jump on opportunities as they arise.  There is also an element of area control layered on top of this entire enterprise at the end of the game, which is just as important as building your engine or even getting the bonus-point cards.  It's a fairly simple system that is interconnected in interesting ways that provides a lot of opportunity for strategic choice.

RATING: 6
City-building game, with simultaneous action selection and nice theme (city in the future). Area control is a core mechanism in this game and you'll end up fighting for large districts, which ultimately determine the winner. Furthermore, it has direct player interaction, as you might end up kicking the other players' resources and place your own, in your attempt to control a big district; this high interaction is absent from most eurogames.

Ginkgopolis plays quickly, as rules are very easy to explain and all players chose their actions at the same time. On the downside, the game is a bit abstract; the mechanics tie together well, but they don't integrate very well with the theme. Players might think: "Why am I doing this? How controlling districts is related to city building?". But, still, it remains a good, fast game, played under an hour.

RATING: 7
I really like the game itself - it´s a rather abstract but a clever tile laying/area control game and the artwork is nice - pleasant and calming. What I don´t like that much is the scoring - some cards score so much higher than others that it makes the earlier game less important and scores are long apart. I would rate it higher if it had different (read less swingy) scroing system.

I finally got to try Ginkgopolis, which some friends have been raving about for ages. I’ve played Xavier George’s Troyes, which is really like, but not Carson City. I definitetly saw similarities between Ginkgopolis and the former. Both games are quite abstracted, and revolve around players putting together a point-churning combo engine. I like that experience, but I found Troyes to be a bit more strategic and thinky, which is more to my taste. This play of Ginkgopolis was with 5, so it may also be that it becomes a little less tactical with fewer players. This is one I’ll be happy to play again, but Troyes gives a similar experience but provides more rewarding gameplay.

Kind of 7 Wonders drafting meets Infinite City tile-placement city building.
It's actually pretty solid, as games go. I just couldn't "vibe" with the game, though. It felt a little clunky at times

Artwork is quite nice, though. If someone else wanted to play it, I'd relent, but it isn't one I'd offer to play that often myself, though.

It ~does~ play 5, though, which is significant (to me, anyway)

Nice ‘little’ game that yields a good feeling of progress as you play. It felt constrained but not over-crowded, with simple rules once you got them right in your head. I did come up against one problem: your first decision is so big, it can massively influence the rest of your game. Which is a problem for first-time players (or those with a bad memory *ahem*) who may not yet have a clear idea of strategy, then realise two rounds in what a huge blunder they have made.

Interesting city building/area control game. There's a lot of strategy at every stage, but the game essentially comes down to being lucky by drawing the right card and the right tile at the right time. 

I'd play it again, but even though there are a lot of interesting elements in this game such as card drafting, engine building and a minor resource management aspect, in the end the random aspects have a little too much sway in what you can accomplish.

(Comments after a half dozen plays)

A mostly-abstract game with simple rules and a sense of progression.

Pros:
* An area majority game that works really well for 2!
* Great components with beautiful artwork. The tiles are thick and the unique art depicting incremental development on every building tile is a lovely touch.
* Good interaction with some excellent opportunities for powerful game changing turns. Has our favorite characteristic where being in a strong position might set you up for a strategic counter attack.
* Easy for a single details-oriented player to help everyone else notice all the extra bonuses they get and keep the right number of resources, markers, etc where they need to be.

Cons:
* Cumbersome setup and tedious cleanup. The cards need to be separated by type and color AND sorted by number. There are only 60 cards that need to be sorted, but it's still a couple extra minutes spent on one end or the other of setup/cleanup.
* The gameplay is smooth, but each time the draw deck runs out, there's a pause where you have to sift through those sorted piles of cards for the colors/numbers that match the tiles you built. Messes with the flow.
* End game scoring can be somewhat complex depending on which end-game scoring cards come into play. While it's great that the game gives you so many different ways to earn points, it does mean you'll be counting up cards and resources and tiles over and over at the end of the game.

Neutral:
* I wish the victory point tiles had been different sizes or colors to make it easier to exchange.

= 2016-02-20

Sure enough, we were playing it incorrectly. I thought you were only ever allowed to take a building up to level 3. This resulted in us expanding our city horizontally instead of vertically much more than we should have, which made the deck larger. It also meant we weren't acquiring as many building cards so we were cycling through the tiles more slowly.

With the correct rules, the game length feels just right.

= 2016-02-07

After having this on my shelf for three years, I finally got a chance to play it.

It started out wonderfully and we kept commenting on how much we were enjoying the smooth flow of the game and the simple but meaningful decisions, but it just kept dragging on and on and on. When we finally depleted the tile stack the first time, we both agreed not to put any more tiles in so we could be done with it. Then came the cumbersome process of counting up scores and separating (and sorting!) all of the components out.

I'm hoping we just missed an important rule and the game isn't supposed to drag like that.

RATING: 4.5
Quite similar to [thing=97357][/thing] but much, much more streamlined.

However, it's still way too fiddly for what it is, a very light city building game. Most disconcerting is why players have to pass their hand of cards to their opponent after every turn. This makes the game very chaotic and removes any long-term planning from the game. Perhaps the rationale is to prevent players from hoarding all the good (and all the bad) cards?

Anyway, it is a very streamlined city building game. There are only three currencies: building tiles, resources, and points. All the special powers of the buildings (other than those that give points at the end of the game) involve getting these three resources. Refreshingly simple.

RATING: 7
Pros:
1. Puzzle. This game is a nice puzzle. You are competing for a majority in certain areas. You can puzzle interesting way to cut off, expand or build around areas.
2. Engine Building. As you expand the city, you keep cards that provide bonuses for certain actions. You can leverage those actions to get many points.
3. Multiple Routes to Victory. Controlling districts is a powerful way to score points, but so is activating point buildings, leveraging bonus cards, or even a combo of all of them. 

Cons:
1. AP Prone. AP players will sometime stare at the board for a  while trying to figure out the optimal move. This especially becomes a problem when they've managed to collect large amounts of tiles.
2. Luck. There is plenty of luck mitigation in the cards. You pass your hands, and you have tokens that allow you draw new cards. However, there is no luck mitigation in tile draws. Part of the fun of the game is doing your best with the tiles you have, but it can become frustrating when you repeatedly pull the same colors or lower numbered tiles.
3. Teaching. This game is fairly abstract and does not relate to the theme at all. This can make it difficult to teach. This game takes about 15 minutes to teach and you will have to give constant reminders of the rules while playing. Once they know the rules, the game plays fast.

Summary: This is a solid puzzle game. A game is an engine that converts time into fun and this game just isn't efficient enough. The amount of energy into teaching and set up versus the amount of fun I get out of it doesn't work. This game will rarely hit my table and usually only with people who already know the game or very experienced gamers who can pick up the game quickly.

I love this game. It is an excellent mixture of a tactics game and of a strategy game. The game has a very good replay value because the playing time is just right and there is almost no downtime for the players.

I gave it a rating of 9. It would have given it a 10 if it didn't require variants like the "Special Setup Variant" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1016273/special-setup-variant) to reduce the randomness in games with 2 or 3 players.

This is a pretty solid engine-building game with a somewhat pasted-on theme of city-building.  I like the game pretty well but it isn't the most intuitive to play right out of the box.   It may take a couple of games to get into this one, but it's worth it if you like engine-building games with a splash of area control.

The game flows smoothly and looks gorgeous. There's definitely some subtle strategy in the card play that takes some time to understand. It's more tactics than strategy, actually, as your turn seems more to be about taking the action that would benefit the person to your left the most, to prevent them from executing it when you pass your cards.

Overall: I'm a fan of Xavier's heavier games, and while this one is definitely lighter, it feels unique enough to be a welcome addition to my collection. I also suspect it will improve over more plays.

I'm still not really sure what I feel about this game, despite having owned it since Christmas 2012 and having played it 5 or 6 times in the following couple of years. It has interesting mechanics and is beautifully produced - and I wanted to love it because the reviews I'd read made it sound like it would really be my kind of game. Yet in actual play I've been underwhelmed - and my most recent play (summer 2015) was more or less a disaster. One of the players, a regular in my group, was actually new to the game, and while the rules in themselves are actually pretty simple, we seemed to keep having to stop for various corrections and explanations as to what he could and couldn't do. Most of the blame for this is probably mine, in being a bad teacher - but I could not get away from the fact that this game is just too "busy" to be really fun. There is really a lot going on, after all - drafting, area majority, bonuses from cards, and the slightly awkward endgame procedure where everyone returns tiles face-down. I think it's actually pretty interesting, so I still rate it 7 - but I have felt after almost every play that it's a game I have more fun thinking about than I do actually playing. I still want to play it, albeit not all the time, and I hope that future plays will convince me of the game's worth.

I don't know if I like this game or not... there is a lot of originality crammed into this game, for sure, and it plays extremely fast, but I still don't know what is a good move and what is not after quite a number of games.

It seems that in the first half of the game you are trying to build an engine of sorts, and in the second half you try more to make moves that minimise your opponents benefiting from theirs. The last couple of turns are all about playing the control game in the district and with 2 it's likely to result to even scores in the district, and with more you are blindly overbuilding hoping the chaos will favor you.

... I'm sure there is some art to it, but too many random factors at play to execute much as desired for my taste.

Graphics aside the game intrigued me and made ​​plans to build on more and really interesting.

The things that I did not like:

Can I play a card, always keeping in mind that the cards at the end of the turn will pass to the player on the right ...
All cards .. seemed to me too .... and giving away all the cards have no way of impostarti a strategy ...

the second round of cards will depend on how many players will give back their cards ..... Until the end you will not know how long ...

Of course the strategy mother is in the characters .... but the cards would help ...

The next time I try it with the draft ... but the game has potential, maybe it should be incorporated into the homerules to appreciate more ....

RATING: 6.7
--Dec2013-- It's pretty; the gameplay is cute; but I don't think I'm part of the ideal target audience.  While I could easily be wrong, it seems to me that it's tactical-strategic balance is very strongly tilted toward the tactical:  there's very little information (or clarity) about what the future might hold.  And so one repeatedly makes the "best decision available."  Which isn't a terrible game; but not quite the style I'd prefer.

RATING: 7
This game has a pretty interesting format and mechanics.  The engine building aspect is nice and I like that you can plan for it in the draft.  I would really like to get another play in to hone the things we discovered in the first games.

Theme here is very tacked-on.  That's not so much a problem as an observation.  It's a strange them and an odd name.  I'm not sure those choices made the game more compeling.  The art is nice and the graphics support the examples.

This is a great little strategy game. The box says 2-4, but I would not try this again at 4. 2 has been great, and 3 would probably be fine, but at 4 players there is too much chaos and not enough strategy.

Sleeved. Great game with dual option cards, area control, a little card drafting, hidden info and very cool art. I find myself a little bored towards the end when it becomes what I feel, a hunt for getting the best end-game bonus cards. I'd def love to try it with the expansion sometime.

A very nice city building game.  The drafting of cards during play works very well like it does in 7 wonders.  I often wanted to bury a card I was going to have to pass and new it would come back to bite me.  Played 2 player which was very cut-throat.  I think it would be better with more players.

RATING: 6
For someone like myself who is not a big abstract tile area majority fan, even I can recognise that this incarnation is very well done.

Passing your unused cards onto the next player works very well here. You'll know three of the four cards your left neighbour will be able to choose from, and it creates an interesting decision as you try to maximise what's good for you, but not hand them a gift or something they'll be able to use to damage one of your majorities.

The choice of adding a card to your tableau is an interesting one as well. Build up and get a card for future use, or expand the level one sprawl of the city and reap the resources. It does feel a bit thematic to me.

Then there's the bonuses of the cards in your tableau. You can't have them all, so which is going to be best for building up a resource or point engine? Which can't you bear to pass onto your neighbour?

It all adds up to many small, yet significant decisions, culminating is a real focus on the area majorities in the final rounds and where you can profit or do the most damage. Everybody's doing it, so what you lose in one area you tend to win in another. But you have to play the give and take game in order to win - you can't afford to sit it out. All the decisions are intertwined, but they don't overly slow the game down.

I'm happy to play this game, but the more I play the more I see what little control I have. After more than 50 games I'm not convinced there's really enough control over what you're doing to take it very seriously, but it's just the right length, depth and social interactivity to use as a great example of what makes this Eurogame genre so successful.

RATING: 7
Ginkgopolis is among that kind of game that is very popular at the moment: themeless and somehow mathy (not that there are any calculations, but it feels like an algorithm could play it perfectly), going all-in on replayability.

That said, I enjoy that kind of game, and Ginkgopolis too. I still have to figure out that algorithm though, because I always have a hard time focusing both on the game flow and the endgame majorities.

Un juego abstracto con unos componentes muy chulos. Oficialmente va de construir una ciudad del futuro, pero nunca me ha generado tal sensación. Las mecánicas son difíciles de entender en las primeras partidas. Será necesario darle algunos meneos para apreciar el juegazo que se esconde detrás. Las partidas durarán entre 45 min y una hora y pienso que funcionará igual de bien a cualquier número de jugadores. A 5 será menos estratégico evidentemente. Los científicos y el orden en que se cogen las losetas lo hace muy rejugable. Hay que probarlo

This is an interesting drafting/area control game. While none of the mechanics are new in and of themselves, they are combined into a game unlike anything else I've played.

This game seem really counter-intuative and my brain really struggled to connect whith the mechanics. I won the game I played by doing the one thing I understood over and over again but that was probably because the person explaining the game was banging his head on the table at my multiple rules questions.

RATING: 8
It got my attention as it is by one of the designers of Troyes, one of my all-time favorites.  It's got some interesting tile-laying mechanics and it can really get a bit chaotic as you are constantly passing your hand around, so just because you build something, doesn't mean it will be yours for long.  Another perk is it's quick play time - 4p game in about an hour.  I'd definitely give it another spin or two, but this has some potential.

Two years in between plays didn't do anything to tarnish this one.  Really fun game and gets a bump up in rating.

7 Wonders meets area control. Which sounds more my cuppa than 7W itself. There's drafting (of sorts), some engine building and VP spreadsheet - all familiar from 7W model. And then's the board, modular and 3D (well, ok, stacking). The taking over of areas and shifting of ares is where the main interest and interaction of the game lie. But you need some engine building to do well in this. 

The game is relatively short, but there's a lot of rules and mechanisms to digest at first. Not only that, the game has AP inducing moments (as hands that circle in drafting are always restacked, you're all the time dealing with something new). It feels like there's constant effort required, both from merely running the game, to playing it well (optimising). Play with people who don't overthink stuff. 

Ok, yes, the theme, hm, well it's supposedly about something. Ginkgo, uhm, at least it looks cute. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Although the game has not much to offer in term of theme, this game is packed with strategies and interesting game mechanics. The game is complete without the expansion (there is one variation rules in expansion that you should play with, but you don't need to purchase the expansion for the variant). I continue to enjoy playing this game and will definitely continue to enjoy for long time.

RATING: 7.5
Played once with 4P. For a game that plays under an hour, the gameplay for Ginkgopolis can seem initially opaque. Not only is the game abstract, but the actions are heavily interconnected, which makes it difficult to understand why certain things happen when you take a particular action. 

Once things fall into place however, Ginkgopolis is thankfully more intuitive than it appears. It takes some classic Euro mechanisms but twists them a little. This is primarily a tactical game rather than a strategic one, since your actions are limited to the cards you draft and the tiles you get.

One of the best titles to come out in 2012! I like how there is a sort of deck-building aspect as the buildings are added to the deck and I especially enjoy the chaining of adding building cards to your display to get more bang for your buck on your turn. There's also a cool area-control aspect just for a little icing on the cake.

RATING: 7
Several plays live and PBW (boiteajeux).

A cool city-building, area-majority game with a really clever way to manage the card deck so it always reflects the changing structure of the city. The card drafting that happens _every_ hand makes this largely tactical rather than strategic, but there is still room to make some longer range plans (especially in the way you build up your resources -- tiles and tokens). I also like the endgame condition, and the way players can have some level of control (although not as much as you might think at first -- it can end very quickly!).

The best thing about the game is the clever mechanic relating to deck construction (how tiles built over come out of the deck, going into players' displays; and tiles added to the city are added to the deck): I love love love it! Of course, the game is pretty fun, too! However, it seems to get worse with every additional player (too chaotic, too many changes, too little possibility for making any kind of plan). Probably best with 2 or 3 players.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
A tile-laying area-majority game with drafting and a unique city-building mechanism. A specific set of tiles (in one of 3 colors) are randomly put in a 3x3 grid at the start of the game. Letter tiles are placed around the perimeter. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and set in Supply. A deck of cards, composed of cards with those letters and the numbers on the tiles, are shuffled. 

Each round, deal cards to all players who then draft a single card to play, and pass the rest to the left. Cards can be played with or without a tile, and will do different things such as:
- add a tile to the city (either expanding outward at a specific letter, or upwards on top of a tile)
- give you cash, tiles, workers, and/or VP
- add a card to your personal display
As you add tiles to the city, you add the matching card to the deck (and if you covered a tile, remove the card matching that tile) -- clever!
As you add cards to your display, your personal actions get stronger (each card may add to some specific type of action, e.g., draw an extra tile when you take tiles).

As you add tiles to the city, you're also placing your workers on the tiles. At the end of the game, each contiguous area of the same color scores VP for players with workers there (area majorities) based on the total number of workers in the area). The player with the most total VP wins!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good game, not too terribly complicated but with some decent depth and lots and lots of room for strategy.

You have only 3 basic actions and it is performed through card drafting sort of in the vein of 7  Wonders.  When you perform these different actions ("using" a card, placing a building, or upgrading a building) you get bonuses based on the cards you have in front of you.

There are multiple paths to victory because there are many ways to score points.  The actions in the game can each score you points depending on the cards you have,  there is an end-game area majority scoring, and certain cards give you other end-game bonuses.

My first game I pursued area majority while my opponent pursued high value end-game bonuses and the final score was only a difference of 29 (which isn't that much in this game, the final scores were 90-119).  There is a lot of interactivity and a lot of choices to make which makes it a very, very interesting game.

My only concern is that there isn't a lot of variability in the game so if there is a winning strategy it can be discovered and the game would otherwise become pretty stale anyway pretty quickly.

RATING: N/A
Xavier Georges is a very creative and inovative designer. Ginkgopolis is not an exception. He presents us a card driven game that slyghtly reminds me of Notre Dame because of the card switching happening each turn. But the game has nothing to do with the mentioned above because the overall feeling is trully distant from the honnest but already beaten feeling of colecting resources to do stuff.

In this game, instead of the usual, players get a pattern designed with letters that is used to expand the board. Also a covering tile system (Taluva way) that is used to grant (most effectivelly) more resources of a players's color in order to achieve more points in the given area influence. 
When starting to play one has the feeling that the choice of cards and tiles is related only a bit with a strategic feeling but when the coin drops, then we have a full strategic feeling of an important rather esquisit and tough set os choices given by your options.

Not easy to get into but once you manage to play a first few turns then it turns out to be a rather easy to play but hard to master kind of game.

The feeling of play is quiet original and that is why this is the kind of game that has its own place on every game colection, mostly because you have an original gameplay and a totally original feeling.

I saw this game first a few months ago at LeiriaCon (January 12) in a different name (Chicago) but didn't have the opportunity to play it then although I heard nothing but good things about it. I now confirm those, until today, rumors, and can assure that gamers won't get regreted if getting Ginkgopolis. 

First Essen 12 game I play this year and it really set the standards high. Congratulations Xavier for the design. Great game you have here!

RATING: 5.5
First impressions: polished but soulless little card-drafting/engine-building game. It uses an elegant system of unique cards (cleverly designed to avoid the possibility of contention) which are only brought into the game once their associated building tile has been placed. The important actions are building the city out sideways ("urbanization", which also activates adjacent buildings) or upwards (gain a permanent bonus, e.g. +1 resources every time you urbanize or end of game VP).

The interesting part is those permanent bonuses, three of which are drafted by each player at the start of the game. Each player has very different developments and incentives, which always makes for an interesting game.

The main problem is that the card drafting system, just as in 7 Wonders, makes the game impossibly tactical with higher player counts. There are choices to be made around current value for yourself vs cards you don't want to pass to an opponent, but there is little scope for planning other than to accrue useful bonus tiles or build up resources in the hope of getting something you want.

Given that end of game scoring seems to often be decisive (certainly without experienced players deliberately keeping areas separate), the lack of control is painful.

I think it is substantially better with lower player counts, so my rating is an average on a scale: 6-7 with two players, 4 with five and the rest in between.

Despite the familiar elements of card drafting and resource gathering, Ginkgopolis pulls it together and a clever and different way.

RATING: 7
Tile laying area control game that's perhaps a little too random for its own good. The aim of the exercise is too place tiles and resources representing buildings in a futuristic city in an attempt to obtain success points. This is achieved by either using cards to 'urbanize' (place on the outskirts) or 'build' (place on top of already existing tiles). Once you have built tiles you get to keep the card depicting the tile underneath and these provide various powers such as obtaining more tiles, resources or success points, and this leads to some pleasing combinations. The scoring is multi-layered meaning that there are a few routes to victory that can be taken, but there is possibly too much luck involved regarding which cards and tiles one draws for this game to be truly great.

Still wrapping my head around the rhythm of the game play but enjoying the ride.  Rules are very straightforward but there is obviously some hidden depth.  Card drafting, area control, resource management, engine building are all interesting.  Passing hands around the table adds an interesting puzzle and really requires you to analyze your opponents board position so that you don't hand them a key card that will interfere with your plans.

RATING: 6
This is a provisional rating, based on one play.

The rules seemed overly clunky when learning for what is actually a pretty simple drafting, area control game.

It's neither pretty nor ugly, just 'meh'. Alas, I found none of the actions particularly exciting or interesting and we all seemed to just stumble through the game until it's conclusion.

I'm not sure if I was missing something here, or whether there is nothing else to find.

Impressions after one play:

Mechanics-wise it feels like a solid game, very interesting premises, but the actual execution falls a bit flat to me.  Most of the time you can't do what's best for you because either you have the resources and you are stuck with a bad hand of cards, or you have the cards you need and you don't have the resources to overlap that tile. This lack of control was a big factor in my experience.

Maybe I got it wrong, and with experience it's easier to optimize your gameplay (we also didn't draft the starting abilities, which I can be a big factor in the early game strategy). Need to give it another try before giving a final verdict.

RATING: 7
You build a city. Every round you have 3 cards. You need new tiles (to build) and recources (to pay for building). Sometimes you get points for building, some ponts you can get through bomus cards, some from majorities. 

Fast, interesting, different from other games.

First game is very much a write off, but you will find yourself shortly afterwards saying "I'd try that again."  The mechanics are quite engaging and unique providing lost of player interaction and system building strategies.  The tile placement is actually the heart of the game providing interesting choices.  The fact that it seems to have multiple paths to victory as well as different workable strategies to get there sets this one pretty high.  Hard teach for new players or non gamers, examples aren't clear and the icon language can be tricky at first.  Art is lovely, theme... lacking.

Simple yet very deep rules at the same time, that take some time to twist your head around. Very clever city-building and handcards-swapping mechanisms. It takes a while to really grasp how it works even though you don't have a myriad of possible actions (3 to be precise). Nevertheless you have a lot of options every turn. And you'repassing on a lot of options to your coplayer every round. Elegant and clever, the whole game feels like something new!

Very nice solo game variant. On par with Suburbias solo variant I'd say. Not that I'm much of a solo gamer, but right now it's the only way possible and these two titles, together with Friday, I enjoy solo immensely.

RATING: 7.5
I'm excited to give it a try as a solo game while in Guatemala. It also seems like a decent little multi-player game. I love the artwork too. I'll report more when I have a couple plays under my belt.

::UPDATE::

2/31/13 - I played my first game yesterday and I'm impressed by the initial play. It was tense right to the end of the game. It felt to have a bit of an accordion effect, where one player will have a couple of strong moves and position himself into lead, but then his resources are flat for a few turns, allowing other players to swing by him. This can be a good thing if it's something that can be controlled by players as they familiarize themselves with the game and its sub-surface layers, so only time will tell if that will be a problem, or a good thing.

I look forward to a solo play of it too. I hope the bot player is a good implementation for solo play.

I'm rating it an 8 after my first play. Interesting enough, this game has the potential to both climb or drop in rating with further play.

Since I played it yesterday, I've been craving another play soon. That's a good sign.

::UPDATE::

4/7/13 - I' upping my rating to an 8.5 for how well it plays as a solo AND a 2-player game. The solo game is very challenging, and the 2-player game is very tense. 

Ash has decided that this game does card drafting WAY BETTER than 7 Wonders. It's currently one of her favorites.

At this point, I highly recommend this for Euro gamers who like limited resources, difficult decisions, and good confrontation.

So I was thinking the other day that I'd like to find a nice area majority game that was based around tile placement options and incorporated simultaneous action selection. BAM. That's Ginkgopolis. A bit abstract? Sure it more than a bit abstract I mean I was quite surprised to read the fluff text in the rule book telling me that we were building a city in symbiosis with nature. Loads of fun though. 

Interesting to report that the game plays a good bit differently with 2 player than with 5 but never the less it's a fun play at 2.

Even though it looks a bit dry, I enjoyed this game a lot more that I thought I would. It offers meaningful decisions while keeping downtime at a minimum and overall playing time relatively short. You could easily fit two games into a single game night. Basically, it is an action selection system with majority scoring. But I love how you benefit from tiles that you place in front of you, and how these benefits are specifically tied to the actions that you can take - encouraging you to specialize in one area or the other. And the artwork on both tiles and cards is nice too!

RATING: 4
This game is ridiculous. The amount of rules overhead and fiddliness at each stage of the game is quite exasperating and frankly exhausting. From shuffling of the deck to adding construction tokens and double checking the bonuses obtained for each action, the game is rife with all these niggly little details. The rule book is also down right horrid. The game itself has straightforward instructions complicated by the iconography and non-intuitive game play. How is this game rated so high and even by my geek buddies? I am baffled. Xavier Georges designs are now an immediate no go for me. From Carson City to Troyes and now Ginkgopolis. I believe this is the third and final strike for him.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Finally, someone designed a draft game correctly. 7 Wonders and Sushi Go both lack and are all style and no substance. Ginkgopolis on the other hand comes into the fold by adding both tableau building, resource collection and area control. 

You can choose to focus only on the board but the cards which help build your tableau make different actions more viable. 

I really enjoyed this one. This is viable alternative to drafting in Magic, which, before Ginkgopolis, was the only viable draft game. 

Our first game was sprawling in all directions and our second game was a straight up race for the skies. Played it exclusively with 2 and excited to play it with more.

Brilliant combination of mechanics that shouldn't work together, but somehow do. 

+ Quirky theme - Georges could have easily just made this another "build a city in Medieval Europe" game, with the three colors of building being the three estates (Clergy, Nobility, and Commoners), like in Troyes. But he didn't, and if a little odd (Ginkgo??), the theme is at least fresh.

(Feb 2012 after 3 plays) - This game fits the almost perfect niche for me - plays in an hour, has multiple game mechanics (area control, tile laying, simultaneous action, hand management), multiple ways to score points and a few game end triggers.   There just seems to be a lot of game packed into it.

There is some interaction when you build over someone else, but it is not Ameritrash conflict by any means.

Based on two plays on boiteajeux - suspect my rating would be higher if played FTF.

Drafting area control game as many others have said - but what reduces it for me are:

Looks good, tiles are nice and thick, the cards are rather flimsey but there are a lot of them. Theme not there but it is an excellent puzzle area control type game with the added deck building mechanic. Only thing is your deck is not being altered it is the draw deck itself and any cards that you do not play this turn are passed to the next player in a sushi go/7wonders type way. The more I think about the game the more I like it. Must play again.

Rating based on an unfinished badly-explained game, so probably not very reliable.
This game is sooo brainy, tricky, convoluted that i can't understand where to start to do anything. just plain chaos where things do not have any meaning that help understanding what i am doing. i can give it another chance just because first time it was badly explained

Edit:
After secondo attempt, we still couldnt finish a game, this time with 4 players. This game has one good thing: nice victory points token and good material/art (+0.2 rating).
The rest of the game is really unbearable. It is tricky, cumbersome, convoluted, pointless, inelegant, jubmled, muddled. We couldnt force ourselves to drag till the end of a game where actions are pretty meaningless and disjointed, without a conceivable strategy to build something upon. I am sorry i don't want to see this game again around me.

I really like the choices presented in this game; there's always a lot to think about every turn, particularly once the city starts to build up. That said, it's a bit too competitive for me to play it often with my friends. I enjoy it most as a solo game, where I don't have to worry about crushing someone else's section of the city for the sake of points. 
Edit Oct. 2015: I bumped the rating up to 8 because I enjoy playing this a lot, even though I don't get the opportunity as much as I might wish.

At first, the game feels overwhelming and complicated. As Yves pointed out, it isn't at all intuitive. But as you play, the internal logic becomes apparent and it's actually a really stimulating game with a lot of interesting elements: the turn options, the theme of the game, and, my favorite, the special powers you get with each card and how they can stack. I ended up tremendously enjoying this game: I came away feeling refreshed, intellectual, and pleasant. It does exactly what a game should do: challenge you to think while entertaining you and allowing you a chance to bond with friends (although it doesn't leave *much* room to be social, the turns aren't so complex that you can't chat alongside it). I feel that it is a very unique addition to anyone's collection.

We are master architects in the far off future building our 3-D cities on an abstract randomly generated 3x3 grid of tiles.  Draft variable worker powers. Play cards with tiles for city growth (up and out) that trigger resources and cards for your future building plans. Gain benefits and points from area majority of city buildings. Pass your hand of cards at end of round adds another layer to strategy worrying about what you are giving away. Interesting how buildings activate when draw pile is depleted. Above all this trying to keep track of the end of game bonus objectives. Plenty to think on.

Pretty good. Interesting tile-laying and card-drafting game where you have to keep your engine humming with resources while you complete tiles that build area control. The bonus system and endgame scoring are also quite interesting.

I found the endgame a bit odd, where people can sort of throw tiles back to slightly extend it, but it's a game where everything starts making sense halfway through the game.

Some nice decisions in this one. Also, a fairly frequent changing of control seems to happen near the end, which makes things amusing.

RATING: 5
I really loved this game for the first 5-6 play through.  I really wanted to love this game for the next 5-10.  By the 15th play through it was clear that the game was completely unbalanced (at least for 2 players).  All of the games after that have been painful.

There is a single best strategy in the game (at least for 2 players).  It is easy to crush any player that doesn't adhere to it.  Of those that do, the initial card draft and the first and second cycle of the deck determine who the winner of the game will be.  Which ever player has even the slightest better luck or advantage in the initial draft or the slightly better set of "building a floor" cards 4-9 will win the game 95% of the time.  It then becomes a quick race with re-hand tokens to grab those first few cards that give exploit and building a floor bonuses.  After that, the game is over.  All you have to do is play another hour for it to actually end.  

We have just stared working on house rules to beef up the urbanize option, but without something, this game is broken, at least for two players.

Extremely fiddly with substantial amount of bookkeeping and intermediate stage setup. Given that the game length is meant to be on the shorter side, it felt like there was little game time compared with all that "work". There also seems to be substantial amount of uncontrollable luck involved, revolving around getting the right tile draws and right cards. Game components are high quality but artwork is uninspiring. Player interaction is indirect and moderate.

The theme of this game is a tree. Besides the cardboard tiles, cards and tokens, I didn’t discover anything in this game that has something to do with a tree. That said, it should be clear that this is another Euro-game with a pasted on theme. As there are two basic actions (you play a card or you play a card together with a tile), you might expect that this is an easy game. Well, big surprise. It isn’t. Somewhere, and I didn’t discover where or how, the game-play isn’t logical at all. You keep thinking ‘what can I do?’. You’ll take a look at the player-aid and somewhere in the back of your mind, you’ll remember what the possibilities were. And still…..

After playing over half of the game, suddenly everything felt into place, and it turned into a smooth, tile-laying, strategic game. The interaction between players stops at the moment you pass your cards to them. When playing with four, this will be four simultaneous solo-games. The artwork on the tiles is just great. There are three kind of buildings. Each with a value between 1 and 20, where 1 is the cheapest and 20 is the most expensive building. Each building becomes a little more advanced when the value becomes bigger. Unusefull, but very nicely done and a nice finishing touch. Forget the tree-theme and just enjoy the game.

This is a game where the sum is less than the parts.  I love Taluva and this had a similar feel.  Many of the mechanics were interesting - crushing tiles, playing cards and then getting an ability, playing cards with or without tiles, changing the draw deck as the city expanded, etc.  However, I found a 4-player game to be rather chaotic.  It was hard to develop and implement a strategy because you never knew what 4 cards you would have to choose from. It was also way too easy for a single play on the last round of the game to destroy all the work you had done the rest of the game and often nothing you can do to block it because you drew the wrong cards or tiles.

It was 7.3. now it is 5. 

the game has only one way to win is to "play cards". The other two actions does not really give points. They are more like traps. I would not like to play the game again, unless the expansion can fix it.

Nicely designed [gameid=98]-like game in an attractive setting. I don't dislike it, but to state there are innovative mechanisms in it and that the game is top ... I don't believe so.

However I can enjoy this game with a couple of friends, who become ecstatic on bashing the leader, as long as they are not.

Risk on post-apocalyptic steroids!  I like the card play/powers.  This adds a bit of intrigue and non-predictability to players' actions, since you never know what your opponent has in his hand, or even less, what card he will play that round.  The modular board is of good quality, and the plastic minis and artwork on the cards is fantastic!    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An improved Risk with a fair number of new mechanics and gameplay situations. Nice the card driven activation phase plus special ability bonus and the given number of moves and attacks: it helps a lot to balance the situation. 

Neat and easy to understand the rules and the development of a match is unpredictable but non-chaotic as Risk always tend to be. Moreover the mechanics free from the turtle effect a bit though not definetely.

A nice alternative to more detailed wargames: an entry level to wargame to lure your casual gamers into strategy and tactics. Well done but fair from perfection and a little bit unflavoured. 

Indeed considered the wonderful Parente's universe of Dust, I hoped to see a little bit more of in depth charachterisation of the faction. Anyway I suppose they tried just do do a better Risk and that's all.

RATING: 5
Aka - European supermodels go to war, based on the cover art. The mechanics of the game reward playing aggressively, which is not my favorite style, which is reflected in my rating.  There are a lot of little points which are important, but hard to remember the first time you play.

It is easier to go after other's territories than defend your own.  I think that with future games my attacks will be much more sparing of my own resources.  The game mechanics do create a surprisingly well balanced game.  The game scales well for various numbers of players.

A game that I would recommend over this one would be Attack+Attack Deluxe.

An entertaining global dust-up and a fresh twist on world-conquest games with just enough "theme" and "backstory" to tie it together.

Manageable rules (both versions) and good limits on non-phasing Player downtime to keep things moving along.

Lotsa bits; tanks all look like Brummbars on steroids and subs are clunky, but all are big enough to identify without squinting and to pick up without tweezers.

Fun stuff.

Overall, I really liked the game and once I really grasped some of the special attacks and things you could do, it was quite a hoot.

My only problem in the 2-player games I played, is that the thing that made the most difference was expanding territories by building submarines while maintaining some semblance of a defense.  Fighting was useful and done aplomb, but it was usually out of opportunity and never out of necessity.  

If there were more players, the production points would have been about the same to build, and there would have been less space to cram everything which would have made SO much of a difference in the overall game-play. 

TRADED - be damned if I can ever play this with anyone.  And this definitely isn't something I can find friends to casually pick-up.  It's just not a game that appeals to the casual "hey, lets try this" crowd of gamers or non-gamers.

...sigh.

I blame Risk.

Likes:
- The mini's for the game are really cool and the perfect size.
- I like the card mechanic for basically setting up what you can do on your turn, and in what order you will go.
- Very action packed game.  There is no room to turtle, so every turn is very intense.

Dislikes:
- Probably takes too long for what it is
- The combat system is eh.  Dunno if all the units balance out correctly.
- If you get ganged up on, there is zero chance of recovery.  Also has the gang up on the leader issue.

Notes:
- Feels like an average light war game.  Nothing to really get excited about even if it is a pretty good game overall

I LOVE the dust world, and think that the setting is wonderful.  Played with groups of 4 and 3.
I think that a larger group of players improves the play of this title.  We played the simple, shorter version both times.  

Nice components, clear rulebook, fun theme, I'd play this as a strategy game over A&A any day of the week!

RATING: 6
For all the carping about RISK and Axis & Allies that this site routinely offers, they sure seem to be the springboards of choice for game designers that want to develop their own light/medium-weight global domination games. RISK for the map, buckets o' dice combat, and card effects. Axis & Allies for special rules, variety of forces, and the expenditure of points for building economies and military units. DUST is a late example, like War on Terror, which makes these good game systems better--perhaps even great. If you are a fan of such games, add a point or two to this rating and add it to your collection.

...About the game itself: Like a lot of FFG products, the production values and bit count are both very high. Unlike a lot of FFG games, the rules are pretty tight and easy to learn while play is hampered only by (A/P) individuals who insist on mentally computing the odds and cost of every action available to them before taking any action. (A problem which exists in every A&A-type game). The theme is a bit specious for me (WWII in an alternate future) but, I am told, is really based on some sort of graphic novel/comic, but provides some necessary context for the lavish illustrations on the language-independent cards and player-aid charts. Otherwise, it could be whatever you want it to be. Finally, the point-track (while a bit anathema to AT gamers) keeps the game-length in check but is a poor indicator of which player is the leader. Come-back wins and king-making based on a beat-on-the-leader strategy are quite possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like it a lot, which kind of surprised me. The owner of the game said we played with the Designer's rules downloaded from the internet, not the one shipped by FFG. Pretty simple, but with some interesting twists (the cards, initiative, production...)

RATING: 7
Mix of Risk and Axis and Allies - with some wrinkles. Main change is use of cards for turn order, and you buy cards and units (like A&A). Card played determines when you go in a turn and what actions you can take, and a special action too. Lots of luck, but your choices of builds etc has a big influence. It's a multiplayer game, so negotiation is needed too. Overall, like it.

** Update - no love from main play group, ironically gathering dust

*** Update - traded (with some regrets)

Only played with the "Premium" version of the rules so far. 

Tactical, strategic, global war. Plays fairly fast for a game with such a grand scope. The victory point system wraps things up before you know it. 

The art and components are all top notch, coming with 800 plastic miniature models of tanks, aircraft, submarines and mechs! Based on a comic book, the same artist lends his hand to much of the art in the game. 

The build quality of the board is quite poor. I don't appreciate the puzzle-piece method of putting it together since they don't always fit smoothly, general assembly tends to ruin the edges. It's a big board, but not so big that it couldn't have been a fold-out. 

The theme itself is blown away (like so much dust?) as soon as the box cover comes off. It's all eyes on the map and pushing plastic around when the game begins. 

Combat is very simple and satisfying, using a hit-or-miss dice based system. Generally, the more units you bring to a fight the more dice you're going to get to throw during an assault. Strategies often pay off, but still allow for a good degree of chance, introducing at least some risk into every battle. 

What your able to do during a turn is established by a handful of cards that you collect throughout the game. The cards set your initiative, the number of times you can attack and move, and gives you a small resource bonus when building more units from your factories. On top of all that, these cards give you a special ability for the round, such as a missile assault, mech unit drops, diplomacy (temporary forced truces) and a handful of other abilities that mesh well with the games base rules and keep things interesting. 

Building up and defending factories is a good way to net yourself victory points.

DUST is to boardgaming what the Arnold Schwarzenegger picture COMMANDO is to film...it's totally stupid, derivative, and really kind of bad but it's also completely honest, unpretentious, and entertaining.  It's definitely a throwback to the Gamemaster-style games and as such it comes across like a slimmed-down AXIS AND ALLIES with a weirdo role selection/special power card mechanic to determine what all you can do in a turn.  A simple binary dice system (think HEROQUEST) gives combat results and there's definitely an emphasis on combined arms.  A kind of wonky production system is present and there's plenty of room for negotiation, alliances of convenience, and total hostility.  Strangely, the game feels really abstract despite all the imagery of girls in tanktops and Sherman tank/mech hybrids...there's not really a sense of time and place despite the fluff and it feels closer to the level of abstraction in RISK than may be comfortable.  It's a pretty fun game but I wouldn't pick it over NEXUS OPS or some of the more atmospheric games of this type.

Played a few games now. I quite like it, and this may be my "Ameritrash" game for a while. It has a cool theme, the cards that determine initiative plus the number of moves and attacks you can make during a turn is a cool mechanic. Plus, each card has a special ability which can add an interesting twist.

The comparison to [i]Risk[/i] being made by lots of people here is strange, as it's much closer to [i]Axis & Allies[/i], but more accessible since it can be played in much less time. And the people complaining that it's "too complicated" are hilarious. I cannot take you or your rating seriously if you are one of these people.

The "Premium" rules are recommended if you're looking for a faster game that should take no longer than about 2 hours.

RATING: 6
This is a pretty straight-forward hybrid of Axis & Allies and Risk, leaning toward the A&A end. That may sound like an insult, but it's not meant to be. Perhaps I should say that it "re-purposes systems" from that game? Anyway, it does add some interesting game mechanics, without really adding layers of complexity. They do this through the inclusion of character cards that provide special powers, which can help guide your own strategy or derail the strategy of your opponents. There are five different unit types, with some rock/paper/scissors relationships and a built-in system that promotes the use of combined arms. The artwork and production is amazing, but in practice, I felt like these things didn't translate into a solid thematic experience. BTW, there is a two-issue [i]DUST[/i] comic, that was available briefly in comic shops. If you are an uber-fan of this game, it's worth a look, mainly for the art. Anyway, it feels like the game accomplishes what it set it out to do and whether you will like it or not probably depends on whether you like the games it is influenced by.

This is a very likable game for all but the most surly dice and random element haters. It goes pretty fast if you use the short version rules. Nice elements are the cards which keep any player from just running away with the game. Well, unless that player gets all the good cards.

Combat is so simplified that players can (thankfully) ignore tactics that slow down decision-making and concentrate instead on what makes this game fun... fast, aggressive expansion at the expense of your opponents.

If you're not a fan of conquest games with lots of cool pieces and the crazy feeling you're not really in control then go play Puerto Rico and sit to the left of the new guy. That'll be fun.

We played our first game without using the "powers" of the cards, just kept to the attack, movement, and production values.  It was fun and played pretty quick.  As a "house rules" introductory technique, the game was very easy for us to learn.

Want to play this one some more.

Okay, played this one some more.  Still really enjoy playing it with my son.  Lot's of choices and tight victory point scoring.  The game plays really quick too.  Still avoiding use of the "powers" on the cards.

Risk goes SteamPunk World War Two-ish with ships, planes and special action cards. Risk had an European version with capitals and this game reintroduces capitals. Winner is determined by holding strategic locations, thus winning victory points. The one to score 40 victory points first - wins.

Nothing very new or original. There are indeed something I like, ie the decision on where put the production building (near the front for steady reinforce or in safer but more distant place), but there are some issues. The game cards mechanic is very unispiring and the cards special power range from useless to mighty powerful: teleport all your mechs everywhere in the map? You bet! Bombing production zones like factory or mine with little effort? Piece of cake. This is not the new risk, it's simply an ok game without clue with lots of pictures of prosperous women. 
Plain plain plain.

I like the thought but this game unfortunately comes up short. I feel like it could of been so much better than it turned out. The cards are fun, the resource and VP systems very simple yet more than adequate. In the end, the unbalanced nature of the map (all those Power Nodes around Africa) give a powerful advantage to the middle player while the "elite" units of the game either have broken mechanics (bombers) or are just not worth the cost (mechs). The game could of been a contender...

Definitely not Risk! If you take too long to get moving in this game, you miss your chance. The card based aspect is a nice twist, as is the turn-based scoring.

Especially enjoyable with larger groups, and never long enough to become tiresome (as Risk can become with seasoned players)

This is not a complex wargame, but neither a simple "Risk" style boardgame. If you look for a short game that can be played in an evening, with an easy rulebook, but also with interesting mechanics, limited importance of luck and lot of fun, this could be a good option.

I normally wait to add comments when I rate something.  But, I feel compelled to add for this one.  I loved the look and feel of this game when I read about it.  The theme sounded really cool and FFGs was doing it.  So, when I saw it at a FLGS I went ahead and paid full retail for it.

Well I RIPPED it open, literally.  The box was sooo tight that I would slide out the bottom.  When I put one of my fingers in the side the corner blew out.

I opened it up.  Looked like Risk.  After reading the rules, I felt no theme.  The art work seems to be very limited in the game and the rules just felt like a new version of Risk.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing a game of risk.  But, I just didn't feel like it was dripping with theme, the way it seems like it should.

Mine. Autoregalo 2016

Risk con un poquito de command & conquer y algunas cosillas especificas (mas variedad de unidades, ataques especificos que las utilizan, las unidades solo puedes sacarlas de donde tengas centros de produccion...) pero basicamente, es risk 2.0 tanto para lo bueno, como para lo malo. 

lo consegui a un precio practicamente insuperable. especialmente para las 800+ miniaturas que trae. 

el mapa "tipo puzzle"... es una pifia. no se en que pensaron para descartar el sistema normal de tablero plegable. pero con éste failearon. 

En resumen: es una puesta al dia (en 2009) del risk de toda la vida, con retoques jugables, cierto olorcillo a 4X (el minimo como para poder ser clasificado de tal), planteamiento futurista y una buena presentacion. 

pendiente de primera partida.

Played once with 6 people. It was everyone's first time playing. The game took 4-hours, but was cut short, sadly, because people gave up. I was one of the two who wanted to keep playing. 

World domination games always have balance issues, and it is easy for someone to suffer an irreversible setback if he is attacked multiple times in one round. In general I think the only available remedy for this is to protest loudly if a second person (let alone a third or fourth!) is going to attack you in the same round, and make an argument about how a balance of forces is preferable ("if you attack me, you'll weaken me so much that I won't be a threat to that other person over there, etc). But it's hard. 

I think Dust is a very well designed game. I love the forced "truce" rule. I like the retreat rule too. I especially like the cards: they fix all sorts of problems (eg turn order) and introduce a lot of balance in the game (I particularly like the forced alliance card, and the one that allows you to take any turn order). I'm glad I played it and I would definitely play it again.

A conquer the world game: production, movement and combat phases.
The cards are a clever mechanism and turn what could be an attack/axis and allies clone into something a bit more classy than plain risk... which is not much.
It is mostly an "ameritrash"; it is not revolutionnary, but feels like an old classic with the usual amount of luck thrown in. Of course, as such, it is a bit longish, and can even eat more time with the epic set-up.

I wanted to love this game - look at the fantastic theme and artwork! 
But I couldn't. 

The approach with first strike vs. standard units (see: Ikusa) doesn't get to really shine, maybe because there are too few dudes on the map, resulting in too much luck in battle. I must give it a few more plays, but just didn't fall in love so far. 
Tons of nice plastic minis.

Contrary to the box art, [i]there are no actual boobs involved in the gameplay.[/i]  I suppose you could just use the "magic of imagination" to see juddering mammaries bursting above the strained zippers of the sexy-small bomber jackets of the nubile tank commanders as they ride, straddling massive cannons, across the surging, curving hills and valleys.  You could, but it would take the same four-dimensional sudoku required for a Buddhist monk to imagine baby-stabbing while motor-boating a godlike pair offered up in a clench of lace.

RATING: 6
This game brings some interesting things to the table, but the combat system is a huge penalty in my opinion.  The heavy weighted nature of the first strike makes garrisoning areas, even important areas not an interesting choice.  Limiting non-combat movement also stops you from defending, you want to have large strike parties standing by.

I'd play again, but the category of light war game is crowded, and this doesn't even hit my top 5.

Similar to axis and allies, but with special powers based on the card you play.  They keep the game shorter by giving victory points, and having the game end when someone reaches a set amount of points.  The real interesting part is the card you play each turn, which gives you not only your special power, but how many moves/actions/buys you have for that turn.

Maybe i missed the boat and there is a super secret set of rules written somewhere that i didn't see...but this game is Risk with a different cover.  Not that i don't like Risk is just if i wanted to play Risk I'd play Risk.  Playing this game reminds me of when Vanilla Ice TOTALLY ripped of Queens Under Pressure and then had the balls to tell the court in the ensuing lawsuit that the two songs sounded completely different.  I hope Dust tactics isn't a complete rip off of Battle Tech or Warhammer but it would not surprise me if it was.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (July 2011)

What I really like about Dust is the card system, I think it allows for interesting decisions and it keep the game going on fluidly, other than that it is the same world domination game you already know but don’t get me wrong, the card system is a huge advantage over almost all games of its kind. The game comes with 130 miniatures per player (6 players) which I really love. 

On the bad side the game has paper thin theme (which is important to me). I can’t believe a Fantasy Flight Game has so little theme but Dust does :(. You don’t feel the world of Dust. It can take a long time to play it (even more with the Epic rules which I have not played yet).

Bottom line, I enjoy Risk like games so naturally I like Dust, I think it is the best (or near the top) of the light conflict war games.

It’s been 4 years since I last played Dust. In this period of time, my gaming tastes have changed a lot so I’m not sure if I still can enjoy the game. I will play it at least once more before deciding if I should get rid of it.

I finally played Dust again. I was expecting a bad experience but I was pleasantly surprised. I no longer bothered by the thin theme, however the cards add some uncontrollable luck to the mix. Sometimes it is very important to play first but you cannot so it is best to keep your 5 combat cards in reserve for emergencies. There is a lot of dice throwing so it adds to the luck factor.

Our last game took around 3 hours to finish which is fine and I didn’t feel them. It is neat that you have to reach a target VP for the game to finish so the game doesn’t take forever to finish.

The game components are very well done but the game really needed some player aids for the cards.

Bottom line, Dust is a borderline 6.0 to me. I enjoyed this game in my past but nowadays I almost never like direct conflict on this scale, the best strategy is to let other players attack first and then take over the weak links. I will keep the game for now in my game collection. I want to try the Epic variant.

Really, Really, Really wanted to like this one. Tried it with 2-4 players.

Two players it seemed the first person to successfully attack was the winner. They have the advantage of a full strength army, then the second player has to counter with a patched up army, most likely not producing a lot of units.

Three players suffered from the same issue as the two player, with the third player being able to watch the other two slug it out and get strong in the process,

Four players improved it, but still not enough to keep it.

The only game I've ever known where my knowledge of geography ruined the experience for others.  The major draw of the game (apparently) for the friend that bought it was that the old nations and locations had all been deleted from the map.  Long gone in a sea of dust.  I still needed something to refer to the spaces by, so I ended up calling them by their real world names, which drove my friend nuts.

Rating based on one playing with 4 players.  Only one of us had played before, and we played the special ability cards wrong for the first two rounds.

Light, faster playing version of Axis and Allies.  The choice of card to play, and which units to buy is critical in this game.  Gaining the initiative is crucial, as you can attack first and take away the opponents ability to produce units to counter attack.  And while some reviewers state you can catch up if you fall behind, it's very unlikely that you will, as you will lose your production centers, and thus your ability to produce the units needed to gain VPs.

Better than risk, not as good as the revised (2004) Axis and Allies.

Nice game with beautiful board and good pieces.  It is easy to learn and the cards give it a lot of re-playability.

The cards special rules leaves somethings up for debate, so be carefully applying them!

A grand world domination war game. In many regards similar to Risk, but without the long gameplay. In this game you are limited to a certain amount of Victory Points.

Being a huge fan of RISK, Axis and Allies and Twilight Imperium I knew I was going ot love this game when I picked it up, and after my first play i was right. This is a great game. Takes a bit longer than 3 hours for the Premier rules, at least it did with our group all of whom were experienced gamers. I look forward to playing it again and eventually trying the EPIC version.

We had six players on our first game, so it felt quite epic, it would be a perfect 10 but for the fairly large downtime between turns.

Does a pretty great job of being Risk but better. While I got it as a good fit for my group, I was pretty skeptical before playing because Risk Legacy bored me and I worried that maybe I was just over the light world conquest dice game. Not so, Dust is alot of fun. Wouldn't dare bring it to the public meetup though. Its a game of shit-talking, taunting, frantic pleading diplomacy, and shouting at dice with everyone standing up to watch a big roll. 

Dust ended up being replaced by Starcraft, which is the same type of game except alot more interesting.

Giving it an 8,5 after the first play. I really enjoyed it. Takes one evening if you play with at least 4 people, even with premium rules really. This game goes deeper than it looks. The power sources system is great, the roles are great (could use at least some text on the cards though) and the bits are awesome ! Actually doesn't take long to setup, I personally don't like puzzle gameboards though.
The game also feels very balanced thanks to the nice (and simple) scoring system, people can't fall back too far in a short period of time to a lost position, which makes it enjoyable for everyone (unlike games like shogun (happens now and then) and especially risk where you can be just sitting there and watch not having fun).
A great game between Risk and Axis and Allies, and absolutely my favorite of these ! The theme is a bit odd, I can't see what chicks have to do in a nuclear war age but ah well ;)

Granted we did not have anyone at the table who had played before but the game dragged as we looked up rules. The theme is rather generic and weak and well there is nothing here that nexus ops doesn't do better and faster. 

My rating may be a bit on the low side but I don't really see the potential for this to rise much above a 6.

Meh.  I guess this is an OK simple wargame.  But I found offense to be so over-powered that attempting to a long-term strategy was pointless.  This just highlights a problem I have with many new games (e.g., 1960) that (in an attempt to prevent "turtling") remove a whole category of thought from the game.

Very nice minis, interesting strategic options, have played with 3 and probably even better with 4 or 6. Now played with 4 and definitely better. Seems well balanced as we all had the lead at some point in the game . Every turn is a trade-off between building up or expansion and if you over-stretch yourself there will be a few turns of getting beaten back down. Fairly bloodless combat system except between large equal forces....combat supremacy is crucial. Major question mark over set-up with 4 or 5 players.

A favorite of a few of the players in my game group.  I enjoy it as well as I'm a sucker for sci-fi themes, and you can never go wrong with mechs.  I've never done a good job of recording plays but this is the second most played game in my group.

One play, premium rules. Basically exactly what it claims to be; Risk meets Axis & Allies (Rev. Ed.) with some really neat additional mechanics. I could see this going up with more plays, especially after trying the epic rules that are supposedly better. My biggest complaint is that the totally awesome theme is only marginally felt beyond art work and back story in the rules.

Lust for bits got the better of me. Haven't played it yet though. People want to play Risk.

"This is like Risk," I say, "but better."
"Better than Risk? That sounds a bit too exciting for us. Can we just focus on what we know?"
"You mean, not take a risk? You see the irony."
"No, I just see 15 armies at the start of my turn and gameplay that extends into the small hours."
"Well, I've just bought the new, shorter Risk."
"That sounds unfamiliar. We don't like unfamiliar."
"No, no, it's pretty much the same as old Risk, but with the hope of ending some time before my next significant birthday."
"Okay, let's play that... wait... what are the pointy things, and where are my cavalry?"

If I had to choose just one Risk type game to play this definitely would be it. Wait, it is. Despite all the numerous themes and variants out there Dust has everything and gets it right which I want from this kind of game. Great theme and components, tense gameplay, thanks to the VP based victory condition and the action cards. I'm not too fond of the puzzle board and the cards could use some text, but those are just minor annoyances. 
Recommended for kids over 9.

I wasn't extremely impressed with Dust but that's perhaps only because I don't love these types of conquer games.  I did like the hand-management and their inherent constraints (number of moves, attacks, etc.).  It's quite a tactical game and one well-fought battle at the right time can really swing the game (NOTE: losing a big battle early can really put you in a position that's difficult to recover from).  I appreciate the simplicity of the battles and most importantly that there's somewhat of a built-in clock in that each round a number of points will be given out and the game will be over once someone meets the point-criteria.  Unfortunately some of the special actions are unbalanced, the theme is really weak and the publisher cut some corners in the game's production (ugly as sin player aides and card pictures which could have benefited from some really cool manga graphics).  UPDATE:  Played again and found out that the board is too tight with 6-players.  Someone will get knocked out early and that's no fun.

Some similarities to Risk, but with multiple different unit types and game won by victory points and not player elimination.  Each player plays a card at the beginning of the turn to determine turn order, number of movement actions, combat actions, and extra production points obtained that turn.  Cards also each have a unique ability, which can be used once per turn.  Lots of dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fantastic components, mechanics that seem to merge Axis & Allies with Risk... I enjoyed the six-player "premium" game we played (note that the box also included a separate rulebook for the "epic" game), but I did feel like there was a runaway leader problem, and the game seems to unfairly reward an advantage to the first player in the pre-game city and production center placement which extends far into later turns. I would definitely play this again, but compared to games like War of the Ring and Game of Thrones, it just didn't seem to pack as much of a punch.

RATING: 3
The game has great art, and I was initially excited to play it for that reason. Unfortunately, I did not find it very well integrated into the game. The pictures on the cards don't reveal enough about the impact they have on your actions in the game. Further, my group did not find the cards well balanced vs each other. Players that drew a hand of more powerful cards did well, and those that didn't needed to spend actions looking for those cards or lose. We liked the forced player interaction (via required proximity to at least 1 neighbor). The flip side of that is it was very easy to have more than one player hit hard enough early in the game to minimize them for the duration. This is counter to the claimed lack of player elimination in game. While players really aren't eliminated, they may as well be for all the enjoyment they will get as a last place chew-toy for the rest of the game. The overwhelmingly most effective combat tactic of building a giant stack of troops and daisy-chaining it across the board reduced the game to more of a race than a tactical battle. Whoever starts with or finds the correct cards to build the troops and propel them wins. It takes much too long to complete when so much depends on the random elements.

RATING: 7
I'm not a huge fan of Risk clones, but this one definitely stands out in terms of mechanics and theme. Good production quality, but functionality is slightly impeded by cards which do have nice graphics, but otherwise don't tell you what their effects are (I actually had to make a summary sheet in order to make the game playable for new players). Other than that, it's a well-designed light strategy game with a strong theme and immersive gameplay.

This is a possible buy for me.

UPDATE:  Rating drop.  Dust blows.

Really?  In 2007-08 we're presumably to be all in a lather about this strategy game retread?  Hadn't any of the designers previously played the brilliant Nexus Ops?  We're reinventing the wheel again?  Sigh.

Dust isn't bad, not by a long shot.  It's just not solidly good, either.  It's got some great ideas and mechanics that just don't deliver as a whole.  Since there are too many important spaces to defend, the game simply becomes about grabbing as much as possible each turn before the winner tops maximum VP.  And the game that does that best is End of the Triumvirate.  With Dust, Risk starts seeming fresh and new.  Oh, the irony!

Most distressingly, the theme is as thin as a layer of...well, it's shockingly thin, given the oustanding artwork, unit models, and presentation.  But I would have (reluctantly) done without so many busty ladies in the artwork and for some deeper theming.  It's Supremacy all over again.  Just what we needed!

I write this with regret.  Dust could have been a dazzlingly new innovative strategy title.  And we need a few!

RATING: 6
Another in the long line of produce units and take-spaces-for-VPs games. You're aiming to hold capitols and VP spaces, and there are bonuses for holding the most production spots, the most land spots and the most sea spots. So it's usually obvious what to do - produce lots, get big attacks going so you'll get initiative (first roll) plus enough dice to wipe out the opponent's troops before they get to roll themselves (ie don't lose units unnecessarily that you'd then have to re-build), and make sure there are easier targets to hit than yourself by the time you finish. The round starts by each player sim-revealing a card which defines their moves, their combats (most goes first) and their production for the turn, as well as a special power they get for the round, like re-rolls or a missile attack. On your turn, produce units, do your moves, then do your combats (ie adjacent attacks). At the end of the round, score VPs, and do it all again until someone hits the VP-win target. There's lots of downtime so this is best played with fewer players. The combat is fine and usually over in a roll or two (any hit on a die, at 1 in 3, will suffice to destroy a unit, so initiative is enormous). There's massive hit-the-leader and king-making potential so don't emotionally invest. There's a bunch of wibbles once you get into it, with undefended fleet strikes and then bombers taking out fleets, but most of the action is in the land battles for VP spots. Most of the decision making is in what type of unit to produce and where. As a game, it's nicely produced and works fine for the dice-and-die genre it's aiming at. For me, there's just too little to think about and do when it's not your turn to make me want to replay often. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Yes, the dreaded Risk comparisons will rear their ugly heads.  But I hate Risk, and I don't hate this as much.  The flexibility of movement is a signficant piece of that.  Another is having to maintain production sites in addition to resource sites.  Still, wouldn't want to play it often.

Rating is in a holding pattern.  Beautifully produced game although the artwork in the rules is way too cheesey.

Gameplay is very solid, clean and fun, for the most part.  The game is over too quickly though...someone jumps into the lead and no one can catch up, so they scramble to hit the capital.  Maybe the 2p game is bad but for 3 or more it works better.  Hard to say.

A Big improvement on Risk, with some nice little wrinkles.

I took a risk on this game and purchased this game as a more advanced Risk game. The dice have 4 blank sides and 2 sides with target symbols and every time you roll a target you have a hit. There is no greater joy being attacked by a huge army and then demolishing them by rolling 4 dice and getting targets on all 4! "Howz that yowza!". What the game does lack is a high level of strategy due to the dice and the cards control and abilities. It is a shame you have to prioritise on building large armies, moving and attacking other players and not in the sense of strategy but in the limitation the cards give you. It understandable why, but it is too limited and really lengthens the game. More fun is seeing the frustration of your opponent when you use a powerful special power, changing the balance of the game, but this does go against the war strategic genre! Love the theme and pieces though and I am not even a comic book fan. I would have kept this game despite what I have said, however the decider was the long playing time.

Didn't make the cut- as war is dam tough!

RATING: 7
I am sure there will be the inevitable comparisons to Risk. 
However, I believe Dust is more beholden to A&A and TI3 than to Risk.
Why?
Yes combat uses the BOD (Bucket of Dice) method, but look at all the other components.
The forces have 5 different unit types each with its own cost and abilities.  
Production is driven by controlling industry centers and resource points. The action cards drive several things:
Turn Order
Additional production points
Movement actions, which are generous- you can move through areas as long as you are not blocked by units or terrain.
Combat actions: The main feature is being able to reactivate an area you just attacked.
Special feature ability - like automatic victory, reroll dice...
The resource/capitals are the victory locations so you objective is to control a few more than the other players so you are ahead on the victory curve.
The game is weighted to the attack and practically begs you to bash a neighbor. 
All in all it is a fun game with some light strategy. 
You should consider it when you want to beat up on your playing partners.

800+ plastic minis? Don't mind if I do. I love games with lots of pieces and Dust has more than just about any other game that I can think of that you can still learn to play in under 30 minutes. Artwork a bit risqué perhaps, but doesn't distract me from the game play too much.

One of the best "dudes on the map" game I have come across. A bit longish and requires 4+ players to work which means it won't hit the table very often. Also the genre only works for a certain type of people.

Yet another strategic/tactical multi-player game from FFG. All the usual trappings of clever card driven elements and various bits and pieces of plastic. The game has a very clever combat mechanic which actively encourages aggressive actions, it also creates a very unstable dynamic to the game. That unstable dynamic is something you either like or loathe, it means the game has plenty of opportunity for dramatic blitzkrieg attacks and maneuvre but also that alliances dominate as a player has no real hope of outfighting two opponents.

A passable risk improvement, but I can't imagine wanting to play this over a number of similar games. The VP system means it is too easy for a player to get knocked out of the running early on in the game.

Not the best "ameritrash" out there but not bad either. Fixed turn number keeps the game time short. Some flaws but I enjoyed playing this game.

Fun, tense and confrontational game about war in an alternate present, with a kind of [i]Mad Max[/i] setting and some Russians, Nazis, Aliens and good looking girls thrown in.  It is often compared with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181]Risk[/url][/i], and even when I can see why, the game is different enough in so many ways to sustain the comparaison.  For me, it feels a lot more like [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22038]Warrior Knights[/url][/i], because of the scoring system and the way players play cards with orders that will be executed later, even when the model of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29109]Dust[/url][/i] is based on the military units and not on the leaders (Knights), like the other.  This comments are based on the Premium version of the rules.

RATING: 6
I think Dust is very Risk-like, no matter what anyone says. Although there are two sets of rulebooks, Epic and Premium (the names sure are grand), this is more of a joke as both are essentially the same (with Epic rules the playing time is a lot longer without anything that really justifies this).

Out of the box the rules are in a few places somewhat unclear and the game has a few design problems which seriously hurt it.
I do like the visual look and the fact that there are only a few tokens and not hundreds (like in many games these days). The special abilities in the cards work well and give nice variation.

House rules I suggest:
1) Everyone does their production in the order the cards dictate. After all players have done this you proceed to move/combat normally.
2) New units can only be placed next to production centers (maximum of 5 units/turn).
3) One army can attack only once per turn.

RATING: 7
Wow, a nice little bash-em-up.  While certainly not the kind of game that I want to play all the time, it is great for its genre.

I've got to say that this game succeeds where most others of its kind fail.  First, and this is a big one, there is nothing annoying about the game.  That's really saying quite a bit as opposed to most of these kinds of games where you wish that there would be a fix for one thing or another.  

It is compared to Risk, and I guess that this is somewhat understandable, but really this game has so much more going for it.  There are real strategic and tactical decisions.  The role selection is nice, the battle resolution is quick and clean, and the map is engaging.

This is the game that people that wish Axis and Allies were as good as they remember it to be should play.  Unlike A&A, It has the distinct advantage of being short enough to play in an evening, and doesn't outlast its welcome... unless you are crazy enough to play the epic version.  Mostly this ends right when it should.  

The game works well with three and I can imagine four could be fun, but I wouldn't play it with more.

One of the few games of this kind that I don't think that Nexus Ops makes obsolete.  There is enough individual character here that justifies its existence.  I just wish that there was more theme here.  This could really use an expansion set to infuse the sense of place (Alien Technology and some extra nonsense).  It could use more special powers.

All in all, if you want to march plastic troops around a board this will scratch the itch.

UPDATE: NOT FOR 6.  Downtime can be extreme and one person is gonna get hosed.  Seems perfect for four.

It's clearly in the extended risk family, but the scifi setting frees play from historical expectations. Having said that, the theme is not especially heavy. It's fun and not overly long.

RATING: 8
I think this is a better game than it gets credit for. I'm interested primarily in how the game plays, so won't get into the debate about how it does or does not bring the theme to life.

The most direct comparison would be to the better Risk games, e.g. [GAMEID=1829], or to the [GAMEID=98] family. The physical presentation is outstanding, and the game play is interesting.

I've only played the Premium rules, the shorter of the two rule sets provided, and am not really interested in the longer Epic version. If I'm going to spend that much time, I'd rather choose something deeper. But for a 2-3 hour conquer the world slugfest, with interesting decisions to be made both strategically and tactically, Dust Premium is one of the best.

can't help myself, but for what it is supposed to be, I find it great! Fine 'themed', nice layout, loads of pieces, kind of easy ‘global armies’ luck-fest  with at least some strategy needed to succeed..

Risk like game about conquest but a far superior game with more strategy in the cards and 6 differing combat units; the use of activated Production Centres to mine and produce combat forces Combine this with a neat VP scoring system 1 VP for every City and Resource area under your control and a first to 40 / 50 VP and you have a close game that immediately kicks off from the start and only lets up after about 5 rounds.

Played for the first time, simple, decent game as a variation of risk. not really too much difference in the versions however.  neat little pieces, cards are a fun variation as well.  I wont play it much and be moving on to the next board game shortly though.  Glad I got the reduced price on it though. 
Second time, 4 players, much more fun Moving the rating up!

RATING: 2
Rating based on a single play. And probably the only time I will play this game. Too many dice for my liking, and some of the action cards are outrageously powerful... bordering to ridiculous. And the worst downside to that, is that the cards are drawn randomly. So some people may draw cards that singlehandedly can win the game for them, or at least give a BIG hand to the effort. On top of this, its very possible to end up in a surefire losing position, and nothing to do but wait for the game to end. In an hour or two...
We played the "Fantasy Flight" edition of the game, which in my view has to be the most tolerable of the two. Epic games should be much longer... but the game is already much too long for what it is. I will not be caught dead playing this again.

RATING: 7
Dust has all of the essential parts needed for a classic "Risk-like" world domination game - and manages to fit it all within 2 hours (four players). A very clean design, I find that it has just enough complexity to be intersting while still being very streamlined. A really fun game, but it needs a few house rules and player aids to shine. Underrated.

After looking at my gaming closet, it was clear this would never hit the table. Too much other, better, options vying for the same spot (light multiplayer wargame): Risk (because we don't have to explain rules, ever), Shogun, A Game of Thrones and even Axis and Allies (which is also on the trade pile).

Sold off. Didn't even make it out of the shrink-wrap. Shame, but you can't play/own everything!

Great Risk type of game. I have played almost all versions of risk and risk type of games. This one is probably one of the best. Great components (the plastic pieces are amazing, the board could have been a better one (instead of the "puzzle" form that it has), and the cards are great. The cards drive the whole game. Excellent mechanism. It is a 2-hour game, but it is not boring and has a nice scoring system that generates more aggression and also ends the game in a "timely" way.

Only two plays so far. It looked awesome, from the units to the dice, but once we set up and started to play, it wasn't that exciting.

I will give it a fair chance with more players and would like to try the Epic rules at least once.

See, this is what I wanted Risk to be.  It's World domination, with luck - but a time device, cool pieces, and a neat card system.  Best with six.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Thought this would be closer to Risk than it actually is. Sure, you have a map of the world, loads of dice and a mission to conquer, but that is where similarities end as far as I am concerned. Dust is really about gathering the maximum number of victory points each turn (no need to build op huge bulkheads), selecting the right tactical cards, and optimizing the combinations of different troop types. All in all, quite a bit more tactical than "classic" Risk.
Although the 40 VP game limit ensures that the game actually comes to an end, I do find that even the "Premium" variant of the game takes quite some time to play - even more than the 3 hours mentioned on the box. Another minus is that the rulebook is quite big. The rules are not complex, there are just quite a lot of them (which may put some players off). Still, love to play again sometime soon!

This game has mold on the back of the board and I have a mold alergy.I do not understand why manufacturers are making their printed material in tropical, high humidity climates like China. In these countries mold grows on paper while it is being printed unless the printer takes very special measures to stop it.Its OK to get plastic bits from China as their production has no mold related problems but the printed material has.I am very disappointed with Fantasy Flight and the other manufacturers who have had mold problems this year. I have posted a comment on their Dust forum about this problem but they have as yet failed to respond.

I haven't played risk since I was 6 or 7 years old, so I can't say anything to comments about Dust's similarities to that classic. I do agree the game universe is cool but the game doesn't take enough advantage of its grim backstory. Still this game has seen the table more than any other game I own.

Yes, it's Euro babes go to war.  If the enemy looked so good, who'd want to fight?  A step up from vanilla Risk in a good way.  Defined unit types improve the game but in the end it's still an all out slugfest.  Good Ameritrash.

Risk, with much more strategy and choices.  Fairly complex for non-wargamers, but the gameplay mechanics are learned quickly.  Learning strategies may take a few plays.  One downside is that it's somewhat unforgiving - if you make mistakes early and lose enough areas and military units, you can be hopelessly out of the game, although you cannot be eliminated.  Otherwise, a fun game with very exciting combat that keeps everyone involved.  Oh, and the bits are wonderful!

I REALLY love this game... and its not just the fact that I am undefeated at it.  The game (Premium edition rules - haven't tried Epic yet) plays clean and smooth with little downtime and plenty of difficult decisions to make.  Sure its got a high luck factor(not a bad thing in my group) but its not so random as Battue and you still feel like a victory was  more due to your strategy than your dice rolling.  I like it better than Nexus Ops and thats saying alot.  The puzzle-like board is... well... a bit puzzling and really unnecessary.  And there really should have been a reference sheet for the different card abilities... but these are minor quibbles.  Excellent game that plays fast and clean.  Maybe not elegant but it feels tighter than most other risk-style games.

Seems like fun, but it really needs a huge THEME injection. It's got a pretty venere but that's about it. The factions need powers - The Germans need a Technological Edge - The Alliance (UK+USA) need superior combined forces... etc etc. 

This game So needs some Unique special powers and a Research Track... I'm working on some ideas but who knows if I'll ever finish/post them.

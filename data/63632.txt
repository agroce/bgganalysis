Beautiful board, with one horribly pasted on theme! It's a good brain-burner of a game, though, that should appeal to those who are both mathematically inclined and are blessed with a good memory. It's well balanced, and it is not a certainty by any stretch of the imagination as to who has won until the very end......perhaps TOO well balanced?

Essen 2010 acquisition.  This was a very negative experience.  Area majorities game.  Play early and you get extra cubes.  Then wait and watch the other players play more than you into the area to claim.  One area can be protected with a baron.  Cubes stay the board from round to round, so the dynamism of similar placement games like Pillars is missing.  In the middle three rounds certain areas are wiped out.  More negativity as was the court intrigue where you can take a prestige point from an opponent.  It would be fair to say the game had little tweaks to make it work and reasonably balanced, it just lacked any fun factor and I was glad when it finished.

Majority game with a good idea on how to convert "victory points" into a tower, which actually gives the real victory.  It takes the card action idea from El Grande, and has some nice additions, but I found it to be quite unconfortable to play.  The board is just crowded, there are 16 different zones to look at!  I did not really enjoy, although it is not a bad game nor has a wrong concept.  It can have big AP.

This is a fine area control game, with nothing truly innovative, but with very polished mechanics and balance: everything works well, and the game has the right lenght for its weight. The production is good (but the towers could've been nicer), thanks to the efforts of the artists who painted the board. The theme is of course almost non-existant.

First Play, 2 Players: Totally missed the 2 player variant rules so played our our special variant. Still enough to appreciate the subtlty of the game and the clever mechanisms to bring players back in from back pegging. 

Very quick but very strategic, I imagine this can be brutal with 4 players. Looking forward to next play.

Secoond play with 4. The game really shines with a full compliment but the balance holds out brilliantly and final results are close. Rating improved

2010. area ctrl/majorities & auctions. Wow, this is a painful area control game.  I'm not a fan of area control, and this one has massive piles of cubes pitted against each other with little ability to move/change cube locations.  The best way to play is probably piling cubes in an area just after that area's one-time cube-killing event has taken place since you know the cubes are safe... but the game is just long and not much fun.  The leader-pays-more cost structure is a nice catch-up mechanic but simply encourages 2nd/3rd place players to ride coat-tails and then collude and pounce (leader-bash) in the last round, which can be annoying.

Others say: possible king-making issues, cut-throat, shorter & lighter than El Grande with favorable comparisons to mechanics in Louis XIV and Royal Palace.

Juego de mayorías. El objetivo es construir la torre más alta. Hay roles que se subastan al principio del turno. Cada uno te va a aportar una serie de cubitos que se han de colocar en las distintas zonas del tablero. Cada zona reportará diferentes recompensas a quien tenga la mayoría. Después se construye la torre con puntos de prestigio. El precio de cada sección es variable.. siempre es piso+1, salvo el primero en construirlo que tiene que pagar un "añadido" y es piso+2.

Es sencillito y entretenido, aunque no da para hacer planificación a largo plazo. Hasta cuatro jugadores. hora y media de duración. Vale para pasar un rato.

A lesser version of El Grande. Area control with nothing new. 

The cubes just sat there. Nothing dynamic. Top that off with some random event cards.

The game art looked pretty. But theme could have been anything. It could have been called "Philadelphia" or anywhere else for that matter.

RATING: 6
The only thing that might not work in the game's favor is that it seems to me like there's no way to pull ahead in score by playing better than the others, since they'll all team up against you. So most games will be decided on the last turn when it's more of a free for all.

RATING: 5
Overall, Jerusalem is an area majority game, where the various areas either get you more guys (which you can use next turn to add to regions), get money (which can be spent on guys and turn order), or points.  It's really about that simple: auction for turn order, place guys, and get your stuff.  The fun twist comes in the form of an event at the end of each turn, which generally kills guys on the board, usually with a provision that allows you to save some of them at a cost.

It's a serviceable area majority game, but with all the other area majority games out there, I'm not sure I'd choose this one.  With the thousands of game choices out there these days, an "OK" game just doesn't pass muster any more.

RATING: 4
Jerusalem has little to no redeeming features and almost no characteristic to truly call its own compared to the other majorities games in existence. The majorities are simply [i]only[/i] majorities: nothing is handed out for being in second of third place. This turns the entire game into a boring exercise of hitting hard on the other players and hoping that you manage to take your turn later rather than earlier. Leeching strategies are useless here: it is all turn order and very straightforward resource management. Finally, the board is too much form over function because the important icons have been relegated towards a small corner; and have been given colours which make them difficult to discern.  

All in all, Jerusalem appears to be a carefully executed vision which arrived at least 5 years too late. I see no reason to play this game if any of the token majority games is available; and that seals its fate for me. I should add that the game appears in no way bad or disfunctional; and that you shouldn't shun from playing it if it is all you've got. The question is rather: when are you in a position that Jerusalem is all you've got?

RATING: 8
A very good area control game - it's reminiscent of both Royal Palace and Louis XIV, but plays better than both of them.  Your decisions are few but crucial - so you aren't struggling for eons trying to make a choice.

The board is gorgeous, the gameplay is quick, and it's easy to learn.  I am not a fan of serious direct conflict, so this game works well for me - light conflict where you must be certain to watch what your opponents are up to.

UPDATE: This game is far more interesting with 4 players, as the auction becomes heated (especially later in the game) and you have a lot more to guard against.  It's so much better I question if I'll ever want to do the 2-player version again.

 In this game, players will be trying to control key areas in the city of Jerusalem. These areas will provide different resources that they will use to expand their power by building their castle tower. The player that can grow their prestige and thereby their tower the highest will be declared the winner.

Decent majority game, but there are a few drawbacks which place this a long run behind El Grande and even San Marco in my opinion. Biggest disadvantage for me is the not only slightly overcrowded board in the endgame combined with an almost calculable behaviour of the opponents, which gives room for major analysis paralysis,

A short way to describe Jerusalem: The winner takes it all.

That's not uncommon in area majority games but it becomes problematic here because there are few restrictions on where followers can be placed, and you place all followers at once in turn order. This basically means the player(s) at the back decide which areas to take over and results in pretty chaotic turns. The game has a couple of rules to alleviate this effect (players earlier in turn order get more resources; you can lock one region per turn) but they mostly serve to show that the underlying design needs fixing.

To a lesser extent I also disliked the very coarse-grained scoring. You need to spend influence points to build tower levels which double as victory points. The only reason this additional conversion step exists is that being the first to build to a new level is slightly more expensive.

A nice looking game, but lacks anything special in the way of an area control game.  If you own El Grande, you probably can do without it.  In our game everyone ended with the same number of tower blocks, so the prestige point tie-breaker gave me the win.  Nothing very satisfying overall.

This game surprised me! From the initial info and graphics I expected a dry euro-style game. Which it kinda is, but man, with loads of tactics and player interaction!

You can basically screw your opponents if you can/want to, or you can try to survive in a District (protected by your Baron), just barely overpowering that previous player who thought he would have the majority there...

Even if the components are typical euro-style (wooden cubes and big "sliced" cubes forming the tower + cardboard money and a pawn), the game is nicely illustrated and after a bit of getting used to it also easy to comprehend. 

This is all after playing one game, so take it with a grain of salt, but already in this first game I gained sort of a "feeling" for the game and the many strategies and tactics you can/must employ, if you want to emerge victorious in the end.

True, there is a luck factor in the Action cards, but that is only a minor quibble for those who do not like luck in their games. The only other thing is the auction for the roles, but also this is an interesting aspect.

Overall, thumbs up!

Area control that has some pleasant reminders of El Grande. What it really lacks compared to that game is the elegance - this one is for gamers only, while I've had good success teaching the big G as a "next-step" game. Not sure if the tower building bash-the-leader mechanism is a good thing or a bad thing. A bad level of hidden-but-trackable info for my tastes... not so much of that you can not bother caring about it, but too much of it to have a genuinely good feel for.

Nothing new here. NOTHING! I've seen and I've played many many (too many) same kind of area control/influence games which is the reason why I'm not excited here.

The typical "push the colored cubes" Euro; the kind of game because of which the Euros got their bad reputation. It's finely balanced and nice, but dry as hell, and doesn't provide any great new ideas, any new idea that would have justified its existence. I can't say it's a bad game as it certainly isn't. I can't say you don't have interesting or hard decisions here. The game might be even *too* unforgiving as there is no 2nd place scoring anywhere. I still didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.

The game was a nice majority game with some new concept. 

One great things of this game is like you have to grow in area turn by turn but having the possibility, going early in the turn, to protect an area you really would like to preserve.

You need to know the event cards before playing (but it is not a problem since are really few).

The decision about which Office to bid about is tense. 

The graphic and material are nice and the mechanic work good. 

Not really an innovative game but a game fun to play. Best in 4 players.

08/15/10 Played a three-player game.
I had a problem with the artwork on the office and event cards. They are 70% artwork. This leaves only 20% at the top and 10% at the bottom to cram in a bunch of tiny icons. As to the game board, yes, the art looks nice. But superimposed on this are icons in certain places. Often these tan squire icons and brown tower/prestige icons blend into the background, which is often tan and/or brown as well.  
As for the mechanics, I liken Jerusalem to El Grande, but with a *great* deal more chaos. 
Jerusalem isn't a bad game, but as majority control games go I've played several better ones. The level of chaos rankled me. Basically no place is safe. And as I mentioned earlier, I feel the publisher placing artwork before icon clarity on the board and cards is unforgivable. I rated it a "5". We speculated its probably better with a full compliment of four. If so, I might raise my rating to a six. Maybe.

Jerusalem is like El Grande but not as good. Instead of power cards you auction the turn order things. Going last is usually good, even though you add less stuff to the board. You only get any benefit if you're in 1st place.

There are 3 random events in the game that totally devastate about 20% of the board. I got hit hard by 2 of these, conclusion: random events suck.*

Also it's got hidden but trackable info, but that is a minor complaint next to the events. 

*EDIT - I got a PM from the designer, looks like the person teaching got the rules wrong. I've raised my rating from a 4 to a 5.

Decent Majority Game. That being said: Because of the inflation of the cubes the later rounds are prne to analysis paralisys. And that doesnt fit to the huige "Chaos" factor - you have to count a lot, but you cant predict anything, since you dont know how many cubes the other players can put on the board.
Will play again if asked, but I dont think its for me.

Un gioco di maggioranze che ha molto in comune con El Grande (ma tutti i giochi di questo tipo devono fare i conti col mostro sacro di Kramer). Dimenticati l'orticello, Jerusalem è un titolo "cattivo" con molta interazione, e sia l'ordine di piazzamento che i privilegi dei personaggi sono ben pensati: piazzo per primo e ho la prima scelta sulle zone che mi interessano, o lo faccio per ultimo decidendo quali maggioranze andarmi a prendere? L'alea (delle carte evento e azione) rende il gioco meno prevedibile e il piazzamento meno "freddo". 
Infine, è ottima sia la meccanica di costruzione dei piani della torre, che compatta il gruppo obbligando chi è più avanti a spendere di più, che la sua giustificazione a livello di ambientazione (pagherò di più perché sono il primo fare una cosa del genere).

Mi è piaciuto meno il fatto che, al di fuori del suo turno, un giocatore non debba far altro che attendere e l'impossibilità per chi è in testa di bloccare il palazzo del Re col proprio Barone: questa eccezione è l'unico neo in un complesso di regole molto elegante. Peccato, perché è un caso particolare che va ricordato continuamente durante il gioco (ma immagino che ciò sia stato introdotto per questioni di bilanciamento). 

Infine, qualche considerazione personale che non influisce sul mio voto. Primo: ho particolarmente apprezzato la qualità grafica delle carte personaggio e dell'iconografia utilizzata, ma mi è piaciuta meno quella di alcune zone del tabellone con i palazzi (come il Patriarcato e la torre di David) che sembrano fotografie photoshoppate. Secondo: ho trovato le dimensioni del tabellone un po' sproporzionate rispetto all'uso che se ne fa. Terzo: sospetto che il gioco funzioni al meglio in quattro giocatori, non di meno. Quarto: vorrei approfondire il discorso longevità, per cui mi rifarò vivo dopo un po' di partite.

In ogni caso la valutazione è positiva.

Straight-forward worker-placement excercise, polished flow. There's not much brainstorming to be done, as straight-forward "grabbing as much points as possible to be able to build the tower as much as possible"-strategy is the best - no side-ways to get to the victory. Best thing is that it is suitable for whole family.

RATING: 6
Another area control game. This one has auctioning for role selection (with turn order tradeoff), action and event cards, temporary blocking of regions (via barons), and varying benefits for winning each region. These benefits include more workers, money, or building points. Nothing new, in fact most of the mechanics are implemented more poorly here than in other similar games (Mammoth Hunters, Kreta, Dominant Species, El Grande, etc.). The cards are limited in number and variability, catch up and balancing mechanics remove what little strategy there might have been, the theme is pasted on, and the artwork and board were uninspiring (as with the components - e.g. flat, square blocks for palace towers, and standard cubes for workers/squires). Can be played chaotically or via slow calculation. We failed to find an enjoyable game in here.

1 play, 4er

It's all area-control all the time! And a little auction. I generally like area control, but this needed something more. It does have a very clever VP mechanism, but not enough other stuff going on to make it interesting. I prefer El Grande, although even that is a bit dry. Maybe I most prefer 2-player area majority games (Twilight Struggle, anyone?)?

Oh, I also did HORRIBLY coming in a distant last place -- that may be coloring my view of the game, so I'd certainly play this again if someone else chose it.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is a pretty pure area majorities game, with a few twists thrown in. The conversion of build points to VP (i.e., tower levels) is the most interesting one. There's also the baron play, to secure an area, and the turn order auction which give you a lot to think about.

The board shows 5 areas, each with 3 regions, and the palace area with just one. There's also a deck of bonus cards (they give you the various elements in the game, e.g. coin, workers, build points, etc.) -- everyone starts with one?

Each round starts with an auction for turn order and cubes from supply (earlier turn get more cubes). Each position also has a unique power (e.g., buy cubes at lower cost, get free coin).

On your turn, may buy additional cubes. Place as many of your cubes as you want. May also place your baron (must be accompanied by 2 or 3 cubes depending on region), which prevents any further cubes from being added to that region.

At the end of each round, the player controlling the palace gets a coin and may move one cube to a different area. Then, 3 of the other 5 areas reward the player with the most cubes in them (spend a cube to buy an action card, steal a build point from someone, or buy up to 4 build points at a cost of 2 coins each). Next, all 15 areas reward the player controlling them with cubes, coins, and/or build points. Finally, players MUST, in turn order, spend build points to build their tower. Each tower level costs a number of build points = 1 + level (+1 if first player to build that level). 

After each round but the first, a random event triggers (it was revealed the previous round). These generally target one of the 5 board areas, resulting in cubes being removed unless the player pays for them some how.

The game ends after a set number of rounds (varies with player count). The player with the highest tower wins (tiebreakers: build points left, then ...).

RATING: N/A
Nice simple majority game. I've only played it with 3 players and I think it can improve with four players although it drags longer. The way turns occur make the game have some downtime and some uncontrolled feeling that may be even stronger if played with four players but it also has some advantages because it adds a fourth character into play and a more challenging demand for majority in each region making the price of each prestige point even more valuable, specially for the player who first builds.

The first builder rule is a very good rule because it's a simple mechanism that only works when players have some strategy experience with the game or with this kind of game. It gives players a good feeling of difficult choices but with very simple rules and a nice balance between luck (cards and events) and strategy (specially when changing turns players should be aware of the spaces they want to occupy in the following turn).

When I see games like this one with cards that tweak the game and introduce some chaos I often dislike them mainly because they give a sense of control that it's not real. In Jerusalem, with the unbreakable value of the baron character players always have the chance to protect themselves from a more aggressive play or even a random event.

After a much more simpler game like Lungarno, Michele Mura designed this very well "putted together" euro game with some chaos and randomness but with a tight and strong strategic feeling that I obviously like enough to play occasionally. Well done.

Having only read the rules this looks like another formulaic Euro without one stich of orginality. However, game play might be ok - just that i have 50 games that do what this game does already. Morevover the theme looked promising, but the game appears to have very little connection to the city or it's history - it could just as easily be set anywhere (Florence, Venice,,,,)

The catch up mechanics look a bit crude.

Area control game with a poorly pasted on theme. I found the game too dry but would play again and could probably enjoy it. The role selection part has a big influence on the game, and since the roles are auctioned, a good feel or knowledge of the power of the roles and play order is very important. Rating after one play.

A very solid game with some good player interaction and nice mechanics. The theme is not very inspiring and is fairly thin which probably puts many people off this game but it is a satisfying strategy cube pusher that is easy enough to teach and play in about 90 minutes.

With no time to lose I jumped into the first game with an opening that I spotted, which happened to be Valerie doing a rules read of a new game that I’d actually never heard of: Jerusalem. I usually try to avoid learning a game through a rules read at the table, but fortunately Jerusalem was simple and familiar enough for everyone pick it up very quickly. It’s basically El Grande lite, with a bit of Kreta in there (i.e., the Abbot unit, which is a Bishop in Jerusalem), and a few other area majority mechanics mixed into the blender. Of course it even has the Province/Court distinction as discussed earlier in reference to El Grande, Louis XIV, Hansa Teutonica, and Founding Fathers. Jerusalem was fine, but far from Earth shattering, and reminded me of Wallace’s Toledo in that respect, meaning that it worked but there was absolutely nothing to set it apart from the masses. I also did not appreciate that the game inevitably ended with all of the players just about tied and I managed to squeak out a victory for no particular reason. Like Power Grid (upon which I’ve expounded here and also here), the players are bound to end up tied more often than not with a tie breaker deciding the result, which is fine if it happens occasionally, but unsatisfying when it’s the norm. Jerusalem was a game of putting cubes into regions to win pluralities so that you could earn more cubes, victory points, or money which was used shockingly to buy more cubes (and to be fair money was also used in an auction for turn order, which included special abilities on the turn order cards). I like plenty of area majority games, particularly El Grande, San Marco, Kreta, and Louis XIV, but at this point a game really needs to stand out to get a foothold in the genre, and Jerusalem did a wonderful job of blending in.

The goal for each player is to control the key Sectors of the city: the King, the Church, the Market, the Military, the Nobilty and the Tower of David. This control is achieved gaining the favors of the most important roles of the city (such as the Constable) and by placing Men and Barons into these Sectors. Who owns the most forces gets the Revenue of that area: Men, Gold and Tower-Points. The players can use these new resources to improve their position in the city. At the end of each round the players can rise their Towers building new floors. Also players will have to manage the Special Privileges and bad Events that will take place at end of each Round.
At the end of the game, the player with the highest Tower will be the winner and his family will rule the city!

A perfectly solid, if uninspired, majority game.  It is heavily influenced by El Grande, and I think that it really doesn't do anything in terms of gameplay or experience that El Grande doesn't do better.

I'd play it again, but I'd rather play El Grande.

By the way, the scoring tower is essentially the same scoring mechanism used in The Gates of Loyang, but more cleverly disguised.  I wonder if it will get the same negative buzz as the scoring in that game.

i unfortunately heard not very favourable comments about this game but i am happy to say those voices were wrong!
Let's start with what i didn't like about it: it does seem a bit cold and the theme seems really pasted on. Jerusalem could be any other city in the world or whatever.

That said, the mechanics even if not very original are good and solid and part of them are very interesting. in a 3 players game you have this very very interesting decision of which role-card try to acquire: the first one seems to get so many advantes but the last one can calmly place men in the best places. Our game was very very tense and balanced and i liked it very much.
Rules are easy enough and a game has a reasonable length therefore i think this is a very godo game and easily my favourite by Michele Mura. Good job Michele!

Pasted on theme : i never felt any connection to the theme
Boring gameplay : it's very much counting cubes and calculating outcomes
No catch up mechanism : winner takes it all and hard to come back when you are outbet in the first round on the extra meeple section 
Analysis paralysis is huge between turns : the calculating leads to this 

Tip : play El Grande instead of this.

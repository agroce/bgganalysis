Super Hero version of Munchkin. Suffers from the same problems as standard Munchkin.

All the munchkin games go down very well with my grandson.  If anything Super munchkin gets fewer plays than Cthulhu and Bites, so I guess that says a bit.

The backstories, sidekicks etc are a fun addition to the game. 
Sadly we never seem to play it as much, I think this might be because there is not nice board.

Mashing expansions together is also fun only done it with this and Munchkin but it seemed to work well.

I love superheroes and comic books so this was an easy decision to pick up for me.  The potentional for massively powerful Munchkins exists more so in this game than in any other Munchkin theme.  At least that's been my experience.

RATING: 2
Great theme, horrible execution. Could be fun if I didn't care about mechanics, but I do and so I don't like it. P.S.- There are fun, light games which also have good mechanics, so I don't think it's forgiveable just because it's a "get drunk and have fun with your buds, it's not serious!" kind of game. BOY can it drag on too. Played this one with my nieces who aren't even teens yet and they understood it enough but were very happy when it was over.

If you like Munchkin, chances are you'll like Super Munchkin.  Some of the humor is a little more 'adult oriented' than the other munchkin games I've played.  Consequently, you may want to filter out some cards before playing with children.

Traded Away

Maybe I don't have the right crowd of people to enjoy Munchkin but it just isn't there for me. I got this in a trade for a rather expensive Kickstarter backed game and was disappointed with the results.

Munchkin looks a lot more than than it was to play. 2-player variants aren't really fun at all either.

RATING: 3
Haven't played any of the Munchkin games before, so don't have a point of reference, but maybe that's a good thing here.  The rules don't seem to cover everything, but again maybe that is the point with this game.  Hadn't played this one in awhile and made the mistake of reintroducing the game while playing with two 11 year-olds each of whom possess a much better memory of how to play the game than I.  Annoying experience.  This game needs much better rules.  My son loves it, though.  Otherwise this one would be on the trading block in a heartbeat.

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) I used to be enamoured of the Munchkin series, which was partially responsible for bringing me to BGG, but it is certainly a game where familiarity can breed contempt. The humour is great, the artwork is perfect, and the concept of reducing the role-playing experience to its shallowest component elements is fun. The fatal flaw is the directionless randomness and the tortuously prolonged time it takes to finish a game.

[b]5 year verdict:[/b] Munchkin was one of the first non-traditional games I bought, and I played a lot of it early on, but I have definitely moved on. I'm only keeping this copy for sentiment's sake.

Fun superhero card game. The best part of this is definitely funny descriptions and clever superhero powers, some of which really made me ROTFL. I like the sidekick concept too.

This isn't really a game.  I mean, it's something to do while hanging out with friends, but I don't really feel like there's a lot of complexity here.  I don't feel like I matter when I play it, I'm just going through the motions.  This allows me to interact with my friends more, and make fun of what's going on, but I could do that without this particular distraction just as easily. I do like the theme though.  I have a soft spot super heroes.

All Munchkin games boil down to Draw a card > roll the number on the card to win > negotiate with a friend if you're unlikely to roll that number

(Ella's)

- Very funny, but only if someone familiar with the theme
- Hard to learn, too complex for too many people (even if played before)
- Hard to keep track on players' abilities
- Takes time to understand a card, as the flavor is mixed with the abilities of the card. Make the game long.
- Not much to do on other players' turns
- Very luck based (some good/bad cards heavily change your game)
- Fun to play
- Require adjusting strategies, as abilities gained/lost quickly

RATING: 8
Probably my favorite version of Munchkin, which is no surprise because I enjoy Munchkin as well as comic book superheroes. This version of Munchkin brings in Powers, Origins, and a play balance skewed in favor of the player. Powers are great, as they are in other versions of Munchkin, and Origins just make Powers even better - sometimes broken. As for the balance, this was done to make the players more like the common superhero. The villains really don't stand a chance against you, so it's up to the other players to represent the world and question if your being so powerful is appropriate. The game is pretty ridiculous, but it's ridiculous in a good way.

Another Munchkin version, I liked the hero theme but it is not like a big deal. I bought first Munchkin legends so it just feels like I bought another copy of Legends. It is OK if you don't have any version. The powers and ranks may be a bit confusing at the beginning if you are not familiar with the game.
In my opinion, I prefer Munchkin Marvel instead of Super Munchkin, at least it feels better to equip Iron-Man's armor or the Mjolnir instead a punned weapon.

----------------------------

Otra versión de Munchkin, me gustó por la temática de superhéroes pero no es la gran cosa. Primero había comprado Munchkin legends y al comprar este sentí que había comprado otra copia del Legends. Está bien si no tienes ninguna versión de Munchkin. Los poderes y rangos pueden ser un poco enredosos al inicio si no se está familiarizado con el juego.
En mi opinión, prefiero Munchkin Marvel que Super Munchkin, se siente mejor equipar a tu personaje con la armadura de Iron-Man o el Mjolnir que con algún arma de juego de palabras.

In general, I think this is a little better than regular Munchkin, mainly because it's a little more accessible for non-gamers.  Most pop-culture aware people can appreciate the superhero theme better than the dungeon-crawl theme.  Still silly fun that can get old pretty quick, but does well if you don't expect too much from it.

I don't enjoy this edition of Munchkin as much as some of the others. It doesn't feel as engrossing as the original, or even Star Munchkin, and it's not quite as funny. Still, if you enjoy the other Munchkin games, and like Super Heroes, you can't really go wrong with this one. Just don't expect it to be any better than the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game tries to add some new stuff, but isn't as good as the original Munchkin.
If you want a Munchkin game, get the original! If you already have it and want to have a new theme, get the Star Munchkin which, in my opinion, is better that the Super Munchkin.

This Munchkin variant suffers from the same weakness as the others; it takes much too long for what should be a 30 minute (or less) filler game.  I do like how the cards allow for building a story around your character (origin, sidekick, headquarters, powers, class, etc.).  This is something that is less apparent in the base Munchkin game.  However, the game still stretches too long.

Always a favorite between my friends and myself.  Munchkin is a great card game that's not overly collectable like a TCG, but updates itself often enough to stay fresh.

TRY Dec/08.  Was more complicated than many other Munchkins (powers, origins, sidekicks, classes, etc.), so was not necessarily the best choice for my nephew (age 8).

I like this game, but I find Munchkin, in no matter what skin to be very repetitive. I also prefer it with a very competitive group of players. Sadly I find people get impatient with turns. Speeding the game up on purpose would help ease this pain. A friend owns most all of the expansions and while I enjoy Munchkin, it ins't at the top of my list.

RATING: 2
I don't care if this game is meant to be a satirical love letter to uber-serious role-playing systems(or in this edition's case, comic book tropes) that winks at you incessantly like someone eating sour candy  and that it shouldn't be taken too seriously . It's still terrible. The rules are muddled and sometimes directionless (there are too many actions that you're able to take at any time for no apparent reason or advantage - "play cards WHENEVER YOU WANT!"). There is a disconnect at a fundamental level in this game that ruins the experience for me. I think this lies primarily in the utter lack of active agency on the part of the player. Munchkin plays itself - if you find a foe, you compare numbers and either win or lose. If you collect a beneficial item, you equip it. Nothing requires any strategic consideration. So why should I engage at all with the "hilarious" "theme"? It has no referent in the mechanisms, which themselves are lazy and near-absent. I get that the main mechanism driving the game is whether or not to help others and when to betray them, but nothing else enhances those decisions, and they aren't that interesting to make, anyway.

What's more, the end game is infuriating, as everyone wisely gangs up on the person closest to 10. This prolongs the game horribly as everyone clambers to the top, only to get knocked back to zero. "First to x" games work only if others are able, by playing well and shifting allegiances, to slow the leader down. Munchkin instead resets (more often than not) the potential winner, creating this potentially infinite loop of monotony. A friend explained that the real strategy is to wait until everyone has exhausted their attack cards before swooping in and taking the win. Really? Sounds like I'm combating lazy game design, not my opponents.

Another beer and pretzels style bash the leader romp. This time, players have sooper heroes that they build up in order to battle monsters. Sure, the cards are funny spoofs of the genre but players have little control over what they can do. Each turn, you flip a card and pray that it's good for you. Thre's never any monsters when you want to battle one! Think the deck distribution needs work. Maybe a variant where there's a monster deck that players flip once they decide to battle?

Meh.

Nagyon hasonló az alap Munchkinhoz. Annyi eltérés van, hogy vannak úgynevezett erő lapok, amiknek van egy szintje. Az össz szintjük max. annyi lehet, amennyi a mi szintünk. Nagyon sok lap egy az egyben ugyanaz, mint az alap verzióban, így én nem látom sok értelmét, hogy valaki ezt megszerezze a mellé. Viszont ahelyett már jó választás lehet. Továbbra sem az én játékom.

This is one crazy Munchkin game, I worked out it is possible to get your powers up to strength 94 I think it was, kind of ridiculous, I mean of course you would win before that happens, but the potential to get that strong just from the right powers is a bit crazy. I managed to get my strength to around 45 total and that was a bit ridiculous too. But it's munchkin and it's fun being powerful

Silly fun.  Some people I've played with just can't stand the amount of chaotic rulebreakers and take that gameplay.  My suggestion is to just enjoy the theme and humor while it lasts.

I'm so tired of Munchkin that even a theme that I'm interested in doesn't do it for me. Munchkin is not a bad game just not a great one either and well gets old after you've read the cards once or twice.

I think this is my favourite of the series I have played so far. Though I sometimes feel like there isn't nearly enough villains/monsters in the set. we've had more than a few turns where no monsters are drawn so everyone is piling on the powers, but can't go up levels because there are no monsters to beat!

Like any version of Munchkin, this is basically a comedy delivery system. Also like the other versions, it overstays its welcome. In fact, if anything, it seems to drag on even worse as everyone conspires to frustrate the frontrunner.

I used to like Munchkin but not anymore. The game is just awfully boring and the card text is loaded and not very clear at times. The game is not for everyone, probably more for geeky fan boys.

This version allows the players to build up their combat strength to ungodly levels, makes stomping on the villians a little easy but very fun.

Munchkin vacillates between a 4 and 6 for me.  If it hasn't been played in a while, busting it out can be quite  fun - repeated plays can get dull very quick.

level 9 means "one step from winning.".  You play until 80% of the players have reached level 9, then spin the bottle to pick the final winner.

Not cool, at least in my book.  To top it off, the game may suck away 4 hours of your time too. :(

A funny version, but like Munchkin Fu, the power level of the players increases too fast. Not enough cards in the deck to mess the other players up with. This game could use a new expansion that adds a bunch more difficult monsters, more monster enhancers, traps, etc.

Hooray! Another munchkin game. Different cards, same story. Fun the first couple of times through all the jokes, then awful. Play someone else's or better yet, just read through the cards. (Then again, maybe you shouldn't bother. I rated this a point lower than regular Munchkin because the jokes in Super Munchkin actually aren't all that funny.)

For some reason, this and later Munchkin base sets just weren't as captivating and fun as the original game, Star Munchkin and Munchkin-Fu. Parody and general absurdity abound and it is fun to play in its own right...but for some reason just not as much fun as the earlier games.

This game can be fun. This game can be droll. Basically, you need to be really, really drunk to get a kick out of it. Monsters come up rarely, it seemed, and there weren't enough f#&$ you cards to really stick it to your friends. I recommend this game as a light filler. (That was particularly negative. Honestly, the game's ok for younger players, and plays light at best. I would recommend sticking a couple of munchkin sets together and creating your own mix of screw cards, buffs, and monsters.)

Same old Munchkin fun, but I think it tries to do a little too much and can get kind of bogged down.  Do love the sidekicks, though!

Only played so far with the Epic Blender Tournament at Origins. Not by itself..yet. 
I definitely like the Power level feature and all the superhero spoofs you can think of. ex: "Sprayed on costume" & "Cleavage Stun" get an extra +2 combined.

It's munchkin.. Silly and fun with cool artwork, but the end of the game always ends the same... The first person who's about to win gets HAMMERED by all other players and once everyone is out of defensive cards, someone wins.

Numerous versions of Munchkin are owned in my circle of friends, and since I collect comic books, I decided to get Super Munchkin.  Whatever the theme, it is nice, lighthearted fun, that builds inevitably into frenetic rounds of kill the leader.

Munchkin but with another theme. Not as interesting as the original.

My cut and paste comments on these games are basically equivalent to the cut and paste game play they offer.

It was a bit confusing at start.. until the end. The original Munchkin looks more exciting when I saw it in Tabletop.

RATING: 6
Very light and high variance. Apparently you could think of it as an expansion or an upgrade to En Garde, though I never played En Garde, personally. I might find it a little boring without the characters, or if the games didn't go by so quickly. 

The rules are super-simple. The games are fast, though not quite as fast as Sirlin makes it out to be, at least for new players. An individual round takes less than 5 minutes, but a full game could take as much as 15, or maybe 20 if you're both slow.

It can be a very strategic game, but only if you take the time to examine your hand and discard and think carefully about your moves. However, once you have a more intuitive feel for it, it feels a good bit like the first few seconds of a video game fighting game, where you're both trying to get that "First Hit!" bonus.

I have the portable version, which is excellent for the price ($17). The cards that make up the bridge tend to slide on a smooth surface, so put down some cloth (a shirt, table cloth, playmat, whatever) before you play.

Art and iconography are lovely.

Here, let's design a Sirlin game together:

1. Take an existing game that is already quite successful.
2. Add a heavy dose of randomness.
3. Add gratuitous "special powers".
4. Write a designer diary about how your game "fixes" the existing game.
5. Serve hot.

Bottom line on this one, skip it.

RATING: 1
I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.
http://www.projectafterforums.com/index.php?showtopic=1363

I'm not telling anyone to not buy his games, but given that he is pretty much a one man operation, please keep in mind that you're truly voting with your dollars in this case.

His games entirely derivative anyway.

I had high expectations for it when I purchased it, and after getting it to the table, it did not disappoint.

Fast, furious, and fun--so good that alliteration is required to describe it.

There is simple gameplay with the moving and attacking business, and that in and of itself is pretty enjoyable.  However, once the individual player powers are added, the game absolutely explodes with awesomeness.

Beautiful art.  Simple mechanics.  Great overall gaming experience.

RATING: 5.5
Games are extremely quick, and the abilities really give each character a distinct playing style. Components are of mixed quality, however: I got an early printing of the deluxe edition and the insert was flimsy, the cover was scuffed and almost all of the cards had frayed edges. The win tokens and pawns were nice, and though the board was warped it was replaced promptly. All in all the portable version may be a better value.

RATING: 7
Players are Fantasy Strike characters battling it out in a fencing/fighting competition.  Players play cards from their hand to move up and down an 18 space fencing track.  The cards come from a 25 card deck (1-5, five times) and are played from a hand of five.  Cards can move, push, attack or dashing strike (move/attack).  Attacks can be blocked,  and strikes can either be blocked or retreated from (forfeiting your next turn).  An attack or strike that gets through earns a point, and first to five points wins.  This is 95% Knizia's En Garde, with only a couple of mechanical changes, and a brilliant addition of the Fantasy Strike character powers, which gives the game marvellous re-playability.  Superb little filler.

RATING: 7
after the initial play with my partner, I thought it was alright, but she didn't find enough depth in it for her, and will likely be reluctant to try it again.  It's quick and easy to teach though, so I introduced it to another friend of mine.  How fun the game is seems to depend on which characters are facing off, and how well the player utilizes the character's special abilities.  For now I'll rate it a 7, but there is potential for the rating to go up if I get a chance to play it more against the same opponent.

Great!  Knizia's En Garde is now obsolete.  A great little filler that has asymmetric characters, so your strategy has to be a little different depending on your opponent.  For a light game it has a surprising amount of strategy and has that "just-one-more" quality about it.

This is a very good game. It is a bit limited, but that's the nature of the game; it's fast and focused. The only real complaint I have is that the art is so nice, but then there's only one piece per character! Perhaps future editions will have more varied art.

RATING: 9
Flash Duel is inferior to Yomi (one of its sister-games) in depth and subtlety of design, but this game is still excellent and deserves to be played.  Having a best-of-5 match take only 20 minutes doesn't hurt either.

Above all, Flash Duel is a masterstroke of "flavor."  Each of the 10 characters has a completely distinct style of play, and every style has its own philosophy behind it.  If you want to be the acrobat, the meat tank, or even the pacifist, there's a character for you.  And there is depth enough in the simple ruleset to keep you coming back for more.

Fun game, quick to set up and quick to play. Simple ruleset, and different characters provide variety. Exposed discard eliminates need to card-count, but looking ahead a turn or two is still rewarded (your hand is replenished each turn, so there's a good degree of randomization as well).

Haven't played enough to judge replayability. The non-deluxe Flash Duel is nice and compact, which I prefer (fans of large fancy boxes can hop for the deluxe edition). Art is quite nice, also.

Reiner Knizia's En Garde with some special event cards. One play only, but the event cards seemed fuzzily worded and open to (mis)interpretation, and seemd to detract rather than add to the gameplay.

To be fair my opponent noted that this was the first time he'd experienced the effects hindering rather than adding to the gameplay (it was his game), but it left me thinking that the basic En Garde game was the superior game and didn't need the clutter. 

As an aside, I feel much the same way about Knizia's Schotten Totten, which I think is worse for the additional of the special cards in the Battle Line/ later Schotten Totten editions of the game. The man knows his own work best, I feel.

RATING: 8
Probably the "weakest" Sirlin Game, but certainly no slouch! Flash Duel is a test of evaluating your odds and shuffling in and out of your opponent's effective ranges. There are also 10 unique characters (seeing a pattern here?) with their own special abilities. This game is mostly balanced, though certain characters (DeGrey, Midori, Setsuki) are clearly better than others (Argagarg, Lum) This game is quick, fun, and most importantly (IMO) portable (It can fit in your pocket!), so you can take this game and enjoy it wherever, whenever, and in a timely fashion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun take on En Garde by David Sirlin.  I enjoyed En Garde, but after a few plays it became a bit dry.  Flash Duel remedies that issue to some degree by introducing 10 different character, each with 3 abilities that can influence the game.
    Flash Duel still plays about as quickly as En Garde did, and my girlfriend and I can get through a flurry of games in one sitting.  She thinks Argagarg Garg, the Water Shaman, is cute.

I finally got to play this reworking of Reiner Knizia's original Duell/En Garde and I have to admit that the special abilities of the fighting game inspired characters in Flash Duel added interest and variety.  I rate the original games an 8 and this reworked version an 8.5.  
*edit* Rating reduced to 7, since I have very little desire to play this game, especially since Sirlin keeps changing it.

Really like this quick and easy game. Infinitely replayable with more depth than I had anticipated.  I like this better than En Garde which this game is highly influenced by (Even mentioned by the designer in the rules as such). 

Great fun pitting the different characters against each other and exploring the multitudes of strategies that emerge.  Everyone who has played it has enjoyed it. Rating has gone up to 9...it's a game I can pull out and play anytime with anyone. Well Done!

I highly recommend the Deluxe version if you can afford it...the box, gameboard and chips really add a satisfying tactile aspect to the game.

RATING: 8
I have to give it to Knizia, En Garde is a fascinating card duel. It's tense enough in its simplicity, does it necessary to mess it up with random characters with contrived abilities? No, not really. But definitely worth to try with the carefully balanced, yet colorful guest stars from Yomi, and you will never go back to plain En Garde. Feels like a natural extension of the base mechanic, and boosts the replayability easily by a few hundred plays.

En Garde with character abilities; ultimately, the changes Sirlin has made to En Garde make the game more tactical and less strategic.  Given the choice, I'd play En Garde (with advanced rules) in preference every time.

RATING: 6
Interesting variant of En Garde. The characters and their abilities do add to the game, giving it more replay value. After a quick session with a single round using each character, the balances seem ok, as long as you remember to watch for your opponent's abilities.

Indifferent.

This is a very enjoyable game, as those familiar with Sirlin's work will not be surprised to learn. It can be played quickly once you're familiar with the rules, but has a surprising amount of strategic depth due to the large number of potential match ups. I heartily recommend it for both fighting game fans and strategy card game fans, as well as anyone in the market for a fun two player game.

RATING: 3.75
A very simple game, inspired by Knizia's "En Garde" (it actually says that in the rulebook). A 2 player duel game with two characters moving across a bidirectonial board, attacking, pushing and dashing towards each other. Whoever hits wins the round (Best of 3). The game is very simple, cards are number 1 to 5 with 5 cards of each in the deck. Players use those cards to move spaces or attack (with the number being the distance). You can either block or retreat with the right cards, but if cannot do either, you lost. There are 10 characters in the game which have clearly been inspired by old-school beat-em up's (think Street Figher etc.) which makes sense as a theme considering the game depicts the "duel" between two characters. The characters come with three special abilities which add a bit more strategy although I found that they come into play rarely. All in all, a good filler game but there are tons of games out there I'd rather buy, better 2-player games or games with more visual appeal. HX

I would like to think that this is a better game, especially since Mykel is so excited about it, but I just don't find it to be all that fun. At its core, this is a bluffing and hand management game, but one that seems to be over too quickly. Rather than finding it elegant, it seems that it is more of a crapshoot, and I haven't been able to figure out what little strategy does seem possible.

This game was very fun for it's simplicity.  The trick is to learn how to play to each characters abilities.  If one person has this figured out, but their opponent doesn't, that player will almost always win.  If both players have their characters figured out, it should be an interesting match.  There may be some balance issues between characters.  But, everyone has a chance against each other.  I really enjoyed this game.

Quite simple and fun two-player game. Players take roles of fantasy characters aiming to kill each other. One hit is enough, but luckily you can parry or dodge. Players move and make hits by playing cards from their hand. Each character has also three different special abilities, which can be played on certain situations. If the deck runs out, then the character wins, who is closer to the opposite end. Repeat until one player has three victories.

RATING: 6
One can feel the time and effort that went into balancing this game, as you can with most Sirlin games.  It has a fine balance of offense and defense, allowing players an equal chance of winning from going on an attack, or just holding back and hoping for a last-minute win.  The game could be pretty satisfying just from the basic rules, but the character cards add some nice variety to keep the game interesting and challenging.  It may not hold up well to other games of its ilk (and with Yomi out, there's some competition in the "Two-player games that play quickly, look simple, but have more depth than you would expect" category), but I can see it being nice enough for the occasional play.

This game made me remember board games can be a lot of fun.
The game is extremely easy to setup, learn and teach.
Still it has a lot of gameplay, replayability.
It´s not the deepest game you can find and Im sure with a few hundred of hours you will find the game more monotonous.
But is clear that´s not the role the game wants to fill.
It´s an extremly fast game to fit in small periods of time even against people that never played it before, and for that role the game is outstanding.

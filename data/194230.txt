GAME: Attack on Titan: Deck-Building Game
RANK: 2882

RATING: 9
Started watching the anime a few days ago, the game really lives up to the theme (although my first game was with 2 people who had never seen the show before - and they enjoyed the game)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Another great evolution on this deck-building system, there's a spatial element with the wall cards and tokens and a lot of tension as they start to fall and affect the market for more cards. Good fit for the theme of the manga and anime, and if you've played any of the Cerberus games before it's pretty easy to pick up. This one is purely co-op, like Crisis Mode in the DC version, but there are VP totals on the Titans so that you can use them in the other games!

RATING: 8
It's great to have an AoT game that employs the well-known Cerberus system, though be aware that this isn't Cerberus proper like the Lord of the Rings and DC deck-builders. It adds a good bit more complication to the setup and the play system, which can seem out of place for those familiar with the other games. That being said, it provides a good AoT experience, complete with nigh-unto insurmountable odds and fantastic artwork from the anime. Overall, I'm glad to have the game in my collection, but I won't be reaching for it as often as the simpler versions.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: I have limited knowledge of the IP that this deckbuilding game is based on but from what I experienced in my first plays, the game evokes the theme fairly well. Based on my limited experience, this game is particularly brutal if the team does not coordinate immediately to take down arch-titans. The game uses a spacial element that I found interesting, with thrust being used to move your character to different battlefields in order to interact. Power is the main resource and can be used to buy cards as well as defeat titans. Our first few plays resulted in dismal failure as we came to grips with balancing the need to acquire gear/allies and defending our walls from the titan threat. I'd love to experience more plays in order to see if the game balances well with different numbers of players.

This was a decent deck builder. Not a favorite, but not bad either. Will play again, though not sure if my score will improve. Played on the easiest mode, and it seemed like the higher difficulties might be too difficult. Nice quality components though, interesting play style. Worked well with the theme of the game, and incorporating the show.

For fans of Attack on Titan.  I'm not big on most DC Deck builder games but this one has Power and Move which helps.  The problem is this game is brutally hard even ignoring some of the most challenging mechanics and it can be hard to find people to play with.

A very thematic deck builder with an added element of having to move to where you are needed. This game feels very true to the theme, is just the right amount of difficult and feels truly perilous when a titan is bashing down the wall. We found this a truly absorbing play through and found the cooperative factor very strong as we were constantly working together. After a few more plays I have put up to 9 because I continue to love it.

Brutally difficult, about 25% win rate, but when you win its epic.  Love the game, art and style match the Anime and Manga very well.  I feel that this is the best representation of Attack on Titan in board game form.

RATING: 2
A needlessly hard game that does a disservice to the Cerberus engine. The annoying combination of weak cards costing 5 power or less to buy with arch titans that require so much power to defeat completely ruined the game for me.  Even if you can get the power necessary to deal the final blow, a secondary random card draw can mean that your 7-10 power turn that happens maybe twice per game was wasted. Losing this game came as a sweet relief. On the plus side the art was good for fans of the theme. Also we were at the mercy of an alpha player so I don't know how much my comments reflect the rules so your mileage may vary.

RATING: 7.5
A very thematic cooperative deck-building game. Looks to be quite difficult to beat on the first plays, which is a good thing because it invites replays.

I don't know how the replayability will be as you go through the same deck each game, but for now it is a very exciting game. Love the art and theme, but the cards look like they might show wear pretty soon.

The first of Cryptozoic's Cerberus deck builders to be designed as a co-op from the ground up. A good co-op, perhaps a little too long.

The new mechanics with the wall are interesting and work well both thematically and as an addition to the game system.

Substantially alters the basic Cryptozoic deck-building format to provide a serviceable AoT experience and a challenging cooperative game.  It doesn't get as much play as it could mostly because single games can be very long, gruelling, and end abruptly with player elimination.

RATING: 7
Art is good and matches the tv series art style. Components are overall pretty good. Cards are a tad bit flimsy and when I removed them from the box some of them were stuck together and required a bit of work to separate. 

The tokens are a really nice thick glossy cardboard but the HP tokens for the arch enemy titans are horrendous. They're so small that they can be hard to grab and easy to lose.

The gameplay is pretty interesting as you can manipulate where titans will show up by clearing out cards in that district. The movement is interesting and keeping enough movement to make sure you can get around is important. Positioning in the game is important as well as there are certain cards that bestow effects to everyone in a district or a couple of people in the same district as you so coordinating is really important.

One play so far but really enjoyed the standard deck building mechanics with some nice additions. I like the positional play and the focus of having a wall to protect. I like the variety of where titans will appear. Finally I love the fact it's pure co-op! Often these games have a secondary win mechanism but in AoT you either beat the titans and survive or.........

[Played 1 time]

Dominion variant with cards randomly on offer (so totally tactical, rather than strategical).
Randomness helps replayability and can sometimes play a significant role.
Light and not especially tense (or hard), it's some mindless fun.
I have no knowledge of the setting, so it did nothing for me (not a big deal).

Just throwing a comment in here to clear some things up mentioned in other comments.

1. 12 out of 80 cards have a cost of 6 or higher. Not 3/4.
2. When you die, you retain your deck. You do not get a new starter deck. You just get a new Character.
3. This game requires cooperation. Lots and lots of cooperation.

I want to try this again.
It has a very different feel from other Cerebrus system games, which it probably should. 
I'm not sure why the play felt flat.
There was tension.
I super lost.
I would like to try non-solo.

Attack on Titan gehört wohl zu den bekanntesten und besten Animes der letzten Jahre. Das düstere Setting, äußerst brutale Szenen und die absolute Hilflosigkeit der Protagonisten, gehören zu einigen der Merkmale der Serie. Diese Atmosphäre wurde mehr als gelungen in das Deck-Building Game zu Attack on Titan transportiert. Die Spieler agieren zusammen, gegen die Bedrohung der Titanen und bauen sich ihr Deck aus hilfreichen Karten zusammen. Dabei ist Attack on Titan nicht so statisch, wie andere Vertreter. Die Spieler müssen sich nämlich auch über die einzelnen Karten, bewegen und ihre Züge geschickt planen. Eine Apsprache untereinander und genaues, taktisches Vorgehen ist Pflicht, denn das Spiel ist sauschwer und verzeiht keine Fehler. Wenn ein "Archenemy" Titan auftaucht, erleidet man zuerst ebenso eine Schockstarre, wie die Charaktere im Anime. Meine einzige Kritik gilt dem Spielmaterial. Die Wundenmarken sind lächerlich klein, es gibt nicht genügend Standfüße für alle Heldencharaktere und die Karten hätten ruhig etwas dicker sein können. Dann wäre insgesamt auch eine "9" drin gewesen :-) Trotzdem: Fans der Vorlage kommen hier nicht drumherum!

Feels very different from the other Cerberus Engine games from Cryptozoic, but the basic engine is still the same. There are some unfortunate parallels to the Crisis Mode for the DC Deck Builder, such as being a fairly long game where luck can play a big role. At the same time, this feels like a noticeable refinement on that system. You are simply trying to defeat enemies as they show up before they can destroy the walls that protect the city. The game is good, though I'm sure I'd enjoy it more if I was familiar with the source material. I'll probably hang onto this, since I end up keeping most of these games anyway, but this isn't one of the better games with this system. I still like it, but it's probably my least favorite Cerberus Engine game of the ones I like.

UPDATE: Nah, it's better than Two Towers.

Very good Co-Op deck builder game. Solid even if you don't know the IP, much better if you do. It is really hard to finish the game and its not short. Has some replayability but its not as long lasting as Dominion or Clank! in Space or Hero Realms.

If you are a fan of the series, you like deck building games and a good challange this one is for you. Don't Wworry about spoilers if you haven finished the series it has none.

RATING: 5
The starter decks seem fundsmentally flawed, filled with unnecessary movement points and not enough to power points to buy upgrades (other than the cruddy 3D gear) since 3/4 of the deck costs 6 power or more. It's hard enough to defeat the first Titan if the deck isn't 100% lin your favor. Too much luck. Too much artificial difficulty.Might as well have player elimination, because coming back into the game with a new character using the starter deck is just as useless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really well built deck builder. The way you can move from area to area brings a good strategy to the game. We haven't won a 4 or 5 player game, but just won our first 3 player game. Since more cards come out with more people, I think it raises the difficulty with more people. It is well balanced with the ability to buy equipment in between titan attacks.

I've never seen the show (bought it as a gift for some friends), but I love hard co-ops and this one hard and intense co-op. I really enjoyed playing it and would definitely play it again.

My only real complaint is that the rule book could have been better. It really needed more picture examples and it explains some concepts oddly. Thankfully the game is not that hard to comprehend.

Standard fare game when it comes to deck builders, but I love the anime series and so the theme really comes out for me. Very, very difficult to win & success really depends on which cards come out for purchase and the frequency of titan attacks, both of which are for the most part random (although there are a few cards that allow you to peek/re-arrange). If it wasn't for the setting, I'd probably rate this at a 6.

*Update June 2017*
Dropping rating down to a 6 & putting it on the trade pile -- success is dependent on too many random factors which are out of your control. There is little to no luck mitigation available, and whether or not you have any is...you guess it...determined by a random factor.

Teamwork is critical, but in order to be truly effective you need to figure out precisely how your team functions together.

Hard game, maybe a bit too long, but I love every minute of it. My wife and I can't stop playing this. The damage counters are poor and dice work much better. I use six 10-sided dice. They do only give you Plastic Stands for 5 of the characters, so I recommend buying more. I bought mine from http://spielpro.com/plastic-card-stand-rectangle-19mm-x-17mm/ and color coded them as best as I could to the characters. One thing to be weary of, is if you are going to do a short game version, where you take out around 20 cards, you might lose a lot of good cards that would help the heros, making the game even harder. Would be nice to have a curated list of the cards to take out for a shorter game. I'm addicted to this game though. Hits just the right spot for me.

Better than I would've expected from a licenses Cryptozic title.  Still has issues - overly complex, some really weak card effects, overly variable & punishing effects of wounds with too little ability to deal with them, etc.  But the core game is a decent thematic fit and offers some interesting decisions.

[i]Rulebook and component impressions:[/i]

Oy vey. The instructions/diagrams for building the draw deck are awkward and confusing. And what Cryptozoic grammar magician decided that "outside" and "outward" should mean completely different things? If there was ever a question as to whether professional writers, editors and graphic artists should exist, look no further for the definitive answer.  They should.

Plus why are the "1" damage counters microscopically tiny? One fell into a pore on my index finger and got swept up in my epidermal osmosis chain.  Good luck getting that out with tweezers.

[i]Background:[/i]

My Cerberus deck-building library consists of the four DC Comics games (+ all expansions), the Hobbit, and the Lord of the Rings. They're solid games for families, people new to deck-building, and people looking for a lighter experience. A big plus is that they only take a few minutes to set up.

However, a significant problem with the competitive games in the Cerberus line is that - because there is only a single currency (Power) - these games have the worst "runaway leader" problem that I've ever seen. If you score an early 'high power' card and defeat a villain, that defeated villain goes into your deck, which makes you stronger, which allows you to defeat more villains, etc.

The co-op games (DC Crisis expansions, Titan) avoid this problem because "purchased" villains are removed from the game and nobody cares if someone's deck gets insanely powerful, since everyone is on the same team. This elevates the Cerberus co-op games above the competitive ones. 

[i]Unique Mechanics in Attack on Titans:[/i]

There are five different areas (walls), and each wall has an inside (where the cards are) and an outside (where the titans are).  Card-based movement points allow you to bounce between and across walls, and cards can only be purchased when you physically occupy their location.  There are also two new ways to lose: (1) when all walls have been destroyed by titan attacks and (2) too much player death.  Players gain wounds when they soak up damage from a titan assault, and playing two wounds at once will kill you, as will gaining an additional wound when you already have one in play.

[i]Final Comments:[/i]

I had serious doubts as to whether Titan would be different enough from DC and LotR to be worth a purchase. As a surprise even to me, I'd say yes - it is.  Attacks on Archenemy Titans are similar to Confrontations/Blocks in DC Rivals, but this seems more like a friendly adaptation than a rip-off.  The package works, and my family was impressed, even having played a dozen other Cerberus games.  That makes $27 online well spent.

Warnings: The game isn't short.  With all the discussion, plus the fact that you have to plow through almost the entire deck to win, the game can last a full two hours.  Also, 3 players is best.  Any more and players are so busy fighting titans that it's difficult to build up your deck power. Then there's the fact, that, with all timed deck-building games, more players = fewer turns per player = weaker decks.  I definitely wouldn't play with five without a player-boosting variant.  E.g., four cards come out per round instead of five, each player starts with a 3D Gear card in their deck, etc.

A very fun and unforgivable game. The AoT theme of the anime is perfectly captured in this game. Defeating the Archenemy Titans is quite a challenge and rightly so.

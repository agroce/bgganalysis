RATING: 6
We' ve played it a couple of times in the first few weeks after we bought it, but afterwards it is just a dust-catcher. I think the mechanics are fine, it's just that the theme is not really there.

RATING: 5
Decent tile-positional, no-luck combat game.  Good size of components.  Nothing really wrong with the game, if you enjoy this type.  It just left me kinda meh.

RATING: N/A
Complex possibilites yet simple and elegant rules.
Only slight problem is that you have to memorize several different symbols. Each play has more "possibly correct choices" than Neuroshima Hex.

RATING: 4
Two player abstract game, nicely themed and presented.  Each player has ten wizards which can attack in different directions with varying strengths.  The game 'works' but is just not fun.  We both fell into AP.  But I had invested too much effort to agree a draw.  Maybe once you have played a few times the game will speed up.  But there are other games I would rather be playing.

just another 2 player abstract. many mechanics borrowed from NS HEX. 2 player abstracts tend to get a 6 from me at most, with this one I don't see anything interesting to explore...

RATING: 6.6
Solid combat game with some simularities to Neuroshima Hex. Enough originality there to stand on it's own two feat though. Maximizing once actions can be prone to AP.

I really enjoy this game, but I can't seem to easily find others that love it. Same problem I have with a similar game by the same creator: Neuroshima Hex. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Provisional rating, based on very limited play.

Some interesting ideas - a no luck (apart from the powers you get at the start) tactical game.

Rather dry - it is an abstract with a theme tacked on, and I could see it really suffering from AP.

Struggled with the gem colours - they could have used colours with more contrast (only affects inital setup), and also with the 'shot' graphic on the green tiles - which isn't so good as you need to know which wizards can break through shields and I struggled to differentiate them for the 'green' side :(

Overall felt more like a puzzle than a game - might improve with multiple plays.

Need to play it more to form a strong opinion.

RATING: 7.5
Playtested.  I like this game quite a lot.  Although players familiar with the game should crush those who are not familiar with it - it is an interesting brain-burner of a two-player, with plenty of variability.

I'm just not a fan of abstracts, and this is definitely an abstract through and through.  Place your guys on the board, and then capture in the directions that their lasers point.  When you capture a guy, flip it over to your color and stack it on top of one of your existing guys.  There are a few special abilities such as shields that block lasers, super lasers that cut through shields, and talismans that you can shoot to take various special actions to keep things interesting for those that are into these types of games.  As for me, I'll be avoiding.

Neuroshima Hex is better game, it`s abstract in disguise, and I really prefer to play Yinsh (real abstract with similar mechanics), than this one
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It has elements of N Hex! but at a different pace. While it's not as fast 'n furious, it's definitely thought-provoking. It has a measured pace to it with most of the information visible to the players. I guess it's the difference between a duel of mages and a street fight.
Rating likely to go up with further play & appreciation of the subtleties

RATING: 8
I've played three times, including a drubbing from the demo'er at Essen.  I like it.  It's got a really fun, hack-and-slash game.  There's plenty of options for you each turn, and the presentation is quite nice.  Nearly all information is perfect, if you're willing to remember it.  This seems like randomness when played casually...

Definitely more of a thinky puzzly game than it has a right to be by the theme.  But that's not all bad in the right circumstances.

This is a little like our experience of hive - ie it took us many games of Hive before we understood its intricacies.  So this will be the same - and up to now our moves are pretty random.
My wife does accept this though and is willing to give it some time to work.

Quite nice abstract staretegy. Interesting idea of ,,shoot and activate" system. Unfortunately I've found 2 issues to be a little bit irritating: the board and tiles (pictures on tiles are great btw) could've been desgined more clearly; i'm not shure if i like games where your >>only

Rating may grow up after repeated plays.

Not as happy with this one as I am with Neuroshima Hex! I think that is because you need a few games under your belt to truly understand the elements involved. I think that experience is a really good gauge of who will win this game

Well-designed merciless 2-player. Can be quite a brainburner. I prefer the more random Neuroshima Hex!, but this one is also worth a good try.

RATING: 6
It feels less like a puzzle than Neuroshima Hex, but that might simply be because I am less familiar with it.
It's fast, it's fun, it's thinky without violating any of the previous two. I like it.

A brain-crusher.

At first you are completely overwhelmed by possibilities and their interaction.  It seems like it will be a complete chaos and mess.  But later on pieces come together and Witchcraft turns out to be a decent and full of emotions game.  When you start calculating all the options and possibilities you have, it becomes a heavy, strategic game (in a chess sense). To truly understand and enjoy this, you need to play a few games first.

Maybe not exactly my type of the game, hence such a rating.

RATING: 7
After one game using a prototype - this game takes a lot from Neuroshima Hex. The gameflow is quite similar. Nevertheless, the changes are significant enough to make it a very different game - this I'm not yet able to tell.
EDIT: Second play changed my prespective a lot. This is NOT similar to NsHex. Maybe the mechanics borrow a little from NsHex, but the gameplay is completely different. The game was very tense and interesting, the winner wasn't obvious till the very last moment. Note 7 and has a potential to grow.

Somewhat abstract game with special powers.  You're basically trying to take over your opponent's wizards or get them in a position where they have no moves left.  It plays quite quickly but there's enough to think about to make it interesting and the theme really does help make it less dry.  Seems that many games will involve a lot of back-and-forth action until eventually someone gets the upperhand and just starts wiping the floor.  That being said you can still squirrel out of a situation with some quick-wits.

Rating may well rise with repeated play.  Two things detracted from my fist game.  The rules could have been better written, and the graphic design gets in the way of the play in places.

RATING: 8
A real brain-crusher in nice clothes. 

Comparing with Neuroshima Hex: similar with unit targeting, completely different with everything else. First of all: heavier one. You can't lose a battle and see what'll happen here. Entire game is a battle. You make one mistake and you're in trouble. Second one - pray for miracle and do everything you can, because that can be it. Three mistakes and you're dead. 

Good game for long autumn evenings ;)

RATING: 9
It`s probably the best 2-players game I ever played. The gameplay is very tense and full of interaction. Every move is important. There are multiply victory paths. Although game is rather abstract it feel true to its theme. I don`t want play NS-Hex any more. I don`t want play Lotr-the Confrontation either. True 2-players masterpiece is Witchcraft.

Edit: None of my players like Witchcraft. So I have to rate it down to 9.

A fine game but not for me. The game is of type where to win you have to consider all possible options in next few turns. Depends who are you playing with single game might take ages. I would consider it as a chess type game, so if one likes chess then this game might be interesting for him.

Similary to chess it only allows two players and there is no randomness.

A more streamline, and perhaps more compelling version of Neuroshima Hex!.  It plays faster and lighter and feels less like a Knizia tile laying game.  I made the comparison to NH without knowing that it was the same designer.  Well, he has a style..

Easy to pick up and doesn't overstay its welcome

For this kind of game, though, In my mind nothing has beat Light Speed.

Une évolution de Neusroshima Hex presque sans hasard et beaucoup de stratégie. Pas pour tout le monde, mais excellent jeu de ce concepteur qu'il faudra garder à l'oeil.

RATING: 6
This was an interesting two-player spatial duel of characters with various special powers. It was odd because your options became more constrained over the course of the game. There were a lot of possible choices at the beginning, but the choices became more and more limited as you went (sort of the complete opposite of games like Le Havre or Caylus for instance, where the world of possibilities drastically expands throughout the game). While it was interesting, there's a lot of competition in the two-player, thirty-minute genre, as that's a crowded field, so I don't expect this to see an abundance of table time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice abstract two player game with easy rules but pretty deep gameplay. The first player to run out of legal moves loses. The illustrations on the wizard tiles are nice and tiles are pretty thick. Gameplay-wise, the game really adds something new to my collection (although I admit that I generally do not play, let alone buy, abstract games). I also own the bonus wizard tile for both colors. Unfortunately, neither theme or gameplay appeals to my girlfriend.

It's an absolutely wonderful one-to-one battle. I love the mechanics, the colours, the graphics (except for the power tiles). It's a game I looked for: a tactical fight of two groups of individual warriors (in this case - wizzards). Ii resembles chess, but it's far better for me, more interesting, less abstract. And while I don't like chess I LOVE Witchcraft :)

[i]Witchcraft[/i] has an outrageous decision tree that layers the possible moves you can make on the first turn with the multitude of potential outcomes for those moves. I’ll leave the calculations to someone else, but suffice to say that you have a lot to consider, which is both good – the learning curve gives you room to grow – and bad, since those higher up on the curve will likely crush beginners.

Abstract strategy game where you need to think ahead to stay in the game.  It's not going to appeal to everyone but if you want a lighter/faster version of Neuroshima hex with a different theme, you might want to try this.  Incredibly thick cardboard components.

It feels like a (slightly) simpler Neuroshima Hex, but each turn seems more vital than in N. Hex. One mistake here could cripple your position more than one mistake in N. Hex, I believe. Still not sure if I need to own both (and there's no way this would ever stay and Hex would go), but for now, I'm enjoying it.

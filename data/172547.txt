LIKE: Very interesting mechanism of rotating your workers. Quick turns, little downtime. Solid euro (minus the quirks).
DISLIKE: Replayability seems limited because I feel there should be a bit more variation in setups. It is also easy to see who will win a few turns ahead. Should be a point-based game, rather than a race game. 

OVERALL: I feel this should be a point-based game, rather than a race game, because it's too predictable towards the end. Could be a good game with a balanced group, but  it is just optimizing and racing game.

RATING: 7
Fun building game that plays well, but makes you think in strange ways.  The temporal element makes you plan quite a bit.  The rondel is great, but the tavern action is really complicated; it's important and clever, but it's a little counter-intuitive.  Otherwise, a very good game with a thin theme.  I love the random setup of the point-race.  If the box was smaller, I'd consider buying it.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
This is a race game to build the Queen's Palace before any other players, but to get there, you need to groom a cadre of competent artisans to slowly but surely maintain increasing amounts of prestige. Using a rondel, you have to balance lending status of bonds, point-to-point movement, a shifting artisan market, and the semi-mindbending fatigue levels of your artisans as their possible prestige output changes after each time they work a job. This is a unique take on "engine building" if I ever saw one.  

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
This could be the most AP-inducing game on my shelf, but it's really not intended to play that way. Instead, I really enjoy the tactical approach not only for swift play but because it captures the feeling that your troupe of artisans is really racing against known rival organizations around the countryside. My Glazier and Mason might be flagging after the last job, but I don't care--I have to get to that abbey ASAP and complete their contract before my opponent. Okay, done--now my workforce is in better shape, but my Blacksmith just tapped out and is gone forever... but I got four talers, prestige, some bonds, and a free hiring action from that last contract. Okay, back at it!

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
See my comment about AP. There are some people I never want to play this with because they'll just get clogged up going about their gameplay the wrong way. Overall, my rating on this one has cooled since we played it a lot in 2015/2016.

RATING: 4
Mechanically simple but the way that the workers actually work and trying to understand how to really put them to use and manipulate them takes a play or two to really understand. Very neat mechanic. There are no rules for altering the stack of worker tiles for less than 4 players but the game clearly needs it. No catchup mechanic means that it can be incredibly tough for anyone to catch a runaway leader which makes the game much less fun for everyone. While they can and probably will lose workers, it's usually not enough to slow them down too much. End game mechanic stinks; if someone triggers it, you have exactly one action to try and better them - if you're not in exactly the right position at that time, your last turn is completely worthless. Really wish there was something better for that. Sold at FallCon 2015 auction.

I really enjoy the spatial and motion aspects of this game, how you're filling up your action star with workers and then rotating them back and forth depending on if you've used them for construction or sent them off to the tavern. It's pretty cute, like an action rondel surrounded by mini rondels. Also the motion of how the craftsmen move up the track and can eventually get eliminated from play if nobody hires them (like workers that leave your area), and the Appreciation track you are climbing for victory. Components and artwork are lovely, theme is light here but not necessary beyond that. Great design for those seeking a medium weight game advanced just slightly beyond those gateway Euros.

A little neat optimization/race game, with little player interaction.
Players compete to build the Queen's palace, but first they must complete some preliminary jobs, completing/restructuring other buildings.
At the heart of the game there are a rondel action selection mechanic, and the idea of "aging" craftsmen: after each job, the workers used "decay" and in the end they must be released.
The game is potentially interesting, in some "feldian" way, but falls slightly flat as regards excitement. Anyway, will gladly play again.

I appreciate the design, which I think is solid, and the game contains elements of other games I really like: a rondel, circular timing mechanisms (like the Wind Rose in Macao), competition over building spots, etc. But for some reason they all come together in an unsatisfying way here.

I think my biggest problem is that, due to the wildly differing distribution of numbers on the worker tiles, it is hard to plan multiple turns (or builds) in advance. This, on top of the scroll chart on the side of the board, makes for too much arbitrary calculation. This means what could have been a solid strategy game becomes a cumbersome (and very repetitive) tactical Euro game, which doesn't appeal to me as much.

Nice little rondel game with colorful, cartoonish artwork. It's not very heavy so it would make a good step beyond a gateway game and a good introduction to the rondel mechanic. It has nice replayability but a bit too much luck for a Euro game in my opinion. A player could really get stuck in a bad spot depending on how the various artisans come out.

Quite intersting and unique central mechanism. You have a rondel to which you attach worker tokens with different abilities, that fluctuate in power every time you use them. It carries the game well, and is quite absorbing and brain burny. Low interaction, some luck of the draw, a step above family weight, similar weight to Palaces of Carrara. 

A few minuse: the anticlimactic finale, the uninspiring box cover, and the slow and perhaps underdeveloped "eat-sleep" cycling mechanism. Also, the fiddly and error prone artisan lineup should have been streamlined more.

Quite enjoyable overall, and a possible hit for Queen.

Really enjoyed our first play of QA.  Love the individual rondels where you're not competing with anyone for resources or space, but trying to time and optimize moves.  Initially spend time building up a workforce, then try to keep them rested for peak building performance.  Fire them if needed to recruit fresh workers.
Great stuff!

Queen's Architect. Cara doesn't know how much she likes it but holds out a fair amount of optimism. I thought it was kind of long and repetitive. It has varying strengths and durations of craftsmen tiles as its main trick. You just go to the place when you have those tiles showing, due to you previously hiring them, and then you can build there for however strong your craftsmen are right then. You can fiddle with them to rotate them backwards but that may cost you time and it is a race game. Do not ever rotate them backwards and they will leave if you use them enough. Theme wise I was reminded of an anime that I only watched a few shows of called Spice and Wolf. It was okay. I won and we are now going to try it again.

Remember you can only make repairs with a max of 3 craftsmen.

3 plays. Well, my verdict is this is much like the feeling of playing Cinque Terre but it is worse. This is not a game with lively gameplay, but it is a different kind of game than we have currently, and it works well. It functions.

But there is an air of something different that I am feeling a growing appreciation for. Almost a palate cleanser. A super filler.

I underrated it. And now I have overrated it maybe. It confuses me, the idea of how much I like this one and for how long.

Players are master builders, managing a troop of medieval craftsman that travels from town to town, building and repairing.  Craftsmen are recruited, and "spin" when they work, rotating to a different value.  Whenever your troupe works, they move you up a ladder based on the quality of their work, and first to the top wins.  Nice game of managing your cash and workforce.

It was ok.  I liked the step-function building-point mechanic and I liked how the guildsmen stats rotate.  I think the designers could have stopped at 2 circle-based mechanics (guildsmen and actions), though.  Everything is a circle and it's just unnecessary.

In Queen's Architect, players must manage various workers to quickly gain the appreciation of the Queen. The various ways players may rotate these workers creates a satisfying puzzle to solve each turn. Workers can construct buildings, repair something (what exactly, remains thematically very unclear), day labor for cash, or rest at the tavern. Each of these actions will allow players to rotate their various workers in several different ways, and offer the core of the game's decisions. The addition of a variable appreciation track creates a decision space wrought with arithmetic, which will thrill some and agonize others. I enjoy it, but be warned, you'd best bring your abacus because this Queen is one mathy monarch.

It got a rating of 4,5,5 and 6 from the 4 players of our one and only game.

It looks great and is well produced.  The craftsmen mechanism is unique and clever and the scoring system is also very novel. So why the low ratings?

1. We had issues with the craftsmen hexes getting rotated the wrong way. If you suffer from clockwise/anticlockwise motion perception issues then this is definitely not the game for you.

2. There is no mechanism to change the available craftsmen and we had an issue where two players needed a lumberjack with none available.  The other players did not need a new craftsmen.  Neither of the two looking for a lumberjack would purchase another craftsmen they did not want so as to allow the other a chance to buy the any new craftsmen entering play.  We discussed this afterwards and thought an additional option on the recruit action might be an option to replace the available craftsmen. 

3. It just didn't hang together for us as a fun and well rounded game.  We kept thinking that we should add house rules to get around some of the issues we encountered.  not a great sign.  Perhaps a potentially excellent game lurking under some badly developed and/or written rules?
We wondered if it was possible to just win by repairing buildings and not bothering to build.  I'm sure that would get you some way but might require something else for the 9 score tiles.

A szokásos queen games játékokhoz képest talán egy leheletnyivel bonyolultabbak a szabályok, néhol meglepő módon kifejezetten nem elegáns, érezhetően utólag beletett dolgok is vannak benne szerintem (pl pihentetés). Maga a központi mechanika érdekes, jópofa, bár tematikát senki se keressen benne. :)
A forgatósdit kicsit nehéz néha lekövetni. Nem kevés múlik azok, hogy jön-e olyan melós, amilyenre éppen szükséged van, emiatt körökre be lehet ragadni, bár némileg segíthet a renoválás opció ezen, lehet hogy ezt elsőre nem használtuk eleget, és túlzottan az építésre koncentráltunk. Nem rossz játék, de nem is kiemelkedő, kell még neki esélyt adni.

For a simple race game, Queen's Architect is quite heavy on the mechanism front. Even with the full player count there is hardly any interaction at all, and the game is primarily in optimizing your personal craftsmen rondel. The mechanism used for exhausting your workers is quite similar to the one used in the football/soccer game Finale, except a little more fiddly.

Rondel style game that has a neat mechanism where your hexagon worker tiles rotate and give you different points based on how rested/experienced they are.  

You need to manage your workers properly but it isn't difficult to do so.  After a while you basically feel like you are doing the same things and it gets a bit boring.  A saving grace is that the turns move very quickly so there isn't a lot of down time here. 

This is a light optimization game.  If you're into that sort of thing check it out because I'm sure it will hit the table for you from time to time.  If you're into more heavy strategy games this one probably isn't for you. 

Overall not a terrible game and there is variable set up so each game is a little different but even with that it's not a game I will want to play over and over.  

I'd like to see the rotating hex mechanism in another game.

Everyone acts from their own rondel, acquiring a collection of workers to build buildings. You need money to do things, which you can get a number of ways, and building gives you points to climb a ladder and/or things you can turn into money with an action. Once you get to the top of the ladder, you need to build one more time to win.

Queen's Architect 的遊戲時間不長，機制上的運作卻讓玩家覺得有點難以掌握，但又說不上算計及思考，有時招募不到需求的工匠著實蠻懊惱的，雖然有補償的機制--修繕，但似乎並不是那麼給力，公佈欄待招募的工匠變成遊戲中難以預料又很重要的關鍵點，造成的影響是，玩家會捨不得讓自己的工匠退休(被操得半死XXD)，因為一旦推休就可能雇用不到，過了這座山就再也看不到那座廟啦~
無論如何，包裝的確是會讓一款遊戲加分許多，就像是剉冰都是冰，淋上不同的醬料有著不同的風味一般，Queen's Architect 成功做到這一點，在美術及配件的加持下，遊戲還是為玩家帶來許多的樂趣~~

I love the puzzle presented by this game. Timing which actions to do, and when to do them is loads of fun (i.e. painfully challenging). In particular managing your build strength is interesting. You have to carefully plan which actions you want to do and how that will affect your workers for future actions. That part of the game is brilliantly done.

I have never cared for race games and this one suffers from a lack of rubber banding which is quite common in the genre.

A light-medium weight game all about being the best builders. Fatures a cool rotating orkers mechanism which makes for some very interesting choices.
Due to the wealth of open information there's some cool player interaction in the form of recruitment and where to build when to race ahead.

I also really like the ending. Not with a counting of points but with the player that actually built the Queen's palace.

And another game I have no real problems with, I just simply find it bland and not that interesting overall. I appreciate that it's a race (race always adds some fun tension to games), I like that it has a strongly randomized set-up, and it's also fine that rounds go fast and downtime is really low. The use of workers might be called innovative and the way workers are "updated" remind me of the purple cubes in Terra Mystica. Yet, it still did not feel exciting enough for me and I just can't find the reasons. Maybe it's got to do something with the very low level of interaction and the board being bigger than what we needed for our play (again, not nearly enough interaction - there was no village used by three different players and there were a few that we did not use at all). The latter might have happened because the game set-up is randomized to a level where it might be a bit out of control: what constructions need in villages is randomized (highly - almost 50% of the tiles go back to the box), what steps you need to take to reach victory is randomized (a few tiles go back to the box here as well), which workers appear on the market is also strongly randomized (many of them never appearing during game). As a result, everything feels a bit accidental, and probably that's why the game felt bland to me overall.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

It actually works well as a game but it is dry as a bone. The workers and how they work and turn/fatigue, etc is interesting, but I wish there was more of a game attached to that mechanic. One is basically working their own personal rondel to be the most efficient the most quickly to race up and build the queen's palace. I've never been a huge rondel fan either, so that doesn't help my impression of the game.

A gem. I wasn't expecting much, and I got a great really good game. 

Pros: 
-It's short (less than 1 hour with 2)
-Beautiful production 
-Fun (racing game that doesn't bog down)
-Easy to learn (I'd call this gateway plus)
-Plays GREAT with 2 (though I would close off some of building squares on the board)

Con's
-The rotating mechanism is this game's achilles heel. You rotate your wheel (central mechanic) one way for 2 actions and another way for a different action. It's difficult to explain, but extremely important to get right. A player could inadvertently rotate their star the wrong direction, which could have a monumental impact on the outcome of the game. It's not a deal breaker, but something that could keep this game from becoming a classic. 

All in all, I'm really happy with it. Highly recommended racing game that plays great with 2!

Some clever ideas, but ultimately the game has very little appeal beyond the first one or two plays. It becomes repetitive and dull. Also, many games have a runaway leader. Off to the trade pile.

Would like to play this one again, but I'm not sure my second impression would erase the first.  The random worker tile draw made the game sluggish for all four players.  The workers have seemingly arbitrary numbers on each hex vertex, so a worker may be exploited for day labor, but actually become stronger.  Doesn't make sense - but again, I'm willing to give it another shot now that I know the rules.

This game has a lot of potential, but it falls flat IMO.  It's aimed as a family game, and in that capacity, it's probably just fine.  Rahdo's video had me hoping that it was something more...a cousin of one of Feld's designs maybe.  Unfortunately, it's just not quite there.  I'd like to see a little more creative interaction with some sort of catch up mechanism.  In a race game (which this is), you really need something built into it.  I beat my wife up in this game, and it's honestly not a lot of fun because of it.  With a little more finesse, this could be a killer game...

A hidden gem.  Love the spinning worker mechanism (though my wife has a lot of trouble knowing which direction to spin.)  It's a great weight, a little lighter than most mid-weight euros but with some meat.

RATING: 6.7
First of all, I really like the idea behind the game: using workers for several actions and  rotate them, take action within the action star (build/repair, redeem bonds, move, hire new worker etc.). Hence the mechanism is really likeable, but unfortunately the game feels not as fun as it should be.
I have two main issues with the game:
1. it is essentially a race game (not a fan of it), the winning player can often be detected several rounds before the game ends with no or little chance to catch up.
2. IMHO there are too few points of contact in the game (speaking of a 3p game, in a 2p game much more).

In future plays I will try some of the variants the author published, maybe this gives the game a new spin.

Apart from that the design is lovely!

I really enjoy this game, in it you are travelling through the land, trying to do work that will impress the queen enough that she will choose you to be her architect. You assemble a band of craftsmen to work for you, earning prestige (and a little money here and there) by doing construction and repair work around the land.

Each player has an action star where they move a pawn rondell-style around it. You can earn money from day labouring, hire more craftsmen, exchange bonds into money, travel to a new area on the board, rest your craftsmen in the tavern and do repairs/do construction. You may only move your pawn up to three spaces.

Craftsmen are depicted on hexagonal tiles that you place in each of the nooks on your action star. Each craftsman has a numerical value on each corner of the tile, depicting how good they will work for you at any given turn. When you work a craftsman you will rotate the tile with the arrow (when you rest a craftsman you will rotate the tile in the opposite direction), changing how well (s)he will work the next time, and also determining if the craftsman remains in your group or leaves it.

When you earn prestige, you may choose to advance in the queen's high graces depending on the required amount, any prestige not used towards this will be given out in bonds that you may trade in for money at the bondsman. The first player to advance to the top and make it back to the capital to make a minimum 15 point worth of construction is the winner (if more than one player manages to do so in the final round, the player whose craftsmen have contributed the most prestige is declared the winner), so it's essentially a race.

I really enjoyed this game, it has a lot of a puzzle element to it, where you try to find the best combination of craftsmen to not only fulfill the criteria of any given area, but also to accumulate enough prestige points to move ahead on the track, but not to overdo it as each area is capped at a certain level of prestige and you want your large contributions to happen in the larger cities where you are allowed to earn more prestige. Absolutely recommended.

Intriguing game that has actually improved on further plays. Balancing the craftsmen's strengths and how and when to work, rest, or replace them is pretty interesting. May not have a ton of longevity, but still into it.

It does suffer a bit from repetitiveness, and no one else seems to want to play it with me, so sold.

Feels almost like a pure race game. It is a wonderful practice in efficiency in engine building similar to Splendor but a little more meaty and a little less random. The variable set up has a positive impact on replayability but not so dramatic that it might damage certain plays of the game.

心得:
是一個蠻算的遊戲
主要是要長線規畫什麼時候需要產生多少分數來爬軌
爬到差不多就回到中間慢慢修理
然後累積到可以一次15分來勝利
沒有累積什麼的感覺 有點無味
規則:
*分數捲軸隨機抽9個任意順序放在左邊軌，照各鄉鎮大小隨機放對應的需求版塊，價格黑方塊放在右邊雇人區最上面，挑出18個有背面有驚嘆號的工匠版塊洗勻，剩下的也洗勻放在此堆下面，然後正的開在雇人區，在根據人數在旁邊開兩倍的工匠版塊
*起始工人版塊由起始玩家順時鐘選後在逆時鐘選，拿到的時候可以刻意轉N格來或得N塊錢
*每個人選擇一個顏色拿走所有配件跟2個債卷，一個人放主圖版左邊下面，一個放債卷兌換軌，一個放行動板塊最上面那格，六個職業方塊放在酒館入口
*工人拿到時根據雇人的位置對應到行動版塊的箭頭，每次使用會轉一格，最後一格用完就會離開
*每輪每次可移動行動軌1~3格來做對應動作(可不做動作)
1.工作賺錢 主行動版旁工人數除2拿錢，無條件進位，有對應行動的工人可以轉一格賺2元
2.雇用一個工人 付對應位置的錢並轉到對應方向，如果滿了可以直接解雇雇新的，一個人不能有兩個一模一樣的工人，如果最上面沒被雇，移動價格標記，移動到4之後下次移動清掉此工人，然後所有工人往上移並開新的
3.移動 花錢移動馬車對應格數，沒有獨佔
4.銀行 增加兌換指數，或是債卷換兩元
5.酒管 付對應金額逆轉對應數量工會(同工會一起轉也只算一份錢)，工人標記順時鐘移動
6.建造或修繕
>建造要符合該區需要工人，每一鄉鎮一個玩家只能蓋一次，馬車要在該區，所有工人會貢獻數值(即使不是該區需要的)並旋轉，值總和減掉蓋的位置扣分在根據鄉鎮的分數上限拿到貢獻分(鎮有額外好處)，利用貢獻分爬左邊軌，超過的部分都可以換成債券(可故意不爬)，所有工人轉一格
>可派最多三個不同工會且有修繕技能的工人修繕，獲得修繕總額的分數來爬軌，只有修繕的工人要轉
**當有人貢獻給皇后，該輪結束就結束(馬車要在首都)，工人不用旋轉，如果只有一人完成就該玩家獲勝，不然就比完成該輪的分數總和

ok game, but not too excited after 2 plays. Seems to be some inbalances in the game. Road to victory seems to pretty much ignore the pub/sleep option since it slows down the rotation speed. Travelling more than 1 step is hardly ever necessary. Money doesn't seem scarce enough.

"Solid quick-playing medium-weight euro, which is a race. The randomized steps of the score track are brilliant. It's fairly dry, but has enough theme for me."

What I like:
- Seems to play quickly
- Plenty of interesting optimization decisions (with enjoyable randomness)
- No player attacks, but the race aspect, location penalties, and worker market allow interaction
- Randomized board gives nice variability

What I don't like:
- Rotating the hexes around a star is a bit fiddly

I would put the weight around 2.8. I could see some people getting analysis paralysis at times, but it's probably more fun to think a bit, make your best move, and roll with it.

One play with 4p. I made an early mistake which soured my play. And then I got a bit screwed by the random worker pile. It is light and somewhat interesting. I'd like to try it one more time before deciding. Rated 6 for now.

Another play with 2p. It zipped right along. I like the mechanics, but I'm not sure it adds up to a game I love. Still a 6.

And a play with 3p. Yeah, it's fine.

Queen's Architect is a fun efficiency game with a few flaws. It's relatively easy to tell who is going to win by halfway through the game unless it's extremely close. The tavern action is generally not action efficient enough to bother with, and it's far too expensive to justify using it on a large number of worker types. In addition, it's an extremely strategy focused game, with very little tactical play. If everyone plays fast, particularly at 2 player, it should be fast enough that the flaws won't bother me, but I'd really want to get through this game in no more than 45 minutes for how much I get out of it. If people take a long time with their turns, the game will become agonizing.

A fast-paced game of optimisation which is actually quite novel for a Euro because it's a race to the finish. Instead of the conventional resource gathering, players obtain workers whose values change each time they are used to fulfill a contract. Once a worker reaches his metaphorical limit, he is permanently retired from the tableau.

For a game which finished under an hour, this has a bit of a high rules overhead. The biggest problem for me is that turning the workers in the right direction can get surprisingly confusing. Still, I have soft spot for designs which function as fairly transparent puzzles.

I was somewhat dubious of this game at first, but to my surprise I ended up enjoying it. Managing your architect's travels provides a decision-tree each turn.

Beautiful components, love the theme; enjoy playing. However, there are a few design issues that from this first time designer. The 6 random values on the tiles are all over the place and make no sense. However you know what you are getting if you hire them. 

Possibly broken rules are allowing someone to get and own all the bonds. Also Rebuild as a strategy is so easy to do compared to a build. 

My biggest gripe is that it almost impossible to read the total values of the current and future values of a tile, when placed at 6 different angles around the star. The good news is that there is a simple solution. Just don't use the star but place your tiles in a row and everything becomes clear. 

That said, an experienced player should be able to cope with these issues so willing to upgrade to a 7.

Race game. Hire different colored guilds/craftsmen to construct, repair buildings for prestige points which increases your reputation.  The game is good, but has some issues. No blocking, the game feels quite solitare, there is no direct interaction. Too much money in the game. There is also the fact that its quite mathematical; and its better to keep your workers and not buy new ones unless they are strictly better as killing them off actually harms you more than help you.  Probably would play one more time, but I don't think its a keeper.

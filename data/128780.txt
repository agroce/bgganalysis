GAME: Pax Porfiriana
RANK: 373
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In terms of feel, Pax reminds me of a game that Carl Chudyk could have created; it is a game where you try and make something solid out of amorphous chaos. Difficult to learn, mechanically fairly easy to go through the motions with, but difficult to master (it took me close to 20 games to really build a cohesive plan and read other players actions properly). It's thematically rich with lots of flavor text on every (hideously ugly) card. Much like Indonesia or other games that make little/no attempt at scaling compensation, the game space shifts with different player counts. The 2p game is a duel where someone has to take a chance and break away to work on a different topple objective while 4+ is a game where the game becomes more unstable in terms of victory coming out soon (and game space in general). 3 players gives a good balance of downtime and ability to play the other two people against each other to your advantage. In particular, I find the end game conditions of "Diaz + 2p" to be an interesting method of ending the game. It's been said that "Pax only lasts as long as it's supposed to" which is probably true; but it's true because the game becomes more unstable as a game environment as it drags on (much like Chudyk's games, but for a different reason), which in many ways is also thematically accurate. To compound this, you only use between 1/3rd and 1/2 of the cards in any given game and each game spirals out of control in wildly different directions compared to other iterations. It is such an interesting problem-space in terms of how the game can turn out, even if the basic premises stays the same each game (get cash, then points, and prevent others from getting enough points).

To that end, it's a game that I think is really interesting in terms of telling a story (if I could be bothered to read the flavor text that is...), but occasionally I wonder how effective the game really is in terms of play, for example, look at the victory conditions and how they (at least in the C.E.) change at various player counts; at high player counts, it's almost too chaotic without the variants, and at low counts, it loses a certain spice. Solidly best at 3p (which has it's own variant ending condition), and I'd avoid playing at +5p if I could help it. In particular, two player is a duel which falls over on occasion, while 3p you can still manage the game space well enough and you don't have much downtime, but can still play other people against each other. In general, it's almost more "simulation-ist" than "game" compared to Chudyk's offerings which flip that. It teeters on the edge of greatness on more occasions than it achieves it and after +12 games of it, I'm not sure if that's related to the topple design, or something else entirely. Ultimately, I do find that I enjoy it, especially at lower counts (at 3p, I'd give it a solid 8, but everything else it's a 7).

One difference between this and the other Pax games is that Porf is interested in asking players to manage a tableau and stack their hand of 5 cards so that they can leverage all 3 actions on a turn to sprint out front and buy a topple in a flash of brilliant chrome. Pax Ren/Pamir is more interested in board play (especially Ren). Porf is unique in that regard, but whether I like the chrome "gotcha" victory is up for debate. I can't get it tabled at home anymore, but I'll gladly play someone else's copy at an event.

150909 The game has never recovered from the bad night. Still very much respect the game but the rules overhead makes it a tough one to get back out.

130929 After a run of good luck, I ran into a disastrous game night where two 5P games of it both fell flat.  Its still a great game but don't mess with 5P unless you have experienced players.  And maybe the Iron Hand variant.

121231 Great heavy game in a small card box.  Like other Sierra Madre games, its a bit rough at the edges, but its a fully developed game (unlike Bios:Megafauna).  Its heavy and can run long, but it is truly a fun brainburning experience.  I suspect it should be played with timers for people prone to AP.  There is a lot of room for AP in this game.

RATING: 8.75
Initial rating is a 7. Still trying to get a SOLID grasp on the rules, but there are a few questions that don't appear to have answers. This is definitely a 9 if they get cleared up, but without knowing for certain, it dampens my enjoyment of this title.

With that said, this is thematic as all hell. It's a definite buy, for certain... I just don't know where it fits on the scale, that's all.

UPDATE (Dec 2015): Following roughly 20 more plays of this (Vassal, face-to-face with 2-4, solo), this is really solid, and quite deep. It has a press-your-luck mechanism that works really well from a political perspective inside the game. I'll never turn down a game of this. The trick, however, is that others tend to do so. Thanks to rickyroyal, there's a strong (and tough) variant that plays very well solo, in those situations.

One of the most unique and thematic games I've ever played.  I enjoyed it, but it went a bit long and the inability to have many long term plans because of all the chaos take it down a bit.  Gameplay is fairly opaque and there is a lot of small text on the cards.

Oh my god, where to begin… My first though was, yay, it is a card game with an interesting theme and proven mechanics. Players buy cards from the market to build an economic engine in an attempt to gain enough power for overthrowing the goverment. Sounded like my type of a game. 

To my disappointment I could not find much positive about the game. You quickly get a hang of the basic mechanics but I really have to say that this game teaches you to respect games with elegant rules.The game is infested with small detail and rules. Complexity would be ok but the rulebook is poorly structured and badly written. We had two people, accustomed to learning and teaching new games to everyone, read the rules and neither of us got a clear picture of the game just by reading.

However, the biggest let down was that complexity does not translate into meaningful depth here. Cards interact with each other very weakly except for the restricions on their play. You are just laying individual cards into your tableau to primarily either linearly increase your income or to give you the prestige required to topple Diaz from his throne. The engine building part is practically non-existent. Some cards do give you special abilities but they did not seem all that significant (e.g. steal from other player, destroy a card, prevent an aggression played against you). You will max out with your economy quite quick and after that you are waiting for suitable prestige cards only. But even with the prestige it is basically just a matter of luck whether you can win or not. This is because the chances to trigger a premature game end are scarce (one of four Topple cards in the deck), and it requires you to have significantly more prestige of one type than other players (there are four different types), and that the current regime asks for the particular type of prestige points you have (there are four different regimes). If the current regime is wrong or if some other player buys and discards the Topple card, you can only wait for the game end tie breaker asking for the most money. Meanwhile there are almost no interesting decisions to make and all you can do is to participate in the tug war for having the most prestige and money.

In a nutshell, for the majority of the game you are just waiting for the celestial bodies to align themselves. The only thing worse than the game, were the rules which had an illogical structure and failed to give a good basis for playing the game.

RATING: 8
2p solo test-drive. The sheer number of cards in the draw deck (207), and the fact that you use only a fraction of them in a game (70 in a 2p), suggests boggling possibilities for variability and replayability. The dynamic of every game will be [i]very[/i] different. 

I worry about the perceived rules density (seven pages of glossary terms?!), but I'm somewhat reassured by the comments here.

[i]Update 11/17:[/i] Wow, I love this game. Lots of interlocking mechanics, wheels within wheels, but it plays fast and smoothly. Pax Profiriana is a great tableau builder, hugely variable, with near-constant player interaction. It's a lot of game in 90 minutes. Totally enamored. This starts at an 8 and has nowhere to go but up.

RATING: 9
A top game that rewards careful & meticulous play. Humorous too: you may have to choose between your wife and the dynamite. Downsides are too many identical black assassination cards, & the Topple process victory conditions, which might usefully be re-examined. I suspect the different Topples & their points are too discrete for design perfection ie. it might be better if, in rare circumstances, Diaz is forced to retire [i]at gunpoint[/i], or a rigged election following a US invasion still results in a Communist government, in spite of everything. The game would be easy to modify, as all you need to do is remove some cards & add replacements. A ratings problem with games such as this is that people act on minor faults more readily.

I am not a very big fan of pure card games.  This game has a interesting set of mechanisms that keep it from feeling like multi-player solitaire.  There is a lot of screwage, but a careful player can mitigate attacks somewhat.  The theme (Mexican Revolution) fits nicely.

My rating may go up or down once I play a full game.

Strange game. Seriously. The art is funky and the rules interactions come across as a little arbitrary to me... I'm not saying that's *bad*. Just weird. It's a weirdo. There's no getting around it. But is it a *good* weirdo?

I don't really know. Right now I think it's okay. I'd be willing to try it more and find out if I think the game's logic clicks and gets more fun. I don't think it's ever not going to be somewhat random as the win condition cards pop out whenever and who knows what sorts of crazy, catastrophe stuff will come rolling down the marketplace. Perhaps a greater understanding of the game's potential could unlock greater strategy... or perhaps not. Dunno.

RATING: 7
Some commenters suggest that Pax is an evolutionary step forward in Phil Eklund's designs; the design in which deep immersion in theme is at last married to some eminently playable mechanisms.  Up to a point, I'd agree.  However, Pax does have some reminders of the Eklund of old; like the dog's breakfast of a rules set, with important rules hidden in examples and a glossary; like a degree of chaos due to playing with a subset of the full deck and which rises with the player count; like a system equally prone to rapid blowouts and drawn-out slogs.

So why is Pax staying in my collection - for now?  It goes without saying that it has a strong thematic fidelity to a highly chaotic period of Mexican history.  The interactions of many thematic cards do create a memorable narrative. And the game gives you a lot to think about; your strategy must constantly adapt to the mix of cards you are presented with and to the actions of your opponents.  I regard that as both a positive and a negative; I want Pax to be a wild thematic ride like Eklund games of old and there it is, like a Rosenberg design, keeping me constantly calculating. 

Production quality is pretty decent and the artwork is evocative.

Very thematic and very tense!  You are always just one action short of what you want to do.  Do I want to sell out for a single point type, or take a more balanced approach?  Should I work to prevent anyone from successfully toppling Diaz and stockpile gold?

After two plays, this is becoming one of my favorites.

Pretty funny chaotic game with so many cards with so many moving cubes.  The quirky details and chaotic play are strangely endearing and distinctive, almost like a Mexican history flux game.

When you are dealing with so much historical obscurity and quirkiness, coupled with an interesting variable end game triggering mechanism, it does seem to provide some distinctive adult amusement value.  You have got to be kidding me with that card!  Nope, this is the game.

Buen juego de cartas, sobre todo muy temático. Ilustraciones graficamente muy chulas pero un poco caóticas, algo que no facilita un primer acercamiento. 

Elevada curva de aprendizaje para encajar todas las mecánicas y opciones disponibles y ser capaz de elaborar estrategias a medio plazo. Las posibilidades son tantas que en un principio resulta un poco abrumador. 

En el lado negativo, puede que todos los escollos que he comentado hagan difícil el encontrar 3-4 personas más con dedicación suficiente para poder disfrutarlo. También adolece de cierta falta de fluidez debido al análisis-parálisis que implica evaluar las mejores opciones cuando llega tu turno.

Es necesario jugar más para evaluarlo correctamente. De momento es solo un aprobado.

May 2013, after playing with four: With more players this is a fantastic little knife fight over who has how much of an advantage in each of the five main areas (four types of prestige and cash).  The variability in the deck is huge, as you use less than half of it in each game.  This as well as other mechanics contribute a lot of chaos: the game is essentially about trying to steer the chaos towards a desirable outcome.

March 2013, after one solo play: This seems to be much more of a game than Phil Eklund's other offerings.  I'm not sure that the included solitaire variant is worth playing.

RATING: 6
This is a very serious card game and the cards are fantastic. PP is a fine achievement for its historical narrative and design alone. I really enjoy poring through the cards.

However, during gameplay, there are always 12 cards on display for purchase, and you need to examine and mentally integrate all of them (even when it's not your turn) which takes time and can drain your brain. Plus there's considerable randomness and uncertainty here (although great replayability) because only some of the cards appear in each game. I'm also not 100% sure I like the "toppling" method of winning the game. 

After reading the rules four times and a pair of two-player games, my enthusiasm has waned. I really wanted to love PP, but it doesn't have the "flow" I crave, and I've sold the game. Still, PP really is a triumph, a fantastic simulation and "magical history tour," but not super-playable, so with mixed feelings I have to give it a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A take-that cardgame, with a bit of area majority or whatever you want to call to the factions mechanic. As usual in Eklund's games, as a game, it's pretty bland and uninteresting.
The sheer amount of history (and not the usual) included is great, and that really is Eklund's strength. That alone justifies playing this game once or twice. But for the game itself, there's just tons of games that do well what he's trying to do.

The cards graphic designer/producer deserves a kick in the nuts.

RATING: 7
I found this somewhat difficult to rate.

On one hand, I really like the theme. After all, I live in Tucson - so seeing cards like "The University of Arizona" and "The Pasqua Yaqui" are pretty awesome. It isn't every day you get a good dose of southwest history in your board game.

On the other hand, this game really isn't anything special with regards to game mechanics. At its core, it's a tableau building game with somewhat of a modified winchester draft. There is a lot of downtime as the cards are not particularly well designed (although, I'm also somewhat fond of the art - so I'm conflicted here too).

All in all, the game suffers from the same problems every other Phil Eklund game seems to: bloated rulebook and inelegant mechanics, but a fairly deep game. It seems like there's a LOT that can be done, but in the end it's a card drafting game that takes a solid 3 hours to complete (and an additional hour for explaining the intracacies to any new players).

All that said, however, I still want to purchase it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Truth be told, I find this game intriguing from a mechanical and historical point of view. But ultimately, I don't find it fun. For one, the game has a huge amount of randomness that is barely mitigated by the drafting. This isn't Through The Ages where players can plan around a finite distribution. This is a game where a huge number of cards are removed, where the topple cards are randomly placed, and where players essentially jockey for position while hoping that a specific card comes out. Secondly, the gameplay often breaks down into a game of bash-the-leader. And finally, the artwork is horrendous for teaching/playing the game; it may be accurate for the time-period but when iconography is nothing more than a mirror-image, the gameplay is going to suffer. 

Ultimately, this is a game about managing chaos, which some players may love. But as a euro-gamer, this game overstayed its welcome by several hours.

RATING: 7.5
Hard to rate after only a couple plays, but a typically intriguing mix of history and game-play from Sierra Madre games.  I love the unique them and even the goofy crazy card designs.  It might be a little too swingy, with too many "take that" elements to be one of my top games, but despite the sort of average rating, it's an above average design.  Really interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple (but fiddly) game that improves on Lords of the Sierra Madre by stripping out the mostly needless board play and making some numbers a bit better. This isn't a difficult game to learn by playing, but (like most Eklund games) the rules need work and there are special cases that may catch you unawares.

Rating -- Indifferent

Ok. Hmmm. On one hand, you have to respect Phil Eklund and his pure originality of spirit. On another hand, he should respect the progress of the boardgame community. I think his games are brilliant but they require some SERIOUS streamlining. Hire a graphic designer, for starters.

I saw some great mechanics in this game. However, it still feels like it's in playtest phase: although it is quite balanced, there are elements that feel rough and exotic...in a bad sense. Phil's games are extremely hard to rate.

Excellent fluff, of course. Hated the simple "take that" interaction, but liked the compensation.

Pax Porfiriana is a unique blending of a tableau-building card game, dripping with theme.
Each of the more than 200 cards is unique, and has historical fluff text and artwork.
Gameplay is a dance on top of the wave: each player needs to start an economy, while playing attack and defense at the same time. All this while jockeying among different forms of regime and seeking support to overthrow the regime itself.
A wonderful game I want to explore in depth. Initial tentative rating is 7.5, but it could easily go up...

Initial Impressions: This is a deep card game in which the cards serve multiple purposes. The win condition mechanism is clever and achieving the conditions are like hitting a moving target which the players get to move.

Maybe too heavy for me, maybe the rules are too complicated, maybe the cards are too overloaded, maybe....

Well, in my group nobody was really fond of this game : it was too hard to play : struggling, slow play, not enough entreprises, discussions about the rules, how to turn the game in your advantage and so on.

Despite the wonderfull integrated theme the game just didn't work.

The game is amazing fun, chaotic and nasty, but also rewards careful attention by the player.  The history is great, I can just sit and read cards for hours, and then visit wikipedia for some new history.

The graphic design is the only area of the game that needs serious help - my eyes, they're bleeding! just look at the quick redesign a BGG user has done to see what a difference it can make...

RATING: 10
Pax Porfiriana is a card-drafting tableau builder that is so self-assured it allows for the action to be almost completely player driven. There's lots of chaos in this game, and the chaos can be maddening/frustrating in certain instances (e.g., my selected path to victory ended up being wrong). The chaos makes it work: if players knew what cards were coming, it would be far less interactive. The meaningful decisions come once you understand that each player is suffering from the same chaos, and it is your job to manipulate and traverse the card-based landscape most effectively. The more you play, the more you are able to ascertain the current landscape. Add all the above with the bits of thematic flavor and context the cards provide (Eklund's politics don't seem to permeate the card text), and you are left with a very enjoyable game.

In this game, you are a self-interested, corruptible, ambitious "hacendado" that, aside from a bit of asymmetry, is competing against a set of mirror images. The game play is pretty simple: you draft cards, you build your tableau, you throw roadblocks into your opponents way, and you recover from your tableau being destroyed. The management of those tasks is compounded by the variable end-game victory checks that occur throughout the game. The "take that" of the aforementioned roadblocks is so interwoven that it doesn't feel mean. Further, the "take that" is balanced by the fact that the more you target a single player, the more you are bringing that player closer to victory. The player interaction is not relegated to only "take that" either, as you can mold player incentives and create informal player alliances in certain ways.

All that praise out the way, the deck construction can cause certain sessions to be either (a) less dramatic than others or (b) slower than others. Much of that is due to the distribution of available cards being out of the players' hands. You do not know when the deck has run out of the regime change you need. You do not know whether there are enough of a type of prestige cards to make the corresponding victory achievable. That lack of player control can break the game for some players: if you go into a game completely set on following a certain strategic path, you will likely lose. While some board game designs are enhanced by more player control, this is not one of those games. In this instance, the unknown chaos of Pax Porfiriana serves to enhance the game. Indeed, the unknown chaos of the deck actually provides a better sense of the game's theme--international politics, political turmoil and revolution--and a lesser game would pretend there exists an almost perfect agency in such situations. Sometimes power grabs fail.

This is one of my favorite games but it also highlights a problem with the BGG ratings - I will not always feel up to teaching this game and it is only going to work with people who are open to a large rules overlay, a little fiddliness and some unusual rules that can take a bit of getting your head around.  However it is a wonderful gaming experience - hugely thematic, wonderfully interesting and surprising.  Although very "take that"-y the cruelty is deminished by the fact that most of the time you do something bad to someone they usually get something good for it (outrage VP, ability to use an extorting troop to quell unrest etc).  I am eager to try the new "pax" games but I still feel I have so much to explore with this one I am in no rush.

:d10-3:
I think this is at its best as a 3-player game, and I'd go so far as to say it should only be played with that player count. With 2, you lose a lot of the cool multiplayer dynamics, and with 4 (or heaven forbid, 5), the downtime is longer, the game is more chaotic, and the rules are slightly more fiddly.

Ultimately, the horrible UI dooms the game from entering my top tier. With a complete graphic and textual overhaul, this could be up there with Innovation and Magic: The Gathering as one of the great special power card games. But as is, it falls short. 

Old Comment: The mechanical design is inspired. Pax Porfiriana feels like a marriage of Through the Ages (draft and card play) and Innovation (scope and shifting tension points)in all of the best ways.

The theme doesn't particularly excite me, but the mechanics of each card are clearly inspired by the theme and affect the game state in thematically intuitive ways.

As with other Phil Eklund games, there are times when the theme hinders gameplay. Luckily, here, it's mostly relegated to the graphic design and user interface. Card icons, game text, flavor text, and period photographs war with each other for attention, making the game state difficult to read at a glance. Turns would be long enough with all of the interlocking game dynamics, but the graphic design doubles the length. That said, by my second game I was beginning to differentiate the relevant information and speed my gameplay.

I could see this going up to a 9 if the multiplayer game is nearly as interesting as the 2-player game, but I fear the additional players may add similar negative effects to Through the Ages (game length) and Innovation (chaos).

Por dios! el manual parece un relato corto! Se agradecen la cantidad de ejemplos y aunque quedan alguna cosas oscuras, supongo que en tiempo de juego se aclararan. Las cartas, demasiado finas para mi gusto y aunque si caben en la caja enfundadas, estaría mejor un poco más de espacio.

Leyendo las reglas es brutal la escenificación y todo lo que se puede hacer por el país.

RATING: 8
Rough going on the first play.  Obviously fairly deep, but also very fiddly for what it is.  Two players was recommended, but I think it was too difficult to gain the sufficient advantage to topple with the limited dynamics, tit-for-tat play and ease of tracking the opponents strength.  Being forced to the gold-based ending in this way left a sour taste in my mouth and was the longest possible end condition to boot.

The large marketplace makes the game difficult to analyze even for those not prone to AP.

Will try with 3 players and hope it both expands the dynamics as well as shortens the game with a different end condition.

-- Update: tried at 3 and 4 with experienced players.

Very much turned around my opinion of the game.  While I still wouldn't recommend it at 2, the game unfolded in different directions each time.  Every opportunity to Topple felt pulse-pounding, with each player angling to bring about the regime to their own particular strength without drawing too much attention to what they were doing.  The only downside is that the outcome is entirely dependent on calculating the state of the board in its entirety.  One missed card (with miniscule text) among a broad field of them is the difference between success and failure, and most attempts were miscalculated in our games.  Trying to clarify with the player what's in front of them (say, could I see what kind of point you have under that cube there?) tilts your hand and can be ruinous in and of itself.  Nevertheless, the vast opportunities to mess with each other and build your own enterprises in different ways allows for plenty of opportunity to explore varying strategies within the limitations of the portion of the deck available to a particular game.  Recommend, even for a long game and fiddly rules.

This is a great game held back by some obtuse rules that really work against the design.  There is a lot to take in and digest.  Once you're up to speed the game plays smoothly.  I recommend learning this from an experienced player since the rules are brutal.  There are some really cool ideas in this tableau style card game.  I think you could play it a dozen times or so and still discover something new.  There is a TON of game in that tiny little box.

RATING: 2
So my bad rating comes from two things: I didn't like the game, but I didn't like the UI even more. The UI made it nearly impossible to play. The cards were nearly unreadable from a distance, bad contrast. The art was fine, but when your art can't be 'read', then you have a problem. Nearly unplayable game IMHO. That said, even if it was playable, I wouldn't like this game, but I'd rate it at maybe a 3-4 instead of a 2. The game boils down to you just trying to get the most WXYorZ, where which ever one of those you need keeps changing, plus you have a bunch of 'take that', and you end up with what I would call a dud. I accidentally made a 'good' turn, and by accidentally I mean I was trying to 'win', but then realized by doing that, I extended the game to be even longer, and that's when I realized how bad the game was. I would rather have let the other player win just to get it over with.

Beautiful game. It really immerses you in a fascinating historical period that you might not otherwise be aware of or even care about. After the game however, you really get interested in the subject matter. The creator has really put in a lot of time to research the subject matter and the game is way better for it. IMO, Phil Eklund's magnum opus.

Managed to give this one a shot. As just a card game, a lot of the flavor of LotSM is missing - even if the cards are filled with historical information.

Game is interesting, with lots of choices. It falls into the kind of gameplay that Illuminati or Cosmic Encounter has - lots of interaction of parts which must be continuously assessed to see if you (or someone else) can win. Key elements were difficult to see at any distance though, and the amount of analysis isn't my cuppa any longer.

It took me several plays to appreciate Pax Porfiriana, but its potential was clear. Unfortunately, I found it hard to find opponents. That all changed when the game was playable on Yucata and then its brilliance was revealed to me. The game has many things going for it: a strong narrative, great interplay variance, room for backstabbery and politicking and huge interaction among players. The thematic integration is also a big plus. A really outstanding game (with the right crowd).

Interesting game...  only one play so far, but I enjoyed it.   Initial impression was skepticism due to the busy-ness of the cards, and the chaotic looking gameplay.

This game is fantastic-ish. The rules are complex but make a lot of sense. Game-play is fast and the seemingly endless combinations of buildings, armies and affect cards make for an almost infinitely repayable game. Unfortunately, the almost impossible to read layout of the card heavily detracts from the overall game. If the designers made extensive efforts to streamline the symbols and placement of required text, I can't see why this game wouldn't be a 9.

Version pulida del viejo Lords of sierra madre que ya era un juego bien majo aunque demasiado largo para los estandares actuales.

Esta version es un juego de draft muy tactico. Hay que controlar las cartas en la mesa y lo que te da puntos al final de la partida (hay cinco formas de puntuar) Muy divertido y el juego tiende a terminarse.

Lo que si es impresionante es el detalle historico, cada carta es una narración y si juegas este juego montadote una pelicula el juego te ayuda con miles de detalles reales.

RATING: 9
I really liked this one, SMG has again managed to take one of their old, unplayable monsters (Lords of the Sierra Madre) and turn it into a really great, compact package that retains all the essential elements of the original.

Yes, it's crazy chaotic, but there is definitely a lot more feeling of control than in Bios: Megafauna, for those who found that game unsatisfying. I was pleased that it's not hard to bootstrap and you can get income up and running fairly quickly. The real challenge will hit when the economy goes into depression, which is likely to be rough - make sure you have some economic diversity (farms, rails) to see you through, don't invest everything in banks and mines. Also, understand the four factions and their linked government states, prestige points, and succession plans.

It's still a highly reactive game, like Republic of Rome you're going to be playing to stay flexible and seize advantage of opportunities as they come up. Unlike Bios: Megafauna, you fortunately have more tools to do this.

The one caveat is that the game does need to move at a reasonable clip. It's not going to be a problem for most, but you'll know if you have an extreme slow player or an AP trap in your group, in which case it might pay to be a little careful.

Anyway, SMG games are always unique, which is something in a crowded marketplace of very similar products. This is relatively cheap, and if you don't mind somewhat chaotic games, definitely check this out. Great historical backdrop excellently melded to an entertaining game.

Deep, engrossing, and unique.  It has this odd quality of satisfaction as you're playing a much heavier, epic game than what it really is.  Really enjoy how indirect and unclear the strategy is as it makes for an enjoyable problem to untangle as you play.

My main criticism or at least nagging observation is that the game is really much simpler than it wants you to believe.  It obfuscates a simple overall system with layers of complicated blind folding in order to make you believe it's more sophisticated than it is.

I like it despite this lack of opacity, which says quite a bit.

RATING: 6.5
I have never tried a game by Phil Eklund before, and this was a quite interesting experience! The rules were hard to grasp (as I understand is the norm with Eklund’s games), but it might be because I hadn’t read them beforehand and that I definitely prefer to read the rules (and even explain them to others) myself. During the first game I didn’t really have a clue about what to do, but in the second game the strategies became much clearer, and the game was significantly better because of this (after the first game I would probably rate it 5).

It’s definitely the most complex card game I have played (though I haven’t played a lot I have played Glory to Rome, Innovation and RftG). I like complex games, so this is definitely a plus, and I was really surprised that a card game can actually be this complex. Furthermore, the replayability is great because you only use a fraction of the cards each time, and considering it’s a card game it’s actually quite thematic.

However, the game is not without flaws. The biggest downside of this game is how long it takes to play! If you want to become good at this game I think you need to play it quite a bit, and as the game takes 2 hours to play I just don’t see myself playing it a lot in the future. Also, as it’s a card game there is a fair amount of luck involved, though I think there is still room for strategic and tactical decisions. Also, 12 cards are visible each round which gives you a lot of decisions to choose from. 

A negative aspect was that I was actually able to end the game 15-20 minutes or so before the topple-card was revealed and I was allowed to do so. While the gameplay probably justifies a better rating as the game is actually good, I cannot give it a better rating due to the issues I’ve written.While I did like the game, I don’t see myself playing it a lot due to the length; if I have 2 hours, there are many other games I would rather play.

Too many rules and too long for what it is attempting to accomplish.  There is a lot of take that, and taking steps backwards in progress, for my tastes.  The cards are extremely busy and not very functional.  That being said, I can see a depth in what is happening and I think after more plays with experienced players the playtime could go down a a familiarity of the cards could get me over the initial hump, or it may not - I'm not sold on it yet.

:tobacco: :what: :) :D :) :what: This is a game of infinite bare-knuckled screwage on a wild frontier. Money is a means to acquire power; power is a means to acquire money.

[i]Everyone[/i] is on the take. You can have a crony build a slave plantation and reap some profit, use the proceeds to have another crony build a gun store, hire a group of tequila-soaked renegades, have them buy their guns from your gun store, and then send them off to sack your own plantation, incite a slave revolt and be hailed as a liberator of the people. This appeals or it doesn't thematically. But it's decidedly a black and gray morality tale, and don't get too attached to anyone you meet along the way because just about everyone's going to end up dead or in jail, which is surprisingly historically accurate. As previously noted, [i]The Wire: The Card Game[/i], only everyone's wearing serapes.

Mechanically, this is a chimera -- more than a bit of Through The Ages, a fair dollop of crazy-combo card games like Innovation &c., and a dash of the nasty take-that games a la Munchkin. Except it's more of a free-form random setup with a stronger more thematic narrative than TTA, it replaces the anti-thematic dream logic of Innovation/GTR with, y'know, theme, and unlike Munchkin it requires thought.

It's portable, reasonably affordable (when available) and backed by ungodly amounts of Unnecessary Research that went into the flavor text and back stories for each card. Poker chips preferred to the bog-standard plastic tiddlywinks that ship with the game.

It is, it must be said, an ungodly pain in the ass to teach. There's a lot of systems and things that are interacting and things that almost seem like they fit together logically but there's that one thing. Three jurisdictions, two countries, four factions, four types of government, four corresponding types of ways that the dictator can be toppled, two different win conditions (on points or on gold, depending). Nothing optional, no easy mode, nothing you really can leave out the first time. Your country cousins may not appreciate this as an alternative to Uno. Maybe they do. Maybe I'm underestimating your country cousins. But forewarned is forearmed.

Once you have a rough idea of what the hell you're doing, the game does hang together and is actually quite straightforward and quick. But you aren't getting to that point without a fight.

Also, the cards? Hard to read. Damn hard to read. Meaningful text, flavor text. Lots of flavor text. They did their homework and it shows. But? Takes getting used to. I'm used to it and I've only played a few times, so it's a problem that can be overcome but it's worth keeping in mind.

I could probably give the paleolibertarian politics and goldbuggery in the manual a miss but I really don't care that much about the politics of my card games.

Bottom line: once you learn it, it sticks with you. It's fun and it can be fast. And it's as thematic as you get with a deck of cards. But the operative phrase is "once you learn it." If you don't want to put in that time for what could in theory be viewed as a gussied-up Innovation, more power to you. But I disagree.

1 play, 3p, like many aspects of it. Like the combined interests mixed with competition and multi modes of game state. Don't have all the rules down yet. Many of the card types seem easy to understand at a glance. However... Some of the cards seem like a special action category that requires reading the text to understand. How many plays would it take to merely glance at a card on display and know what it means? In general I found the game clever and thematic.

RATING: 9.5
It's an amazing distillation.  Phil Eklund returns to the Lords style game with a vengeance.  I'm a couple plays in and it's hard to express how satisfied I feel.  Needless to say, this game is a scream--I can't believe so much theme has been packed into so few rules.  It puts robust budgets of many ameritrash titles to shame.  

Update:
Okay, I have now played the game five times, once at every player count.  I think the four/five player game's may be the most interesting, but the others are good too.  I think the larger games are better because they allow for the very real possibility of a money victory which I think adds a nice component to the game.

At it's heart you're looking at another tableau-building, combo-chaining card game filled with plenty of "take-that" moments and built with an eye toward's Eklund's theory of history.  However, unlike every game in that genre, there is a real sense of movement and geography here.  Your cattle empire spreads across mexico.  Your troops are sent to sack the casinos of your opponents.  Slaves revolt in the southern plantations and are liberated by scheming rival tycoons. 

A lesser designer would have encapsulated these moments of drama from the revolution into some event cards in a manner like card-driven wargames.  And, indeed, these kind of events do exist with the game.  However, by-and-large the players receive only the props, sets, and actors and are left alone with their own fertile imaginations to concoct the scenario.

Like many of Eklund's games, there is a gesture to the "storytelling" genre.  But, most storytelling games are isolating experiences.  Tales of the Arabian Nights is the classic example here.  However in this game, rather than making the players less dependent on one another the game constantly intertwines them.  This is perhaps best manifested in the movement of money.  At the start most payments are going to the bank, but it's not long before the market is filled with speculators and various land monopolies which channel money into other player's coffers.  

Suffice to say the first barrage of plays have yielded very positive results and I'll be interested to see if my group's experience is indicative of any larger reception.  If the game continues to hold up (and I suspect we are only in the outer orbit of this game's potential), Eklund will have at least an equal to Origins or perhaps best game yet.

RATING: 9
This can be a crazy and chaotic ride, but I like it because it represents a crazy chaotic time in history, and does so very well.  I am loving games like this where mechanics, theme and just overall gameplay combine to create an experience.  There is a story arc to each game as players jockey to be in just the right position when the topple cards come out, and are desperately trying to throw the wrench into their opponents works.

The rules, as you know by now, are "difficult" to get through, and even watching some of the play-through videos will leave you with head scratching moments, but once you get into the proper flow of things, it moves along pretty smoothly.  Most importantly in a game like this, those little rules exceptions make thematic sense with the time period, which makes them easier to internalize.  The tough part is learning the proper rule to internalize.

Excellent game. Love the individualism and historic flavor of the cards, the unique nuances after each play based on the cards you see, the shared at times incentives, and even the take that nastiness and card chaos. 

After a few plays you know the basic levers and traps, and you can better guard against bad draws. Make no mistake, negotiating with your opponents is necessary to make the best of this game. 

A great system, and a lovely, smart, dense little package. Must have.

This game is greatly improved by printing out the player mat. I need to make a better copy though. Now that we knew what position everybody was in, planning became far easier and we finished much quicker (though in hindsight we could have drawn it out longer).

This game is a gem. The gameplay is very emergent, the playstyle not intuitive, I ended up raiding my own place with some pink military just to knacker my opponents economy that depended on mines. There are a lot more plays left in this which is why I've upped my rating. This may increase further.

Rating is tentative as I've only played this with the solo rules, which does not do a good job of representing this game. I have a basic outline of how the game is played, but there's still a lot that doesn't make sense to me. I'm fairly convinced there is a great game in this package, but I really need to play with other people to understand it properly, and I'm fairly certain it will take multiple plays to get a good grasp of what to do. That said, the rules are an absolute slog to understand and I'm hesitant to ask people to play at this point in time. A very unfortunate catch-22 situation. I love how the rulebook and the cards provide a lot of historical insight, it's like an edutainment board game!

I enjoyed this quite a bit, especially after I started to understand it. Unfortunately, it was difficult to get to the table due both to theme and its seemingly convoluted nature. The game actually isn't as complex as it appears, but it sure looks complex and is hard to explain easily to others. The cards appear a mess but make sense after a game. Too bad...I really think I would like it if I could find a group to play regularly.

One of my top three games. 

It's unlike anything else; you can spend turns with no idea what you're doing, plan meticulously only to see well-timed strife tear your plans apart, endlessly switch allegiances to prevent anyone getting too far ahead (while trying subtly to get ahead yourself) or suddenly find yourselves all cooperating to prevent a depression. 

It always tells a great story and makes for a great game experience.

Highlight: 2016 (October 2016)

Very interesting and interactive economic card drafter. Winning conditions are defined by the current Regime, with an elegant balance existing between the frequency of Pax vs. non-Pax regime effectors and effects, and the ability of players to manipulate those Regimes. Some 'take that' elements disrupt the strategic flow of the game however, and not the biggest fan of the theme. (May 2016)

This is a provisional one-play rating. Good game here for sure. Is it a masterpiece, as some have claimed on this site? The jury's still out on that for me. I really like the interactivity and the theme that oozes from every card, cube, and chip in this game. But it's a little messy, with some rough edges and it's a tough game to learn or to teach. Still potential for it to go up, though. I would like to discover more of the clever card play that's apparently here.

Not at all as convoluted I thought it would be. Quite easy to play actually, but hard to play well I guess.

Three plays in I think it's a good game but not spectacular. I have nothing against randomness, but the card draws in this game (as you only use 1/3 to 1/2 of the deck) can get wacky.

There should have been a playmat included as well, but that is at least easy to print out yourself.

RATING: 8
Players play a Mexican hacendado, or noble patron, trying to grab a slice of power during the time of Porfirio Diaz.  Slightly mind blowing card drafting game, where players purchase cards off a Through The Ages style sliding marketplace, and play them into their own play area, representing their holdings.  Cards are broadly classified as Enterprises (to supplement their income), Troops (to leverage off your opponents, or defend your own stuff), Events, and so on.  Players spend three actions per turn to purchase and play cards, with the ultimate objective being to accumulate badges in four different spheres of victory.  These badges will be assessed when a "topple Diaz" card is played, but the sphere of victory depends on the current style of government - which changes between four different types with alarming frequency!

Incredibly chaotic game, which isn't unexpected for an Eklund game, but this one is easier than most to penetrate and is rather fun once you understand what is going on.  Slightly overhyped here, but still good stuff.

Don't be fooled by the size of the package or the fact that this is a card game, this is one of the meatiest, best game of the year. Lots of little hooks ooze all over this game, just waiting to dig deep and drag you into one of the most intense gaming experience of the year.
Using the familiar card drafting mechanic of paying less for the cards that have been out the longest along with the familiar economic engine tableau, this game tells a strong narrative of the birth of Mexico, with lots of opportunity to shaft your opponents and twist and turn to victory. 
Again, simple game at first, but once you get going, you can see opportunity at each action and always wish you had more actions to keep going.
Well worth getting and playing often.

The game seeps atmosphere and feels like the experience it is simulating.  The problem is that the gameplay systems are not at all intuitive and the rules are a disaster, the result is a game that is difficult to understand how to play.   The rules would benefit from a complete rewrite with some clearly illustrated gameplay examples.  I refer anyone to the rulebook for Dominant Species for an example on how this should be done.

Rating gone up to 7 now.  This game gets better and better.

Up to 8.   Fantastic.

very thematic card game about building a power base then trying to topple the president in revolutionary mexico. Uses a simple economic engine, take that, and set collection mechanics but in some interested and interlocking ways. Most cards have three or more important bits of information on them, and do multiple things (such as earn you money, count towards a set/victory condition, and infer a special ability) so the game can seem confusing a first, but its actually rather simple. Somes with 220 cards which i think are all unique. You will only use half of these or less in a typical game, so lots of replay and variety.

Fantastic game on the Mexican Revolution. My friends and I have played Phil Eklund's Lords of the Sierra Madre multiple times and really enjoyed it. This takes the core elements of that game and puts it all into a much more accessible package that is, if anything, even more fun. The elegance in the design is truly something to be admired. Bonus points: it's also highly educational! Highly recommended!

Based on a single play in which I didn't get to do all that much, I enjoyed this game quite a bit. The theme is outstanding, although it will take a few plays to become familiar with all the text, as there is an insane amount of text all over these cards. Regardless, the play is easy enough to make decisions, but has enough room to ensure there is a strategic, brain burning game within.

Artwork is not very good and cards look a bit chaotic at the beginning, but they are totally functional. Will keep a close eye on this one.

I thought I might like Pax Porfiriana, but I knew I didn't have the group for it and quite frankly I was a little concerned about the amount of effort it would take to even learn the game.  But, wow, am I glad I made the jump!  This game, nay, this [i]experience[/i] that pretends to be a game, is more than worth the effort. 

I just simply don't have the eloquence to do this game justice so I am going to keep it short and sweet.  I read a review somewhere that likened Pax Porfiriana to riding a wave of chaos...  And I think that about sums up how I feel about it.  In a nutshell, it's a game of extreme adaptation that unfolds telling a different story every time.  IF, that sounds appealing to you, then I am certain you will love it.  IF, you like the surgical precision of pure strategy and low interaction, then this will likely feel too messy for you.

As a side note, you really don't even need your group to get into the game at all (although that would be awesome) as there are [i]plenty[/i] of like minded hacendados over at yucata.de willing to ride the lightning with you.  (And some damn good players to boot.)

It's a keeper and near the top of a short list.

[1 play] This game shares with many others the same basic scenario that makes card games frustrating and unfun: The game is full of cards and the cards are full of information. Every player has a tableau and there are more cards besides. To play the game usefully or intelligently, you have to know what all the cards are.  And it's hard as hell to see everything. 

However, it got better over the course of the game. The graphic design is crowded and inelegant, but it's not useless. 

What a game like this requires is playing a few times and getting familiar with it. And I liked it enough that if anyone in my circle played this game, I would be willing to. Eventually I think it would be a lively tactical game. 

It's also packed with theme and historical flavor, and I really like that. I didn't get the maximum appreciation of it because it's an unfamiliar theme and I was busy trying to figure out how to play, but this is definitely something I'd appreciate more over time.

Almost great.  For me, it's just too long, and has too many loose ends in the rules, given how much luck is involved.  The pace can go almost entirely from the game an hour or more into it, if everyone loses their enterprises (their wealth generation) from in front of them.  We enjoyed it but all wanted it to end, after 3+ hours.  I love the rich theme integration and the history-packed cards.  Opinion is after just one play and discussion with some more experienced players.

RATING: 9
Pax Porfiriana, like its sister game Pax Pamir, is a brilliant sandbox for player creativity. I’m becoming increasingly numb to euro efficiency games and more receptive to games that offer a place for players to be creative. Both P-P games offer this type of experience in their own wonderful ways.  Like Pax Pamir, the framework of the game is building a tableau of action cards with a heavy dose of player interference and attacking -- and room for really clever play. 

The basis of the game is building an action engine via a card tableau. Cards offer offense, defense, or an income infrastructure so you can start making money for more cards. At the beginning of the game, most people are building up their income but soon the hijinks starts. The game is heavily interactive where you can leech off other people’s cards, extort them, or downright destroy them. Attacks are mitigated, however, in that the target player receives a prestige point which aids them towards victory, so you have to consider your attacks carefully. Or better yet, you can attack yourself and destroy something to give yourself a prestige point. The point is, the cards offer a wide open space for player creativity.  

And it’s so not obvious how to get to victory. In fact, I’m finding games like the two Pax games and A Study in Emerald have a sharp dividing line with people which I attribute to how they put the onus on players to figure out both ends of the equation – what will win me the game and how do I make it happen? Until they grok the experience, players may feel “there are no good options” but it’s just that they can’t see things clearly yet. For me, I love treading water until I find that right moment to catch the wave of opportunity and make a play to win. [i]Chicks dig surfers, man.[/i]

My only complaint with the game is that we've gotten so good at playing defense, games frequently go un-Toppled and trigger the default money victory which I find so boring. I'm happy to hear about a variant whereby Diaz' defense goes down by one starting with the 2nd Topple revealed and plan to try that next time.

[b]The components[/b]: Well, the cardstock is good. I don't really like the artwork (the cards just seem too busy) but the iconography is clear and nicely visible. The cubes are good but I don't like the chits. Why couldn't there be coins in the "collector's edition? I don't need it to be metal, cardstock would do perfectly well. But instead they are boring, white, blue and red plastic chits. 

[b]The theme[/b]: I know almost nothing about mexican revolution but I believe that all the mechanisms in the game capture the theme perfectly. And it is deffinitely unique.

One 2p game. Intrigued, as usual. Seems like it could be rather lucky in what cards come out in a game but 1) I only played 2p, and 2) I imagine after a number of plays one could work out how to mitigate any luck.

The graphic design of the cards drives me nuts. Wish the cards had a more uniform, consistent design rather than every single one looking like a unique entity. Really frustrating when trying to learn the game. Eyeball overload :(

The b/f asked a lot of subtle questions about this one before Christmas, and so I did a little research. It sounds interesting and a lot of people who like it really like it.
That was enough to convince the b/f to pick it up and so he acquired a copy of the collectors edition.

He was every unimpressed with the contents when he broke the shrink wrap however and the cards art is, and I quote
[size=18]  ":yuk:" [/size]

The b/f finished the rulebook, but was deeply unimpressed. 
Poor component quality (even in the collectors edition) was just the final nail in the coffin for this one which we were completely apathetic towards to even bother to remove the shrink wrap from the cards.

Real game here : solid mechanics, fast paced & full of tactical decisions, surprisingly simple at its core but with ample challenge in its subtility that the learning curve is both steep & constant enough. Due to the nature of the solo version, you need to change gears often & adapt yourself real fast which helps setting the atmosphere of Mexico in the turn of the 20th Century. The theme goes through well with the good amount of research that was put in the actual historical events which translates well both in the cards (flavor text) & in the rulebook.
Potentially  too much randomness solo (as some AI decision are actually ruled by a dice) but as long as you are willing to adjust your strategy on the fly, plays well.

What results is one of the best games they've put out.  I would probably shy away from this with more than three players, though.

RATING: 6
Pax Porfiriana is a fairly simple game at heart but there is quite the rules overhead to get there. It doesn't help that there is a crazy amount of necessary and unnecessary data on the cards which makes getting an overview very difficult at first. The vast number if different cards further complicates things and playing with inexperienced players you can easily double or triple the playtime on this.

Once you've gotten through the initial haze the game essentially boils down to a typical multiplayer conflict card game - everybody keeps everybody else in check until someone somewhere either manages to make a surprise move that catches the others off-guard or until noone has any more means to stop someone else from winning. I really don't understand why the "Euro" label gets thrown around so much with this game.

With that said, Pax certainly has a few features that set it apart from the competition and that make the usual (mis)features of this kind of game more palatable. Many of the take-that cards, for example, are either not that brutal or come with a compensation for the player hit by their effects. The game also places a few restrictions on which effects can be played when and where so even though there's quite a few swings of fortune in a game it never breaks down into a free-for-all brawl.

Quite obviously the many cards with lots of historical flavour also help with the enjoyment of the game. Whether that sort of veneer is sufficient to make up for the high ramp-up cost, though, I'm not yet sure about.

Pax Porfiriana is a complex, extremely thematic tableau building card game simulating the struggles of pre-revolutionary Mexico.  Players represent hacendados, power-brokers in northern Mexico, attempting to succeed/overthrow the Dictator Porfiriano Diaz.   You are constrained by number of actions in accomplishing several goals simultaneously:   growing your economic base, building support for specific types of regime change that favors you and preventing your opponents from doing the same.  Takes a few games to get the rules down, so it requires some patience.  My one tip is in case of confusion, think thematically, I find the rules makes more sense when looked at through the lens of the theme.  Lot of variance game to game as more than half the cards won't be used in any given game.

Appears ridiculously complex for a card game. I must admit, that it appears intimidating, and I've played hundreds of games (and was a wargamer for quite a time). Is it worth the effort? The rule book is rather dense. That being said, as a former graphic designer, I love the artwork on the cards- but for a game, the layout can be busy and very confusing. This game is not intuitive & quite difficult for beginners- you're going to really want to be deeply interested in the subject/theme in order to learn. Definitely a game that appeals to a specific type of gamer, but for me it is too much work.

Pax Porfiriana is an excellent heavy card game for 1 to 6 player.
The goal of the game is to topple Diaz by having more prestige point in the current regime (there are 4 different regime that changes back and forth throughout the game) than Diaz (who has 2) + the prestige of your 2 opponnent with the least prestige in that regime.  Money can also win you the game if nobody (or multiple player) topple Diaz.
You do so by buying cards from the market (cards that are there for a long time are cheaper than the new ones).
There are many types of cards :

- Enterprise are played in front of you and gives you income every turn.

- Troops are played on Enterprise and can change regime and give prestige points.  Troops on opponent's Enterprise steals income from it.  Troops played on your own Enterprise protect it and remove unrest.

- Partner cards give you a special ability and/or prestige.

- Headline cards are played immediately and have multiple effect and often change regime and/or cause a strife (force all players to discard one color of cards in their tableau).  The 4 topple card that can end the game are Headline cards.

- Black and Orange cards are use to cause unrest, steal money or assassinate partner.  It also give prestive point to the victim so it can be played on yourself.

Pax Porfiriana is the most heavy card game I've played.  It take a while to learn from the rulebook but its totally worth it.  There's also a solitaire variant that is OK to learn the game but not as much fun because it loses all the interaction that a multiplayer game has.
Using only 70 to 110 random cards (depending on the number or player) of the over 200 included makes it very different and unpredictable each time you play!

Toppling Diaz is tough.  Most of the games I've played were won by the player with the most money.  The only time I manage to topple Diaz was probably the most satisfying win I ever got while playing a boardgame!
I want to play this game more because everytime I play, I have hope that I could have the same feeling again.

EDIT :
I Topple Diaz again and it was an amazing finish!

I can see that Pax Pamir is a very different game from this one. There are, in my opinion, more differences than similarities to the game, which would warrant the owning of both games in one's collection, should I also like Pax Porfiriana. 

The art, which I dislike, portrays the mexican revolution quite well with its turns and twists and crazy happenings. A lot of chaos is ensured, and in all of this there is you who tries to navigate it. But it is just me, since I'm not into the setting and all things mexican really don't turn me on. 

I'm not bought on the 'build revenue then nationalize it to get victory points' strategy, and it is - for now - a major turn off for me. 

My first game left my head scratching. I want to play this again to make all the pieces click.

This game becomes drastically more interesting each time I play it. I feel lucky to have accidentally discovered it. Worth investing in.

11/13/2014: Finally upgraded this to a 10. I always love playing this game and frequently choose it over other games I've preplanned to play when it's time to set up.

Its combinatorial space is gargantuan: no two games are alike, at least not in this lifetime. But a strategy should and can form for each player if you have 5 games or so under your belt.

Nothing like Innovation, and yet I can see why people compare them. You have to know the deck and the general strategic landscape to play well, and yet it's tactical and combo-heavy. In any case, I was a little surprised to find that I liked it, but I do.

I only know Greenland, but Phil Eklund games are an aquired taste, none the less Pax Porfiriana is quite more accessible then Greenland. Tableau builder with a market which remenisce-like feeling of games like Through the ages and Nations in that regard. Lots of different cards with their own rules and thought process whom are interlinked with other cards and situations. 4 games played yet very different from each other due to the fact you only play with roughly 1/3 ~ 40% of the cards. Daunting at first, very enjoyable.

just getting started with this deep game, but wow, this is a great design.

alot of the feel of Republic of Rome with much less rules and playtime.  while it is still power politics, the interactions are more subtle and victim-awarded prestige makes 'take that' gameplay very likely to backfire.

what not to like?  well, I wish the cards were the quality of High Frontier, and the small-box packaging leaves some things to be desired (deluxe edition anyone?).  also, just like High Frontier, the complexity of play (not necessarily rules) will limit the ability to draw in players.  while not a problem for me, several of the people I have played with commented that some of the card text is too small (mainly the flavor text).

while I am not a fan of having the rulebook glossary contain major aspects of the rules, it is effective enough I guess.  I would prefer a more conventionally written rulebook with a large illustrated example of play.  For now, the strategy articles and rules questions on BGG are enough to play.

didn't hit me that well.  It just seemed like it didn't flow well.  BUT, everyone I played with enjoyed it more then I did,  I enjoyed it some AND I can see that plays will be different enough in character.  So, it gets an extra point for a game that others enjoy and I like more then others I play because others like it.

I'm not sure that the weird scoring system compensates adequately for the semi-random hoseage encouraged by the numerous "take that" cards. Add to that the capriciousness of the deck, whereby you might see cards that help the game-state along or you might not, and you have a package that doesn't quite seem to justify its rules grit or its playing time.

RATING: 7
Such a near miss. The game is an unending stream of interesting ideas. Rapidly fluxxing tableau building; global variables altered by one persons play; player triggered economic consequences; income based on conquest of other players things; points awarded to people you screw over; variable deployment costs based on level of development. Every mechanism is deeply tied into the theme, and makes you feel the chaos of the period. Every decision to buy is tense, every troop played out is a game changer. But the victory conditions are so hard to meet that nothing ever happens, you can alter the game state slightly too quickly to make the buildup meaningful. 

It's an excellent, enjoyable set of mechanics which don't quite, but almost, support their scoring system. I will always play this game if asked, but I will never recommend it.

Easier to learn than I expected. It probably helped that I am familiar with the political concepts at work in the game. Still, this is what I suggest: (1) Jump forward and backward in the rulebook as you go. That is, start reading on page 1, but follow the in text references to the glossary and to other parts of the rulebook as you go, and when those new passages also have references, follow those too. I go about 3 degrees of separation before I return to where I originally was reading. By the time you get to the end of the component overview you'll have read most of the rules. (2) Set the game up and follow the great video tutorials. Read the player aids in the file section. (3) Play a solo game for 3 players to its conclusion, consulting the rules as you go (make sure you shuffle really well the first time). 

If you do that teaching your first game will be a breeze.

Eklund is at it again (and I mean this in a good way). This game offers interesting and rich thematic decisions, room for clever and cut-throat card play, as well as risk/reward system that allows you to stay in the game until the bitter end if you're willing to take chances.
Having only played Eklund's BIOS:Megafauna prior to this, I can see certain concepts coming back with a vengeance. Notably, the card line returns (and returns with a growing valuation -- a much needed modification given that this game produce a much less granular form of income) as well as the ongoing need to "weather the climate" (however, instead of the game grinding you down through new species and climate change, the climate here is political and is much more player controlled). Overall, a big game in a small box that doesn't disappoint.

Pax Porfiriana is a terrific card game which focuses on the political power-players in the tumultuous period which ended the presidency of Porfirio Diaz in Mexico, and features highly interactive play, as players struggle to gain dominance of one or more vectors to overthrow or to profit most from the government.

This game has shades of many games, from Race for the Galaxy/San Juan to Innovation to Illuminati and even to Fluxx.

Card play can greatly alter the situation on the ground, other players' tableaux, and how the game will be won.

This is game where you have to be watching your opponents, and crafting your responses or changing the ground from underneath them to snatch the win.

It's a terrific game, but I cert6ainly don't grok it well enough yet to really capture it in a nutshell (assuming that is even possible).

I'm going to start this at a 7.5 for now, but I could easily see this rocket up- it's just that good.

Good game so far. Need to play with more people.

What the hell happened with the graphic design though!? You know things are going to be bad when a website is part of the card backs. The designer must have no sense of why graphic design is important to learning, playing, and selling a game. Also, why the hell didn't anyone say something to him before he printed the damn thing? There are 3 designers listed. The one guy (Phil) is the main designer and "artist". Why didn't the other two say, "Hey, uh Phil this game looks like complete shit." Those two should honestly be ashamed of themselves for not speaking up.

One of the deepest card games around. The theme is rather obscure (well, I'm talking from a german perspective here), but IMO that's a good thing. You get the chance to learn a bit about a previously unknown historical topic and let's be honest: do you really want the 12000th game set in the middle ages? The mechanics of the game are very interesting, there are different ways to win and it scales very well. Highly recommended!

Wow, these cards are hard to track. SO MUCH TEXT and not all of it is relevant.  The game isn't really as complicated as the cards make it look, but a lot of it is about making sure that it doesn't end each turn in a way that would make someone else win. (1 play)

RATING: N/A
Este juego con cartas es un producto de la habilidad obsesiva de Phil Eklund para ligar mecánicas con tema y arco narrativo obteniendo el resultado de una experiencia más que jugar a un juego.

Ambientado en México de 1898, los jugadores son hacendados en los estados de Sonora y Chihuahua, cada uno con sus ventajas. Tienen el objetivo de satisfacer las condiciones de victoria esperando derrocar al dictador Porfirio Díaz. Esto se consigue mediante la suma de PV´s (cuatro tipos:ultraje, mando, lealtad y revolución) válidos para cada uno de los cuatro posibles finales del juego (intervención de los USA, golpe de estado, Porfirio nombra a un sucesor, estalla la anarquía revolucionaria).

Esto lo consigues mediante la realización de tres acciones por turno con las que podrás crear empresas (y obtener dinero de ranchos, minas, plantaciones...), explotar empresas ajenas (para obtener dinero y dañar al contrario), adquirir socios (cartas que te dan habilidades especiales), y desplegar tropas que te ayuden en tus negocios.

Junto a todo eso y rebosando tema, puedes nacionalizar empresas (hundiendo negocios completamente), asesinar a un socio (tal y como suena. Propio o ajeno), extender tus propiedades, mejorar métodos de transporte (lo que influirá en el costo de despliegue de tropas que vayan a ese destino) y montones de cositas que no explico por depender del tipo de régimen del juego o del texto de las cartas.

El nucleo de la mecánica consiste en un mercado central formado por 12 cartas en el que las que más tiempo pasan allí, van reduciendo su precio de compra. Adquirir una de ellas costará una de las tres acciones.

Las cartas de "Titular" son las que mantienen la economía funcionando, pero descartar dos seguidas con el símbolo de "oso rojo" ocasionará una depresión económica, algo reversible y previsible, pero muy muy temático.

PROS: Como en todos los juegos del autor, no hay una única forma de ganar, aunque no todas sean evidentes. Muy temático. Es una montaña rusa, al igual que la revolución mexicana. Interactivo, pero de manera compensada. Aunque puedes destruir negocios contrarios, el dueño gana puntos de "ultraje" y le facilita la victoria por "intervención de los USA".

CONS: Un juego que exige más de lo que te entrega. Aunque a escala "macro" el juego es sencillo (sólo hay que hacer tres acciones por turno entre el abanico de posibilidades), no se trata más que un envoltorio de un juego complicado, no es tarea fácil entender las reglas y mucho menos la estrategia para ganar. El poco intuitivo libro de reglas sirve para resolver dudas, pero no para aprender a jugar. Explicarlo es un verdadero dolor de cabeza porque hay excepciones y excepciones dentro de esas excepciones. Cartas saturadas de mucha información. Muy proclive al Análisis Parálisis.

Okay, finally got to play this a second time and...it fell pretty flat for me.  There are a lot of interesting ideas, and I feel like I [i]should[/i] like it given how much of it I like on paper, but in practice the game just drags and isn't terribly engaging.  It seemed like the game devolved into a game of reverse chicken, as people were reluctant to play bad cards on other players to avoid giving them points.

Simply freaking brilliant.  Lots to remember, but it all becomes very natural thanks to the exceptionally tight integration of the rules with the theme.  Brilliant.  Every game since the first few between my opponent and I have come down to the wire.  Someone's always just a hair's width away from victory near the endgame, or sometimes before you know what happened if you don't pay a little attention.

Pascual Orozco, going solo, played a blinder today, with the requisite prestige nicely lined up, an orange flip to Anarchy card in his hand (just gagging to play the straw man) and there, on the board, in the two-cost column, the Anarchy Topple card all ready and waiting. Okay, Diaz, roll away; anything but a five or a nine and you're toast.

Bastardo. 

Honestly, do not know why this game doesn't get more love. Great, great stuff.

This was my first experience with Phil Eklund games and it was great. After a 1.5h long learning curve we started a 3 player session. Gameplay was clear - we understood how to build our economy and most important - how to ruin the same economy of other players. The flavor text and theme this game creates during the play is just amazing.

The only thing that prevent me from giving a higher mark was TOPPLE action. We ended the play with a gold victory and it seemed that in a 3 player session is very hard to topple president Diaz since both your opponents are in tripartite.

I hope to play another game with 4 or 5 players, to experience this aspect of game more in details. And I'm hoping to give a higher mark for this brilliant game.

Pax is a "Take That!" card game with brains.  It's Munchkin with soul and I mean no disrespect by that.  What you have here is a highly varied (207 unique cards) card game rich in theme and vast in strategy.  There's always something to do and further your goals whether it's extort your opponents, run the market dry, sell off your unwanted assets, or even attack yourself (yes, you can attack yourself).  Unfortunately the rules are poorly written but once you wrap your head around the concept you will find a great card game that's highly replayable and rich in theme.

I have been watching Phil since the days when Origins: How we became Human debuted at Essen, which to me still remains a fascinating game, but sadly also one I still have not played as I missed playing it in Germany that year, and then follow up reports gave me enough caution to stop actively seeking it out (I still REALLY want to play it though).  

The thing is like I mentioned below, I love the fact that he takes an “interesting” theme, and then builds the game on it, to me I have always believed this is the way it should be done.  However, I have also always believed that if I am going to invest 2+ hours into a strategy game, I better have enough control over whether or not I can win it rather than it being entirely an "experience" type game.  Well, in my estimation (and it really is “estimation” on my part having not played many of his others) this is the first “game” (rather than simulation also, this is definitely a game) of his that fits that bill, and it’s the reason I bought the game, and after playing as you can tell from my rating am glad I did. (I have no issue with sims, but just thought I would note that for anyone that does) 

So I would say I am somewhat biased here though which could reflect in my rating a tad; I really like variable power card games, engine games, and well implemented strong themed games that allow for wins to still be meaningful (SO many AT games fail on that last point, for me).  I have only played once so far, and I can see where “possibly” card draw luck could be factor, and I am only speculating on that, but either way I don’t think its out of line at all at least as of now, and I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that most of the screwage going around were all fairly small things and that some could even be mitigated.  

I was also surprised at just how easy the game was to learn, we did have the benefit of learning from someone who had played once before (rather than reading the once again poorly done rulebook which I guess makes all the difference), but wow, he barely had to explain anything the game is VERY straightforward actually, and another bonus is that many of the turns can be very fast, pacing was quite good I thought, with 2 new players and learning we finished in 2.5 hours.  Not sure I see the depth others mention it seems more like lateral analysis, it’s a pretty straight forward engine game to me anyway with a great dose of interaction and shifting goals. 

Not to say clever and small devious plans can’t be hatched, they certainly can and there are quite a few things to keep your eye on for sure, with the number getting bigger as more cards get played throughout the game but it is swayed to the tactical side of things to me, over the half cards will NOT be in play and flexibility is important as you never know which carpet will be pulled next which include the 1 of 4 winning conditions.  Here-in lies probably my favourite part of the game, the delicious choices of what levers to pull, and which cards to buy to make sure they don’t get pulled, you really do have some control here, just maybe not quite as much as you would like at any given time keeping the tension and intrigue ramped up...  

Negatives are the amount of reading you need to do (though in 4 player you have time to do it when not your turn, you also have time to plan, just don’t spend too much time planning too far ahead, it’s a dynamic game to be sure) Group think could potentially lengthen games by plotting against those in contention.  I would be interested to play Lords now after this one, likely best with 4 but I will be trying with 2 or 3, 2 likely weakest.  Should stay between 8 and 9 for me unless hidden depths actually appear.  

Update: 8 => 7.5  Two is the weakest number for sure, some of the initial gleen has already wore off which was faster than expected. Due to the open info it is susceptible to group think, where someone notices someone else is too close to winning and all try to figure a way to stop him. I really like Pax, but maybe it is not quite as good as I hoped and a little over-hyped initially, still nice to have another solid and strong-themed card game around at any rate. 

===================

Finally an Eklund I might like? Early reports would seem to indicate, and being a card game might help (Note I almost ALWAYS love the idea behind his games, just not the execution. I still need to play High Frontier, but I think that is also an "experience game" which for me, will mean play it once and probably once only no need to own) I buy games where if its not a party game I have some control over my fate and the game challenges me, not my patience level... 

Definitely need to try this one, like the theme again too (I think I've liked every theme he has done) just hope the chaos can be kept low enough where a win actually MEANS something

After four plays (9): Took about three games to "click" but when it did... wow! Amount of fun to be had is really dependent on the personalities of your group; with the right group of people who know the rules, it's a blast to play though.

Edit 10 Okt. 2016, after ten plays (8,5): adjusting the score slightly down. Although I still think this is a great game, I've noticed that the enjoyment from game to game fluctuates quite a bit. AP is a problem: pick your group wisely. Some Kingmaking-issues as well in two of the ten games I've played. 

But! The moments that everything falls into place (and this happens more often than not) this is a tense, hugely entertaining experience.

I wasn’t prepared for a game so deep. I thought it was a light card game. I should have know better because this is a Eklund game :S. Sadly, in our only play all the players weren’t in the game as there was a lot of noise in the background. This is not a casual game and we tried to play it in a casual gathering with causal players so we left the game unfinished. I need to give it another chance soon.

I had huge hopes for the game, but now I’m not sure  I want to play it again. The theme is boring for me BUT the game theme is felt very strongly during the game (lots of flavor text and the card effects are thematically congruent with the game mechanics). Many friends really like the theme.

The rules aren’t that complicated, but there are a lot of them and each card also has a lot of information, due to this, Pax Porforiana is not a casual game. The game explanation can take more than 30 minutes and the play time can be very quick or very slow.

These days, I don’t enjoy games that feature prominently lots of “take that” and, sadly for me, Pax Porfiriana is one of those games. You must attack the current leader or he will run away the victory. However this game has a plus in that regard, when you attack someone, you gave him more VPs, it still isn’t enough for me to like the game AND many times the VP you gain won’t make a difference to you. The attack will hit the target 95% of the time, that is, there is no easy way to defend yourself (some cards allow for this). It seems to me, the first player who tries to win has it very hard as all the players will try to stop him right away (turning their character card or discarding cards to increase the defense), however the next player who tries it has it much more easy as many resources are already depleted. This “attack the leader” feature, practically guarantees a long play time most of the time. 

Sometimes it is really hard to change the regime, so I think the game has lots of uncontrollable luck/chaos due to the cards. At first I didn’t think that was the case because they all have different prices but now I’m not so sure. Also many cards are very powerful (nationalize all Sonoran corporations comes to mind) so I’m not sure about the game balance.

I really liked that not all the cards are present in every game. Another great point, the game has no obvious decisions and is very deep.

Bottom line, I really (REALLY) wanted to like this game, but I have never had much fun playing it. It is now off of my wish list. I will play again if requested to reevaluate my feelings for the game.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 6.5
I would like to play this game again as I suspect there's a lot to it that I didn't get on the first play, and that playing it with 3, while a fine idea for learning the rules, didn't really give me a fair impression of what it's about.

Specifically, on my first play I didn't really catch the importance of hanging onto a government change that benefits one's own victory position, and hanging onto it until it can be played in conjunction with a Topple card.  So we spent an inordinate effort doing the usual multiplayer-endgame thing where we stopped each other until we ran out of ways to stop the win.  I think with good play a player ought to be able to force the win more easily.

Current rating is 6.5 but 6 is a floor - I could imagine rating this game much higher if more plays reveal subtlety that escaped me on first play.

A lot going on here and definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy extreme player interaction, strong theme and managing chaos and the complexity is an attraction rather than an obstacle, this could be for you.

For those to whom it's suited it's likely to be a great  experience.

Regarding the production values, the cards would have benefitted from being larger as there is a lot of information on them, and illustrations too. The cards make sense once you've got your head round the icons, but being larger would have helped a lot, especially when you're looking around the table to review what the others have in play.

One of the player aids that allow you to track influence points makes keeping tabs on who's doing what a lot easier.

Played solo. Not solo variant though. Great design. I must be a rocket scientist at heart because the rules were pretty easy to grasp. I've had more trouble wrapping my head around VPG rule books. Would be a 10 if it had nicer components (e.g. The colored disc serve a dual purpose - you use the gold disc as unrest disc and vice versa). Second game completely different from the first. 

Original Score 9.5 upgraded to 10 with collectors edition and fancy tokens.

Game is fiddly.  Very much so.  But it's a wild romp where you have to backstab, but properly and not randomly, and there is so much going on it's hard to keep it all straight, and there's the "how the heck did that happen" ending where everyone is staring at the one person with a big grin on their face.

RATING: 9
A remarkable achievement--PaxPo brings a little-known historical period to life in an unbelievably spartan package: just a couple hundred cards, some cubes, and money. 

Although it's challenging to teach, ultimately the play is not too complex and almost every mechanism has an "Ahhh, that makes sense" historical grounding. It needs a few plays before you can grasp the subtleties of timing your push for a win, and the victory condition is definitely out of the ordinary. 

The designer's rule-writing is downright notorious, and this one's no exception. Dozens of what I consider to be rules are squirreled away in the Glossary section (!!!), an abjectly daft decision that confounds new players and even the semi-experienced.

Pax is a wild and wooly beast bursting with a dissertation's worth of research on over 200 cards. Did I also mention it's fun? Seriously, this is a rip-roaring old fashion western tale if there ever was one. 

To quote user MScrivner, Pax is a "ten hour simulation game that has been compressed into a tiny box until all that remains is its hot glowing core. It evokes narrative with every game, even every action. It is complex and unwieldy and impatient and glorious". 

Well there it is. Enthusiastically recommended.

RATING: 8
This really has some strikes against it with the card design and the complexity (for my usual group of gamers), but I really like the frustration and tension of this one.

Good with 2 and 3...we are thinking of having people read their "special" power cards every time a Topple comes up. There's too much going on and there's no really good way to know what your opponent has due to the small text of the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not sure what to think of this after one play. It is a style of game that isn't well suited to my tastes. The chaotic game play and negative player interaction don't appeal to me. Game length is highly variable, however games that are too short or too long don't seem very satisfying. Players are encouraged to throw themselves under the bus to stop someone else from winning, and king making also seems quite common. 

What I do like is the manipulation of victory conditions and careful plotting of which points to collect. That along with keeping a close eye on opponents' intentions make some compelling decisions. However, the bad outweighs the good. I'd like to play it a couple more times to solidify my opinion, but that's where I am at the moment.

This one goes deep. Rating likely to increase. 

Tldr: it's one of Phil's best games. 

The rules are somewhat poorly laid out (tip - read the glossary as those ARE the rules) but the game works thematically, makes sense and is most of all fun!

You try and build your economy through enterprises whilst gathering troops to extort your opponents or protect your own investments. Control the type of regime in play to open up the opportunity to win the game when a topple card comes up.

RATING: 7
My first Eklund game but thanks to the FAQ document and the rules explanation aid here on the geek it was nowhere near as daunting as his games have the reputation to be. No severe rules mistakes as far as I can see on our first play!
As expected, Pax Porfiriana succeeds in providing an experiental game and is true to its theme. Revolutionary troops could be felt rising while us loyalists tried our best to avoid their victory, meanwhile looking for other sneaky ways to follow Porfirio in his rule.
To be honest, gameplay dragged as we spent a lot of time reading and rereading the cards, trying to work out a good use for our three actions with a lot of options around. But there is enough potential for clever plays, that even the strong targeted take-that element doesn't deter me, namely as the target gets compensated by some kind of victory point that might be useful later. My hope is that Pax picks up a lot if I ever manage to put together a group of experienced players. Also, I only tried it with three players which given the unique topple VP conditions isn't the optimal number. With four or five players, no player should be able to focus on a single target and neglect economy providing for a more interesting dimensional frame.

Not my favorite game mechanisms, as there is a lot of take that and sort of random events, but I have to admire the historical flavor of the game. Not knowing anything about the time period it depicts, it makes me want to know more, and that is an impressive feat. I have never played a generic eurogame and wanted to know more about European nobility or goods trading in the Mediterranean. Who knows if the game will have staying power, but for now it is fun.

A great card/tableau game with likeness to an eurogame that attracts somehow wargamers. 

Grow up your "hacendado", undermine your rivals, and try to topple Porfirio. But there's no need to play in this specifical order; that is just one of the greatness of the game. There are a lots of different ways to play it, and different strategies.

Perfect when we are 3 to 5 players, lots of deep play in little time (2 hours with 4 players).

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

Fun and historically evocative, however, there is a scattershot feeling to the card buying. While there is some structure from the player powers or partner cards the history can still seem a little too open-ended and disjointed for my taste. On the other hand, the chaos can be light and fun at times. The Eklund games sometimes seem to treat "handwaving" explanations of theme as a feature ala storytelling games. This does require the players to have some historical knowledge though.

I'm a bit worried that the strawman play is too often the preferred use of orange cards. I suppose it depends on player count, which does change the feel of the game quite a bit due to it's effect on the tripartite scoring system, which also has optional rules.

I think the game suffers from not having interlocking systems, much of the game is just about having discrete benefits from each card. There isn't much cause and effect modeling happening.

RATING: 5
Oozes flavor and offers a lot of replayability. Very tactical and lots of antagonism included. Graphic layout of cards is weak, there's too much happening. Two player game can degenerate into a kind of tug of war, but I wouldn't mind trying this with more players.

I understand what they were trying to do. I think the scoring mechanism is clever and interesting, but a game this long, where your options are so dependent on the card draw, does not do it justice.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I enjoy tableau building and cards with multiple uses so this was right up my alley! One never knows what the distribution of cards will look like in a given game keeping each game fresh. Game is quite thematic with quite a bit of history on the cards as well. This is not for the faint of heart as your properties will get stolen, reduced in value, removed, etc.

I had heard a lot of good things about this one, but I was wary as I wasn't sure it would be something I could get into. It's a busy game, with a lot going on and a lot of thematic chrome, but ultimately tense and brutal. We had an odd card distribution (very few troops) which tilted the game into a more economic angle. With the vast pool of cards to draw from, it seems like it would be very different each time. The player roles seem way out of whack. My ability to buy black cards for free was far and away better than another player's 3 extra starting cash. I know theme and accuracy is more important to Eklund than rigid balance, but that seemed way off. It's probable, however, that there are some subtle balancing things going on that I'm not yet aware of. Truth be told, it reminds me a lot of The New Era, a game I'm the official flag-carrier for, so it lived up to the hype for me.

For an Eklund game, the game is remarkably straightforward. This is not to say that it's simple in any way shape or form. There's a lot going on, a lot to keep track of, and a lot to think about. 

Also, the rules suffer from being not as concise and to the point as they ought to be. The glossary is a must, and it would have been really useful to have the card summaries on a handout rather than on the side of the box.

One of the more complex card games I have played.  It is a pretty good simulation of the complex political environment in Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th century.  You are buying cards and putting lands out that give you abilities and help you economy and possibly hurt your opponents.  There are topple cards that come out that provide opportunities to win if you have right combination of cards.  

It is hard to teach and learn, but it seems to be worth the investment.  I liked the game and found it fun.  It is hard to get Phil Eklund games to the table though unless you have other players out there who like these heavy games.

Terrific cutthroat game.  Let me emphasize the fact that it is really cutthroat, no doubt about it, if you like building things you will hate it because bullies will kick down your sand castles over and over again (and you'll do the same).  Great replayability built in the game, no two matches are exactly the same thanks to the way the deck is built.  The theme and production values are excellent.  The board with the collector's edition is very handy as you learn the game and to easily see what the options are (cost of cards).  Reasonable length when playing two player (about 60 mins).  Got to play it with someone who understands and accepts that it is a ruthless, take that, no holds barred, competitive, scorched earth game and was ready to play again after the first match.  Not as much fun if you are tired, if you are not sharp you will have a hard time keeping track of all that is going on at once.  Wrong kind of game if you have too many players, perfectionists, control freaks, or AP prone players, great fun with the right crowd.

Edit: Last week I've played with two guys and it was almost impossible to teach the game in one session. TOO many options. My friends and me were enthusiast about the game though. So we agree to give it a second chance 

Edit: Yesterday we gave the second chance to the game. My friends understood how to play the game now. However, we still have to learn a lot of strategy. I liked the game, but it was not awesome. I found it a little slow (maybe because we were knowing the cards), but next time will be faster I think. We agree to give it a third chance. I keep score 7.

 A lot of play in a small package. Once you get your head wrapped around the mechanics, you can move onto figuring out what to do and how to win - and there are many different paths to winning. Try to dominate one of the four types of government, or stretch the game out for an economic win. 

The game has a LOT of variability. In a given game, you'll use only 70-100 out of a possible 200 randomly chosen cards. Each card has some historical flavor text as well, so you'll learn something along the way. 

Learned this at a con and proceeded to play it five times in four days. Each time we had new and different players joining in and everyone had a blast. 

This game is not as dense or as much a brain burner as say Origins or High Frontier. Once you get the hang of it, things can move fast and you'll be done in 60-90 minutes. That being said, it is not a simple game, and there are many things to keep track of and you must be flexible.

RATING: 9
Fun, exciting, entertaining game. Doesn't exactly play like a Knizia game, however; lots of indie vibe here, even though it seems very well playtested.

The game has a similar footprint as Race for the Galaxy, so not at all the convoluted brain burner than some here will lead you to believe.

The rules are a little verbose, but functional and complete. They are organized in a somewhat odd way, not totally unlike the three part rules of the early Settlers of Catan. As in Settlers, where rules where split between a quick-start sheet, a short summary, and a glossary, you have to remember to read from cover to cover eventually; the glossary is part of the rules.

The gameplay is streamlined and intuitive once you get over the initial hump of having someone explain the victory conditions, the game narrative, etc., which takes 20 min. Then again, I am not able to teach RftG any faster. After that, everything just hums along.

I think whether you like the graphic design on the cards ultimately comes down to taste; everything is functional and professionally done. Someone would have to take a Mike-Doyle-like approach and completely destruct the old design to improve them in my opinion.

After a few plays you recognize the types of cards and know what information to look for. I´ll be happy to play again with 3 or 4.

Plays better with: point tracks, found here on BGG.

Played 5-10 times.

Less excited after second game, but I´m still looking forward to exploring this. Luck of the draw is a factor - or rather, luck of the cards you need being in the deck at all. Probably better with 3 than 4. Still, even with 4 it´s easy to see all the cards in front of the other players.

Definitely unlike euros, it is hard to have a grand strategy, nor does the game allow you to gradually build foundation towards your success.

-Much randomness in solitaire game (and potentially in multiplayer game, I have not tried).
-Many cards make no (or little) sense to play in solitaire game.

Note: Rating is for solitaire game. It seems like this might be a better game with multiple players, maybe 3 or 4. I am still somewhat concerned about the randomness though.

There is a lot of chrome which makes it difficult to keep track of everything, but also adds to the thematic flavor.

It seems like playing for a victory on $ is the way to go.

In the end, it's a game I would enjoy playing occasionally.  I will happily play it when it is requested, but I am not likely to request it.

Best card game in my collection.  It tells a real story and tells it well. When I'm playing I can't believe it's just cards.  All the information is open.  Pure strategy.  Great, great game.

Edit: bought the collector's edition for the big box and the board for this and Pax Pamir, and it's a great buy. I actually am keeping the entire Pax Pamir box in this CE box. Also, the Pax Porfiriana cards seem even nicer than in the original edition - just seem slightly better quality. Also, the rulebook is considrably improved, notably with plenty of color illustrations of the cards in play examples or just descriptions. I think this is so helpful in a game with so many types of cards. The original rulebook was actually pretty good as a reference, but wasn't the easiest guide for newbies trying to learn the game. Kudos to all involved. Either version, this is one of the best buys in gaming, for people who are up for the complexity. 

I did not play this until 2013, but it is easily my favorite game of the year. Fairly simple gameplay at the macro scale (take three actions on your turn, here are the actions you may take), but leads to very complex and satisfying gameplay. I have only played a couple of times, cannot wait to play more. I also love the cards themselves, some of the most beautiful and thematic cards I've seen in a game. And I love the historical detail on the cards -- just a model on how to blend theme into a multiplayer game. Kudos, Sierra Madre Games.

Brilliant little gem, but very Ecklund: the cards take a good 20 minutes of staring until they make sense, and has enough weird rules on the side to throw anyone the first few games.

RATING: 9
Rating based on single solo play, can see it moving up a bit in group play, and down a bit in solo play once I have a better sense of the luck-to-skill ratio over more plays.  

Update: Played a few more solo games. Luck definitely plays a role in solo-play, but that's actually what's compelling and at the crux of the tactical gameplay. I'm sure there's even more nuance in regards to this in multiplayer games. Being flexible and capitalizing on the information that is in front of you and the actions of your opponents. Excited to try out the solo bot (and multiplayer as well obviously).

Update: A lot more multiplayer games.  Bumped up into the top of my games

Lords of the Sierra Madre stripped down to the raw elements.  I like this one very much.  The whim of the cards (you use less than half the deck) can screw you so you have to adapt to the situation.  Quite a few ways to try and win, allowing some screwage and some clever plays.  Because of the vast number of cards, should be quite different each play.  Awesome as a learning device: I discovered so much history in such a little box.

We've only played twice so it's probably us not having got the strategy yet, but we keep using all attack cards on ourselves to score prestige points. But nevertheless a fantastic experience and I'm looking forward to many more plays.

This is one that I will forever have mixed feelings about. It's a very unique experience and the level of historical chrome makes it special. However, I'm not sure it's any fun to play. I'm enjoying Pamir so much I have a hard time imagining when I'll play Porfiriana again. Having said that, I don't think I want to part with it either. Maybe someone can talk me into playing this one another time.

Update: Though I'd still rather play Pamir, I've started to come around on Porfiriana. In fact, I think it's safe to say that my many plays of Pamir led me to appreciate Porfiriana more. Porf is definitely chaotic but it provides a lot of interesting narrative as well as meaningful decision points. It's also a lot more tolerable when everyone has some experience with the system and the rules grind lessens.

Love, love, love this game! For a little card game, this one is filled to the brim. It's absolutely dripping with theme, player interaction, resource management, and backstabbing. Rating dropped from 10 due to the extreme viciousness of the 2-player game. Otherwise, can't wait for the next one!

RATING: 10
Love it--this is really one of the best games to surface in a long while. The 200+ cards are fascinatingly rich and varied, and the fact that less than half of them are utilized in any one sitting not only makes the game endlessly replayable but also neatly avoids the kind of unrealistic augury inherent in many card-driven games (only the four topple opportunities are certain to appear). It's also great the way the market tableau eliminates the need for constant auctioning--a mechanic that in my view mars all of the original [i]Lords[/i] games--and consequently speeds up play considerably.

I am already a-drool at the thought of [i]Lords of the Renaissance[/i] and [i]Lords of the Spanish Main[/i] getting the same treatment. [11 plays]

RATING: 9
This one is typical of a Phil Ekland design - an arcane rulebook, cards crowded with so much info it's hard to parse what is and isn't relevant details for actual play, mechanics that have exceptions and exceptions to exceptions, turn-to-turn game play that is crammed with an overwhelming number of choices, some of which the results or consequences are not immediately apparent, and overall, a headache inducing amount of stuff to do, think about, try, consider, plan for, react to, and overcome. While that would seem like a detriment, in fact the result is this is one of the most narrative rich game experiences I've ever played--dense with story, replete with history and culture and flavor, the dirty sweat of theme dripping from every pore. This game is a masterpiece, a joy, a surprise and a delight--while other card games are simply mediums for the interaction of mechanics, this card game is a medium for the exploration of history and human nature. And in that category, it's got everything - greed, political corruption, dirty-dealing, cruelty, violence and war, social unrest, upheaval, and revolution. I look forward to playing it again.

Surprisingly game-like for a Phil Eklund game. There seemed to be tactics involved, maybe even *gasp* some strategy! VERY overwhelming based on just one play. I basically didn't have any idea what I should do. The garbled and tex-heavy visual style doesn't help a bit, especially since the theme in this one didn't do anything for me. Looks cheap, of all the Sierra Madre games I've played this one felt the most like playing a prototype.

A solid, well-designed game that really helps educate its players on the history of Northern Mexico during the turn of the 20th century. That being said, I'm not sure how much fun I had with this game. Everything works well enough, and I like how seamlessly regimes are shifting in and out, but I don't know that this is a keeper for me. It reminds me a lot of Doomtown: Reloaded in that it's kind of a dudes on a map game using cards. I think the game is great for those who can appreciate the theme, but the game itself is a little bit more of a chore than an engaging experience, which is typical of Phil Eklund designs.

This card game simulates early 20th century Mexico. Players are drafting cards from 6 rows. The first row, cards cost nothing, the next row costs one, the next row costs two, etc. Cards range from income generating cards like mines or ranches, to personalities, to soldiers to extort money, to general purpose cards. Cards played advance players in one of four areas: command, loyalty, outrage and revolution. Seeded in the deck are 4 "topple" cards, where a player may attempt to win the game by overthrowing the current government. Depending on the number of players, your particular attribute you are trying to topple in has to exceed the government plus that of the weakest player(s).

It's an interesting game. Our first game took the whole afternoon, but it is engaging. I'd like to play a couple more times to get a better feel for the game. Now there are cards in the game to eliminate other people's stuff, but they come with a certain cost, so it is not entirely conflict free. 

There are some interesting elements in this game, but it can be confusing when you attempt a topple as you don't know the current regime. It's a bit chaotic, par for the course for a Phil Eklund game, and those who enjoy his designs will like this one, but I'm not a huge fan of this design. I've decided that it isn't quite worth the investment in time, due to the chaos and the cards themselves aren't clear on what you can do.

[ImageID=247533micro][/floatleft][b]Pax Porfiriana[/b] designed by [person=174][/person], [person=2085][/person], and [person=67124][/person] 

Reimplements [thing=284][/thing]. 

Boardgame for 1 to 6 players (recommended 2-5 players) vying for power and empire in revolutionary Mexico, 1898-1920. Win if you become the next dictator of Mexico.

Pax Porfiriana - latin for "The Porfirian Peace" – refers to the 33-year reign of dictator Porfirio Díaz, who ruled Mexico with an iron hand until toppled by the 1910 Revolution.

In the turbulent pre-revolutionary borderlands of the U.S. and Mexico, players compete to build business empires of ranches, mines, rails, troops, and banks while subverting opponents with bandidos, Indians, and lawsuits.

Update:
A Collector´s Edition with a 2-sided game board (for Pax Porfiriana and Pax Pamir) will be coming out in October 2015. Pre-orders possible at http://sierra-madre-games.eu/

At Spiel 2015 publisher Phil Eklund says that he'll have a prototype copy of Pax Renaissance on hand for previewing ahead of its release in October 2016.

[b]Collector's edition errata (Nov 2015):[/b]

1)
• Improve Connection. If an Enterprise has a Connection icon (a boot, burro, train, or boat), you can perform the “upgrade connection action” and pay to place [b]a cube [/b]there. Building this not only earns income, but now Troops being deployed to the Enterprise can (and must!) use the new and improved Connection. 

2)
(3) Sacking. If the destination is an enterprise with no [b]Income or Extortion[/b] cubes, it is Sacked (i.e. discarded, see glossary). 

3)
• Player Assassination. During your “topple showdown round” (K2), you may play any Assassination from your hand to kill a flipped Hacendado.  This flips your victim’s card permanently back to its “Loyalist” side (representing his son or heir, once again with 2 income [b]and special ability[/b]). The cost is 3 gold plus 3 gold for each troop in the victim's Private Army. The assassin is Victim-Awarded, and the Private Army (if any) is discarded.

4)
Grudge Pile– Cards that are Victim-Awarded to you are stored in this stack, stored to the right of your Hacendado. Store these cards oriented 180° so that the Prestige Point reads right side up.  They represent “grudges”, an accumulation of all the dirty-dealings against you. Other players can examine your grudges. The Prestige Points on each Grudge Card are active (e.g. for Prestige Cubes and during Topples and other Headlines), but[b] the card is[/b] otherwise not In Play and can’t be used. 

5)
Slave Revolt – If an enterprise depicts a Revolution Point (upside-down), it employs Yaqui slave labor.  These slaves can be liberated if the enterprise suffers Unrest or loses Income, such as if targeted by orange cards, troops, or Headlines.    As noted on the card, if you cause the Unrest on a slave enterprise to be greater than its number of cubes (either by decreasing its Income, Connection, Prestige, or Extortion Cubes, or by increasing its Unrest), you become the Liberator.  Furthermore, several rebel (Yaqui) troops automatically cause a Slave Revolt if used to extort a slave enterprise. In either case, the enterprise card is Victim-Awarded to the Liberator as a Revolution Point, stored in his Grudge Pile. If a Slave Revolt occurs [b]as a result of[/b] a Depression, then the enterprise is discarded without a Liberator.

Mostly 1p - The included solo rules are great, although Ricky Royal's take it up a notch.
Solo gameplay is quick and enjoyable, with Diaz's turn going quickly to keep your focus on your own tableau.  It's a battle to achieve a win, and rewarding when done.

I've got a few 2-3p games under my belt now, and wow does it ever come alive with real opponents!  Gameplay is a breeze, getting easier as everyone gains familiarity with the standard mechanisms in play.  And getting past the straight mechanical gameplay, the flavour text is simply mindblowing!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really like the posturing/maneuvering that seems to be the core of what the game wants to do.  The actual time spent playing though isn't on that, for the most part.  It's on counting up what everyone has, and what they could have, and what they want to have, etc.  That part is both rotely mechanical, and onerous.  The "right" interface for this game, in my mind, whether electronic or cardboard, tracks not only the prestige points each player has, but what they could have if they took the actions available to them during a topple, and what they could do from hand.  It'd tell me outright what each player could get off the board given the cash on hand and their 2 or 3 action limit.

Core to the game, but purely a time-sink in terms of "playing".

Great game held back by exceptionally fiddly rules that take WAY too long to teach, graphic design that is exceptionally busy making it hard to parse from across the table, and gameplay that can induce AP in most anyone.

Pax is pure gold! A lot of 'take that' in this game, which could turn some people off, but I enjoy that aspect of the game. Also, keep in mind that when you're attacking someone you are likely giving them much needed victory points. Great concept and great game play. I love it...

Many complaints about the graphic design - It is busy, but once I understood the game I enjoyed the graphic design.

The rulebook is not intuitive and I needed to watch some tutorials on BGG to get the flow of the game down. However, a lot of the rules are in the glossary in which I found helpful in answering in-game questions.

I would venture to say that this game would have won the Golden Geek Best Card Game of 2013 if it were more accessible.

RATING: 6
I only played it once, and this game definitely needs more plays, but I feel I have a good grasp of the general feeling already. Overall, it makes me happy to have so many interesting cards, with such historical meaning. Very well researched, it seems. The problem, for me, is that you don't feel you're going forward that much during the game, as your opponents can crash your whole engine quite easily - and you can also crash theirs. It's a fair game, usually, but some luck in the drawing may heavily affect the outcomes, which is not a great thing for such a long game. I'm very willing to play it again, though.

The worst thing? The total lack of a decent graphic design in the game. Nothing is correctly aligned, the colour pallete is laughable, and even the size and shape of the graphic elements is awful. And I'm not a design guy. Please, hire a better designer and remake this game. It definitely deserves it.

A nice design held back by slightly-lacking production values (no board... really?).  I suspect my rating will probably rise.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]My buddy Jack who owns this also has the other Pax games, so I think I'll be play Pax Renn. next. I'd still like to take another shot at Pax Porfiriana, but I would need a complete rules refresh at this point. My one complaint of Pax would be just how obtuse the rules are, which makes playing this again a daunting task. I also wouldn't be willing to deal with the "living" rule set which is constantly evolving. The Pax games have a high barrier to entry, but if you know someone who is invested in them then they are worth seeking out to play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Wow, what a crazy game, I can't even begin to describe it. Thankfully I had an excellent teacher (thanks Jack) who was able to teach the overall rules/flow of the game without bogging down with too many specifics. I played in a 4p game and had a blast even though I got crushed, in fact Jack won on the first topple but it was enough to make me want to play again. I really can'r say much else except if you're interested in playing try and find someone who already knows the game to teach you, I can't imagine trying to learn this game from the rule book.[/i]

Algo me debo estar perdiendo, porque a pesar de las buenas críticas que tiene el juego, no encuentro el "efecto Eklund" que me atrae de sus diseños. Pax tiene el emblemático enfoque realista, con su cuidado detalle que desarticula la estética y la miríada de excepciones temáticas en las reglas. Eso lo esperaba y no me molesta, al contrario. También tiene esa importante demanda de planificar y administrar opciones, sabiendo que el azar puede desbaratar hasta los planes más conservadores, por alguna razón absolutamente válida en el escenario real que el juego busca representar. Ese azar inclemente, en High Frontier o Bios, donde el peor enemigo es la propia naturaleza, está representado por las mecánicas de administración en el tablero, y tiene algo de impersonal. El mismo juego es tu oponente más duro. En Pax el conflicto es social, y consistentemente, la inclemencia es provocada por los otros jugadores. Pero ya no hay un juego-oponente que derrotar. Los elementos temáticos vuelven a ser variables antisépticas, el escenario pierde rápidamente la consistencia con lo real y se siente mucho más parecido a cualquiera de todos los miles de trash que hay en el mercado.

Tendré que jugarlo más, pero no parece un Eklund.
Debe ser por eso que es tan popular! :D

RATING: 9
Three plays. This game is a brilliant, thematic stew of money management, amassing 'victory' points of four different types and watching out for what your opponents are up to.

The potential for forcing others into unpalatable decisions is high, as is the potential for making devious, Macchiavellian moves.

Sets itself apart from other games with a high 'take that' element by usually awarding the victim victory points of one type or another, thus keeping one player from being exclusively targeted. The golden rule, though, is this: Don't get too attached to your holdings, they are likely more fluid than you think.

Unless you play with open hands, as most do on yucata.de (where the online implementation resides), players with superior powers of memory will have an advantage in this game. Strictly speaking, there's no hidden information, as all cards are acquired from an open market. If there's one thing I'd change about this otherwise brilliant game, it's the lack of true hidden information. Something along the lines of COIN's deception markers would add an intriguing element: players would randomly draw a marker or card that might - only might - give there some extra advantage when played. For instance, +1 outrage point if you already have at least 1, or you own a mine in Mexico, etc.

It's your standard card effect game model. Buy cards, place them in your tableau, earn income, use income to buy more cards. Add a dose of attack/defense cards that can be played against income cards, and a dose of take-that cards. Where it starts to add value is that at any time one of four regimes will be in charge of the land, which will dictate which of the 4 victory points you'll need to win the game when a wertung card is triggered. To win you need to have more victory points in the regime's scoring category than the lowest two players in that category, plus two. Which ain't that easy. So having cards in your hand that allow you to switch to your preferred category as and when needed is handy. Most likely, there won't be an outright winner, in which case the game is decided by most gold after all 4 wertungs have triggered - which means deciding when to stop investing in your engine. On the neat side, the take-that cards give the victim a victory point. The cards are richly themed, almost overwhelmingly so given the convoluted graphic design (which you need to learn to overcome during the first game). There's lots of effects and lots of dependencies, especially on what you can/can't attack/defend/hit, so the first game is pretty slow unfortunately - too slow for what it ends up offering. It's also a game of slow accumulation, so you want to go in knowing you're in for a longer haul than most card effect type games, and getting stuck into the theme will probably help in that regard. Replay is helped by only having half the available deck in play in any one game, and of course in how it reveals itself. It was an interesting game for the experience, and I'd play again to see if it grew, but it was just too slow for starters.

This game is a hoot. A card game that is dripping with theme and is, above all, FUN! I wish the cards had been better formatted like the sequel game Pax Pamir but that becomes a non-issue after a few turns. As with all of Phil Eklund's games that I have played, my first few games were more like "uh, what happens if I do this?" rather than a feeling of confidence about what I was doing. However, this is a game that rewards repeated plays and the strategies eventually emerge. A winner.

A different sort of game about revolution in Mexico.  It's strength is that it has multiple paths to victory and each game plays out differently.  There are elements of the game that I still had trouble with after three plays, but it seems like a good 5 player game.

This game has a lot of potential, but you’ll need the right group for it to shine. I can seem quite complicated because all the cards are unique and some have a lot of text. The messy card design can make reading the cards pretty tough as well. Once you get passed that though there is a lot of game in a little box and a ton of variation because you only use a small selection of the overall deck in each game.

I like theme and find the toppling mechanic great fun, if a little hard to explain to new players. It can be a bit in your face as people can take cards out of your tableau and even steal them in some cases. This can lead to some great moments like someone stealing your partner and the next turn you have them assassinated!

I really enjoyed the historical aspects of this game, but the gameplay didn't really come through for me.  Basically, you amass cards that give you different types of points in anticipation of a "topple" card coming out.  You can see the topple cards coming, so when one is revealed, all the players try to make sure that none of the other players can win.  While some might enjoy that type of dynamic, to me is seems obstructionist.  Also, the art is very busy on the cards, making it very difficult to tell what is going on, which can be problematic since you really need to know what your opponents are up to.

A TON of stuff to pay attention to. Almost overwhelming for our first play. I get the flow of the game now, but it was a very slow start to the game. One that needs to be played over and over. I really like the flavor text and how the cards look, but they do appear to be rather busy.

Update: This game isn't nearly as complex as it first appeared. I REALLY really like it, but I do think that it will become more fun with more players. A lot of little nuances, but nothing too crazy. I can't wait to play this more.

Fantastic card game, somewhat reminiscent in feel to Innovation (an all time favorite of mine). Have played three 3p games and a half-dozen solo. Tons of interaction and huge card abilities can lead to big turns and unexpected game-state shifts (though it's the type of game where the unexpected is expected). Since you only use a fraction of the deck each game, and there is such a huge variety of cards, games play dramatically different from another. Pax is full of theme and history and fun game mechanisms. With more plays and experience I predict this rating will rise.

My first play of a Phil Eklund game. I wasn't sure what to expect, but several members of my gaming group rave about this constantly. In the end, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I was nervous that it would be more of a simulation than a game, based on reports of other Eklund titles. In Pax, each player is attempting to maneouver into a position to seize control when the government is toppled. The shifting victory conditions and the odd calculation of points made it very difficult to anticipate the end-game. This is certainly a game that will reward repeated play. While I'm willing to try it again, I won't be requesting it.

This is what happens when you don't care about anything but the **spirit** of the game. You make something that is chaotic, garish, complex, maddening and beautiful. None of the parts make sense, but the whole is a masterpiece. Like descending into a cellar where a madman lived for 40 years. You don't know why anything is the way it is, but if you spend enough time there you see the coherency rise out of the chaos and shine through. Like a light in the darkness, a cloud of debris that if you walk around and look at it from the right side it is the Mona Lisa grinning at you. I taste the dust of the prisons and the sting of the rebel arrows, the backstabbing of political back alleys and the bluster of the US intervention. The tang of the mine. The sear of raw gunpowder and the hide of the bribes. And the magnificent mustaches. Fuck, this stuff really happened. And now I get a taste. Thank you Phil, I don't know how you do this stuff with a pile of cards and silly tiddly winks man. It is true magick.

I've been interested in Phil Eklund's designs for their seemingly rich informative experiences that they provide, but well aware the rulesets and gameplay are often difficult hurdles to overcome, as well as long playing times. 

However, his recent releases (Greenland onwards) have been praised for being a lot tighter with more engaging gameplay. On Yucata, I finally got to experience my first 'Eklund' and he has piqued my interest in the events outlined in Pax Porfiriana, but it will probably only be a solo venture as it is too much take-that to be palatable at home.

However I am now more interested in his other solo, shorter playing designs, possibly first up will be Bios: Genesis.

Phil Eklund has always promised to make a game that marries his near-obsessive attention to thematic detail and narrative with mechanics that work as a game and not just an experience. I think this time he's pulled it off. 

Pax is a card-drafting and tableau-building game, but with much more interaction than that usually implies. You can play cards and markers straight into your opponents' tableaus, and draft cards with hefty take-that effects. Learning it with two players was a good idea, but it comes into its own with more. The game brilliantly evokes the ferment of its historical setting by forcing the players to keep each other in check and watch for opportunities to seize power unexpectedly. The thematic detail represented on the 200+ unique cards is astonishing and the game is full of Machiavellian plays like attacking your own mines with natives to generate enough outrage to justify a US intervention.

I'm in the first foothills of the learning curve after five plays, but I haven't been this excited about getting to know a game for quite some time.

UPDATE closing in on 20 plays and can't stop thinking and writing about it. I'm going to go ahead and make it a 10.

Played at GameStorm 2017. It took me half the game to figure out the rules through some trial and error, but once I got the hang of it, I left the game feeling like I really needed to play it a second time now that I get the mechanism. There are some things going on in this game that are unique and so it takes some extra effort to grok what it going on. Historical theme was strong, and I was a bit surprised by the amount of "take that" going on. I want to play this game again.

It's a "tableau building" card game (which is a Euro economic engine in card game form). Unfortunately, I don't like these kinds of games. I naively had high hopes for this one because I found the theme intriguing, and the game has a very small footprint compared to games in the same genre (games like Race for the Galaxy and San Juan include cardboard bits that I cynically believe that the publisher added to the game to justify the larger box).

We only played 1/4 of a three-player game; we were all new to the game and tried to learn the game on-the-spot. One player fully did not understand how to quickly create income and requested that we end the game early. Both players, though, thought the game was moving too slowly because we had to constantly pause to figure out what to do with each card. They would play again, but only with the owner of the game (who of course wasn't playing with us but is a huge fan of the game). I blame this on the poor organization of the rules; they hide the fact that this is truly a straightforward game to play. The rules reader has to constantly refer to the glossary for essential rules not explained elsewhere. My opponents assumed that all they needed to know how to play were what actions were available to them. Unfortunately (unlike many Euro games), all cards interact with each other; they don't interact with each other in a linear, assembly-line manner. It would have been much more useful to integrate the rules in the glossary into the sections in the rules where they would make the most sense.

In short, make sure you play with dedicated gamers during your first play of this game. Only introduce this game to more casual gamers if you could explain the rules without looking at them.

In most tableau building games, interaction is minimal. Typical forms of interaction include:

* Rewarding players that predict what their opponent's plan to do: This game does it through a speculation action -- a player can place one of his or her cubes on a card available for purchase. If another player purchases that card, the money spent does not go to the bank but to the owner of the cube.

* Some controlled way of obtaining cards: In this case, it's card drafting

I don't care much for these kinds of interactions. I also don't care much for all the take-that cards in the game. There are also other subtle interactions that enable players to both symbiotically and parasitically feed on each other. This I'm indifferent to. However, I do like the ability of players to make game conditions awful for all players. A player who can manage to trigger these situations when prepared for it -- and everyone else not -- can gain a huge advantage.

For those who like tableau building games, this game is well worth trying. The integration of theme is probably the best of games in this genre. However, because I'm not a fan of these games, the unique elements of this game cannot sway me to try this again.

RATING: N/A
Completely unsure how to rate this one. I'm a fan of tableau builders, and like the semi-controlled chaos of the game (which reminds me a bit of Innovation, where the game can turn on it's head at any moment).  I've even come to like the graphical design, which looks completely bonkers at first.  But it's a game I like playing simply for the experience of playing it, and history tells me that I tend to get burned out or move on from such games quite quickly.

One of the more original games I own. Always wanted to play an Eklund game, but wanted it to be relatively playable. Played three times now in a couple of weeks, all with three players. 

Really interesting, if not overly elegant, game. Theme is super strong (I'm half way through reading the flavour text), but still figuring out strategy. I like the economic avenue, but have been stiffed doing so (a good thing, it's not a satisfying way to win). Gets you thinking a good while after finishing each game - I think you need to set up a half decent economic engine, look at one of the four prestige you lead in and then go all out for that prestige. 

Terrible game to learn, but not too difficult to play. We didn't need the rulebook after the second play. I really like the graphic design, adds nicely to the theme even if a bit difficult to read opponent's cards. Unsure if the 200 playing cards is overkill? Also need to be played in under two hours or starts to feel TOO long. Looking forward to repeat plays. You also need to download some player aids such as a play mat and rules summary.

Picked up in Hanover, On. at Giddy Goblin Games, whilst taking an extended turn at the wheel of the car.

You're a business man. Buy into ranches, banks, etc. Make money, hire soldiers, bide your time, then stomp on Diaz.  

Excellent game of screwage. Particularly notice when you can screw yourself to get points. 

Some times the game hangs, then the game has to end by burrowing through the deck by buying Market cards, yawn, then most gold wins. If it wasn't for that, I'd rate the game higher!

Very interesting game - my sense is that Pax will reward the investment of several initial games of confusion required to get the game to CLICK (hopefully the rest of the guys in my group will agree).

This will be a game that should improve with familiarity with the totality of the 220 card deck.  But in any game only a subset is used, so it may take a few plays. This might leave some to feel the game is "too random" and/or "too fickle" as the cards in play change every time and desired cards might not be in play at all. Like any card driven game, one can have a strategy but will be forced to play tactically with the opportunities present on one's turn.   While the rules might seem intimidating, the basics can be explained quickly and details added as they come up due to the open nature of all the information in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Possibly my favorite game. Very rich narrative can develop if you don't let yourself focus solely on victory points and maximizing profits. 

New players tend to focus on building up their economy through their various enterprises. But then become stunned when their big advantage in money becomes irrelevant when someone topples Diaz on the 2nd or 3rd topple card. 

The game is not for the faint of heart, though. If you don't like the possibility of another player ruining everything you've built with the play of a single card, then this game ain't for you. 

As with most Phil Eklund games, there are many paths to victory, and not all will be immediately evident. The game rewards players that are flexible and can recognize opportunities as they arise--and that can recognize the potential power of certain cards, which have no immediate value.

Pax Porfiriana is simply a fantastic card game. There are a few minor flaws, but overall the game is just brilliant.

There is one very minor negative point I will state right from the start. The subject matter of this game is dull. This game is based around a small time period in Mexican history where the nation changed long standing leadership. Honestly, I could not care less about Mexican history. Very dull.

But, that theme and time period fit this game perfectly. The theme, time period and actual historic events are built into the game and effect every aspect of it. The theme fits so wonderfully that you will want to learn the true Mexican history.

Basically, Pax Porfiriana is an action point allowance game within a card drafting mechanic. Players are allowed three actions each turn to do whatever actions they wish. Mainly that means drafting cards to use for later actions. Added to that is a complex mix of economics, politics and a little bit of war game.

I really like the design of the game. The drafting of cards is handled through a simple economy by buying cards from a collective pool, or Market. Several different types of cards can be purchased and it is those different card types that make the game so much fun to play. The various cards will help you: grow your economy, defend yourself, attack enemies and alter the game flow and conditions.

The different types of cards also offer players many different strategic play styles and offer extremely deep game play. 

As the cards in the Market change, so does the game. The game is in constant flux. Ever changing. Even the end game and winning conditions are constantly changing. To me this feels very much like how Mexico probably actually was during that time period. A lot of uncertainty and chaos as the nation grew from one leader to the next.

However, through the constant chaos and change the game remains very controllable and that is what makes this game great. This is an extremely complex game, yet it remains very playable and easy to follow.

Learning the game from the rules will be difficult. The rules are not poorly written, they just lack that certain flow that really good rulebooks have. Plus, there is a ton of information to cover. I read the rules. Then I watched a video on how to play. Then I read the rules again. At that point I finally learned how to play. Even then during my first game I had to constantly consult the rules and still got several things wrong.

The game is complex and deep. It will take a while to get into the game, but it is well worth the effort. Once you are fully into the game and start seeing the deeper strategies and complexities of the game you will understand why you put the effort into it.

The artwork on the cards is nice. It feels Mexican. At first glance the artwork on the cards looks busy and cluttered. But each card has to hold a bunch of pertinent information. Once you know the anatomy of the cards and what it all means the cards become elegant and well designed.

The money is cheap chips. This is the single downfall of the game. But it is really hard to hold this single shortcoming against such a fabulous game.

Pax Porfiriana is currently out of print and difficult to acquire. Normally this means the game will be massively expansive. While the game is priced somewhat high, it is worth the entrance fee.

--Dec2012-- Lovely period colour combined with some Eklundian political rants.  And then a lovely, subtle, volatile game layered on top.  Yeah: there's quite a lot of randomness here.  One's not always going to have a viable path forward.  So even the most compelling win isn't entirely one's fault.  But the journey toward the win (or loss) is entirely worth it:  the game tells a great story, and allows one to participate sufficiently in the resolution to make the game compelling.

The game play is very interesting.  Lots of tough decisions.  The game is also full of history and gives a good feel for the time period it represents.

It's about half as complex again as Innovation to get your head around the first play, but the reward is well worth it. Even if the theme isn't up your alley you might get drawn into it and end up enjoying learning about this period of Mexican history. I could see the game being used as a pedagogic tool and welcome more games of this ilk.

The choices are amazing. It's never dull. If you're playing with more than two you'll want to play with people than understand and can accept that they'll be hit by other players from time to time. There's plenty of interaction. Once you've got the rules down it plays really fast - really fast with experienced no nonsense players. We can bash out a game in about an hour with four.

A very enjoyable game. It reminds me of several games - the usual card games with depth - Through the Ages and Innovation, however mostly of the feel of Friesematenten, but where the auctions have been replaced by some greatly more satisfying mechanics, the chaos toned down a bit and the theme developed into something historically interesting and less flippant.

--------------------------------

Update - I'm enjoying this immensely online and face to face. The sheer number of cards and resulting variety each game really gives this one legs. The only issue is playing it with people online who are either inexperienced or unobservant. One player can easily gift the game to another (say, by not flipping their Haciendo on a topple attempt), and boom the game is over. The result is that I only want to play this online with players who really know what they're doing. Not trying to be a snob, but it's just pointless otherwise. Face to face there's a little wiggle room for suggestions and so I'm usually happy to play or teach.

Pax P is an interesting animal. Superb history and flavor. Unique mechanisms. It's fun to play. Even the clip-art explosion graphic design has grown on me (though similar elements in the hands of a proper graphic artist could be absolutely gorgeous. Like the CE box.)

However it takes a long time to teach, even longer to grok and the 90 min playtime on the box  is optimistic. If you have to teach new players plan on 3-4 hours. With five experienced players it still takes 2.5-3 hours. It took the same with just three. 

Not that long games are bad, but this game is really random - its a card game where you only use 1/2 or less of the available cards. Expensive cards may show up early when its difficult to play them, or worse, late when the payoff may not be there. Games may be heavy in certain types of cards making a hacendado bonus really good, or types may be few making a bonus poor. Some cards may show up early and economically depress the entire first 1/3 of the game. I realize managing the chaos fits thematically, but I think it could really shine with a better overall arc to the game. If the card pool could be made up into phase I, phase II and phase III decks then stacked into the full game deck, perhaps this could be achieved.

Masterpiece! In my opinion, this game has the best win-mechnanick in all the games I know. Massively interesting decision and always possibilities to make better moves. Each game feels fresh, as other cards come to the market. Best to play with 4 players.

RATING: 10
This game is a phenomenal design effort. Every card drips with theme and the way the cards interact can result in a very roller-coaster game, reminiscent of how I might imagine revolutionary Mexico to be! I'm not at all familiar with the history, but the game certainly feels as if the environment of the times is well portrayed. 

It's a complex game - getting a full understanding of the rules is not the easiest task, and that's before developing an understanding of tactics and strategy that might win a game. So be aware that some effort is required (or find someone who knows the game to introduce it to you.) BGG forums and files are excellent aids to understanding the game.

Great game and a very unique one also, quite unlike anything else I've played before. More plays may yet raise this to a 10 and "masterpiece" status! Recommended.

Either a Saint Petersburg on steroids or a streamlined, playable Through the Ages. Either way, the game system here is simple (3 actions to do from a menu), but it comes to life through the cards and their interactions on the table (Enterprises, Troops, others). Go strong in 1 of 4 VP paths and attempt to declare victory (toppling of Diaz) by one of them -- cute thing is one of the VP paths, Outrage, is primarily gained by being screwed by others (or screwing yourself). Speculating on cards is a nice twist on the standard supply track ('reserving' it in a way, forcing others to pay you if they nab it before you can at an affordable cost).

A few plays on Yucata later, I'm giving this the stamp of approval. Saint Petersburg for dicks (including masochists). Nationalize, extort, steal, assassinate, topple instead of playing and throwing all kinds of cards all over the place since the terms all have some meaning in the narrative, rare and impressive for abstracted card games. Creative combos are discovered organically, and pulling off a successful topple (winning) often requires an Outrage-ous play out of nowhere that is immensely satisfying.

5+4

This is about as heavy and meaty as a card game can get, but it is worth it.  It helps to learn it with someone who has played or is at least well-versed in the rules, but even then it was a good 30 minutes to teach.  The gameplay is excellent.  There is screwage all over the place and lots of laughs to be had as you watch businesses get burned to the ground.  Very fun stuff and definitely WORTH the time investment.

So as I'm in the middle of my 100th play of this, it dawns on me that this really is perfection.  It's deep and there are so many factors to keep track of that it fills my mind perfectly to the brim, like the best cup of coffee you've ever had.  It's a sublime blend of complexity and theme.  I grant it a 10 - only my 10th ever out of over 550 ratings - and it's totally deserved.

Played 1 4P game. Rating this is kind of tricky. Pax Porfiriana marries the thematic integration of wargames with the engine-building of Euros, and it's an offbeat hybrid. For starters, there are a number of subrules (strife, jail, chain connections) to read into, and being listed in the glossary instead of the main rules tends to get them lost in the noise of the other terms which have been previously repeated. But once the rules are read and digested, the game is simpler and more intuitive than imagined. The way each card can be manipulated is interesting and thematic, although with the sheer variety of cards, it can take a while to familiarise yourself with them.

Finally, I enjoyed reading the history and philosophy of game design in the rulebook. The designer liberally sprinkles his political and world views throughout, and while I often do not agree with him, it does make an entertaining read.

 I'm not so much an admirer of Phil Eklunds' designs for various reasons. However this one seems to fit my taste: Historical, really dirty theme, economics, and most important some people who's opinion I respect praise it a lot.
 Very nice box, small and portable, and it is really amazing for me as someone who deals with visual arts how it happened that a game wit such beauty in its card designs doesn't have a decent rulebook that can fit in the box but rather an ugly piece of paper. Luckily the German publisher I ordered it from sent me an additional rulebook in a more decent format.
 Let's learn and play it now to see if it will meet the high expectations.

My very favorite game of all time. I swear that every time I play, it is a very different game entirely. You must quickly adjust your strategy, and not get distracted by short term goals. It is beautifully designed, balanced, and illustrated. You even learn a bit of history as you go along.

Very much a preliminary rating, as the game is pretty tough to grasp from the rulebook. While the art is really nice and the game is thematic, I found it hard to understand all of the game mechanics by looking at them, and it's almost as if they blend a little too easily from one usage to the next. Certainly it's fascinating how many different ways there are to win, and there's plenty going on here, so I'd like to give it a couple more plays before really settling in on a final rating. Definitely has some potential, though.

UPDATE: Got in a couple of more plays, and my rating is moving up! It still is bizarre, and I think it's hard to see exactly what is going on, but I appreciate how different this is. It's a classic sneaky race game in that you want to effectively surprise your opponents during a topple, which is tough to do. Still, you get some nice tension knowing that you may have to buy some cards just to have a few points to stop your opponent from the win.

an engaging ride through pre-revolutionary Mexico as players battle to take the reins of power as Diaz is toppled. like Pax Pamir above, you must pay attention to your tableau, what your opponents are doing, the market, the current regime and victory conditions. very immersive and exciting in both its rich subject and layered game play.

RATING: 7
Phil Eklund's games aren't like other games. There's always a steep learning curve, and Pax is no different. It's also more of a competitive game than his previous work, which tended more toward simulations. When you step back a bit, you realize that Pax isn't that complex. The rules are about as elegant as they could be, all things considered, but there are [i]many[/i] things to consider.

Every game of Pax plays differently because there's a huge pile of cards and you only use a portion of them each game. There's a lot of unpredictability and randomness in the card draw. The market moderates it somewhat, but the draw heavily influences choices and opportunities. I haven't decided whether or not there's too much luck. As a simulation, it's fine; as a game, at two hours, it might be a bit much. But it's certainly interesting, and repeat play is only improving my view as playing time decreases and the game opens up.

1 play, 3er

This is a cool card-drafting, tableau building game. The cards come in 2 rows, sliding down (costs decreasing) as people grab the cards. These initially go into your hand and can later be played to your own tableau, other players' tableaus, or as actions (often attacking others, although they get compensation). There are SO MANY cards, and you only play with a small subset of them! And it seems like they're almost all different ... quite a lot to try to learn in the first game!

I did pretty poorly, as to be expected for a game of this complexity! Still, it was enough to see that there could be something here! I'm not exactly happy with the graphic presentation, though: the cards are busy, and UGLY! There's also a lot of take that in the game, but the fact that you get compensation seems it might make up for it. Definitely need to try this again!

quite possibly the best produced card game I own. The artwork, text and functionality of each of the cards (they are all unique) is quite amazing.

Game playing is fabulous - players are trying to topple the Mexican government by fair means or foul. The game is tremendously interactive with assets being hijacked, partners assassinated, roaming bands of soldiers appropriating all they can - despite the seething politics and change its no random take that fest - players need to find a strategy and work to it. The number of unique cards means this game has limitless replayablity.

For me this game feels old-timey.  The gameplay is basically pick a card, play a card. Which means it's all tactics and very little strategy.  Doesn't seems to fit too much with the original and interesting theme.  Add to that a lot of take that and it's a recipe for leader bashing and player elimination.

The lackluster art design really hurts the flow of the game and the playing time.  It turns me off from the game for sure.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting historical card game set during the reign of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th century. Players buy cards representing enterprises, historical individuals, events and troops in the hope of a coup when one of the four "topple" cards is bought. If the current regime is "Pax Porfiriana", you want high loyalty points to become Diaz's appointed successr; under Martial Law you want high command points for a military coup; Anarchy requires a revolution, etc. Technically speaking, winning requires a "tripartite majority", meaning more points than Diaz (2-3) and your two lowest-scoring opponents.

The game has been compared to Innovation, in part because cards sometimes feel similarly insane: the "Sovereign Sonora" card, for example, nationalizes (read: discards) all enterprises in the Sonora district, about a third of those in the game, and prevents players from playing any more unless it is destroyed. Many cards are wild game-changers and there is room for very strong combos.

That said, if Pax Porfiriana is like Innovation, it's in the combination of special powers, incentive management, and wildly tactical play. In Innovation, it's useful and important to manage your displayed symbols to leech off -- or, more likely, prevent -- an opponent triggering a juicy ability. There's a lot of this in PaxPo. Plantations give cheap income, but opponents can relatively easily foment a slave revolt by adding unrest tokens; buying a card that adds unrest makes other players less likely to pick up that plantation. One card causes money spent on enterprises in Mexico to go to that player instead of to the bank, making them less attractive. The Through the Ages-style card train means good-but-expensive cards get cheaper if you buy something less interesting at a lower price, but that will make the better card cheaper for the enemy.

It's a tangled web of incentives, with the looming threat of an imminent topple ratcheting up the tension as soon as a player gains even a small lead on their tripartite. You might have to buy a card just so an opponent can't get its influence point. Even more interesting, attack cards generally give "victim-awarded" points (i.e., American outrage or local revolutionary sentiment on their behalf -- "he is being oppressed!"). That partner cards is powerful, but can you afford to assassinate it and help the owner's revolutionary ambitions? It can be a better idea to assassinate your own partner just for the point!

Most cards have fascinating flavour text (I particularly like "Pancho's Coffee", which describes a plot to kill Pancho Villa with poisoned coffee -- it failed when he repeatedly drank the toxic brew with no ill-effect) and those who like storytelling in their games can weave narratives of alternate Mexican history.

All that sounds like a recipe for a game I would love, but I find myself utterly ambivalent. The ending in particular is problematic. Games are likely to end in one of two ways: either rapidly, when someone will have enough money to pump their points, possibly change the regime and cause a topple, all in one turn; or as a long, drawn out whimper as players fail to achieve a topple and end the game on money.

With five players it's too chaotic and likely to be too long; with fewer there is less chaos but the incentive management is less felt -- I'm not sure there is a sweet spot.

The random deck setup is also troubling. Some games will be pathological (an early depression and/or no cheap enterprises slow things down dramatically), and you certainly can't plan: it's entirely possible that the regime change you need to win is not even in the deck. I'm sensitive to the argument that this is an historical simulation where, as in real life turmoil, the best you can do is try and hold on and make the best of opportunities as they appear, but does that make for a satisfying [i]game[/i]? 

The rules are written for reference rather than learning, and the mix of historical chrome and complex card interactions makes it a pain to pick up and play. It needs a learning rulebook as well as one for reference. It's a pain that you can barely squeeze in the game contents into its tiny box, let alone the other required components -- it plays rather more smoothly with price markers for the cards (16, 8, 4 etc.) and in particular an influence tracking board. It is very difficult to track points in play based on card symbols, and if you think the game ending on an abrupt topple feels cheap, wait until it happens because you missed seeing a symbol.

Intriguing! But does the chaos of the gameplay repay the rules overhead and the time? I'm not sure. But I am still interested in finding out. (It's not every game that inspires me to a comment this long!)

Hard game for me to rate.  I like the historical theme, but the game is crazy chaotic, and I'm not super excited about playing 2+ hour games where it feels like I spend the whole time just preventing each other player from winning.

Another terrific game from SMG, and not too difficult to understand (the tutorial videos helped a lot) despite a plethora of rules/play questions (a little homework here on BGG cleared most items up).

I really enjoy the slow build-up as Hacendados jockey for position. Each player needs to pay careful attention to Prestige Points, the Regime, their own strategies, opponents' strategy, money, cards in the market, etc. It's all rather addicting without being overwhelming.

Full of flavor and fun, this is a remarkably deep and engaging game (addictive even). I definitely would want to see more titles using this system.

From the theme, to the story told by each game, to the outright backstabbing and chicanery involved in playing, this is a blast to play.  A lot of rules to learn at first, but worth the time and effort.  A lot of the game feels like flailing around in the midst of chaos, because it is.  Ultimately, however, the one who comes out on top is the one who uses the chaos to disguise his or her true intentions/strategy until the trap springs and it is too late to stop the win.  Sun Tzu would approve.  And I approve of Sun Tzu.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say I even dig the graphics and busy card layout.  I mean, this is turn-of-the-century Mexico, is it not?  It's supposed to be a little crazy and chaotic.  

There's beauty in all that chaos; you just have to look at it right.

RATING: 9
Pax Porfiriana is definitely worth the hype and I hope that it will be put into a larger print-run to satisfy the demand. The game's designers have expertly merged the historical facts, events, and figures of this turbulent period of Mexican History. They've married its game mechanics to that theme. Its gameplay creates an ever changing historical narrative of which players feel a part and have a stake. The rules require a few readings to understand these mechanics, but, the overall game is simple once you walk-through a few plays. The graphics on the cards could be improved, but, they are largely intuitive. Players assume the identity of various competing Haciendados, each with their own unique advantages. Each Haciendado works toward satisfying the game's victory conditions, all hoping to topple the aging and corpulent dictator, Porfiriano Diaz. They do this by gathering enough toppling points in the categories mandated by the different regimes that occur during the game or by simply thwarting their opponents from doing the same until they can muster the resources needed to launch their own coup d'état to topple Diaz. Players must consider the ever changing conditions and purchase beneficial cards as they appear in a flowing card market. How will you earn the gold needed to fuel your own coup d'état? You use start gold or the gold earned from revolutionary plots and plotters, exploiting troops, outright theft, and the establishment of economic enterprises that are represented by the cards played from one's hand and placed into your tableau. Players in Pax Porfiriana are literally plunged into the turbulent setting of the Mexican Revolution's political economy and Machiavallian intrigue. Pax Porfiriana does an excellent job of creating and maintaining this experience. During gameplay the players can feel the tension, excitement, and flux of Revolution. I don't believe that there is another game on the market in such a small package that is able to successfully create such a rich historical narrative as well as Pax Porfiriana. The events and characters which unfold during Pax Porfiriana's gameplay are fascinating, and, the fact that actual history is being used here makes it all the more magnetic because you'll want to see how your Mexican-Revolution-in-a-box will evolve--it evolves a different way each time you play. Pax Porfiriana especially works well in a PBEM environment, but, it is equally good face-to-face. It's a work of genius. I truly can't wait for its sequel, Pax Renaissance!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A rather unique tableau builder with tons of direct conflict and plenty of luck. As Mexican Hacendado's trying to gain power to replace Diaz you buy and sell enterprises, send out troops to extort your opponents or protect yourself, hire or assassinate partners and many other things. The game receives criticism for its graphic design but it has resulted in a beautiful game, albeit one that it difficult to play across a table. It's the sort of game that takes you on a journey, some of which you'll control but the destination isn't all your own. Recommended for anyone wanting something off the beaten path.
An impressive design with lots of character and history but as a game I have two major concerns:
-the difficulty of reading the cards and the delays that adds to the game
-highly random nature of the cards in play can determine the game

Due to the above I see this as more of an experience game, something you play for the ride not the competition, for the feeling of being Hacendados, of plotting, scheming and hopefully toppling Diaz. 

I'l be keeping an eye on any future Eklund designs.

This game makes it just feel like you are plotting to overthrow Porfiriana, enriching yourself from the regime, or trying to orchestrate an American invasion for your own personal interests.  One of the best themes I've seen in a long time in that it really feels like you are there.  Comparable to Avalon Hill's Civilization, Twilight Struggle or 1989 in that regard.  But you can also play it in less than two hours.  But, it is also easy to learn and comes with a great rule book and strategy guide.  Even my friends who aren't hardcore gamers really like this game.

Lots going on in a very dense package.  The interesting bit is that a large number of cards are removed at the start of every game so each game seems like it would be very different.  Random elements within a more rigid political structure, sort of what I envision that time period was like.  Definitely want to explore it some more.

RATING: 8
The graphic design is horrible. I don't care what anyone else says. It makes my eyes bleed.

That said, I quite enjoyed the game. It's essentially a money building engine game where you're trying to collect VPs, but they come in 4 different types. At various points you can buy a card to bring about the end game at which point you must have more points in the chosen type than the 2 lowest scoring opponents, plus 2.

It sounds all quite simple written that way.

The luck of the draw probably has some impact in who wins, or at least does well, but there are enough cards that come out, it should balance out. I do also wonder if, given the number of cards you take out, how likely it is that your character bonus could be completely useless.

Also, it does run a little long when the game continues until the 3rd or 4th topple.

Update: I'm liking this a little more every time I play it. Each game has seemed to be pretty distinctly different, depending on what cards come out and even the odd ones (we had a depression that started in the first turn or so and lasted for ages) seem to work at telling a different, alternate, story.

Rating up from 6.8 to 7.2 to 8.

Other stuff: Long economic depressions kill the game a little for me. Yes, it might be an interesting event to happen in the game, but it's not fun to have a 2 hour-long depression where no-one can generate any income.

Also, my main complaint is that this is too easy to win. Maybe I should stop playing with Martin... :P

RATING: 8
Beautiful, brilliant, and less mind-boggling than I was anticipating (though that requires someone (read: me) spending a good deal of time memorizing the obtuse rulebook and iconography before the first play).  It really is incredible how much game Eklund et al crammed into that little box.

What I'm most impressed with is the rich history that is depicted on each and every card (and there's over 200 of them) and how fluidly this history is incorporated into the mecahnics.  Despite the reputation of card games being inherently abstract, this is as thematic as any other game I've played.

This game has the highest play-to-size ratio in my collection. With a single deck of cards and some tokens that fit into a small box, you can easily have two and a half hour sessions, packed with drama, strategy, battles, negotiation, clever tricks, and surprise victories.

I can't tell how I feel about the game entirely; it is unique in my collection, and thus hard to place in comparison to other games. I like the depth and the various paths and processes to follow, but the high variability can result in some very lopsided play, and the complexity of setting up a win makes feeling confident with a win unusual.

Sweet, sweet Eklund goodness, packed into a tableau-building card game for 1-4 players?  That sentence makes my heart beat a little faster.  

Not everyone's cup of tea, for sure, but I love love love it (thanks for gifting it to me, Dano!)  SO much depth in a relatively teachable package, and it really does evoke the feeling of the time period.  There was a moment in the first game I played in which I realized that I was getting involved simultaneously with anarchists and hardline nationalists -- and then I sold both of them out and retired with a small fortune.  Perfect!

The best card game in existence.

My desire to play stems from the way this game conveys the feeling of a power struggle so well.  You are constantly taking risks, interfering with other players, and basically fighting tooth and nail to gain a foothold in this tumultuous time period of Mexico.  Incredible, quite possibly my favorite card game ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I will preface this by saying I mostly played this game two player. As a two player game, this is not a good game. It becomes a race to four and is hard to come back once a player is behind. As a three player game, it's alright, but not something I would ever suggest playing. There are too many rules for what it is. Most of the rules make sense and are thematic, but there are too many special rules that are hard to remember and/or difficult to find in the discombobulated rule book.

The theme of this game is very good and comes through beautifully. I can't remember a time I got a feeling from a game like I did from this game. During one play, we were in a depression nearly the entire game. The weight of the depression could be felt in the grind of trying to put anything together. The range of experiences with having so many cards come out in a a near infinite arrangement is very cool.

RATING: 10
This! Yes, more of this! This is an awesome game. Talk about dynamic and well thought out. Talk about a game that can frustrate and excite you at the same time. Talk about a game where you feel the theme pushing through in all those little mechanics. Talk about a tableau builder that matters not only what you put into play but when. Man...just so much here to talk about...I'm going to stop talking about it now. Play this game. 

I don't go in for collector editions of games I already have. I just don't see it as a wise use of funds. This game however offers a board for both this and Pax Pamir which really does add functionality to the game big time. To make my own boards for both of those games would be more than what I paid for the CE. So I have a CE game now. Also upped the rating to a 10 because this game deserves that.

[Hadn't] finished first playing yet but man. I'm playing this (nearly) on the heels of another market-driven game, If Wishes Were Fishes, and "PP" seems to have this similar issue where stuff nobody wants or can use clogs up the market. I keep finding myself with a spare action, and consider speculating on some card in the market, but I can't find even one that I think somebody will buy. I largely blame the orange screwage cards whose effects are based on prestige point counts of types nobody even has yet. [NOTE: It's been brought to my attention that such cards can be useful to play against yourself to get the victim-awarded prestige.]

Some of the take-that cardplay is too direct and simple for my taste. One player (hacendado card) has the ability to buy black cards for free. So he buys one that nationalizes an enterprise and which costs nothing to play... So he sinks another player's enterprise (and incidentally the army that was defending it), which was basically all the owner had in the game, for a total cost of no money and three actions.

I expect or expected a sort of commodity speculation aspect to the game, given the various types of prestige points you can accumulate in order to try to topple Diaz under various political states. At the moment I'm a little skeptical that you have much freedom to explore this. "Other priorities" are largely to blame, but your particular hacendado card does seem to restrict what you can realistically do.

Of other games I've played its feel is like a more complicated Red Empire (with the take-that and color coding) or secondarily Princes of the Renaissance (with a market instead of auctions) (PotR being another game that seems like it theoretically is about commodity speculation).

...Tried my first 1p game. You play against an AI player. This mitigates somewhat my criticisms above because the AI buys stuff from the market at random, so it's not going to get clogged up, and you at least know that your opponent has no qualms about playing screwage cards against you.

I had fun, at least early on, until I couldn't help but notice that I was breaking even at best. I finished the game (a loss) with nothing in play at all. I had a few gold and four victim-awarded prestige of two types (you generally need at least five of the [i]same[/i] type to beat the AI), but the one enterprise I'd had was nationalized and all my income was coming from the loyalty-based allowance you have from the start of the game. And this allowance is incompatible with having any private army. I eventually could not think of anything to do to get back into the black except spend all my actions speculating on the most expensive cards, hoping the AI would pick them, giving me cash.

I'm not giving up on this game just yet but I think the balance of mechanisms is skewed so that enterprises tend to get destroyed (esp. nationalized). I think lots of the fun of this game should be building up your little economic empire tableau, and sticking troops and railroads on it. I don't think I should end the game with nothing at all!

...Tried a 1p again, but cheating, giving myself an inherent income. This was a lot less frustrating and allowed me to perceive some interesting decisions. You can rack up all the gold you want, but at least against the AI, that won't win you the game. You have to figure out how to get the prestige points you need before the AI buys and junks all the topple opportunities.

So my conclusion is that this is potentially an interesting game that requires either tweaks, or for me to be a lot better at it.

...[i]But[/i] really, the interest I have in this game is limited by the depth of player interaction. You can compete with others in the drafting market (as in plenty of euros) but there's so little use for cooperation, or complex interactions among what different players do. I normally like games with 4+ players but here I don't think more players adds much to the experience.

RATING: 10
[u]Update after 12 plays.[/u] 3-player with experienced players it takes on incredible nuance; a shared incentive structure which is quite lively & tractable, an amazing player driven balancing act between topple battles and creating conditions for a (likely) money endgame.

At 3-player the game decidedly peaks. Finding card plays to effect both your opponents is an exquisite sort of nastiness and it really punishes making a stoppable move on a political win. At this count, it takes on the intensity and nail-biting drama of a play of Twilight Struggle.

Also - at all counts, playing with open hands highly recommended. The game elevates immediately. Gone are the 'Oh that's right you had that' topples, and instead it's won in a satisfying manner.

Moves into my top games because at 3-player it becomes epic.

*

Six plays and I love this game. It's moved up to a '10.' 

[b]Pax [/b]takes a bit of hacking before it flowers into a beautiful thing: intense interaction with a weird sort of reciprocal kickback. Meaning, you hit someone and the game kicks you back... hit their ranch, they get Outrage (the political economy), that sort of thing. This gives it so much texture. 

I enjoy reading a rich game state, upending it dramatically, and incentives that aren't always what they seem and this is a great fit. Not that the game is opaque, so he game is seeable but not calculable... you can wack each other, collaborate, and everything in between; the interactions are a complex tug-of-war using a net instead of a rope. The response of each to these shenanigans is where the game turns.  

Similar to [b]Innovation [/b]I can see it being a bellweather game of sorts. In that people who need to feel in control, or who will mistake their situation as irrecoverable when it isn't, or who do not value adaptability in the face of pressure will not enjoy this as much as I.

And finally, Phil & Matt Ecklund has made one of the richest thematic integrations of a game I've ever seen. And do not think the brutal machinations of power and drama that thread the Mexican Revolution are irrelevant to what I see going on around us. Reading the fascinating book [i]Villa & Zapata[/i] while learning the game has been a wonderful experience. Every card I'm visualizing the history, the people, the remarkable resonance of the game's historical references and the mechanics with a defining piece of the continent's history. The thematic hitching is seamless, it is so much more than 'flavor text,' and it puts games like [b]Seasons [/b]into a puzzling irrelevance for me both as a game and thematic head scratcher.

Anyway, hey, the next great card game has arrived.

You can poison Pancho Villa's coffee. Yup, American intelligence keeps trying, shadows of Castro. Starbuck's cultural invasion may have finally nailed down the coffee idea while intelligence has moved on to drones for this sort of thing.

The most interesting Eklund I've played from a mechanical perspective, but still has the quirks that keep his games a thematic joy.  I don't know much at all about this period of Mexican history, but this game covers the broad strokes in an intuitive and easy-to-follow fashion.  You're encouraged to play to your historical counterpart, but the variable nature means that you have to be able to seize opportunity when it presents itself.  Really a neat package.

(Feb 2015 After 1 3p game) - Talk about some "busy" looking cards.   A very sharp and well thought card system.

Would play again.

Mechanically, it's a cross between Innovation (mega-turns), Eminent Domain (money generating property tableau) and Ascension (buying from a shifting marketplace).

The real draw is the intense theme, which allows players to construct their own version of Mexican history. Our first game ended in an absolutely hilarious situation where a plantation owner hired Zapatista anarchists to cause slave revolts in his own plantation to generate US sympathy so Teddy Roosevelt would sent troops to invade Mexico, winning him the game. Great stuff! Very interested to learn more about what really happened during this period in Mexican history.

Not that daunting as can seem at first sight, nonetheless this is a game that comes down a little too much as luck of the draw (according to which cards are casually selected at the beginning of the game to compose the draw deck) and which is anyway too heavy to be enjoyed as a light take-that game. In the end, it falls in the gray area which try to be enjoyable for all, but actually is enjoyed by neither heavy nor lighter gamers.

It's a constant back and forth between players, but the clever design of the five paths of victory (four chances of topple and wealth) gives you many options each turn to change the strategy.

RATING: 9
Pax Porfiriana is like a mash-up of Bios Megafauna and Twilight Struggle. Like most Eklund games the rulebook leaves something to be desired, although this one reads much easier than High Frontier or Bios. The issue with this one is that some important concepts and rules exceptions are in the glossary, not the main rulebook and that the card reference is printed on the box instead of a relevant place in the rules. I'm sure this cut down on the cost factor, but it certainly doesn't help with getting through the learning curve.

That being said, once you have a game under your belt it plays very smoothly. There are a ridiculous amount of cards and all of them have unique stats, art, historical context and flavor. Like BiosMegafauna, this is both a game and a history lesson...not to mention a sandbox full of what-ifs. You only use a randomized portion of the cards in each game, with absolutely nothing to guarantee the distribution of each card type, so no two games are ever the same. Some games may be full of money, other games full of guns and misbehavin' and still others might be so buried in economic depression that the players can do nothing but scrape by and try to manufacture a win by robbing and harassing their own holdings. It's a fascinating trip and well worth the time getting to know the game.

I have only played this a couple of times as of this writing, but I must release my enthusiasm for this terrific game by Phil Eklund.

This tiny little box of cards, chips and cubes packs a potent but subtle punch...like a favored fragrance that enchants with it's subtle mix of intoxicants to the senses.

This card game, if one could call it merely a card game, is rich...and I mean rich...with history and theme. During a very chaotic time in Mexico's history, circa 1900, you play one of six 'hacendados' who ultimately will try to topple Mexico's leader, Diaz. 

There are four Regimes, (American Intervention, Anarchy, Martial Law, Pax Porfiriana), that each have a favored type of 'achievement', (Outrage, Revolution, Command, and Loyalty). Essentially, you want to topple Diaz by accumulating more of an achievement than he would have. But you must carefully monitor and manipulate the regimes, so that you can wield the power to do so succesfully.

You do this through growing enterprises, (making money), exploiting others enterprises, (making money and financially hurting opponents), causing unrest, (hurting business), acquiring 'Partners' (Cards which feature people with special abilities that you can use), and deploying troops that can help or hinder businesses.

Along with all of that, you can do a lot of little things like 'Nationalize' an enterprise (taking down a business completely), assassinate a Partner (just what it says), extend land ownings, upgrade transportation methods, (this will determine the cost to deploy troops to that destination)...and a lots of other little things you can do based on cards text, the current Regime in play, etc.

The whole game is played essentially from a center of 12 cards called the 'Market'. You will buy cards from the market to put in hand, or play for a cost. Buying is one of three actions you can take in a turn. The market is ever changing, and the variety is such that you will probably always find a couple of cards you want.

The 'Headline' Cards are what keep the economy running...but discard two 'Red Bears' in a row, and everyone goes into a depression, though it is reversible, and you will see it coming.

It all comes down to whatever you plan on doing, the game provides dynamic ways for you to try and achieve your goals accompanied with historical illustrations and information that submerses you into Mexican power plays circa 1900.

Although it sounds like a 'mean' game...and it is...the 'meanness' does not incite ire. Instead of feeling 'personal' it feels 'natural'...like being mean is just par for the course rather than 'take that'. It's like, "I'm stepping on your toes because we are all too close in this little spot of politcs, and I want to move left so naturally, your in the way". You generaly don't hurt someone else unless there is a reason to. In fact, with careless moves against an opponent, you could reward them with achievements!

This is one excellent game. I feel thoughtful, ambitious, and capable when playing, and it culminates in a real historical, Mexican experience that I want to partake of again and again.

[i]Pax Porfiriana[/i] may have the most distracting graphic design of all time.  No joke. Even if you can forgive its gee-whiz advertising veneer, it's still got problems.

There's no way that I'd play with more than 3 people, both for time reasons and the fact that a perceived leader can get HAMMERED by the other players.  Frankly, I'm reluctant to play with more than two.

The historical detail is thoughtful, engrossing, and informative, but that's where my admiration ends.  [i]Porfiriana[/i] is a hopelessly obtuse design that needs a good pruning.

A friend of mine had described Pax Porfiriana as a cross between Innovation and a Phil Eklund game, which rings pretty true.  It's got a diversity of card powers like Innovation, but in a more restricted way, and it's got the Eklund feel, but it's very much a game, not just an experience or a simulation.  Each player is trying to topple president-for-life Porfirio Diaz in early 20th century Mexico in one of four ways (succession, revolution, US intervention, and the other thing) and the opportunity to employ each of the four ways only comes up once per game.  So players are jockeying for being strongest in each of the four categories while also trying to build enough infrastructure to actually be able to take action.  If no one can topple Diaz after the fourth card, most gold wins; that's how our first 3-player game ended.  There's a good amount of player interaction, both direct and indirect.  And it looks like there will be plenty of variety between plays because you only use about half the deck in any given game.

This is one hell of a deep, and interesting historical game. It taught me about a period of time, and a place that I knew little about. I love that about Phil Eklund's games, that they teach you something in an captivating manner.

This tableau builder is hard to compare to others, but I adore it. I love how you are free to use your three actions as you wish amongst the nine available, as long as you can afford them. The gameplay is fierce, and it features a ton of interaction.

It is also a brisk game, at least once mastered. It proved to be the first in a series of fantastic games, and I'll be first in line for any future Pax titles from Sierra Madre Games.

What great stories this game tells.  Political intrigue and back stabbing... and stabbing your own back.  Pax Por is difficult to learn from the rulebook and surprisingly hard to grok even when taught well for what can be a rather straight forward game (put cubes on cards to make money... to buy more cards... to play to either get more cubes for your money engine or to get points).  I don't think this will ever be a favorite but I'm still fascinated by how such an interesting game comes out of what can feel like a mess the whole time you're playing.

Not sure I played with all of the rules correctly. I can tell there is a good game in there, not sure it's for me.

Although the rules may at first seem daunting to novice gamers (like me) i would highly recommend this game. after a few rounds of play it all makes sense and soon becomes highly addictive. This is an excellent game. 

update- played some more and have to increase this to a 9 almost the perfect game, i love it

Why even bother getting together to game if you're not even going to interact with each other in the game itself?

Machiavellian cardgame with high player interaction and narrative driven. Grew tired of building an optimal economic engine builder? Get Porfiriana ! He wrecks your economy with unrest, depressions, extortion and leaching. While you're at it you might even wreck your own buildings. Learn to love the leachers because now they are invested in your investments, try different strategies, to win without economy buildings... Oh beloved Porfiriana you learn me to love brittle economics and adapt, thrive and wield power in the revolutionary chaos of the Mexican civil war. 

For the few critics in here that say there's no decision: 

It's full of decisions. There's soo much possible ways you can play the game, but you have to set yourself up while reading the context of everything on the table. It's rather difficult to pick a typical eurogame strategy at the beginning (for example I will invest heavily in buildings), the cards you want may not be in the deck. Instead there's another type of strategy the game uses.(see further) To help you, you get a hand were you can store up to five cards for future play. The moment one player buys his first card, interaction starts happening. You never play on your own island. Therefore reading the tableaus and picks of the other players is very important. 

So you start making decisions not only if a card would be useful for you, but also if you can possibly speculate and make money from other players choices, if you should play certain cards to alter the state of the game, if you should buy and sell cards to deny them to your opponent, if you should play a card to gain you a steady income but considering it might give an opportunity to the other players to leech from you, you can even decide to play a card that's so good that others must target it, thus giving you points. But most importantly when to buy and when to play a certain card is a difficult decision.  

About perceived chaos in the game: 

The game constantly creates different situations. How do you decide to react to them. Here is were your strategy can help you. Having kept cards in your hands might have set you behind the income curve of other players, but now has hightened your chances to deal with new situations or play surprises that other players forgot about. Though often a pile of money gets you out of a sticky situation just as well. Since the game is decided through hoarding points of a certain colour or by money, it now becomes an interesting choice of spending a card for it's useful ability and take certain powerful cards away from my opponents, or keeping cards around so when topples come out you'll have the right kind of points to play. 

About luck of which topples comes out of the deck:
 
You can indeed gamble and play risky putting all eggs in one basket, but this will not work often. If this succeeds people say, it was all luck that this topple came out at that moment. Yeah but he played high risk. And even so this strategy seems to me as very vulnerable to counterplay and you'll still need to buy other cards to make it work. For example going heavy on command, you'll still need to count on your opponents to play buildings or upgrade connections.
The beauty in this game lies in the fact that you can still use most cards regardless of the points they give you. The player that invested a lot in command, still has units to extort other players.

Intriguing design... tense, varied, a variety of tactical and strategic options, and a fascinating theme, which the game conveys quite well. My advice if learning the game on your own: make sure to read the Glossary from start to finish, some rules are *only* in the glossary.

Some analysis paralysis issues due to no hidden information (other than fairly easily tracked cards) and the importance of paying attention to what people are picking up, and what all the cards in the market can do. Can go longer than expected (2-3 hours) since timing the actual win can be tricky even when you are doing well. With attentive players this can go the long haul since it's difficult to surprise anyone during those brief parts when a topple attempt is possible.

Unfortunately, this combination of factors (having to pay attention to everything but things get predictable and logjammed once everyone does so) along with the playing time keeps it away from the table.

A nitpick about the card design: the too-subtle difference between Chihuahua and Sonora cards can be annoying. Perhaps a colour-coded map of the territory would have been preferable to a flag.

It's an enjoyably distilled version of its card-driven antecedents. And while it brings focus on the tension of the historical event with the looming threat of nuclear war, I still prefer the broader sweeping strokes of Twilight Struggle and Wir Sind das Volk.

RATING: 8.5
Very fun and tense 2 players game. It's supposed to be Twilight Struggle in 30-40 minutes, but I've yet to play TS, so I can't comment on that.

The other player always know your 3 possible goals in each turn, but not which one you chose, so there's always a good amount of bluffing going on.
As in TS, you can use cards to place/remove cubes from the battlegrounds, or for their events. Cards of the other player can be used only for the cubes, but they get to use the event, meaning that you usually don't want to use them. However, the last card remaining in your hand goes to the aftermath pile, which means that if you don't use an enemy card, you'll increase the probability of giving them 2 points at the end of the game.
Placing cubes with command actions (and some of the events) increases your defcon tracks, making it very (and I mean VERY) easy to start a nuclear war and lose the game if you are not careful.
These mechanics leads to quite difficult (but very different) choices.

This is in every way a trimmed down version of Twilight Struggle and 1960. It has the same concepts of event and command points, player driven scoring (Agendas) and thematic integration - including the chance of nuclear war. And it does this very well. One new quality is knowing roughly what Agenda (scoring) your opponent is attempting and you can bluff/counter-bluff in this. And if you gather enough influence to topple your opponent's Agenda, you get to score it instead of them! Overall, quite nice and I like it.

13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis was introduced to me as Twilight Struggle light, and I have to say this is a pretty accurate description because the basic card mechanics are very similar and the theme is the same. The main differences are that each player has a limited amount of influence points at their disposal, and that discards are not reshuffled into a new deck at any point. 

Both changes have a significant impact on the game. Limited influence makes overspending very unattractive while no reshuffles eliminates the primary long term strategy element from the game (i.e. compared to Twilight Struggle). What is left is the crisis management. What to do with your shitty hand, is the question you find yourself asking all the time. Rules in 13 Days are also a bit simpler except for the defcon track which was a bit of a mess compared to other streamlined parts.

Comparing the two aforementioned games is understandable although a bit unfair. 13 Days is a 60-90 minute game of tactical crisis management while TS is a whole night strategy behemoth with a much longer learning curve. Personally I find TS much more satisfying but if I had to choose one to recommend to a random player, 13 Days might be a good choice, maybe.

If [thing=12333][/thing] is not your thing, try this.

It is smaller (45) and shorter (much fewer battlegrounds) and does not require memorizing the card interactions.

It has hidden agendas and a constant push-pull between trying to gain popularity and trying not to go to Nuclear War.

It's the kind of game that a Eurogamer can enjoy as well as a history wargamer.

Great game.  Lots borrowed from Twilight Struggle and similar kinds of games, but it's simpler and faster while maintaining plenty of strategy depth.  Deck knowledge is less important in this one compared to TS, especially because there's a much smaller deck here.

This is not TS. It mimics some card plays and some link to a token placement that could be accounted for in any game, much less TS. 

That aside, component wise is average. The card stock is thin and the visual appeal of the map is only functional. 

The game play however is pretty good with reasonable synergy for both sides to play and have strategies for repeated plays. 

We felt the theme to be of little significance and nothing more than a cube placement type of game. 

Overall, pretty pleasing to play and fast to resolve a complete game in less than an hour. Because of that. It also suffers from lack of depth and tension value.

It is a solid, tactical 2-player game.  You can play through in about 30-40 minutes when you get the hang of it.  Playing with the same person multiple times adds to a meta game, since there is the aspect of trying to read where your opponent's objectives are.

Buen juego, cortito, con faroleo y con mecánicas parecidas al Twilight Struggle. Buen flavor histórico en las cartas.

Actually manages to condense TS into a 30 minute game. Not sure if it will hold up long term or not but after two plays I'm fully on board.

10+ plays in: One of the best ratios of tension to game length there is, and a game I don't think I would ever turn down. Hence, a 10.

RATING: 8
Comparison with its older, bigger brother Twilight Struggle (TS) is inevitable.  In both, the game is mainly about area control.  Whereas in TS more and more areas count as the game progresses, in 13 Days what may count changes from round to round, depending on the deal and choice of agenda cards.  DEFCON looms large - and can bring a premature end - in both games.  Where 13 Days is at its most original is in its three tracks (military, political and world opinion) that each relate to three of the areas being fought over.  Agenda cards can reward a DEFCON higher than your opponent's, but set against this is the constant risk of annihilation and the need to take cubes off the board to avert it.  Strategy cards work the same as in TS, with their choice of ops points/command or an event.  Play an opponent's event in 13 Days and they may choose to trigger it, though that's not always possible or desirable.  In both games the sequencing of card play can be critical.  

Although 13 Days delivers a double espresso TS in a tiny cup, what I don't get from it is much impression of the Cuban missile crisis and how it unfolded.  The nine battleground areas remain stubbornly abstract, while the cards don't offer a great deal of historical flavour beyond their black and white photos. Although 13 Days is fuzzy on the historical detail, there is a strong sense of the bluff and brinkmanship that had the world holding its breath in 1962. 

The artwork is dull but functional. Production quality is acceptable.  My one gripe is about the cards, which are quite flimsy.  The rulebook is OK, though do go and find the official errata and FAQ buried in the rules forum.

Good filler game!
A few things remind you of Twilight Struggle when you play it: the theme (obviously), the card dynamics (ops value vs event, soviet/american/neutral cards), the tit for tat escalation, the defcon track, ...
But 13 Days is a much more abstract and simpler game, with a lot less historical flavor (why is Italy a battleground?), and with a lot less stuff going on.
All this makes for a very quick game: you can play 4 matches in a row in 3 hours.
In summary, a pretty good filler game for two players.

A quick semi-asymmetrical game where cards are played to determine influence in different battlegrounds, ultimately trying to earn prestige.  I haven't played Twilight Struggle, but this reminds me of Cleopatra and the Society of Architects- "be corrupt, but not too corrupt, or you are fed to the crocodiles" in this case, nuclear war. Not too many moving parts, and for a quicker game, I feel it has a lot of depth. Due to the card based play, no game plays out like the previous one, and therefore I feel it has a lot of replayability.

Twilight Struggle lite. The main focus of the game revolves around manipulating Defcon Status and bluffing your opponent. The mechanics are initially extremely counter-intuitive, and teaching the game to new players in a way where they're having fun already in their first game is a definite struggle™. Once everyone knows what they're doing, this is a reasonable substitute to Twilight Struggle -- especially if you're short on time.

Initial Impression: This is a fast, tense politically themed game about a world-changing incident that occurred in our recent history. In the game, there are 3 "battlefields" that the players are fighting over in order to score their hidden agendas. Although the game feels like a tug of war, there's a large deception element to the game as players need to determine which battlefields their opponent is trying to score. Throw a little threat for global thermal nuclear war into the mix and you have a tense game that can accidentally be over after the first turn. It certainly has a "just one more game" feeling to it as the game plays surprisingly fast. I'm very tempted to acquire my own copy of this game.

Twi-lite succeeds pretty well localising everything on the cuban missile crisis and tweaking the TS mechanics.  Rules wise this is more or less as complex as TS but strategy wise it is much more accessible and it is also much quicker with almost no set up time.  Also less need to know the cards which is also a great bonus.  Rules could be laid out better (I got about 5 different rules wrong on first play) and card text could be clearer in a few instances - bad for a game aiming to be an entry point into CDGs but still pretty simple rules and ok rule book with a useful playthrough there too.  Overall fun and I would rather play this (and certainly rather teach this) than TS.  However this is no where near as compelling as Wir Sind Das Volk! which hits my sweet spots for length, interesting decisions, compelling theme and comparative accessibility.

Excellent game of bluff and double bluff, mixed with the quandary of when to use what card, especially as some of the cards can be a real boon for your opponent if played at an inopportune time.

Twilight Struggle in 45 mins? Well yes and no. Of course it is much lighter and has less tension than Twilight Struggle, but that is expected. It is a fun card driven game where you and your opponent are bluffing each other and pushing things to the brink.I would say that it gives you a taste of that game, but I don't love it. It is probably because I love Twilight Struggle so much. I don't dislike this one and it plays fast, but I am missing the meat on the bones when I play it.

Twilight Struggle in 45 minutes is a great description of it.  

It's like 2 bullies standing toe-to-toe in a playground at lunch.  Both want to make the other guy throw the first punch while making sure all the other kids know they're the toughest.  That's the game.  Whoever throws the first punch (triggers nuclear war) loses.  But meanwhile, you've got to dance on that edge to get the prestige of the onlookers.  

Great balancing act and a great game.

Quite a nice little "filler" version of Twilight Struggle! Sure, the main mechanics feel a bit like a rip-off, but I really like the changing agenda mechanic, which makes bluffing a more important mechanic here, along with the Aftermath cards, which lend a little uncertainty to the game end. Of course this is not nearly as tense or as deep as TS, but it is actually quite fun, and much better than any of TS's "lighter" successors (1960, Campaign Manager, Sola Fide).

First play was good. Very easy to learn and quick. Rating likely to go up but not sure how it compares to WSDV and WSDV seems like a much better game at the moment though perhaps much harder to teach and grasp. The question is likely to be if this will be a 2p game to pick up and play with 30-45 mins, as WSDV will take prob twice as long.

I'll rate this one point higher than Twilight Struggle, as I feel like it does the exact same thing, but in a package that pretty much anyone could pick up and play somewhat competently.  With the same sort of tension going on, and the same fun card-driven mechanism, it gives the same satisfaction in a small fraction of the time and investment it takes to play Twilight Struggle.

Overall, just plain an improvement if you like Twilight Struggle, but just don't feel like putting in the time and effort to learn the intricacies of that game and would rather play an extremely similar game more casually.

Tense and deep for its playtime, this one's a keeper.  It most certainly is Twilight Struggle in 40 minutes, which is a whole lot of good and also of course some bad.  The experience isn't quite as thematic or as grand, but it still does capture some of the flavor and a similar decision process with less nuance to save time.  The abstractions here come at a cost, but the cost is well measured and one I'll gladly play.  It still feels like the Cold War and it still feels heavy from a strategy perspective. 

Really enjoy the process of scoring in this game and how the battlegrounds are decided.  Really enjoy the more prominent defcon track and how dynamic it is compared to Twilight Struggle.

This is two player El Grande with a tense theme that rolls up your nerves into a ball and squeezes them for good measure.

While the mechanisms of play are similar to Twilight Struggle, the game play itself feels nothing like it. This feels more like you are playing three rounds of simultaneous three card monty. As such, there's a whole feinting counter feinting thing going on, while you try not to lose by blowing up the world. The blowing up the world is not so much a risk and more of a constraint to your play and a hint to the other player as to which card is the right one in this round's game of three card monty. Unlike in Twilight Struggle, you will never be forced to blow up the world, you can always make sure you don't.

It is fun and fast, but complicated for what you get out of it.  Too complicated considering one can bang out a game in fifteen minutes. In the end, it makes me want to play Twilight Struggle instead.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I had heard a lot of positive buzz, but I figured it was just yet another one of those overhyped games... It's made by two Danish guys (whom I don't know personally, but know who are) - and I've unfortunately played many games by Danish designers that simply aren't that good. This one is, however!

Yes, it's Twilight Struggle light, there's no doubt about it. And generally speaking I actually prefer this game - it's much simpler and easier to understand and play and it's MUCH faster to play. And I actually find that it keeps many of the interesting and tough decisions, which means that this game is just as tense as TS. What I don't like about TS is the length of the game, the amount of plays it takes to get an understanding of the myriad of cards, and the luck-based space race track. 13 Days removes all of those negatives! Sure, there are many different cards to learn, but it's not even remotely in the same scale as TS (there are a couple of crucial cards to know, however; I won our first game due to an ability of a card that let me increase one of my opponent's tracks, which started a nuclear war; that rubbed me the wrong way, but now we know it and will be careful not to make the same mistakes again).

All in all a good game; I'm not the biggest fan of card based games, and generally rate my games low, so this rating is actually quite good.

A good 2 player game with a lot of second guessing and trying to figure out what your opponent is trying to do without trying to do yourself in at the same time. Each round you play 4 cards and resolve the effects between yourself and the opponent while trying to keep your defcon level down on 3 different tracks. It's hard to rate this because I ended up winning in the first round so it was over pretty quick, but I could tell even from that one round it's the type of game I like. I would be up for playing this again and potentially owning it but as a 2-player game it's not one my wife would enjoy so play time for me would be a little limited unfortunately.

I kickstarted this game due to a love of history and a glowing preview from one of my geekbuddies.  At this point in my life I should know that I need to rely on more than a single reference point.

The game was billed as twilight struggle light.  I never played twilight struggle, but the idea of a tense cat-and-mouse game appealed to me.  In the end, however, the game has always fallen flat.  I have never felt tension during a game of 13 days.  Perhaps it is only our play style, but it seemed too easy to do everything you wanted to secure your strategy.  I felt like Cold War: CIA vs KGB better captured the paranoia, brinkmanship, and uncertainty of the time better than 13 days, I wasn't that enamored with Cold War.

Traded.

Lovely thematic and with very interesting decisions, without bogging down with filly rules or components. This is one of the best games published in 2015, and one that will do very well indeed. A masterpiece.

+ Tense and packing lots of decisions over a very short time
+ Easy to teach and to get into
+ Economical in footprint and box size
+ Elegant and well thought out
+ Well balanced
+ Quite replayable, either as a meaty filler
+ Does not require knowledge of the deck to play well
+ Benefits from repeat plays, showing more layers of depth based on deck knowledge
+ Educational, including the little events narrative book

= Confrontational, yet not in a gratuitous way

Had mixed feelings about picking this up, no fan of the theme.

$40.00 MSRP is absurd on this, for what you get, but it seems to be the new trend, then setting a hard core limited discount like Asmodee, Asmodde factors in the "fun" value into the price as extra profit, as I recall in their long hubris response to artificial jacking up prices and setting a max 20 percent off, charging online shops more for their products. You know we are going to charge you an extra $50 on those sneakers  because of the fun factor of wearing them? MSRP by Asmodee reminds me of MSRP set on watches, totally made up, meaningless to used to compare against liked items, which was the purpose in the automobile industry. 

I am buying less and less games because of Asmodee. But I digress how Asmodee is pricing games out of the average buyers market....

This game comes from a smaller publisher, was a Kickstarter project, and not under Asmodee monopoly control so it maybe  a moot point, who knows why that high MSRP?  

It's worth around $20-$25 based on pieces part wise, should have a MSRP of $30 tops. This has cheap very thin cards, at least they are good size,  cheap components, the wooden small cubes, disc been about the only standard thing in the box, there is not a whole lot in the box, . That MSRP is mostly why this game hasn't gotten a following. It's a pity. Had they priced it correctly it would have seen a higher ownership.

I picked it up new for $22.00, it's a decent game that plays quick, I recommend it,  as I say, Twilight Struggle fanboys may not like it, it grand enough,  but I would never get that to the table. 

13 Days makes a good hotel/motel travel game, you might get thru it during lunch.

Not sure about 13 Minutes: The Cuban Missile Crisis, I think they may have watered it down too much.

I do wish they would rethemed it, no fan of that Cold War stuff,  wonder if they could morph it into a horror theme?

PS, you may have some extra wooden disc components, this is normal, I believe they were designed to be used, but were replaced with the included square flags cardboard tokens. The Kickstarter project maybe caused the change to include the flag tokens as an upgrade?

Kickstarted this game a day after playing it at Origins with Ted W under the tutelage of Jim Dietz of Jolly Roger Games. This game is brilliant. If you scoff at the idea of playing "Twilight Struggle in 45 minutes" (which is a very accurate way to describe this game) you'll be missing out on an soon to be classic and just simply a superb game. Tense, direct, elegant, simple and hugely fun. I'd recommend this game to almost any gamer and rate it an immediate must-buy for anyone who likes games like Twilight Struggle. Utterly brilliant. And the visual design of the game and cards is really good.

Final KS copy arrived March 2016. Great components.

Although gameplay is certainly different, this game feels as a (much) shorter version of Twilight Struggle.

I'm dropping my ratting. I was blown away at my first play but multiple opponents just find it flat and I'm agreeing with them. It's a solid game but it's really losing luster on subsequent plays and the interesting tension is sliding away. Which is too bad, it's a nice adaptation of TS in a short time frame.

RATING: 7.5
Try to win the cold war without triggering a nuclear war. On the world map there are 9 battle grounds (3 military, 3 political and 3 ideological), and these battle grounds are connected to corresponding DEVCON tracks. The more influence you exert in one of the 3 fields, the higher you move along the corresponding track. The art is to score prestige points, without moving so high up these tracks that nuclear war is triggered.
The game is played over 3 rounds. The USA and the USSR obtain 3 agendas (corresponding to the battle grounds or DEVCON tracks) each round, of which they have to pick one. All 3 are marked on the map, but only 1 will be resolved for prestige points at the end of the round. Then they get 5 strategy cards, of which 4 are played. The one which is not played goes to the aftermath stack (at the end of the game the superpower with most cubes on the cards in this stack will receive 2 points). The cards can be played for command (=place cubes on the battle grounds, and if more than 1 is placed, move up the DEVCON track), or for the event (if the card is your own or neutral). If the card is one of your adversary, he may choose to trigger the event before you play your command cubes.
The superpower with most prestige at the end of the game is the winner. However, if a superpower triggers nuclear war, he immediately loses.

This fulfills the promise of providing the Cold War feel of Twilight Struggle in a game that takes only 45 min to an hour to play. The board is the perfect size, cards are well designed and the rulebook has a pretty good layout. The only complaint I have is the misprinted Agenda cards for the defcon tracks - every game the wording on them has tripped up someone. The quality of the cards was also pretty poor but a set of sleeves solved that problem.

[6 Oct 2017] - 8 (9 plays)
A good weeknight stand in for Twilight Struggle that contains most of the elements but with 45 minutes of playtime and 5 minutes of setup. While the card play feels very much the same, the map is an abstraction of the actual conflict and loses a bit of realism because of that. The hidden agenda cards and declaring publicly the 3 picked from keeps the mind game alive. Feels much less epic and dire than TS which is why I rated it slightly lower than TS. Still an excellent game that I look forward to playing.

Similar game to High Treason: Trial of Louis Riel in terms of a 2 player tug of war game. Although this game flows much nicer, has better components, and is easier to learn than the former. Seemed to have a big emphasis on trying to bluff your opponent into thinking your going after one thing to waste their time while you secretly try to win your real objective.

RATING: 7
I only rate it this high because of its speedy play.

For such a tiny card pool, the amount of strategic depth is quite impressive.  There is tension there if you let the game crawl under your skin, but I find that overall it is themeless.  

As everyone likes to say, this is Twilight Struggle Light, but at the same time, while you get the same sort of mechanical experience, the thematic experience is lacking.  In TS, I feel like there actually is a struggle between East and West as they attempt to out-maneuver each other and stage coups, fight proxy wars, etc.  In 13 Days, I don't get any of that - instead it just kinda feels like a weird puzzle where your opponent is trying to complete a different section of it.  There is no sense of danger, which is really weird given the supposed subject matter.  If there's tension to be felt, it's in trying to figure out your best move, but since your agendas pretty much direct what you're going to do, there's no setting up for the future as you find in TS and it's really either a) work towards your agenda or b) stop your opponent's agenda or win it outright.

Regardless, take the game as it stands on its own and it's entertaining and has a pretty great decision matrix.  For something so compact and so quick, it's an achievement in design.

It won't replace TS any day, but it may scratch the itch if you let it.

It suffers from being anointed Twilight Struggle lite. I can see the parallels, and it's a fair game, but it's no Twilight Struggle. It's also a similar price (?) and a bit, I don't know, throwaway.

I think the design is great (and I'm giving it an extra point because of that). This does feel like a distillation of Twilight Struggle. However, the strategy is very opaque to me. I often feel like I'm making good choices or the right decisions, but the outcome never seems to be in my favor. I don't think it's random though, since I usually lose more than 50% of the time.

RATING: 7
13 days is an attempt to boil Twilight Struggle to about 45 mins. It's ambitious, and while it doesn't feel exactly the same, you can definitely see the lineage. It does retain the experience of trying to mitigate using cards in your hand that are associated with your opponent's faction. Players still need to be careful with the Defcon tracks or risk losing. I feel this is more of a focal point in 13 days than TS. In TS, it stays at 2 for the majority of the game, and you have to be careful about a few cards. In this game, there are three tracks and each player has a marker on each Defcon track. There are 2 different ways to Defcon suicide: having any one of your markers in Defcon 1 or all of your makers in Defcon 2 at the end of the round. Each marker can be raised and lowered in a variety of ways. Scoring is very unique to this game. Each round the players receives 3 agendas (scoring cards) and marks them on the board. Then, each player secretively picks one and shuffles the other two back in the deck. Those two agenda will be scored and removed from the game this round. Can you deduce the agenda based on what your opponent is doing? Of minor note, I'm not sure how I feel about the see-saw VP track only going to 5 on each side and no immediate wins via VP. All that said, this is an interesting title for those that wished for a 2-player only area control game that plays quickly or simply felt TS is too long.

My brother and I broke 13 Days out over a vacation weekend.  The first game, a learning game, we set off THERMONUCLEAR war in the second round, largely due to not quite understanding how the defcon track agendas worked.  

Our second play was much better.  However, our concern was that the card draw in the final round basically sealed it for me / against him.  He drew 3 defcon track agendas, and then drew a largely unhelpful hand of strategy cards.  It caused what was amounting to a tense ending to feel largely unsatisfying (more so, understandably, for him).

Is that common?  I'm thinking it might not be and I am also thinking that after more plays you would have a better understanding of how to mitigate potential bad draws.  In the end I did enjoy it and my guess is that my initial rating has room to improve.

Wow. They did it. This perfectly distills the TS experience to 30 min. Initial experience is overwhelmingly positive and can't see any flaws at this point. 

Since you only play 4 cards each turn I'm tempted to say that the bluffing element is weak, yet in my initial plays I saw how playing a DEFCON track agenda can really screw with your opponent if they aren't expecting it (I was even surprised by it!).

There are a few cards that are good to know about in advance but no "must know" game-changers like in TS.

Mini TS.Gran juego de mayorías. 
Cartas de objetivo al principio de la ronda que le dan un punto de faroleo divertido.
Hay que estar pendiente del Defcon en cada acción para no provocar 3a Guerra Mundial.

El epílogo esta muy bien pensado ya que no siempre pones una carta del rival.
Para lo corto que es tiene mucha chicha. 

El punto negativo es que al igual que el TS lo veo algo abstracto aun teniendo cartas de evento.  Al final estas pendiente de los efectos de las cartas sin prestar atención a la historia.

Recomendable. No conozco juego que ofrezca tanto en tan poco tiempo

13 DAYS wird hier und da als Mini-Ausgabe von TWILIGHT STRUGGLE gehandelt. Nun habe ich TS bis dato nie gespielt und politisch/historisch verankerte Spiele wie FRIEDRICH und MARIA sind mir nicht das nächste Genre. Bei 13 DAYS ist es vor allem die knappe Spielzeit von max 45 Minuten, die mir gefällt und die sich auch thematisch deckt: 13 Tage sind nicht viel, um die Welt an den Abgrund zu befördern. Auch dies kann man in 13 DAYS gut nachspielen und -fühlen. Schnell bewegt man sich mit seinen Defcon-Markern am Rande der finalen Eskalation zum Nuklearkrieg. Spielerisch ist 13 DAYS ein taktisches Setz- und Bluffspiel, das tatsächlich eine ernste Polit-Atmosphäre aufkommen lässt. Dazu trägt die nüchterne, sachbezogene, informative Gestaltung bei, welche die Geschichte der Kubakrise inmitten des Kalten Krieges nacherzählt. 13 DAYS ist ein riskanter Kampf der Kräfte, der einen als Spieler schonmal zucken lässt, wenn man nicht rücksichtslos einen möglichen Nuklearkrieg in Kauf nimmt. Die Scheissegalhaltung des Um-jeden-Preis-gewinnen-Müssens entlarvt in 13 DAYS seine ganze Verachtung. Wir sind seit damals wieder nah dran an am roten Knopf. 13 DAYS darf uns auch zu denken geben. Das macht es gut.

Here is a game that I was interested in trying but wasn't really seeking out.  So I was happy when Brendon brought it over! The story goes that it is a Twilight Struggle Lite that can be played in 45 minutes, and boy was it exactly that!  A lot of familiar feelings from Twilight Struggle - which is nice - because they add some good tension to the game and force some pretty thinky hand management stuff.  I'm actually surprised that GMT doesn't get some sort of royalty for this game existing as enough of it was pure facsimile.  But the different stuff, especially how DEFCON is handled, is a good, driving force of 13 Days. It would have been truly great if the event deck was larger so that there was more variety with the cards, but other than that this is a smart, little two-player game that really does give a basic TS feeling in a small package. Would never say it replaces the bigger game (I don't think anyone would!) but everything it did to create a smaller-package experience, it did right.

A streamlined & short Twilight Struggle? Not really, but the overall game mechanics & theme strike a similar vein and satisfy the same itch if there's less time. TW of course is the king for this type of game (& cold war theme). 13 Days also feels similar in mechanics to 1960: The Making of the President, and is more accessible because it is shorter- but 1960 is more aesthetically pleasing. That being said, this is a definite keeper due to the quick playtime. I only wish the aesthetics were less plain looking & evoked more theme.

I haven't played Twilight Struggle, but I feel no need to after this game. It's fast, intense and full of mind games. The asymmetry is fun and I love the way the card factions force you to help your opponent. The limit on influence cubes and the cost of placing them make for an intriguing puzzle. I always enjoy alternate victory/loss conditions and this is probably the game I've played where the alternate condition is most equally likely to be fulfilled as the normal end condition. 

That said, the game just doesn't scratch an itch for me that other similar games do. I don't know why, but it doesn't feel as rewarding to do well in this game. There's always this thought in the back of my mind that if I do well, it's only because they drew cards of my factions or because I tricked them into thinking an objective is more/less important than it was, not because I played well.

Components: good game board, the cards are too thin
Complex: easy to teach

Length: a bit more than 30 mins
Opinion: comparison with twilight struggle just in the theme and the play of cards using the event or command points, beside that it is a different game.
You play cards trying to dominate 9 different battlegrounds and control your 3 defcons in just 3 rounds for a length of around 30 mins. There is tension all over the game, the defcon is a risky zone, giving a good amount of points, but could make you loose the game.
As previously said, you play cards for the event or command points (nothing new here), and, in case the event is from your opponent, this can play it, but it is done in a very elegant way. The rules are really easy (small rulebook with 16 pages, where 8 of them are an example of play) and the difficult of the game comes with the players. I love lately these games where the rules are easy and there is lot of interaction between players

Has the feel of Twilight Struggle, but enough differences to be its own game, and I've rated it on that basis, not as a TwS surrogate.  Still, it gives you a TwS-like 'fix' in only 30-45 minutes.

RATING: 8
Twilight Struggle in 45 minutes is the billing here and the designers have certainly borrowed freely from the older game all the way down to including the equivalent of the notorious Red Scare/Purge card. However this is a tense guessing and bluffing game that builds nicely to Turn 3 where you typically have six things you need to do with your four cards. My only criticism is that the connection between theme and mechanism on the cards is quite weak. Why does a card called 'Strategic Balance' allow you to place influence in the Atlantic? OK, this is just cosmetic, but CDGs derive their atmosphere from their cards, which is why TS works as well as it does. There's certainly merit in a CDG filler and kudos to the designers for occupying a design space no-one else has thought of. A great little game for the playing time.

Not your average two player area control game...the card play is very interesting and makes the game super tense. Every action you take feels like a compromise and sometimes helps your opponent more than you.  The multiple paths to victory(or defeat) force you to be flexible with your strategy. Plays in 30ish min but is satisfying. Excellent game.

Truly "Twilight Struggle in 30 minutes." A simple area control zero sum game. Expands on TS' DEFCON track by making it a focus on scoring. This results in aggressive play and a built-in risk/reward system as players jockey to maximize points while staying below the NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION line.

Fun, fast playing card game. Maybe a bit simplistic but probably has to be for this length. There is some opportunity for clever cardplay but sometimes the luck of the draw can bite you. But again for a game that lasts 45 minutes it's not bad at all. And it is possible to back yourself into a corner such that your opponent can push you around and give you only bad options. The purple battlegrounds not being worth points in general but giving special abilities was an interesting twist, and the possibility for an instant loss is really cool because it's what gives you the ability to bully your opponent if they don't manage it well. So while it's a bit simpler than I'd usually prefer, there's a good amount of game in this small package.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2016)

13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is an ok to good game. It is very similar in many ways to Twilight Struggle, but it is much lighter and quicker. I would say it has a light-medium weight and its playtime is around 45 minutes.

The rules are relatively easy to teach, you can do it under 15 minutes.

The game components and art are adequate, but nothing of note.

The theme doesn’t do anything for me, but I know many people enjoy it and you do feel it through the game.

The decisions needed to play are very interesting and non-obvious. 13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is lot deeper than its short playtime would make you believe. It is a tense game, no question about it, and I enjoyed it a lot while I was playing it. All of these are positives for me, however, my desire to play the game again is rather low and I don’t know why! I should love it, perhaps this isn’t my kind of game (the same thing happens to me with Twilight Struggle, I recognize it is a great design but I almost never want to play it, I think it has to do with the CDG nature of it, I need to think more about this). 

Bottom line, 13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a solid game, but perhaps it isn’t a game for me. My desire to play the game again is low, so I already sold my copy of the game. You can describe it as Twilight Struggle lite and I prefer to play 13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis over its big brother.

This is a game I was looking forward to playing and was mildly disappointed.  It's a solid game, but I didn't feel immersed.  I know [thing=12333][/thing] uses an area control mechanic, but here it just didn't feel right.  I moved cubes to garner prestige, but I didn't feel like Kennedy or Krushchev.  I would never refuse a game.  Solid mechanics, but  if I am going to play a two-player game similar to this, I'd rather play a straight up war game.  

I will give it a few more tries, but it may be up for trade shortly.

RATING: 7
Twilight Struggle light - it really works. As in its inspiration, cards can be played as invest or for events. The tug-of-war is condensed into a single track with the looming threat of causing WW III throughout the game. Competent play should be much easier to achieve than in TS with a handful of decisive cards for each side. It won't have the longevity of TS but offers enough variation. It adds a bluffing element as the opponent is given an indication of three potential agendas, his opponent might aim for this round. One of it will be the true agenda to rise in the esteem of the world.

A good game for players enjoying dense tug-of-wars. There's no relevant topographic boardplay which is a slight drawback but you can't have everything in 30 minutes.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Solid first impression as this is an interesting "thinky" filler where one really has to watch the you lose conditions and manage avoiding them while winning the prestige battle by the end of the game. The limitations on the cube quantity also quickly comes into play and investing heavily in one or two locations may come back to bite you. There are definitely similarities to Twilight Struggle, but this is much more streamlined and simplified.

Quite light: some guessing of our opponent's objective.

Relatively fast game, which makes it convenient to play.

The rules are not completely convenient as a reference. They could also help players by documenting which rules are important because they are not repeated anywhere, and which rules can instead be found on the cards.

I would like it better if I could really link historical events with the mechanics of each card.

I like it that it borrows from Twilight Struggle's "brinkmanship" mechanics. It misses the tension brought about by the scoring cards, though, the richness and perks offered by the space race, and the spatial aspect of the game (where influence cannot be placed in the middle of nowhere just like this).

RATING: 7
Twilight Struggle remains a gold standard of boardgames, but it's big and long and intimidating, so folks have tried to make versions of it that are a little more manageable. 1955 was one such creature, and wasn't bad, though it simplified things a little too much. Now there's 13 Days, a game focusing on the Cuban Missile Crisis, which also looks to shrink TS down into a more agreeable footprint.

It does a pretty good job of this. You're never unaware of the game which inspired this, but it still manages to also do its own thing. As is appropriate to the theme, you always feel inches away from a nuclear war, and it's super easy to get into a position where you can be maneuvered or bumble into doing so. There's also an element where you will want to pull out of locations, both to lower your defcon and to get precious precious cubes back.

Excellent game.  Highly thematic, short, includes bluffing and deduction, exciting, surprising, and with many strategic and tactical options.  I will trade the "epicness" of Twilight Struggle (a veeery long game) for the speed, excitement, and double-guessing of 13 Days any time.  Definitely one of the best in its class, kudos to the designers for being able to distill the game mechanics and theme, and add the brinkmanship.  It's a game of chicken played over the nuclear button, where the winner is the one that is best at misdirection and brinkmanship.

Great thematic mechanism which takes ONE of the most interesting aspects of Twilight Struggle and combines it with a relatively new aspect: the connection of agenda-scoring with SEVERAL defcon-Tracks. The result is a very concentrated and fast game focussed on sometimes nervewracking risk-managing.
People who know Twilight Struggle got it really fast and liked the lighter touch which even allows two games on a normal evening during the week. For more casual gamers 13 DAYS offers the fascinating cardplay-tension of TS without the game-weight. To make it short: Of 4 people who played the game with me everybody liked it a lot and I like it too!

Wow I played this with my wife and it was some experience. I just watched her face go through all the pain and frustration that was my first (and only so far) game of Twilight Struggle. She really didn't like 13 Days and explained that she hated having to give me actions as it took away the feeling of completing something for herself. The constant to and fro was not to her liking and we were only both saved from what was for her, and consequently me, a very frustrating experience by total nuclear armageddon initiated by us both at the end of the second round. Never thought a nuclear war would be so welcome!

Well that was my first and only play last month. But I have played it probably about five times since and I am happy to say that I absolutely love this game. It delivers a deliciously tense and concentrated gameplay experience in its short 30 minutes game time. I have never played Twilight Struggle again after my first experience and I cannot imagine I would enjoy going through this tense decision process constantly for 3 hours again .... but ... but .... in this short 30 minute game it is a delight!

I will write more up next month but for now if this game sounds like it is up your street then it definately will be. It is great and one I hope to play for a long time yet. For me it is up there alongside Wir sind Das Volk. Well probably a bit behind in terms of gameplay but when you factor in the 30 minute play time, for me this delivers an equally enjoyable tense and thematic experience.

UPDATE:

Liking this game more and more as I play it. It does what it does fantastically well in the short length of time the game lasts. 

It creates tension through several mechanics (cardpay choices, hidden agendas, defcon track and the possibility of nuclear armageddon - well if that isn't enough to create some tension for you then nothing will!)

The mechanic of either playing cards for events or "influence points" with the option of your opponent choosing if their event occurs when you play their colour card for points, for me, with the length of this game, works fantastically well. I really don't enjoy have to constantly make these decisions over a longer time frame (as in Twilight Struggle), but here the decision making is a sweet enjoyable delight.

A game I hope to play a lot more of.

Streamlined Card-Driven Area-Control Game with Cold War Topic which packs a whole lot of tension in a small-time frame. The most amazing part is, that you can get newbies on the fence to "wargaming" á la Twilight Struggle into it. But even as someone who is used to Cards with the Action-Event mechanic this one is a blast. I love my Special Wooden Box of Twilight Struggle but 13 Days will be played more often because life is unfortunately full of other duties. If you ask yourself if it is different enough to justify a buy i would say 100% yes. It is amazing how you can condense the typical tense-feeling of a TS-Round of 3 hours in such a short timeframe. I will never regret this purchase. This one will be a permanent companion.

Excellent game, fantastic design. Feels very Twilight Struggle-esque, not only thematically but in planning ahead and attempts to second guess opponents objectives and to try to avoid making your own objectives too obvious too early in the turn. Love how it replicates the tension of the crisis by forcing players to raise DEFCON tracks "high enough" to show they aren't weak or won't back down, yet not too high to cause global thermonuclear war and lose them the game. Potentially lacks long term replayability due to it's short, condensed nature, but this was never the purpose of the game anyway.

This small package game packs a punch in the way of tight decisions. Playing in 45 minutes, i think more people will find this more accessible than Twilight Struggle. Not as deep or epic, but the Defcon track is tight and tense the whole way, inducing a little bit of Analysis Paralysis i found, just enough that has you double checking yourself to make sure you steer clear of accidentally starting nuclear war. This game is a stressful struggle, but a nice historical thriller.

Really cool idea, want to like it, and my 11 year old boy grokked quickly enuf on the first play to thrash dad, but ...

By mid game we found we were just playing for the defcon track, which while I'm sure this is legitimate, it didn't really make full use of the game atmospherics and theme. I mean, the game has a neat map and neat cards, and what seems to be a competitive board game, but we ended up dueling over forcing the opponent's defcon ratings up.

I think we will try our next game without the mandatory increase in the defcon track each turn. That might make players go easily on the high influence cube cards, for fear of nuke war, but keep war in the realm of unlikely. Then we can focus on playing the game on the board and with the cards.

I'm sure it will be just as fun.

In this game you play 12 cards in about 30 minutes and get an interesting and thematic cold-war experience.  For such a small game, it is packed full of gaming goodness: it's got area control, bluffing and misdirection, tactical card-play and push-you-luck/risk mitigation.  The design is exceptional, but it's not quite an '8' for me because the luck of the draw seems more pronounced than I like for a top tier game.

This game is pure elegance: it takes 52 cards, a few wooden cubes and a map to create a game with surprising depth. The dynamic between Influence and the DEFCON tracks is brilliant and adds alot of suspense and tough decisions. The only downside is that sometimes you will feel like you don't score alot even though you played well. But the game is played in under an hour and the theme makes for time well spent!

RATING: 7
Feels almost like the micro game version of Twilight Struggle. That isn't to take away from 13 Days, but it is a very simplified version of Twilight Struggle with some very tense decisions. I like that there is always a tug-of-war between the players and the Def Con Track. The only area where the game feels a bit lacking is with the actual cards. The cards and their events aren't nearly as interesting as the game 13 Days takes its inspiration from. Granted, you're really just adding and removing influence, with the occasional event that lets you move around the Def Con Track. Because of this, I don't want to play this over Twilight Struggle very often, unless time is a factor. The one area where this game excels over TS is the constant tension. The game can end at any time in TS, but experienced players won't get caught off guard that often unlike with 13 Days.

UPDATE: As much as I enjoy this game while I play it, I have little desire to bring it to the table again. I would much rather play Twilight Struggle or 1960 if given the choice.

[b]13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8/10 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]13 Days was one of the hits of the year in terms of teaching new folks games; at least three people I taught this to ended up buying their own copies. I've enjoyed every play of 13 Days which holds up well to repeated play considering the small size of the map and the limited number of action/agenda cards. 13 Days is also one of the few games I've played that manages to create a truly engaging, 2p area control game. If I had one minor niggle with the game it would be when one player draws two of the same agenda cards, this can be a major disadvantage to that player since your opponent will have a much easier time blocking your plans. By the same token, victory tastes even sweeter when you manage to overcome what may seem to be a bad card draw in terms of action and/or agenda cards.

As an aside, if you play a lot of 3/4p games I'd recommend checking out [thing=220792][/thing] which I actually enjoy a bit more. There are additional considerations you need to make during The Expanse that ratchet up the tension compared to 13 Days.

*While I really enjoy 13 Days, no one in my house was interested in playing and since a lot of my gaming buddies ended up buying copies I ended selling my copy.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]This is an excellent game, the more I play the more the nuances of game play open up. 13 Days really requires a bunch of plays to really get a feel for it and you know how the board and Defcon track can be manipulated. Yes there is randomness in the cards you draw, but even if you get hosed it is fun trying to just hang in there and see if you can pull out an improbable win or even a draw. The game is so quick that you can easily play a few sessions in a row, I've had the game end in 15 minutes with a first round Defcon loss and instead of being frustrated you want to go at it again. 

13 Days is the second game, [thing=167513][/thing] being the other, I've played that manages to make area control work in a 2p game. Mind you both games play quite differently, 13 days being the more complex. If you are able to get 2p games to the table I think 13 Days will appeal to you, whether it be the card play, historical aspect or area control there is a lot to sink your teeth into. This rating will probably go up as I continue to play and more of nuances in strategy open up as I learn the different cards.[/i]

The rules could use some work and the card quality is sub par. It's rather flimsy. Sleeved it's fine, but really...for the price they could have provided better card stock. It's literally a small board, a deck of playing cards, cubes and 6 cardboard chits. I think the gameplay stands up for itself, but I am disappointed in the card quality.

Also, sidenote but any of the defcon agenda cards should mention JUST the defcon dominance, not the influence cubes. Literally replace the word for influence cubes to defcon track.

Inspired by Twilight Struggle, and with some obvious similarities, this is a much quicker and therefore more readily playable game.

Twilight Struggle in 45 Minutes. After one play, a solid 7 for me. I'm not entirely sure how much you can bluff here - playing only 4 cards per round is not much; I suspect knowing the game better helps in this matter, but the first game left me with a "hey, like 2-player El Grande"-feeling. I will surely play this more often to get a better idea for the Events and the DEFCON track - hopefully my wife will support me here :meeple:

RATING: 7
I'm a huge fan of modern-day historical/political themes so my ears pricked up when I first read about 13 Days, even if I was a little sceptical of the 'Twilight Struggle in 45 minutes' tag. In reality, the comparison to Twilight Struggle ends with the borrowed event card/ops points mechanism (and why not borrow such a brilliant mechanic?) and the game stands on its own merits. 

The designers have done a great job of evoking the theme not just through the event cards and historical notes, but also through the dynamics of the game. The crisis was all about brinksmanship, neither side wanting to back down, but neither really wanting to start an all-out war. The game's Defcon rules capture this perfectly -- indeed, I spent more of my game worrying about how to avoid triggering holocaust than I did about beating my opponent.

A game it reminds me of a little mechanically-speaking is Aton, with its multiple area-majority arenas, periodic scoring and abrupt sudden-death conditions. But 13 Days adds a satisfying layer of theme that Aton lacks.

Feels like Twilight Struggle Express - plays so fast, but difficult decisions and a tug of war with adding and removing pieces to avoid triggering nuclear war. The dynamics of Kennedy and Kruschev really come through in the feeling of the game mechanics, but you don't need to know the history to enjoy the game as a simple area control game.  My only complaint is that the Agenda deck has duplicates, so it's possible for a player to draw 2 out of the 3 Agendas that are the same, and because you may already be losing on a DefCon track so Agenda cards for that track will only hurt you, that will remove any choice you have about which Agenda to choose.  I think it would have been better with just 12 agendas, no duplicates, or created more complex agendas that have major and minor target areas for full and half prestige points or something like that.

Was hyped as a shortened version of Twilight Struggle but it really only bears passing similarities, mainly through the card play and the need to play your opponents events when you play cards for actions.

Backed KS. GREAT game.  Tension on every  card play, and you have to think ahead.  No point lead is ever 100% safe.

Definitely a lighter version of Twilight Struggle. Some of the historical flavour in a shorter game with easier rules. It's reasonably fun to play. Comes in a nice portable box size. Doesn't quite have the same card choice tension as Twilight Struggle though. Several event cards have little impact and are an easy play at certain times. There's a fair chunk of cube management, but none of the risk and uncertainty of TS coups. I'm perfectly happy with the Undermining alternative to the Space Race though.

Pity the rules and cards weren't properly clarified and edited. We played correctly first time around with a little head scratching, but it needed a trip to the FAQ to be sure we were doing it right. Besides the confusing terminology there's too much open to interpretation on some cards to rate the game higher.

Happy to keep this one around. A nice size to take on a holiday and doesn't fill up an entire evening. It'll hit the table often enough because we like games with a good historical setting.

A fun, easy and interesting little brother game to Twilight Struggle and 1989: Dawn of Freedom. As the bgg description says, it can scratch that Twilight Struggle itch in 45 minutes or less, which is pretty neat. Also worth noting is that there are no dice rolls in 13 Days, which will appeal to all the luck-averse gamers out there. The historical booklet on the Cuban Missile Crisis was a nice touch, and it is something that all future historical games should include. Since this is a short game with a limited card pool, it is possible that the replay value may suffer, but only time will tell if that is actually going to be the case.

Cute two player game on the Cuban Missile Crisis. As many have said, it's a mini Twilight Struggle. While it lacks that game's thick thinky history it has its own charms. There's a really clever mechanism where you often want to raise your defcon to score prestige (look tough to your own country) but if you go too far... bye bye world. The game has perhaps a bit too much randomness (the wrong cards at the wrong time can really hurt) but it plays fast so I don't mind. I also really like the guessing game you have to play. Is he really going for Cuba or is it a feint?
I don't know how long this game will last for me, I'm still exploring it. However, right now I'm reasonably impressed. It probably won't go above an 8 but I doubt if it'll sink below a 7 either. A nice clever quick game.

Basically a short and sweet version of Twilight Struggle. There's nice balance with wanting to avoid nuclear war, so you can't go too crazy on any one track, plus there's a little bluffing with which agendas you set. You're a bit more confined with your cards, but that just makes it that much more challenging to play. Overall, I really enjoyed my first play. I think it might be slanted a bit to the USSR side, but I need to play more games to be sure.

I love historical games & the cold war (Cuban missile crisis being a part of it) is an interesting topic to me.

The game itself has a Twilight Struggle vibe to it. The influence supply pool is limited, so rather than constantly adding influence to battlegrounds you sometimes have to pull some back back which is a nice twist. 

Juggling the 3 DEFCON tracks is also neat, as they are affected both by the amount of influence cubes added or removed from a battleground, objectives, and automatically increase round-over-round thus forcing some interesting decisions onto the players (i.e. you might have to pull back from regions just to bring one of the DEFCON levels down).

The game doesn't replace Twilight Struggle (one of my favourite games!) but it's a very solid design & plays in abut 1/3 of the time. 

If you're a cold war junkie and enjoy historical games, buy this game (and Twilight struggle) immediately!

An interesting area majority and bluffing game. Both players get three agendas to choose one from - the other player knows which 3 his opponent had to choose from but not which one was actually choosen, which leads to the bluffing part.

Only the choosen agendas are scored at the end of the round. At the same time the players try not to cause nuclear war, since you loose the game if you are the cause of a nulear war.

The game is driven by multiuse cards, where you can either remove or place some cubes anywhere (though if you are 'greedy' you'll increase your defcon level which is the cause for nuclear war, so later you'll have to remove cubes with those cards to lower the defcon level) or you can use the event of the card (if the card is neutral or for your faction). But during the game you are often stuck with cards from the opposite faction, which you can still use for the cube part of the card, BUT your opponent get the option to perform the event. So using those cards wisely to ensure the free event you grant your opponent won't make to much of a difference is crucial.

The theme is really incredibly integrated into the game, at all time you want to flex your muscles to ensure you get as much prestige as possible, but you are walking a really thin line with the defcon level and nuclear war is a constat thread to prematurely end the game.

Very tight, tense with lots of give-and-take, back-and-forth, bluffing and surprises. Pretty straight-forward rules/concepts, too. One of the best 2p games I've played, though I can understand the historical setting not being as magnetic. Really like the dual use cards for either influence or event - if you play your opponent's card for influence, they an still trigger the event if they want! This is an excellent game.

I'm about 30 plays into this game.
At first, this game doesn't look like much, but once you get into it and make sure you are playing by all the rules correctly, it's actually a really great 2 player game.  It's very much a light-weight version of twilight struggle, but with some interesting twists.  It also will appeal to many people due to the play time being 30-45 minutes.  You can play 2-3 games back to back in a session, instead of one massive twilight struggle game that might not be going your way.  In comparison to twilight struggle, one of the most interesting differences is that you only have 17 points (cubes) of political influence and once you use them all up, you have to start taking turns spending "command" points to actually pick up cubes.  There are 3 defcon tracks, so you can play 3 games of chicken at once, and this game also has random-semi-hidden objectives for each player per round, which may include having a lower defcon on one of the tracks and rewards you for getting closer to the brink than your opponent!

RATING: 6
Distillation of Twilight Struggle that, like most attempts at "X in 25% of the time", loses a lot along the way. One of the best things about Twilight Struggle is the genuine, utterly thematic knife-edge tension provided by its multiple victory conditions.

13 Days is a much lighter bit of area control, with I think a fairly significant luck-factor in the cards, but what I find most annoying is the lack of theme. Oh, cards look like historical events, but the abstract nature of the board makes them hard to see as more than vague gestures at setting.

But the most frustrating thing is that 13 Days' tension primarily comes from its three DEFCON tracks representing different spheres of power. The game ends in nuclear war if a player lets one of these tracks creep up far enough or, more easily, allows all three to reach the middle danger zone. This is a loss only for the triggering player, so a big part of the strategy is, basically, to push your opponent into a war footing because only they lose. This does not strike me as a particularly appropriate historical model.

If you disregard the thematic trappings entirely, it's a reasonable design with perhaps a bit too much swinginess in the card draw. Unfortunately, it invites comparisons with much, much better games, and so it's always going to be 45 minutes of thinking that you should be playing Twilight Struggle instead.

Great fun filler game.  It's missing the intensity of Twilight Struggle, but you'd never be able to replicate that in a game of this size.  What the designers created here is a fun 2-player filler that can be played in 20 minutes or less while maintaining a bit of "gaming-stress".

As soon as I heard the theme, I knew that I wanted to check out this game.  Once I saw the mechanics and design, I knew that I wanted to back this game.  Now that David Janik Jones has played it and given his thumbs up, I know that I have made an excellent choice!

This is a theme that never gets its' own treatment.  If it is covered, it's part of a bigger game and becomes just a sideshow.  Now you can play one of the most impactful political events in the last 75 years. 

Now that our relationship with Cuba is changing, in another 20 years the younger generations will have all but forgotten, or worse, never been told about the Crisis.  This game may be the best device to teach this pivotal event in the future.

Rating could rise to an 8 with more plays. After one learning game, I like it! It definitely pays homage to Twilight Struggle; however, it's much shorter and admirably blunter in its nastiness -- almost swingy, but in a way that feels appropriate considering the play-time. I do miss the scope and subtleness from full-blown TS, but you can't have everything, I realize. That said, 13 Days blazes its own trail in a few areas, notably the tense management of multiple DefCon tracks, a limited number of influence cubes, and an end-game secret scoring phase. I'd really like to play this a few more times to develop a feel for the deck and for the strategy, and to determine if the puzzle presented is inspiring or staid.

This is a fantastic and tense 2-player strategy game. Really captures the feel of Twilight Struggle but boils it down to a game that should take you less than 45 minutes. For a game where you really are only taking 12 actions, there are several agonizing decisions to be made. Great game.

RATING: 8.5
This is a MUCH better game than I was expecting.  I think it would be more aptly described as Twilight Struggle Short rather than Twilight Struggle Lite, because it really does retain a lot of the decision tension of its ancestor.  Sure, it feels less epic and flavourful, but the tradeoff of having a similar cold war tug of war in 30 minutes is very appealing.

I also like that you don't need to memorize the event cards to be competitive.  They're much more like El Grande in terms of flexibility and abstraction yet doesn't feel like a cube pusher.

This is a tremendous, tense, duplicitous standoff. I can't believe my Dad beat me by forcing nuclear war. I never imagined a kid who lived through the actual Cuban Missile Crisis would resort to such measures.

First play impression: Wow, this has killed Twilight Struggle.

My own experience with TS: I got the game years ago and although I've started playing it a few times over the years, the games have always been aborted because they just drag on for too long. I do like the cardplay mechanic and the area control, though.

So now we have a 30 minute version that focuses only on the cardplay and area control and I'm sold.

13 Days has a much smaller footprint, far less setup, and very little rules overhead. I don't know the size of the board, but it's smaller than most standard boards and works perfectly for this game. The setup consists of just setting out a couple of decks of cards and a few tokens. The rules are very simple. You just explain the cards, the scoring, and the overall round structure, and you're ready to start.

I also like the simplicity of the card text in 13 Days. In TS you would usually have a whole paragraph and you had to keep looking back and forth between the card and the giant board to see if you meet all of the conditions. The card text in 13 Days is more straightforward, usually with just a sentence or two.

Can't wait to play again.

Update: Played again, it's still great. No real insight here, it's just fun to play.

I did have some concern about the possible amount of luck (the same applies to Twilight Struggle). But it seems like everything is perfectly balanced to prevent that from being an issue. I had one round where every card in my hand was either neutral or an event for my side. It seemed like an instant-win for the round, but that wasn't so. This is because a lot of the events are really situational and the cards only provided 1-2 command actions each. So instead of having an incredible round I just had an okay round.

This game is just fun to play. Every hand of cards is like a puzzle: how can I play these to meet my agenda while also competing with my opponent's possible agendas, while also not causing an instant-loss from nuclear war. Very good.

It fulfills its goal of being a TS light perfectly. It doesn't have the epic scope or the big feel of two massively different superpowers but it does have all the tension. I like how bluffing plays a big part and the fact that you need to know the cards to be able to play well. While the two games have the same setting of the Cold War they have different themes. TS is about being present, not letting the opponent control too much of the world and perhaps even controlling areas yourself at critical junctions in the game. 13 Days' theme is brinkmanship - how do you push the envelope so much that you come out on top but not so much that you trigger a nuclear war.

Really nice little game.  I like this better than Twilight Struggle.  I feel like there is competition for more areas in this than in TS.  In Twilight Struggle it can be quite obvious what is going to score.  This has more room for bluffing.  The brinksmanship in this game is also awesome.  To score you have to push yourself towards an auto loss victory condition.  Finding the right balance is tough.  A lovely knife's edge to navigate.

The established description "Twilight Struggle lite" is pretty accurate. I'd even go as far as to say 13D is every bit as tense and thematic in a fraction of the playtime, and of course much friendlier to new players.

One cannot replace the other, though, and 13D's replayability may eventually suffer from its small card count and too specific theme.

Distills the TS/1960 gameplay down into a nice package that doesn't overstay its welcome.

I did, however, enjoy the small informational booklet included.

I have not played Twilight Struggle, so I don't have the basis for comparison that some others do.  However, I find that I very much enjoy the way the secret agendas, card play, and area control all come together in a tense, tight package.

I think some people are wondering if such a small deck of cards will limit replayability, but I feel that the game will only improve as the players get more and more acquainted with the cards.

Condensed two player card driven strategy game centered around the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Try to gain the upper hand in scoring and achieving a personal objective condition by timing event cards and stashing points for the aftermath.  The catch is both players are trying to out maneuver the other while avoiding the start of World War III by managing the nuclear, political, and world opinion DEFCON levels.  I cannot think of many examples of games that require the simultaneous common goal of avoiding a negative scoring condition.  More games should explore this dynamic.

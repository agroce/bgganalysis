See above - I'd probably love it if it ever hit the table again.

RATING: 5
PROS:
*) Interesting concept
*) Some "ah, I didn't know that" effects

CONS:
*) I found that there's kind of a critical chain length, where players will usually start to doubt the correctness of all dates in the chain (and will often be right). Somehow, this critical chain length often reaches the same player during a single game. Because of that, it's not really a fair game - depending where you sit, you might have no real chance of winning (except if you really know all the cards and can truly pinpoint all the dates).

Doesn't really get me, despite of my fondness of games involving guessing historical dates.

Can sometimes run a little long, but is usually fairly entertaining until it gets there.

IMHO: Anno Domini is one of the best games ever!
Sex&Crime is one of the first sets of the game and probably one of the best :-)

Just not my type of game, but my wife is a history nerd, so it stays.

RATING: 6
Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it just takes forever. Some of the events are so strange that hardly anyone can tell in which millennium it happened. The theme of the box is only a very rough description of the events.

The fun really depends on whether or not you're into the subject, i enjoyed playing Sex & Crime & loathed Inventions.. so if you like casual games with an educational approach make sure you pick a topic that you're interested in.

My wife is scarily good at this, although she doesn't know much about European history (she is from Taiwan). This is a good game in all its incarnations, but somewhat too long, I guess.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

Anno Domini is one of the very few games my wife also likes to play. So thats the very main reason I own a couple of it. I also think its fun, but the fun begins when you play with at least four players (five or six are even better). You should also make sure that you don't have an "expert" in the round (played the Natur topic two times with a biologist teacher... no fun! ;o) ).

Just takes way too long for what it is. As a real filler, it would be much better.

I like all the Anno Domini games. This might be my favorite version though. Some of the events are hilarious or simply unbelievable. It is definitely easier to get people to play this version rather than all the others. I wonder why. xD 
Of course you might have a better chance if you are good in history, but a lot of those events are guessable for everyone alike. It helps if you are good at bluffing and judging other players ;)

Order events by timeline. A little dry. Sex & Crime is what most people like to talk about, but of course not any crime is interesting or funny...

This has lots of choices, is fun to play and runs very smoothly. Something that 5 or 10 years ago I would have bought in a flash, Now, I guess it’s not sufficiently different from other games I have - and I have a horrible suspicion that in a 5 player game, the third and fourth players are at a distinct disadvantage but this may be doing the designer an injustice

130929 My initial impressions have held up over the past year.  Its a nice heavier euro.  Not sure if I'll ever love it but it seems like a really nice balanced game.  For now it will hover around the 6/7 level but after a play it could crater down to a 3/4 if I don't enjoy that play instance.

121231 Most likely as complicated a game as I'd enjoy playing.  I don't tend to like the multiple resources that all give powers and VP type games (ie agricola, etc) and this is most likely at the upper limits of what I would reasonably tolerate.  I suspect my 7 rating will go down over time and/or additional plays.

For some reason a lot of people find it difficult to grasp some aspects of this game (especially market action); played 3, 4 and 5-player games; enjoyed 5-player the least. Tend to like it more & more + find new strategies with increasing nujber of plays.

1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Hard decisions, tense, with good elements of engine building. Somewhat quick turns. The market can really keep things interesting, since it is the primary way to maximize money return.
DISLIKE: Drab theme, can be tough to get to the table.

OVERALL: Good, solid game. First play with 5 new players was too rough for me, 4 or 3 is probably the best number of players.

I really enjoyed this latest offering from Mac Gerdts. This time out, the 'additional' actions cost more than just a coin - they cost one of your important assets: a ship. It makes for a more limited game and is better for it. Also, I really like the smooth phasing and ramping of costs - I even think the market works just fine. I imagine this game doesn't offer too many strategy lanes, but still, it is very tight and smart. Certainly true that experienced players will lose because of seating order or any one (minor) misplay. It's a knife walk. Perhaps too tight? Need more plays to tell.

Sometimes, when playing board games, I wish I could be a little bit more like Peter Pan. You know, with the blink of an eye I could move to another world. A world where the elements of fantasy come to life, where everything is possible and ideas have wings. 
Unfortunately, I am not like Peter Pan. With some games, when someone tries to explain the rules to me, I just get annoyed and wonder what the hell the designer was thinking. And, unfortunately, Navegador is one of those games. So ... you have those little cardboard pieces that you can exchange for little wooden thingies which you can exchange for other cardboard pieces which you can exchange for other wooden thingies which gives you points. Sigh. And all this is a journey to the magical world of ... wait, I KNOW I can remember the theme of the game, if I only try hard enough...
So, once again, I would love to be like Peter Pan, because then games like Navegador would probably start to be fun. Unfortunately, I am more the Captain Hook-type (and age), so this first round of Navagador will probably be my last.

RATING: 6
Really liked it at first but ultimately it falls into the same pit as Cuba, nice game but you have to lock yourself in to a strategy too early with too much penalty for switching, the player who picked the strategy of least resistance wins but this wholly dependent on what the players after you do and their understanding of the game. I want to like it as I enjoy the mechanics but we still have Imperial for true rondel greatness.

For some reason, just doesn't grab me.  My friends love it, I don't.  I feel like the different paths aren't all *that* different.  While you may be pushed or pulled into one strategy or another, you don't always have a lot of control over where you're going with it since other players' actions dramatically affect yours.  Yes, try to plan around this, but that doesn't always work.  Just not for me.

RATING: 7.5
I really like Navegador. While the graphics and components are nice - I especially like how the board looks -, the game-play is where this game shines. This was my first game with the famous rondel mechanic by Mac Gerdts and I immediately fell in love with it. It's just so elegant! I can't believe how many different strategies this mechanism provides from such a limited amount of choices. Turns run really fast and smooth, because of the simplicity of the actions, but the game is still very tense... 

I tried three rondel games at this point and I can say, that this is particularly true in Navegador. You sit there waiting, hoping that the privilege tile or those colonies that you want will still be there when the turn comes back to you. There's a lot of indirect conflict. Taking pieces away from others is really important, but the center of this conflict is the market. Manage to control it at your advantage and you'll really be able to boost your engine and run away with the game. I think this Market mechanism is the best and simplest implementation of this concept in all the games I played so far. 

So, summing up... Even if I don't enjoy Navegador as much as other Rondel games, I still like this game a lot. It's clever, elegant and very fun even if it doesn't hit the table so often. Good job, Mr. Gerdts!

[b]18.12.2014 - after 1 play[/b]
Navegador was one of games high on my Want-To-Play list, probably due to the praise many people give to it. This is my second rondel game (after ANTIKE, which was ok).

The components of the game are not too fancy, neither too bleach, with a nice mix of wooden components (ships/buidings), nicely drawn map and ugly tiles. The theme of territory exploration / colony building goes together wonderful with the gameplay, almost all the actions having a theme association. The rules are easy to learn/teach and after 1-2 turns every thing comes into place.

Gameplay-wise, this game (as other rondel games) consists of small actions played until a final condition is reached (here, the discovery of the Nagasaki territory or the depletion of all the buildings). Although there are many options, the limitations of the rondel make for a game with very little downtime. We played a 5-player game (all the players being new to the game, with only one reading/explaining the rules) in just 2 hours (rules explanation included). 

I liked the ability for combos (encouraged by the Navegador card) and the fact that you can follow different paths to victory. Also, these paths make me wonder if there is some replayabily in this game. I consider this to be an almost perfect information game and I fear that after playing some times, you can find a "winning" solution for the victory. 

Anyway, a good game which I want to play more to try another approach.

Very clean, fast playing rondel game, with  clearly deliminated early-middle-end games. Even at five players there is no downtime, turns play briskly.

Compared to Concordia, there are similarities in the end-scoring building and the Navegador card which accelerates the game flow. Contrary to Concordia all the information is open and the scoring of each player is transparent during play. On the other hand there is no build-up of actions through cards, only the same rondel from the beginning to the end.

The market is a nice addition, and allows a lot of interaction between players. For instance, seat position can be important depending on who is importing/consuming resources.

Very attractive Euro-game! We had some rule issues and decided the following: (1) Navigator can be used before the owner's turn (not anyone's turn), (2) No need to have a colony to process a good. 

In our 5 player game, the game was kind of dull and some players didn't care for it (including hubby). The winner did no navigation or exploration, and stuck with the market strategy (and he found that boring). 

But, I still think this is one of the better Euro-style games with a stronger, better theme than Endeavor and as good as what I remember Cuba to be from a mechanics perspective. The fact that it has a great map, fast and easy game flow, icons as instruction reminders, a quick reference sheet, and the rondel make it all the better. At the very least, the best Portuguese themed game we've played. Tracked on family list (grooven)!

Contrary to what you might think, this is not, in essence, an exploration game: it is far more an economic game. If you want an exploration game, play Entdecker.
This is a very good, and extremely challenging, game.
At first glance, it might appear to be multi-player solitaire, but it's not: everything YOU do has an impact on everyone else, and vice versa. And a winning strategy MUST depend on constant awareness of what your opponents are doing.
For a eurogame, the theme is very well portrayed, not least of which is because of the gorgeous antique map of a board. Well themed, but not immersively themed: you will not feel like a Renaissance age Portuguese explorer, nor even a Portuguese merchant, for that matter. Rather, you will feel remarkably like a 21st century eurogamer playing a reasonably well themed eurogame.
The only real fear I have for this game is the issue of replayability, due to the rondel. Since almost everything in Navegador is open information, will the game become rather scripted with experienced players? And if the players are not experienced, there is much room for analysis paralysis.

Navegador is a rondel game with a tangible sense of direction in the game state. We are heading east, "discovering" colonies and snagging political favors in order to gain the most prestige. The art, setting, and unique VP system sets it apart as a neat game for me. However, the gameplay itself is slightly more bland than some of Gerdts's other rondel games.

The Age of Discovery - what an exciting theme for a game.  Never knowing what's over the horizon, whether your food and fresh water will last until landfall, whether your ship will survive the next storm; finally, the thrill of disovery.  

Forget all that, Navegador is just another low luck euro efficiency game.  Everything is calculable and quite, quite boring.  The rule about automatically losing one and just one ship when exploring uncharted waters says it all for me. It's like Mac Gerdts is at your shoulder the whole time, whispering "It's just a game, it's just a game."

The artwork is quite nice and production quality is good.  The rules seem clear and concise.

Great economic eurogame. Nice looking board with the usual wooden components. The rules are precise and clear.

There is enough player interaction and the game provides a lot of choices to paths to follow.

Very entertaining, fast-playing optimization/economic game with compelling theme and very good art and components. The market price system is especially solid, as demand for raw and processed goods is tracked as a whole, leading to interesting buy/sell dynamics without a lot of fiddliness. Overall the design feels extremely tight -- everything has its role in the play, yet nothing feels cloned.  Hard to imagine a scenario where I wouldn't want to put this on the table. Highly recommended.

Initial 4P play took for-ev-er, around 3 hours.  Light investments in both churches and shipyards made developing the game financially painful, and once players were in a position to end it everyone was drawing down the building stack as they didn't know how far ahead or behind they might be.  I knew I was behind, so I kept slogging.  Lousy game experience there.  I played it again with another 4P group, and it flew by in perhaps 75 minutes.  Much more pleasant.  Easily my second-favorite rondel game I've played, just behind Imperial and distantly ahead of both Hamburgum and Antike.

The game seems interesting, there's lots of different possible strategies to explore, and I was enjoying it in my one play... until the last half hour. The game started to drag immensely because there isn't an easy automatic ending condition, and nobody was in a rush to make the last discovery that ends the game (I felt there wasn't a big enough reward to do so).

I felt the end really ruined the game, which was otherwise pleasant to play.

Ez az első rondellás játék, amit próbáltam. Maga a rondella mechanizmusa nagyon bejött. A játék során egyszer sem éltünk azzal a lehetőséggel, hogy 3-nál többet lépjünk a rondellán, sőt a végén már alig hagytunk ki akciót. 
A szerencse szerepe a gyarmatoknál jelenik meg, nem tudhatjuk, mit rejtenek a lapkák. Látszólag ez elhanyagolható, de a mi partink mégis ezen múlt (1 pont döntött annak a javára, aki a gyarmatlapkákból szerencsésebben húzott). 
Ami tetszett, hogy jól át van hidalva az egyre növekvő távolság a 3 fázissal, ha végig csak 1-eket lépkedhetnénk a hajókkal, unalmassá válna valószínűleg, ez ügyesen ki van küszöbölve. Könnyed, és gyors játék, nem csak gamereknek. Bármikor szívesen játszom vele. Ezek után még inkább érdekel, milyen lehet az Imperial.

The latest in the rondel family series is the game that seems to have the most diversity in paths to victory and balance in the usefulness of rondel spots. Players should be very aware of the plays of neighbours, because diversifying the choices from previous player is preferable, and leeching some of their plays is the ideal way to go.
The production is gorgeous, and the initial rating (7.5) could probably rise with more plays.

RATING: 7
The opening turns feel a bit chaotic as players settle into their strategies. Workable strategies can be based on what the preceding player is doing, so you can leech of how that player affects the market. Once the initial turns are through, the game stabilizes into a fairly procedural mid-game march. The procedure of the mid-game can be interrupted for tactical play (e.g., if a player sees an opening to disrupt an opponent or grab a side-benefit). The end game can drag out ever slightly if there's a player unwilling to take that last explore (or build action) to end the game -- this is exacerbated a bit by the hidden scoring. All that said, it plays smoothly and is fairly satisfying in both table presence and game play. For a pure Euro-style game, it has a decent marriage of game play and theme, too.

However, this is a game that would be rated higher if I played it closer to its release date or if I played it before other more recently released games. Navegador is definitely a well designed game: the rule set is well crafted, the scoring is balanced, and it requires players to find a strategy that works for that play session. Navegador's resource market and well-considered package will get this played sporadically. But I'm not sure I'd consistently play this over other games that are broadly similar (e.g., Concordia, Great Western Trail, Voyages of Marco Polo). You could use this game with players that feel more intimidated by heavier games (e.g., Brass) since the rondel does a good job of simplifying action selection.

Visually stunning!  Unfortunately the gameplay is not as captivating as the gorgeous map.  Basically you need to heavily invest in something and hope that the other players head off in an entirely different direction.  

The random colony payouts can either take the wind right out of ye sails or give ye a handful of treasure.  I wish the spread wasn't as wide as the Indian Ocean.

Not an exploration game, it is actually a light economic game. Enjoyable but not sure if it has a place in my collection. What I most dislike is the lack of direct confrontation- which should have been implemented in a colonial theme. The Portuguese went around pillaging, plundering, and conquering their empire. It wasn't some peaceful trade league. At a minimum optional rules or expansion should be available which make an effort to simulate this aspect of the game. I'm not asking for a military simulation, just an effort to recognize that the colonial empire was gained via warfare. The designers went out of their way to highlight the history - why they they not have a mechanic to simulate this crucial element?

Update: I have increased my rating after further plays. The game actually gets better with more players and I do like the expansion cards.

Update: Unfortunately, this one just doesn't do it for me. You eke out victory points over the course of the game, and unless you spend the time (which drags the game down) to calculate the relative places of the players, the winner is fairly anticlimactic.

Original: Obvious similarities to Imperial, but without the stocks to create shared incentives. Instead, this is done through the management of the market, which tips in two directions for each of the three goods. Players who invest in one side of a good can only make lots of money if another player invests in the other side of the good. Seems to be a number of paths to victory, but they all involve specialization. Four players seems like it would be the best. Three doesn't have as much tension, and five would make the game drag just a bit.

RATING: 7
I liked it, overall.  It's not "never turn down a game"(8), it's better than 'ok'(6), definitely better than 'tolerate it'(5).

The good:  I liked that I felt like I had a decent enough grasp of it after my 2nd or 3rd turn.  So it's easy to learn for the (sort-of) thickness of a euro it is.  It's hard to understate this point, because it did have some economy and depth to it---and I felt like a pro before the halfway point.  That's huge.  I also liked that while it was hard to behave offensively, and switch-up a strategy midgame, it wasn't impossible to find some really worthwhile actions involving the other players.  It was absolutely NOT multi-player solitaire.

The bad:  I have the same problem that I have with a lot of other resource euros.  It will appear, and you can think to yourself that you know what's going on.  Looking closer, there are so many options and things laid before you, I don't see any way you could possibly know.  So why all this facade with the rules when it's 70% knowing what to do, and 30% being in the right place at the right time?  Quite a bit of the strategy depended on knowing what the other players were doing, and planning accordingly.  That's good, and it gives some weight to it being a solid, interactive resource game. However, some of it happens to be finding yourself in the right place at the right time with the right gambits.
------------------------------------
In rating this game, I asked myself, "What would I do differently next game?"  and all I could come up with is maybe not making a costly 'mistake' at the beginning of the game by going exploring my first turn out, and maybe looking to see what the guy ahead of me in turn order found himself doing.  Which is true for most resource games, but with this one in particular, there's more nuances and things that score points for a person to keep track of to really feel any accurate sense of competition with eachother until the very end of the game.  So it's like all the resource management of a good resource euro, but none of the sport of tactical plays purposefully targeting one opponent or another for any reason other than, "hey, they look like they're in the lead".  

Objective game comments:  Overall, a good design that really explained itself and the theme, rondel, and limited ruleset all seemed to tie the game together.  My only knock against it, is there are some nuanced rules that stay hidden because they rarely come up, like selling excess items/workers for money.  

I don't know how they would fix it, but having a score track that updates relatively close to real-time rather than the end of the game seriously would take this 7 into an 8.  The one game I played I think was separated by like 10% between first and last, and knowing whether to extend the game, shut it down, or target another player a little more clearly would have really raised the tension up quite a bit.  This game had all the tools to do each, but it was difficult to deeply read into it.

I realize that there are very few games with a perfect scoring track, but I would like to have some basis of belief to help determine who is ahead, because accurately determining who is ahead in this game is pretty much impossible based on an eyeball of strong plays, etc.  Again, with this one game we were all within a pretty close range of eachother, like 10 points.  Considering it was 126-ish for first, and last might have been like 109, there's no way you could really make an accurate guess as to who to take-down.  Any game I enjoy is one where, from time-to-time, it's best to kick your opponent in the nuts rather than outbuild him.

This is a quality game.  I like Hamburgum for the fast turns on the rondel and approachability.  Navegador has a lot more depth and it won't be nearly as easy to pick up for non-gamers.  For gamers though, this game is better.  My high expectations were met with play number one.

I like it even more after the third play (twice with 4 players and once with 5 players).  I had concerns about the potential for a player to runaway some if they can build up churches early and/or the player(s) to their right set them up for a good economy.  That seemed like less of an issue with 5 players.  We didn't even get to phase 3 in our 5 player game which seemed odd... nobody was exploring.

After five plays, I'm fairly confident that 4 players is the right number for the game; it doesn't develop enough with 5 players.  There can be an issue with how much the player to your right affects your success but that can often be mitigated with good decisions.  I like this game but it isn't one I'll be itching to play every week.

This game has NO down time. It is very stream lined. It usually comes back to my turn before I am ready for it. That is a big plus in a Euro. However, so far I am finding the game a bit dry. Although you can effect other players, this game feels a bit like multi-player solitaire.  I think I am starting to like games with a more direct interaction like the game Lancaster.

RATING: 9
A good meaty economic Euro, my favorite!  I can't say I enjoy any of the other rondel games and frankly a designer that uses it in every game is pretty suspect to me, but Navegador is just really good.  If I had one complaint is that it seems that by the second phase your strategy has pretty much calcified and you are mostly going through the motions.  However, this is a fault of most economic games, though Navegador is a little low on the short term optimization that usually obscures this fault.  Still a great game in my book for now.

RATING: 8
The scoring system clashing with the central game mechanic is what makes this game so fantastic. The central game mechanic obviously being the rondel, forces players to diversify, because they are not able to take the same action multiple times in a row. The scoring system on the other hand favors players specializing in one or two specific areas to maximize the total score. Therefore, the key to winning the game is to find ways around this contradiction.

Brilliant system.

RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy this game. The rondel mechanism keeps the turns flowing very quickly and smoothly. The market dynamics are simple and work perfectly, creating a wonderful balance between producing and selling. The timing decisions about when to pick privileges or when to save up workers are great. Just like Concordia, this game just feels like a classic euro in all respects. The rules are simple, the decisions are fun, and the game play is silky smooth. While most of the setup is static, it still feels like there are several viable options and a large number of point scoring combinations to explore. In addition, you will need to adjust your strategy based on how things are playing out early in the game. Very glad I added this to my collection.

Note: We have played 2 player with Tom Lehmann’s 2 player variant (remove a few colonies) and it seems well balanced and works nicely. I would recommend this.

The best out of Mac Gerdt's pure euros (which includes all his games except imperial). Only one match, in which the shipyard-exploration path seemed a bit too strong, and replayability seemed a bit limited. Still, vastly superior to Princes of Macchu Picchu and Hamburgum and Antike.

Great production, beautiful map.

Pretty fun but long economic game.  I love that you can make the market move up and down (many games only let you hurt the market).  You build a money engine for the first half, then try to get as many points as possible in the second half.  The game feels well balanced... you cannot get a big lead or jump on opponents due to the rondel mechanic.  Also, there's a bit of a race element as your ships march from one side of the board to the other and you try to be the first one to a new region to get better prices.

RATING: 7.3
As a Rondel game fan, I was gonna like this. This one's different from the Antike/Imperial ones though as there's less direct conflict and more exploration. There's a bunch of different "Build" items to buy which act as multipliers for the other actions on the rondel. i.e. when you land on "Ships" you build 1 cheap ship for every shipyard you have purchased from the "Build" action. These also get used in scoring at the end. There's also bonuses for exploring sea regions, founding colomies and so on, this is a good game for picking a strategy no-one else is using and making it work. Best to have a second strategy as well, as just one is not usually enough to win.

Sure, Mac is a shoe-in for my "10" list... (he could literally publish anything at this point and I would gobble it up.)  But this game is AMAZING!  Just like his other games, I _LOVE_ the options and limitations that the Rondel drives the game with.  I _LOVE_ the simple rules combined with _LOTS_ of player turns to yield complex, evolving strategies.  I like keeping my eye on the competition and trying to carve a niche for myself in their leavings.  I like the fact that exploration has benefits, not just for the explorer but those who follow in their wake.  What a masterful design and designer!

Good euro game with interesting action planning system (action wheel on the board) and Navegador tile that is traveling between players and gives one extra sailing action which is very important. 

Game has theme, that's for sure. It is really cool to see how things where working during discoveries era. 

Navegador comes with small book where You can find all information about Portuguese explorers.

If there are no players with decision making problems the game can be played really quickly.

Probably works better with more then 2 players because there is less room for mistakes and unplanned actions.

It is 7 and nothing more than that. Low fun factor.

RATING: 10
Another clever rondel game from Mac Gerdts. Perhaps even slicker than the "Imperials," this game moves quickly and provides enough decision points to keep your interest, despite being relatively simple and easy to pick up. There is very little downtime and, with three players, comes in under two hours. All the moving parts fit together seamlessly and the market mechanic seems to work well - it will be interesting to learn whether four or five players will change this significantly.

The VP track around the board will concern some players until they see that it only comes into play during the final scoring at game end. On the other hand, watching the actions of your opponents will give you a pretty good idea how everyone is doing. It turns out that the accumulation of victory points is quite transparent once you see how the final scoring works. For those worried about such things, it will come down to whether you prefer to play with open or closed money.

Rondel games have their charm but some have complained that the "Imperials" suffer from the mid to late-game "spin-cycle" which must simply be endured as by then the winner has pretty well become apparent. So far, a similar phenomena has not been seen here. I've quite enjoyed the games I've played so far and look forward to more plays, particularly with more players. My one concern is that the game will "play itself out" sooner than other more complex games.

Edit Note - One thing that should be mentioned here in its favour is that it is an extremely good game for three players, which the Imperials are not. One might even think this game was designed for three.

Further Note -I've had the chance now to play with four and five players and am happy to report that the playing time did not go up appreciatively and while quite a different game (more likely to have the end triggered by building depletion as player numbers increase), it was no less fun and interesting to play. I've decided that it scales very well to the number of players which is another plus in its favour.

And yet another note - As I return yet again to this title I no longer worry that it will wear out its welcome. It is a wonderful game for three, four or five players and is my favorite Rondel game of the lot...

I like it, but I have a few concerns.  Each strategy is an cog in a larger economic engine, and it seems like it's well balanced.  That means that the winner may be the person who finds their own niche, sticks to it, and doesn't get mucked by other people.  I won my first game, and my ships barely left the harbor.  I focused on production buildings, and nobody else did.  The person to my left wisely took plantations, but someone else adopted that strategy too, leaving me ahead.

These are my first impressions, and may change.  I'm intrigued to try again.

Mid to heavy euro with very little randomness.  Economic with a bit of market manipulation.  Several different viable strategies to pursue.

Cada jugador debe intentar obtener el máximo de puntos, a través de varios parámetros y haciendo valer un tablero de multiplicadores. Se puede puntuar por número de trabajadores, número de barcos, puntos de exploración, colonias, astilleros, catedrales y alguna cosa mas. La partida se desarrolla en tres fases que se van activando a medida que los barcos van avanzando por el mar. El final llega cuando tres barcos llegan a la ultima zona. Los costes de las cosas varían de una fase a otra. Interesante sistema de mercado para conseguir dinero. 
Las acciones se escogen mediante un rondel de acciones, tipo imperial. Me gusta mucho. Recomendable.

Navegador is the paradigm of solid eurogames: excellent components, few rules with no room for exceptions, short playtime, close scores and multiple paths to victory. One of its strengths is the little to no downtime between turns, a pattern shared by all rondel games. The rondel actions seem well balanced and work like clockwork. In this case, the key to winning seems to identify and then follow the path of least resistance, so you do not compete for the different bonus tiles.

My biggest quibble is the oversized box, which won't fit anywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow. 

This might be Mac Gerdt's best rondel game, besting Antike.

A pure efficiency/economics game. Lots of potential different paths. Timing seems critical in this game. You gotta know when to sell vs process, which buildings to buy. Going to the market to maximize your income based on what opponents are doing and NOT doing. Definitely not multi-player solitaire. If you do not carefully watch what your opponents are doing/not doing, then you will lose. 

This is truly one of the most balanced, multiple paths to victory game that I have ever experienced. Unlike in so many euros, getting the most actions or having the best money generating engine doesn't get you the win. 

And to top it all off, the game is highly thematic.

Fantastic!

Throw a few hamsters into a box, give them each a few pieces of wood, nails and hammer, allow them to each craft their own wheels. Come back 2 hours later and see which one has spun the fastest. Not inherently a bad game and better than Concordia, but still a dry Euro optimiser. It attempts to create a nautical navigation theme but in reality you could play this almost without a map and just columns and tiles. I appreciate the Rondel mechanic and Imperial is still a great game but this fails when compared. Most of the other negative comments are pretty spot on, one of the biggest issues in these rondel games is that the longer you work the rondel, the more entrenched your style on the wheel becomes and the less exciting the game is. The last few turns are just auto-pilot wheel spinning, no epic feel, build up or excitement.

Finally getting around to commenting on this game.   First, it's very pretty,and the rondel mechanism really works well here.  There is a sort of a race going on, but not all players need to participate in it to have a shot at winning.  It's definitely a game where you need to distance yourself from the crowd.   If someone is going after a strategy, you need to find your own thing,or you will be hampering each other all game long.

RATING: 7.5
This is my pick for "favorite Mac Gerdts rondel game."  Imperial is probably his best game, but for two it was a little too much work for the fun payoff, and with more it is longer than I'd like.  Basically, I admire Imperial more than I enjoy playing it.  I enjoy Princes of Macchu Picchu, but the gold victory is out of whack and makes the game more one-sided than I'd like.

Navegador, on the other hand, is a great combination between a simple yet deep rondel mechanic and a game of procedural geography similar to many Winsome games.  Basically, you try to maximize your VP by doing certain things - building colonies, factories, churches, etc.  What's great is that you can collect multiplies for these categories, and these are limited in availability.  The rules of the game are fairly straightforward and easy, as are the rondel actions - turns move fast.  There are two ways to make money (somewhat at odds with each other) but money is just the key to buying getting ahead in your specialized areas.  The pace of the game is set by the map - once you've opened up the full progression from Portugal to Japan, the game is over.  This, coupled with the rondel, makes for a game where timing is crucial.  The game plays very well with two, moreso than any of the other rondel games - I do use the [thread=671709]Tom Lehman variant[/thread] though.  A super solid Euro.

RATING: 8.5
Wonderful, tense, tight game. There are several paths to victory, but you have to do a little of everything to stay competitive. The heart of the game lies in figuring out the right balance between specializing in one area and doing well in everything else. What other players do has a direct impact on which path you choose, which makes this an incredibly exciting game. 

The rondel is simply awesome. Since each action is important, and timing can often be crucial, it can be very tricky deciding whether to jump forward on the rondel or linger behind. The rondel, however, also enables you to see what is available to other players, which makes each of your own decisions even harder: do you use the Navegador extra action now, even though it might benefit the other player on their next turn? Should you colonize a sugar plantation, even though someone else bought a bunch of sugar and are likely to drive down the price? From the very first turn the game takes on a very tense and thinky dimension that lasts throughout the entire game. A truly wonderful design.

RATING: 8.5
3/22/16: 3 plays. My second Mac Gerdts game (Concordia being the first) that I really enjoy.  The setup on the rondel makes for some really tough choices during the game which is good,  although during the end game what players tend to go for is somewhat predictable.  I have come to really like the scoring of points being done during the end game as it adds some suspense and surprise to the final outcome.  You don't necessarily feel you're out of it until the end.

5/14/16: Upped my rating to 8.5.   One of my top 20 games.

An exercise in optimizing use of the rondel actions, and balancing building your economy vs picking up the scoring privileges. I find Antike to be a more enjoyable take on the race for points using a rondel, and Concordia has more interesting economy vs scoring trade-offs.

Interesting rondel mechanic for action choice during your turn, which makes long-term strategic planning possible.  Initial impressions are that you need stay even with everyone else in terms of shipyards, churches, and workers. Need to convert money to units towards end of game ($200 = 1 VP, but ships and workers start at $50 each, so don't hoarde the $$).

Still making up my mind.  I like the game quite a bit, but not sure if I really love it yet.  First rondel game I've played.

After second play, I appreciated the game much more.  Still getting a handle on strategy with the rondel, but a very good game.

After third play.  First game with more than 2P.  I think it really enhanced the gameplay as there was more competition for the different strategies and more interesting market interactions.  Up to a 9.

RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable exploration and trading game, with a nice supply & demand mechanism and oodles of difficult tactical choices pretty much every turn courtesy of the Rondel.  While slightly abstract – no needless chrome here – it still manages to be fairly thematic; a plus for me.  The only thing holding me back from giving it a higher rating is my concern that there are not many options on your first turn and what there are seems to lend a significant advantage to the first to sail and explore.  More plays may confirm that is a problem or convince me otherwise but I certainly look forward to finding out.

A few games in and it continues to be competitive and fun. The rondel creates enough tension, and the choices for points are varied enough and all strategic. I got beat by Christine as she sailed through the seas quickly and focused on exploration to gain her big points. I went for buildings and slow growth.

Has this become my all time favorite game?  Not sure but I really love it.  Lost last night - beautiful implementation of the ship/exploration strategy that I have never been able to pull off.  This game continues to intrigue!

Still love this game.  It is my, "I never lose at this" game.  Lost last night to another exploration/shipyard strategy.  Three player game (when I usually play 4-5).  I had 15 colonies and 12 factories at the end.  Didn't quite max out the colony privileges (do some evil blocking by the third player).  Lost by 7 point in the mid-140's!  Great game! (7-12-17)

Great game! I really like the rondel mechanic, it's a unique element; well, I know there are many other games with a rondel, but it's not THAT common compared to other mechanics, and I hadn't tried any other games with a rondel before.

The mechanics are very well thought out and interlocked in a way I think only few games can match. Once you know the rules, it's actually a very easy gameplay; easy to learn, hard to master. This also means that it's one of those games you might be able to introduce to new players after you've played Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne and such (we have done so with success!), but experienced gamers will still enjoy it a lot.

Overall it's a game I enjoy and which has lots of paths to victory which is always a huge plus. It is true, though, that it's hard to win if you are using the same strategy as an other player, especially if it's the player to your right, while others have a strategy for themselves, but overall I still enjoy this game for it's simple yet deep mechanics. However, after repeated plays it seems that the paths to victory are sort of "fixed"; you either focus on, for instance, churches and factories, or you focus on shipyards and exploring and such.

I gave it a rating of 8.5 after two plays or so, but after having played the game 7 times I have decreased my rating slightly; it's still a very good game, it's just not one I want to play all the time.

Navegador is easily one of the more exciting games I've played that I wasn't actively hunting down to own myself. I really enjoy Imperial 2030, so I was keen to see how that rondel worked in another game. It certainly does with this one.

Both Imperial 2030 and Navegador share something I love, which is the benefits of the rondel. The rondel provides simplicity in turn order (i.e. choose your rondel space--execute the action--next!), but the angst in wanting to do everything but move onto the next juicy action. Where they diverge is that Imperial 2030 is a stock game, and Navegador is really a tech-tree game of sorts.

Navegador's map is beautiful. And, I love how the game gradually progresses across the board. There seems to be multiple paths to victory. I was just simply impressed by this game and very much look forward to playing it again.

I imagine if I played this years ago before Concordia I would have bought it instantly as it really is quiet clever. Move 1-3 spaces on the rondel and do the action of the space you land on. Each space does something different and all the actions intertwine together well so I can see how you can execute a slightly different strategy each game if you want although it does feel a bit more limited. Between the linear map, goods in same location, scoring multipliers, and rondel actions it all feels so similar to Concordia which has all the variability built into it. Lastly, I have found in a second play that the person who has gone after a scoring objective with minimal interaction from others has won the game both times, this forces a diverse strategy which is not apparent to everyone on the first play. I would definitely be willing to play this game again as it is a solid euro game, but for my collection I will gladly keep Concordia.

I think this is the most subtly elegant of the rondel games to date. I didn't appreciate the beauty of it immediately, but there are some nice elements.  Most notable is the distribution of actions on the rondel itself. 

In some of the prior games, there were some channels carved out that you'd perform repetitive cycles. It was not too hard to predict what players were going to do based on rondel position. In this game, every single action you skip is slightly painful. But there are enough varied strategies and flexibility that you can alter your choice based on what players around you are doing. I don't want to overstate that point, but I do think the rondel itself is a lot more delicately balanced than in past games.

The theme seems to work for me. The progression through exploration is visually intuitive. 

I had lukewarm expectations of this one, but it surprised me.

My favorite rondel game! What to invest in is a delightfully tough choice, timing is critical, and you get to build meaningful endgame scoring criteria(a Gertz trademark, but at it's best here.) Everything is positive except for the theme, and because of that if it came out today, I wouldn't purchase it. I don't want to be the best explorer establishing markets/colonies/???, I just don't want to pretend to do those things. Navegador got grandfathered in though.

Update after a dozen+ plays:
This is a vp game that rewards specialization. That's good. Unfortunately, it's also an economic engine game, and you are completely hosed if you try to develop the same or similar engine to the player to your right. You don't need to comit to the vp specialization until after your economy is rolling. And if your economy doesn't get rolling, you're toast, with no possible path of recovery. This isn't nearly as multi-dimensional as it first appeared. Rating bumped down a bit.
-----
Very clean system. Extremely low randomness. I don't say that purely as a good thing, but it is what it is. Those who like planning things out should be comfortable here. The main unknown is the chaos of other player's. Nice supply/demand market system. There's a strong motivation to base what you're producing/selling to be opposite of the player before you. As there are three types of goods, it is best as a 4p for optimal tension. With 3p each player can produce and sell non-conflicting goods as other players.

If it works, don't fix it. That should be Mac Gerdts' motto, if it isn't his motto already. The fact that he is shamelessly reusing the same mechanism time and time again, with very little variation in between games, is beginning to look suspiciously like laziness at his design end. Navegador is a 'simple' rondel game (like Hamburgum and Princes of Macchu Pichu) in that actions on the rondel have short and well-defined consequences; this in sharp contrast to Antike where 'movement' can be a long game-changing ordeal. And compared to the other short rondel games, Navegador actually looks ergnomically acceptable too. The game itself is a familiar mix of things influencing each other so that you really want to do everything on the rondel. And just like any other rondel game, there is the sensation of walking on a stair with uneven steps. Especially Navegador is about chosing a method of playing and then sticking to it more religiously than a fundamentalist to his scripture. Small errors can cost you the game here. 

That all said, Navegador isn't all simplicity. The market mechanism makes a left-right binding very important; you can really wreak havoc with a player's immediate future prospects by doing exactly what he does as long as you are on his right. As a result you should always try to do something everyone else isn't (or is so far away that the play order effects are washed out somewhat) and then Navegador begins to feel constrained rather quickly. When the game is up and running it is, apart from the blasted rondel, a fine game to play... But there simply can't be much variation between games because of the need of everyone doing something else, and the rondel not presenting that much variety. I  probably will play Navegador in the future again on occasion, but I also think that these plays will be all that I need to satisfy my curiosity. If I ignore the rondel the game is worth a 6 to me; but since I can't, it means that Navegador gets one point deduction.

Components: Lovely old-style board; lots of wooden bits; chunky money. Given how central the rondel is, it should perhaps be a bit larger.

Experience: Wow, there is a lot going on in this game. I made the early mistake of thinking this is a game like Agricola, where I need to keep up in each aspect, whereas the game moreso favors those who specialize in a few types of scoring. This speaks well for some near-term replayability, that there are different strategic paths to test.

It's difficult to predict which actions other players will take, and therefore how the state of the board will change before my next turn; I find myself just planning out my own next moves, and hoping that the board favors those decisions when it's my turn.

Navegador is a solid game.  The rules are straight forward, and there are a lot of choices  You can use hard earned resources (ships) to get an edge in future turns.  There are also limited amounts of Privileges to fight over for victory point multipliers.  

It takes a complete play to see how it all fits together, and how to make all your efforts stack together for the most efficient point engine.  You could certainly play many times without ever using the same strategy.

With all that said, I though the game was a little flat.  I liked being able to do a lot of different things, but it just wasn't all that exciting.  I think a hidden scoring element would help a lot.  I don't like it went you can glance at the table at getting a pretty good idea who is in the lead.

It's worth a try to decide for yourself.  It is a solid game, but not a keeper for me.

Players choose actions on a rondel in order to build shipyards in order to build ships to explore the Oceans as Portuguese seafarers, build colonies, produce commodities in these colonies and sell these to the market, build factories to produce finished products and sell these to the market, and...build churches, which used to be necessary to attract a work force. Points are scored per colony, factory, explored sea, shipyard and church. These numbers are multiplied by a certain amount of points which can be influenced by obtaining privileges (extra points) by killing a worker. Yes, these were strange and cruel times. Each worker and ship on the board at the end of the game also equals 1 point, as does each full 200 Cruzados (the monetary unit). Prices of commodities (sugar, gold, spices) go down when a new load arrives and is sold on the market. Concurrently, the price of the finished good which is based on this commodity rises. When finished goods are sold, their price falls, while the price of the corresponding commodity increases. Prices are in other words purely supply driven. There is no link with demand for the commodities by the factories. It is not even necessary to have a colony producing spices in order to sell dried spices in jars from your factories. So, the market mechanism is a bit peculiar, but it does allow for fast price changes.
Overall, the game plays very fluently. Downtime while waiting for other players to take a decision is minimal, because the logical choices on the rondel are fairly clear, since you can only take 3 steps max...unless you start burning your ships...

This game is inspired by the Portuguese Age of Discoveries in the 15th-16th century. Players take actions such as contracting men, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges. Each player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.
There are several undiscovered lands that allow players, once discovered, to found some colonies there.
At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.

The rondel is a cool mechanic of the game and really its major asset.

The theme (charting the unknown seas) is also nice and quite appealling for portuguese players.
The game develops in a logical way, gathering resources and making use of the market price flutuations, however, some privileges seem quite unbalanced (churches, for instance) and the discover actions seem to be too much penalized, since you have to throw away an entire boat and submit to whatever the new land brings to you.
It is also usual that the most advanced player on the map is not the one who has more points, so he delays the game end (not reaching Japan), hoping to catch up, but that proves quite hard to achieve, so the game continues for more 15/30 min with no change whatsoever in the lead.
Wrapping up, it´s a game that generates some interest around the theme and some of its mechanics but, on the other hand, suffers from some rough edges in its rules.

Just like Concordia, I need to give this game another shot. The game feels like it starts without a lot of direction. The goal is get the most points and the end game is triggered by reaching the end of the map but nothing really pushes you towards ending the game. I want to say that the player teaching us got the rules on the market wrong because it felt way too plentiful for 4 players. So far a solid game but nothing that I was blown away by.

Good game, not as complex as Imperial, but requires a bit of forethought and some variance in strategy. Screwy with odd numbers of players (usually 5) due to the market push-pull, someone is usually shafted.

In this surprisingly fast-paced game, actions are chosen via a rondel mechanic. You can explore, produce goods, colonize, sell, build ships and increase your workforce. Each of these things works differently with the others, making for many viable victory strategies.

However, depending on what other players do, you're better off being flexible. Instead of doing the same thing as them, try to use what they're doing to your benefit. (So, if the player right before you is focussing on exploring, you can tag along behind and colonize all his newly-explored regions. There are many such strategies in this great game.)

Initial impressions are positive. There's a lot going on here, considering how simple the rules are. There are several ways to score points, and you do want to specialize, but you have some breathing room -- you don't have to set a laser focus early on and just hope that it works out.

Yet another Rondel.
This has a multitude of ways to score points, but specialisation is important given multipliers can be purchased.
The board looks great, especially since its essentially just a linear track with a few tables tacked on. (Yes the first few spaces have cross conenctions, but then its just a race track.)
I was disappointed with the mechanism for advancing further on the rondel (ship discard) since these is an exorbitant price. I can see it rarely being useful which makes it a waste of rule space and removes some tactical flexibility.
I do also feel - given the multiplier and collection of tiles/chits - that lucking out on a specialisation that none of your opponents is pursuing is more important than executing a well crafted strategy. Yes, you can keep your options open to then take what no one else is going for, but if you happen to fall into something alone on day 1, you're probably going to win.

RATING: 8
Ninety percent of the scoring in this game is akin to the 'sand bottom' scoring in Stone Age. You choose from five different items to collect and try to accumulate the multipliers that coordinate best with your collection. I liked that idea in Stone Age, and I like it here.
The only randomness in the game is the order in which the colonies are revealed, in much the same way as the plantations provide a minimal random element in Puerto Rico. I wonder whether playing against Navegador's adepts eventually will prove as discouraging as playing against Puerto Rico experts.

This is a very enjoyable 90 minutes game.  There is a lot of think about, but your options are always constrained to 1 of 3 possible actions, which makes the game move at a good pace.  This might be my favorite of the rondel games, which is saying a lot since I was already a big fan of Imperial.

It has a similar feel to Puerto Rico in that you are constantly watching to see what the person to your left is doing (you don't want to do the same thing as them), but it has a simpler learning curve since there are not a whole bunch of buildings that you can buy.

I have only played it once, so I cannot say for certain how much re-playability the game has, but it seems to have significant depth and many viable strategies.

Played two 5-player games today. Great game!

The first game was not well played as we were experimenting with ideas, but in the first round of the second game it was almost "Puerto Rico-like" in the deliberations about how to react to what each player did. That is a VERY good sign.

The Navegador card is a brilliant balancing mechanism (for seating order) and game mechanic.

Simple mechanics, tough decisions, multiple paths to victory - an easy 8 after our first session. I can see the rating going up.

RATING: 9
I played my first two games yesterday and today. Second game was better than the first. The market action takes some effort to figure, but I think we have come up with a way to keep that fiddyness to a minimum. Both games were very tight in score. First game was a tie for the win at 60 something and the third player being only 2 points less. The tie breaker being the holder of the Navegador (or the next tied player to get it if the holder isn't the winner) was kinda hollow for the amount of time put into the game. The second game we scored over double the points of the first, with first and last place only being 6 points difference. A very, very balanced and tight game. It makes me wonder what a person needs to do to "pull away from the pack". The first game took 2.5 hours and the second took 3 hours to finish. The box sites 45-90 minutes which I believe is way off, even as we get more comfortable with the mechanics.

I like rondella games but on this particular game I think another mechanism would have been better. Somehow it felt like there was not enough interesting choices to be made. Sure, several paths to victory and all that, but beneath the cool theme it's just another build your VP engine type game.

RATING: 7
I'll start this at an 8.  I don't typically like Rondel systems that much.  Often I feel like the paths become very static...1st half of the game take spots A, C, and E...2nd half take B, D, and F.  While this game has some of this, it is not a pronounced pattern.  Sometimes you really want to go to every spot and it comes down to which spots *must* you have to get the VPs necessary to win.  It also has a pretty cool economic mechanic whereby you use factories to raise the price of goods and you sell goods to drop the price.

But the downside of this cool mechanic is the that I'm not sure it makes sense thematically.  Thus I had trouble figuring out exactly how it worked together.  A couple trips to the market will make it all clear though.

On the negative side, the market does swing up and down a lot...so it's hard to predict a pattern, use strategy and cash in.  Mostly you are at the whim of players going before you.  Still, it's not a huge difference maker either way.

Collecting factories seems very strong...that combined with 5 multiplier in the privilege category produced a lot of VPs...all while still maintaining economic momentum.  Hopefully it isn't too strong a strategy.

Figure the final rating will be between 8 (where I put i now) and 6.

Update: As expected, this one has dropped a bit.  Moving it down to a 7.  I think it has a low ceiling with not too much replayability.

Navegador, the latest in a long line of rondel games by Mac Gerdts, is a game focused on the exploration of and exploitation of the resources of South America, Africa, and Asia. It has many parallels to Hamburgum, but is described as many as an improvement and upgrade on that less well-regarded game. I have not played Hamburgum, so I can’t comment on that comparison.

There are two major axis of action in this game, one built around factories, buildings and population, the other one built around shipbuilding, sailing, and colonization. In all likelihood, players will dabble in both areas during the game, but some specialization is lucky, and I suspect true specialization is also possible. Both axis’s take advantage of a two dimensional market across three potential resource types, where colonies or factories are use to generate income, with each one driving down the income possible for their dimension, while increasing the income for the other.

The sailing-shipbuilding-population axis seems to be more action intensive, but has the advantage of giving bonus points, in the forum of explorers, and cash from exploring new territories. The factories-building-population axis tends to be a bit more cash tight but is more action efficient.

Victory points are gained from acquiring prestige markers, which cost population, and increase the player’s personal multiplier for having specific buildings, colonies, or explorers at the end of the game.

Navegador is another game I am currently uncertain about. I generally respect Mac Gerdt’s designs, with an especial appreciation for Imperial/2030 and the Princes of Macchu Pichu, but my one play of this game did not wow me. I expect to get more plays of this in the near future, however, so hopefully it will end up being one that grows on me over time.

RATING: 8
Players are Portuguese explorers and businessmen, trying to earn cash and victory points through exploration and exploitation of resources.  Nicely implemented rondel game, using the base mechanic of advancing your pawn around the action track, and taking the action.  Actions include recruiting ships and workers (costing money, but you need them), building buildings (shipyards, churches and goods factories), founding colonies (which provide goods), moving ships (to reach the colonies), purchasing privilege (end game victory point multipliers), and working the market (selling goods, dropping the price, or processing goods, raising the price).  Tightly designed, moments of genuine indecision abound, as everything is worth considering and attractive.  If it has a fault, the game perhaps grinds to a conclusion, forced by one player who has to assume they're winning and take a risk.  Other than that, wonderful - this and Shipyard are the only rondel games you need.

RATING: 8
A weirdly elusive game. I wasn't entirely sure why I lost or won on my several plays - I knew I was outplayed, but why? Bit like life really. I enjoyed my plays of this game, for a euro it's quite thematic and turns are instant (or can be), and with this speed you feel like you've played a weightier longer game in about an hour, which is how fast you can play this game with two. Plays well to very well with two. I like the simplified market, which gives this game a strong economic vibe, tied to an exploration element and a racing aspect. It's not really that reminiscent of anything except games by the same designer, which bodes well. 

There wasn't much I disliked: I wasn't so bothered by the Royal Favour (or whatever) bit, felt fiddly overall and the games certainly thinky over being fun, without much direct influence over other players. Though it isn't solitary as the other players influence is there, though it isn't direct.

Overall I found there was something elusive about this game, like it was trying to show me something just out of reach. It stuck in my mind after playing which is always a good sign, but I'd rather play Concordia. They are not that reminiscent of each other, but there are similarities (the cards in concordia are a sort of rondel) and concordia is more simple, streamlined, plays faster, has a great expansion and is much easier to get to the table. Concordia has worse box art. I quite like the guy on this box, that's how you feel when playing. Your mind is busy, too busy to be having fun? I don't know. Which route do you wish to take, it matters a great deal, but you might not ever realise why.

This was my first exposure to the rondel.  I liked the rondel mechanism itself, but the rest of the game didn't do much for me, even though on the face of it this game does some things that usually appeal to me, such as market economies.  However, this game has a lot of "bad Euro" characteristics, the most severe of which in my opinion is that there is a lotta math here, and it's bad math because you actually have to work it out turn to turn.  You (or and least I) can't just make an intuitive play and be confident the scoring will reward that choice. 

I also, in principle, like the idea of multiple scoring paths, so that players can do entirely different things and be competitive.  However, here this is done in an unexciting way.  This isn't the first recent Euro in which I felt that everything was oh so carefully balanced that it didn't really matter what I did, as long as I did it efficiently and kept up with the math to make sure to squeeze out every last point.  Yeech.  

Overall, this game was a tedious experience for me and I have little desire to replay it.  The board is gorgeous though.

There might not be anything new here:  supply and demand spice markets, shipping, colonizing, getting workers, building factories, etc.  But despite that, it works together pretty well.  I haven't played a lot of the other rondel games, but it seems to fit nicely here.   My only complaint was that it felt a little long for what it is, but I'm sure it can be played faster with experience.  I liked the scoring grid where you can decide how you want to weight your scoring in different categories.

RATING: 6
Engine-building efficiency race with tactical puzzles created by the rondel, contended resources, the extra navegador turn, and an ever-changing market. Point multipliers are clearly visible, which I like much better than the hidden-but-trackable multipliers in Concordia. There are several races to grab resources, along with a market that rewards guessing what other players will do, creating some Euro-style interaction.

In our first play, the game seemed to stall a bit as players turned the cranks on their engines several times before sailing forward. The game was far too long, but should speed up with future play.

Some comment, didn't cover all elements.
In Navegador, the ONLY luck you can find is where you randomly place the colony tokens on their respective spot across the continent. What you're basically doing is just randomizing the value of the tokens, that's it.

As for the economic, this concentrates on the market. It's also your basic mean of income throughout the game. In the market, players will sell goods (with tokens/plantations) and process goods (with factory). Best thing about this part is, the market prices for each goods (sugar, spices, gold) constantly fluctuate so there can be a little drama there as money is a little scarce in the game as you need it to recruit new workers, build ships, buy colony tokens, and build buildings (there are many of them; church, shipyard and 3 different factories).

Navegador is not a worker placement game, but there's one action where you can recruit new workers. You're just keeping track of the amount of workers that you have (2 to 9), and that's it. You don't actually take your worker and place theme somewhere on the board to take the action, no. In this game, workers are used for you to buy colony tokens, take privilege token, and as a requirement for you to buy/construct buildings.

Is this game intense? Well I'd say yeah. You can't track of someone's VPs while playing, so there's some sense of uncertainty there. You're constantly on the watch as to what people are doing, Individual turn takes one min or two and and there are 7 different actions that a player can do. So it's fast (your next turn takes less than 10 mins?) and games constantly on the move and the pace keep changing.

Comment Update: I absolutely love Navegador with more players, and 5 being my best experience (4 was ok while 3 was not so enjoyable for me). The fact that a player's action only takes mere seconds (that's quick!); thanks to rondel) or 1-2 mins max (I think), make you glued to your seat as the downtime is low. Our 5 players game is always about 105-120 mins max.

There's definitely more tension especially at the market as the price plunge up/down unpredictably (sometimes). Since this game has 5 main ways for you to score VPs (colony tokens, factory, church, shipyard, exploration disc), and with 5 players, you can see how tight the decisions will be.

This is one of my favourite economic game with a nice touch of exploration and management. I absolutely love teaching this game.

I like this game, a lot.  It's beautifully produced, thematic, and very strategic.  I think, though, for my tastes, Navegador might be just a little too restrictive.  Like it lacks enough interesting decisions and tension, or something along those lines.

Within a very short period of time, most of the strategies at the table seem to be set, and then it feels like a relatively linear trajectory to the finish.  There certainly are plenty of tactical considerations to be made but they seem smaller, and maybe a bit less impactful than I'd like.

That said, I must still insist that the overall experience of playing is extremely pleasant, enjoyable and something I look forward to.  I can only see the rating moving up as, hopefully, some of the more nuanced elements of the game become more apparent with familiarity.

Turns are quick and it plays well with 5P when you want to play an action efficiency game without direct conflict. You're required to manage your infrastructure of buildings and ships while sending your ships out to colonize and grab goods that will make you money via the market action. Specialization is required here (which is against my generalist nature), so I scuffle at the game though I still enjoy it. 

The end is a bit wonky, or so it seems after only a couple plays, as one player will have to take the chance to end the game without full knowledge that they'll win.

This is quite an engaging game, and my favorite of the Mac Gerdts rondel games I have played.  I'll be happy to play it again.  We played with the designer-approved variant of putting the king's favor tokens in Goa.

Navegador is obviously a more mature rondel game, and compared to it's predecessors has more complicated decisions required at most of the rondel stops.  It therefore seems a little more AP prone than the others.  Clearly, there are multiple paths to success and seemingly no one obviously dominant strategy.

For me, Navegador is perhaps the best of the non-Imperial rondel games and one that I need to play more.

After one play: Feels clunky compared to the other rondel games. And while there are lots of things you might do, any particular path is not clear. It's like Caylus in that regard for me: Lots of options but no real grace connecting them all. Throw a bunch of s*** up and see what sticks.

B&B/purchased 2010/arrived 

This is another of the Rondel Series (Antike, Hamburgum, Imperial).  They are all good, and this one is very different.  I like it better than Imperial & Imperial 2030, and in fact, this might be my favorite. I am impressed with how different each game is (well, except of course, for the two Imperial games).

Many avenues to winning.  I like being able to plan my moves in advance because then the games doesn't lag.  It can move very quickly at the end.

Attractive board & bits.  

I hope this game makes it to the table often.

[2 plays]  Some very nice dynamics in the market vs. something like Hamburgum here.  You really have to specialize, though, and I'm left wondering how much this game is won as opposed to given to you by the other players.  There's this critical part in the beginning where you decide where you think the least competition is going to be and from then on I think you just cross your fingers and hope it turns out you were right.  If this continues, it will probably drop another point into line with the rest of the rondel games minus Imperial.

A solid enough game with multiple paths to victory that somehow still ends up feeling somewhat constrained. It feels a bit scripted especially since the way the board is explored and geography comes into play works out the same in every game. It's a game that rewards picking a long-term strategy and sticking with it, while knowing the right time to carry out specific pieces of the plan. I enjoy it, but not as much as I was hoping to.

Nagyon tetszett elsőre. aránylag egyszerű szabályok, ám mégis van min agyalni benne. A rondellás megoldás ügyesen korlátozza a lehetséges akciók számát, és nem lesz túlzott ap-s, mert azért 3-4 akcióból mindenki tud aránylag hamar választani.
2 személlyel is jól működik, szép, hangulatos.
Annak ellenére, hogy eléggé euro, én bele tudtam élni magam a hajókázásba. Mindenképp ki kell próbálni több fővel is, nomeg kettesben is játszani még párat.

Navegador is a solid if fairly standard resource optimization game with the rondel being the defining feature.

Most of the victory points come from privileges that act as multipliers for various achievements (e.g. number of colonies established, shipyards built, or regions explored). There are several divergent paths to those achievements, and the major difficulty is aligning those goals with the rondel mechanic. As in most optimization games you never have enough actions to begin with, and you must be careful not to waste some of those precious actions because you're sitting on the wrong side of the rondel. Therefore, looking ahead two to three turns is a good idea especially because many of the actions also need to be paid for, and getting to the desperately needed action space without being able to pay for it is, surprisingly, not going to help much.

Rondel mechanism was interesting and I thought the market was a little simple, but everything else was pretty straightforward Euro with all scoring at the end.  Difficult to see how you were doing, end-game scoring led to surprises.  I'm sure more familiarity would reduce the surprises.

I really enjoyed this one and would play again any time.  The rondel is neat and fun, and the balance of racing ahead to take certain actions or trying to take your time and gain some efficiencies is an enjoyable challenge.  Definitely a heavier game.

I think Navegador is a fine game. I like how it uses Gerdts' 'Rondel' mechanic in a very easy going way, but with multiple points of tough decision making. On the other hand, there are times where the _best_ move is just glaring, and this may happen one too many times to have this game escape from a rather 'scripted' feel at points. I like the other mechanics- they are very clean, and turns come by quickly. It also feels like a tight, well-balanced game. So, not my favourite in terms of depth, but this is my favourite Gerdts game at this point.

Such an enjoyable game! Every person I have introduced this game to has loved it and procured a copy. I have found different strategies and have won with each (or seen people win with them). The only complaint I have is that once you take a path you are committed (if you want to do well that is). The game is very static in that regard. My high rating comes from the enjoyment we all get when playing it.

A superb economic/trading game that I really like. This time you're a Portuguese merchant in the age of discoveries, sending huge fleets around the globe in search of prestige and profits. Great rondel mechanic, many different ways to score points, historical accuracy (it even comes with a booklet that explains important personages in the game) and a very pretty map combine to make a modern classic IMHO.

Only played twice (5 players), but already I know: this is the economic game for me! 
Worthwhile economic decisions, without a lot of book keeping. 
Great, quick game flow. 
And the way a "race" from A to B, with so few steps and with such simple means, can be so so dynamic, is just masterfully done. 
OK, I have only played Navegador twice, but still: Simple, quick and deep. Impressive!

After three plays -- all wins -- I feel like once one has circled the rondel once or twice, the wheels have been set in motion and players are really just going along for the ride till the end. Perhaps with a table of experienced players, those first few laps round the rondel are tense games of timing. Even still, that leaves the bulk of the game time to just following one's chosen path to victory, because by that point, there's no real changing one's tack.

In my last game, I acted as banker and market adjuster. So I rarely had the opportunity to notice what the other three players were doing on their turns. And yet, in the end, it didn't seem to matter.

RATING: 6
Probably my preferred Rondel game, but suffers from slavish adherence to multiple-paths-to-victory orthodoxy when the one true strategy really boils down to doing whatever other players aren't doing.

Still enjoyable for what it is, within that genre.

Probably needs the optional rule requiring access to Goa for a King's Privilege to stop strategies that focus entirely on buildings from running away with it.

The decision process is bland (rondel is a dumbed down version of mancala), the repetitiveness of it boring.

After one 5-player game. Really good euro with rondel and market mechanics. Rondel fits here perfectly - you have though decisions which actions to take and when. Market mechanism also works great, because you not only earn money, but also can help the other players to earn it. The whole game seems a perfectly designed and testet mechanism. And the artwork is good. And the most important - I have much fun playing it. Good job Mr. Gerdts!

I've only played once, but this may well be the best of the rondel games. There are NO "dead" spaces on the rondel in this one, all the way up to the end game moves. The mechanics match the theme very well (losing ships due to exploration, ships getting faster as the technology develops and navigation and sailing methods improve), and the market is brilliant. The fact that there seem to be multiple paths to victory is also a huge plus. This one seems like a real keeper!

RATING: 7
Another rondel game from Mac Gerdts. This time you are sailing the seas, establishing colonies and sell goods. Points are awarded in different things you build or develop.

Generally I think Mac Gerdts’ games are dry optimization games. This is no exception to that, but I like this more than the previous ones and feels a pinch more thematic than Antike and Hamburgum. I have generally hard time for market manipulation in games, but for me this works fine, maybe because it doesn’t feel like you are driving the others to sink. The game features different ways to score points which all seem balanced, but not all the same. It is probably not a game I will pick up, but I will gladly play it if it is suggested.

Two plays with five, though eight months apart. It's a hair on the dry side, but aside from that I liked it a lot. In particular I liked the fact that it's fairly meaty and yet it can still play in a relatively quick time frame. I think I'd need more plays to really be able to evaluate it, though, because there's definitely a learning curve to this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't agree that it is the best of the rondel games, but it is a solid one. During the game one will specialize in either buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches or colonies, to get most victory points at the end of the game (by getting also the according privilegues). These decisions or development is done during the first half of the game. Once this is clearly decided all players will fullfil their strategy as fast as they can. So the second half of the game is rather boring because you repeat always the same steps, only low interaction with other players as most of the colonies are now revealed. It's just not enough that only half of the game is interesesting.
edit: another play showed the same: 1st half interesting, third quarter repetitive, minor tactical decisions, last quarter boring and waiting for the end with minor optimization of victory points. Im sad but have to downrate the game. This rondel game is for beginners not advanced players.

RATING: 8
Played twice. Starting off at "8" though I expect it to rise. This is another winner from Mac Gerdts, I think the Rondel mechanic is great, I like the way it guides your choices keeping the game going at a good pace. Neat link with theme with clear whole game strategic paths to follow. Do you charge off in your ships on a voyage of discovery, do you take it slower establishing mines in the newly discovered lands (price of goods drops as you flood the market), do you build factories to process materials (uses up raw materials scarcity raises their price) or do you build churches which boosts your population of workers. Fascinating options, to follow more than 2 paths will dilute your endeavour and cause you to lose ground to your opponents. This is my joint favourite Essen 2010 game along with 20th Century. Oct 10

I have waited until I have played this a few times before giving a rating, so the 9 is not just an initial reaction. First game was a bit confusing but still rewarding, you could see how the various options on the rondel inter-related. Subsequent outings cemented the early feeling and I think the game works really well, and the theme is an integral part as you do think you are exploring and colonising and using the market wisely to fund these operations. 

One thing that impressed me was there is very little downtime between goes so it moved quickly. Very difficult to determine who is leading so near the end it's a dilemma whether to grab that last navigation counter or building or to have 'just one more' turn on the rondel and let someone else end the game!

Great stuff, a very satisfying 90 minutes.

Fantastic game, quick pace and a fair amount of excitement. The economics of the game are at the core, allowing you to raise the price of goods by producing them with your factories or lowering the price by selling goods for cash. On top of this is an exploration game where you race to explore new sea regions from Portugal to Japan (gaining you colonies that are markets for your sales). Finally, you curry royal favors to maximize the points you get at the end of the game. Game uses a rondel, is NOT a worker placement game, and is thoroughly fun. Highly recommended.

1st play - 2 player Solo.
I really enjoyed the flow of this game.  This isn't too brain burny even though there's a lot going on and a lot to balance as you play.  The Rondel mechanic actually makes it easier for players to break down their strategies and make their turns go faster than if a player could choose any action on their turn.  I can't wait to try this with more players (and not just by myself...)

I'm tempted to rate this game an early 10, but the only hesitation is that I think it may lack re-playability.  the randomizing factors in the game just aren't that random, mind you, I adore Caylus and could play it incessantly...

Simple game, but has little replayability. The game seems to be the same over and over again.

Also, there are a few mistakes, one big in the rulebook and one (well many) on the players' mat. That last one... why do we need to multiply the number of coins by the amount of priviledges we have to know what amount of cash we get? Why not just write that amount already? It would save time and prevent confusion or forgetfulness.

Would play, won't buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really liked the market place, which is quite clever. Whenever you sell raw material their price drops, but the price you earn for processing raw material increases.
Also, I like how the priviledges give you both money when you get it and victorypoints in the end. 

Also the rondel works quite nicely. However, spending a ship to go just one step further on the rondel is much too expensive. It almost never makes sense, because ships are very expensive, need an addtional turn to reproduce and you even only get one extra advance.

Still a very enjoyable game.

Satisfying. Rondel breaks the game down into very simple actions that interlock in clear and intelligible ways so the game moves along at a fair speed. The spacing of the actions seems designed to create difficult and engaging decision, having to skip an opportunity for one thing to prioritise another. The privilege system keeps everything relatively balanced. Building an income machine is important early game, and judging when it is sufficient and switching to point gathering is interesting. Only criticism is that game end seems to drag a little, it is just difficult to explore that final sea area. Unsure on replayability.

Fun game with a nice flow. Very dependent on figuring out what the people before you / after you are doing to establish your engines efficiently though. Sugar often turns out to be a bust because so many people rush for gold, and while in many games that would mean going for it would pay off, if nobody goes for the mills the person who grabs it can end up in a pretty bad place.

Another implementation of the rondel, that once again adds a layer of interactivity and phase-timing jokeying, while making turns very short.
More specifically, Navegador mixes a race for discoveries with engine building and market manipulation...  while it does sound complicated, it is not thanks to the rondel.
Thematically, it works on the same level as, say, Vasco da Gama; the theme is more than a veneer but is not that present neither.
Nevertheless, Navegador is a top tier game for its great depth/complexity ration and its amazingly short playing time. Too bad the theme is not more present enough.

It's boring, when you know in the third round, that because of a mistake you won't be able to win it. The mistake was to buy a privilege, which was not rewarded at the end, because the high income players are able to buy the privileges in the last rounds. So why buy it at the beginning?

RATING: 7.5
Navegador is easily the best of Gerdt's rondel games I have played (I have avoided Imperial and Inca Empire somehow so far), and it makes the rondel serve the theme of exploration and trade much better than Antike, and also better than Hamburgum.
Like the other rondel games, the use of the wheel becomes a matter of timing opportunity and aligning that with player strategy, in colony acquisition, factory, shipyard and church building, and in exploration.
For those who like dice, or a little randomness (why are you looking at this designer anyway?) you will not find it here, but likely instead the 'dry, mathematical Euro'. It's not that prototypical Euro exactly, but it's certainly more a model for thoughtful resource acquisition and expenditure than for warfare (even with the natives who were historically colonized.)
There is generally always a decent choice of actions, if not the one you really wanted to take again, and there are definite opprotunities to watch for, but also a variety of methods for collected endgame points.
I found the Market opportunities interesting, the resources as frustrating as usual (Arrgh! I need one more worker to make that Church, but will have to settlte for soemthing else now...), and the overall play moved quickly and logically to a conclusion.
The theme is better tied to the board and the strategy of play than in the other Gerdts' games that I know, and
this made the whole more inviting and interesting, and less of a mathematical exercise in ponderous conquest.
I am starting this at a 7.5 after a 1st solo 3-player game, and will be interested to see how much it comes out. I think this is a good, possibly great game, and I look forward to getting it on the table again soon.

The Market is fantastic. This is how good hamburgum could have been if it was done well.

I slightly felt the map could have been more interesting or it could have been double sided to show the exploration of the Americas (Antike is double sided with different maps in different languages, so why not?)

I still can't quite work out the optimal strategies, I know where I went wrong, but don't yet know how to put it right.

Another Mac Gerdts design, that takes the rondel mechanic and applies it to a "Age of Renaissance" setting, where players send ships west to the Americas first, and then work their way eastward towards the Far East ending in Japan. It is always interesting to see how Gerdts can take the rondel mechanic and revamp it to make a wholly new game with a different theme, and the different feel. While I got crushed in my first game, I can appreciate the design, and look forward to playing it again. However, it may take several more plays to convince me to get it for myself. It's a '7' for now.

Update (05/17/12): It's taken a year to play this again, but learning it anew was a frustrating experience. The typical Euro rules format is wordy, with the font several points too small. The game should be easy to explain, but it's not. The relationships between the actions and turning them into victory points is opaque and convoluted, more so than the linear sequence of Antike and Princes of Machu Picchu. Once this is figured out, the game flows smoothly and quickly. I think this will take a number of plays to play well, much like PoMP. Still a '7'.

OK, so it's just another rondel game, so it won't score above a 7 for me. This one is very much about getting to the cheap resources first, there's a variety of strategies to pursue, but each will score roughly the same, so winning is just a case of scrounging a few points more. I just wish Mac Gerdts would think of something else. Just once. Anything.

I was very impressed with Navegador.  It's a Mac Gerdts rondel applied to an exploration game with some economic elements and it works beautifully. Players can focus on any of several different elements, and there are different costs to each, and it's very important to keep your eye on who else might go for what you want.  A lot you can do, and a definite rise and fall in the action.  By far the best of the rondel games I've played.

Great non-confrontational game here! There is enough player interaction through the market and grabbing stuff before others can grab it. I love the rondel because it makes choosing what to do next so much easier.

The only downside is the little bit of arithmetics involved in optimizing one's profit when using the market action.

The game flows very nicely and feels just short/long enough. It packs a lot of gameplay in its 90 minutes of play time. I think I might even be able to teach this to my non-gamer family :)

RATING: 8.5
Fun game about the age of exploration.  All of the players are Portuguese explorers who are trying to collect the most victory points by: exploring unexplored regions, establishing colonies, building factories, shipyards, and churches.  The game board is quite large and illustrated with a nice looking, antique style map of the world.  The art of the map helps the theme come through.  The board also has a circular action selection area called a rondel, which the designer, Mac Gerdtz is famous for.  The rondel serves to make players' turns brief and reduce downtime between turns.  I love the rondel in this game and I also love it in his other game that I have played (Antike) as well.  There is a great market mechanism for the sale and consumption of the three resources in the game: sugar, gold, and spices.  This game has very little player interaction.  I like the mechanism for building, where each church or shipyard or factory costs more than the previously built corresponding building.  I enjoy this game very much.  It has multiple paths to victory and players have stimulating choices to make on their turn.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite eurogames: despite being relatively easy to learn, it is pretty deep, interactive, fast-paced (no downtime at all) and it has several balanced winning strategies. The market mechanic is superior over the more common market mechanic of Power Grid or Cuba because it is much more dynamic (you can exploit a high price much more by selling several goods for that high price, in contrast to Cuba) and you don't have to refill tokens on the market (more elegant than Power Grid). 

It hits the fine line of being meaty enough for the real geeks and still accessible for the more casual gamers ...

I am surprised why it is not that popular and why I didn't happen to play it earlier ...  

EDIT: One con is that the exploration can actually be neglected in order to win and that the exploration is somewhat linear and boring ...

Well I'm glad I played before I bought. Otherwise I would have wasted my money.

It's a fascinating and very well designed system. It's just not that fun of a game.

In particular, it just felt like you couldn't break out of the mold. I mean sure, you could be a colony whore, or a church whore, but you still needed those dang privileges to win.

And I love the math behind how the market works. I don't like the ~35 second pause everytime someone hit the market to do the math. Just felt clunky compared to the other actions that were lighting fast. (Almost felt like the Maneuver from Antike, but nowhere as near as bad.)

Still, it was much better than Hamburgam or Machu Pichu. There was still some diversification to be had.

Mainly it just fell so flat when contrasted with something like Hansa Teutonica. Each game of Hansa is a book unwritten. Navegador is a novel where you want to read the chapter no-one else is already reading.

RATING: 7
Great game with lots of pros and lots of strategy to win. Rondall system has much to discover and delivers such a tensed tempo. Scoring system terrible. Im done with Marc Gerdst's games. All of them has meaningless and ridicilous scoring system where it is far beyond rewarding and seperated from gameplay. It has very low replayability and market system is just primitive and about player buffing each other.

The story of game is based on the Age of Exploration, which is translated Grandes Navegacoes in Portuguess. The game has successfully narrated the Age of Discovery. Players get victory points mainly in five ways, pathfinding, colonizing, factory building, building dockard and missionary work. The game is very strategic and full of fun. Navegador is one of the best Rondel system games. Despite the high completeness of the game, the theme of the Age of Exploration is always a controversial issue. Players needs to realized what they are reconsider through the game. I can see that the author has earnestly tried to handle positive influence of the ear. In many ways, I agree Navegador is a good game to think over the history.

Solid, and the market mechanism is a clever and subtle graft onto the market mechanism.  Ultimately though, I think the rondel was the wrong way to restrict player choice in this particular game.  I think Gerdts would have been better served by moving away from the central conceit of his earlier designs and looked at other methodologies for limiting player options.

RATING: 6.5
The most important decisions you make will be which tracks you invest in, relative to other players. If you get lucky, you'll be the only person specializing in one or two tracks, and then you'll probably win. I've never seen someone who's been alone in a track lose, despite how well the opponents played.

RATING: 6
I'm not a fan of specialization paths in games, but here it doesn't bother me.  It's a decent design if quite unoriginal one.

After several changes of mind currently I consider it the best Gerdts' game.  There are others which are more innovative, but N. wins by being just solid and apparently more replayable than 'Imperial' and 'Hamburgum' (both of which I sold).

Better with 3 than with 5 players.  More control.
They say it's also good with 4.  Maybe some day I'll check it.

Eigen spel, gespeeld in de Bokkensprong 16/12/'16. Tactisch kolonisatiespel met veel verschillende strategieën. In je beurt speel je een van de acht acties op de rondel; de eerste drie zijn gratis; latere acties kosten een schip. Met schepen ontdek je nieuwe zeegebieden, waardoor ook kolonies in zicht komen. Je kan spelen op kolonies, fabrieken, ontdekkingen, scheepswerven, of kathedralen. Via een slim marktsysteem stijgen en dalen de grondstofprijzen voor goud, suiker en specerijen wanneer grondstoffen resp. van of op de markt genomen/gebracht worden. Knap spel; aan het eind wordt het wel wat rekenwerk om de voordeligste opties te kiezen, wat tot wachttijden kan leiden (en wat sommige spelers minder leuk vinden). De rondel en het marktsysteem zijn super; het is echt plannen en keuzes maken.

Cool game. The rondel is a really fun action selection system, and this game in particular makes really good use of it. I really like how you can specialize in certain things and tailor your end game scoring in whatever direction you like. I love how the economy is so symbiotic, you really need to figure out what other people are doing and do something different. If everyone is pushing hard on a certain kind of colony, than the corresponding processing plants will be very valuable. Because of how the map is structured the first person to get around Africa and sell spices will be able to sell them for a lot. The end game triggers are also interesting, and important to be able to predict since they can come up pretty quick after a relatively leisurely mid-game.

Excellent mechanics makes players looking for different economic strategies to improve their earnings and score victory poins.  It plays fast (around 90 minutes) with a very little downtime. Very very good with 3/4 players (not tried yet with 5).

After two plays, I'm not entirely sure what to think about this. While I enjoyed it both plays, it seems like the game is mostly about deciding how to best to specialize, and that once you've picked a specialty there isn't really a whole lot of room change that. I think my enjoyment was in the newness of it, and I'm a little skeptical that this has much replayability.

One of my favorite games. I really enjoy the rondel mechanic, and the way the parts of the game fit together and make sense (like losing one of your ships as a cost of exploring a new region).

There are good rondel games and there are rondel games which aren’t quite as good.  Happily Navegador  falls into the former category.   The market is the outstanding feature, with competing pressures to push certain goods down in price by selling them, or up by processing them.  There’s also a tension between exploring new regions and colonizing the ones which already exist.

Navegador reminds me most of Hamburgum, which I don’t like as much, but without some of the more irritating aspects of Hamburgum like the race to get buildings first and the pedestrian map.  Navegador is much more thematic, a focus which is welcome.

I’ll play gladly but likely not purchase.

While enjoying Antike and (in particular) Imperial I haven't picked up any of Mac's previous non-conflict games, but this one looked good enough to tempt me.

Good economic/exlporation game based on the age of Portuguese exploration that employs the rondel well. There are usaully many tempting options and you need to be both strategically and tactically flexible.

Strategically you want to avoid ploughing the same furrow as the others, especially those on your right. If they're going for sugar colonies, go for sugar factories or gold colonies; if they're going for shipyards and factories, go for churches and exploration etc.

The value of the market action varies tremendously turn-by-turn based on what the others have done. A strong economic base is very helpful so you need to know when to cash in and when to leave it for a while.

Yet to see a dominant strategy - which is good and suggests the game has legs.

I rather enjoyed this title.  The rondel mechanic works well in this game.  Between it and the decision to pull bonus tiles I think there's a lot of interesting decisions to be made.  The Navegador tile is clever as well.  As an added bonus it plays decent at two.

Like Concordia, a game that is fairly straightforward (rules wise) but - at least after my initial play - one with a good chunk of depth.

I love the tailored scoring, via the use of the privilege. It's less obtuse that the card scoring in Concordia but you can still tell it's by the same designer.

This is a top, top euro.

Still not sure why it's called Navegador, maybe it should be called Casa da India? Anyway, the gameplay could be almost anything relating to sea and transport. Not really about discoveries as the name implies, but actually about the establishment of the factories that followed the actual discoveries period.

RATING: 8
Good game! This is right up there with Concordia for me (which is quite high) and has further increased my admiration for Mac Gerdts as a designer. The rondel works excellently, and the Navegador bonus tile that moves around in reverse turn order is a nice feature as well.

In my opinion, the real star of this game is the market with the changing prices for producing vs. processing the resources. It makes for some interesting decisions as you try to choose which resources to focus on based on the plantations and processing buildings other people are using. Love this game!

After playing the Salsa expansion for Concordia, I don't think I would ever choose Navegador over it. Still it is quite good!

Tentative rating after one play.  I like rondel games and this one seems to have some potential.  I also like the way the market works.  But its also got a lot of gamey-ness.  For example, the way that different phases of the game happen when ships pass a certain point.  I just don't like that - seems artificial.  Worse is the way the cost of buildings increase exponentially - its an obvious heavy-handed catch-up mechanism.  Compare this with Dominion (for example), where the catch-up mechanism is that as your deck fills up with VP cards it becomes harder to get more.  That's elegant.  Navegador is not.  Its like after some playtesting someone decided that there was a bit too much runaway leader so they went for a simple 'fix' of escalating prices.  Boring.  The game keeps reminding you that you are only playing a game and not sailing the oceans.  MacGerdts has excellent ideas but he should get a new developer.

The second Gerdts rondel game I've played (1st was Hamburgum) and I like the system okay, but have my reservations in that it feels like the whole game is just fighting the rondel for efficiency of actions. Which maybe is the point, but I'm not convinced it's a great point, or that it should be the only point in a 90 minute game.

RATING: 8
Another good implementation of the rondel mechanism. Even the investor card from Imperial shows up in a new reiteration as the navegador card giving additional movement this time. Not as good as Imperial but way better than Antike. 
At its heart, Navegador is a classic eurogame of building up your engine of gathering resources, converting them to money and finally to VP's the most efficient. It pays out to focus on one area of development but it's mandatory to establish colonies and/or factories in order to generate cash. The varying values of the secret discovery tokens introduce a slight luck factor. This can screw one unsuspecting player early on if he discovers a low-priced colony and the player with the Navegador card buys it. The market for selling or manufacturing goods could have been more interesting. As it is, the decision on selling or manufacturing is obvious in that you don't want to leave high price opportunities for other players. 
The jury's out if this game is needed considering that it is at least the fourth incarnation of the rondel mechanism. I have to play Hamburgum to find out.

A neat rondel game,  with the colonization theme adding good differences from things like Imperial.  Apparently many paths to victory and lots of fun, I really liked it.

Like everyone else on BGG says, the rondel seems to be reaching a saturation point, but Navegador really does improve on all of the previous rondel games (with the possible exception of Imperial, which I have not yet explored enough to rate with full confidence).  The length is just about right and there really are multiple viable paths to victory.

Probably the only criticism I have is a very minor one, since it pertains to a lot of games.  You are definitely constrained by the player order, in that you have to choose your path based on what the other players have already chosen.  It would be really hard to win doing the exact same thing that another player is doing - you need to react and hopefully counteract what another player is doing.  I really like the market and factory and how they work together.  It is fun to have that work to your advantage, much to the other players' consternation.

Again, a very ho-hum theme, but you can't have it all, I guess.

The market is also interesting, it can be fun to screw over an opponent by selling a ton of goods and lowering the value right before he tries to.

This game is a true work of art: everything is intertwined, streamlined, fat free. Despite that, the game has some amazing mechanisms: the rondel, which is ordered in such a way that you can't optimize all of your turns; the scoring by multiplication, which is also very competitive to get tokens for; the market, which self-balances and forces you to choose between a balanced economy, which assures you a consistent income, or a specialized one, which means your Market phase will pay a lot, but you won't decide when to do them, but you'll be at the market's will.

Plus, it has a really quick pace, turns take under a minute, and so downtime is consistently low.

RATING: 6
En economic model and engine game with an almost linear exploration track. The significance of actions is initially opaque, but success seems to boil down to: a) specialization, b) doing what no one else is doing, and c) most particularly not doing what the player on your left is doing. Three may not be the ideal player count, since there are only two "engines" and whoever doesn't have to compete should benefit greatly. Slightly mathy market operations. Quite attractive overall.

Update: Fun also with four, but the game ends very quickly after you reach the spice colonies.

Enjoyable game with a unique mechanic, the Rondel. I enjoy the Rondel thoroughly and think that it is a simplified way in which to select from a vast array of choices. This game very well may be an 8 with more plays, and is one I'm hoping to play with 4 players at some point as I have only played with 2 and 3. The economic engine you can build is rewarding and the limited ways that you can interact with your opponent make this a game worth playing.

Good strategy game with the by now classic Mac Gerdts rondel mechanism. The actions on the rondel are nicely placed and lead to interesting choices. I also like the resource market. The game end can become a bit of an anti-climax as the game tends to drag during a couple of rounds without a lot of remaining meaningful actions (maybe due to new players and a wrong timing for the endgame).

What is interesting in Navegador is not carrying out a strategy, but in the early game deciding what strategy to go for. Each turn will change which is the best strategy to pursue and you must be flexible and study the game state well. 

As the game goes into the middle and end you must run your strategy (the easy part), while timing all your moves to best take advantage of when is best to do things like privilege, sailing, markets, or anything really, because since you have to do it all (or just about) choosing when to do one thing affects when you do the more contested things. 

Excellent game that I always plan to play. A true test of skill and something that will not get old to play if all the players understand where the heart of the game lies.

A solid euro that's fairly unforgiving & where newbies' mistake will benefit one, but not all of the other players.  For me, it suffers from the same combo I do not like in Shadow of the Emperor: Hidden scores + Players fighting for points from a common pool.  You take points from other players (colonizing where they could have, grabbing the multiplier they also needed, taking the buildings that are worth a lot to them, etc.) all the time.  Since the scores are just totaled at the end, it's easy to take from the wrong person and fail at balancing the scores.  At any given point, doing the right thing would really involve taking out pen and paper and counting how many points each player has, which is totally viable since all that info is public, but completely impractical.  So games end up being won by a handful of points which could have gone to someone else but didn't because bothering to get accurate information to decide your play is enough tedium to make the game not fun.  There's a lot to like in there, but that kills it for me.

LIKE:

* There appears to be several different paths to victory available in the game.
* Your plan needs to reflect what other people are doing, particularly those of your righthand neighbor!  You do not want to get stuck trying to do the same thing as him/her.
* Rondel appears well implemented in this game.  I felt like there was a viable and valuable option almost the whole game no matter where I was positioned on the rondel.
* Stock market mechanic is nicely implemented.  I could see where this area could be manipulated to some degree at a cut-throat level.  

DISLIKE:

* While I see the value of the Navegador tile (needed to counteract early player advantage to some degree), I am not sure how much I like it in play the whole game.  There is potential for it to mess up well laid plans depending on how and WHEN people choose to use the tile and it's ability.
* Not sure how I feel about the randomness of the distribution of the plantation tiles.  I understand the desire to provide and explore concept to the game and the uncertainty that comes with exploring, but every time I explored (4 times), I turned over high cost plantations.  Blargh!

In the end, I think this is one of those games for which I'd love to trade BUT not so much buy.

Really nice game mixing economics and exploration. An important thing to note is that it has very little, if any, conflict. Which may be great for some and terrible for others (including my wife, sadly). So, this is all about the group - this is a great game to play with those couples who bicker when they're involved in conflict :)

Update (11/2016): For some reason this game was unplayed for quite some time, perhaps a couple of years, and I finally played it again. While it's not as good as Imperial (well, not many games are), I still think it's way more interesting than most "modern euros".

A beautiful game, with all the wooden components and the map! Has almost no luck and most of the game is about reacting to your opponents and adapting to the changes they make.

I have to thank Rahdo for his amazing run-through, which ended up convincing me to get this game.

Though the lack of random set-up and the fact that it's a long game, makes it hard to take to the table.

RATING: 7.5
A nice euro, with mechanics nicely tied to the theme. I liked the two phases, where people were first exploring, and then developing their economy: this makes sense thematically. The end of the game was anticlimactic: a point salad, and it was not clear why the winner had won, and we were relatively tied.

The market is well designed, the rondel nicely limits choices.

A nice euro, but that lacks for me the richness of the cards in Agricola, or even of the tableaux in Race for the Galaxy, not to mention that of the cards in Magic: the Gathering and of the battleground in Warhammer: Diskwars.

We ended up getting this from our Secret Santa and finally got it to the table.  With the two of us, we used Tom Lehmann's suggested variant (found [thread=671709]here[/thread]), which seemed to work quite well.  It took us about half of a game to really pick up on what was going on---what's nice is that there are really only seven actions that you have to know.  Even then, your available actions are generally constrained by the rondel to the next three spots.  This makes each turn relatively quick and helps to cut down on analysis paralysis.  However, although the actual actions are relatively easy to learn, it does take a little bit to pick up on how each action affects the others.  It's a remarkably subtle game---each action is tightly intertwined with the others.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the market, where the prices of the three resources (sugar, gold, and spice) are explicitly affected by selling from colonies and then processing using factories.  This makes the game feel very dynamic---it's not just about sailing and exploring, but there's this engine underneath the game that you have to understand.

We found that with two players, the game has a very pleasant feel.  Generally, we both end up focusing on several of the five scoring categories, but even with two you still have to keep an eye out on what your opponent is doing.  I can see how with more players, the gameplay might be even more dynamic---for example, with more players, the market would fluctuate much more.  Still, we enjoyed it as a two player game (although I do wonder about replayability over the long haul, since there isn't too much randomness to the game---will we end up settling for familiar strategies?)

Brilliant game. Love the rondel and love the commodity market. I like how every move your opponent makes is important to pay attention to and if you mimic everyone's move you will fall furthur and furthur behind. Need more plays but am already looking forward to the next session.

Edit: Ooo, had my second game, and it felt completely different. However, it's going to be a 7 because it's not a game which excites me as much I thought it would.

Much more straight forward than the other rondel games, and partly as a result, much quicker too. The map funnels the action inexorably towards the East, with limited but interesting choices along the way. This funneling also helps make the game quick as things are not as free form as the other rondel games. Rondel Distilled! (2012-10)

So hard to tell the difference between the Orange and Yellow factories in most lighting. Painted mine Purple using a Sharpie, great.

I am enjoying this so far.  Our second game was far different, and far more interesting, than our first game when none of us had any feel for the possible strategies to pursue.  I'm encouraged by this because there seem to be some interesting strategies to explore, and room to improve my game play, which are qualities of a game I tend to value.  I'm rating it a "7" for now, knowing that this rating is likely to move up or down depending on how much depth this game shows after several more plays.  In summation, Navegador is a promising title, but it is too early to declare this the designer's best effort - Imperial currently holds that spot.

A very interesting rondel game. The linear format of a rondel is accentuated by the linear manner of exploration and trade in this game. No need to own this but I will happily play it again. I particularly enjoyed the sort of 'smash n grab' mindset you need to try and beat others to ports.

I'm totally uncertain about how Mr. Gherdts does it. It's yet a totally new take on using the rondel, or at least building a game around it. 

It's essentially set collection and each set on your personal tableau gives additive bonuses to the sets of buildings and colony tiles you collect. The buildings also expand other abilities on the rondel as your sets of them burgeon in size.

The sugar, gold, and spice "shacks" are used in conjunction with the colonies to either sell good and devalue the market or the shacks serve to revalue it; either way you can make great money and careful diversification is necessary. 

I was hesitant and perhaps future plays will show it has some sort of limited staying power but the game was competitive and tense throughout, all players saw the other forks in the road they could have taken, and in all everyone agree about how good it was.

It's easily the second best in the series but could just as easily grow to be my favorite.

I like this game more and more after each play.  It is Portuguese exploration themed game.  You explore new seas and establish new plantations in the Americans, Africa and Asia. You can buy factories to sell factory goods or raw goods to the market.  Interest market that moves up and down based on what players sell.  You can also build cathedrals and ports.  It has many paths to victory and great scoring mechanism for end of game.  A great game from Mac Gerdts.

German di 90-120 minuti, tramite diverse azioni disponibili è possibile costruire navi, edifici, colonie, reclutare lavoratori, scoprire nuovi territori, ecc.. C'è un meccanismo di mercato con fluttuazione di prezzo dove è possibile fare soldi vendendo le merci delle colonie e quelle prodotte dalle fabbriche costruite.
A fine partita tutto fa punti, ma è possibile specializzarsi "comprando" dei moltiplicatori di punteggio per delle singole categorie dove ci si è sviluppati maggiormente.

Each time I play [i]Navegador[/i], I enjoy it a little more than the last play.  The exploration, though simple, does have some "exploring" in that you flip the random colony tiles when you enter a new ocean/sea.  The market works well, quite dynamic, but quick.  And after long games of [i]Imperial[/i], having a rondel game that takes less than 90 minutes is great.  That said, I am a bit bored of it as a two-player game so it hasn't hit the table that often recently.

Based on two plays I think this is one of the better rondel games from Mac Gerdts. I am really fond of the rondel mechanism since it makes the game flow quickly even with 5 players. 
This is an intense game loaded with strategy, interaction and different paths to victory. Even tho it feels like a game where you have to explore the seas in the first play there soon relveals several alternatives for gaining victory points. 
It is a game deep into the Euro category and no combat what so ever all interaction are at competition and economic level. Great game with seemingly lots of replayability. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a solid game. The rondel mechanism means there is a cost to playing a focussed strategy that makes for interesting decisions, the market fluctuations place an emphasis on timing, and competition for limited resources makes this game more directly competitive than is common in Euros. However, the theme is uninspired (even if it is well-researched), and the artwork, though attractive, is also somewhat bland. These factors don't reduce my enjoyment of the game in any way, but they do cause it to get overlooked when choosing what game to play, and consequently this game does not see the frequency of play that it ought to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game that has some weak elements. Smooth and interactive gameplay but it can last too much if no one is into exploration; the market is interesting and interactive but can became quite static according to what players choose as main strathegy. It scales bad: in 2 player games, Navegador lacks tension and all decisions until half game seem obvious. After you choose wheter go for colonies or factories, the market keeps on going up and down the same way and it becomes predictable.

First impression after 2 x 4p games online.  This is an almost zero luck strategic game.  The rules overhead is a little more than I usually like and the choices are not as intuitive as I would like.  However, this game is very interesting and exciting.  Good degree of interaction for a Euro.  It's not MPS -- although you don't feel like you can directly affect a player your strategy and actions affect all players.  Definitely lots of right/left binding that make the game in part group dependent.  Learning curve.  Beautiful components/map although not easy to decipher until one has some practice playing the game.  This game put Mac Gerdts on my radar -- I had heard many good things about his designs and this corroborates those positive reviews.

Nice game, but the rondel can feel unsatisfactory at times (that's not a gripe with Navegador but with rondels in general) and you might get royally screwed in the goods market in a 5p game.

Interesting game that makes thematic sense. 

Plays pretty fast because the rondel system keeps options to choose from, low. Yet you have a lot of tough decisions to make. 

Rules are not too complex, but what bothers me after a few plays is that adjusting the market isn't always straightforward and everybody struggles with it. It takes at least a lot of attention during the game, and spoils the fun a bit.

But for the rest Navegador IS a lot of fun ! It feels like a race but actually it isn't.

A much more appealing adaption of the rondel into an economic game than Hamburgum was. Since I’ve only played each of them once, I’m a bit at a loss to pinpoint why, but the narrative arc in Navegador with its three stages of exploration and increased variety of trade goods is both intuitive and varied. Hopefully, more plays will allow me a more detailed view on this.

After 3 plays (2, 2, & 5):
The game can be intimidating to look at when it hits the table.  And the rules are fiddly enough to maintain the impression that it is a complicated game. But once you get the hang of it, I find it moves at a good pace.

It's essentially set collection where most of the skill comes down to timing and displined execution of your strategy.  I like the theme and art, however, the play is slightly dry for my tastes (I don't mind too much as it actually sticks within the 60 - 90 minute range listed). I could see the potential for AP with the wrong crowd though.

The components are beautiful but the game is boring, boring, boring. First, there is way too much math. Every action has the players tallying up score after score - YAWN. Second, the game seems wide open at first, but after your first couple of decisions you had better stick with your strategy, as there is no hope of making a comeback if you try something new.  Third, The market system seems to be pretty interesting until you actually play. The game severely punishes those players that share markets. Fourth, this isn't an elegant, intuitive, psychological game. You better count every point from every action you can take to determine the best course of action. A drudgery of a game, even in awesome company.

A few plays under my belt now, and I really enjoy it. It's solid with 2, but would be even better with more.  With 2-players, sailing becomes a necessity.  There is some interesting engine building that feels different from some of my other games..

Very pleasant game, nicely executed, but plagued with what ruins a lot of Euro for me. There are six or so completely valid paths to victory balanced to death. It's fun while you are discovering the possibilities, after that the game stalls. Against newcomers it's shooting newbies in a barrel, with three or four seasoned players it's about nuances, and quite anticlimactic. You stick to one strategy, hustle a bit at the start, but don't have the possibility to make big moves after the first few rounds. Not a bad game, but I prefer games with more freedom and interaction, like Carson City or Troyes.

After one play,  I have a feeling I am really going to enjoy this game.  The way there are so many options, yet they are somewhat limited by the rondel, and the way all your choices are intertwined and affected by the choices of other players...It is not a complex game to understand, and yet there seems to be some great depth to the game.  While some may feel it is a limited game with the same base set up each time or the potential for AP because of all the choices, this game is right up my alley.  Now if I can just find people to play it with me!

One of Gerdts' strongest rondel offerings.  The commodity market which has players driving prices up and down works much better than the markets we see in other games.  You really need to pay attention to player order (the player in front of you) to choose a feasible market strategy.  The great thing about this design though is that you don't even really need to invest too heavily in the market to compete.

The market has 3 goods (sugar, gold & spices).  Players gain these goods by moving their ships around the board and purchasing plantations on colonies.  Ships that first enter a new territory receive extra income and a navigator token.  

For each plantation you own you can sell the good it produces by using the Market action.  This moves the prices down in the market.  Players can also invest in factories which process goods and moves the prices of those goods up in the market.  You just cannot sell and process the same good during your market action.

There are a number of ways to score points and generally speaking you want to pick one or two strategies and then collect privileges for those strategies.  Privileges act as bonus VP multipliers at the end of the game.  You can score in Churches (that provide you with cheaper workers), Shipyards (that provide you with cheaper ships), Colonies, Factories, Money, Ships, Workers (that allow you to take privileges, colonize and purchase buildings) & Exploration tokens.

Although my first impression was very strong, my major concern, if it comes to pass, is that it seems one wants to choose a strategy that fits with what other players are doing (as you don't want to compete directly with too many players). Sticking with that strategy your moves around the rondel would be largely programmed.  So I'm not too sure about this game's long-term replay value.

I thought that the rules a reasonably simple but give rise to interesting gameplay and decisions. Unfortunately my wife seems to hate to game and refuses to play it again. This is bad news for a game that, to me, is a meaty but not overly long choice above gateway and standard games.

After soloing with five players I am now a bit less convinced that players can really specialize all that much. For quite a while you have to do what everyone does just to get a steady income. From then on, focusing on workers or ships may give some benefits but it did not seem huge. It does seem beneficial to grab an early ship or worker production, and that would limit specialization due to scarcity of tokens (especially as one cannot go all out from the start).

If I'm going to play a fairly traditional euro engine-building game, it might as well be Navegador.

Now THIS is the kind of Euro I can enjoy. The historical theme works well as you progress through the three discovery phases. It doesn't take too long to play. Different but not overwhelmeing number of areas of focus to gain VP's. I love the rondel approach (first rondel game for me) and the challenge of the decision making. Top class components. The rules were pretty clear. Lovely game.

Navegador no discurre sobre una balsa de aceite, es un continuo achique de agua. Todo ello sin perder de vista al resto de jugadores a los prácticamente no se les entorpece de forma agresiva mas allá de las fichas de exploración, los privilegios. Sin dejar caer en el olvido que podemos precipitar el fin de la partida, una forma abrupta de dar por terminada la experiencia, quizá sea el único elemento que chirría un poco en el conjunto.

Not a clean medium euro like Hamburg, not a challenging heavy tense game like Imperial, but a game with nice mechanics, where you are "always" playing, making decisions, and trying to optimize and master the actions and bonus taken from the Rondel.

A wonderful little Rondel game.  The actions are easy to explain, and the two market actions ensure that the market can always be manipulated.  While ostensibly about exploration and colonization, manipulating the market is actually at the heart of the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Rondel player-driven market game.

3 different products, you explore and settle different locations to produce materials which are then processed through factories (built by players). The market mechanism promotes cultivating economy that is lacking as opposed to jumping on the band-wagon.

Also, plays reasonably well with 2 players.

Sounds like an upgrade from Hamburg.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love how market prices move up and down depending on whether you activate factories to consume the products or plantations to supply the products.  I enjoy the challenge of buying the right mix of factories and plantations while carefully timing my visits to the market right after another player sets the prices to my advantage.

I tend to enjoy all of Mac Gerdts' rondel games, and this one might be my favorite.

Another "rondel" masterpiece!  Caravelas and Navegador in the same year?  Not surprising, I guess, given how boardgame designers seem to repeat similar themes, over and over, again . . . also, it is reminiscent of Hollywood churning out similarly themed movies in the same year (e.g., Armageddon and Deep Impact, Wyatt Earp and Tombstone, etc.).  Anyway, I love a good exploration game (ever since Conquistador) and this has some unique mechanics that makes it very worthwhile.

Still thinking about this one. Heavily dependent on turn order, and also the pressure of the rondel and handover of the Navegador card, so it can feel like you are dealing with very prescripted actions where the exact order and timing in relation to other players matters a lot. Takes a bit of time to grasp the market interactions: colonies flood the market with goods (driving prices down for raw goods, but making factories that rely on raw goods more profitable); factories flood the market with produced goods (driving prices down for more products but up for more raw goods from the colonies). The main tip for newbies would be: don't get a factory and colony of the same type (since you are not allowed to both produce AND sell the same type of good in a single market action, so one of your investments will go to waste), and try to get the opposite of what other players are investing in, especially if they are earlier in turn order (so if they get a gold colony, either get a sugar colony or a gold factory, so you get better prices in the market). -- It is an elegant system, as you'd expect from Gerdts, and has just enough randomness to avoid repetitive play (as colonies vary wildly in value). Players will do best if they figure out their role in the game ecosystem and avoid competing directly on the same turf as opponents--if one player buys up lots of factories, go into colonies or exploration, or buy different types of factories. Snag privileges whenever you can without fatally depleting your workforce.

Major issue I can see is that there's no timer to the game beyond people scooping up buildings or exploring to the end of the board. Unlike Concordia, which flat out gives you 7 VPs for triggering endgame, the reward for doing so here is subtler and more situational: you get the last move, which will presumably mean you bought the last building (and thus can if nothing else go to market for a shower of money for points on the last move) or picked up the last explorer token (and thus can buy up the last few colonies or go to market on the last move). 

Playing Navegador online at Yucata means that it's always visible who's in the lead--and this is a game where the gap between players simply widens as the game goes on. There is no catch-up mechanic to boost a second-rate engine. Playing in real life probably obscures that fact a lot more. I like knowing exactly where I stand in a game at all times, but your tastes may vary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a fun enough game, but it really does seem as though all of the interesting decisions are made in the first three or four turns. Once the players have collectively worked out their positioning / phasing among the main strategic tacks, the only real thing left to do is let the game run its course. Most of the player decision-making from that point on is fairly obvious, and the only people with tougher decisions to make are those who are in bad positions and probably won't be able to recover anyway. There are a couple of minor timing decisions, but basically your early game decisions are going to put you into a fairly straight-forward 3- or 4-stop path around the rondel that you really don't veer very far from.

RATING: 5.8
Certainly not a bad game, just too heavy a Euro *for me.* I very much liked this designer's Imperial 2030, and I do enjoy games featuring colonization, like El Capitan. This version, while fast playing, is simply too abstracted for me and made me long for AoE3.

I just played this game for the first time and was impressed. There are no dice or cards involved so luck plays little in the game play. The only luck factor is in the random way the colonies are distributed on the map.

The rondel mechanism is an elegant way for players to decide what actions to execute. The comodities market is an interesting take on supply/demand economics.

There are multiple strategies that a player can employ while playing this game. In my game there were 4 players.  The winner focussed on generating enough money to build churches, which he used to obtain cheaper workers, which he used to obtain privilege multipliers on churches. At the end he racked 54 points (6 churches x 9). I took the more traditional route of building ships, exploring and colonizing. It was good enough for 2nd place. Another player monopolized the gold market by building all the gold factories. This strategy did expose one flaw in the game; there was not enough money provided. We had to use 1000 coin token (from another game) to give the gold baron. 

I can not wait for the next chance to play this game.

4 player game. We thought the game was great during the first hour, than we discover that we have to force the end game, but nobody want to do it, because there are none incentives to finished it. The scoring is made at the end of the game, and we were not sure who was the leading player. So during the last 30 minutes sallying just didn't make any sense, and we start to get everything that was in the board to get more points. The game dragged a lot at the end, and after a great hour and half of play it starts to get really boring. 
I will play it again, just to make sure that it's finished is always like this. If it is, my rating will go down.

ok, second game, the game didn't dragged at the end, but the player who finished lost to me by 2 points. the VP that he will win with the lost to ships to end the game. Seems the sailing end game condition is not very well solved. I will leave my rating as it is for now. 
Must to play it again. The game have a lot of options to chose, and the rondel works really well. will see what it will happen in future plays.

The best game in the Rondel series, and unlike other games in this series, this game asks you to identify your position and rewards you for mostly sticking with your decisions, rather than being an all-tactical game. 

Unlike other Rondel game, it's much harder to not follow the Rondel as the extra cost is quite steep. This is not a bad thing, as players have to craft a smooth path to get their things done, rather than just sacrificing things to do the same thing over and over.

In this Rondel game of 16th cenury Portugal, one is taking advantage of the sugar, gold and spice trade to make money, while trying to increase their workers and buildings, while exploring further in the world. 

This is the best game of the Rondel series. You have to be very precise in the opening moves, and after that there are different strategies to pursue. There is a "Navegador" mechanic where the last turn player gets to sail for free, then passes on the Naegador ability to balance the first turn player advantage.

There are a lot of things to think about and each game is tense and exciting. I'm looking forward to more plays.

I thought I might really like this one, and I did, until about halfway through the game. In order to do well, you need to specialize in something. The problem is that by specializing, your gameplay options get very limited and you wind up doing the same thing over and over from about mid-game up until the end. I would gladly play this again to see if I'm wrong, but I don't see how it could work out any differently unless you were playing just to participate instead of to win.

Game offering a lot of choices, with almost absent dependence on luck. To win at this game strategy is more important than tactic, in a way that I like.

UPDATE
Raised rating to 10 after playing more times. Strategic in a nicer and deeper way than it appears in the first games. And fast and beautiful to play. The best of the rondel games, together with Imperial. Very recommended.

While I like this rondel game better as a game than Antike, it's less fun.  This is another exercise in system optimization, this time in determining which element you're planning to maximize.

Folks, we need a new game model.  Opt-engines are getting really fucking boring.  We remember our first ones and we remember our favorites -- like girlfriends -- but if you're a new one coming out onto the market, you better bring something new to the dance.

Also, when creating a game, consider having a theme.  This one, once again, painted on like so much whitewash.

Not sure about this one yet. Having multiple paths to victory is cool, but it seems like it's just whoever manages to get the best money engine. I think you need to get at least one cathedral, since it's so expensive to get people otherwise. Probably getting to five people sooner is the way to go. Not sure if navigation is a great strategy since it costs so much to get the ships onto the board, unless you commit to boat building. But, then you'd be neglecting the other houses, so probably not the way to go. Need more plays, though.

Quick and smart roundel game. The market mechanism is simply brilliant and encourages commerce relationships with the other players.

Un buon titolo, anche se lo metto sotto Imperial e Antike. Apprezzabile il tentativo di rendere il gioco più breve dei precedenti e ampliare le strategie per arrivare alla vittoria. Personalmente però penso che differenziare i metodi per fare punti vittoria non sia produttivo, quindi lo sviluppo della partita potrebbe diventare ripetitivo con i giocatori che fanno ogni tre turni le stesse mosse. Ho visto partite dominate da giocatori che producevano chiese e industrie senza mai toccare il mare!

I really enjoyed my first play of this. I had heard some issues about balance, so I had mixed expectations going in the first game. Whether it's true or not, it really feels like you can develop multiple strategies. This probably stems from the end-game scoring where you have control over both the absolute number of achievements you have earned as well as the score multipliers. Even if it's not true, it _feels_ like it is, so the game is wide-open space for players to romp around in.

Je begint met een startkapitaal maar vlug genoeg besef je dat dit (net zoals in het echte leven) erdoor vliegt.
Op zich heb je na een paar beurten de "flow" van het spel wel door ... daar zit de moeilijkheid in dit spel zeker niet.
Zoals bij zovele spellen is planning essentieel . Maar laat dat nu net hetgene zijn dat niet evident is, daar je wel eens afhankelijk kan zijn van wat de speler voor u doet. Natuurlijk heb je niet dezelfde strategie zal je niet makkelijk in iemand anders zijn vaarwater komen

This is because you get to "buy" the victory point multipliers in the investment types (colonies, factories, explorations, shipyards, churches/workers) that you wish to specialise in. The initial game is about getting your money engine going first, and then players start to diverge along different investment types. From then on, there's a continual question of how often do you allow yourself to get "distracted" doing turns that allow you to get victory points that aren't in your main specialisation, 'cause that could get you or cost you the game. Turns go pretty fast. I like the new market mechanic which moves prices either way depending on how you sell. There's no gripping tension, and no direct pussage. It simply provides the challenge of organising yourself over the long haul, over many, many actions, as best you can. Which can start getting a bit tiresome upon replay, going (in your best Murray Walker voice) round and round and round ... doing much the same things. I prefer it with more players because you're more racing against other players to get that next shipyard / church / colony before them, eyeing off where they're up to to help you decide what to do next (ie how fast should you circle the rondel). With fewer players it feels more like you're fighting the rondel for efficiency rather than the other players with each player specialising in their own strategy.

Generally a good somewhat-heavy, low-interaction euro. However, it really dragged at the end of our game, where one person could end the game at any moment, or could choose not to, meaning the end was very uncertain. An "express" variant in the 60-90 minute range would be much better. Our game with some first-timers took 120, but felt longer.

I think the 3.0 weight is about right. The terminology of "selling" and "processing" is confusing.

This is one of the four EuropeMasters games 2011. Unfortunately after competing in EuropeMasters you are fed up with theese games. 

Another "roundel" game by Gertds. Works fine. A game which ends when it should. No feeling of too little "time" and too much to do, and no dragging on.

Rating after 1 play: Nice game with the usual "Rondell" by Mac Gerdts. It works fine and the gameplay is very fluid (as with the other Rondell-Games). But I think it doesn't offer anything new. Still a very solid effort. Rating may be differing with additional plays.

Chose your action on the action wheel and try to accumulate different buildings or tokens which will later earn points. You can focus on one thing or spread out what you collect and ensure to watch what the others do as it will effect how easily you can gain points and money. Similar mechanics to many other games, but still a fairly original feel.

This is the first Mac Gerdts "rondel" game that I've really liked.  Players use their boat tokens to explore the world, from South America and Africa all the way out to Japan.  While exploration is a good source of points, you can also set up colonies on the various explored regions to produce raw materials, or buy factories to process raw materials.  The game features and supply-and-demand track, in which prices go up if raw materials are produced and go down if they're processed.  The game encourages you to specialize, but you can't do so too much because of the rondel, and the more people following the same strategy, the worse that strategy will be.  The game ties together very well despite everything that's going on.  I really enjoyed this.

What a smooth and well thought out game. The actions are simple yet each move is agonizing. You really have to watch how long you're taking to get around the windrose. Focusing on a strategy seems to be the way to win instead of going for a little of everything. I liked it more with 4 players, but it becomes much tougher. 2 players is still great regardless of how well it's received.

Another 3-player and a 4-player game. The 8 still stands, at least for now..

Only one 3-player game so far. Initially this feels like a great game. 

My only concern is the movement of ships: always from west to east - will this feel repetitive and will it have an impact on replayabillity? (Yes, I know you may move your ships the other way also, but those movements should be the same as "less optimal" sailing actions, like you realize you have missed an oppertunity in the first place?)

Great with 4, ok with 2 and a mixed bag with 3.  In  3-player game if 2 players overlap on a  strategy for even a  short time, they basically hand the game to the third player. This is probably mitigated by experienced players. The game has a beautiful map, interesting player interactions and a frustratingly large box.

My favorite among the rondell games I've played (Navegador, Antike, and Imperial), and not as cut-throat (nor as unintuitive) as Imperial. I tend to enjoy it, but it feels like it takes too many turns to accomplish much. Still, turns go pretty quickly, and there are plenty of decisions to make, so you can do different things (and change tactics) based on what the other players are up to. Thematically, it works, though some game mechanics (esp. the workers) are on the fiddly side.

Very enjoyable game with an engaging theme. Strategies seem very balanced and the decision each turn as to which action to select is always interesting. Mac Gerdts gets criticised for his love of the rondel mechanism but it works very well here (as in most of the games where he uses it, to be honest) and there's great tension between wanting to advance slowly and take every action or rush round to take one or two actions more often. This is a really good and somewhat underrated game.

Excellent rondel game. The rondel makes actions limited, short and sweet, but also adds a lot of strategic considerations. It makes it so there's always something you can do to further your own position, but the player who can most easily skip spaces and race around the rondel is in a very good position.

What sets this game apart from others is that all players will have different strategies. One player will explore, build wharfs and ships, while another is happy sailing after them and pick up the colonies, and a third doesn't sail at all and builds factories and churches. In fact, not doing what others are doing is the way to success. You can't plan your strategy in advance, but have to adapt to what the other players are (not) doing. 

It's ultimately an efficiency game. You want to focus as much as possible, don't waste actions, and have enough income that you can spend your actions on points instead of money. There is a lot of player interaction, but if you can avoid interacting with your opponents that's probably a good idea. So it's all fairly linear, once everyone has figured out what they want to be doing. But if you like managing your actions, resources and future options, you'll like Navegador.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I found the second play with 5 more interesting than with 2 because of the competition for the resources, so I had to focus on the profitable gaps i.e. the often mentioned comment of doing something no-one else is doing.

So instead of getting involved in the sailing on the crowded waters, the lottery of exploring and the colonising (which became expensive) I piggybacked on the market fluctuations with my meagre collection of colonies and factories whilst finding ways of generating income as the pressure of buying shipyards and churches increased. And I was surprised to find I was only 4 vps behind the winner.

Could it be a design to counter groupthink, I don't know and unfortunately it isn't a design I wanted to reflect and try to improve on because despite the interesting challenge of worming through to victory as well as the enjoyable, frustrating sequencing of the rondel, the scoring is too fractured and the multiplying nature of the vps makes the status of players opaque so no strong sense of the race, and with no hidden elements there is no exciting reveal.

In summary, the navigation is spacially the same and the experience dry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unlike the other rondel games, this one has random elements.  The randomness fits the exploration theme, but it's still a strike against the game in my book.

I'm going to wait until playing again before giving a numerical rating, but I fear that the strategies aren't very well balanced and some particularly uninteresting strategies (e.g., building buildings and the corresponding privilege at every opportunity) are extremely powerful.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After two plays, this is a contender for best game of 2010. Second only to Troyes, Navegador is, as best I can describe it, Puerto Rico grafted onto the Rondel system. 

Interactive in the same way as PR--watch your opponents, craft your strategy so as best to take advantage of their predictable actions, try to do something different from the player on your right.

Strategic, yet with tactical decisions.

Multiple, clearly defined strategies.

Left-right binding.

Early moves somewhat scripted based on a player's table position and what the other players do however, not as much as PR is scripted. Newbies who make too many mistakes early on may never be able to recover.

All of this adds up to a game where every move is important. Everything you do must be part of your goal, and deviation from your strategy can be very difficult to recover from. I like this kind of punishing aspect of games like PR, Age of Steam, and for me Navegador fits in quite nicely.

I am only hesitant to rate this higher initially because it does not look like it would scale well to 2 players. Like many of Gerdts' games, the zero-sum aspect makes the 2p experience a different beast and not something I enjoy in games of this type because it leads to too much calculation and downtime.

However, I do expect with more plays this could easily be a 9.

In this game, players use a roundel to take actions which involves sailing your ships around, hiring workers, constructing buildings and taking score multipliers to your board. The look of the game is nice, it has that classic euro game appearance. The rules are easy enough to follow. 

The game feels a bit long for the experience it delivers despite being relatively short. I'm sort of tired with the action options somewhere at the midpoint of the game as it has a lather rinse repeat feel. There are a few paths you can follow, but they're more or less equivalent to each other in terms of how they translate to endgame vp, and the feel of one road vs another isn't different. The game also offers very little variation game to game in terms of setup. There's nothing particularly bad or wrong with this game, it's just not very interesting or remarkable.

A lot of really cool mechanics, but not all strategies are equally viable. I wish exploration was a bit more key - I don't like that the game encourages slow exploration. This causes newbies to rush to Nagasaki to their detriment, since they tend to associate end-game state with 'good strategy.' I feel like this ought to be an equally viable strategy, if only so that you don't miss the whole point on the first game.

There are two flaws I see. First, the gold resource is too end-game heavy, so one of the resources just doesn't have the same utility. The other is that it just doesn't behoove you to try and get on both sides of the same resource supply - you're better off heavily investing in one direction and getting a higher multiplier of a low number than you are in diversifying on the same resource and making money either way it swings. No supply chain or vertical integration.

RATING: 5
I really like Mac Gerdts' designs because they stand out a bit from the samey JASE crowd. Navegador takes ideas from Imperial and Princes of Machu Picchu, but is easier to get to grips with than Imperial and far less convoluted than Princes. I like how fast it moves with only one action per turn and usually only three to choose between. It also has an interesting market that makes the game play a bit like Container; you need to find a niche that other people aren't filling, and a lot of the game is about timing. 

Interest reduced after 2nd play - strategic paths seem too confining and player who is left alone will likely win.

Not very keen on the 'theme' but the map looks gorgeous. Our game apparently was very unusual and it refused to end, although the excitemnt had been long (long!) gone already. One thing I don't like about the game is that there is not set limit of turns in the game, so that decision become more meanigful. Sometimes, people just keep going on and on and on, not ending the game and doing the same stuff over and over, hoping to catch up and that is just dull as I don't feel any progress or dynamic process is still going on in the game once everything is explored and players have settled for a tactic. So, to me, this is a failed design, but that is just me and I can see how some might like it. I am astonished about the lack of chance and randomness in the 'game' and people who know me are aware of the fact that a game without chance, is not in game in my definiton.

Not my cup of tea.

Tried to play through once a couple weeks ago. It was late so we only got part way through (NOTE: it's also not a good sign that bedtime has a stronger draw than the game).

In short, it was boring. I admit that 2p is a poor number for this game and because of that I'm going to refrain from giving the game a low rating, but I also feel that there just wasn't much to offer here. There's stuff you can do. That stuff gives you points. Most points wins. I've heard there are two single-line strategies for this game: (1) don't do what anyone else is doing and (2) benefit from the person to your right and screw the person to your left. Again, this makes it a poor game for 2p.

There was a thread on BGG recently that talked about why people rate games with luck lower and one comment was that some players like to assert mental superiority over others. That's the game. "I'm better at filling out this spreadsheet than you are. I win". We keep running into games like that and Navegador may fall into that category. Sure, you need to pay close attention to what the other person is doing, and there are ways to cause the player to your left some grief, but the grief is mostly just in not letting that person get quite as many points on this turn.

I think it's an excellent game. I'd give it a 7 or 8 if this was the kind of game we liked; however, we don't like this sort of game and it's extra boring for 2. Going on the for trade list.

= 2013-05-09 - R:3

Gave this a rating and traded it away. I've been complaining for a while that BGG favors boring, low-interaction, spreadsheet games. In the case of Glen More and Navegador, I acknowledged that they were well put together spreadsheets and if I liked that sort of game, I might give it a high rating. In both cases I then stated it wasn't a game for me and abstained from giving a rating at all. Today I decided I'm not going to do that any more. No more leniency for boring spreadsheets pretending to be games. This "game" sucked. Perhaps my poor experience with this byzantine abacus will remind me to ignore the BGG ratings in the future.

The upside:
-It's about Portugal in its prime. The theme is very special. It's beautiful represented in the art of the game.
-Cute market of commodities. It serves as an aditional consequence producer for your actions how it fluctuates.
-This games rewards specialization, follow the same course of action, using the same buildings,etc. Since there's more games doing the other way around, this counts as positive.

The downside:
-It doesn't fit on Imperial shoes.

I like the rondel mechanism; it's the Big Mac's games I'm not mad about. They're either overly economic, too long or, like Navegador, have 135 different ways to gain VPs.

A great game (easily an 8 in my book) but I just can't get it to the table enough.

I thought I was going to love this game because of the market manipulation, but it fell a bit flat after a few plays.  The church/factory strategy is too powerful and has won in each game I've played so far.  Also, the way victory points are scored by the multipliers seems a bit weird and unthematic.  The game designer should have leaned more towards finance and less toward euro-blandness.

Solid economic Euro game. I really like the market mechanism with the price (or rather the profit) for raw materials and processed goods. 

Unfortunately I am no fan of the core mechanism: Mac Gerdt's rondell for action selection. I think this is one of the most unthematic mechanisms. At first glance it might represent something like time and that you can perform a certain action only  once in a certain time frame. But then time is different for all players. My colonies only produce if I spent an action (time) for that. So this does  not really feel like an economy, which would give an automatic income stream. Interestingly, I had  the same feeling when playing Gerdt's new game Concordia, which substitutes the rondell with a deck of cards for limiting your action selection.

Start with worker and then privilege. Buy the colony not owned by next player.

Big Mac brings the rondel to a game about Portugese maritime exploration. Actions: 1) Sailing your ships -- the number of spaces moved changes by phase as the game progresses, and there is a natural attrition of one ship lost per fleet each time you enter uncharted waters, both great touches and in synch with theme; 2) Purchasing discovered colonies, allows you to sell goods for gold; 3) Buying workers (one of several forms of currency in the game); 4) using the Market to Produce goods from your factories or Sell goods for money (producing and selling essentially allow market price manipulation in one direction or the other; there are two of these spots on the rondel, so owning a number of Sugar factories and Sugar colonies could get you a nice money generating cycle); 5) Buying ships (whuch always start in Portugal); 6) Buying factories, churches, and shipyards (for resource processing, worker purchasing, and ship placement ostensibly, but more importantly act as huge VP generators at game end); and 7) Buying Priveleges -- there are limited ones available, but they act as multipliers for endgame scoring. Taking more than 3 steps on the rondel is more costly than in past games (you must remove a ship from the board) so mostly done near the end of the game. An optimization game with difficult decisions and a great deal to track. My favorite of the rondel games I've played from MG so far (Imperial, Hamburgum, Navegador, Princes).

Yes, it's a tight design. Yes, you can pull levers to optimize your economy and VP machine. Yes, the Rondel presents tough choices.

However, it's simply another VP engine game. Buy stuff. Sell stuff. Build stuff. Figure out the optimum allocation of stuff to generate VP.

I thought the handsome map meant there was an element of exploration and maneouver. Nope. No geography, history, or interraction. It's difficult for me to muster much enthusiasm for these spreadsheet games anymore.

I enjoyed this game. It has a simple circular trade (turn money into resources which you use to acquire other types of resources which you use to generate money) which works very well and is quite challenging. The trick is that everything in the game is worth victory points but not everything is worth equal amounts of victory points and you need over the course of the game to maximise your investment in the things that score the most victory points.
It is challenging without being overly competitive and relatively easy to pick up. The arithmetic on the market place is challenging by Euro-game standards (addition of three effectively 2 digit numbers) but I actually like that the game doesn't insult your intelligence in that regard.

Wow, that game really impressed me! The moves are simple and generally quick, but all the players constantly face the dilema of having to decide what to do next (you always want to do three things at once, but can only do one thing...).

8 might be a bit too high for this, but in my heart I know it doesn't deserve anything less.  I liked the game, but it felt like it was missing something to make it magical.  So close.  We played a 3-player game to the point where all of the buildings were sold, so the problem could have been that it was just too long of a session for this game.

RATING: 7
The obvious - another Rondel game.  The not so obvious - less direct competition in this game (don't attack other players) so a game of economic efficiency and trying to gain VPs for the lowest cost.  Better play will probably reveal market manipulation into the mix, but even the first plays were an engaging exercise.

I enjoyed this Mac Gerdts rondel game. I came to it after Concordia, and Navegador does feel like Concordia's father.

I think Concordia is the better game--it's less mathy and you can customize your play style by buying cards.  There's also a bit more direct player interaction by building, making it more expensive for other players to build where you already are.  

That said, Navegador neatly simulates an economy and is fun in its own way.  Navegador is more about trying to capitalize on doing what other players aren't doing, whereas Concordia is more about running your own strategy as efficiently as possible.

In the end though, I felt that there wasn't enough room in the collection for both. Whenever I wanted to play this style of game, I always preferred to play Concordia.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game, makes good use of the Rondel and uses many of the concepts from other rondel games in new ways.  I like the market the best and trying to time/plan your economy.  My friend was concerned it doesn't have enough re-playability as everything will be more or less the same each time.  It would be better if exploring had some unknown risk/reward.  It reduces exploring the far east to the same trade off as a starbucks franchise.

A very good game with the rondel once again providing a charming simplicity on the gameplay side, but choices galore when it comes to your strategy.

There's a lot of tactical reacting to the actions your opponents perform here, and I appreciate that you can usually see it coming a turn or two off and try to plan to take advantage of their moves. At the same time you're trying to think three or four moves ahead to keep your momentum going, so it's a good game that has you moving around a preplanned path torn between breaking off your preordained plan when opportunity comes knocking or resisting temptation.

There's good balance here, so you can try different strategies out game to game and enjoy the replay value out of that. 

Of the Gerdts Rondel games I still prefer Imperial and Imperial 2030, but this one is a completely different beast and comes in close behind. Navegador will probably be better accepted by gaming groups than the Imperial games (I've unfortunately experienced a dud Imperial game, plus there's the whole Investor card or no Investor card debate you have to agree to), and because it scales well from 2-5, and boy is there a lot to take in when you're playing with five. I see it getting a lot of play. One of the best games from 2010.

Mac Gerdt does it again with his famous rondel, this time in the Portuguese Golden Age. The players manage fleets, colonies, factories, recruit workers, and edificate buildings in order to get the most points at the end of the game. Probably the rondel game that feels the most different than the others.

Constantly interesting and tension-filled and fun. A meaty economics Euro with a little luck. Unlike some of the other rondel games, I felt like there was a good reason to hit every space on my way around, so the decisions seemed extra tough. 

Can't wait to play again. 

Played again: just as awesome.
In the last game the top 3 were separated by one point. Amazing, wonderful game. 

Fifth play saw the game end on all buildings being bought. First time for that. It did make for a long game, but I won, so...worth it!

Superb game - fascinating decisions to be made, and optimal strategy requires that you're aware what choices the other players make. Several ways to win - lots of strategic choices.

This was a game that I had wanted to play for a while and am happy that I finally did.  All of the choices on the rondel are great - the sign of a well-designed rondel.  There is plenty to do and lots of paths to victory.  The only real randomness is in the distribution of the colony tiles, which can be great fun when you score the big explorer bonus and watch your opponents get shafted with a cheap one.  The game seems to slow at the end, but I look forward to getting this to the table again soon.  It's rating has the potential to rise with additional plays.

This is my second Rondel game.  I'm still not sure of my opinion of the Rondel but for this game, it seems to work really well.  There are a lot of options for scoring points.  There are multiple paths that you can pursue.  There is some variation in regards to how the colonies come out, but I don't believe that this is too overpowering.  So far, I think you do need to pay attention to what others are doing.  I am looking forward to more playings of this one.  [03/13/2011]

Z pozoru gra jakich wiele - plansza, pionki, trochę kafli i monet. Ma jednak jedną wielką zaletę - jest wybitnie anty "przymuleniowa" - tempo gry powoduje, że żaden gracz nie musi czekać w nieskończoność na swoją kolejkę. Wielki "+" za mechanizm, jakość wykonania i wzorowo napisaną instrukcję - wyjaśnianie zasad to jakieś 10 minut. Gra raczej na 3 - 5 osób, na 2 jest trochę niemrawa i zbyt wyrównana.

it seems like every game i play someone gets out of sync and falls so far behind they are completely out of the game by half way through and spend the rest of the game just passing time.

While the game is quite enjoyable to play 5 or 6 times I just don't find myself wanting to play it very often anymore.

RATING: 1
Rating after 1 solo play. I know how it sounds, but I'm unlikely to ever play it "for real". Problem is, I've tried this after a session of Imperial which intrigued me and really stuck in my memory. And this ... well, it's nothing like it. 

[u]Comparing Navegador to Imperial[/u] - these games might not even belong in same hobby, let alone genre. The rondel system on its own is a clever way of pulling levers that pushes you in some kind of sequence. So to be good at a rondel game one needs some practice in order to get a handle on the levers. But there's a huge difference: in Navegador you're pulling levers on your own, as if you would try to find a way to optimise ladders to reach a particular space in an empty tower (okay, weird metaphor, stay with me here). Sure others will take particular  ladders and those won't be there for you, but that's the whole interaction - running for these ladders. In Imperial, you're all in the same space and everyone's in zero gravity, so what ever move you make (what ever lever you pull), you're moving everybody, the whole system. Imperial thus takes a while to learn as everyone will try to adopt and roll with these shifts. Navegador on the other hand doesn't require such skill, it's more about getting your head into the spread sheet that's so neatly drawn on the board. 
[u]Imperial is a game, Navegador is a puzzle. [/u]

In the end of the day Navegador feels to me a bit like Puerto Rico (turn order effect), a bit of Goa (scoring spread sheet) and a bit of JASE's spread sheet logic, so if I ever feel like playing something in this vain, I'll probably pick PR or PoF. And what's with the spice trading shtick? Didn't work any better in Goa... Is there a spice trading game that feels thematically immersive?

But if Gerts wants to do this sort of games all the time in the future, I don't mind, Imperial makes up for everything else he made or might made. For those people who find Imperial hard to digest (Eric Summerer, ahem), there are plenty other rondel games to choose. And if you're one of them and  like this, well, more power to you. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired AND brown. Without one of these it might still be 1.5, but...

RATING: 7
Played once with 3P. The game system behind Navegador is initially deceptive – the constant juggle between workers, money and managing the market is simply a means to the end of getting multipliers for end-game scoring. But once past that, the game is solid.

One reservation I have is that the market is too dependent on seating order. Essentially, you want to be specialising in the goods which complement what the player to your right has.

Loved it from the second half of the first play, when it began to make sense. My first rondel game, but I really like that mechanic. Like the fact there are different ways to win. Like the fact you can react to what other people are doing, but not so much as to make it openly combative. Downsides: it is long, and there is a game-winning strategy that needs to be policed by other players or someone will walk away with it.

[1 play] My rating could rise. There was a lot to learn, and this game is not kind to beginners if veteran players are snatching up all of the buildings while they are cheap. I was more interested in navigation, which is fun, but clearly an inferior strategy in the face of experience.

While I wish Mac Gerdts could show us what he can do without a Rondel Mechanism, this seems to be the best one so far. I like the theme, and I did feel like we were expanding the Portuguese empire and exploiting the economics of the times.

I look forward to trying this again, and I suspect the 2 player game could be excellent as well.

More complex and interesting than it's predecessor, Antike, Navegador features a similar rondel and an innovative market system.

Very good medium-heavy trading game. The game punishes you a lot and you always have too little ressources. Its very good and very brutal. A bit too intense for me (I would rate it lower for actual fun), but extremely well designed and it even achieves a bit of theme (not much though.)
The rondel is very tight and needs planning, other players need being watched, ressources and ship routes need be painstakingly calculated. All quite extreme.

A szerző újabb rondellás játéka, amire ugyanazt tudom írni, mint az első ilyen játékára az Antike-ra. Teljesen korrekt darab, de nem nyűgöz le. Teljesen más a téma, a játékosok felfedezők szerepébe bújnak és gyarmatokat hódítanak meg, begyűjtve az értékes arany, cukor és fűszer terményeket. A játékban a szerencse szerepe nem túl magas, az egyes gyarmatok feldezésénél jelentkezik, ki mennyi pénzt tud ekkor begyűjteni. A pontozás nagyon jól kitalált és elég kiegyenlített végeredmények tudnak lenni, ami pont az általános gondom a rondellás játékokkal. Számomra teljesen egyértelmű, hogy a 3 ingyenes lehetőségből melyik a legjobb, úgy érzem sok gondolkodást nem igényel ez a döntés, pedig ez a fő döntés tulajdonképpen. Ebben a játékban még könnyebb is ez, mert a további lépések ára szerintem ebben a játékban a legfájóbb így nagyon ritkán teszik meg a játékosok. Értékes felfedezőhajót kell adni, minden egyes plusz lépésért. Én úgy gondolom, hogy egy rondellás játék bőven elég egy gyűjteménybe, mert hiába teljesen mások a témák, én a főmechanizmus miatt nem érzek jelentős különbségeket játékélmény szempontjából ezeknél a játékoknál. Nekem még mindig az Imperial tetszik a legjobban, de szívesen kipróbálom majd a Hamburgumot is.

Another winner from Mac Gerdts. Smooth mechanics, although not as smooth as Concordia. You have to balance between exploring, building up your roster of colonies, and angling for key victory point bonuses. I've just begun to dip into this game and I already like it quite a lot. One plus over Concordia is that Navegador is much more thematic. You really have a sense of being a Portuguese merchant prince spreading across the Indian Ocean.

If this is a good indicator of rondel games, I will have to pass.  It just felt like we were taking turns doing the same thing.  It was balanced enough, almost too balanced actually, to the point where I didn't feel I was doing anything important several turns.  I actually started to get BORED near the end.  Perhaps i'm not a fan of economic games, but this one was one of the worst I've played.

RATING: 8
there has been an amazingly quick rondel-inspired tempo to every game i've played, but the strings of decisions you must deliberate are anything but fleeting.  i like the balance of developing a long term strategy after a couple of turns, with the need for tactical adjustment in response to other players.  a healthy dose of player interaction here, as you really can't be successful without constantly surveying all players' tableau. ships rythmically propelling to nagasaki, improvisational response on four other fronts, navegador feels almost musical to me... perhaps miles' classic quintet, nefertiti if pressed.

Excellent addition to the Rondel library. This game has a lot going on: from the Planet Steam type economic market to long term action planning and it all just works. Surprisingly good with five players. Would definitely like to play again.

RATING: N/A
Initial impressions, still need to explore it a little more.  I like how the rondel system keeps the game moving at a pretty steady pace, since players are typically limited to a choice of 3 actions.  I'm not sure I really like how the optimal strategy in this game is to just focus on one or two tracks and nothing else.

The game rules are a bit long to explain, but it plays quickly once you get past that. The only real problem was that the end of the game seemed never to come; it dragged on and on.

Truly disappointing and really not that interesting.  I have just found the other rondel games to be more entertaining and this one just did not appeal much to me.  The endgame seemed to drag quite a bit and I think it lasts too long.  I find Endeavor to be much better for the theme and maybe Shipyard for a rondel-style mechanic.

RATING: 3
Win or lose, I don't feel like I've earned the result. I prefer games with relatively narrow or obvious goals; "get the most VPs" doesn't qualify when there are lots of things you can do and everything you do gets you VPs. And here, because it's all end-game scoring, in order to figure out how well you're doing you have to do a lot of pointless, arbitrary math. Worse yet, optimal strategy involves interacting as little as possible with everyone else. There are some great ideas here, but that's almost worse, as they compound my complaints with disappointment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I kind of shot myself in the foot early on and spent the whole game struggling to keep up, so that sort of colors my view of this game. It's definitely not a bad game, but at this point I think I'd like to see Mac Gerdts design a game without a rondel (and no, Macchu Pichu doesn't count).

Feels a bit like Hamburgum but more refined (and, of course, with a different theme) and also with a twist on Imperial's investor cards. May be the best of his lighter rondel games, maybe as good as Imperial?

Players are Portuguese explorers exploring, colonizing, selling/refining goods, and building buildings. It's all driven by the rondel, where you can choose actions to build ships, move ships (explore; earn cash as you do so), colonize, build buildings (churches, shipyards, factories for the 3 types of goods), recruit workers (cost money; spend them to colonize; need minimum number to build various buildings), go to market (to sell/process goods, earn cash), or buy privileges (end game VP multipliers based on how well you've done all those other things). 

As with most rondel games, you want to do a bunch of things but must choose one; generally, if you can make a plan over several turns, you take incremental steps each turn and the game moves along briskly. But you always want to do more than one thing, so you end up reassessing every turn (hopefully, quickly!). 

Works very well! One possible downside that it shares with Puerto Rico -- your options depend on what the player before you does (you don't want to do the same thing!). Might that be a problem if playing with mixed-experience groups?

There's always a lot going on in this game. Disclaimer #1: this is my favourite theme of all. 2010 seemed to be the year to design games about the Portuguese discoveries with a few titles about it. 
Disclaimer #2: Navegador was also designed because of me (I say it with no bit of modesty, I admit).

I like the fact that players always have good options to take. I really enjoy that in a game because it turns out to be a positive game, sort of speaking. Even so, decisions are sometimes a bit too obvious and I keep finding the market a bit boring.
In the end the overall is that the player who did better as a whole should win the game meaning that often Navegador rewards balance above specialization - I like that too.
Played it with 2 and 3 players. Still finding the right number but I believe that 4 players should be it.
Components are a blast and that board is awesome!

I am a big Rondel games fan.  I really like the rondel.  I loved it in Imperial and Imperial 2030, but in those it can get a little repetitive.  Here, it offers lots of juicy choices and based on your strategy, you can skip some actions for almost the entire game.    In Navegador, you have ample strategies, with a similar numbers of actions on the rondel.  Each strategy has the same basic building blocks (the most important of these is cash), but from there you can pursue one of the basic strategies and ride it to victory.   Here is a brief overview.  Each player is an explorer/entrepreneur in colonial era  Portugal.   You start with workers and ships.  Workers are need to build factories, colonies, shipyards and churches.  Factories and colonies generate cash, Shipyards allow you to build ships cheaply, churches allow you to produce workers cheaply.  Each of these is also worth VP's.  On each players card, you will track your assets and a multiplier for each asset.  At the end of the game you multiply the numbers of an asset times the multiplier for VP's.  For example, if you have 6 colonies, and your colony multiplier is 4, you would have 24 VP's at end game scoring.

The market action is the key to income generation.  Colonies generate either sugar, gold or spice and are sold to the market.  the market gets driven down as goods are sold to it.  Factories (which are purchased by type), use goods and generate a profit based on the market price.   Factories are "using" the goods and hence raise the market.  the profit from factories gets better as the goods get cheaper, so it is in the players best interest to buy factories of goods that are being sold to the market frequently.  

To throw another factor in the equation, this is at its heart an exploration game.  You have ships which progress along the board exploring new areas gaining exploration tokens (which generate valuable VP's since you start with a x4 multiplier), and you get to discover native colonies.  When an area is explored, a stack of colony markers are flipped over revealing a cost.  These costs are varied and represent the cost to develop the colony.  the person who discovered gets cash based on the lowest value.   Later, an action can be taken to colonize.    So exploring gains you VP's and generally gives you first crack at developing a colony.  

So explore, build shipyards, build churches, build factories or develop colonies.  Each seems viable for winning, each seems almost necessary for moving forward.  An interesting mix of development vs, VP generation.  I have only played once but I can see this taking many, many plays before I figure out what strategy is best.  You see, since everything generated VPs, it is not like most games of this type where you go for optimal early game development and late game VP generation.  Almost every action contributes to both.  

A solid game that deserves more play.

So, my initial introduction to this game was horrible, to the point where a friend and I would joke about it.  But I was convinced by a friend to give it another try and am happy that I did.  The game is actually very good, and one that I would happily play again.  Lots of opportunities to develop different strategies for multiple paths to victory.

Excellent economic rondel game. I'm not entirely sure about the "scriptedness" -- it's more or less a requirement to set up a strategy to leech off the player(s) to your right and their impact on the markets, so the first few turns may be spent in fumbling quasi-negotiation until players are more or less set on a strategy. But I do love me a rondel.

I really want more plays.

Another rondel in an interesting game!  P.S. Here in my 7th playing of Navegador we have apparently *finally* gotten the rules right about the way the market is supposed to work.  (This after going through two fundamentally wrong concepts about it!)  And I really do hope we've got them right this time, because the game made significantly more sense this way.  P.P.S. Here at my 23rd playing of Navegador, I've decided it's about time I raised my rating on this game, because it has become a firm favorite.  I'm not quite ready to make it a 9, but that could happen in another 10 or 20 games!

Some theme play.  Game is fairly easy to play, market dynamic is a little tricky.  Does not play like the typical euro (no worker placement) and the rondel mechanic works well.

Game length is about 2 hours which seems to go quick.

After my first play of the uber-boring Hamburgum, I wasn't sure I wanted to revisit the rondel.  Boy, am I glad I did.  Navegador takes a great mechanism and builds a superb game around it.  What's particularly interesting about Navegador is that every single action is useful at almost every time.  What you end up doing is working to make sure you maximize every one of those actions.

The market in the game is pure awesome.  I love how as more stuff gets sold the price drops, but that incents people to produce the product instead of selling it, thus driving the cost back up.  It's really quite awesome and is enough to make the game great by itself.

I'll rate this one an 8 to start.  I hope I get to play this one more because it really could climb quite a bit.

Superb rondel-driven exploration game. The aim is to increase your colonies and the workers, factories, churches and shipyards within them, which both aid your development and count towards victory points. As in all rondel games you have to determine which choices to pass over and how to develop the balanced strategy needed to be successful i.e. there is no point building ships if you don't have the necessary currency and workers available to colonise. In several previous releases ('Antike', 'Imperial', 'Hamburgum' etc) designer Mac Gerdts has proven that he can combine the rondel as a driving mechanism excellently with games that provided numerous strategic challenges, and each new publication feels quite differently from the last (no simple rehashing of old ideas here). For me though, 'Navegador' is the pinnacle of his rondel series of games so far.

Ratings (1 to 5):

Simplicity: 5
--> Minimal rulebook, very easy to learn game.

Depth: 4
-->  Requires good planning and a medium level of strategy.  Many different paths to winning this game, and I haven't found any one to be too unbalancing or that can't be effectively countered.

Player Interactivity: 3
--> You need to be aware of what your opponent is doing and how you can take advantage of opportunities that he gives you, as well as things you can do to block or frustrate his plans.  However, I can understand some people's complaint that the game can become a little predictable about 2/3 of the way through, as each players' strategy and optimal individual path forward becomes clear and play becomes more solitaire.  There are still some ways to interact and affect your opponent throughout the entire game, but it generally decreases as the game progresses as you focus on maximizing victory points for your particular strategy.

Theme: 3
--> This game is supposed to simulate colonization and exploration in the 15-16th century, but the theme is not strong here.  This is a typical resource management Euro without much to reinforce the setting or feeling of the time it is supposedly emulating, so it's a bit dry.

Fast-Moving: 4
--> The rondel mechanism ensures relatively quick turns (usually, you will choose from one of three available actions).  Rarely prone to analysis paralysis.

Replayability: 4 (with the separately-purchased expansions, otherwise a 3)
--> The sameness of the starting board and the identical ship path to the Nagasaki end game is a negative, as it is a bit repetitive.  However, adding the two expansions adds some welcome variety to the game and goes a long way to prevent the game from getting stale.

Another economic game, reminds me of Endeavor superficially but with better strategies. However,  I dont find these sort of mechanics, like moving the fleets; choosing the bonus character; choosing the buildings, to be anything like reality. So the mechanics are too abstract to reflect history and they are too elaborate to create a classic abstract. The game does seem pretty well balanced, found it too long (just about 2 hours) but others will probably accept that. If you like this sort of thing it's done well, clean rules, open to different strategies etc.

Only one play so far, so need to try it some more to make a final opinion.  So far I enjoyed it - but not as much as some other games.  One complaint is that it never seems to matter if you process A and sell B, or process B and sell A - as you get pretty much the same $$ either way!

RATING: 6
As a two-player game, which is what I've tried, the game was a very enjoyable experience and a wonderful variation on the rondel mechanism. The game was a bit too zero-sum for my tastes, and some of the calculations overly time-consuming; however, despite these flaws, I still found the game a tense and exciting game of optimization and timing. I especially enjoy, now in retrospect, the choice of when to open up each new segment of the map -- which can in turn have a number of ripple effects throughout the game depending on your strategy and where your opponents are located relative to your progress. Overall, I look forward to repeat plays, especially with three and four players.

UPDATE: After another game, this time with four players, I have reduced my rating. It's not that the game failed to deliver. Rather, it's flaws were on display. Compared with the more refined (and similar) system presented in Concordia, Navegador feels too much like a mathematical optimization exercise. Perhaps as I gain familiarity with the subtitles of the system, my opinion will change again for the better. As of now, however, I'll stick to Antike for my rondel and Concordia for my rondel-like economy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is probably my favorite of the Rondel games.  There is an advantage in Navegador to do the things that the other players aren't doing, and that can set you on a different path every time you play.  The market has a supply and demand aspect, so trying to time things out can be interesting (or it can sink you if you're trying to do the same thing as your right-hand opponent).

Wow, great euro game. Lots of options each turn, but you always know what choices you have and how to accomplish them. So many things you want to do each turn and you have to pick just one.

Another fun rondel game that is very approachable. Tougher to understand than Hamburgum by a little, there is a steeper learning curve. While the game provides several paths to victory, a colony strategy won both of our games. While this a nice game that plays quickly after the first learning game, I am very worried about variability and replayability as there are few random factors (colony values being the only one) to mix things up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Navegador is the most approachable of Gerdts' rondel games.  But the problem with hanging an efficiency game on a rondel is that to specialize, you must make the same choices on the wheel every 3 turns.  This gets dreadfully repetitive.  Furthermore, the game arc occurs along a linear oceanic path and there's almost no confrontation.  Navegador is a rondel twist on the mature efficiency game genre, and the results are merely okay.

RATING: 9
I like it so far. It combines a lot of familiar euro elements in a way that really works. However, my plays so far have been very similar thanks to the static rondel and very few variable elements. Hopefully this will change as we try different strategies.

Update: Now that we know the game a little better, it doesn't feel repetitive at all. The player interaction is indirect - it comes in the form of a fluctuating market and a race across the board - but very important.

2/2/12 - This is a great game. I've only played once, but it's right up my ally and I'm certain it will only get better with more plays. I'm very excited to teach ths one to the rest of my family and see how it plays with more than two. It plays outstanding with two, by the way. 

If you like Euros, it's a no- brainer. If you don't like Euros, it's still a decent option.

12/9/12 - I used [thread=671709]Tom Lehmann's 2p set-up variant[/thread] for this tonight and I'll probably keep using it from now on. I still haven't played this game with more than two, and I really want to.

This game seems to have a lot of depth and replayability. The roundel mechanic is integrated well enough that play moves quickly (single action per turn) but choices do not feel slifled. There are probably some obvious opening choices, but it is possible to do very well along multiple strategic paths. Interaction is limited but a savvy player will be able to anticipate and intercept their opponents. I look forward to playing this one again.

Another one I really enjoyed on the first time through, I'd like to get this one to the table a couple weeks in a row just to explore it more before forgetting the rules and strats.

Played again and enjoyed it again, the rondel really helps keep the game flowing well, even with 5P the play time was really reasonable.

OK, so I am a rondel/Mac Gerts fan. This one is again very elegant and fun, with increased player interaction over Hamburgum. Just a tinge of randomness in the colony values. The stock market chart is genius, representing the creating and selling of 3 different goods with minimal physical exchange of bits required.  Several strategy paths are possible, and the game seems to stay tight.

I really liked this game. I thought I might be in for another drab and dull euro when the game hit the table, but several things made this one pretty interesting. First, I'm a fan of rondels and this one worked well. Additionally, it seems like there is a pretty good balance between different victory paths, I'd already like to try one or two of the others and see how they play. Buying privileges to determine your endgame scoring bonuses was a pretty neat mechanic. There isn't much flashy here, but it's a solid engaging game.

Played one game so far and the rondel was damn frustrating 

I love it when I can't quite get to do the actions I want

Friend said this wasn't even the best of the rondel types so I look forward to more plays of this and others

First looking at the board it seems the game will be a fairly easy one but the mechanisms are tied so well together that isn't really the case

Not complicated to learn and after a few rounds the game opens up quite a bit in your mind I think

enjoyable experience - just an initial rating that I can see going up after more plays

I couldn't wait to play this game, brought it to Unity Games XVII but didn't find the time, everybody commented on how good it is.  I finally got to try a 2 player game and it was as fantastic as everybody says. I love the board and bits, and game play really works.  I like all of Mac Gerdts' Rondel games, and he's really getting it down. They're so easy to learn to teach, because all you need to know is how each action on the Rondel is played, and through play the game begins to make sense until you reach an epiphony and you understand the game utterly.  It makes me want to get a whole bunch of people to play nothing but Hamburgum and Antike and Navegador, etc. I'm so glad to have all of MG's really great games in my collection. I taught and played in an amazing game of this at ConnCON 2011 where players made the economy work to be getting 600+ Crusados on their Market action. We all thought the richest player, who also had founded 14 colonies was going to win, but another player sneaked by who was working on 2 strategies. Great game!!

I played another great 5 player game of this at Oasis of Fun in Atlanta this year. I taught and ended up winning in a close 3-way competition. Everybody loves this game, which is now a "dime" for this year's 5 and dime list!

see: Antike, Hamburgum and expansions, Princes of Machu Picchu, Imperial, Imperial 2030.

Amazingly it didn't come out in 2012 at all. Will have to rectify that for 2013!

Feels like a lot of sliding scales, but not without narrative, which is quite rich.  The glossing over of colonialism's dark side is ignored, but it's not a simulation; it's a euro.  A very entertaining one, and at 2-5P a very attractive piece for the collection.

RATING: 6
Seems like a decent enough game. I would rate it a 7 except for the endgame, which really dragged out in our play, with everyone just making money and buying things. Granted, it would have been in someone's interest to end the game sooner by sailing to Japan, but without calculating everyone's scores it's not necessarily clear who that is.

RATING: 4
What a disappointment. I was really hoping for more in this Gerdt's design. At least the ratings had me all hyped up. The game is a navigation and exploration game, but by the time I reached Goa, I had decided to sell my ships and be a factory manager instead. The last third of the game was rote, predictable and utterly repetitive. In other words, not much fun! As a fellow gamer and friend noted, the game has a weak story arc and does not do the theme much justice.  There is engine building, but subtle. I chose to focus on factories not because I wanted to, but because I sort of fell in the trap of generating income, buying buildings and privileges, then back to getting income..etc. Any deviation from that cycle would just set me back as the rondel made sure that I would spend several rounds just to put myself back in the appropriate position. Also, the market track is clever but fiddly. Moving the cubes up and down the track and remembering which direction the cubes go is mildly annoying. The components are decent and the board is gorgeously printed, but otherwise, the game was a disappointment.

Very interesting! I like how the Rondel is very squirrely in its construction (In order to do the thing ahead of me, I'll first need to do the thing I just skipped over...damn!). I'm very intrigued by it, and very much enjoyed my play of it, but it didn't really set me on fire. I wonder if that bodes well or ill for Antike?

This game is awesome. I knew I would like this after I read a few reviews, but didn't know that I would love it as much as I do. I love the fact that there is very little luck, and the Rondel makes many decisions agonizing, as it is often extremely difficult to decide whether to skip a space in order to get back to a certain action faster, or to take an action that does not move you as far, but will help on future turns. The mechanics are well executed, as there are many different paths to victory, and a huge amount of strategy and variability, despite the low luck element. I especially enjoy the strategy of the free sailing action. I love Navegador, but never pronounce it like 'Navigator'. What fun is that?

We're big fans of Hamburgum, and this is reminiscent of it, but without being too much the same so as to not enjoy both. Move around the rondel, collecting resources, improving in the various categories. There's a little more going on here though, with the five different categories for scoring, and how they multiply on your personal board. Really nice push/pull market system with varying prices depending on how you sell, so one player may be driving a price one way to their benefit, and another player drives it the other way, both helping each other in the long run. Gorgeous map, which my wife loves.

(April 2011 - after 1 correct playing of the rules) - Had a bad experience with this one in December where we had initial set up wrong - no church, no shipyard - so money was extra tight.  Plus a guy left early.   Anyway, the 2nd time around it went much better.  It is a game where you need to zig when others are zagging and optimize your moves.  It does not hurt to pay attention to your left so you don't help them too much and to look to your right to see if they can help you.   It had me thinking of better moves the rest of the night which I enjoy in a game.

RATING: 7
Commented after one game. Reminds me of Hamburgum, which is no wonder, because the designer is the same. Overall quite an average game. With players who know the rules, this might be a much quicker game and more enjoyable. One negative thing is that while the name of the game points to sailing, it is quite easy to gather up points without sailing that much, just building factories etc.

Need to be tested on four or more players in the future, but I don't think this will be my favorite.

Updated after the second play, now with four. It took over two hours all together, but didn't feel that long. I have better feeling now than after the first play, even though the players weren't very experienced this time either. I had a rather good plan, but because I generated it during the game, it took a little bit too long to give me victory. :)

Sooo good. Rondel actions. The rondel is designed in such a way that you must forgo certain actions because the timing of actions is important. Love the resource stock manipulation where the values of what you produce and refine is dependent on what colonies you and your opponents found. Love the race to explore, which unlocks tiles to put in your own personal tech tree for end game victory points based on the things you've invested in during the game. Love that it's the end game timer as well.

Initial impressions have left me curious to try a couple different strategies but overall the game didn't intrigue me as much as Gerdt's earlier efforts Imperial and Princes of Machu Picchu. Need repeat plays to solidify my opinion. Update: Second game was really a drag, but perhaps Navegador doesn't scale well down to three. It bothers me that the game seems too procedural and lacking important decisions once you commit to a strategy (which happens relatively early). There could be more to this game than I'm giving it credit for but with so many other games I can't be bothered to find out.

A seafaring economic game that offers multiple paths every turn allowing for different approaches to success, but can lead to AP for those new to the game.  The Rondel is a novel method for selecting actions and I look forward to trying other games that implement it (like the heavier Imperial).  Scoring only happens at the end of the game, so it isn't easily apparent how one is faring during the game, but final scores have been very close each time.

Another great game by Gertds.
Rules aren't short but they are fairly simple after a few turns.
There really are different paths to victory.
But the best aspect is the feeling you get during the game: the flow of the game is so good, it is a game that doesnt play very shortly but time flies so nicely. You always have some2 or 3 good actions you would like to do, timing is essential.
The Only aspect that prevents (so far) a rating of 9 is that it seems the first action "sailing" is quite forced. Is it really like that? dunno, but i want to play it again to discover it.

Trading in the Mediterranean and beyond, but with a rondel, and fun. I really like this game and its various balancing mechanics. I've heard complaints about it's long term playability, but I haven't hit that yet.

I've traded this one away after three plays because the more I played it, the more I felt that the game almost played itself. You'd need to specialize in one of the privileges and then hunt down what earns you points. I did really enjoy the rondel and how your choices were limited, thus speeding up the game play, but I don't need to own it.

RATING: 4
Another game where the best strategy is to do what no one else is doing, then gather the prestige (bonus scoring) tokens corresponding to this least-traveled path to cement your victory.  And yes, it IS more complicated than that - but not by much.

Note to the general public and/or my wife: Please wake me when this style of game retires to the annals of history.

Frankly, I despise what I see as a severe flaw in economic engine games (London, Navegador, etc.): A given player's viability is highly correlated with the endgame trigger and whether that player is able to perform the last 1-2 actions that might result in a win.  If two actions would win a player the game, but the player is only able to enact one final action, then the actual winner's victory is weak at best and undeserved at worst.  

Whether players get an equal number of turns is also at issue, of course, but there's no guarantee of that here.

Longer than we had expected the game would be.  I love that you can gain victory points for everything you do; however, I find that the game will come to a point where people are stalling progress of game end to get as many random points as possible.  This seems unnatural in the game progression and I find that buying churches & shipports matter more for victory points than the use in the game.

Overall...a well designed but somewhat boring game theme.

RATING: 8.5
Off of two plays... I'm still amazed at how enamored I am with this game. The use of the rondel mechanic works in such an elegant way, and how the beginning of the game feels like a slow build to an eventual race.

While there was some concern after the first play that the game could feel "samey" over time, I don't think that really would be the case as the game setup has enough variables to negate that. The initial tile placement for one game could create the conditions for an all out sprint or a longer grind. Does someone's calculated risk of jumping up the rondel block where you wanted to go? Did your opponent manipulate the market in such a way that you will no longer be able to afford the upgrades that you desperately needed? Or, did you someone use the navegador card before you to swoop in a settle the lands that you were hoping to on your turn?

For a game that is fairly simple rule-wise, there's so many things going on and so many things to take in to account. You really need to take in to account what your opponents are doing on many fronts. Not only because they could block you, but also because you want to position yourself to be able to take advantage on the market when they manipulated. This ebb and flow really adds a great dynamic to the game.

Again... I don't know what it is specifically about this game that I enjoy so much, but it was something that I knew I wanted to have after the first game I played.

This is a decent economic game. The best part is likely the way the market works. As with other rondel games turns should be quick so it gets around to you pretty quickly.

6 after 1 play

Main game mechanic utilising the rondel feels very multiple solitaire and player interaction is very low and indirect. It encourages specialisation, after which competition is likely to become low. The market action part can be quite fiddly. The actions feel a little repetitive after a while and the game suffers from a lack of a stronger story arc. The loss of 2 ships for the first player to reach Nagasaki seems pretty heavy.

Artwork is fine and game component is good. The ship meeples are probably the best of the components.

I put off getting into Mac Gerdts 'rondel' games for years and I wish I hadn't!...little to no randomness, everything is there in front of you to strategize for points, lightning fast player turns, a winner with my group...

Feels like Hamburgum, but works much better and theres more to do and think.

EDIT: I like the game, but it feels too balanced with 4. Next game I want with 3 or 5.

Un buen juego con rondel, donde podemos vender o procesar las mercancías que vayamos descubriendo y fabricando a lo largo del ancho mundo. Tal vez lo peor del juego es su final, que puede eternizarse si ningún jugador quiere descubrir la última loseta. Perfecto a cuatro jugadores.

Simple mechanics, tons of depth. A lot of different avenues to explore in this game. Focus on exploring? Perhaps settling colonies would work best in this play? Need to study this one more!

Another rondel game by the designer of Hamburgum and Imperial.

The rondels just don't quite do it for me.  There's some decent game here but I'm never going to fall into like with it just because of that mechanic.  

Better than Imperial; worse than Hamburgum and Shipyard.

I describe this game as "feeling like Puerto Rico" because of the right hand opponent nature of the design.  (Whatever the person to your right does, you want to do the opposite.)  A very good game that should get more love than it does.

Egy másik kedvenc. :meeple: Ez egy felfedezős stratégiai játék. Ami nagyon kiemelkedő ebben a játékban, hogy nagyon jól súlyozott. 

Több taktikai megoldással lehet nyerni (sok felfedezés, gyarmatosítás, gyárépítés). :ninja: Ez egy olyan játék, ahol mindenre szükség van (pénz, munkás, gyarmatok, kiváltságok, épületek...), ezért azt se tudja az ember mit lenne jó csinálni, ami folyamatos feszültséget teremt az emberben. 

Ketten is izgalmas. Mindenkinek ajánlom, aki szereti az összetett stratégiát. :cool:

One of the rare games that rewards specialization. The only reason why I didn't rate it perfect 10 is the fact that shipyard / church privileges are absolutely necessary. Also some sound complains by others that it is always the same (going to the East) but that is correct only for sailing aspect. Also - market tends to lock at highs or lows after several rounds.
Beautiful art, wonderful feeling, rondel is my favorite mechanic and it feels different enough from Imperial and other uses. Maybe it is even a quintessential euro for my taste - fast with rondel, stimulates specialization, has a small functioning market, beautiful board... Maybe some special powers would be interesting, but it would ruin elegance we love in Gerdts' designs.
Sadly under-appreciated in my group.

After 2+ Plays: Probably my favorite of the rondel games, but that isn't saying much as I've yet to be overly impressed with any of them.  It all works together just fine and there seem to be a couple viable strategies, but after only a few games I already feel myself slipping into autopilot while I play.

Zagrałem. Pierwsza moja gra gdzie w mechanizmie użyty jest " rondel". Gra rozczarowała mnie. Liczyłem na ciekawą marynistyczną opowieść. Wyszła z tego morska "Agrikola" gdzie przeważył aspekt ekonomiczny. 
Są jednak tacy którym ta gra się podoba. Więc sam wyrób sobie zdanie na temat tej gry.

Excellent euro game.  Low interaction but you can really screw other people over.  I really like rondels cause it's easy to plan out your next few turns and the game flows along.

One rondel game too may for me. I think Hamburgum is better - whilst this is actually a good clever game ,there is too much going on. And I felt like you were never really on top of what you wanted to do. And in my game the one person who appeared to get a good strategy going - came third. Maybe too clever and good for me..?

After a few plays felt like it didn't have much more to offer; the coarseness of the design/decision-space feels off-putting.

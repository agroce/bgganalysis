This game has a lot of hype and is pretty expensive. In terms of value per money it may not be worth it to a lot of people. For me, it is getting decent table time and it is fun having different characters with totally different styles to play with.

What an interesting take on fighting battles! (I suppose that it helps that the designer is behind the design of video-based fighting games as well.)

It's fast, fun, and offers a variety of options and strategies that make for some interesting depth. It certainly doesn't appear to "play the same way twice." 

"Getting into the head" of one's opponent is what this is all about. We're REALLY enjoying this one. ;)

Awesome. I love this game. My wife really enjoys this game. It truly is street fighter as a card game. The only single downside of this is the art. She still is a bit turned off by the anime style artwork. I've introduced it to non-gaming friends who I'm sure would have loved it if they didn't think it looked like they were playing Yu-gi-oh (sp?).

the more I play, the more I'd like to continue playing. This is a fantastic game, and online palying make it really near perfection. It's a card game, quite simple but it's not so easy to master it. And doing a super power move that make you win when you have few LP left (like Graive's "True power of storms") maybe after a dodge is priceless!! Try to see your oppnent's mind, maximize your opportunities, think about what happened before, play a card and wait the result...suspance...

RATING: 2
It's finally happened: somebody packaged up rock, paper, scissors, and sold it.  I can't believe anybody would actually buy it, let alone pay $100 for it, but the old proverb was right: a fool and his money are soon parted.

Wow, really?  Seriously!  Are Eurogames so devoid of fun that it's come to this?  Are you Euroboys really THAT desperate?  If you guys give me $100, I'll introduce you to a really fun game: you draw a pattern on the ground and place numbers on squares.  You throw a cube and when it lands in a square, you hop to get it.  If you have adjacent squares, you spread your feet out.  How elegant is that?  Sure, it's hopscotch, but I think we can add cards, cubes, and beige to it and fool the Euroboys into thinking it's something "elegant."

And please don't tell me this isn't a Eurogame because it shares the most important common denominator: it sucks really badly and pretends to have a theme.  It's not street fighter.  It's a bad round of poker tossed in with Rock, Paper, Scissors.

[thread=799471]A Meta-Review[/thread].

Despite writing the review above, I've seen nothing but puerile bullying from Sirlin and his cronies. 

His online persona and followers represent the worst of the gaming community and are exactly why I find the industry repellent. 

---------------------------------------------------------
The dynamic - an ideal Heads-Up Poker - is a context I enjoy supremely. Ultimately, I think the 2-player gaming experience is my pinnacle; my years spent playing tournament Magic and Vs. System, along with a few more miniature wargaming, were all about this feeling. I love many multiplayer games, however, on my desert island we play tete-a-tete. 

As a corollary to the perfect information of Chess, Yomi epitomises the different mechanistic functions cards provide in gameplay. The psychological warfare is still a theme, as is the mastery of 'valuation', but this game is more about probabilities and tendencies, rather than Chess which veers towards calculable absolutes. Yomi is more exciting, as

I think ultimately I prefer 1st Edition. I don't mind 2nd edition because my main character, Midori, has a much improved character ability, but also because of Quince, whom I adore in flavour and obtuse gameplay. I also think Jaina was silly in 1st edition, though 2nd edition Jaina is almost unplayable. The advent of drawing from normals really makes Throwing a losing proposition and many of the 2nd edition characters, namely Zane and Troq, but also Gloria, BBB and Perspephone, seem underdeveloped. I think if I could run with a lineup of the version 1 lineup, with Quince in for Lum (a gambler who always wins?) I'd be happy. 

Comparisons with BattleCON: look, I don't think it's even close. The substantive issue is this: BattleCON may have more 'Yomi' between expert players - as there is no luck of the draw - but in Yomi every 'beat' is exciting because somebody wins. There are no halfhearted moments. Further to this, regardless of what character you play, each only riffs on the central mechanics, rather than changing the game entirely. I appreciate BattleCON is a well-designed game for what its purpose, however, I think Yomi is a spark of genius, providing a meaningful take on scissors-paper-rock, in-line with earth-shattering games like Starcraft. 

This brings me to my bugbear with the game - David Sirlin, and the nebbishes that follow him. Look, I think his time has passed, and he has damaged his own image so much that really only his ardent cronies at fantasystrike.com (who spam the ratings and reviews here, beware!) support him anymore. However, this bothers me, as I think his games are the best-in-class of a very specific niche and he has a lot of valid points to make about copyright, among other issues (his ripoff of En Garde is perfectly fine - Board Games are about as derivative an art form as you can find). Unfortunately, his grandiose self-possession only masks the hypocrisy that his games really aren't as 'balanced' as he claims - at least, only as balanced until the next 'patch'. If only he was as aggressive a supporter of free speech for others as he is of other self-interested legal pursuoits, I could respect him, but I'll just have to satisfy myself with his extraordinary game - can you divorce the art from the artist?

I really love Yomi a great deal. The player I spent the most time playing this game against was convinced that the game might as well be played by a random number generator. I know a fair number of people think this, and I could not disagree more. Yomi has a progression of play very similar to playing Poker with friends. At the beginning it is brutal as no one knows how anyone plays, and the game can seem too random unless you are truly amazing at reading people. Eventually though everyone knows everyone's tells and what they tend to do in a given situation, and the game becomes about getting away from those behaviors. With Yomi this is where the game shines. Play does seem random when you first start, but as you get better, and hopefully play with friends, the head games start happening, and this is where Yomi really begins.

Bought the deluxe version of this game and boy am I glad I did! Some people diss this game as nothing more but Paper-Scissor-Rock but there is definitely more to it than that. 

Firstly, the various characters really play different and lean towards certain play styles. 

Secondly, you know the game is dependent on more than just pure luck alone when the ability to read an opponent's action gives you an advantage than just blindly guessing your opponent's next move.

Lastly, this game is just a blast to play. And the huge amount of potential match ups with so many characters is great in terms of replay value. 

Get your expectations right before buying this game, and you may be in for a surprise.

I'd been following Yomi for a few months prior to its release, and seeing it close those final months was truly enjoyable.  I happily pre-ordered as soon as I could find the funds, and I am so very happy I did.

Yomi is a brilliant 2-player game.  It's easy to learn, hard to master, and above all - super-fun to play. I can't recommend it enough.

Bought the Print and Play version.  Have played it numerous times now and it really is quite fun.  Easy to learn and quick to play, it does have a lot of strategy even though the basic combat is a simple variation of Rock, Paper and Scissors.

Considering that I was never much of a fan of Street Fighter and the like, I'm surprised by how much fun I'm having with the game.

RATING: 8
When I first read about it and the reviews, they commented on how it was just "Rock, Paper, Scissors", which most fighting games boil down to.  What I didn't realize was the intricacies related to it until I read David Sirlin's blog discussing the unbalanced bonuses (http://www.sirlin.net/articles/rock-paper-scissors-in-strategy-games.html).

After playing the game online, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of it.  It has essentially distilled 2P fighting games for consoles and removed all of the dexterity out of it. So now, it's not a matter of who can perform the right move, but now just about who can guess the right move and execute properly.

Props to Sirlin.

Liked the art, loved the variability.  Found the rules mostly straightforward, although it took a bit to get used to card-flipping and stuff like special text and knockdown icons.  As an activity, I really enjoyed it.  As a competitive game, I'm not sold that the skill difference between expert and novice still wouldn't be mostly deck and game knowledge rather than mind-reading skill.  I'd still like to play it some more.

This is a really good game, but isn't quite a tabletop fighting game. It's more like advanced rock-paper-scissors, which isn't bad! It's still a fantastically designed game and a joy to play.

This game is possibly my favorite game. The depth of strategy involved is intense. Knowing your characters strengths, your opponent's character strengths, and you opponent's tendencies make this game the deepest strategy game I have ever played. It may be rock, paper, scissors at it's core, but it has depths that haven't even been explored yet. Plus, did I mention that you can play a single game in less than 30 mins. Awesome!

Kártyagyár
A játék elsőre csalódás, de mindenképp szeretnék még játszani vele, mielőtt végleg pálcát törnék felette. Egyszerűen nem akarom elhinni, hogy csak annyi tud a játék, amennyit az első parti során nekünk mutatott. A játékszabály elején szerepel a játék lényege: az egyes kártyafajták "kő-papír-olló" elven tudják egymást legyőzni. A baj csak az, hogy ez a mechanizmus az egész játékra rányomja a bélyegét. Hiába vannak a különböző (nagyon ötletes) tulajdonságok, mindenféle kombók, hiába nagyon profi az ikonrendszer, a játékban egyikünk sem érezte egy pillanatra sem, hogy tudatosan befolyásolni tudjuk a kimenetelt. Mivel nem tudom elhinni, hogy ennyire kidolgozzanak egy játékot, amiben csak a vakszerencse dönt, ezért mindenképp adok neki még esélyt, de így elsőre még ez az 5 pontot is amolyan megelőlegezés képen kapta a játék. A Print'n'Play változat van meg egyébként, nagyon igényes kivitelben, szuper házilag készült dobozban.
A játék lényegét még nem mondtam: van 10 pakli kártya, mindegyik egy karakter mozgásait tartalmazza (56 kártya paklinként). Választ mindkét játékos egy karaktert, azzal lesz a játék során és titokban kijátszott kártyákkal, meg azokra épülő kombókkal kell egymás életpontjait 0-ra ütni. Sok szöveg van a kártyákon, de csak látszólag nyelvfüggő a játék, mert csak a karakterünk 4 speciális képességet kell fejben tartani...
Eurogémerek kerüljék a játékot!

I own two physical decks, but I haven't actually used them. I have only played the free online version at fantasystrike.com.

Liked the theme and the art (rating=7).  Mostly like the chrome.  The chrome is definitely required to keep the game fresh and interesting.  Otherwise this would truly only be a rock-paper-scissors game.  

Not sure if it's enough though.  Might be nice to play once or twice a year.  Seems like it would get stale playing with the same people too many times.  Sort of reminds me of LotR: The Confrontation in that respect.

I've always enjoyed competitive best of "X" rock paper scissors. (X>7). Many people believe it to be 100% luck but I have always argued against these claims and proven it with unlikely win records against such non believers.

And then came Yomi.

Yomi perfects the rock paper scissors mechanic. Usually perfect is a dangerous word to use when describing board games due to the volume and quantity of games being produced these days. That being said, I have no difficulty claiming Yomi is perfect for what it is. That is not to say everyone will like it because this game is defiantly not for everyone and I completely understand. However Yomi is for me. I love the game from the tension it provides, to the "Princess Bride" style educated guesswork it requires, to the pool of sweat it leaves you swimming in after an exceptionally close match.

Great stuff.

I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.

A fighting game of glorified Rock/Paper/Scissors. Knowing the decks helps, but a big chunk of the game is deciding what to play (R,P,S - sorry I mean Attack, Throw, Block/Dodge) and then if you get it right how much of your hand do you throw to boost the damage.

It's okay, nothing leapt out at me as 'must have' - for a card driven dueling game I'd much rather play En garde or clash of the lightsabres.

My biggest disappointment with this one is I'm pretty sure you need to find someone else to play this repeatedly to find significant enjoyment out of it.  Play it once, and you'll dismiss it.  Play it four times in a row, and you'll really enjoy it.

1 play -- a good game but probably not my cup of tea.  I like more strategic thinking than just trying to out-think my opponent.  Not saying there isn't a good game or that there isn't a steep learning curve for learning the relative strengths of the different fighters.

This really is Street Fighter II in card game form. This is so perfect for me, as the two things I have trouble with with fighting games are execution of moves and split-second decision making. Jettisoning those gives Yomi a great deal more accessibility and makes it much less frustrating and much more fun. The mind games, the out-guessing, the combos are still there; only the bar to competitive play has been taken away.

A game that managed to capture the fast-paced, chaotic feel of video game fighting. No small feat!!

If you read the "bottom" comments for this game's rating, you'll see comparisons to rock-paper-scissors: this is accurate. There are a few nuances that make the game a bit more complex, but it doesn't change that Yomi is a very basic, simple (and fun) game.

The game feels too complicated for me. If I play this, then I can play this, and if I play these then this happens... Just too much for me. In theory all of these options are going to lead to depth, but for me it just leads to a feeling of a random game.

At the same time, the game is RPS. And to be fair, I've never enjoyed any RPS games, so it's no surprise I didn't enjoy this one either.

Secondly, the art. I'm not a fan of it, and too many of my friends would be put off by it (it's the female crotch shots).

Love the look and theme of this game... just didn't find it fun at all. And I hate the included rule page. I found it very confusing and had to download files from BGG and watch various videos just to understand how to play. Maybe the full set comes with better rules, but the rules that came with my Valerie/Geiger deck were severely lacking.

I don't mind the rock-paper-scissors concept as many seem to. People say the X-Files CCG was basically Clue. Well, I found the X-Files a lot more fun than Clue. Regardless of whether it is rock-paper-scissors, Yomi is just not fun.

Rated 7 after one play. I loved Street Fighter in college... played it a ton. And I'll be darned, this card game of rock/paper/scissors does a shockingly good job of capturing that same feel. There's much more information at your disposal when choosing which card to play, so it's certainly not a blind guessing game, that's for sure.

I have only two decks that I got in a trade, as I merely wanted to see what the game was all about. With 10 decks at one's disposal, I can guess that a lot of the magic is uncovering how unique each deck plays. For me, the dilemma is finding an opponent. Right now, there's no way I'd drop $100 on the full set, or even really try to trade for it. If my wife were to play this game, that would change the story, but I don't see that happening.

Update: traded these two decks away... I simply couldn't find another person willing to try it. Plus, with Netrunner, Summoner Wars and the slew of other two player card games, it's hard to convince my gaming buddies to try this one out.

OK, people give me a lot of shit for this rating, so I'm going to elaborate. Yomi is a fine game. High quality, great art, mechanically sound, lots of strategy and depth. For some reason I can't explain though, I REALLY can't stand playing it. Thus, I rated it a 3 "would take a lot of convincing to play this" not a 3 "this game is just bad."

I broke down and bought the PnP version. I've printed up all of the decks and had a few games. 

It's an ingenious piece of game design to put together an asynchronous game this well belanced.

Game comes with a lot of different decks.  Characters play very differently (to a new player, some seem much better/easier to win with than others).

However, I'm not sure if there's enough here to hook me.

Juegazo! Algo caro para lo que lleva. Es recomendable probar primero la versión online free para saber qué estás comprando. Mejora mucho si se juega siempre con la misma gente (leer: mezclar novatos con veteranos da una mala experiencia de juego). Pero si juntas dos veteranos, puede ser muy épico.
EDIT: Pasa el tiempo, y augmenta mi conocimiento sobre los juegos de mesa. Y ahora puedo añadir que el juego no es tan bueno como me pareció en su momento (la reseña anterior tiene 3 años aprox). Siempre ha sido un "piedra-papel-tijeras" muy vitaminado, y me gustaba que fuera así. Pero te das cuenta, de que a veces, aunque sepas que tu rival lo que quiere es sacar tijeras, puede que NO tenga la carta de tijeras, cosas que le quita la gracia al juego de adivinar lo que hará tu rival. Hace que el azar EXISTA. Y este juego me lo compré por su componente estratégico, cuando realmente prima más la táctica (saber responder a tu rival con los pocos recursos que tienes en mano). Una pena, seguramente ya no vea más mesa. Fue el juego más caro que tengo, y cada vez que lo veo en la estanteria, me acuerdo de cuando compraba por arrebatos y no pensando seriamente en lo que me ofrecia el juego. Cómo pasa el tiempo...

A few things set this apart from RPS - the different attacks have different strengths, so you can give a weight to how confident you are with your read, and the characters have differing strengths that push them towards certain moves.

RATING: 4
Components: The important information is crammed into a tiny header area on each card. I don't know why I'd want my cards to double as regular playing cards; the standard suit symbols and ranks just distract and confuse. Nice art, but I would have preferred different art on each rank of card at least.

Experience: I don't get it. I'll play again with the revised rules, but so far it seems entirely random. Other than my opponent being more likely to attack if I'm knocked down, there is no information to go on when deciding which card to play. It's pure chance whether I land a blow or block an attack. Without the hype, I wouldn't be giving this game a second look.

It's a game that you have to play lots to start to like it. Too many better games to invest the time. The money is small compared to the time this costs! Plus, after listening to the whining of the designer and buying direct for about $40 more than discount retailers, he ditches us on the next go-round with a few promo cards that he gives away to the johnny-come-latelys! I should cut the rating another point for that.

Excellent game, a cut above many fillers as there actually is skill at work. Shades of Shazamm! If you don't like second guessing your opponent, you will not like this game, however there is a lot more at work here than just plain RPS. You can definitely overthink it, but there is lots of game to progress through, learning the decks, various odds and tactics,  and most importantly in the end -your opponent-.   The game is best when you play multiple times against the same opponent and both of you are improving your own skills and trying to improve your own model/understanding of your opponent's mind.

Very well done indeed.

I love how well it emulates a fighting game (like Street Fighter) -- each character has their own unique special moves, you can combo attacks together, blocks beat attacks but throws beat blocks, etc. -- but really it comes down to "try and guess what your opponent is going to do and do the thing that beats it."  But isn't that kind of what fighting games are anyway? Sheila hates it because there are maybe a few too many rules to remember.

This game's system is very simple and ,admittedly, looks quite dull at the first glance ( rock-paper-scissors ).

Different decks feel quite differently and it adds a bunch variety to the game.

Models a Street Fighter-style fighting game match between two players based around rock-paper-scissors combat.  Fairly simple rules to learn, extremely well balanced between all ten characters, but very deep strategy.

Yomi is my favorite game of the week (easily beats Luna) and made end up being my game of the month. It has a strong chance of hitting a 9 for me, and will unlikely go below an 8. It could go down, but that would require me to grow tired of the central mechanical conceit of the game, which is unlikely. 

Essentially the game is the card game equivalent of those two-player fighting games of yore. As you guessed, I was never a huge fan of them, but I have enjoyed plenty of games of Super Smash Brothers in my day, so I have enough of an idea of what they are all about to have some appreciation for the theme. 

Mechanically the game is essentially a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors, with dodges and blocks beating attacks, attacks beating throws, and throws beating dodges and blocks. Hand management and using your specific abilities is an important aspect of the game, but an even bigger aspect is figuring out what your opponent is going to do and playing the right move to counter that. The biggest parallel (for me) is probably figuring out the action selection in Race For the Galaxy, with the effect being direct rather than based on leeching.

So yeah, based on my four (1-3) in-person plays and a reasonably large number against the (bad) AI I like this game quite a bit at the moment. Further play will depend on how much the other locals like it and whether I am able to actively improve my skill at the game. I think signs are pretty positive in both directions. So this one gets a definite thumbs up for me right now.

RATING: 9
Two player card game where each player plays a character deck, fighting their opponent's deck.  Fast and furious game where players select a card from their hand, reveal simultaneously and resolve to see who got a hit in.  Cards are Attack, which beats Throw, which beats Dodge/Block, which beats Attack.  So we have a simple rock, paper, scissors mechanic, with several layers of second guessing subtlety added in.  Hits can lead into chained combinations, cards can have extra abilities, as well as attack speeds for resolving ties.  Brilliant art, quick fire game play (once you get past the initial confusion), and some really clever stuff. The more you play, the deeper it gets, and in fact feels almost Blue Moon-esque when the mind games kick in.  The production version with all 10 decks in the box is stunning - the cards appear to be thin, but in fact are a joy to play with - shuffling and handling very nicely.  The player mats are excellent, providing just the right amount of play area to keep everything sorted.  The more I play it, the more besotted I'm becoming with it.

RATING: 7
This is based on the print-and-play edition.
 The game is (yet another) simulation of a fighting game. I say yet here since it fits neatly in Sirlin Games' catalog of fighting games (the other two being the excellent Puzzle Strike and Flash Duel, which I haven't tried yet). The basis of this game however center more on being able to read your opponent and trying to play the perfect move than coming up with the best combination of cards/chips, which is Puzzle Strike's dominion. At it's core, Yomi is a simple game of rock-paper-scissors (RPS), with the cards having two "ends" showing two of the following three actions: attack; throw; dodge or block. Just like RPS. Attack will beat Throw, which beats Dodge/Block etc. Attacks do different levels of damage as do throws and have different speeds, in case of ties. Since this is based on a regular deck of cards, the face cards and aces are special, more powerful attacks or throws. So, you play a card, with the action you wish to do facing your opponent and both reveal at the same time, look at the cards and see what happens. Very simple. If you land an attack, you can "chain" another attack by simply playing a card that is one rank higher, an "ender" or "link" (special keywords that are on face cards). What makes the game really interesting is the additional powers some cards have as well as some of the face cards, especially the ace. Fun and fast, but... the rule sheet is actually pretty horrible, making it hard to follow just by reading them and the text on the cards is tiny. Once you start playing however, everything becomes clear, mostly because all of the rules are actually on the cards themselves, such as what to do when you successfully block an attack (you take the block back in your hand and drawn another card), how to chain, etc. Once you become familiar with the game and your deck, it's great fun with trying to bluff/out-think your opponent.
Well worth the $15 for the pnp.

Once you understand the game, it has nothing to do with guessing games, and everything to do with hand management and deck memorization (yours and your opponents).  Then you have to use your knowledge of the decks to calculate game-theory-style payout tables to help you choose your card.

Unfortunately memorizing decks is really tedious, and it takes away a lot of the fun of the game.  But it's necessary to get really good at the game and compete at the top levels.  I'd rather play something else than do this.

However, the middle part of the game's lifecycle -- after you figure out that it's not RPS, but before you reach the need to memorize decks and count cards -- is super fun and really enjoyable.

-----

Utterly fantastic.  See [thread=607696]my review[/thread] for more details.

One caveat: it's difficult or impossible to get a sense of the strategy from just one play.  For your first session, I recommend playing three consecutive games without you or your opponent switching characters.  This will take 45-60 minutes, so it's less than most games will take to play once.

Then, time permitting, you should swap characters with your opponent and play another three game set.  After that, you'll know what's going on enough to keep it from being random play.  Then the real fun begins!

This is basically 'Street Fighter: The Card Game' that revolves around a refined and expanded rock-paper-scissors mechanism.  In fact, the designer has worked on various Street Fighter video games (with regards to balancing them) and pitched this to Capcom as a Street Fighter card game.  Capcom didn't give the rights away so the designer made the game using his own created characters (which is also used for the designers other games, like Puzzle Strike).  The good is that each character has it's own fighting deck which plays completely different than the other characters.  It's also very easy to play, in that you and your opponent basically just simultaneously pick one card from your hand and the reveal and resolve.  Eventually over a number of rounds of combat, one player will do enough damage to beat his opponent and win.  To get all of the character decks in one package is quite expensive.  The game does have an ingenious system and it's really going to be a hit for some players.  Unfortunately, it didn't really mesh with my tastes in gaming.

Outguessing is one of my favorite things to do in games, and this game allows a lot of that. News of possible updates to the game, however, make me wonder why the game was not made "right/balanced/whatever" in the first place before being published.

The game design is perfect. The emulation of Street Fighter as a card game couldn't be any more well done. So why only a 6.5? Because, at its core, it's Rock Paper Scissors (the game makes no illusion otherwise), and that's just not a mechanism I'm into.

A fun "street fighter" themed game with an emphasis on hand management and bluffing. Each character has their own deck made up of standard "poker" playing cards, except special abilities have been added to all of them. The combo system here is pretty cool and is one of the highlights of the design for me.

Pros
-Fun to try to build combos
-Lots of characters
-Same characters as in Puzzle Strike and Flash Duel

Cons
-At the end of the day combat is random because I will never know what my opponent has played (it's a rock paper scissors mechanic)
-Characters play differently, but not sufficiently so in my opinion

RATING: 7
It's repeated scissors-paper-stone with special powers and restrictions on what you can play when. I do like how the fighting-game mechanics integrate with the gameplay, and how the characters have special moves and dumb fighting game backstories. The guessing is true to the source but I dislike how reliant the game is on it.

The art is pretty but "wannabe anime". "Midori" (a girl's name) is given to a bearded old guy (yuck); "Lum" properly belongs to a certain tiger-skin bikini-wearing alien (from Urusei Yatsura) but here is a male panda. *sigh*

It's quite a bit of fun against the AI.

This game is incredible.  It's miles deep.  And it feels *just* like a fighting game should.  A deluxe package and a worthy addition to anyone's collection.

If you've been told it's glorified RPS, well, you're wrong.  RPS is at the heart, but the valuations, tempo, rewards, and all-around play is so different than pure RPS, you forget that this is part of the engine.  You start to see it more like, "Well, if he just stands there and blocks, I'm going to throw his ass."

Just like a fighting game.

I have tried to read the enclosed rules for this game a few times now, they are either woeful or I'm beginning to get dementia (probably both). The online living rules look a bit better, but I would rather at this time learn something with simple clear rules that still had depth rather that second guess a hastily cobbled together set of rules for a game of rock paper sissors (ie all is forgiven Mr RK).

RATING: 6
Yomi really does re-create the feeling of a Street Fighter-style of fighting game in card format.  Each character has been meticulously balanced to ensure parity but asymmetrical enough to feel unique. Quite an achievement! I know the designer comes from a video game background in this field and you can really feel it here. I agree that this game isn't simply blind luck. Knowing the characters and a good understanding of the game leaves you open to ability to read (or "yomi" your opponent's next move.  The meta-game here can be fun and it is very satisfying to predict your opponent's next move and be right about it.  A '6' rating is a bit low, but does reflect my personal enjoyment of the game. As much as I like the idea of having to intuit your opponent's next move, I find that's the game's core principle and the system is built around that. When it comes to asymmetrical card fighting games, I much prefer those that have a little less of "guess what your opponent will do next" but still retains deep asymmetrical game-play and interesting mechanics.  I'd take Summoner Wars, Blue Moon or even Hera & Zeus over Yomi, but none of those games do what Yomi does.  For those who crave the Wesley/Vizzini mind battle, Yoni does it quite well.

Nice implementation of a Street Fighter-Rock/Paper/Scissors 2 player battle game. A player outguesses their opponent, then hammers them with card/move combos, while conserving cards for future turns. It's fun if given a chance. But the rule book is poorly laid out, with very small print that is hard to read, and is not organized in an easy to understand manner. Also, I'm not a fan of anime, but for those that are, the card art is nicely illustrated.

Wonderfully thematic with enamouring illustrations and graphic design. Highly addictive! On the other hand I'm still not sure how much skill is involved and how much it's about sheer luck. But even if it was mostly about luck, I think I would still like to play it because of the thematic and mechanical originality.
--------------------------
It's just so damn cool...
It's unlike any other game I've played, a breath of fresh air in many ways.

I don't think luck is a hugely dominant factor in this game. Flawless victories happened to me a couple of times. Also I play Yomi like a video game in a best out of five match.

Played on iPad. Beautiful art and poker style type of cards are actually very useful, because you always know your deck structure and card count (do not have to learn that standard card deck again) and most people are familiar with these poker style combos as well. In general this is like one to one battle game like many others, but this has outguessing (rock-paper-scissors type) and combos. But it is not so trivial as rock-paper-scissors, because of special abilities, life points, possible combos, knock downs etc. Once you get into, this is a simple game, but you do not want always just win, you want to make successful combo as well and get advantage of your special ability. The same applies to losses - usual loss is not a big deal against loss with much damage from combos, special powers etc. So, there is much more game than rock-paper-scissors. Also theme is cool. Very fast outguessing fighting game - very good!

Largely replaced by BattleCON. Not sure if I'll ever go back and play seriously. And just once I'd like to play a Sirlin game that's simpler than it looks, rather than one which looks deceptively simple and then has just enough spiky little details to make teaching it awkward.

Also, the art of the female characters is distorted in insulting ways.

RATING: 9.5
It is nothing less than astounding how adding individual character skills to the (allegedly) 2000 year old game of rock-paper-scissors and transporting it to a poker deck can turn a groaner into a masterpiece.

The many tactical options arising from a given hand give rise to onion layers of trying to read the opponent's next move based on how the past few moves played out. The game leads to onion layers of understanding and skill. What seems utterly random at first leads to ever finer levels of understanding of the characters' different bouquets of skills, then of how those skills interact, then of how they are to be employed in order to blend the tactical aspects determined by the hand into a strategy of how to maximize the characters' effectiveness, then of how to rebuild lousy hands into good ones and so on...

Utterly amazing game design.

Definitely the best elaborated rock-paper-scissors game I've played. The decision to use a standard poker deck was pure genius, as it lowers the barrier to entry significantly. The characters seem balanced and genuinely different to play and fun to explore.
All that said, I sometimes really like elaborated RPS--and sometimes it just seems like a random crapshoot. It depends on my mood (and how well I'm doing).

This game is much more than r/p/s because there us much more to think about than the three (really four in this game) basic actions. I.e. attack speed, special abilities of characters, what you can do after you attack (draw more cards, combo, attack again, stop combos with joker out bluff of joker).  

I love trying to manipulate situations to use a characters special abilities. Very satisfying when you pull it off. 

The theme that comes through is very good.

This game is very tense in general.  You can very much feel shifts in momentum do to being cocky or one bad pay.

One bad thing is that it doesn't look that fun to play.  Hard to rope people in.  I've heard done criticisms about all of the information on the cards, but after half a play all the symbols and numbers become very obvious and I actually really like the lay out.

Such wonderful components, such great art, such awesome gameplay (both in person and online) and such a profilic independent designer. I don't think I've played a game as much as this one, ever - and that includes the time when I was really crazy about RftG. Of course, the online client helps a lot with that, and I guess the fact that the AI sucks makes me play more games against fellow players, too.

Really, I can't recommend this game enough. Fairly easy rules, but right under the surface, there's tons of strategy, for every character different ways to win, and all the psychological back-and-forth - it's great.

I want to trade one copy of the complete edition (all ten characters of the first series, with playmats and all) because I have two of them.

As a big fan of fighting games, I want to like Yomi. On paper, it has all sorts of things which are good selling points: a 10 (now 20) character roster which have different approaches and it's been balanced to death (a narrative heavily invested in by the designer). 

However, the game's central mechanic -- rock, paper, scissors -- despite building upon it with [i]multiple[/i] special abilities to complexify it is somewhat mechanically uninspired and uninspiring. Not only did this leave me feeling that my efforts to learn the decks (i.e., both sides of the matchups) and their multiple unique cards (required to play at a competent level) would not be enjoyable or enjoyed; but worse, I've rarely felt that fighting games (which Yomi attempts to embody) could ever be reduced to rock-paper-scissors. The latter is too much thematic reductionism for me.

Preliminary Thoughts:

Yet another Sirlin game that I enjoy.

Yomi has a lot going for it. I'm a big fan of games where you need to sync up with another person and try to get in their head. Yomi is essentially a constant cycle of that, with interesting resource management decisions about when to go for the kill.

The matchups have all seemed balanced so far. Much like BattleCon, matchups tend to shift what your important cards are, as opposed to just letting you repeat the same strategies. Similarly to BattleCon, there seems to be a good mix of both question and answer characters.

I seem to recall Sirlin saying that his Fantasy Strike games are about distilling specific aspects of fighting games. Yomi maps really well to my days of sitting in people's basements playing the same Soul Calibur matchup for hours. After 40-50 reps of the same two characters, the fights started being about learning how your opponent tended to sequence moves, and trying to get in their head and exploit that. Yomi encapsulates that perfectly, and there is a great rush when you can line up four or five reads in a row.

Characters Owned:
Round 1, Round 2, Persephone, Menelker, Argagarg Garg, Zane, Vendetta, Lum, Valerie.

RATING: 6
Street Fighter wrapped up in a box.  That's right, it is a very good competitive fighting game that feels and looks like a video game.  It takes the cat and mouse aspect of competitive fighting games and turns it into a card game.  Very easy mechanic but very very deep game play.  The first few times it will feel like luck but after a few plays you will start to see the brilliance of this game.

This one definitely lives up to its hype. It is fun and easy to play, but filled with a lot of strategic play as well with special powers unique to each character. I also love the poker aspects, the bluffing elements, and the use of straights to dig for your aces. Good times!

Initial Rating: 7.5 (April 2012)

I liked Yomi, however it´s been more than a year since I last played it so I don´t remember many game nuances (and I played it on the PC). I have it and I hope to play it again soon.

As I’m reorganizing my ratings and keep them updated, I have to downgrade Yomi´s rating to a level that matches my feelings toward the game with the BGG recommendation system. To me, it is now a 6.0, a game I will play from time to time if I’m in the right mood. As I intent to play it soon, this rating could change upward again.

When I play again I will re comment and re rate if necessary. 

Current Rating: 6.0

I finally played Yomi face to face! And it was a blast. Much better that I anticipated! We liked it so much we played it many times in a row! It does a great job of portraying Street Fighter to boardgame format.

Reading the rulebook, Yomi seemed like a complex game full of rules, but it is pretty easy to teach (you can do it under 8 minutes) and all the rules´ exceptions are on the cards themselves, so it is pretty easy rules wise. Its playtime is around 30 minutes. 

I LOVE that there are many characters for you to try. Each character does feel very different than any other and that’s great! (high replay factor). You have to adapt your strategy for your character and the one your opponent is using. Furthermore, the characters seem balanced!

There is a lot of luck with the game (luck of the draw luck in combat) but it can be, somewhat, mitigated by clever play. You know the stats of each character and you try to read the game situation. It is much better than I thought it could be.

The cards are very flimsy, you need to play with sleeves. The art is ok, but it could be a lot better. The art on the power cards (K,Q, J, A) is very good.

Bottom line, I really enjoy Yomi and I can’t wait to play it again. Now I’m keen on trying the Indines series of games (which many gamers report is even better than Yomi). I think I will buy all there is for the game.

One of 2011´s favorites.

Its a nice quick filler game.  At its core, its nothing more than an advanced game of paper, rock, scissors.  It probably does not warrant the price tag, but I still like it for what it is.

RATING: 10
Probably the best Sirlin game, Yomi is a very strategic card game consisting of 10 complete "decks" (characters). Players play an RPS-esque game between attacks, throws, and block/dodge. However, each character comes with a unique ability (such as Jaina's burning vigor, which allows her to buy back cards at the cost of valuable HP, or Rook's rock armor, which allows him to power through quick attacks at the cost of extra cards) and their own unique moves/move distribution (for instance, Rook focuses a lot on throwing and is incapable of dodging while Setsuki has a lot of high speed attacks and quick dodges), so a lot of the strategy involved also includes evaluating what cards are useful against whom, as well as the titular "Yomi", which is the skill of predicting your opponent's moves by getting into their head. The inherent RPS element allows any character to win, and most matchups are very close to even, with only a few (still very winnable) exceptions. This game is absolutely worth every penny.

RATING: 8
Addictive card game designed to mimic "street fighting" video games (never played one)--but reminds me of Pinochle!  If you "win" the trick (rock paper scissors), then can add a further "combo" for added points. A nice mix of hand management and bluffing. I keep alternating between thinking this game is "all luck" but then good players keep beating me.

Excellent game, interesting design.  I love games like this, where you have to get into the opponent's mind, and predict their next move.  War for Edah was way too fiddly, but Yomi feels like a better, tightened War for Edah in some respects.  I am sure I'll be playing a ton of Yomi in the future.

Only recently found out about this game but I am currently hooked.

Yomi is the ultimate read-your-opponent game. The link to arcade fighter games makes it very appealing to a certain audience (guys). The 10 included decks give you unlimited replay-value, but getting to know one character and one opponent gives access to what this game is about: figuring out what's happening inside your opponents mind and tricking him/her into thinking that you're not thinking what's expected of you.

The first thing I always have to say when rating games like this is that I don't care for the theme and I really dislike the artwork.  That said, I try not to let my personal biases get in the way and the game is quite enjoyable.  I feel like I have a little more information to make decisions on as opposed to pure doublethink games like Die Mauer.

The combos are fun and I look forward to exploring all of the characters.

RATING: 5
Way too rock-paper-scissors for my liking. The game has a good level of complexity -- light enough to learn easily. Unfortunately its overshadowed by the simple fact that you are simply trying to pick a move that counters what your opponent is playing. 

If you happen to be very good at reading other people, you will win. Its that simple. No other skill comes into play.

RATING: 9
Normally, two-player card games along these lines aren't really my thing, but Yomi offers quite a bit of replayability, and its gleeful adoption of rock-scissors-paper makes it better than just about any CCG-style game out there. 

I do have a few complaints - I wish the design weren't quite so silly. (On one of the player boards: a woman with suspenders but her ass hanging out? And another one with, as my opponent Paul noticed, "bollocks?" An accidental triumph for the transgendered gaming community, I guess...) The card names are like the names of the spells in Final Fantasy VII, that is to say, things like "Crimson Passion." The character names are ridiculous ("Argagarg Garg"). 

But it's all so happily absurd that it's tough not to fall a little in love with it. 

It's quick, the decisions are interesting, and if the rulebook is opaque, it's still a damn good game, assuming we were playing it right. (Hyphz's clarified rules are a must-print.) Need to play more to determine balance. I killed as Valerie against Lum. Maybe playing CC:A stylee is best, where you switch decks after a game and count your health as points.

I want to like Yomi a lot. And I do. But I'm not in a social situation where I can get this to the table that often. So until that happens I have to give it a middling rating because it's good and I know that I like it and I know that I want to play it more...but I haven't played it nearly enough to know how much I will like it in the long run. Strong potential to rise up, if I can ever get this to the table on a regular basis.

I’ve played Yomi a ton since 2010, and struggled with “what exactly it is” the entire time. I’ve watched the best players playing tournament games, listened to as much commentary as any, had numersous conversations with the designer and lead playtesters, read strategy guides, beta tested the expansion, and have played probably about 1000 matches.

The game should probably not be called Yomi, (which means “reading” in Japanese) because the “reading” aspect of the game is basically a lie. Like, it requires “faith” on the part of the player, or if you like, a kind of gambler’s fallacy. You need to “believe” that your reasoning for why you chose to play an attack has anything to do with the fact that it actually was a hit. In reality, it could – and frequently does – have nothing to do with your reasoning.

This fact – that the yomi is not actually a thing – is made extra clear by the fact that many high level players play the game with a *random number generator* dictating to them which combat option they should play (you could have read all about that on Fantasystrike’s forums, but unfortunately the thread was deleted).

Now, that does not mean that there is no skill to the game. There is actually still a lot of skill to the game, but it has nothing to do with reading. It has everything to do with the other half of playing Yomi – “hand valuation”. Maintaining power at the right times, keeping a healthy hand, playing combos, and knowing when to use all your damage potential are part of this hand valuation aspect, which IS actually a real thing, and I think represents 99% of the actual skill of the game. This is why I think the game should be called “valuation” rather than “yomi”.

Unfortunately, the “yomi” part comes into play every single turn whether you ignore it or not. This means that you will get some VERY WILD swings of randomness in the outcomes of the game. For example, while I’ve played the game a ton, I have played a tiny, tiny fraction of the amount some of the best players have played – like maybe 1/100th the number of games that some of the best players have. Yet I recently had a situation where I beat one of the world’s top 10 Yomi players three times in a row in a best of 5. Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like that should never happen. I shouldn’t even win 1 out of 3 games, let alone 3/3.

So, Yomi is an interesting game, but I think it’s just way too direct and random, which means that it’s really frustrating and you have to play 20 matches with someone to find out who’s better. It’s kind of like playing Street Fighter, if you were playing on a stage that was tiny, like a small box that could just barely fit Ken & Ryu, and they were doing moves point-blank at all times.

RATING: 6
Does exactly what it sets out to do: it simulates video fighting games perfectly. The art is great, the gameplay on each turn is quick. Some of the cards could use more explanation, and it desperately needs some printed examples of play. Yomi is not as fun to lose as some other games, because the amount of damage each character can take makes the game increasingly repetitive. It becomes a numbers game of slowly whittling down your opponents. Still, the variety of characters included here gives the game good replay value, if you can overlook the sometimes monotonous play.

Who knew rock-paper-scissors could be so much fun. With each player playing a standard deck of poker cards (modified with character specific abilities) the  rules are very simple yet the play is quite engaging. Some familiarity with the cards played and combo ability can make for some nice comebacks and each deck seems to be well balanced. My 9yo daughter enjoys playing this with me a lot and it is very portable so it is great for traveling. Highly recommended.

Utterly dull... HUGE advantage if you sit and read all the cards before a game - Just kills the game for - if it was great then maybe - but a silly little game like this - nah...

Its seems a shame that there isn't a little bit more to it - something public that you can base your moves on. Having the one 'guess what the other guy is going to do' trick played over and over gets old pretty quickly...

Maybe some kind of 'permanent' cards that stay in play would give the game om kind of 'development' or arc...

RATING: 6
It's okay.  We had the luck or bad luck of just buying the panda and argagarg decks to start out with, so the game seemed really really fun, those decks are different and fun and the characters have fun abilities.  Unfortunately most of the other decks are just boring or annoying.  The game also gets really really similar after a few plays.  It really is just paper rock scissors with a few other things put in (enough little things that it's hard to remember them all and makes it hard to come back to after not playing for a while).  So it's a quickish, fun game, for a little while, but pretty disappointing too.  It's fun at first to guess or not guess what your opponent is going to do.  But that gets pretty old after a little while, because that's ALL the game is.  But, it's still much better than many other games and it is quick and fun, so I'm not totally against it.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable one-on-one fight game where each player takes a character and it's appropriate deck and duels one another.  Each deck uses a standard 54-cards (with two jokers) and their respective decks are tailored to each character/role with special powers.  The central mechanism is a combat simulation menu that is very similar to Rock Paper Scissors.  I might enjoy it more and rank it higher as I learn more of the nuances of each character and their prefixed decks.

LIKES:

* I appreciate games where you try to figure out what the other person is doing and try to play to top that card.  Yeah, I guess I could just say rock, paper, scissors.  
* This game is nicely honed to play quickly in the RPS system with some solid enhancements with special abilities for each of the 10 characters that need to be taken into account and varying amount of types of cards accordingly.
* Speed of play, ease of instruction are all positives.
* I could see this becoming a solid opener or closer with only two people.  Once you know how to play, games can be completed in 10 minutes or less.

DISLIKES:

* Cost.  Yes, I understand the arguments on both sides but ultimately, I come down on the side that for a stack of cards, the cost feels excessive.  I understand there has been extensive playtesting and all that, but...

Definitely like the "reading" part of this game.  I had one game where I just spanked the other player and then later the same player scored a perfect game on me.  That second game I just couldn't read him at all.  I also kept second guessing my choices of cards.

This game is perfect for when I am in a Street Fighter mood but don't want to have to button mash to win.

RATING: 6
* Rules

- The rule book is one of the worst I have ever read (in about 100 games): it is imprecise and incomplete,â€¦

* Game play

- The various special powers are a little complicated to get used to: some cards go from the discard pile back to your hand under certain conditions, some cards can be played for some unusual effects, characters have abilities that take a while to get used to,â€¦   If the special powers had a stronger thematic flavor, I could remember them more easily, but it is currently quite hard for me to make sense of them.  So, if I am to play a game with special powers, I currently prefer playing Magic: the Gathering.

- Playing the card that starts a combat feels a little random/hollow to me: I am always afraid to waste a good card for not much.  I guess that I should accept the randomness, and know that I can only expect probabilities of winning, but it still does not feel comfortable to play quite blindly, and to lose a good card for only probabilistic reasons.  I may also not be very sensitive to the pleasure of outguessing my opponent: I feel too much randomness and dullness in reasonings of the form "I know that he thinks that I know that he knows, so…".

- The problem I have with Yomi, currently is that it is a game whose state and history does not really appear on anything concrete (no tiles, cards left in front of the players, etc.).  I feel even worse than with Summoner Wars, where units die so fast that they leave little trace of their effect on the game state, which makes each game more forgettable.

* The AI

- The AI is great for learning the rules, and for getting a feel for how the game really plays.

If you give this game a few plays with the same decks this becomes so much fun ! Many people aren't impressed after a first play but this one deserves a more patient approach. Can't think of a better way to simulate a fighting game with cards. So much time was put in balancing this game it really deserves more love !
Perfect game for couples because the more you play one person the better the game gets as you know the playstyle of the opponent and more and more thinking ahead happens naturally. Also you start to develop favorite characters to play.

Wow, played this at CABS with Cody and was very amazed.  The decks are great and art beautiful, the cards feel nice.  The characters are statistically balanced according to the designer's website, so that's nice.  It was a lot of fun, and I found I really like this kind of thinking game.  Would be great to get, despite it being kind of expensive.

The online PnP files are all nicely updated, though, with Grave and Jaina for free, so I'd much rather buy those $5 pdfs and print out over time than buy a complete first edition anyway.

One of the best two player games.
I would say that it is as good as Blue Moon for me and it means something.
Yomi is something different and I even think that more "mine" mechanic.
The tension during play is for me very high.
Great game.
This asumes to simulate Tekken and such video games.
But it is BETTER.
I hesitate to give it a 9 but it can be 9 very soon.

Attractive looking paper-scissor-rock game where you draw the paper-scissor-rocks. If your rock beats a scissor, you then manage the rest of your diminishing hand on whether you want to make the rock bigger. Plus, the game is atrociously expensive for what it is.

The thought of a card game that is a fighting game seems quite awkward. I questioned how well this would even translate. The answer is, this IS a fighting game. Though there is no need for spacing between you and your opponent, practicing timings, and executing button presses, the heart of what makes a fighting game lies at the core of this game. A fighting game is essentially rock, paper, scissors. But the different benefits of each decision allows you to really try and gauge what your opponent will do, and stuff them for every mistake they make. 

Though this is indeed a card game, the luck of the draw often won't win you the game. The cards in your hand will usually give you the option to do what you'd like. But there are times where you wish you had a different hand, but this is quite rare I find.

Like Puzzle Strike, each character has a very different feel and it's exciting to learn the matchups between them all. There seems to be a wide array of styles: rushdown, turtling, combo kings. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After more plays, I'm dropping the rating from a 9.5 to an 8. It's still sort of fun to play but now it feels like merely a rock, paper, scissors game than fighting game. My performance in a game seems to be mostly due to luck.

Excellent 2-player fighting game.  It makes me think of playing Soul Calibur II, with the rock-paper-scissors method it uses (Attacks beat Throws, Throws beat Blocks/Dodges, Blocks/Dodges beat Attacks).  This is probably the best implementation of a fighting game you could ever get in a card game.

I like how each special fighter has his/her own style and different attacks, throws, and blocks, and different speeds and strengths for each.  The fact that each deck has its own unique back is just an added bonus.

Overall, it's a great game, and I think it'll see a lot of plays.  

[i]*Own the First Edition set with all 10 characters and the bonus mats and such.  Also own the Yomi: Cursed Cards.

The last few days I played Yomi online. Maybe it isn't the same as with a real life person sitting in front of me (how can I read my opponent if he/she isn't visible?). I must say I compare this with the Flash Duel experience, which is of course wrong. But the Yomi gameplay doesn't do it for me. I still have the feeling that it is a bit luck based: I should probably play it more to get the Yomi-feeling. There are some tactical desicions and it's very creative to upgrade a rock-paper-scissors game to this game with a complete universe/story. For that is the 0.5 point up. I think for the Fantasy Strike universe Flash Duel is the most appropriate game.

Edit: remove my previous sentence... I played Yomi a lot more, my rate is going up. I still have a feeling that there's much luck in the game, but I start to like it. It really represents a fighting game for me, because my adrenaline is going crazy when it's a tight game. I own the Argagarg and Mistress Persephone online versions.

Edit 2: after many plays online, I fell for it. I can't describe it, but it's almost a kind of addiction... Good work, mr. Sirlin!

Edit 3: the urge to play is gone, but the 8 stays. It's a nice, likeable game to play once in a while. Mechanics not too difficult to understand, but really fun and exciting.

Edit 4: the game stays an 8, but I don't play it very often anymore and when I do it is online. Ready to part with the beautiful box.

Having the chance to play with only the beta print and play version, the full version must be a outstanding piece of work. Ten decks of cards representing ten completely different fighters, dueling through a greatly enhanced rock-paper-scissors system, paired with marvelously artistic cards, is a mind-blowingly exciting experience. Each decks requires a slightly different mindset to play out, and combined with the high variety of characters, Yomi has an excellent replay value.

I used to play this with my brother a lot. 

A lot of mind games and the better player will win most of the time.

Several different characters to choose from which keeps it fresh and interesting. Each of them played differently, but repeat plays of the same deck will reward the player since they will get better with that deck.

Wonderful title, I just dont like that Sirlin re-releases the decks with fixes to balance it out. While that is better for the game overall, it kinda leaves people with the physical product on a branch. So while I understand why Sirlin does it, it doesn't feel good as a consumer.

Game in a Nutshell: Paper, rock, scissors style card game in the vane of the old 16bit fighters where each character has their own style and special moves.

Played as: Complete First Edition. The game is two-player only.

Pros: Such a simple premise, executed in a way that becomes so much more. I love the matching of wits. This is the first game that I've ever played that only takes 10-15 minutes for a game but I can play over and over, seemingly with only a desire to play more. The reason why is that each fighter really does feel unique. It's like a game with 10 totally balanced paths to victory for you to fully discover with the added variety that depending on the match-up, there's even more adjustments to make in order to come out on top. The card quality seems to be among the highest I've ever seen.

Cons: There's a game or two learning curve where the things can feel kind of chaotic. $$$. Despite being a game that's rapidly climbing the ranks as one of my favorites, I don't think I'll ever be able to give my full recommendation in good conscience due to the price of entry. Is there value in the price? Yes. Does it cost more than I feel it should? Yes... 

Other: I doubt this will ever be a game for everyone. People who prefer to get lost in a game's mechanics, and want only an open information game of crunching numbers / building engines will find this an exercise in random frustration. Those who like to stare down their opponent, get in their head, and talk some trash will probably have a blast.

Best Use: Any two people who like games where you play the player more so than the game.

Rock, paper, scissors? Seriously? And if you "win" RPS, you can play some more cards to score points unless your opponent plays a Joker, or something like that? What?

This "game" is yet another reason why I simply can't take Eurogamers seriously when they complain about luck/inelegance/lack of depth in wargames and AT. Are you kidding me?

I know, I know, you have to play it a few hundred more times to fully appreciate the subtlety and depth of this gem and know the true joy of spending $100 for it. Except I don't hate myself enough to spend countless hours of my life playing RPS in the hope that I will learn to love all things Yomi. If I let someone hit me with a 2x4 1,000 times, maybe Jessica Alba will feel sorry for me and do unspeakable, wildly pleasureable things to me. Maybe. But I'm inclined to think the odds of any payoff at all are very, very slim. I'd rather do something more fun, like perform elective surgery on myself or eat a porcupine.

I don't know whether this is 5% skill or 20% skill or what. It's a low number, but I don't care to quibble about it. Arguing about Yomi ranks somewhere between "Chop off own toe" and "Watch Pauly Shore career retrospective" in appeal. If you care about me at all (and of course you do, you're reading my internet scribblings), you will not ask me to do any of those things.

I really don't care if Mr. Sirlin is The 100-Foot Jesus or A Pulsating Bag of Devil Goo: If his game is good, I'll buy it and/or play it. His game is...well, if you've been following along, you already know how I feel about that.

I wish I had won this from the Play and Win table at Geekway to the West so that I could have traded it for a bunch of good games. Then I could laugh and laugh and laugh each time I played one of those, imagining a couple of deadly serious, scowling Eurogamers hunched over their Yomi decks, grinding away at glorified RPS and congratulating themselves on what refined taste they have.

Games are supposed to be fun. I heard that somewhere, and it might even be true.

Remdinded me of Brawl but rather than real-time plays more like a simple CCG.  It's hard not to compare it to the Street Fighter video-game but with a rock-paper-scissors mechanic.  Definitely one of those games that rewards repeated plays as getting to know the deck of your fighter (and your opponent's for that matter) can really lead to some great combos.  Since actions arise via simultaneous selection there's a bit of a psychological feel too.

Aggregating all plays under original Yomi.

I like Yomi. It's a good game that has a high price point. 
I think it simulates well the footsie- and mixup battles from fighting games. Hell, it even has okizeme!

Yomi plays fast, has very little requirements for table space, has a very clear manual, surprisingly varied characters, a good mix of skill and luck (with the better player taking most wins), really nice art, good balance throughout the characters and abilities and as such, rewards multiple plays and regular opponents.

However, Yomi is also expensive, has a good amount of text that you need to understand, has a theme that will not appeal to everyone, is really confrontational and competitive, could really benefit from better card stock and/or sleeves (that will bring the price up), has no storage solution for sleeved cards aside from acquiring boxes for all fighters, and, much like Race For the Galaxy, can be really harsh for new players when they play anyone who know what they are doing.

I was also very surprised that Yomi and Battlecon can coexist so well in my shelf. They both share mechanism and thematic elements, but are wholly different beasts. I liken Battlecon to anime fighters with outlandish abilities and emphasis on spatial control and active evasions, whereas Yomi is about applying pressure and performing mixups, much like in Tekken, Virtua Fighter or DoA.

I think that the free-to-play trial of Yomi that can be played at fantasystrike.com is something that most people should try.

Street Fighter card game! I'm convinved that this game is not all about how lucky you are. You really have to read your opponent for information. How many cards does he have left? Did he grab aces yet? Have you seen jokers played? What are his strengths? What style of a player is he? etc. You can make a pretty well informed choice after that. And every deck plays so differently, which keeps the replayability up.I wish my wife was into it more.

A design that continues to dazzle the more I play it.

A short length, fast-paced, high replay value riff on poker by cross-pollinating with classic console fighting games.  Delve into an anime-esque character in their own bout of Mortal Kombat, using combos and having the speed of your attack actually matter less than what you decide to try and do (attack, block/dodge, throw)... just like a fighting game.

The art is fun, the play mats are great tactile pieces to the game.  Easy to wile away multiple games without even considering a look at the clock.  A newer version of this has been released which is even MORE expensive - but I am happy with the version I have.

Yomi is David Sirlin's online persona in a nutshell. It's obsessed with and takes pride in tournament balance and has its niche crowd of hardcore 1337 players, thus totally failing on delivering a good first experience. The quality of aesthetics and the character roster look like a good omen (even if the sexualisation of all the female ones is sad), but unfortunately for the new player it's a very, very confusing rock-paper-scissors with lots of sub-rules that won't click during the first ten games. If you can convince somebody that after this stage they will understand a thing or two, good for you. But unless it's under a very simple ruleset to help bearing with those ten games, neither I nor my friends are your audience.

Sirlin might argue that versus fighting video games, the scene he's coming from, also has a steep learning curve where beginners are randomly mashing buttons for a while and still having fun. But while newbies "have no idea what they're doing", the screen still offers some satisfying sound and video feedback. Here you're just left with "having won at rock-paper-scissors", which is hardly exciting. Plus if you really want to learn a fighting game, results of experimentation are re-usuable immediately, while Yomi (a quite longer game) relies on whole decks of cards that have two modes each, double digits and special abilities to be learnt by heart prior to doing anything remotely interesting.

Fun! This is a quick game of strategic rock-paper-scissors.  The characters have different play styles so there is real strategy and not just random guesswork.  There is a lot of variance in this one, but it plays so quickly that it is not a big deal to me.  The best player will not win every game, but the best player will likely win 5/9 etc.  Feels much like street fighter in card game form.

Edit: Finally got someone capable to get in to this a little bit and play a series of games.  The stakes are high with the implied bragging rights, and the game is even better now.  The strategy and mind games are awesome, and I love that it is playable in under 15 minutes (even with new characters/match-ups).  With enough people interested in playing, I could see tournaments with each person picking a unique character being a lot of fun.

Any game of Rock/Paper/Scissors can be meaningful if there's something at stake, same as Poker becomes meaningful with money at stake. But here we have a 2 player RPS variant with nothing at stake except the potential fun of playing and the pride of win/loss. And there's only so much fun to be gained by simultaneous revelation after simultaneous revelation trying to outguess your opponent. There's no doubt some subtleties in the decks, playing to deck strengths, and knowing opponent's deck strengths, but they're just another source of input in trying to outguess your opponent each turn. And the turns come thick and fast, so the sense of meaningless repetition arrives fast as well. When compared to the amazing number of strong 2 player card games out there, this mechanic just doesn't cut it for me.

RATING: 10
My first impression of the game is that it is simple to play and understand right off the bat. As the game measures in large part the ability to read the opponent, it is not difficult to come close to winning or win against more experience players when starting out. Even when losing, it's easy to see what went wrong and what should have been played.

Despite this simplicity picking up the game, it is obvious even as a beginner how to improve your overall gameplay - better hand management, and changing up playstyle to beat a specific enemy character better. Hand management has a lot of interesting options, at its most basic between saving attacks for combos or 'buying' powerful super attacks.

Perhaps more importantly, the game is just fun. Even when faced with a large health disadvantage, the game is never over, and no move is safe! Seemingly terrible moves can catch the opponent off guard and win matches, and flashy powerful looking supers can be made useless by a good decision. This definitely keeps matches exciting.

I especially reccomend this game if you are someone who likes fighting games but can never get past the joystick gymnastics required to play at the highest level!

The stated goal of the game is to be the most minimal version of RPS that's actually interesting, and it does that job pretty well. It's an elegant, thematic, and clever design, backed by solid production values and extensive playtesting. A good choice if you're looking for some quick, solid fun, with enough depth to support a fair number of plays. The game takes a bit of time to pick up, though, so it's probably best to stick to a single matchup and a single opponent at first, and expand to other characters later on.

Amazingly deep game.  The seemingly simple gameplay mechanics mask a game that is as versatile and deep as it is fun.  This game perfectly extracts the valuation and mindgames of a good 2-d fighting game while leaving out the undesirable stuff such as the need to memorize long combo strings or to rely on tests of manual dexterity.

I don't enjoy the rock, paper, scissors mechanic, and I'm not a big fan of games which are based around memorizing card combinations.

It's a well designed game, but I just don't like it.

A really unique game, but based on a concept most is familiar with. The game here is more in your mind than in the components. Easily one of my most challenging games.

Some find the graphic design on the cards confusing. I don't, but it is unconventional.

RATING: 8.5
Pretty damn solid for a 1v1, fancified rock-paper-scissors.

There's a fair amount of depth here, but not as much as the cultish enthusiasts would like you to believe.

That said, if you have solid card-valuation, a good sense of reading your opponent, and enjoy variable character abilities, you should check this out.

Got this got in PnP version two days ago. A buddy and me read the rules (about 20-30 min) and made the ten decks of 56 cards. This takes quite alot of time, cutting and assembling the paper in a deckprotector with a MtG card as a thickener. 
But the pricetag of 14.99 $ makes up for it!
Instead of the hardbox complete first edition which is 99$ + postage to denmark.

We haven't been doing a lot but playing this game since I got it.

Although a simple rock, paper, scissors game, it is surprisingly complex and with a short playing time. You get to learn and love it pretty quick, but it keeps getting more intriquate and interesting. Love comboing for 46 damage with Lum's "Great Pandamonium"

Looking forward to STREET FIGHTER, TEKKEN and MORTAL COMBAT versions. Or TRANSFORMERS.

Highly recommended!

As a GIGANTIC Street Fighter fan since 1990 (when it arrived here in Italy.. I was 17 years old) I greatly appreciate a game like this. Really, it is a beat'em up on paper.. or well, on cards! The game itself has a winning combo for my tastes: it is simple to learn, but hard to master. That's a rare thing, which I like in card/boardgames. The artwork is very well done too.

A real pity it is not based on the original Street Fighter license... sigh

And the price is quite high too...

Don't have the complete set, only the two-pack Jaina and Grave combo. It's ok, I guess. I'm a bit lukewarm towards it.

I've been playing this game pretty regularly for a couple years now and I'm still enjoying it. It has a great deal of depth without requiring knowledge of tons of tiny technical details. 

Yomi also has room for fantastic comebacks without warping the gameplay. The game has variance in terms of draws, but the bluffing elements allow players to compensate for weak draws and the power-up mechanic does well in preventing bad hands. The game also has enough options that strong players can find places to eek out advantages (like bluff jokers) even if they fall behind.

Usually balk at two player card games, especially direct combat, but this one is working well. I really like bluffing games, and the variable powers for each character give the game a fresh feel. Definitely not easy to jump directly into (get a friend to explain the rules), but it is working well as a first-up filler.

Fun - though I need more plays to fully assess.

RATING: 10
I like it. I really do. It's rather simple really, you pick a card and choose which side you want to play as each card has 2 functions. Then you reveal and compare yours to his. Attacks beat throws, throws beat blocks/dodges and blocks/dodges beat attacks. It's rock-paper-scissor in terms of LEARNING how to play the game. This is akin to saying all you need to do in basketball is to shoot a ball in a hoop.

The second aspect of the game is that the goal is to take out your opponent and get them to 0 health. This is where attacks and throws are the ones to play. So while you can block, attacks and throws are the ones that win you the game. So why would you block? Blocking gives you cards which then give you more throws and attacks. Have the right cards and you can unleash devastating combos that can take out half of an opponent's life. Unlike rock-paper-scissors, each choice has a different function attached to it. Each choice is NOT the same.

I do like the game and it allows for very, very intense games. I remember a game where I got down to 7 health with my opponent having spent all but 2 of his cards. Slowly, but surely, I managed to correctly guess about 9 times and I beat him when he had full health. At the same time, the game can feel frustrating because each play ends up with you not guessing right.

If the game just feels like luck for you, the "optimal" way to play is to play blocks a lot early on to build hand size. Lay some devastating combos in the middle game with your big hand. Then sneak in the final hits with dodges or fast attacks in the late game. Since this is pretty much the blueprint to playing the game well, the game gets more interesting when another player knows this. Should you block, since they know the block-attack-dodge(BAD) pattern? Or maybe you should throw because they will block?

Played one game so far. Really nice system. At first when reading the rules it sounded complicated. But it's really not. Especially with how clear the cards are. Also the fact that all the cards double as poker cards at first scared me this was gonna be some damn 'skinned' copy of some old card game. But no, the game really is it's own game.

Yet another 2-player game that I really wanted to love, but that my wife didn't like - so unfortunately I have got little play with this :(

I love 2-player games like this, with relatively simple rules (although many of the details here can be tricky, as in many card games), but with sufficient depth that one can play them many times and still learn new things. From the large number of strategy articles that I have seen and read, both on BGG and on Sirlin's forums, I know that this is the case with Yomi.

I was never a fighting-game player (I never saw any skill in them other than being able to press lots of buttons very fast, but I now see that I was wrong about that), so that aspect of the game doesn't appeal to me. But the mechanics of this game I think are great - essentially rock-paper-scissors guessing, but where based on the game state and what's in your hand, you can tell which "guess" will be optimal for you. And, of course, if your opponent knows what you're likely to play, and you know they know, the mind games can start...

Not that I ever got to this stage in my plays, nor do I expect that I will. But I think it has the potential to be one of the best - and most different - 2-player card games out there.

This elaborate Rock, Paper, Scissors game is right up my 13-year-old son's alley.

Rock-paper-scissors turned into pure awesomeness.  Unlike RPS, where you're purely guessing what your opponent is going to do, in Yomi there is information available.  For instance, are they low on cards?  Then they might be blocking soon to try and pick up more cards.  Did they just search their discards and put some Aces in their hand?  Well guess what you can expect eventually?  On the flip side, you know that they know what you *should do, so do you mix it up?  The tension of each turn is great, and the game is quick paced.

Two Player Value = Excellent


Yomi truly is a beautiful game.

The cards are gorgeous. The play mats are gorgeous. The mechanics are gorgeous.

This game is simply fun to play as well. Once you learn the system it is fast and frantic brutality. Great two player game. The game really does carry the feeling of being in a street fighting video game.

Yomi uses a wonderful new representation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanic. It sounds silly at first , but it plays great and lends itself very well to the competitive street fighting theme.

Each turn each player selects one card to play. Certain card types trump other card types, hence the Rock, Paper, Scissor mechanic. The winning player is allowed to play more cards to damage their opponent. Choosing the correct card is important.

Each card is also dualistic. The top and bottom of each card is different and can be used either way. It gives the players a wide possibility of options and keeps the game lively.

On the bad side, the game is little difficult to learn from reading the rules. In fact, the rules says very little. Learning the game comes from actually playing the game. You just have to muscle your way through the first game and figure it out as you go. But it is worth it.


Pros - 
- Great fighting mechanic
- Gorgeous
- Truly feels like a fighting game

Cons - 
- Difficult to learn from the rules that can cause a rough first few games
- High price for what is basically Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is for the addition of the [thing=96721][/thing] expansion.

The [thing=96721][/thing] changes the game by handicapping each character.  Each curse hurts the character in a specific way as make the character less powerful.

This is an example of a great expansion.  It changes the base game just enough without hurting the base game in any way.  This expansion is clean and easy to use.

This is cool new trick and can help the game in two ways -
 - It can make the game more silly and fun 
 - It can help balance the game so that new or inexperienced players can compete against better players

This is an example of a great expansion.  It changes the base game just enough without hurting the base game in any way.

Pros - 
- Expensive
- Adds just enough to the base game without any negatives

Cons - None

A fighting card game, reminds you of childhood, huh? One card deck for each characters, which makes it very expanable. The idea is intriguing, but the replayability is a concern.

In the abstract sense Yomi is an impressive design. In practice it has a very strange rules-vs.-complexity ratio. It can be contained on about one sheet of paper, but requires playing over and over again with the same people to really pay off.

Complete First Edition: I was always rubbish at playing Street Fighter, but I enjoyed watching my mates slug it out. Yomi translates SF to a form that I can actually play, and I so far am finding it delightful.

There's a lot that's impressive about the game. I love games that are simple to explain - though that means that the nuances in Yomi can translate as fiddliness - nonetheless, it should only take a quick bout or two for most people to pick the thing up - and the fact that it can be explained as Rock, Paper, Scissors - draw a card and play (then the nuances gone into as the game unfolds) is wonderful - though clearly a lot of BGGers have baggae associated to RPS (see most negative comments on this game for a sample). You can ignore RPS during play - you don't have to think about out-guessing your opponent - just try to make good moves with the cards you have. Sometimes you'll hit, and sometimes you'll be hit. Studies on RPS show that guessing randomly is the most effective strategy in that game. That simply ain't so with Yomi - because the value of any given card in any given situation is going to differ - with some characters a certain move will always be more likely, or more or less effective. It's very notable that the (consistently) top ranking players of Yomi are also poker professionals. Bluffing and reading bluffs are not the principal skills in professional poker - understanding the probabilities of any given card or play are much more significant. 

Anyhow, I like that you can take this game seriously and learn the decks and better plays, or you can just get into the fight and start punching and blocking as the whim takes you, or you can try get in your opponent's head and frustrate the heck out of them - any of which approaches to the game seems to be viable. Huge variability from the ten characters and corresponding match ups, and remarkable balance for the significantly differing powers, strengths and weaknesses. 

The designer's forthright and widely disemminated opinions clearly rub some up the wrong way. I'll take it as eccentricity. The design is unquestionably solid, and I for one appreciate that the game was designed as a whole, in a non-CCG, non-LCG model. Just like buying a cartridge of Street Fighter. I'll treat 2nd edition like SF II, and I guess if I get bored of 1st Edition some day, try and hunt it down. I'll happily try out someone else's 2nd edition, but I'm happy to stick with 1st for myself until I am finished with it.

A great card game. I am slightly turned off by the rock-paper-scissors mechanic because I often do quite badly at the yomi aspect of the game. The characters all play differently, and I really enjoy the valuation aspect of the game. You must consider hand management in order to play well, although some characters are more dependent on large hands than others. A good amount of strategy, with a dollop of randomness. Some characters are more prone to randomness than others. Seems well balanced overall. I really prefer BattleCON from a mechanical point of view, though I wish BattleCON was as well balanced. I wish Yomi had a positional element.

Rented from BoardGameExchange. I think if the card design wasn't made the look like a deck of playing cards I would like the game a little more. I think that we both got distracted a lot of the time by the look of the cards and that took away from the theme that we were actually in a street fighter type duel but were instead just playing down cards. It just didn't work all that well for us.
Unfortunately, as I really wanted to like this game, not recommended.

I guess this is rock-paper-scissors, but using your opponent's history to deduce an idea of what he has and predict what's coming next.

On one hand, it's cool that the 'what-you-have' deduction from traditional card games is isolated here without any surrounding fluff, but on the other hand, I don't like it bare-boned; I like it with good fluff, where it's still the main thing in the game but not the only thing.

Not sure about this since this is poster-child for "YOU DON'T GET IT" after 1 play. Feels weird that you might do better in this game if you play it completely randomly, and there's an illusion of doing well because you remember your successes more than your failures. I'll start this off at 3 for design, since this game feels more like a 'development' of childhood game components (RPS and poker deck) and playtesting than actual design. The artwork and integration of the fighter-game setting is pretty good (but more on the 'development' side).

[q="SirHandsome"]Along with reading your opponent, other skills that are rewarded in the game are hand management, figuring out how to play the different character matchups, evaluating the current game state to determine optimal moves for each side[/q]

2013: 7. I've played this game with a few people, and some dig it, and some don't.  I love the design, it's really really evocative of playing an actual one-on-one fighting game, "reading" a player's movements and getting into their head.

Unfortunately, I don't think it works as well when you're dealing with a more casual opponent, as their moves are less predictable, much like a pro who's playing against a "button masher".  So, more design points for even making *that* part of the game mirror the video game world. :)

I'm glad I went the print and play route, it took me along time to put together but was ultimately cheaper, and for the number of times I've pulled this game out, it would have felt like a waste of money to have paid for the full set and then have it sit there in the corner. :/

2014: 7. I think if I want to play a card game that simulates a fighting game, I'd rather play Brawl. But maybe I need to give this another chance...

Sirlin rates his own game a 10 here. I guess he will never fail to impress us how little class he has. When you are just beginning to think he finally hit the rock bottom, he pulls another ace up his sleeve.

It also amazes me how Yomi fanboys think that their rating of a game is objective, while mine is silly. I do consider this little game as that bad a joke. Do you still think you are the only ones who are entitled to have an opinion on the game? Holier than thou?

You're looking at 'Street Fighter' the card game. 

The base set has 10 different decks of cards representing the moves a fighter can make. It's essentially rock-paper-scissors (attack, throw, dodge/block) along with extra chrome. You can chain cards for combos and there's a 'poker' sub game where comboing with straights nets you ace cards. You can also discards pairs/three/four of a kind to fish aces. Aces are essentially powerful attack cards.

Games play fast and it's really about knowing the decks and more importantly, your opponents' mentality.

Only knock against it is the high price of entry. Ouch.

Very enjoyable. Still "just" RPS at its core, but Sirlin knows his RPS/fighting games and has implemented it into a card game very well.

Benefits strongly from repeat plays, both against the same or experienced opponents and getting more experience using/opposing each character. My first 10 plays were against the same person, each of us using the same decks in each game, and I think it helped us get into the game better.

I wanted to love this game. I do appreciate the art! And there is a neat mind game involved in the back-and-forth nature of the battle. You can also put together some combination moves, setting up your opponent for further damage. But even at its most complex, this mind game boils down to a shell game, and I just don't find that very interesting. Every turn, you need to guess what your opponent is going to do - based on their past actions, their "tells", and your knowledge of the game and their deck. Then, you choose an action in the style of rock-scissors-paper that will trump your opponent's action. Yomi is easy to pick up and learn, and very stylistic. But one of my measures of a good game is that when I lose, I get excited to play it again and try things a little differently. I never lost Yomi, yet even winning I was un-enthused about further plays. It just wasn't much fun for me. My opponents also were not excited about the game, and soured on it. Now - if I were to read what I just wrote, I'd start to wonder, "Wow, this guy must be a real stinker. I'll bet he's a poor winner and that's the real problem, not this game." Yet...we play tons of games around here and I've always got people asking me to play. So, no, it's Yomi. The game just isn't for us, I guess. In the words of my better half: "Yomi blows." That's her harshest indictment. She'd give the game a 3.

Short, simple and fun.  Wife liked it enough.  Don't know all the decks well yet at all.  Like the bluffing elements mixed and special abilities and chains.  Seems to allow a lot of room for strategy despite the rock/paper/scissors core mechanic.

RATING: 10
I love that tension in games when you aren't sure what to do, you aren't sure what the opponent is going to do, and you know the game hinges on this moment. Yomi has synthesised that down into one of the cleverest, deceptively complex games I have ever played. For me the huge advantage this game has over most is the brisk play time and the asymmetry. With a brisk play time you can very quickly achieve rules transparency and then genuine brain burning situations. The asymmetry adds a surprising amount of variety to the game. Each character has layers of depth, but between characters you get completely different match ups that need to be mastered and techniques of play. This will earn an eventual ten score if it hasn't already.

Gyönyörű kivitelezésű játék. Szemet gyönyörködtető rajzokkal illusztrált kártyák, jól kitalált karakterek, gyors, pörgős játék, a szabályai sem túl bonyolultak. Több játék után lehet kiismerni egy-egy karakter gyengéit és erősségeit, utána már kicsit mélyebben lehetne játszani velük, de nem nekem. Ugyanis ennyi jó után jöjjön a pontszám magyarázata is végre. Ez egy kő-papír-olló játék csodaszép köntösbe bújtatva, de ettől semmivel sem változik, hogy egyszerű szerencsén múlik minden. A játék végén semmivel sem éreztem, hogy jobb lettem volna az ellenfelemnél és jobb gondolkodással sikerült volna levernem, nem kb. semmilyen érzelmet nem váltott ki a játék, nem hittem el, hogy egy ilyen szép játék csak szimplán ennyi. Hiába a szép köntös nem hiszem, hogy többet leülnék vele játszani. Egy sima kockapóker legalább többen játszva jó hangulatot teremt és semmivel sem nagyobb benne a szerencse így maradok ezeknél ha átvezetőre vágyom.

[b]Best 2 Player Game Award[/b]

[b]100+ Logged Plays Award[/b]

Fresh experience that can be had nowhere else. And the fun factor is very very high. Don't really feel this level of excitement from any other game.

This is the kind of game you have to play multiple times with the same character to really "get it"... not to mention you need to understand your opponent's character as well. This means that the gameplay is deceptively simple because to an onlooker it seems like you're pretty much just trying to randomly counter your opponent on a turn-by-turn basis. It takes some games under your belt for the "bigger picture" to come into focus, so you can start planning for winning the war, rather than the battle.

Realizing that winning exchanges has unequal payoffs is a huge step towards "getting" this game. It's not just about predicting your opponents moves (though in theory, if you could predict correctly every time, you would never lose because the game is designed so that you almost always have a counter for each of your opponents short term options). 

If you're well versed in 2D fighting games like Street Fighter, then the concepts will really click with you fast. It feels just like you're playing a Street Fighter game, but with cards.

Between the heavily integrated fighting game theme and the first-appearance that it's a trivial, uninteresting game, this is definitely one for a niche audience and that can make it difficult to find opponents. But its a beautiful thing when both players "get it"

As you learn more about the characters and matchups, the game seems like it has a tendency to get scripted. And a game with this few options per turn, and such polarizing matchups usually would. But it is saved by its namesake "Yomi" mechanic -- the art of reading and adapting to your opponent. What becomes an "optimal" strategy in expert play always has a counter. You can never rely too heavily on your established strategies, because if you play in flowchart fashion, there is always a hard counter to your next move.

Therefore the game follows the following arc: 

Starts out rather random as two novices rely too much on the "Yomi" aspect of trying to outguess each other.

Evolves into a game of valuation. A player who knows the value of each play at any given time, and what his character's ideal move distributions are in a given matchup, will crush an opponent who does not.

And then finally, at an expert level, the mind-games and randomness aspect is rolled back in, but now in a much more satisfying way -- because the lines between an optimal move and a bad one are blurred. If both you and your opponent know the optimal move at any given time, and every move in the game can be countered if it can be predicted... then is it really the optimal move?

The answer lies in the middle ground. This game, at its highest level, becomes a mix of both Yomi (reading your opponent) AND valuation (judging the current game state correctly while planning future turns), so the designer absolutely accomplished his goals.

And it's a good thing, because this game relies on both of those elements. Without the valuation, it becomes a random game. And without the Yomi, it becomes repetitive and scripted.

The human element ensures that the game does not get stale, while the ever-changing game state challenges you to analyze abilities and known information to find the best move on any given turn... and then decide whether you want to use it, play it safe, or counter its counter.

RATING: 6.5
Rock, paper, scissors with hand management.  Cute system.  This is the kind of game where the subtitles will show themselves the more that you play the game and until you know your decks, it is the equivalent of playing Street Fighter for the first time and just trying to hit the other players.

That said, it is a card game, and if you don't draw well you don't get to see the characters shine.  So it can be a little frustrating.  

I kind of feel like the decks are too big.  It seems like there should only be three suits.  This would mean that your likelihood of getting dud games would go down as you would get to the meat of your deck and you wouldn't be subject to fluky shuffles.

I really hope that I would love this game. HAven't played it yet but I am so taken by the "fighting game concept" and of course, the beautiful ART!

Have finally played this many rounds in a day. IT is amazing. the mechanics represent the fighting game genre almost exactly. Does take a few plays when you use new characters to get use to a new play style...Which means, every of the ten decks you have, provide a different feel providing the opportunity for many interesting matches!

Lots of fun mindgames going on back and forth combined with some cool hand management make this a brilliant gem that is tasty little filler to spice up any 2-player game night.

Good game, and definitely feels like Street Fighter--or maybe Virtua Fighter, with its rock-paper-scissors style engine. It's a lot more than rock-paper-scissors, but it takes a few plays to see it. The problem with Yomi, aside from the price, is that it doesn't hook players right away. That means it'll be challenging to find opponents, and because I'm not interested in tournament play, it's hard to say how much play it'll see. If I had only one verb to describe my feelings toward Yomi, it would be "respect;" if I had only one adjective, "polished." Yomi asks and deserves to be played repeatedly, but probably won't be. But in the right context, with the right players, it's a great asymmetric game of hand management and valuation.

Yomi!  Fun little card game.  Too much text on the special cards for casual play and not deep enough for extended play.

Tried a couple games of this.  My initial reaction was kind of "meh" but I don't think I have fully explored the game enough to make that my final verdict.  At first play the game seems nothing more than glorified rock-paper-scissors to me.  However, I believe there is more strategy/tactics hiding in this package than I am currently aware of.  For that reason I would like to give it another try with some of the different characters.

Heavy on the marshal arts theme.  My first impression is that game play is so-so and not overly exciting.  It seems like a fancy game of poker, and ends up as a guessing game most of the time, especially for new players who don't know the decks.  I must admit that I have never found poker to be all that fun.  The cards seem somewhat durable but the artwork is fair at best.

Really great game. Improved upon by Yomi second edition, but pretty wonderful anyway.

Only complaint is the real game (a super tricky valuation game with bluffing) is somewhat opaque to new players, so a lot of people are turned off by what appears to be a luck/rock-paper-scissors thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Feels just like a fighting game and is very fun and strategic in out thinking your opponent. There is a little bit of luck, but that just makes it more interesting and fun. The only negative I can really see about this game is that: it only supports 2-players, has a few niggling rules, and is EXTREMELY expensive for what you get, but if you can deal with that it is superb.

Must have game that everyone should get (once the price goes down a bit). Definitely a very thematic and fun experience!

Update: After playing the game more, I feel like it has lost some of its initial flare that once captured me. Unless you play the game a ton (to know the decks inside and out), it becomes fairly luck driven. Even with knowing the decks it is mainly just about playing the odds. I've downgraded it to a 7 from an 8 and originally a 9. Just doesn't seem to hold up after a year or having it.

Update: More time has passed and the game just doesn't hold up in my eyes. I'm not a big 2 player only gamer and the game itself, while fun, just doesn't capture the same excitement. Down to a 6.5 (where it will probably stay). Definitely good if I'm in the mood, but otherwise not something I seek out.

Simple to learn, hard to master, yet the inherent unpredictability of RPS means that no battle is one sided. However, Sirlin himself admits that the game could be improved - save your $100 and wait for the 2nd edition. 

In fact, scratch that - [b]BattleCon[/b] has made both Yomi and Flash Duel obsolete. Sorry Yomi, but you're fired!

I like the concept better than the implementation. I'm just not all that fond of RPS, and most of Yomi is glorified RPS. There's also a large element of memorizing the cards in decks, which I find equally uninteresting. Kind of fun to play; People really overinflate the "depth" of this game. Yes, if you spend hundreds of hours playing and analyzing a game, you will see depth in it; that's apparently true of actual RPS as well. That doesn't actually make it a deeper game than the many games that you haven't bothered to spend hundreds of hours playing and analyzing.
I was originally thinking I'd pick this up if it were cheaper, but with more in-person plays I've changed my mind. Way too fiddly for what it is, with too many numbers and side rules. No feeling of theme with the characters. Lost Worlds accomplishes the same thing much better. Even DungeonQuest combat does the same thing in a funner way.

Feels exactly like a fighting video game, each character plays legitimately differently, and the learning curve is identical to that of said fighting game.  For a card that uses standard suits and values, there is almost no luck at all.  After 80+ plays, I've only had one or two times I've been unable to get cards I "need".  Superb game.  Just be careful when teaching newbs, because experienced players will school them EVERY time.

Well designed characters with unique abilities and strengths, yet somehow the majority of matchups in the game feel extremely fair.  Not a ton of memorization as far as your character's cards go, which lets me think about how I'm going to plan through the game and react to each combat situation from turn to turn, re-evaluating my hand and my opponents hand based on known information such as their tendancies, discard piles, etc.

RATING: 7
On the plus side, Yomi is an absolutely beautiful game, and there's definitely a certain elegance in its simplicity. But simplicity is also its Achilles' heel: After a lot of meaningless small moves, the game often boils down to who puts together the first successful big ace attack (which with some characters can do 45 points of damage). The artwork is great, the many different decks do provide a nice bit of variety (even if the basic deck construction isn't all that different from character to character) and the game can be taught fairly quickly. However, this is just rock-paper-scissors with chrome, and replay value does suffer a bit as a result. Some people are going to love this, and others will be more like me, seeing this as a good bit of fun for a short time but tiring of it in fairly short order.

This game can be a polarizing one, and it's depth is directly related to how many times you and your opponent have played the game, but it IS a brilliantly designed game that's oozing with theme.  Its core mechanic is as simple as rock-paper-scissors, but the randomness of that game (rps society aside...that comparison isn't a flattering one) is largely not present in Yomi.  A skilled player will always beat an unskilled one.

RATING: 7
Card-based simulation of a 1-on-1 video game fight. Basically advanced rock paper scissors. Simplicity can be good: the basic RPS approach really works here and makes for a quick and entertaining fight. I know there's some subtlety lurking in the different characters' differing optimal play styles, but I've only had access to 2 decks so far and can't really speak much to it. If you are interested in the theme, you'll probably like this; if not, you won't have a gaping hole in your life for skipping it. I personally fall somewhere in the middle.

Fantastic game!  As it's stated in some other reviews this is Street Fighter in card form (minus the Dragon Punch mashing, unless you're playing Jaina).  

Yomi: Fighting Card game tests your skills of reading your opponent and testing your skills at valuating the cards you have.  

A simple game of rock, paper, scissor becomes entrancing when adding in elements like combos, specials and supers.  Add in that each of the 10 characters (already balanced OUT OF THE BOX!) has unique abilities and play styles this game has me entranced.  

The only downside?  You need someone else to play it.  But then again, what game doesn't need that.  As long as I have someone to play, I will play this game.    

All in all, this game in my opinion is fantastic.  Easy to learn, difficult to master.  Your decisions affect the outcome of the game.  Can you get into the mind of the opponent?

Edit: Received my copy and am in LOVE!  The cards feel great.  The play mats that come with the Deluxe set are awesome.  This game is great!

I think this is going the same direction as all my fighting games: fun the first few times, and after that, you either want nothing to do with it ever again, or you get sucked in and think it's epically awesome what with the minor distinctions, learning your character...

Though I will point out you may as well just get a LCG at that point.

Might require some more play, but while it was fun, seemed like a guessing game to me. It's nice that all the characters play differently, though.

Okay, it sounds really dumb.  A card game based on a genre of video games where most players don't get beyond mashing buttons?  But it works.  The different characters are very cool and remarkably individual, and the art and component design are topnotch.  I haven't played an individualized prebuilt deck game this good since [gameid=9446], and that's saying something.  Definitely worth a try for anybody.

Hi! My boyfriend printed this game a week ago and we have been playing a lot. I don't play board games but he showed me this one and we are having a lot of fun :D. I really love the images, specially the panda (little ones are sooo cute) We are waiting for the box of the game to arrive. My boyfriend told me that if i enjoy the game so much I should create an account here and post a comment about it to support it, so here I am :)

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION. Now has 13 plays

How do I rate a game that is mechanically rock-paper-scissors, but where the gameplay involves psyching each other out on an intimate level? I think it's great, but it's strange too. The cards are annoying flimsy - boxes and cards damaged already :(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rock paper scissors on steroids and a great simulation of a fighting game without all the "just-frames". I need some more plays to learn the characters and fully appreciate their differences. Currently, it's fun just "button mashing".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game appears to be very random and dependent on what cards you have in hand, but I think that might be just the way it appears, and not how it actually is.  There's a strong thread of outguessing your opponent to the game, and I think that's the heart of it, but the cards in the decks seem to have a strong balance.  It's just a matter of knowing when to play a given card, and whether or not to combo.  There's something about the game that tickles my interest, though, as if there's something deeper to it that hasn't quite clicked yet, so I want to play this a bit more.  The last time I played a game that gave me that feeling, it was Race for the Galaxy.

Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).
\13\\13\
Yomi is the Japanese word for “reading,” as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.
\13\\13\
The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems "just random," you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.

I'm a huge fan of Puzzle Strike and Flash Duel, but I rarely have an opportunity for 1-on-1 gaming. If that changes, I'll hopefully be able to give this more time to shine.

I've taken a chance with some other small 2-player games, but this is too much of an investment for me. I could go for just a two-deck pack, but it would still require a significant amount of time on the part of another player to make my investment worthwhile. I still enjoy playing it every now and then on the [url=http://www.fantasystrike.com]Fantasy Strike site[/url], though.

No game IMO surpass the relation complexity/deep this game has. The game is very deep, but very easy to learn and teach.
Flavor and Art is top notch. Also extremely balanced for most standards.
Its a game that is deep, simple, easy to carry, exciting,  strong flavor, top materials, and takes little time to play. I dont know what else you can ask for a game.

I guess I don't understand the charm on this one.

It is basically advanced rock, paper, scissors. The art is amazing and the concept is solid - just can't get over the gameplay. It could have been more elegant OR more complex and I would be happier. Not that it doesn't have its complex moments using the cards effects or "bluffing" the jokers... but even those seem unintuitive and a little clunky making it hard to teach.

The fact that this is 2 player only is another reason I rarely get it out.

Aw, shucks.  I was all geared up for some stellar wordplay: [i][b]Yo-mi[/b] my money back, because this game sucks![/i]

Contrary to my sniggering hope, the game does fit the bill of brief, rowdy entertainment - even if players are destiny-bound to lay out whatever cards happen to surface.

Current rating is based on online play against the cpu. I *do* own a physical copy of the Complete 1st ED. So far, I think I'm in love with this game.  Rating may go up or down after several plays face to face against humans. Probably up.

Update. Yes my rating went up. What a FUN game!

A mind-game.  Hard to pick a main and stick with as there is so much variety and ways to play.

Tactical decisions made with devastating, often heartbreaking moments of knowing your opponent is prepping that big 45-point shot or will whittle you down with throws and blocks while his aura slurps out 2-4 health every turn.

Cool dueling card game. Each character have unique special powers as well as strengths and weaknesses. You need to pay attention to their stats to get an idea of how to attack/counter. There is definitely some luck but also some bluffing/strategy involved. Plays very quick at 10-30 minutes too.

'9' based on initial play of one character only.

Absolutely amazing simulation of a fighting game, with all its pros and cons. The sensation while playing mimics next to exactly how I feel when I play a fighting game. It's exactly the same kind of planning, outsmarting, and also, the same feeling of (probably perceived) imbalance and the feeling of "This is freaking impossible! That characters is just OP!" – which he/she probably isn't.

The complete first edition is quite costly at $100, but the gameplay is totally worth it. And the playmats you get aren't just flimsy paper things… they're thick, rubber mousepad quality. Very very well done.

A neat game that, for some reason, feels the need to beat you over the head constantly with the fact that YOU CAN PLAY POKER WITH THESE CARDS. Who gives a crap? That's like advertising that you can build log houses with the roads from Catan. Yes, you can, but this game's graphic design suffers because of it. Clean up the faces on the cards, drop the poker nonsense, and it will make the game easier to teach.

Okay, with that small rant out of the way, the game is very fun and plays quick as lightning. Kids as young as 11 will get it and have a great time with it. The different decks provide neat flavors and finding "your" fighter is part of the fun. As long as you go into it knowing that the game is very simple, you should have fun.

Own 8 of the 10 decks.

Easily the game I enjoy playing the most, currently (and I would assume I'll still enjoy playing for years to come). I even carry my complete set at work so I can play during breaks :)

The "Rock-Paper-Scissors"-like system will seem simplistic at first, but once you've played a couple games, you start realizing that it's really about the different match-ups and how your opponent plays (you observe patterns, get better at card valuation, and so on).

The game turned out to be much deeper than initially seemed, and I keep discovering new tactics and increasing my skills each day.

Excellent balance (the "worst" characters feel only at a slight disadvantage compared to the "best" ones, and that really is match-up dependent).

All in all, I couldn't be more satisfied with this game, and I'm even considering buying another copy of the First Edition Complete Set box (so that I can play mirror matches and do 2v2 or several games at once with my friends)! :D

Every time I play this game I walk away with some new rule of thumb. I love learning each matchup. It's like a different game every time. I also love how easy it is to teach to new people. Takes less than 5 minutes.

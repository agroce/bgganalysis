Actually I have a copy of the rules and bought an extra set of team cards while playing in the local club league.  Fairly realistic.  From Ebay for $32 on 01/12/09.  1985 Collector Editon #4216/5000.  Missing the 3 color dice.  Need to inventory the player cards.

The best baseball board game sim out there. This was the game that really cut through the problems that other games had to give a first rate baseball sim experience. Since they went out of biz, others have tweaked the game to add even more realism, but this is where it started.

Wonderful recreation of the sport of baseball to the table top!  From ball park effects, the importance of defense (range as well as error frequency) to the colorful cards that have their own "scouting report" on each card, there is a lot to like about the game.  3 percentile dice are used to start each at bat and the various charts utilized in the game as well as special ratings for some players really gives the game player a really good persepective of strengths as well as weaknesses.  There are also unique intangible ratings for some players and umpiring crews that make the game complete.  Best enjoyed by the sort of baseball fan that enjoys the finer points of the game where they control the strategies that are part of a real life game.  The bizarre play chart adds that certain element to the game where the unexpected can really change a teams or players fortunes!  I've been playing it since it first came out in 1994 and have never grown tired of playing it.  Like its predecessor, Pursue the Pennant, this is a well designed game that is entertaining to play and fun to play.  Highly recommended for those table top game players that like detail!

Back in my younger days, before computer baseball games caught up, Pursue the Pennant was my favorite baseball game.  Easy to play and quite realistic.  The high rating here is a reflection of my past; I don't think I could get into a game like this today.

The game that revolutionized Baseball simulations with the advent of Ball Park effects and all the subtle nuances that Baseball fans savor.  Surpassed only by it's sister game DYNASTY League Baseball (from the same designer as Pursue the Pennant) which is very similar to Pursue the Pennant, yet easier to play and more realistic.

From what I remember, it had fences you would put in the box for whatever ball park you were playing in.  Depending on how far a batter hit the ball based on the fence would determine if it was a homerun.

This rating is a "legacy" 10.  Pursue the Pennant was easily my absolute favorite game for five or six years from age 10 into my teen years - even though I just played solitaire games forever using just a couple of outdated all-star teams.  While I don't play it anymore (so I should give it a 6 according the BGG rating standards), it definitely earned its 10.

The board game is terrific. The problem with sorting through the charts goes away once you spend the time learning the system. It's incredibly realistic and statistically accurate. I played the '98 Braves season using the real-life starting line-ups, rosters, umpires, and weather conditions via baseball-reference.com. The variable were the relief, pitchers, pinch hitters, and defensive subs. I keep detailed stats. I was amazed at the end of the season how close the individual simulation stats came to the actual stats. With so many options in how you want to play the game,  you can enjoy playing the same team's season again with your own tweaks. I'm locked in now to using baseball-reference for every game. Very accurate. As to the complaints that the play results are 50/50 based, not really true.  Several variables including L/R pitching and batting match-up differences, clutch hitting, jam pitching, h&r options, etc.. In short, if you invest the time to get the flow of the game, the payoff is outstanding.

great looking baseball game that tried to rival Strat-o-Matic Baseball.
The problem with baseball boardgames is that in order to use pitcher fatique and rotations, you have to play more games than you really want to!  Stick to Strat-o-Matic Football or Hockey as far as team sports themed boardgames go.

RATING: 8
This felt like the best of the tabletop ballgames to me; I particularly liked the late 1980s editions with the square box and the stadium inserts.  But this felt like the best balance between complexity and simplicity for me, with easy-to-apprehend rules and clearly laid-out charts.  And of course, the Wild Play! chart, perhaps its single greatest addition.  J. Henry Waugh would be proud.

Not looking to trade this.  Offer would have to be very tempting.

Game can be played quickly (<10 minutes) once you have the charts memorized :).

Went on to morph into Dynasty League baseball.  A real travesty that the admin refuses to make Dynasty league baseball a separate entry.  The best baseball sim on the market, and I have tried most of them.  Love the ballpark ratins, multiple fielding ratings, umpire ratings, the lot.  It did lose something from ptp in field position and turning double plays, however.  Also, the fatigue system not as good as the old Statis Pro.  But overall, this is the champion.

A pretty good idea gone all wrong.

I played lots of card baseball games as a kid, solo and against family and friends. And I know what I like: fun, quick and accurate.

Heck, we are talking baseball here, a game designed by statisticians for statisticians (and people who sit around and drink beer and argue.)

Found this second hand and decided to give it a whirl, but lost steam after about 50 plays.

1.) So many calculations and variations to get to a simple result for one play.

2.) And so many charts, with wee print, to consult to get these simple results. Sometimes 3 or more charts have to be consulted.

3.) Not a lot of game player strategy. Just hit the button and roll the dice: presto, game.

4.) The stolen bases system does not work. I was aiming to break the modern single season team record before I canned it. I would have done it. BILLY BALL!

5.) All of the above makes the game too long to play; in some cases double the length of other comparable baseball games.

You know, when I compare this to other games I have played, I think:

There has to be an easier way.

Sure, the player range effects and park/homer effects and other clever bits were really neat.

But, I sort of got the feeling the game was playing me, not me playing it.

RATING: 7.5
Forerunner to Dynasty League Baseball, which improved the game.  At some point, BGG decided to remove the entry for Dynasty Baseball in lieu of this entry. Dynasty League Baseball may be the best baseball simulation not on a hard-drive. It doesn't have the support Strat-O-Matic has for older teams, but is trying to release older teams each year. As for realism, this beats Strat-O-Matic hands down.

Way back in the 80's and 90's, I played hundreds, if not thousands, of games of Pursue the Pennant. This was the ultimate baseball sim, kicking the pants off of games like APBA, Statis-Pro, and it's closest rival Strat-o-Matic. It had been about 15 years since I had played it, but I got a chance to play the updated version (now known as Dynasty Leaue) at the 2007 GoF (thanks Warren!) and it all came flooding back. Once you learn where the charts are, the game flows smoothly and can be played in under an hour. The results are amazing, too, with accurate ratings for all the players. I hope to find a few like-minded gamers to rekindle my love affair with this awesome game and start up a new league for the new millennium!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Maybe the ultimate in baseball realism, but not my bag, in the sense that I don't care, for example, to check to see how far a ball traveled and then cross-reference a ball park chart to see if it cleared the fence or was caught. Also, one of my lasting impressions of this game was the enormous amount of typographical errors that came with it. Traded.

Outstanding stat based baseball game. I feel the only drawback is that the dice provide too much randomness in trying to recreate a historical season.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Well, I dislike the 50/50 games (a la Strat-O-Matic), and this is one of those. I.e., either look at the batter's card or at the pitcher's card for the result. One doesn't affect the other. (Of course, there are controls on outlier statistics, so it's not entirely, exclusively 50/50.)

But the details in this game can make a game session come alive—you can see the events happening before your very eyes, or at least your mind's eye.

And sometimes the weaker player might outperform a stronger player, on any given play.

Oh, if only game flow was not constantly interrupted by calculation after calculation, all needed so that those details occur a statistically-accurate proportion of times and in believable situations (with believable outcomes). Rare for any given game to take less than an hour. Usually, I have to allot 1:15 not counting set up and "paperwork".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Perhaps the most complete baseball simulation of all time. Pursue the Pennant and its offspring, Dynasty League Baseball, are without a doubt the most statistically accurate baseball simulations ever created. One might argue with its number of available seasons compared to such stalwarts as Statis Pro, but the actual game itself is superior.

I still have a couple seasons of this stored in a closet somewhere.  I grew up playing Strat-o-matic and Statis Pro sports games and this was far and away the best baseball simulation board game ever created. It was really the first to separate fielding ratings into range, arm, and glove and had the most detail in every facet of the game without bogging down game play.

This game tells a more vivid story than similar sports sims with no more rules, making you feel the agony and the ecstasy more often as the subtleties of player ratings cause them to miss ground balls into the hole others would have gotten to, put homeruns over the fence by inches where others would have fallen short, avoid walking leadoff men instead of throwing ball four. Each player's card offers so many opportunities for analysis and managerial min-maxing--and that's even before the variety in umpiring crews,  regional weather and team chemistry. The components are predictably workmanlike, everything's quite fiddly, and little things like pitcher stamina don't quite match up to reality, but this game comes closer to getting it all right than any other I've played. Both the strategy and the storylines are here in spades.

Played in a league with twelve guys a few years ago.  The level of detail in this game/simulation (preparing defenses, umpiring crews, individual ballparks, etc) is amazing fun, but the effort required to play this game quickly means it is for purists only.  I don't mind the bookkeeping, that's baseball, but the constant cross-referencing of multiple charts to find results was maddening.  If the game wasn't sped up by the more experienced opponents I was in the league with, I would have thrown in the towel.  I also have a major issue with 50/50 split between pitcher/batter determining at-bat outcomes.  Individual vs Individual matchups are given no weight.

Were it not for the rebirth of the video game industry in the late 80's, this would have been THE game played by the intellectual baseball fan. Played all of the major baseball sims of the 80's, and this was the best of a great lot.

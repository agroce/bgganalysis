I think this game came about on a dare: how lame of a game can we make and still get people to buy it?
It has cards, chits, plastic and everything one would think would make fine Ameritrash, but it has the boring factor that would make a Euro proud.  If you own this, I'm sorry, and you're probably stuck with it, because it's HARD to trade.  I did, but I got lucky.  Don't expect much in return: definitely don't expect a cool game with dinosaurs.

RATING: 6
A classic adventure game based in the Warcraft universe. You basically travel to different locations of Azeroth and resolve encounters of diffferent difficulties. This way you level up, gather artifacts to aid you and resolve even more difficult encounters, and at the end you win the game. The game becomes a little bit boring after a few games as the map has only a few random elements so there are times when you replay the same events over and over. Also the design is not as streamlined as it should be, you have to reference the manual quite a few times during gameplay.

Long and tedious.

RATING: 7.5
Simplest RPG cum boardgame ever combined to a playable format. With a simple system for character upgrading, power enhancement, combat system and theme flavor, this game has it all.

The quick setup and eventual player interaction with (sort of) time count down to getting your valor points are a great plus.

Nevertheless, with multiple plays against similar enemies, the cards will be the limiting factor on replay ability. 

A very good basic fantasy game and a combat system, though slightly limited, is quick and reasonable for a fun filled game.

Bought from FLGS.  Normally I wait for more extensive review but this one may be playable with my kid eventhough he is only 8.  We played the first game and it took around 3.5 hr since we have to figure out a few things but it went fairly smooth even with some interruption from the toddler.
Now that we have played a 2nd game, it definitely shines better the the other WoW game.  The translation from Online to Board game is more sucessful since you are trying to build up your Levels (only 4 in here) and your gears.  The 8 vp to win can be accomplish by going after the major bosses(red level) or finishing the elite quest or even the Booty Bay run(turn in 3 of similar icon items).  The only problem I have is with the Hunter which seems too weak since you have to discard an animal encounter to flip.  This can be problematic if you keep encounting non-animal mob.  The balance between movement and energy was very well done, you end up with some tough choices.
My son had great fun playing the warrior which is probably good for beginner or young players.  PVP can be tough since it's only single round and you are not going to do enough damage unless you have multipliers via cards or the opponent was hobbling from previous encounters.  2nd play was down to about 2 to 2.5 hours.
We played it 2 more times at Conquest2008 and I narrowly won with the Warlock.

RATING: 6.5
Fun adventure game. I was a bit concerned at first because the board looked a lot like Arkham Horror, but it felt like it played a bit more like the game of Talisman I tried once. Fun, and I wouldn't mind playing again, but I won't seek it out.

RATING: 5
So.  What does this game do well?

1) The concept of the character deck, with increasing power as the character levels.  This deck adds a large amount of customization to an adventure board game.  Full Thumbs up.

2) player vs. player combat is encouraged, and character death, while not meaningless, is not a large setback.  Again, full thumbs up.

The bad:

Slow with four players, three of which are new.  But most games of this type are.  Not sure if this game is ultimately a strong member of the type, or simply a game with some strong mechanical ideas.

Played it with 2 and 3 players. There's not much interaction, if any, between the players, unless you really want to, even so probably the only reason to do so is because of 'quest cards' or trying to get a item from the opponent. But with 2 players the chances of the opponent having something you want aren't that many, besides he can always discard the items for potions, thus making the encounter less desirable.
With 2 players most of times it feels like a solitare game.
It's fun to go through the levels and all and probably it's a very good game, or at least a more dynamic game with more than 2 players. Can sometimes feel that it drags for longer than it should.

Corey tried to mix important aspects of different adventure games. Questing, looting, leveling up and PVP focus.

The mix is interesting but I have to find out if there is enough replayablity. The character development is not very deep and maybe killing off two generals is the most effective way to get valor points.

But I want to play the next game - and that`s not a bad thing...

RATING: 7
The biggest gripe about the game is it's game length. We played well over 4 hours with 4 players. Other than that, this is a very nicely streamlined version of those adventure games around (Talisman, Prophecy, Return of Heroes, Runebound etc.) and I would rate this a little bit higher than Runebound but less than Prophecy.

[i]Posted: 4/5/11, Rated: 6[/i]

We're big fans of [i][thing=17223]World of Warcraft: The Boardgame[/thing][/i], so I was excited when I picked up [i]The Adventure Game[/i] on sale.  Familiar character names, faces, and powers greeted us as we set it up.  We were a little disappointed in the number of classes present, but I would later discover that more were available as add-ons.

The first thing that felt wrong was the lack of faction enforcement: any character can travel to Undercity, not just Horde.  Furthermore, there really isn't any feeling of "development" in this game: you draw your ability cards, and you get what you get.  You don't choose to specialize in a specific "build," which makes your character's abilities predictable.

I am looking forward to exploring the other character classes, but I'm not sure that this game will ultimately have anywhere near the appeal of its larger sibling.

This game has beautiful components and a great presentation, it does a great job with the theme, so when I opened the box I just knew it had to be fun... but it's not.  Most of the locations don't mean anything unless you just happened to pull that location's card out of the deck, and character advancement is very shallow.  Worst of all, the game's endpoint is just a point value, eliminating any chance of this game feeling epic.

I really dig adventure style games and this one has proved its worth over the years.  The game is a successful hybrid between Talisman and Runebound...with it's own unique spices mixed in for good measure.  Each character plays different and the expansions are a must for variety.  A good use of the WoW license and a fun adventure game.  It doesn't topple Talisman, but it's a worthy alternative.

Just okay.  There are many better hack and slash, fantasy adventure games.  You have very little control over your equipment items (receiving them at random, even when you take a "market" action in a city to trade for equipment).  You could spend half of the game looking for armor that your character can wear.  Also, many of the quests are fairly difficult to accomplish so this game tends to take a long time to play.

SeerMagic says: Other games do it better, well done theme and lots of unique expansion characters to play, but the game is killed by random movement, random combat and random loot.

RATING: 6.5
After the first game, I'm quite happy with this game.  Despite it being described as lighter than Runebound, I find that this game has a lot more depth due to the abilities and the fact that you actually get a large amount of equipment as you play, which is quite unlike Runebound.  Tons of WoW flavour, and wonderful components like most FFG games.  I dropped my rating on Runebound after playing this.

This game also has less downtime than Runebound or Talisman.  You're not waiting for respawns in like Runebound or for someone, ANYONE to win in Talisman ;)

Now that Small World has grabbed ahold of us, I suspect that I'll have better luck convincing my sons to try other board games besides Pokemon.  This will be hitting the table soon!

RATING: 8
Very provisional rating - played with a couple of significant mistakes which slowed the game considerably. I'm guessing with the right rules this will be a good game, not exactly an 'adventure' game though - character development is rather limited, it's a race game and route to victory depends on the character (so you need to play one that suits your style).

** Update, got the expansion characters which helps with replayability. I don't get the hate for this. Maybe it's because I haven't played WoW that I like this one? It's not a traditional dungeon crawl adventure game for sure, it's a race to the vps game, approach it like that and it's great.

I want to like this game, but it's a little difficult to play. The text on the cards is really small, and I have to keep looking at the board to see where locations are. We never seem to get into a groove with this one, but I will give it another try in the future.

I went ahead and bought all the expansion characters, so I'll definitely be playing this again in the future, at least in a solo mode.

Beautiful bits, mini expands are cool. 
Very lucky at the start of the game, improves as your character builds up though. 
If you like theme, and a bit of a roll and move but with a bit more mechanics, then this is right up your alley. 
Still, my group is more interested in Power Grid and more Euro, less lucky games.

I like games like this, where the battle lasts only one round and the monsters have only one wound.

Kind of like a Talisman, except shorter and much better.  It's random in that when you visit spaces you draw monsters and attack them using dice.  But you can actually plan how you want to get your 8 vps.  Which spaces you need to visit, what powers you can use to help win you battles.

I think the game's rich theme helps hide the fact that there are a below-average number of decisions to be made.

It's fun to accumulate weapons/armor and other equipment...then level up...and accomplish your quests for VPs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players take turns, journeying their character through the lands, growing in strength and equipment, and completing quests for valour points.  Fairly standard fantasy/Talisman fare - obviously inspired by games like Return of the Heroes and Prophecy.  While Prophecy is still the best game, this one has some nice stuff, such as the level increases and ability decks, which get you more engaged with your character compared to other games.  Graphically, it looks good, but is a bit of a struggle with the tiny text and icons (Prophecy is excellent here).  Enjoyed my one game, played in around 3 hours.

Close to being a really great translation of WoW, and by extension really close to being a great game in its own right.  The biggest problem I can see is that it does such a great job, in lots of areas, in bringing the feel of WoW to a boardgame, that you notice the missing thing: that of co-op play, it's really the whole point of playing MMRPGs like WoW.
One day I will sit down and try to figure out rules for co-op play, I want to like this game more than I do at the moment.

Let me start by saying that if you are playing this game, chances are you are a fan of WoW.  I was hoping for a lore-heavy game that reminded me of my favorite quests and instances in Azeroth.  Instead, we got a game that dragged far too long and relied a bit too heavily on its players pointing to places on the board and talking about their experiences in WoW.  If all I wanted to do was talk to my guildmates about running Goldmines, I could have done that without paying 60 bucks for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I consider this game to be much better than the original WoW: The Board Game.  Things I like about it: shorter set up/put away time, quicker game play, and more player interaction.  Negatives:  a bit too random, longer than anticipated (could be due to being new to the game), and the game was designed for expansions.  This should have had Kalemdor & The Eastern Kingdoms on one map and more importantly this game should have had all nine character classes included.  The WoW design can still be improved upon, in my opinion.

Mercifully shorter than WoW:TBG but that's probably the only advantage WoW:TAG has. It's virtually repetitive multiplayer solitaire. Worse, the theme is practically invisible. You just feel like you're rolling dice to get stuff or moving around the board to fulfil certain objectives.

After reading [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/330755]troubadour's review[/url], I'd definitely like to try this!  Or is [gameid=8095] a better alternative?  WoW:TAG seems more gamey, and focused on player vs player combat (which doesn't really interest me)?  Arkham Horror seems like the best game in this genre, because of the cooperative element (which I prefer to player vs player), but this would still be fun to try some time.

Played at Gencon 08. I was really looking forward to playing it. in the end it was just a very dull collecting affair. You didnt gain power quickly enough and because you were rolling dice so infrequently there was no law of averages really and you offten got screwed over buy random encounters. Not worth the 2 hours it took to play.

I like it okay.  There's a lot to like, and a lot that will leave you lukewarm.  I love adventure games but I might finally be getting jaded.  

I enjoy that it plays relatively quickly.  I appreciate the lack of downtime.  I like the PvP-specific elements.  I don't like the one-off combat, how every monster has only 1 HP, and the movement system borders on completely abstract (I can't get right next to me from here?  What?)

Plus, I like rolling dice, but the movement dice frustrates me.  I appreciate that there's a balancing factor in energy given versus movement.  But it sucks to only want to move one space and have plenty of energy to spare to instead roll a 4 and get little else.  

This could almost benefit from a "choose your die face" system--pick the side you want.  However this would leave certain sides never used--I think it would be always full sprint, or lots of energy with little in between.

It's good for the price point, a decent entry into the adventure genre.  But it's not the "grail" of fast-playing adventure game I was hoping for.  I'm beginning to suspect that a fast-playing adventure game loses everything that makes adventure games fun in the first place.

For example, Runebound has random encounters enveloped by a general progression and eventual end boss battle.  In WoW, there is no requirement to follow a narrative, so it becomes just a series of random events.  

In my game, I defeated a big red board encounter for 4 VP.  I was still short.  My "glorious" quest ended camping out near a certain location on the board, killing some shmoes so I could get my three "kill dudes near this space" quest for the VERY anti-climactic finish.

Having read a lot of the promotional material, this seems very similar to Runebound. How similar is hard to nail down, given that Runebound is more of a system than a game, i.e. it can play very differently according to which expansion(s) you are using.

Great adventure game, even for me who knows almost nothing about the computer game.  The ability decks make the characters a lot of fun to play.  At first, I was put off by the computer characters being used for the encounter artwork, but I've gotten used to it.  The game can go long for your first game or two, but it moves along quickly if players plan where they are heading next.  Players can increase their level quickly if they focus on drawing ability cards.

We also play that you begin with 3 starter quests and can work on 3 quests at a time.

To me, this is a better game than Runebound, since the quests give you immediate objectives other than "wander around and beat up on baddies".

RATING: 5
Hmm, this is a tough one. This definitely has more personality and theme than Prophecy. It is more streamlined than Runebound and is more focused than Talisman. So compared to those, this is a pretty good game.

At the same time, the game still is a little slow, but maybe because this game just isn't my thing anymore. I can't really complain about any of the mechanics, it is very straightforward and I like the variety of characters.

Jul 08 - Fun Talisman-like game which is lighter than WoW:the Boardgame, but still a fair bit heavier than Talisman.  Each character has two quests to use for gaining VPs. Combat can be quite luck-driven and player killing is quite difficult so rarely worth the effort (read: Turns not doing other things).

I like adventure game in theory, because the evoke much of my imagination, but too often it doesn’t work as good as a game. There are generally three problems I have with them and it is lack of meaningful decisions, there is too much downtime and not enough interaction between the players. On a close look, this is what WoW: the adventure game wants to solve. The question is if it works? There is some interaction between the quests, where many involve player vs. player interaction and the first scenario in the [url=http://new.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=335]WoW: the adventure game league[/url] emphasize even more on that, but the board is large so you aren’t involved in each other if you don’t pass by or are very determined. There are some meaningful decisions, especially the use of ability cards and items, but there isn’t heavy thinking involved. The downtime isn’t a problem generally, since the turns go fast (if you or your opponent doesn’t have AP problems).

It is a game I want to like more than I maybe do. The problem I have had with it is the playing time. I’ve heard people have a reasonable playing time of this game and with that in mind; I will give this game a few more chances. The problem I have had is that I am not efficient enough during my turns in the game, resulting in more turns wasted and longer playing time.

A little better than I'd hoped. The mechanics and experience are exactly what you'd expect. It helps that my kid loves WoW (and that the flavor apparently works, though he said a lot of the stuff was "old.") I'd like it more if it was shorter. Add a point if you are a WoW fan (and don't bother if you are not).

RATING: 4
I prefer games where it is relevant where you move or what you decide to do. In this game it's more important how you roll the dice (what result they show). Leveling up your character means you have access to other areas on the map, not that you gain more power or abilites. The game's to repetitive and drags on for too long, so sorry no recommendation from my part for this.

Too long (three hours for new players) and too much downtime with four people.  Probably significantly better with just two or three.

Overly complicated version of the (already complicated) Runebound. This one has timing problems and weird rules that go against the logical.

Too many bits of cardboard too, but nice board and figures.

It's almost Auf Achse with a "fancy" WoW suit: roll, move, roll, move... 
Way too long to be any fun, and also too "complicated" -and I mean "complicated" in a bad way: lots of small -and unpractical- cards, many effects and details but no real choices, no real tension, no real game.
The only good idea is the double faced (monster/reward) card system... not much...
A very, very bad product.

RATING: 2.5
Yet another boring luck-driven adventure game with the same old and tired dice-rolling mechanics. It tries to be simpler and faster than similar games, but it still suffers from unnecessary elements (events, discovery tokens), and a significant amount of time is spent reading and re-reading lots of text, often in a tiny font. Interaction is of the take-that sort, and only serves to slow the game down. The artwork looks crude and rushed, while the graphic design of the board is just too abstract. The small size of the encounter cards is annoying, and even so, the board is cluttered by events. The characters seem unbalanced. The rulebook is the typical overly long and redundant FFG stuff. The only pro is the theme. I really like a good Fantasy theme about quests and monsters, but when will someone make a decent game around it?

RATING: 5
OK game in the dungeon crawler genre, but very little interaction.  The incentives to attack other characters are very low, and other than doing that and seeding some traps there is no interaction whatsoever.  Solitaire variant would be really really easy to do.  Plus, 95% of monster encounters are way too easy.  The 5% that are actually difficult are also aggro (meaning you can't move off of the monster to avoid it, like many monsters), which is obnoxious.  The characters, classes, leveling, equipment, and battle mechanics are solid.  The leveling is interesting because it unlocks different areas of the board, which feels very much like a video game.  The character-specific decks of cards add a lot of flavor and difference to the characters.  The whole complete a quest get VP thing worked well, with several different paths to victory.  Some people concentrated more on quests to obtain VPs while others leveled up their characters to fight boss monsters for VPs.  Those two paths seemed fairly balanced.  The downtime was kinda bad, but would improve if you knew the game and the cards.  

The game really felt like a video game, with boss battles, different parts of the board opening up depending on what level your character was, and the mindless combat aspects, where little actual decision making occured but you felt like you were doing something.  Overall, a decent game I would play if asked but not something I would ask for.

Fun and pretty streamlined adventure game in the World of Warcraft. Thumbs up for huge ammount of player interaction and for the different character decks that make playing different characters a different gaming experience. Can be played with 2 players, but the player versus player combat aspects of the game really demand more players for it to truly shine. Also takes only around two hours to play, and compared to, say, runebound, that's pretty fast for an adventure game.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (August 2016)

World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game was my oldest unplayed game. I bought it on August 2011, so it took me over 5 years to play it :D. My desire to play it was low because a friend said to me that it was a very Talisman like game and I don’t enjoy Talisman very much (he was right by the way, gameplay has many similarities to Talisman). I also bought all the expansions for the game. I wasn’t disappointed because I wasn’t expecting much from it.

The theme is great as I really like the source material.
 
World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game´s rules are pretty easy to teach. You can do it under 18 minutes. The art of the game is very good as are the components and miniatures. It takes more than 2 hours to finish a game (way too long for what it offers).

The gameplay is very simple, I’m amazed that a lot of fellow geeks voted it to be a medium weight game (it currently has a  2.55 weight rating). To me, the game is rather simple with obvious choices every turn. 

The level system is color coded and it looks great on paper, but advancing to the next level is very easy to accomplish so it left me unsatisfied.

It is too slow with four players, I prefer to play it with 3 players or the downtime is too much for me. It has low player interaction (which I don’t mind, but some people can be bothered by this).

There is lots and lots of uncontrollable luck (roll to move, the missions are random, some are much more easy then the others and they can appear geographically close or far from you, the player´s cards, the equipment cards, roll to combat), if you get a good weapon you can advance much more quickly than your opponents. A player can run away with victory due to luck and there is nothing you can do to stop him.

Bottom line, World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game can be a fun game to play from time to time. However, it isn’t my cup of tea, it is way too simple and basic for my current tastes and these days I no longer enjoy most Ameritrash games. I will sell it ASAP.

Current Rating: 4.0

I certainly like it better than [gameid=17223].  It has more of a feel of [gameid=714], [gameid=21523] or [gameid=8095], than it does [gameid=17223], though.  In that regard, I think it's OK, better than any of those other ones.  But after only 2 plays, I'm still not sure how much I like it.

And after 3 plays (2 @ 4-player, 1 @ 2-player) I am sure -- it's a mediocre game.  It has better mechanisms than Talisman, IMHO, but like Runebound, it takes forever to get around the board, and like [gameid=8170], the quests lack any flavor.  Prophecy I only played once or twice, and I only vaguely remember its mechanisms.

I didn't feel any sense of progressing my character at all during any of the games.  The stat increases are marginal at best, and the item differences between the various colors seemed marginal as well.  At the end of the game, my ability cards (which I'd had all game) were still better than most of the items I'd seen, cumulatively over all of the games played.  And the end of the game is very anti-climatic.  Roll one die, hit once, survive the challenge, get the card - *poof* you win.

So, in the end, too long for what it is, too dry and just plain 'meh'.

RATING: 5.5
Seems to me to be better than Runebound on every level.  MUCH quicker, more variety, more character 'development', more genuine decisions, more player interaction (via certain quests).  No great slabs of pointless text on cards (the cards ARE too small though - this is a Fantasy Flight games problem in general).  The character decks are very good.  The penalty for dying is not harsh at all - that's a good thing.

After repeated plays, I'm finding there is much more to this game than apparent at first. It is best played as a competitive action game instead of a multiplayer/solitaire adventure. Level up and get Valor Points fast (Booty Bay, Overlord Trophies), get in the face of your opponents and slow them down with Discovery Tokens, and don't linger around the board looking for loot.

Only played once with three players. I liked the ability deck and thought that was cool but the game play was just kind of flat. Wasn't bad, I'd play again but wasn't great either.

Compared to the WoW Boardgame, this is significant more playable. Rules are simpler and gameplay is quicker. Less tokens to manage as well. In summary this is a WoW-themed Talisman game.

Unfortunately its not perfect. My main dislike was that there was too much text to read and the font was too small. The variety of cards did add flavor to the game, but at the cost of having the players read lots of text. Also, there was some ambiguity with words like enemy, opponent, character etc...

The game was a bit draggy with players losing interest towards the end. Too many cards and events and quests to keep track off. Also, the discovery tokens did not work well, since almost all players just avoided it. It ended up being more of a distraction when playing.

Utterly unimpressed.
I am a HUGE fan of adventure games...length, randomness, etc that are usually complained about in this genre, do NOT bother me.
Even with that said...this game fell flat.
It has some to do with its set of rules, options,e tc. and some to do with the fact that I would MUCH rather play many of the other games in said genre.

************************************************
After a time away, have decided to give another chance.  Could have been a bad experience on my first 2 plays due to many other factors...
Original rating a 3...will update A.S.A.P.

It's basically as mundane as I originally thought.  If you are a fan of the MMO, then this'll offer more enjoyment, as the encounters, places, classes, etc will please you...obviously.  If you are simply an adventure game fan, there are many better options for adventuring:  Runebound for sure...heck, Talisman even!

It's like a less exciting version of the dungeoncrawl board games I played when I was 11. The really toxic thing is how long you wait before turns so that you can (a) roll, then (b) move, then IF YOU ARE LUCKY (c) heal/gain a card/do something else that doesn't move you forward much.

It's really not very good.

In the simplest sense, this game is a more complicated, a bit less random version of Talisman, set on the continent of Azeroth.  

There are a lot of features that make it different, however.  The combat is a bit more complicated, as characters have both attack and armor values, but it is still resolved with only 2 die rolls.  However, there are a few other things involved, like damage, special abilities, leveling, etc.  The biggest difference is the ability cards.

There are only 4 characters at the present (with 4 more coming).  Each one has an ability deck, with cards attempting to replicate the standard class abilities of the WoW game.  For example, with the orc fury warrior I played the first game, I had ability cards like charge, intercept, heroic strike, charge, etc.  Playing one of these cards gives you some sort of bonus, but are usually done once played.  You draw more ability cards throughout the game.  In this way, it gave me flashes of Red Dragon Inn.

You also get quests, many of which are PvP based, which is cool, as they encourage interaction.  Each quest is worth so many points, and the first person with 8 points is the winner.  While this can be anti-climatic if you aren't paying attention, people are reporting that it can be quite intense, as you race to get your last few points, while trying to prevent your opponents from doing the same.

I have two quips with this game.  As with Anima, I felt that there perhaps weren't enough cards, and that we will see a lot of repreats until the character packs come out (they are packed with 28 encounter cards each).  I also thought there were too many straight up combat cards, with only like a half dozen so in each encounter deck that did anything else.  One of the beauties of Talisman to me is that you never knew quite what you were going to get (in WoW you're going to draw a monster probaby 9 out of 10 times).

The other is more difficult to define.  I felt some real slowdown after the first half-hour or so.  Maybe this will change as my strategies improve.

So think of this as a less-random, slightly more strategic version of Talisman.

Playing with a solo variant. I'm going to tinker with it to require some VP (not sure of the level yet) and defeating only one overlord. Will keep the timer of the overlord moving toward the nearest city at the end of each turn if its number is rolled (will use a d4). There's much less here than Runebound, but that means it's lighter too. Just need to get a better balance of a shorter game/increased tension while still getting the added interest of playing with quests. I don't like that the quests are gone from the solo variant I was using. I also don't want the difficulty to come from having to defeat all 4 overlords. That's too repetitive - hence wanting to add a VP goal as well.

As a former WoW player who spent many hours playing the game when I had more disposable hours :-P , and not liking the direction that the computer game has been taking since about WotLK, I find this game to be an awesome trip down nostalgia lane, all of the cards reference vanilla WoW items and quests, and a lot of the references would be totally lost to anyone who came into the computer game late in its life (post-cataclysm after all the low-end content was changed). There are probably better games in the genre for anyone who didn't play WoW 1.0-2.0.

For me a big part of this game is the memory of having seen the content online whenever I draw a card.

The game is very cool further to that I'm a fan of World of Warcraft. The art and theme are very faithful to the World of Warcraft. The miniatures of the game are beautiful, as well as cards and more cool is that it has the version in Portuguese. The interesting thing is that you can play the game cooperatively, there are  unofficial rules available on the internet to do so. The game is for 4 players, but I have bought 2 characters expansions (American version) and now it can be played by 6 players! Porttuguese version is so rare to find!

RATING: 7
Seems good... but will need more play to better internalize the mecanism. It seems to be a bit repetitive since you fight a creature each turn. But at least the combat are quick. It is difficult to overlook a space in board since there is text/icons everywhere.

I really like the personalize character deck. This is what gives each character its personality.

The PvP is good and its nice to have as much incentive to fight each other.

It's a shame that the 2 key mechanims: quest and character levelling are not well integrated together.

[Update]Games are a bit long. My fellow Players had difficulty focusing on filling up quest. It seems it is more interesting to only kill monsters :) For me, it is a proof that the quests mecanism for winning is to "distinct" from the levelling mecanism. I think Character progression and Victory condition should be more linked.

I was the only one of four players who liked it after the first game - accordingly I'm not sure how soon I'll manage to add a second one. Not sure what bugged the others, but possibly it's because we played for 3+ hours, which seemed overly long.

There are a couple of fresh ideas in here that may be a bit confusing for new players. It's not a question of playing with the wrong rules, but with the wrong strategy, and a lack of experience increases both the number of rounds you'll play and how long each of those rounds will last. Therefore I'd recommend to play with only three or, optimally, two players when starting with this.

Played twice.

I've never played World of Warcraft the MMORPG. But I did play the older Warcraft real time strategy games on the PC. So I bought the core set and the 8 character expansions for World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game. My regular group of strategy board game players enjoy this game, but not as much as some of the other Fantasy Flight Games that are out there. It doesn't seem to have the same player interaction as other games offer, and there can be quite a lot of downtime between turns. I still feel it was a worthwhile investment.

At first I was worried this would just be Runebound set in the World of Warcraft. It turned out to be a completely different game. It's much more competitive and more 'to the point' than Runebound.

Well. It is a kind of an advanced Runebound. But the 90min for 4 players is a joke. The time it tooks with 4 players is more like 3h+. And the game itself. Not bad. Actually very solid light RPG which has a couple big problems though: a) It is WAY too easy.  After a couple of rounds it is virtually impossible to die at monster combats. b) Movement around the board is surprisingly slow lenghtening the game time more than it should. c) player-vs-player combat is unextiting and rarely does offer any "prizes" enough for to go for it.
I would not play this with 4 players (too much downtime)

a real disappointment. 

**********************

i found it fairly uninteresting.  having played WoW the pc game, enjoyed previous pc games set in the WoW universe, liked the WoW boardgame... maybe my bar was a bit high.  that said, even if it was set in a different universe, or the George RR Martin universe that FFG has talked about doing, I doubt it would change my opinion.  

the cards/quests/characters that come in the base game seemed pretty limited at the outset and i did not see much replayability and lots of the stuff seemed pretty repetitive.  it does have a pretty good pvp system, but pvp is required for a decent amount of quests.  i like to play games like this solo, but there were too many hurdles it seemed to overcome to make it work (i think there is now a solo variant, but i have not tried it).  

i think my main problem with the game is that there are other games that do what it does better and i do not like the way FFG is doing expansions for the game (although, i am probably biased as i think they really shoehorned the game into the universe).   i think prophecy is a better competitive multiplayer game.  runebound has a better solo game (and i like the way FFG does the expansions), WoW the boardgame is a better solo/co-op game and a way better use of the license/universe (and the combat system is cool and definitely unique).

Played this once, and the end is just the end. After the game it was just over and I felt 'ok it's over?'. I was thinking about the game afterwards and I think it has a couple problems:

 * there isn't a lot of character development - even though you have a bunch of events, your character doesn't change much from the beginning to the end of the game. with "success" numbers for the encounters ranging from ~5-10, that's not a big range (especially considering your range likely starts from ~1-7).
 * there aren't any options when you level up - it would be nice to choose which spells to upgrade or what new spells to gain to add to your ability deck. (I played the priest and was sad to learn after we started that the only option was a PVP shadow spec. If you know me; you know that's absolutely 180 degrees from my personality)
 * there aren't that many items that you are actually interested in keeping. in the course of the game; i only put on 4 items.

being a game called world of warcraft; i expected to be trying to make my character stronger and getting cool new stuff over the course of the game. alas, that's not really how it plays out.

Surprisingly WoW mixed with Talisman doesn't really work all that well. Partially because the map is a lot more restrictive in comparison. Also, the effects of leveling up and using ability cards are not nearly as interesting. Worst of all, getting anywhere usually takes a couple of turns. The one rule that puts this game above Talisman, in my opinion, is that you can move less than what you roll on the movement die, but this isn't enough to save the game for me. Even though it's far longer and more involved, I prefer the World of Warcraft Board Game by a mile.

RATING: 6
Get some quests (typically kill things or collect and deliver things) and then roam around the board killing things or delivering things until you've made 8 quest points. The board is restricted by the 4 colour levels, but levelling up to get access to the next area is done relatively easily by beating something at a specific location, and then there's the normal bigger monsters, better items, higher scoring quests. There are things to like: the theme is great (the map closely matches WoW), turns go fast and are evenly paced, and the combat system is as clean and fast as you could hope for. On the downside, there can be periods of slow progression if you get stuck with some low movement rolls and difficult aggro monsters (must stay until beaten). The pace is slow to begin with as players come to grips with their ability cards. Familiarity will improve this, but perhaps be offset by paying more attention to what other characters are doing and have collected - there is the option to whack 'em and steal an item, which is about the limit of interactivity in the game. That and throwing a curse ability card at someone. I don't mind low interactivity (it's an upside for me here), but it may be a negative for many who enjoy the "wander about" genre. Decisions are straightforward through the game and there's not a lot of tension. You're playing this for the ride. And for a ride game, I thought it was pretty decent with things to recommend it.

Another fantasy-rpg-boardgame similar to Runebound, Prophecy, Return of the Heroes etc.

Characteristics are: not much character-development, just four different characters (though expansions will add more), printing too small, various quests, easy to learn, plays relative fast (max. 90-120 min in our experience) for this kind of game, no downtime, player interaction, forgiving (no harsh death penalty, tweakable), a lot of WoW flavor. Well, I like it, but it gets a little repetetive because each turn the same happens - like in most games in the same order: move fight (roll dice).

Bought this as I was looking for a game in the Return of the Heroes vein. Something rather light, with a reasonable playing time and with some serious player interaction  (which RotH seriously lacked).

First and second play impression: 

Kinda fun. It feels like a very random but fun romp through WoW-land for nights when you're in a fantasy mood but don't have the time or mental endurance for rpg-ing or Descent. 

The cards are on the smallish side and a  player mat would have been nice for organizational purposes. Some frustrating typos, but nothing serious. The playing time is a bit on the long side but ok. There's a lot of screwage (but rather that than multisoli - at least in this type of game). 

I'm not a WoW-player so it's kind of disappointing that the monster illustrations are screen captures. 

Will not be getting frequent table time, but will definitely be pulled out every now and then when the mood is right.

Update: The solo-variant is really nice!

I was quite lukewarm after reading all BGG opinions and comments. But once I've read all the rules and played the game - oh wow! What a superb experience. I was (and other players too) a long time WoW player and this games serves nicely as a nostalgia trigger. It's very very well designed and it mimics certain aspects of the game in a way that feels very "at home" for wow players. Other things just fit incorporated as board versions, as obviously they couldn't work otherwise. It is very visible that a lot of live and care went into making the game. We were just amazed at seeing familiar monsters, items and locations. I thought that the game would be pretty dumb, talisman like, but it wasn't. There is just enough decision making and sometimes these choices are pretty hard. I love all the ability decks with interesting mechanics, familiar icons and names. I was really impressed how will video game concepts got translated into a board game. Some events are also very interesting, evading the standard game framework and doing something new. There is quite a lot player interaction and really feels like a fun PvP.

Don't listen to nay-sayers. This game is very cool. I wa quite surprised that it is, because I'm in general very picky about board games. But this one is a hit! Do keep in mind that I played with all the expansions. It's so sad there won't be more.

FFG succeeded in making an adventure game that "fixes" most of the issues with its other titles "Runebound" and "Talisman" (now an FFG title anyway!). Unlike Runebound, player interaction is a significant part of the game and downtime is minimal. Combat is simplified, but not so much as in Talisman (darn close though!).  What really sets it apart is that each character has a deck of action cards that represents the special abilities of that character.  Managing your ability deck is key to winning and adds a whole new element to the game.  What's missing is the strong narrative that is found in Runebound and to a lesser extent in Talsiman.  This has led many to complain about the repetitiveness and "sameness" of the encounters.  However, defeating encounters is not the goal of the game...they are there to provide a distraction to your real goal of completing quests.

Gosh. By the halfway stage of the game, I was pretty sure that I was going to win, and even more sure that I didn't want to play through the next hour just to prove myself right.

If you're twelve years old, and want a less boring, less flawed, more directed version of Taliman, this game is for you.  But ultimately it has most of the hallmarks of Talisman - random encounters that just don't feel particularly interesting after the first couple, interesting-sounding locations that prove to be the same as every other location, items that look exciting but ultimately just make things fiddly, and overall give the feeling of a dice-based snoozefest for anyone other than the most ardent Warcraft fanatic.

So unless you are twelve and a Talisman fan, I'd suggest steering clear.  I certainly have no desire to play it again.

The mechanics are beautifully streamlined, and once you realise that you should be going as fast as you can to go up levels as quickly as possible it can get really tense and fun. Having a few expansion characters to pick from really helps to keep it varied and interesting.

If you are going to play this game, do NOT dally in the low levels of the game. I now head for a levelling location from my very first turn - if it works out, you really put your opponents on the back foot.

Good mechanics, feels much like Runebound in some ways.

However, I have no clue how anyone could finish a game in 90 minutes (with 4 players, at least).  It's very long.

--Aug2008-- Quite an appealing adventure crawl.  After one play, there are parts of the mechanics that are very nice:  the levelling up is cool; the map-restricted-by-level is amusing; the quests are great.
 Yet it seems there's only one path to character improvement:  defeating encounters.  And when one's character doesn't do much defeating early on, it's a hard hole to climb out of.  I think I appreciate the Prophecy mechanism where advancement can be done by slower (and more certain) means as well.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit more than I did the larger, more epic, WoW game from FFG...  I found that one to be a pretty horrible dice fest.

This game does stream line the experience, but I felt rather constricted by the static nature of what you are, where you go, and how you get there.  While the game does mimic the MMORpg in general ways, I did find my self wishing it had a bit more of a runebound feel  (ability to go anywhere, or take on challenges that were more difficult.)

It also felt like the 2 non-magic characters were far superior and range combat is FAR superior to (more prevalent) melee.    Which leads to my next problem"  combat only lasting one round...  this made it difficult to do anything but hamper the opposing players; what, with rampant healing potions on the board...  (try killing a character sitting on a double heal)

Over all an ok game that I look forward to trying again (especially with new character decks) but I think this one is going to fade rather quickly outside of WoW junkies.

RATING: 7
Fun game, similar to Runebound, but it has the WoW theme. Also, it has a much simpler combat system than Runebound. However, there is a small selection of characters to choose from, and they are not customizable at all. Leveling up consists of switching to a different color-coded character sheet that has a slight difference of stats from the lower levels. Some higher levels are improvements while others are not. For better customization, check out World of Warcraft The Board Game. It is a much longer game, but there are a lot more choices and features. Too bad that  both this game and WoW:TBG is now out of print.

Also played a couple of solo games against the fan variant doomtrack. The game has some fun stuff going on in it but I'm not real anxious to play it again, especially not with less than 3.

This game captures the grind aspect of a MMO or action RPG perfectly.  However, the grind really annoys me in those games.  Combat is on a simple die roll, so luck can be cruel.  In the one game we played, my wife won with eight points ..  .I had 1.  I did like the leveling up and the hope of getting good loot was always fun (except it always failed for me).  I would play again, but the first play left much to be desired.

Feels like a combination of WizWar (in that you get cards and play them to make boom-booms) and the old TSR Dungeon (move down hallways, fight monsters, take stuff.)

Sigh. There's a lot I really, really like about this. I like the simple skill system, the map setup with fixed locations to level up. However, the pace is horribly slow. It takes a long time to travel anywhere. Many quests just aren't worthwhile. The warrior getting pvp quests is very overpowered and annoying. The game drags horribly. I'd always heard it was about a 45 minute game; at that length, it would be awesome. At 2 1/2 hours, it just doesn't work.

Runebound Lite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Bumped into it at Essen 2013 for cheap bundle pack (this + all 8 character expansions).

As the main drawback of the main game was the limited replay value with just 4 characters, having all the character packs is bound to alleviate that problem.

Could be the multiplayer Runebound alternative I'm looking for. As Runebound, while being a great game, is only suitable for 2 players imho.

[EDIT MAR 2014] Finally played this one and felt ho-hum about it. It is not a bad game per se, but it suffers from numerous flaws that in my opinion make it markedly worse as Runebound or even Relic:

- it has no overarching goal. It just progresses until someones hit the 8VP and then the game is over. Runebound and Relic both have scenario based ending conditions.
- Theme means a great deal to such games, and the theme of this one didn't suck me in as much as the Terrinoth or 40K universe. Might be different for WoW players of course.
- 'Progression' means 'getting out of your little corner' instead of 'becoming a bigger MF'. I want these games let me make the decision whether to venture to dangerous grounds with my puny equipment (possibly getting severely burned in the process). I like these games to be brutal in some sense, WoW:TAG is too 'soft' in that sense for me. In Runebound as well as Relic, you start feeling powerful. Here you start feeling 'less restricted'.
- As an extension to this: getting killed is hardly a setback. Asides from characters that have trouble flipping their character card to their (more powerful) backside, there is virtually no disadvantage by getting killed. You get back to your home city, heal all damage, flip to starting side and lose any attached cards (of which there is only one usually). Compare this to Runebound (you lose your most powerful item) and even being vanquished in Relic (lose all power cards, trophies, influence and getting knocked to outer tier): in both cases, while it is not your definitive ending, you simply really want to avoid it. Which brings more tension to the battles. Too many battles in WoW:TAG simply lack any tension beyond "what will I get as reward".
- Map is garish. As is the map of Relic, however that is at least pretty to look at. This one is not. The Runebound map feels about right.
- A LOT of the game focuses on PvP and this is something that I personally don't seek in such games. If you like PvP, this game might actually be better for you than Runebound and Relic. However, apart from PvP, it bears the same 'multiplayer solitaire' feeling, which means your involvement in the game needs to come from theme and immersion, a factor in which WoW:TAG, for me, is decidedly worse than the other two.
- Finally, you are hit with '4 times random':
1. Random quests.
2. Random movement + energy at start of your turn (energy pretty much determining your battle options for the turn)
3. Random ability card draws.
4. Random encounter (and hence, item) draws.
Of these randomness, the clincher is the second one. The first one, random quests, is in the nature of a quest-driven game and they are varied and fun. Also, there is a mechanism in WoW:TAG to cycle unwanted quests, so there is a strategic component to mitigate the randomness. The last one, random encounters, is in the nature of the game and this randomness has been mitigated by color, as in Runebound. Relic is a bit worse in that aspect but both Runebound as Relic don't have aggro (sticky) monsters which force you to defeat them or get killed. So the problem is actually bigger in WoW:TAG.

Finally, Random ability card draws can be mitigated by getting and spending a lot. This is akin to Power cards in Relic, and it works. However, in Relic you can always spend your power cards to substitute dice rolls, whereas in WoW:TAG you need energy to use them... and that energy comes from a completely random dice roll. 

For me, that is the final clincher why this game will never get any playtime above the other two. If I do seek a 'light' adventure game, I'll play Relic. If I do seek a more involved adventure game, I'll play Runebound. And if I want to go all out with theme and don't mind some brain taxation, I'll break out Arkham Horror.

That all being said, WoW:TAG is not a bad game. It has discovery tiles, which is a very nice mechanic (which should've been in Relic), it has class tied weapon/item upgrades (which it shares with its bigger brother WoW:The Boardgame) which gives a very good thematic class feeling, it has interesting quests (more interesting than Relic at least), it has interesting weapons/items/potions etc (Robotic Goblin Chicken anyone) which are more involved than the generic items of Runebound or even Relic (though the last are themed pretty good).

In short, if you are fond of the WoW universe, like Player vs Player combat in your game, and don't want too many strategic choices on your turn, this might be the adventure game for you.

If however, you dislike PvP, want more than only tactical choices and don't mind the WoW universe, there are better adventure games out there. Even with all eight expansions included.

It's not a bad game, just... tepid.  But a tepid game might as well be an actively bad one because why spend time learning and playing games that are less than good?

In the positive column, it's easy to play and teach, turns are incredibly quick, and combat is simple and to the point. I also like the way that more difficult areas of the map are only made accessible once the player has upgraded to the requisite level.

What makes it tepid, though, is there's no distinctiveness to anything you do: every combat feels the same, every location feels the same, every quest feels the same, every character level feels the same, every event feels the same, every item feels the same... This dry, static vibe prevents the game from developing into something fun or dramatic.  Players just go through the motions over the course of dozens of turns.  It feels quite procedural.

I would play it again a time or two but I can see it having a very short lifespan before I'm done with it completely.

Maybe we were missing the point and there should have been a lot more "take that" / "PvP", but it seemed both hard to die and long-winded to progress.

I dunno...it just takes too long for what it is.  if you could cut down the number of turns it takes to get to the end (faster progression) this game would probably get more play.

Prefer Runebound, but this has potential to increase the rating if more plays stream line the game length.

With three players, I liked this game better than I thought I would. Of course, I expected something similar to Talisman, so I was prepared for a lot of randomness and a long playing time. Compared to Talisman and Return Of The Heroes, Warcraft unfortunately has less narrative, making it less atmospheric. On top of that, the amount of item & skill management required is quite staggering - do not play this game with someone who dislikes to read a lot of text in a very tiny font. A big plus for this game is that it offers a lot of ways to improve your chances for victory and survival. And if you should die, you do not have to start all over again (like in similar games). The biggest plus for this game, however, is that you can collect quest points on any level, almost anywhere on the board, making it impossible to win "kamikaze style". All in all I think it is an entertaining game for an uneventful Sunday afternoon, as long as all players are bent on playing quickly.

Interesting game. It's definitely got the Runebound feel but it plays the theme and feel of WoW so good that it is a different game. Slow build up at first but is quick enough people are involved all along.

***UPDATE***
Dropped the rating down a bit. Its an adventure game for sure. The problem is that it gets a bit long for what it is.

It's light and it's fun, and it is really worth playing the timed version. 

Agree for a certain duration, set a clock and put it out of sight. When it sounds, finish the round. Overlords are only worth 3 points in this variant. 

I will update on the Warsong Gulch Variant when I tried it.

As a recovering WOW addict finding a second hand copy of this in my FLGS for £15 seemed too good an opportunity to miss.  Things got even better when I found out it also included 6 of the expansion characters.

However, it seems the guy in the shop knows more than I do, which is why this was priced at £15.  Not a great game, the only saving grace is that all the locations, mobs and items will be familar to WOWheads.

One group play, and one solo play under my belt. The quests seem dry and abstract, the character management and differentiation is very low, and mostly this just feels like yet-another-questing-game. I much prefer the character building in the older and more complex sibling  game, [gameid=17223]. There's plenty of luck in the combat here, and the turns get very repetitive, very quickly. The decisions are very rare. It's like grinding in the online game, only you never get to do anything else. The [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/333540/solitary-rules]solo game[/url] is better than the regular game, but not enough to save it. Definitely a pass on this one, unless you absolutely love the franchise and can't find the other, fuller game.

I like the game but not having a solo variant hurts the replayability as it is not a game for everyone. Even a 2 player game is going to take near 2 hours unless both players are very familiar with the cards and rules. I like the theme better than Runebound but util they work the kinks out of it (rules and timing issues) and add more content to it I have to rate it slightly lower.

In general, [b][i]World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game [/i][/b]was enjoyable for the first couple of plays, then someone took the big character and raced to a win in very few turns by avoiding everyone else and doing his own thing. I suppose we could have messed with him, but it takes time to get around – and we'd all have to sacrifice or else one player would be punishing himself while the others prospered.

After reading the rules I'm wondering if this just shouldn't have been another expansion for Runebound. There seem to be many similarities only Runebound has a much richer world of adventure to offer with its card and board expansions.  I like the comments that it plays quicker and has more interaction.  Maybe the game is closer to Prophecy than Runebound.  They've just announced the expansion characters that will add life and replay value to the game.  I suspect they will support it with further larger expansions such as new boards and quests.  With those, the potential is there for my rating to go up.

An enjoyable fantasy adventure game.  Shorter than Runebound, etc., so it has a place in the collection.  But, realize that, like most of the others of this genre, it is highly dependent on what cards you get.

My main problem whit this game is that the warrior at least blows through the early game without having to stop since the penalty for dying is non existent. What is the point of having monsters do damage if you are healed of all damage before they even can hurt you cumulatively.

I enjoy it, but I realize for the game to work, several people must be playing, which is a bad idea when teaching the game.  Instead, play it with a group who have a few plays under their belts.

Miles better than Talisman, but not as good as Return of the Heroes.  

I'm just pleased to find another adventure-fest that I can play with my kids.  In fact, I would say that this game is strictly for kids or families.  There's not much there for a group solely consisting of adults.

Either way, I'm wondering whether the static board spaces may get tiresome after a while.

A semi-tactical game that bades players use logistics to their advantage then requires they roll a die to see how many movement points they get per turn, which is problematic, to say the least. Moving less gives you more energy, but both are desirable at different times and you can't control what you roll at any given time. Ditto for combat, which can become tedious if you're ambushed by a monster that doesn't let up ("aggro") when you need a 5 or 6 to defeat it, literally forcing you spend entire turns in the same spot treading water. The player interaction thing is severely overplayed - it just doesn't happen - so often times spells that say "use on an enemy within X spaces" are dead draws. The small quests situated over the board seem worthless; so far I've found no better strategy than quick leveling by the Underworld and assailing two red areas for your 8 points. Sort of amusing, though games really need to abandon this "one die determines the outcome of a battle" mechanic.

hmm, i really wanted to like this.  it has the flavor of WoW, which is commendible.  it is fairly easy to explain.  but, it is very long.  we played for three hours, and only one of us had a victory point.  it would probably speed up toward the later part of the game though.  i'd play game, but i don't have high hopes that it gets much better.

This is an extremely forgettable game.  I didn't absolutely hate it, but it didn't leave much of an impression on me either.  I just don't feel like there is much going on here and I even enjoy the material it is based on and many games like it.  For whatever reason this just completely misses the mark for me.

I played the Dungeon boardgame some as a kid as a quick alternative to pnp D&D. This game nearly scratches that itch. I'd only wish for a more generic theme, as most of this is Sanskrit to someone unfamiliar with WOW.

Roll die, move pawn, draw card to see what happens. Game is won by completing quests: Fight quests, travel quests, special event quests, interactive quests. Battle is done by rolling one die, add attack power, see if you reach target number, but is made more complex by the use of items and character-unique ability cards that affects your roll.
The perfect adventure game? I'd say no, but this comes as close as any game ever has done for me. My only negative comment is that the map you move across looks less than a map, and more like an abstract game board.
Part of my enjoyment of this game comes from recognizing stuff from the online game, but the game works very well evenso.
Hesitating between 8 or 9. I want to give this a 9, but it's not varied enough. It's almost all combats. That's a bit depressing. Okay, a 9 anyway.

Excellent implementation of the genre. Simpler rules, deeper choices, weird strats are viable, good for all player counts, multiple variants. In most 18XX only a few choices are hard, here most choices are. Interesting elements include viable small lategame companies, trains changing function depending on their company so merging is complex, and how to use local railways (hold for self, company, or sell?).

An 18xx with a special 2 player board and rules. Interested.

RATING: 7
First play. finished 3rd out of 5. quite interesting with the different local railways and the acquisitions. will be interesting to see if indeed the dominant strategy is to acquire as early as possible so that the large companies can jump twice and have more tokens. looking forward to more plays at different counts.

[2 Feb 2018] - 8.5 (1 play)
Played the 2 player variant and have to say it felt very similar to the 3 player 18xx games I've been able to play. The game is forgiving in terms of emergency financing and providing revenue early on. The complexity of this game seems to come from the 3 sizes of companies, merging those companies and the purple edged tiles. Failure to plan with those in mind are going to make the game rough. I do like the fixed turn style games instead of the bank breaking games at this moment. For a 2 player game, this does take up quite a bit of room on the table.

12/31/17 three plays so far, and its an interesting game. a bit on the long side for the play, but there are interesting choices and the board has developed differently in each game. That said, I'm pretty sure i lost the last 2 games finishing 3rd in a 3 and 4 player games because i didn't get priority in the 2nd to last stock round. The player who won din't buy a share in that round to ensure getting priority.  Don't know if this is a great element or a poor one, that one decision can be such a large determinant on the outcome. Also in the same game i played kingmaker between 1st and 2nd by buying the 1st players stock and not the second, when they were essentially equal buys.

This is a hand-made playtest copy of the playtest edition.  This is a consistently structured game with many interesting decisions.  The very strong "small, medium, large" structure makes the game easier to learn.

I have Kickstarted the new official version.

Components: really good
Complex: not hard to learn
Weight: heavy
Players: 3 to 5
Length: 3-4 hours
Mechanics: route building, stocks....
Decisions: think in a high number and multiply it by 10
Opinion: well, won't go into 18XX as there are better opinions out there about the family.
In this case we have 3 different companies, with different trains each. No bidding for private companies, which could be sold to companies and have abilities then, also they have a share value at the end.
Forced bought of trains is done with credits when the director has not enough money, no need to sell shares.
And the change of phase doesn't need to imply certain trains become obsolete, depends if that type of train is bough then, giving you a bit more of time to be ready for that.
Love the way the merges work, and how tight is everything on the map. Also the 3 type of companies make nice decisions where to invest or when to merge

The questions to explore in this game are myriad.  Shifting the focus from the stock game to an alternative operating game - one that focuses on financial management and a kind of voracious merging of tiered companies - its quite fascinating to imagine ways to shift these various gears - some smaller and faster, some larger and slower - to the benefit and sometimes saviour of self.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 8.2
Take this with a grain of salt as I'm somewhat new to the 18xx genre and have only slightly over a dozen 18xx plays under my belt to this point (1846, 1800, 1830, 18AL, 1880, 1867, 18FL). 

I certainly see the potential of this game and I love it. However, with the different size companies, multi-use trains, the purple edges tiles (no regular green or brown dinks?!?), the unusual way trains phase in, plus the different percentage payouts, I was really thrown for a loop on my first play.  I think it was just a lot to take in and there is a lot to juggle for a such a green player.  I expect that as I play more in the genre that it'll get easier to grasp but then again, it was my first time playing the game so I won't beat myself up too much. I'm looking forward to playing it again, perhaps once I get a bit more experience.

An interesting variant of 18XX set in the Czech republic.   It has small, medium and large companies.  Each has different rules for capitalization and floating.  Large companies can buy the small companies and money from small companies can be folded into your large company.  Prague is important to the game.  It does not have a bank like 1846 and is more of a builders game.  It plays quickly like 1846 but has the different company sizes like 1844.  

I liked this and would definitely play it again.

First time playing an 18XX, and I made some big mistakes that altered the late game for everyone. That said, looking at it purely as a tabletop game, I thought it was very well done. The way trains aged out was hard to track as a new player, and it made it hard to get any strategy. Definitely hard to judge on a single play. (This was a PNP copy, not production)

Like the game.  The geography is interesting.  The small, medium & big companies are matched with small, medium & big trains and small, medium, & big privates.  This is a nesw concept that makes the game interesting.  I am not sorry I bought the game..

Lonny Orgler's latest work. Took part in playtest sessions and it looks really good. 

Three tiers of companies: small, medium and large; bigger companies can absorb smaller companies, each tier has its own set of trains. Because of the small share limit, mergers are unavoidable.

One 4-player game. A bit rocky dealing with ALL the differences from either 1829/1830 branches. Winning score was 5366 with 1 Sm, 2 Med, and 1 Lg company. How typical this is I have no idea.

Many features streamlined and very much an engineer's game.  The seeming complexity is a bit of a red herring; preliminary plays show fewer actual choices than previously imagined.  Start small, merge, push trains.  Does it ever make sense to not acquire smaller companies?

Plenty of value in the box though, with the base game for 3-6, a smaller map for 2 with Vaclav, and a third map for 2 or 3.

--Dec2017-- Quite fascinating.  And, admittedly, a bit longer in play (at least on the first try) than we can play comfortably in an evening.  Still, the decisions, mutations and tradeoffs were all interesting.  I'd be delighted to reprise it, should the opportunity arise.

great game. 
I love the many twist inserted in the game: acquisition of smaller company, no share market, no real PAR, number of OR fixed, different companies size and rules.
The two variants (2p automa game, 2-3p map) make this game a perfect companion for different needs in player numbers, and game time

RATING: 7.5
Solid medium length 18XX game.  I've enjoyed this every time I've played it but it is starting to feel like the possible strategies are fairly limited after just a few plays.  I do like the small/medium/large companies and the fact that they run completely different types of trains.  The local companies are a nice feature in place of the typical private companies, allowing the placement of special green, brown, and gray tiles which are a critical component for how the board develops based on which companies are started and the localbahn owned by each player.

I much prefer to play 1862 in this time range, but I'm happy to play this from time to time if anyone else wants to try it out.  The localbahn acquired during the initial auction allow players to explore different areas of the map, but the game to game variance in how the board ends up developing don't seem to be very large.  Primarily the localbahn drive players towards starting specific companies but the board then mostly ends up with very similar track each game.

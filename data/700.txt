Might be a good source for WHQ miniatures...Gah, why did I not bid on this at the Buckeye Game Fest '07 auction?  I looked at the miniatures and they all seemed unable to stand on their own, so I figured I wouldn't have any use for them.  I could have picked up some slotta bases and had an enormous influx of minis for under $10.  

Sweet, trading Power Grid and both expansions for this and Memoir '44.  [update] Jeez, what a big box!  The minis will DEFINITELY work with WHQ and the slotta-bases I picked up.  Will just be a matter of time until I get a chance to play WHQ again.

Another disappointment to me as a teenager, all those years ago. All it really had in common with Heroquest (which I loved) was the combat system - none of the exploration. It had a massive unwieldy board (a plastic sheet really). It never got played. I sold it years ago.

I probably hate this game more than I should.  Game play is totally random, you aren't even sure when your pieces will be allowed to move, you have control over nothing.  Its like an even worse playing precurssor to Memoir '44 with more overblown production.

RATING: 5
Battle Masters sits in a peculiar position as being quite a light wargame along with not having much going on in the game, but also being fun as hell. Without the battle deck (that tells you what army pieces move), the game could've had much more depth. However, as is, the component quality is absolutely astounding. Each unit has a base with its own unique flag (stickers included) and several plastic minis that clip to the base. As they take damage, they are physically removed from the base and diminish. 

Combat is simple custom dice rolling. Many of the plastic figures are pre-colored and come with tons of decals. Modern games force you to paint uni-color minis. Comes with a RIDICULOUS huge mat that will take up your entire living room floor and is made of high quality material. Overall, if you want a cool out of print game without too much depth, Battle Masters can introduce someone into war gaming.

Three words:  "FUN AS HELL!"  I've played and like Heroscape and this little jem falls squarely into that category.  Sure it's a bit of a dicefest, but the huge mat, nice looking units and random card draw for the next player's move makes this one an interesting and fun game.  I originally bought this from a flea market with the intention of unloading elsewhere but after the first play, it's got a permanent place in my collection.

Warhammer Fantasy Battle the light version.  Not anything revolutionary and not nearly as iconic as Heroquest, but still a solid easy to play game and the pieces were fun.  My copy has largely been torn to pieces for other games with the game mat being used for 40k and Fantasy and the models making their way into various other games as flavor pieces.

Found this in my parents storage unit the other day.  Forgot I had it.  I remember liking this game a lot when I was younger, watching the pieces move on the big board.  A very simple gateway game for the wargame universe.  It also wins my award for bad box design because after putting the pieces together you couldn't fit them back in the box without taking them apart and possible ruining them.

Fantasy armies battle for control of the Empire on a 22.5 square foot battle mat.  The Chaos Army has 14 units and the Imperial Army has 11 units.  Simple battle rules and large pieces make this a great game for young gamers.  The game pieces and battle mat are highly adaptable to other uses.  Also consider the Command Card Variant posted at http://www.geocities.com/mapetty/bmasters.html

 It seems that fans are always trying to cobble together multiple games to help complete one. Let me help the collector or fan. This game is incomplete and damaged. Box is in rough shape. There is NO tower/vinyl battle mat/instruction booklet/Ogre champion or Mighty Cannon. There IS ONLY: 22/25 bases, 58/59 battle cards, 4/6 combat dice, 2/3 rubble tokens, 3/10 might cannon tiles, 1/4 plastic hedges, 23/25 Unit tokens, and 18/22 Elite tokens. All 4 Terrain tiles are present, as are all 6 ogre champion cards. Most of the figures that are present are either glued to their base or broken off. Chaos Army: 12/14 bases with 53/60 pieces (10/10 archers, 9/10 warriors, 5/10 orcs, 10/10 beastmen, 9/10 goblins, 3/3 champions, 5/6 wolf riders, 0/1 ogre champion--14 of the mentioned chaos pieces have broken halberds, axes, etc.) Imperial Army: 10/11 bases with 31/43 pieces (5/9 knights, 3/3 lord knights, 15/15 men at arms, 4/5 crossbowmen, 4/10 archers, and 0/1 Mighty Cannon{although both artillery men are present...both broken}--Most of these pieces have broken axes, bows, etc.

If you have lots of space, and a young or beginning player, this game is actually a great way to spend time. The card system is a bit too random, sometimes giving one player a runaway lead, but the game is light enough that you don't get bogged down by that, and you can always set up again. 
I have only set this game up once, but if I get the chance again, I might try some variants. (Three cards in your hand, for example.)

Great game and plain big fun for kids and adults alike. Pure toy factor, high production values, and bargain price (back in the day) pushes it up to a 9. Would be a 10 if the game itself were more enagaging. As is, parts often drift into Warhammer armies. The map is sometimes used as a ground mat for an air-combat game called Canvas Eagles.

Awesome components, and a little more strategy (IMO) than most will give it credit for - especially when you don't play the campaign.  Ultimately, a kids' game, and the "8" reflects that - if I were to rate it as a serious strategy game, of course it would be much lower.

Despite some quirks, an awful lot of pure luck, and a daunting size for most dining room tables, I can't help enjoying this game when I play it! There is a lot of light-hearted fun here as long as you don't take any of it too seriously.

The suspense when the "Imperial Mighty Canon," or the "Chaos Ogre," comes to bat never fails to amuse me. I just wish I had managed to come across the expansion materials when they were available.

Childhood favourite. Complete, good condition.

House rules to try with the kiddos:

1- The number of HP of a unit equals the number of miniatures on the tile. Cannon is worth 3 HP.

2- The defender counter attack with his skulls. So the defender can inflict damage to the attacker which are blocked by the shields of the attacker.

3- Separate the cards of each player in 2 different deck. Players start with 3 cards in their hand. On their turn, they play a card from their hand and draw a new card.

As a big fan of HeroQuest when I was a kid, it was inevitable that I ended up playing Battle Masters too. It wasn't quite as immersive, and I remember finding the strategy a little lacking, but even so, it was one of the most exciting games I'd ever played at the time, so very different to everything else in our house - the usual suspects of Monopoly and Cluedo etc. Opening it on Christmas Day was incredible, the sheer scale of the game overwhelmed. Although I've never played another wargame since, it left an indelible mark, and would serve as a fantastic introduction to the genre, it's as a much a 'Wargame-Lite' and HeroQuest was an 'RPG-Lite'. I have wonderful memories of playing this, and I'm very excited to have just found myself a replacement copy, can't wait to play.

RATING: 6
Good introduction to miniatures wargaming.  I like the action card deck in that each side gets a fixed number of moves but the order in which those moves occur is random.  Creates some nice ebb and flow where one side gets several actions in a row and then the other.  Not much point to playing it as adults, but it is good to play with kids even as young as 5 or 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
UPDATE:  I believe that this game has no weaknesses as an introductory strategy game, and the knowledge gained playing this as a kid translates perfectly into more advanced tactical games like Memoir 44 or other C&C games.  It may also translate well to tabletop miniatures games, but I don't play those so I am not sure.

Taught it to my seven-year-old son on Friday night.  He taught it to my nine-year-old daughter Saturday morning.  Nine-year-old daughter taught it to eleven-year-old daughter Saturday afternoon and Saturday night, all four of us were playing a team game.

The rating is "8."  This game is just FUN.

This is one heckuva MASSIVE game.  In my opinion though it seems it could've been pulled off on a board ONE TENTH the size of the one it uses.  The large pieces have no true function other than eye candy so it makes for a very hard game to store once assembled.  The assembly took place over two days so I can undestand how we picked it up BRAND NEW from KB Toys for $9 in the bargain bin.  Fun, but too big.

As much an experience as a game. The massive box contains a gigantic plastic mat taking up all available floorspace and dozens of well sculpted pieces to match.  Decent gameplay with some nice touches like the cannon and the orges but nothing special on that front, though a lot better than you would expect from a mass market game.

2 weeks ago I picked up my partial BattleMasters and fixed it.  I built the missing cannon with black duct tape and a pill bottle.  I fixed busted pieces with superglue.  And I played it.

RATING: N/A
The game is simplistic compared to other wargames and miniatures games. I am not particularly fond of the "activate a unit only if you are fortuitous enough to have the corresponding unit card in your hand" gameplay. Although it may be more realistic or trendy (see BattleCry and Memoir 44), it is too random for my tastes. The miniatures themselves are above average in quality, and can be used with the Warhammer Fantasy Battles tabletop game.

Why do I own 2 sets of this mega game and why its high ranking. The answer is simple the shear quantity of miniatures made this my first real intro into miniature wargaming. It also had a simplistic battle system that I`ve used to make my own miniature battle game that
far exceeds anything else I`ve played. Too many miniature
games strive for so much realism that bogs play down with endless dice rolling slugfests. Two presett armies
across from one another. Canons/catapults/archers/lancers
/heavy and light infantry/crossbows/dragon riders/wizards
and some heroes/leaders and a simple battle system. What more do you want?

This game is warhammer, dumbed down into your typical hexagon war game.  I'm not completely convinced it is very well balanced.  The balancing issues stem from teh cards.  Every unit has has a number of cards.  You use those cards to attack and to move (usually at the same time).  The problem is that while the Empire units are very powerful individually, they lack in number of units, and then in number of cards.  

If you stacked up every unit in the game an fight a linear battle, the Chaos team would win every single time, hands down.  

In addition, the mighty cannon should only fire 3 times max before exploding, and the cannon shells only go 2 spots effectively.  The archer can also only shoot two spots, and are weak to just about every enemy unit out there.  

So what happens is that the Empire team falls back into a defensive formation and hopes to catch the Chaos team in a bad spot, every single time.  An offensive Empire team is almost nonexistant.

Which is probably why the "campaign" described in the rules encourages the Chaos player to attack more often than not.

Finally, this game was far too complex for the age group it was marketed against. I can see how Warhammer players can view this game as "oversimplified" or a "great start" into the hobby, but in reality Warhammer and 40k can really only be played by mid to late teens.  And even then most I have known struggle somewhat with the weight of the rules.

Younger kids just don't get it.  And when this game came out most people I knew (early teens) couldn't grasp it either.  Younger siblings of mine seriously struggled with it and just got bored.

The only saving grace of this game was that it was huge.  People loved it when you pulled it out, but hated it once it got started.

In summary, this game was aimed at too young of children, and it was fairly unbalanced from the starting blocks.  It's only saving grace was the novelty of the oversized board.

This game is great low-tech fun. There is a great deal of chaos (no pun intended) on the battlefield. If you like great looking pieces and furious dice-fests, this is for you. Really good with family and non-wargamers. 

On the other hand...
If you are looking to exert a great deal of control over your forces, or you revel in executing perfectly planned tactical operations, this might not be for you, as the card deck which randomizes movement, plus the dice for combat, make it tough to pull off any kind of coherent manuevers!

I just don't play Battlemasters  anymore. I did when I was growing up. I gave my copy of Battlemasters to my nephew. Battlemasters was fun when I was a kid, not today though. I moved on to better games.

Played once so far with my nephew and showed him the rules. I explained it to him how the game works and what was a typical game of Battlemasters. It can be an interesting game for a kid. It takes a lot of floor space to play.

It was more or less interesting for me since he wasn't really paying attention to what I was saying. His parents are not really gamers, so there isn't a huge interest for him where board games is concerned.  Maybe in 2-3 years he will have more interest in board games, who knows.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I might play Battle Masters again with my nephew if his attention span is better.

I'm giving this game a well deserved 9/10, not on it's gameplay, but rather on the totality of this 25 year old game's contribution to wargaming and its pure awesomeness as a product meant for 10 year-olds. For all the grousing of modern wargamers about simplified rules and baby's first wargames, this truly was a beginner's wargame and it showed the usefulness of such products. It included all the basics of moving and attacking across a scale battlefield and provided two wonderfully colorful fantasy armies right in the box. The activation elements were simple, but modern design shows random activation is hardly a bad thing. The cannon and the ogre also added a very random, but also very fun element to the game, capable of going off smashing too much in some games, but failing to do enough in others. It was an excellent idea at the time, and perhaps the world wasn't quite ready for it back then as I don't believe it sold too well, and I'll always have fond memories for this game.

Really, this is the most overproduced game ever. At least some games that are overproduced use their overproduced goodies. This one is all fluff and the billions of plastic pieces really just add to the detail, not to the game.  That is EXACTLY why I wanted this.  It's really a simple die-chucking wargame.  As fun as a game of this simplicity can get.  Little thought behind it but this game is all about creating those mythical stories between the Imperial and Chaos forces.  There is no other game that requires an ENTIRE FLOOR to play!  Happy to have it.

RATING: 7.5
This simple war game uses the HeroQuest battle system and in many ways is the predecessor to HeroScape.  So why bother with Battle Masters?  Because the massive amount of figures in the box (well over 100) combined with no nonsense game mechanics and a ready-to-play game board makes it a relative breeze to pick up and play.  Perfect for if you are introducing a youngster to combat games, looking for a casual slugfest wargame to play with a buddy or if you are needing a no-brainer solitare experience for yourself.  Also, the unique units, the Mighty Cannon and the Ogre, are both a lot of fun to play.  I recommend you peruse the Variants section of these forums for ways to add more strategy since the game as originally designed is largely luck dependant.

RATING: 7
Box is pretty heavily worn and warped, given the age and size of this beast, but otherwise the only thing missing is the cannon targeting disc, which is completely unnecessary for play (just point out your target and start dealing) and/or can be easily replaced online.

Another collaboration between Games Workshop and Milton Bradley, I was hoping this would be another fun introduction to miniatures games the same way HeroQuest was.  Alas, it wasn't.  It was simply a dull game with little strategy and miniatures that were affixed to huge, clunky bases.  With a little more action and fun, this could have been a great "Warhammer for kids" game, but it always felt like a missed opportunity to me.

I probably would have loved it when it came out, but not now. Heroscape is superior in every conceivable way and they are quite comparable. This one doesn't have much strategy to it.

A good introductory wargame I guess, but severely outshined by later releases.

Battle Masters offers lots of nice miniatures and an unequalled huge playing field, but also poor and simple gameplay.

Loved this game as a child, but since then, my tastes in games have changes drastically.  Its a great intro to Wargamming, and captures the imagination with a large expansive war mat and lots of models going head to head in battle.  The rules are a bit soft and the two forces are not super balanced, but not terrible.  

Overall a fun experience when you're younger, but only a stepping stone into a real wargaming experience.

Interesante wargame que enfrenta al Ejército Imperial, contra las hordas de los Corsarios del Caos. Y digo interesante porque para ganar la guerra, has de hacer una campaña, que consta de 5 batallas, en las cuales se otorgan puntos. Pero no todas las batallas puntúan igual. Los esquemas de preparación vienen en las instrucciones normales, pues las simplificadas son para empezar. Aunque de una temática distinta a mi favorita, en su día fue una grata sorpresa encontrar un juego como éste.

Great minis! However, they are entirely superfluous.

I bought three copies of this game on closeout price at Toys R Us when I was a kid. I wasn't interested in the game, actually. I wanted the huge numbers of miniatures to use in Warhammer Fantasy Battle. The sculptors are from the same company and they are made to the same scale and cost about 1/5 of the price.

This game was the only thing on my want list for my tenth Birthday. My parents gave me the rule book a couple of days early because it was huge and I needed to read it ahead of time so I could play on my birthday. My dad cut all the pieces out of the plastic and put all the stickers on it so it was ready for me to play.  Great memories of a game that got me into this money pit of a hobby.

Amazing components and a fun battlefield adaptation of Hero Quest.  Unfortunately, the card-driven movement mechanism makes formulating strategies an impossibility and can make the game very frustrating when combined with the luck of the die rolls.

RATING: 4
Bought this as an 8th grader when it first came out and only played it once due to space limitations and gameplay suited for a slightly younger audience.  The rules as written make the game far too random for most adult gamers to enjoy.  However, using alternative "activation deck" rules I think that most adults would enjoy playing this WITH their children.
  The components are nice to look at but the figures are fragile and tend to break.  Additionally, they are large, don't fit back into the box assembled and the game takes up A LOT of space in play.  

All that being said I am giving two Ratings.  For kids (and adults playing with their kids) this game is a 7.  Your little ones will love it.  For any older teens or adults looking for a good ultra-light introduction to minis games, this game is a 2.  I don't see it holding your interest or being a good  intro to minis game (play heroscape instead).

A fantastic novice to intermediate level game. The production values are through the roof, and the miniatures are perfect for the game itself and for any Dungeons and Dragons setting! The rules are easy to learn, and the time needed to play the game is not excessive. The one negative might be that the game pieces bend and break too easily. Otherwise, this is the perfect game to work off your aggressive energies!

Played with my four year old grandson. That's right. Four. He won our first game. Seriously. He won. Yes, four years old. I didn't bother with tactics all that much, such as screening my archers with infantry. I just wanted to teach him the basic mechanics of how to move and attack. He was delighted with the game, and took to it very well. Bought it on E-Bay for just this purpose. Cost me $11.50 (I got lucky). I rated it 6.5, but the fun we had was priceless.

Yawn. So you make a game monster size to give it appeal, but if it were the same game but at a sane regular size, would it be fun? Decent figures. Game play includes percentage dice, which is fun, and movement is dictated by cards, which is not fun. If you have a squad killed off, you WILL pull that squads card for movement when you most need to do something else. Bad game Karma possibilites do not make for a fun time.

Unit movement choice is entirely random and the deck more than your tactics decides the outcome of every game.  For kids this game is at least a 7 though, the components are plentiful and sweet.  Would be better to play this game using Battlelore rules, with Battlelore card decks and converting units to Battlelore stats.  Conversion to Battlelore stats would be a snap, except for the ogre and great cannon.

I got this when it was brand new (I was 7), and while I didn't really get it, it was fun to assemble the figurines.  Only years later did I dig it out of the closet and give it another go.  I really liked playing this game, even though it took some careful rearranging of the furniture to be able to play. It is with memories of this that I am looking forward to playing Battlelore.  An epic-sized but light miniatures game.

Good simple strategy war game. The problems is that the maps is too big to find a place to play. There is also no way to customize your army, chaos seemed advantaged. Also had to change some rules because the random card drawing left little strategy and it even break the game once.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really want to love this game, but certain design flaws are really apparent. The fact is that the game is balanced to unfortunately favor the imperials. A victory can be gotten by the chaos army but it is much harder. I am getting a second deck to try and rebalance the cards and make it better. The gameplay is solid and the miniatures are amazing. It looks great all set up, and I'm hoping my tweaks will balance it better because I really like this game, but my rating is based on the game as is.

It's a great game to play with a child. Takes up a whole living room and has very colorful pieces. The cards take care of most of the movements and attacks, so it can almost be solitare. On the other hand, if you don't pay attention to how pieces move and when you can loose important pieces fast. So just because your Troll can cross the board in 2 turns does not mean he should move without support. So it's not a mindless game. Really a good game to start a kid out on strategy games IMO.

The love child of Milton-Bradley and Games Workshop. Not as awesome as Heroquest.

That's not fair in my opinion!

One of my favorite games as a kid -- it just comes with so damned many awesome components, including the biggest game mat I've ever owned.

It's a very simple game, but the sheer size and scope of it make it thoroughly enjoyable.

I purchased this game in the 1990's. It has great bits for the time and looked like it would be an interesting game since I didn't have anything like it. I played the game once and that was it. I got so frustrated with the Cannon; I never could hit a target because the cannon ball would always blow up before it got to the target. Meanwhile, my opponent just kept beating the heck out of me every time the Ogre was used. Add that frustration to the setup time, and having to set the game up on the floor, and that was enough for me to stick it in my closet where it has been for years.

It does have some fun elements, though, and seems like a good candidate for a gateway wargame with my son.

I played this several times long ago.  This was the first game that I felt like painting the minitures.  The miniatures are very good.  The game has good tension and allows for simple to medium level strategies.  The biggest negative was the gimicky mechanic for the cannon/ogre.  It made them much more ineffective than I hoped and felt they should be.  This game is about as simple as a wargame can get.  It is a transition to light wargames and miniatures games.  It plays fairly quickly and has easy to understand rules.  I enjoyed it during my late elementary to early middle school years.

Despite so many bits, a gorgeous map, and a huge "toy factor", the system is reduced to an overly-simplified (and very dicey) combat system with nearly meaningless terrain.  The battle cards need some text on them, as the pictures are cryptic and really slowed down our lone play.

Die Claymore Saga hat in meiner Kindheit für große Augen und öffene Münder gesorgt. Die resigen Armeen voller Citadel-Miniaturen waren einfach nur beeindruckend und das Spielfeld bestand aus einer riesigen Plastikmatte, die mal eben den gesamten Fußboden eines durchschnittlichen Kinderzimmers bedeckte. Im Spiel haben sich dann wirklich epische Schlachten entwickelt, die aus heutiger Sicht betrachtet, sehr stark vom Glück abhängig waren. welche Karten ziehe ich? Wie gut würfel ich? Vielleicht explodiert meine tolle Kanone direkt beim ersten Schuss? In den 90ern war das durchaus okay, heutzutage ziehe ich Spiele mit mehr taktischer Tiefe vor.

OK, as a child I completely destroyed HeroQuest and Fireball Island but somehow Battle Masters survived with 100% of its components?!  Don't ask me how that happened.

Requires a good deal of floor space.  The mechanic of drawing a single card at a time to determine which units get to move is annoying, particularly when one player gets to move several times in a row while the other player is just sitting there.

Hands down the fundamental game for eaching very young kids (as in age six) wargaming. No better game to do that, then this one.

What an incredible and simple game that makes it very easy to get kids to play. Why? First,because of the huge map and great components are solid eye candy and make movement very visible and second, they can grasp the game's rules right away.

The game teaches great fundamentals for future games: card driven system, line of sight, hex movement and ranged attack, tiles that reduce or improve combat attack value, units with different combat values.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game.  It's part luck part strategy, but that makes the game different every time.  Plus who could hate a game with a four foot battle map.  It's extremely simple to learn, yet it still appeals to the older crowd because of its strategy element.

I used to play this for hours in my parent's house when I was a kid. Instead of game board there is a game map, which unfolds into a landscape on which the battles take place. By now, I realize Battle Masters is pretty much the most toned down version of miniature wargaming you can find, but it is good for young kids or people who prefer a simpler and more in-your-face approach to war gaming.

Loved this game when I was little. Part of that love was how big the game was. This and Torpedo Run always got rave reviews partly because of the "look how big our friggin game is" factor.

Not played since I was a kid. I had so much fun with this when I played with my Dad. I hope I'll be able to play it with my kids as they get older. I wouldn't mind acquiring an extra copy or two (or just a pile of extra pieces) so I can enjoy it long into the future. The components are great for the most part.

I do wish there was more variety when it came to terrain. Hills, gulleys, trees, roads, ditches, etc. would have been nice. All with their own characteristics that modify the battlefield of course. I also wish there was more to the tactical game than drawing cards. I think these criticisms could easily be remedied with house rules and playtesting. Perhaps when I have more free time in the future!

But it needs a lot of room, no table will hold it.

But as said, be prepared to go down on all fours...

I really like this game and have for a long time.  The drawback is the amount of space you need to play this one (the battle mat is about the size of queen size mattress (as on my bed is usually where I set this up for play)).  It does't offer as much depth and complexity as other similar games do, but sometime you just want a light, easy miniature game that is still fun to play.  As much as I like playing this game, I think it will lose a lot of future plays to Battlelore, as it has a similar play style and I enjoy it more.

I'm giving this a 4 not because the rules or gameplay are horrible, but because you really have to have a lot of room to play it, which is nearly impossible if you rent small apartments.

This one is worth finding & playing! I enjoyed it very much! It does take awhile to put everything together, but it's worth it. 

You can probably play this game on a queen size bed or a ping-pong table because anything is better than playing on the floor! 

I have everything sorted out into bags for each different troops. The flags, pieces and platform all go into each corresponding bag. It helps cut back on prep time. It's a fun game, try it out!

This one sucks badly. In Germany it's called the Claymore Saga. This must be the most imbalanced game ever. The one playing the good guys must be stupid in order to loose. There's one good thing about the map though. If you cut it in half or in thirds, you can use it as a table cloth (that is, if you are a giant and have a huge table) and that way, there is at least a purpose for this otherwise terrible game.

I played the full campaign on 10/12/03 for the first time. I liked it, but found that the chaos are a lot weaker.
We played using the command card variant, so it may play different the normal way, but I think the variant gives some strategic skill to the game.

RATING: 7.2
Even with each unit contained in its own separate baggie, this monster still takes the best part of 30 minutes to set up.  I can only imagine how long it would take to assemble from scratch, applying the plethora of insignia stickers accurately to the large number of miniatures that come with the game, all of which would have to be removed from their sprues.  Contrary to what is written in the description, this takes AT LEAST 90 minutes to play, generally more.  Because of the daunting set-up time, the game loses 0.5.

Everything about this game is big, from the oversized box the components come in to the huge colourful vinyl playmat that serves as the battlefield.  The hexes are around 6" wide.  When the game is set up & in progress, onlookers are subjected to an orgy of visual pleasure, with over 100 minis going for it.

The depictions on the cards which determine the sequence of events are easily learnt & gameplay is very simple.  The rules are clear & well set out.

Most boys eight years & over would give their right arm for this one.

I regularly let it be known how gaudy and childish-looking I think plastic miniatures are, but this is a game I owned as a kid and wish I still had. 

I owned and loved Hero Quest. Being 10 or 11 and getting a game with a board that was a roll out map bigger than several of me, with all these cool little army units to move around and a tower and so forth--that was mind blowing to my prepubescent brain. I think this would actually hold up reasonably well if played as light fun, and for nostalgic purposes. I still remember the way the cannon balls would bounce across the field!

This is the very first wargame I played; only Risk and possibly Stratego compete for that place.

A very simple game, not very complex at all, but the game is still fun and doesn't take alot of time. The only drawback that i have seen is the use of the card to move/attack, it elimates alot of strategy due to the cards. I do like the look af the figures and I have played with people who had the time to paint their armies.

Probably as close to a perfect game as I've ever played. Incredibly simple game mechanics, but with wonderful variety from game to game because of the ability to customize maps, and because of luck of the draw in terms of how the armies maneuver. Also fun to play a game that involves spreading out a massive map on the floor! I can't say enough about this one. It breaks my heart that no one is selling this any longer. This game should be available to everyone.

When I saw this game I said wow.  When I opened the box I said wow.  When I finished painting the figures I said thank God for that.  If you want to get your younger kids into board or figure gaming, this is the business.  The weight category should have featherweight for this one.

RATING: 6
Extremely simple and hence good for kids. 
Makes a great spectacle, too. The rules cry out for expansion -- there are differing number of figures per unit base, but that has no effect on combat! As a game kit this is probably an 8 or a 9, but the fight-to-the-last-man gameplay will quickly pale for hardcore gamers.

Maybe the most ridiculous game ever made.  No table made by mankind is large enough for the board (mat), which will soon be covered in hundreds of minis slaughtering eachother with dice, none of which the players have much control over.  A bit of house ruling is required to make it competitive, but the sheer spectacle is always a blast.

I imagine that if Bear Grylls was ever asked what boardgame he would take to a deserted island with him that he would pick this.

The battle mat would make an excellent shelter, poncho, water carrier, signal flag, sail for a raft...

Basically plays itself.  The only choices in this game are where to move or who to attack - which are usually obvious choices anyway.

The fact that this is rated over 5 is a pretty clear indicator that a lot of people value style & nostalgia over actual substance.  100% luck is no good in LCR, but it's fine when there's miniatures involved!

A very light and shallow but cool looking miniatures boardgame.  It's ruled by luck (mainly through the frustrating card draw order of play), but it's easy enough to tweak the luck factor down a bit with a houserule or two.  And it's just really fun to watch all the awesome pieces in this game spill out across the map in battle.

When you see people use the phrase "box of toys", this is most definitely one of the games they're talking about.

Great game from my childhood. Great for younger gamers, which is what it was designed for. The Empire are much better than the Chaos forces as I remember unless you allow Chaos  the full army move when their army card comes up. I played this and hero quest as a kid and I really enjoyed both of them at that time. This rating system is somewhat flawed in my opinion because you won't find me playing battle masters much--but i'll teach it to my kids/grand kids and i'm sure they'll love it too!

This could have been a great game.  The figures are a major pain to put together and the game mat wasnt the best.  I like the mechanics of the game, and it is fun to play.  However with games like Heroscape out I doubt I will play much.  If there was ever a remake, with improved figures and such I will definately buy it!  And of course the Orge and Cannon ROCK  :)

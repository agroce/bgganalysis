RATING: 10
One of the best games I have ever played. Thematically rich, beautifully asymmetric and very challenging.

Rating is based on a few plays with only a starter, and it was an amazing experience, but my rating might change.

My plan is to develop the starter into two varied and balanced decks with no duplicates - the ultimate two player game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
A nearly perfect CCG. Awesome theme and setting. Assymetric with totally different feel to playing either side. REALLY AWESOME if both players have a small pool of cards to work with. Starter decks are completely playable, but usually sorely lacking in money-makers and too full of useless cards (like multiple decks for the runner). But I don't want to pay the $$$ required for hard core constructed, either. Still, really awesome 2 player cyberpunk game; the best cyberpunk card/board game out there.

Excellent game in and of itself.  One of the best CCG's ever released.  Brought down by the collectible aspect.  Would be an 8 or 9 if re-released as a complete 2 player card game.

RATING: 8
The best strong asymmetrical game I've encountered. Deck construction and collection are secondary considerations. Fairly well-balanced and flavorful. It can be picked up for relatively cheap now, and it's probably best if just played out of starter boxes (which were designed to be playable, unlike many of the starter boxes of CCGs during the time).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For me, this is simply the best thing Richard Garfield ever did. Asymmetric deck design, coupled with tight card design makes this simply one of the best CCG's ever published. Excellent playability right out of the box (without requiring 1000's of cards) was, ironically, parts of it's eventual downfall. Arguably the best dead/ undead CCG out there for my money.

1st Edition.

RATING: 10
Simply amazing! What an innovative game: this game was decades ahead of its time. It could easily be the best game ever made, although it has to be said that alot of the cards were excessively overpowered for Constructed. But for Sealed Deck I think this is the *ultimate game*.

A very kewl themed-CCG.  I really feel like a hacker!  I think that's what everyone wants.  And then there's the psychological component of out-witting the hacker.  I just can't get enough players in my area to play this game with me.

Very [i]Neuromancer[/i] in mood and feel. The gameplay is thematic, asymmetrical, and has more bluffing and strategy than usual in CCGs. Forget that it's collectible and play with interesting, evenly matched decks. UPDATE: Netrunner is dead! Long live Netrunner LCG, aka Android Netrunner!

The best CCG/TCG made. Period.
Netrunner is assymetrical in that a Runner is taking on a Corporation. It's fast, devious and sweet to play when a chosen strategy pays off.
It's sad that WotC has let this game die because if it were re-released without the collectibility it would sell fairly well. This is another example of a game where the desire to maximize profits overwhelmed the potential long term life of the product. Another shame is that the 2nd expansion had far too limited a release.

RATING: 8
Beautifully asymmetric from the ground up, gotta love that.  Great theme, even as a non-fan of the subject.  Good bluffing and chance elements.  Few things in gaming compare to randomly pulling an agenda from the corporation player's hand or deck!  Explainable rules, although some of the special terms seem unnecessary.  Excellent rulebook.  People seem to go on and on about the innate playability of the starters, and I agree that the collation in terms of icebreaking and agendas and such looks good.  Still, our games seemed to come down to effective resource screwage in the "money" (bits) department.  With a very limited card pool for deck construction, it seems that the corporation is favored but I still think the game is a blast.  I'm cautiously investigating adding more cards to the pool via acquisition since I'm currently enjoying making the best of what I've got.  I suppose I enjoy the limited side of CCGs more than I thought, since even with dead or inexpensive games I'm disinclined to give myself a billion of every card.  I feel that way about a lot of things, though.

Here's what you get from Netrunner.

A very strong, very entertaining, asymmetrical card game.  A battle between a computer hacker and a mega-corporation.  The Hacker builds up a suite of programs, hardware, and resources in order to penetrate the electronic fortress that his opponent builds to protect sensitive corporate information.

The corp has various nodes and agendas he is trying to advance. He installs them in his network of walls and sentries, which are meant to "discourage" ambitious hackers from jacking in and stealing precious data.

The game is a joy to play and the two different sides are distinctly different from one another.  The real key to the game and the thing that keeps it from being a mundane exercise in tit-for-tat card play is the economy.

The funds you  need to activate ("rez") your ICE (corporate defensive software), or break those sub-routines (as the hacker) are typically all too hard to find.  This leads to all sort of interesting decisions.  Paying to deal with one threat will likely expose you to another.  

This is a game of bluff and risk.  It's an arms-race where the hacker and corp are constantly shifting their resources around in order to get the upper-hand.  The game works amazing when the balance of power tips back and forth between the two players.

That said:  This _IS_ a card game and sometimes subject to the whimsy of fate.  You'll run into games where the corp simply cant draw enough ICE to keep the runner out and is eliminated quickly and easily.  The same is true for the runnner -- it can be super frustrating to watch the corp advance agenda after agenda behind a weenie little code-gate because you cant find that program you need to break it.

Luckily games like that are typically short and merciful and it's easy to just shuffle up and play again.

If you have access to some old cards you only need a starter set to get going and have a blast for hours and hours.

If you cant get those cards we have the new Android "living" version coming out soon!

Update: Well, more recent customizable card games have highlighted the flaws inherent to original Netrunner. The period of time when I played it incessantly is still one of my favorite chunks of gaming ever. It just doesn't hold a candle to games such as Thrones 2.0 or even LotR: The Card Game. I still can't bring myself to rate it below a 9 however.

----------

Complete set (v1.0, v2.0, v2.1)

My favorite CCG.  Quick-playing (20-40 mins) and very intense matches make for one of the best card games ever designed.

Don't believe any of the "too complicated" mumbo jumbo found throughout online comments and reviews -- this game has a very elegant ruleset.  Granted there are only 580 cards in the entire set, but the rather slim CRF is filled mostly with clarifications.  A VERY small amount of errata was issued for Netrunner and only two cards ever banned from competitive play.  Netrunner is Candyland when compared to MECCG (my second favorite CCG).

Also, if the perceived balance issues actually do exist between the two roles, I've never experienced them.  I'll gladly take Runner over Corp anyday!  =D

I was never really good at playing this game, I just didn't have it in my to build a better deck or to manage all the different stacks and whatnot.  I really like it though, and still have all my cards for it.  Proteus was a crappy expansion, and then there was some 3rd party that realeased a really good expansion, but it was after the NetRunner chicken had flown the CCG coop.  Jon and I played it in a hoity toity coffee place (The Hungry Mind) downtown Manhattan Beach in what was my first public display of gaming, other than D&D on the playground during recess.  Good times, good game.

I had six starters of this.  I enjoy playing the starters plain.  I gave one starter away to a friend who now scours ebay for Netrunner, and I have starter up for trade.

Unfortunately, has been gathering dust in a box due to lack of local audience.

I'm rating this down to a 7 since I'd rather play the FFG LCG.

The first CCG, and gamer-game, that I ever learned.  Looking back, I'm surprised I was able to play this competently (I think) at 10 years old.

I can't think of a game that does a better job of incorporating theme into the game.  You really do feel like an independent, underpaid hacker is trying to take down a well-funded and shady corporation.  Great design for limited (sealed) play, but not so sure the constructed environment was handled well.  Fantastic 2-player game.

Of all the CCG's, the design of this one was a step above the rest.  Not a Magic cookie-cutter like so very (very very very) many others, this game introduces radically different mechanics than I've seen anywhere else.  

Love it to death.  Even with my CCG days far behind me, I still get out this one and marvel at how brilliantly, daringly different it was.  

Outdated and gone now.

We play with hardly boosted starters (I think 2 or 3 boosters) for quite some time. I´m not really into CCGs and deckbuilding, but the game is even fun with only the starter pack. Of course throwing in a couple of boosters after some time adds to the fun, but I see it more as an expansion than as deck optimization.

Nice oop CCG that few under my radar when it was 1st published.  I really enjoy the asymmetrical game mechanice of the Corp and Runner decks.  Each has its own unique flavor and I think each has a legitimate shot to win.  My only complaint is that the art on the cards is very mediocre and the layout could have differentiated the varios types of cards better.  

Still I look foward to playing more of this fine game and getting some trades in for better cards.

Doesn't play very well between players of differing experience levels , but I suspect thats true of lots of CCGs.  This is a great game.

It helps to keep the leader in check (unlike in Magic where lots of stuff can happen in a turn, and it can be really hard to catch up)

Garfield does it again and, for me, this is a better game than MtG! I would argue though that no one else out there has designed a better pair of fantasy/sci-fi games.  For anyone who's ever read Neuromancer or any of the later cyberpunk genre this game catches that atmosphere perfectly.  It is one of the few examples of an aysymetrical two player game, yet is generally pretty balanced despite that. Throw in some innovative mechanisms for a CCG that make this almost a board game and you have an intruiging package.  In some ways it's a shame it's no longer published but, you know what - it doesn't really matter - the game remains as good as it ever was.  If buying a 'dead' CCG bothers you just think of it as buying an out of print board game!

I can see why this game is considered the best-designed CCG.  I like the modular turns, and the player interaction is superb.  It plays best right out of the box with no deck modification.

RATING: 5
While not a bad game per se, this game really didn't do much for me, as neither the play nor the construction angles had much compelling going on from a game perspective - certainly the game was nowhere near as interesting as the Middle-Earth CCG, the deck construction had nothing on Magic, and it didn't seem to strike a nice middle ground. Again, you could do much worse, but not one to spend a huge amount of money on. This is often referred to as a very high quality CCG that didn't catch on, but I think the consumer got it right, as they often do - this just wasn't that great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great asymetric design, cool theme, and completely playable straight from the starter decks.

Collecting is an optional labour of love rather than an arms race obligation. It's possible (although maybe a bit heretical to say it) but my instinct is this game has been improved by being OOP.

First few games were very enjoyable. The 4 actions per turn allows flexibility that is refreshing in a CCG. You choose to: draw, generate bits (mana), play cards, make a run if you are the runner or advance an agenda if you are the corporation. This means if you are desparate for specific cards or for bits you can get them. As others have observed the two decks from the starter were well balanced over the games we played. I would like to try to build decks though because the starters did play a little arkwardly and the decks contained obvious dud cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The most intense, and satisfying challenge I have ever faced while gaming was a session of this game in which I won as the runner, never having more than 4 memory units available, and risking everything to make that last - successful run.

Very replayable, you might think you're in a hole, but there always seems to be something you can do to better your situation.  Both sides play differently, and both immerse you in the role into which you are cast.  The runner must be aggressive and daring, the Corp methodical and defensive, and both must be economical in their use of bits.

The rules could be better written, online summaries improve on the original.

It is easier for newbies to win as the corporation, with experience the runner gains the advantage.  Both will be rewarded with an excellent gaming experience.

The best and only asymmetric CCG out there and which has some of the most brilliant CCG mechanics ever " (stolen from echdareez 'cause I whole-heartedly agree). Of course, being such a great game it wasn't well supported during its infancy and was quickly  dropped by its publisher, Wizards of the Coast in 1996 - 1997 after only one expansion (Proteus). However, the strong following it has over 10 years after its "demise" should show you something: Netrunner has something other card games does not. Unlike others CCGs, a heavy collection is not necessary; more rares will not give you a better deck necessarily. Luck is very limited to a few die rolls, but lots of Strategic and Tactical decisions pervade the game, making it the best

RATING: 4
A now-dead CCG with a theme that I really like and gameplay that I really don't. In a Gibson-like world, the players represent asymmetrical sides: the Corp and the Runner. The corp tries to erect data fortresses and push agendas, the runner tries to break through and steal them. Each side plays completely differently, and has unique gameplay decisions.

From a play standpoint, I find this title theoretically interesting but the bluff element is not something that I generally care for in games to this degree. Many people swear by the true sealed deck method, which I can see the charm of (it's the only way I've played so far) but I think I would wear out the sealed pair of decks pretty quickly. I can see the weakness of constructed though: if the decks don't match up well, then one side will slash and burn the other without trying all that hard. So it seems that the ideal is some sort of format that allows remaking random but balanced decks...which seems like a logistical nightmare.

This has now been reimplemented as Android: Netrunner, so I see no real reason to play the original anymore unless you're rich / enthusiastic enough about sealed deck play to just buy new decks and exclusively play it that way.

The quintessential cult classic CCG.  It's every bit as good as you've heard and I entreat you to get to Ebay and buy it before it's completely gone.  This game was way ahead of its time in terms of introducing a lot of revolutionary concepts into CCG gaming (asymetrical sides, economics, bluffing, betting) and it suffered as a result of Magic being so much simpler, accesible, and frankly shallower.  Now, in 2005, the art looks hopelessly dated but there still isn't anything in the CCG market that approaches the ingenuity of this game.

Fun game, but the mechanics can be a little tricky to pick up on for non-computer people or folks completely unfamiliar with the cyberpunk genre...even though the game theme and mechanics don't much represent reality, I think they'll be a little more intuitive if you have a computer/programming background. It's easier for me (a programmer) to translate the game's terms ("Data fort protected by ice") into something comparable to real life (database behind a firewall/IDS) than it is for my wife (an English major).

Or at least that's my theory, and I'm sticking to it.

RATING: 7
An asymmetric game between Corporation and Runner (decker, hacker) which does a fantastic job capturing the feel of that sort of contest (as it tends to be portrayed in cyberpunk, [i]Shadowrun[/i], etc.) Very, very neat.

It's a CCG, but starter-deck vs. starter-deck works startlingly well. (And even if you get bitten by the "want more cards" bug, you can pick up lots of commons on the cheap.)

If playing with constructed decks rather than random ones, the big problem I see is that bits and card-draws are a standin for "time". Decks which include more card-draw and (especially!) bit-generation power will tend to develop faster and stomp on decks with less of those (fairly generic, strategy-wise) cards. If maintaining a set of decks for people to play with, make sure to keep them roughly on-par with each other in that regard, or the game becomes a lot less fun. If doing competitive deck-building (not actually my first choice for this game), it looks like [url=http://boardgame.geekdo.com/thread/167172]Neal's Draconian Banned List[/url] might help solve this? (By banning many of the generic, highly-effective bit-generating cards.)

As much as I enjoy the Android universe, however, I will always be partial to the original Netrunner's art and graphic design. The narrative they created with the art and flavor text was an essential part of the original's appeal.

One of the better CCGs out there, almost to its detriment, actually. The game played so well out the starter boxes, that it made collecting the whole set less important.

RATING: 9
The most heavily thematic CCG ever, no wonder it is a cult classic.  The more I play it, the more I feel that this is one of the most underrated games ever published.   Loaded with cyberpunk jargon, it must have been doomed to fail since the audience for this is but a fraction of the fantasy crowd that flocked to Magic The Gathering.  However, there is no shortage of genius in Garfield's design here.  Drawing cards and replenishing funds are up to the player, at the expense of actions, rather than replenishing every round.  Totally asymmetric, drenched in theme, and amazingly variable straight out of the box, with some thrilling surprise endings.  It's not an expensive game, either.   One starter has dozens of plays in it, no boosters necessary - no collecting, no deck-building - just play.  Intense, fun, mind-blowing - a top choice for 2 players.  Jack in and cypher some black ice.

Since I'm trying to review every game I've played, I'm trying to harken back to my teenage days and remember this one.  I definitely remember liking it.  Being disappointed it could only be played with 2 people.  And wishing they'd have come out with more cards.  Other than that, it's all a blur.  God, imagine how little I'd remember if I was one of the cool kids and got wasted on drugs and alcohol.

Love this game.  There are no bad guys or good guys, just misguided ones with different agendas. The artwork is awesome, and the game play is more challenging than MTG.

Stumbled through the rules and got in about 4 plays last night. This game is EXACTLY what I'm looking for in a CCG when I consider my gaming preferences right now. Specifically, the game plays out of the box. That's what I wanted the most, and that's exactly what the game does.

Otherwise there's some other really interesting parts of Netrunner. The theme exists, and is integrated throughout the game. The art, dedicated roles of runner and corp, the strategies that each player must entail to play well all contribute to the feel of the game. It's easily the most thematic ccg I've come across.

Simply put the best CCG ever made. One reason it didn't sell so well was because it was playable straight out of the box, with no booster packs added.

RATING: 6
[Collectible Card Game, Cyberpunk, Science Fiction, Asymmetric] {2P:6} {Three dual starters, a dozen boosters} Perhaps the best "other" CCG that Wizards of the Coast has ever put out (note they bought Legend of the Five Rings, they didn't develop it). Netrunner was interesting in that one player was the Corporation, trying to keep the other player, the Netrunner, out of its systems. Had some balance problems, and died a quick death. The balance problems stemmed more from the asymmetric style of play that was a bit more complex than many CCGers had the patience for. It was like learning two games. It was also like buying two games right off the bat (the dual starters cost the same as, well, almost two starters). Finally, deckbuilding wasn't as intersting as its famous rock star older cousin, Magic: the Gathering, since the theme and gameplay didn't support it. Thus, Netrunner was a commercial flop. That was too bad, as Netrunner had very thematic, innovative gameplay that became more interesting as you played it more. The problem was that as you played it more, the play became a bit monotonous as there were only two ways for each side to win. The Corp either flatlined the runner by dealing damage (unlikely) or won by amassing agenda. The runner won by running the Corp out of cards (unlikely) or by amassing agendas. I'm still a fan of the idea and the theme, but never got into the game due to the disinterest of everyone else, and missed the two expansions. (Good thing, as I hear Proteus was even more unbalancing.) Oh well, something to revisit at some point. I think Netrunner, out of the box, would hold up well alongside many of the current-day 2P German games.

RATING: 9
Great asymmetrical CCG. Designed by Richard Garfield, the same guy who designed Magic: the Gathering.  Yet it's one of the few CCGs that is not a ripoff of Magic: the Gathering.  Unlike many CCGs, it's playable using just starters, but the game is unfortunately out of print.

I need to dig this one out again sometime soon.

Very good collectible card-game tying into the CYBERPUNK RPG simulating futuristic computer hackers and the corporations trying to shut them out.  The rules mechanics allowed for phaseless freedom of actions and the logical flow of play had the regularity of logical subroutines in a computer program.
Sadly, this good game was "lost in the shuffle" of collectible card-game mania of the time, but was re-issued in a new edition as Android:Netrunner and is very popular now.

My rating could climb higher, but my interest in spending time creating decks is minimal if existant at all.  I have, however, had fun playing with prepared decks of my brother's and I do see the genius in the design.

actualmente voltei a jogar netrunner (é fácil fazer proxies com qualidade) e o android ainda vai demorar muito a chegar aos calcanhares do original.
o grande problema deste jogo reside na discussão acerca do limite de cópias: limitando o número, runner fica a perder, sem limite, permite combos abusivos que vão variando conforme o ambiente onde se joga e como tal, estraga um pouco o jogo... se tivessem saído mais expansões obviamente este problema não se punha, porque saíam cartas para controlar os combos dominantes...

Large box of well over a thousand alphabetized cards from all the sets...bought from a retail coin & collectible shop for a mere $3...and then returned 10 months later and bought the binder of 400 uncommons and rares that I left behind the first time for $5. Full set of v1.0, save two cards.

The cards are functional, and the artwork on some cards is better than others, but nothing to really make you stop and take notice.   The cards are perfectly functional and easy to read, and although the rulebook is thick, there really needed to be a good quickplay summary and reference guide.  The gameplay is definitely interesting and unique.

A sign of a great game is having too many things that you want to do and not enough cash/actions to do them. This is a great game. Lots of bluffing too. Plays better out of the box than constructed, which is the opposite of most CCGs.

An interesting game with a lot of potential that never caught hold with my circle of friends back in the day.  Part of that was due to the CCG format and competition for limited funds with Magic: The Gathering.  Part was the comparatively complicated rules that not everyone had the patience to wade through.  Part was the asymmetric aspect since it forced people to make more decks.

It sounds like Android: Netrunner addresses a lot of the shortcomings of this version, but I think that ship has sailed for me.

I played this a lot when it first came out and completely loved it, and was lucky enough to pick up a BOX of decks for a song when WotC stopped supporting it, for closed box games (I've never seen the Proteus expansion).

It would definitely be a 10 if it wasn't for the CCG aspect. I always thought virtual games using a point-buy system to select from the entire card palette would be the best evolution for this.

Would love to play regularly, but lack local opponents.

Garfield's best CCG.  He cut his teeth on [thing=463][i]Magic[/i][/thing], then over-complicated things with [thing=2122][i]Jyhad[/i][/thing]—and got it just right with this one.  We play a Very Good multi-player variant ([url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/12624/big-selloutdoc]The Big Sellout[/url]) where each Corp has a pet Runner in their employ; all Corps take their turn simultaneously, then all Runners go.  We've played games with up to 8 people (4 Corp-Runner teams).  The most fun I've ever had with a CCG, hands down.  

SUPERDELUXE ADDED BONUS FEATURE!!!:  

It plays perfectly fine with unmodified starter decks.

[imageid=1986608 original]
UPDATE:  [gameid=39339] ≠  [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer]Neuromancer[/url]

Unforntunately the [thing=124742]reboot[/thing] has lost the soul of the thing, with a [thing=39339]shoe-horned IP[/thing] inspired by Golden Age science fiction (missing entirely any New Wave or Cyberpunk sensibilities) and art & ethos lacking any real balls, grime or dehumanizing awfulness.  I get the impression it's written & drawn by kids who don't know from Cyberpunk literature, having only barely tasted the trappings by sucking regurgitated anime from sippy cups.*

Of course the original is dated—[i]because now we live in that world[/i], having ignored the cautionary tales.  We are all of us junkies at Disneyland, putting digital fixes ahead of outrage at unbridled corporate power, more than happy to trade privacy for convenience.  We willingly carry surveillance devices on us at all times, even into bed- and bathrooms, much to our government's delight.  Our most private lives are now blatant commodities.  I could go on and on...

[COLOR=#B8B8B8][size=7]data mining - death by drones - cryptocurrency bubbles - realtime genocides - anthropogenic climate change - election hacking - blurg - blurgety-blurg[/size][/COLOR]

ANYWAY

The original's the best—authentic and faithful to the [thing=47011]originating theme[/thing] in both vibe and mechanics.  It really makes me feel like a massive multinational swatting at the flies that dare rise from the muck... or a slum-bound addict with a used cyberdeck, some MIL-SPEC ICEbreakers and a death wish.

[microbadge=10253]

(Untold numbers of plays between 1996 & BGG)

Set includes the fabled porno-POGs:

[q=Who the hell]I fell into the habit of using POGs as counters for collectible card games as the two fads came to prominence—peaking and subsiding—around the same time in the mid-'90s.  They were cheap, plentiful, and many of them were decorated with seemingly random, head-scratching "art".  This appealed a great deal to me.

I then came into possession of a "Milkcap Maker", a device that allowed one to affix any image onto stickered slugs... and the infamous "porno-POGs" were born, as well as the "World's Busiest POG" which contained more genitalia, mouths and hands on one POG than anyone thought possible at the time.

As of the date of writing (July 2012) we still use the POGs as counters and creatures in [thing=463][/thing] and other games where a proxy bit is called for; they reside on the primary game shelf in a cigar box, well worn, well loved and still a part of most games though there are better, prettier options available.  (The porno-POGs, however, remain hidden away in my old [i]Netrunner[/i] collection as a secret shame—the collision of the Milkcap Maker and several years of [i]Club International[/i] magazine a psychic boobytrap to be sprung by my estate holders upon my demise.)[/q]
[size=7]*I fully understand that I am shouting into an eviscerating whirlwind on this one—the reboot is immensely popular, very easily eclipsing the original in market penetration and number of happy players.  For that I am truly glad—the base engine is a terrific game that deserves to be popular and enjoyed—but as a humble student of Cyberpunk literature I find the reskin to be weak sauce.  It's a sadly attenuated 6th-gen afterimage that vanishes upon blinking.**[/size]

Someone brought this to a games night and....this kind of game is the worst possible thing to bring to a games night. It has a big rule book, a steep learning curve, and pays back repeat play. We played once and there was a lot of, "Oh I have a card that lets me do X" and "Oh did you forget that ICE breaking requires blah and then your brain melts unless you have foo?"

Based on that one play, it was hard for me to say why this would be better/worse than the myriad other CCGs out there.

The theme was more interesting than most but that's about all I could based on my single play and the 5-minute rules explanation I had beforehand.

Netrunner is the closest I’ve come in a game to living the theme. Perhaps it helps that I hack computers anyway; but it really does work. It helps if you’re into Gibson, or if you’ve tapped into any of the cyberpunk ethos that he conjured. If you played Cyberpunk 2020, or any other Talsorian-style cyberpunk, that’s only a bonus. Netrunner is based in that world, but that world is really only a second-generation Mirrorshades world, so it’s all really the same thing. Cyberpunk is a remarkably cohesive worldview, probably because the modern phenomena that inflected it were acting on such an insular group to begin with.


I’m not saying that if you don’t like computers, or if you don’t like the idea of hacking, or if you don’t like cyberpunk or (to a significantly lesser degree) tech-noir, then you won’t like Netrunner. You might well. But this game really feeds off its theme. Playing it without some idea of what it’s trying to represent, both the worldview and the physical and electronic reality, would be like a wholly spiritual being playing Agricola: what is this ‘feeding’? what is ‘starvation’? what is ‘warmth’? and why do we care about [i]any[/i] of this?


In cyberpunk, and so in Netrunner, the world is divided between two poles, with the usual blind herd of humanity making up an entirely unsignificant middle. For anybody’s purposes, all that exist are the corporations and the runners, the computer hackers—except in this world, if you’re a hacker, you’re a cracker. It’s a computer war.

But for the runners, the corporations—and I’ll call them the Corp from now on—would have only each other to deal with: the usual megaconglomerates slowly metastasizing into each other the world over, claiming a continent here, a subcontinent there. If there are countries, nobody cares. There are people, and they live in the world of the Corp. I’ll quote from [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2]System Shock 2[/url], for those who care: “All developed by TriOptimum Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.” That’s about right.

There are probably other corps. But for the runners—and, again, I’ll just refer to the Runner from now on—there is only one Corp. Wars happen on other continents, but really everybody has everything sewn up now. So you don’t get much in the way of Corp versus Corp, because that’s not the narrative, and nobody would care anyway. If you play the official multiplayer variant, you’ll get into that, but even so it’s more of a local thing, and you’ll all be playing generally the same type of corp.


The narrative in Netrunner is Runner versus Corp. Not the other way around, and that’s a big deal.

The Corp is there. Just there. It sits, and it screws the people. It makes money, it sells a sheeple lifestyle, it runs the world.

The Runner, on the other hand, is out to live his own kind of life, with the power to choose. And in this world, that means not working for the Man, and that means taking power back from the Corp. Because all power flows from the Corp now. The world has been taken away, and the Runner takes it back. You’re not helping the people, but you’re at least helping yourself.

As the Corp, you barely even respond to the Runner. You mitigate the Runner, you try to divert him and deflect him and discourage him. Elephants don’t chase flies. Sometimes you slap him, but mostly you just outspend him, and it never takes more than your pocket change.

The Runner, on the other hand, has only a little more than pocket change to maintain his own rig: his programs, his shields, his links—everything he needs to tap-dance his way through security and come out the other side clean, with information; because you may as well spend information as spend money in a world like this.


So much for the ethos of the game.

If anybody’s still reading, I’ll talk about how the game pulls all this off now.

[color=#777777]You should assume that almost all, possibly all, of this applies to A:N as well in all important respects; though I won’t even mention the world of you-know-where in the same sentence as the Sprawl, and I’m not a fan of factioning out the cards.[/color]


As the Runner, resources (and this is a Term in the game, but I’m not using it that way here) are not on your side. You’re a one-man army of broke.

As the Corp, time is not on your side. You are a yakuza with committees, and the PR team to make up for it.


I’ll be describing the point of the game from the point of view of the Corp, mostly, because if you haven’t picked up on it already, this world isn’t just defined in terms of the Corp, it [i]is[/i] the Corp. Even hacking out a little room for your own life as the Runner just means transferring power from one Corp to another and then back again on a different day, living in the little holes where the Corp isn’t sitting. You don’t become an Information God, you don’t run anything, you don’t run anybody. You just take your cut when the information changes hands. And no matter who gets the information, they’ll always end up squeezing you with it in the end, because they made the world, and the world squeezes everybody.


As the Corp, you run the world, or at least most of your own world—say, your continent, for starters. You have the usual tricks at your disposal—the PR campaigns that bring in the money by the accountful, the celebrities that lead the masses where you want them to go—but those are (and you already knew I was going to say this) means to your end.

Your end, of course, is doing something with what you’ve got. Because you aren’t the only people with the same idea (your world is only big enough for one Corp, but the world at large has several), you have an even better excuse for beefing up your own private army, for investing in new technologies, for protecting what you’ve got.

You do all this by advancing your own agendas. In game, what this means is that you’ll be laying your cards face-down: either as data forts, or as ICE (intrusion countermeasures electronics: you can thank Gibson for that one).

Your data fort holds what you’re working on: and your ICE shields that fort against the outside. The fort contains the information about your projects, about your operations (another game Term: I’m using it wrong here), about how you’re turning the screws in the world now.


As the Runner, that’s your target. And so you run (as they call it) on data forts, trying to skip into one, get the information, and make a living by increasing other people’s knowledge, not that you care.

Agendas can vary in value: from 1 point to 7 (one that I know of; but it’s worth only 3 points to the Runner). Values of 1–3 are frequent. 7 points wins you the game.

As the Corp, you’ll want to spend money to advance your agendas: Use one of your 3 actions to place 1 bit (currency) on your agenda, and it’s 1 point closer to being realized. But to complete a (say) 3-point agenda may cost 5 points of advancement. That will take you a couple turns of advancement, and all the while the Runner (who gets 4 actions to your 3) will be trying to run through your ICE to steal that agenda: If he accesses it, he gets it, and you lose all the work you’ve put into it.

So you’ll want to save back enough money to rez (activate) whatever ICE you’ve put on your data fort.

When the Runner makes a run on your fort, he’ll approach each piece of ICE; when he does, you can choose to rez it or let him pass it. Your ICE comes in various types (three, broadly), and he’ll have breakers (ICE-breaking programs) to match, if he can afford them yet.

If the Runner bumps up against a piece of ICE he can’t break (he doesn’t have the right kind of breaker, or he can’t pay to boost its strength high enough to pass your high-level ICE, or he isn’t bit-rich enough to pay to break a subroutine on your piece of ICE that [say] ends his run), then he’ll be forced to jack out, after taking whatever (if any) damage the current piece of ICE does to him: meat (body) damage, net (system) damage, or brain (yeah) damage. Brain damage is the worst: He’ll permanently lose 1 to his maximum hand size. And every time he takes any damage, he’ll lose a random card from his hand.

As to the cards, he’s shy; and you wish you were. You get 3 actions to the Runner’s 4, but at the beginning of every one of your turns, you’ll have a forced draw: a new card in your hand whether you want one or not. You’ll discard down to 5 at the end of your turn; so will the Runner. And when your deck runs out, the Runner wins: You couldn’t get your agendas going in time, and he delayed you until your projects were untimely and uneffective. You’re all sorts of screwed for this week.

Conversely, if the Runner’s cards in hand ever go below 0, he dies. Which is why you want to damage him if you can.

Which is why you have to trace him.

When you trace the Runner, you’ll generally be trying to put a tag on him: to get a digital handle on where and what he is, some sort of electronic voodoo doll whereby you can reach out and cut him off from his human assets, from his infrastructure, and sometimes even follow him right back down the lines and overload his system: You can do 5 meat damage with a single card if he hasn’t got the shields to prevent it.

Your data forts are more than just the ones you create, though: the subsidiary data forts, that contain the information for your agendas, or the nodes that you use to screw around with the world in helpful ways.

No, your data forts also include your primary data forts: your HQ (hand), your R&D (draw pile), and your archives (discards). The Runner can run on these at will; and you can protect them with ICE. And because every turn you’ll be forced to start by drawing the top card of R&D, the Runner knows that every time his turn comes around, you have a new card on top of R&D. If he makes a successful run on R&D, then he can steal it (an agenda) or trash it (a node, by paying its trash cost). And you may be short on ICE, and have a whole hand full of agendas: and of course he could also be making runs on HQ.

So if you’re short on ICE, where do you put it? Put it in front of your hand, and he’ll know you have something there—[i]and[/i], until you get another piece of ICE, he’ll run on your R&D as often as he hits cards he can bleed off the top.


Netrunner is about the mind game. You may not know your opponent’s deck, but you know the kind of deck he could have, and you know what things are out there.

• Is the Corp saving up money because he’s going to install an agenda, then hire some Project Consultants (pay 12 bits to add 4 advancement counters at once to an advanceable card)?
• Or is he trying to stock up because his hand is full of agendas and the only ICE he could put out is too expensive for him to rez?
• Either way, does that mean he has agendas in hand, or is he just stocking up because he’s got shit and is biding his time, planning to be rich when the agendas start flowing in?
• If you pull HQ a few times and get nothing, should you start running on R&D, or start racing your deck to get Library Search, which will let you draw 2 additional cards from R&D?
• If he’s advancing an installed card (all Corp cards are installed face-down) high, say 5 counters, is he going for Project Babylon (scores additional agenda points for additional counters), a Subsidiary Branch (1 agenda point; give the Corp an additional action for the rest of the game), or Vacant Soulkiller (1 point of brain damage for every advancement counter)?

The uncertainty is incredibly tense. And the best part is that it’s not just uncertainty, it’s uncertainty that is streaked with tells. The whole game, your opponent has been telling you what he’s been doing. The way he plays, whether he ICEd HQ rather than R&D, whether he’s been discarding, how many bits you had when he installed something in his data fort:

All of it is telling you things. It’s not a closed book, but it’s a book half full of lies. And what you’re giving him to watch is exactly the same thing:
• What are you saving bits for? Do you have the breakers you need, and are waiting to do a triple-install and then the One Big Run?
• Are you waiting until you can pull together an Emergency Self-Construct, to prevent the damage his trap card (if it is) might do you?
• What about those concealed resources (all your other cards, including your resources, are face-up, but not your hidden resources): Are they bit-generating cards, or tag avoiders?
• Are you really poor? Or do you have a Lucidrine Booster Drug stuffed down your pocket?

Netrunner is a game about reading your opponent. Every time you get a card, every time you play a card, every time you don’t play a card, every time you discard—every time you take a bit: You’re feeding your opponent a long, misdirecting string of information. It’s not about lacking information for either side: It’s about filtering out the lies, the ploys, the hopeless bluffs from the information you’re getting.


If I didn’t make it crystal-clear: There are two games in this. The rules aren’t even the same.

The Corp has his own ruleset, he installs his cards face-down, and he advances agendas, operates nodes, and rezzes ICE. He manages data forts, and he protects his cards. He makes the safe plays, the heavy plays; and when he’s neither safe nor heavy, he lies about it, and makes it happen as soon as he can.

The Runner has his own ruleset, he installs his cards face-up, and he runs on data forts and their contents. He finds the weak data forts and exploits them while he builds up a system that can take the rest of them. He makes the crazy play, the balls-to-the-wall run with a single for-shit wall breaker and 3 bits.


When I lose a game of Netrunner, it’s rarely because the cards made me lose: because I couldn’t draw breakers, or because I drew a starting hand full of agendas.

It’s because I got lied to.

It’s because my opponent drew a starting hand full of agendas, and didn’t draw for ICE. He just sat there and started building up bits like he had nothing better to do. It’s because he had no breakers, and called my bluff on the Liche (extremely high-level ICE) I couldn’t rez.

It’s like playing poker for your life.

Man, I love this game.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

I've thought about picking up some Netrunner cards for a while, so when they popped up in a math trade, I bit. And I won! Yay!

Reading the rules immediately intrigued me, but I had a really hard time putting them together in my head, even after 2 reads. One play brought it mostly together. Surprisingly, Brooke immediately offered to play it again with me. She said she just wanted to see more of the cards in action. Neat. I wanted to move on to another game, though, because the unplayed backlog is starting to back up.

We'll play again soon. I think I'll really, really like this game.

Ideal Players: 2

Description: One player plays a cyberpunk megacorp, while the other plays a renegade hacker. The hacker tries to break in and steal the megacorp's plans before it can finish them.

Pro: Completely different feel as the runner or the corp. The mechanics used by each are appropriate to their side. Every game tells a different story. Beautiful art. The game is best with two starter decks.

Con: Requires counters that aren't included (preferably player mats, too). The game gets unbalanced if decks are tweaked. Needs a point-based system to allow balanced deck building. Would have been better if it weren't a CCG.

A very clever and innovative CDG.  I missed this wave twice.  First when it was out, then when I could have whold sets of starter decks for $5.  Sigh.  Anyway, great asymetry built in.  Deck building seems pointless since the style of play between the two players is so different.  Richard Garfield deserves his legend status for creating the Magic phenom, but he deserves respect as a notable game designer for Netrunner.

Still preliminary rating after 7 plays.  Starter decks don't give you a full picture of this CCG and its true potential...

Generally I don't care about CCGs and I'm not going to enter any information about them on bgg, but Netrunner is THE exception.  This game seems great - both in mechanical and climatic sense.  When playing NR you are just immersed in the cyberpunk world envisioned in the game.

I haven't experienced this whole 'tournaments and highly specialized/tuned/optimized decks' stuff and I'm NOT going to.  I just want to slowly explore and enjoy the game with my co-players, buying some cards every now and then, *definitely* not aiming at constructing killer tournament decks.

-0.5 for being CCG, not LCG.

A game completely built on the theme, like most good games are, and I really dig the theme great stuff, kinda like Matrix meets Blade Runner (personally not familiar with Cyberpunk 2020). This was an innovative little game for the time and an excellent 2 player game by any measure, board, card, etc. I waited a long time to play/get this due to the OOP status and that can often lead to slight or moderate disappointment, not this time I'm happy to report. 

Some very cool mechanics here that I have not seen anywhere else, building dataforts, protecting them with ICE (software firewalls), Runner jacks IN and OUT of the "NET" to try and break into the forts but must PASS the ICE, awesome stuff. Rules are a little tricky especially around the Icebreakers and the Run (check threads I posted for clarification) but overall very low rules overhead, easy to learn, mostly intuitive thanks to the theme and after 3 games or so there is no look up and games flow awesome. 

Mostly a tactical game where reacting to what the other player is doing and what cards you get is key. There is some planning necessary though and calculations as well to make sure your playing efficiently. Decisions can be straightforward at times (maybe half) but always remain interesting and important.  

Deckbuilding not really necessary which suits me though having more cards does mean changing your cards or even your whole deck sometimes just for variety. Luck is of course a factor but inline with the length of the game and goes together nicely with the high element of BLUFF also in the game. 

Play is mostly fast and furious, you only have 3 or 4 actions and these get used up really quick so no downtime, turns are very fast. Games should last anywhere from 20 minutes to maybe 40 tops depending on how many and how fast the Agendas come out.  Games are FUN, usually tense, and I find myself 'absorbed' in the theme while playing. Great assymetry where both sides have very different play and objectives and the game has that addictive quality of leaving you just wanting to play one more time. 

Note: I found the Runner deck I got not quite strong enough to compete and once I tweaked it (added/removed 6 cards only) AND understood the rules fully the game plays awesome. Runner needs to have good bit generation, a few good Icebreakers and aggressive play to succeed, rules not understood can throw off the game quite a bit.  

TIDBIT - Currently playing with one small houserule, any one Agenda can only be advanced TWICE on one turn. Just helps the Runner a little as some Agendas only have a 3 difficulty which make them too easy to score with regular rule. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 -> 9  Just played a very exciting game where the runner was way behind but made two successful runs to tie it up 5 to 5. As the Corp I played yet another piece of ICE on the datafort and put one more Agenda in it, that would decide the game. VERY tense, the Runner made not one but TWO runs on the fort and it all came down to one die roll! Session report with image of game state:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5347568

Cyberpunk-themed CCG that saw remarkably few cards made before the game became defunct. I have played a couple times over the internet using a tool called LackeyCCG and the Netrunner plugin available for it, which gives you all the card art. 

The rules differ slightly between the Runner and Corp player, but I like how the mechanics really mesh well with the theme. 

...and now about to be superseded by the actually readily available Android: Netrunner! Yessssss.

This game is fun for about 2 plays before the bluffing aspect is over with and it's no fun any more.  You would really need a bunch of cards to switch out to make it at least bearable, but even then it just gets really obvious and dull.

RATING: 8
Gives a real Collectible Card Game feel, as opposed to Blue Moon or Scarab Lords: the variety of special powers, the fact that cards mostly stay in place in order to create a "machine" all help.

The rules are not very complicated or long, despite a 60-page rulebook!  They are quite verbose, which does not help, and information is sometimes buried in a long paragraph, but they're quite manageable.

The "density" of thinking is smaller than in Race for the Galaxy.  For instance, getting 1 bit as an action is not as demanding as drawing cards in Race and choosing one or more of them.  However, after a few games, these simple actions are chosen and performed quickly, which leaves more time for harder thinking.  Furthermore, little mistakes can have a huge impact (what?  I forgot I could easily remove this tag, and now I don't have enough money to do a run!!); but such mistakes tend to disappear after a few games.

There is a kind of "poker feel" to the game.  Any information that your opponent gives you can be very useful.  For instance, it's better not to let the other know that you have bad cards, so show that you're thinking of installing a card in a site (it may be an Agenda), to say that you can't find any Agenda in R&D, etc.  And you can give away a lot of information by checking a card and backtracking your actions so that you get more bits: it may mean that the card is quite expensive to rez...

The variety of available tactics and strategies seems to evolve slower than in Race, over the course of a game: I may be wrong, but it seems to me that it's less common to shift one's strategy to something else.   But maybe I only feel like this because I don't yet know all the possibilities offered by the decks.

Another, related point is that strategies seem simpler: I can put myself in a "mode", where I try to get more money (bits), more cards, or try to do as many runs as possible.  In Race, I would be imagining variations over my current strategy almost at every draw of a new card.

All in all, I thus find myself thinking deeply less often than in Race for the Galaxy.  But Netrunner is still a game that keeps my brain quite busy (more than in Commands and Colors: Ancients, more than in Dominion, more than in Blue Moon and Scarab Lords).

The game is very cutthroat, though: each player has to attack the other one (for instance by performing runs, for the Runner, or by installing ICEs or upgrades, for the Corp).  Interactivity is thus high, compared to Race for the Galaxy.  This is enjoyable.

Memory plays a role, which makes it one of the rare games in my collection that does significantly involve memory (Dominion being one of them).  In fact, the Runner has the possibility, sometimes, to see face down cards:  it is useful to remember them.

As the Runner, I was at first slightly bored when waiting for the Corp to install Agendas.  But this was because I did not yet recognize the urgency of setting up ICE breakers and gathering money for a quick raid when an Agenda appears, or the opportunities offered by doing runs on R&D.  Or because the player who played the Corp did not know how important it was to cycle through her deck in order to score Agendas as fast as possible.

That said, the surprise brought about by hidden Corp card is enjoyable.  The players can take risks.  They can feel the pressure of having little ICE (for the Corp), or having to fight a lot of it (for the Runner).  The variety of card powers brings in a lot of tactical options.  The game is quite cutthroat, with its traps (Node Upgrades), with the relatively large impact of small mistakes, or of wise risk taking.

Basically Tron in card game format.  I'm especially liking it because once you have a starter deck or two, you're totally set.  Sure, there are strategies to chase after and I'm sure you can make better decks by putting together combos and having multiples of a number of cards in a tightly-knit theme if you so choose, but you also have to chase after those cards and spend more money to go that route, which I am totally unwilling to do.  A great game of traps and sticking your hand in the virtual cookie jar, hoping big brother isn't watching, or at least that you can run away fast enough if he is. Not difficult to find on the cheap and plays fast, lending itself to multiple plays in one sitting.  Raised rating to 8

Cyberpunk theme: fun. Great card art: awesome. Playing a weenie rush deck versus a wall deck in every single game: no thank you.

At first, it seemed like there were some good ideas here. But the more cards we had access to, and the more games of it we played, the clearer it became that the basic architecture of every game was going to be exactly the same. That's an absolute game-killer for a CCG.

This was an amazing CCG.  The only problem was that it lacked the ability to be played in large groups (unlike Magic:TG).  It was also kind of complicated at first.

An eclectic CCG that ran during the 90's. Very fun to play but expansions towards the end of its production are difficult to come by and are thought to "break" some parts of the game.

RATING: 9.5
Assymetric nature of the game (requiring different styles of play from the Corp and the Runner) makes NetRunner very interesting and challenging.

Plays very well out of a standard double starter deck. Unfortunately no longer available, except on ebay.

Rules are good, but make sure you get Rob's Netrunner Rules Outline (http://www.bitblaster.com/l2k/nr/easystart.html) since it makes the game alot easier to get into, and the FAQ and playmats here at BGG.

My favourite 2 player game. We play with 2 starter decks (2 Corp decks plus 2 Runner decks) without deck construction.

CCG with bluffing, decision-making & theme.  An extremely well-balanced game where opposing sides (Net Runner vs Corporation) have different decks (containing cards that only function for one side) & different goals.  I was suprised to see that the 3 player variant was just as fun and balanced.  Two runners vs the corp., corp. gets 1 extra action point.

A fantastic card game. I had a meager collection for a number of years and one of my friends would build a runner deck and play against my corp deck. We never played anyone else. He stopped coming around so I sold the lot on eBay for 40 bucks. I regretted it later so badly. I am so looking forward to the LCG reimpliment!

The only CCG that I ever got into and one of my favourite games.  Currently (as of 2011) playing this game after years and years of neglect.

As mentioned by many posters, the game does play very well with a single starter deck (add maybe 3-5 boosters for variety after your first few games).  

Excellent integration of game mechanics and theme.  Brilliant design.

Looking for rares to complete my set (1.0, 2.1 and 2.2).    

Let me know if you're interested in trading, I've completely inventoried my collection (as of May 2011).

The most underrated CCG ever. Great gameplay of 2 very different sides but superbly balanced. It's only drawback (from the CCG point of view) was that you didn't need to collect it to make it a great game. A starter or two was enough. Now coming back with a revised setting from FFG!

Would love to trade, but preferably sell. Cards in great shape, I think. I have them in a card box (maybe 2), some are open but in original boxes. They have been kept well (dry/cool) but they've been packed away in those card boxes since I opened the wrappers of the card packs... yes, I mean since they actually sold them in stores.
Pictures of all coming soon (I am in process of moving to TX).

Netrunner is a very clever CCG. Were I into cyberpunk or CCGs in general, then I'd definitely rate it higher, since the theme is very well implemented and the game would only be enhanced by the additional layer of deck construction. My current rating is essentially for playing with starter decks straight up.

The game's jargon definitely presents a learning curve, and the payoff for it seems to be mostly in the theme rather than the depth of the game. Thus, if you're not into the theme, then it will just feel like a lot of obnoxious obfuscation of a game that's more straightforward than it seems. For a thematic, asymmetric game with hidden information, [boardgame=18833][/boardgame] is vastly easier to explain and offers only marginally less sophisticated gameplay.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Netrunner is a fantastic CCG that never really got a chance to succeed.  It was pretty unique with its asymmetrical setup and asymmetrical balance, and I can see how that turned some people off.  However, the theme was great, and there was a great resource management aspect, as the players had two different resources: money and cards.  There were also several different types of decks you could make, and the game was a blast to play.

Some people will have a problem with the game's imbalance.  The corporation will win the majority of the games, but you really should play the game in pairs, where each player plays the corp and runner once each.  This is a great out of print CCG to pick up, as the cards aren't that expensive, and you can have fun playing with only a small investment.  Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My initial experience with this game was poor (me not being a magic player and the rules going right over my head), but subsequent plays have shown me there's a good game to be had here. Good tension for the Corporate player to win early ... long games favor the Runner. Well-themed.

The best collectible card game I've played, from an actual gaming experience. It's not really collectable in the same ways as other CCGs, which is probably why it ultimately failed commercially - it was too well balanced for much extra card-buying to really be justified. Anyway, a wonderful interplay between two massively unbalanced sides (a lumbering, ruthless corporation vs. a nimble and resourceful hacker), with great cyberpunk flavor.

My second favorite CCG. Based on my favorite of the cyberpunk RPGs (system-wise), the game fleshes out an interesting world through the use of bold, pretty (or appropriately dingy) artwork. The game plays out almost like a story, with the Corporation doing something and the characters from the Streets reacting. Good gameplay, but could be a notch better.

RATING: 6
Collectible card game for two players where one player is a Corporation trying to score agenda points and the other player is a "Net runner" trying to intercept the agenda. The corporate player moves toward their goal by setting agenda, other nodes and upgrades in corporate "data fonts" (i.e. placing the correspondent cards on the table) with more or less protective code in front of them (the so called "ice"); and the runner must gather and use hardware, resources and programs (different cards with actions to bring resources or damage the "ice") to hack into the Corporation data system.

The gameplay is of course as asymmetric as it can get, with different cards (that never get mixed) and turn sequences for each player, but overall it depends on the amount of protection laid in front of the corporate player's important cards and the way the runner can crack it. This means the game can be very luck-driven, since the Corporation can score lots of agenda before the runner can even get one single program running. Anyway, Netrunner is entertaining despite the cyberpunk-tinged jargon galore in the rulebook: players get used to it fairly quickly and the game system is clean enough.

Found out about it very late, so hard to get many plays in (lack of cards, or people with cards), but I really liked the theme and how the game is played, which was conceptually unique as well as reinforcing the theme. Deckbuilding aspect seemed like it could be strong as well. Hard to tell if it would hold up over time, though, and this is only from playing with a very limited set of cards.

I've only played with the starter packs and never felt I needed anything more. A wonderful 2 player game for gamers. Rules complexity is high and a barrier to entry, but if you can get an opponent into it with you, there's a wonderful assymetric struggle in store. There's bluff, there's surprise, there's multiple approaches, there's the luck of the cards, there's the hard decisions each turn on where and what to invest in. Thumbs up.

Remarkable design, and incredibly addictive. Of the half-dozen or so CCGs I've played, this is hands down my favorite. The way the two factions (corp and runner) play off of each other is genius.

Runner cards are played face up, corp cards are played face down. The runner has to reveal or guess what the corp is hiding, stealing cards that are advantageous and avoiding ones that are harmful. Bluffing is a big part of this game!

One of the pricier dead CCGs, but you can still find great deals on eBay once in awhile. Decks are sold in double-packs (one corp, one runner). Since this game plays great out of the deck, all you need is one double-pack to start playing!

Finally.. I found it.  I knew I had the booster pack at my father's house, and just today I went and picked it up.  I used to play this at the pub in england with friends, albeit in a quiet setting, and I havent' played it in years.   I re-read the rules and it all came back -- 1996 and cyberpunk.  It's a great game in a niche time capsule.  Can't wait to play it once again, and my numeric rating is set to reflect this.

Update:  I forgot how much I loved this game.  It's complex and it's going to take a while under both players are in full comprehension of the correct rules, AND it's a niche theme in 'Cyberpunk', but that stuff's my bag.  I can't stress enough how important it is to play with the CORRECT rules, without them a fine balance is lost.  Unfortunately, the given manual is very unintuitive, and makes learning the game a longer chore than it need be.  If you're new to the genre (aka, yer not a techie), or you aren't big on card games (the collectable aspect can be ignored), or you can't stand complex rules then this isn't for you.

With that said, I'd venture to say that some of those people who have ranked this game below 5 have yet to play 'correctly', as the balance is there.  Others may cite the game's faults: it suffers from players prone to Analysis Paralysis, it's complicated as hell, an interest in the subject matter is pretty much required, and stumbling your way through 'correct' play can be cumbersome and daunting.  There are plenty of decisions to be made- you might want to bring a sand timer to the table.. no, seriously.

If you are ever lucky enough to grab a starter set with both a corporate and runner deck, be sure to pick it up.  It's all you'll need.  It's a 'collectable card game' by nature of the beast, but it's good right out of the box.  I will be playing a lot more of this - gotta get some card sleeves!!

Looks like a very good and unusual card game.

Took a lot of time to try to get on top of the rules before our first play, and the first game was a learning experience.

Playing with just a 2-deck starter out of the box, it seems that the runner deck needs to be slimmed down to 45 to 50 cards to make it play better.

Need to try this again before too long.

My first (and currently, only) CCG. I now understand why these games are so insidious. You play, enjoy it, and then think: "If only I had a few more cards I could be that much better".

The game allows intelligent use of bluffing and "feinting" to give a chance to an underdog to outsmart an otherwise better equipped opponent. A CCG that demands planning beyond deck construction.

When I first saw this game, I was unimpressed.  I hated the (mostly) computer-generated art, and wasn't 'into' the theme.  Curiosity led me to give Netrunner a second look, and I quickly became certain that I had found the best CCG of all time.

Unlike any other card game. Whether it's a CCG or a fixed card game like Blue Moon, it blows all other 2 player games away.
Its unique style of play and the fact that each opponent has to use completely different tactics to win make this the absolute finest 2 player game ever designed.
This is a great game with just 2 starter decks and no deck building.  I carry a couple of starters with me anytime I go gaming.

RATING: 8
My favorite CCG.  This one has bluffing, tension galore (yeah, try NOT to sweat when your HQ is full of agenda cards!!!), and atmosphere in gobs. The only problems is finding opponents. The game gets points knocked off because it suffers from the same problems of all CCGs-- namely complicated rules, huge setup time (deck construction), and balance/fairness (rich players have better cards),

Pretty good ccg.  In the games I played, the runner always won.  Maybe more cards would have fixed it, but the asymmetry was not well balanced in a small card pool!

RATING: 10
In my opinion, the best TCG ever made. Each side plays very differently and with a single starter (contains a corp and runner deck) and booster (mix of both), you can plan over and over and over, and every game is still a blast. Tedious deck building is purely optional for the people that like that sort of thing. Yes!

Back in the day, there was a huge blitz of CCGs that flashed into existence then died a horrible death. It's too bad they took Netrunner with them, because this was a tense and exciting asymmetric duel between hacker and corporation that deserved a much longer life than it had. Maybe some day someone will bring it back in a non-collectible format, and that day I'll snap it right up.

The best CCG mechanically, but lacks the incredible diversity of M:tG. Asymmetrical and plays beautifully right out of the starter. 

As an SF geek and a one time player of Cyberpunk 2020 (upon which Netrunner is based), the theme really appeals to me. It's got some great M:tG in-jokes as well (a Serra Angel on a computer screen, card revealing software endorsed by 'Urza Bloodrunner' etc).

I'm looking for cards, for playing rather than collecting. Anyone want to trade me some starters / boosters / Proteus / sack of commons etc?

My comparison is to Magic, the only other CCG I've played so far.

Netrunner is a bit more dependent on luck, owing to the nature of the blind picking done by the runner. Also, suffers from not having any instant spells; once everything on the table is open, it's all open.

Despite that, the game play, if not ruined by luck, is excellent. A lot of fun, a lot of depth, a lot of theme.

RATING: 7.5
Better than average CCG with a good implementation of a cyberpunk theme.  Players have different, unbalanced roles and goals that somehow work really well.  I never got to play this often enough but enjoyed building the decks for both sides.

This could work as the hacking element of a Cyberpunk RPG -- whenever a character tries to hack into something, hand them a prepared deck representing their character and give them a goal, then play a pre-made corporation deck to give them ICE to overcome and databanks to hunt through.

RATING: 7
Color me impressed. I've been turned off some to MTG since being exposed to so many Euros. When I went back to Magic, I found it kind of clunky and slow but still charming. Netrunner, on the other hand, is one slick game. It's isn't clunky at all - although it definitely plays too slow for me. In Netrunner, one player is the Runner, a hacker, and the other player is the Corporation. Both of these entities have their own decks, which contain Corporation-specific or Runner-specific cards. The tableau for each player is laid out uniquely as well. Playing the Corporation means that you try to establish data forts and use ICE program cards to protect your data resources while you build them up to the point of scoring them. As the Runner, your goal is to use icebreaker software to get into those Corporate data forts and "liberate" the data, hence scoring it.

Netrunner boasts a really nice blend of tactics and strategy. You can tell that Garfield learned a lot by designing Magic, and Netrunner is the beneficiary of this deepened understanding. I don't like the theme, Cyberpunk, as much as the theme of Magic - but I have to respect what Netrunner does and how well it does it. It also didn't become as bloated as Magic, perhaps because it didn't catch on as big. One great thing about Netrunner, echoed by many others, is that you can happily play with the basic set (one deck of each side) and a few booster - pretty much forever. The design of the game doesn't lean towards "ubercards" the way many CCGs do.

Overall, I think Netrunner is probably the best CCG I've ever played. I definitely liked it better than Burning Sands, and I also thinks it edges out MTG. Personally, I gripe that it just takes a little too long to play a match, but it probably hits the sweet spot for many.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For two-players the best CCG ever, in terms of gameplay. Offers opportunities for strategies, tactics, and bluffing.

Deck construction is reasonable fun, but can be hampered by the extremely large size of the basic set, and the no-limit deck construction rules. The lack of any faction or colours means that certain cards pretty much appear in any decktype. It also helps if your playgroup is willing to not play the few high powered decktypes, allowing the lesser cards a chance to shine (for example I once had a pretty good Project Vienna deck). This also improves the gameplay - the more unpredictable Netrunner is the better. For that reason some people find sealed play to be the best.

I love "Android Netrunner" which is based on this original game. This TCG was release a year after "Magic The Gathering" and tried to capture the same success but failed miserably. 

The theme was obtuse at best. A game about hackers and corporations has cards like "I Got A Rock." So... they're dropping meteors now? What? 

Has a huge issue with rare and super-rare cards being better than everything else. 

Unlimited copies of each card allowed in a deck is just a terrible, terrible idea that breaks the game.

A hidden gem from Richard Garfield. I eventually got to play this in 2008 for the first time. And now, with nearly 30 games under my belt, I must confess that this game is exceptionnal. The asymetric gameplay and the mechanics are very original. It feels like a real duel in an immersive sci-fi theme (the cyberpunk subgenre, but not only; you can spot some references in the art to movies like Blade Runner)

Bluff, double guessing, tactics, risk taking, luck factor, tension... there are a lot of things packed in one game. You can play many games with one double starter. This is more than a CCG, it's a card game with a thinking boardgame feel. I understand now all the praise and good critics I got or read over the years. The main issue is to get some cards nowadays.

Great game with a very asymmetrical twist to it. Only have a few complaints. 

One is that it was a CCG and the starter decks were also randomized. Wished they had a standardized starter deck that was extremely well balanced. Getting some really good cards in one or the other can make it a little lopsided.

Second complaint is the horrible rule book, but that doesn't really reduce my rating of the game.

My biggest complaint is that the game is all about hidden information and bluffing and trying to figure things out. Unfortuantely, the Runner plays all of his things face up which means the Corporation doesn't really have to work on deducing anything. Maybe it would reduce the amount of asymmetry, but it would have definitely made a more enjoyable game if each side was trying to out guess the other.

Still, as it stands, it is a very good game and I can't wait to try the Android: Netrunner reprint. Just like every out of print game I buy they had to reprint it shortly after... =(

An incredible asymetrical 2-player CCG that did not live nearly long enough.  The strategy is incredible with both sides being COMPLETELY different.  It's easier to win as the Corp, but more satisfying to win as the Runner.

I firmly believe this is the best CCG ever published.

Interesting CCG. Our gaming group used to play this game often, but we eventually gave up because of the imbalance of the game (some might consider this a nice feature, we considered it a drawback.) Theoretically, the corporation and runner decks could be balanced but building a good runner deck required obtaining more rare cards (and thus, spending more money.) On the other hand, building a nice corporation deck (such as tag and fry) does not require much expenditure at all.

My set consists of Runner and Corp decks each containing 200+ cards (mostly individual cards).  

Netrunner (original) is truly one of the best 2 player games ive ever played, the bluffing and tense game play is great. I have no interest in deck building, but with 200 cards in each deck and the fact that you swap sides, replay-ability is immense. 

Have also pimped my version with advancement chips, credit and virus tokens.  I use playmats printed from Bgg.

The new Android Netrunner is good, but i much prefer the original.  The card art/layout is superior and really captures the gritty cyberpunk universe.  I also do not see the need to split the runner and corp into factions.

EDIT: For some reason I prefer this to the Android reboot.  Part of it is the hundreds of hours I spent brain-deep in Cyberpunk, part of it is that I already have a bunch of cards and don't want to shell out for a competitive A:NR collection.

[thing=1301][/thing] seemed, to me, a lot like [thing=124742][/thing]. I know that if playing more, much more, there is likely billions of trillions of chances, from texts to card effects, to use of tags, razz, characters and types of Corps in order to give name and special abilities to the sides, and whatnot. Yet, to me, a casual player, it seems almost like a stretch to give A:N the status of a new and separated game.

The relevant core of everything is here: the way to play the cards - the Corps hidding their actions and walls, protecting their areas (R&D, HQ, serves, etc), paying when they are revealed, trying to block, trap or simply give meat of net damage to the Runner, advancing agendas, and so on. With the Runner scrapping for money, activating keys and ice breakers, doing runs in order to razze cards or access agendas. The 3 clicks for Corp actions and the 4 clicks for Runners - with the possibilities being drawing cards, getting credit (money), using cards or actions in cards. I really thought there would be bigger chances in the main mechanisms.

I can't attest to balance of cards and sides, just that the asymmetry is still very present here, allowing different play styles even in the same side (but less than in A:N, with the inclusion of characters and special abilities).

Overall, [thing=1301][/thing] is not only the root of A:N, is the root, trunk and branches, with A:N mainly being a different bark and having more leaves (I'm commited with the tree analogy). Sure, they are, now, in highly different levels of options, complexity and deck customization. Still, for the casual player, [thing=1301][/thing] will scratch the same itch.

RATING: 10
Wonderful asymetrical and thematic gameplay. You feel like a runner raiding more or less silently the big corporations while fearing for your life, online and offline. Implants, programms, assets, secrets, traps, cyberpunk at its best.

The best part: You feel like your role.

RATING: 5
My plays have been sort of odd so far. As the Runner, you're making wild guesses and hoping they pay off, and you have almost no way to afford doing anything certain. As the Corp, you're hoping the Runner doesn't get any of the good stuff, having a somewhat easier (but not TOO much easier) source of income and just waiting until you fulfill the goals. Don't know what to think yet, I need to play more.

A very good card game hiding in CCG, now LCG, format.

Like most CCGs, this originally suffered from not having a play format that worked for me, though Netrunner starter deck plus two boosters, trim your deck, and then just play is actually quite good...

Still, there remains the lurking suspicion that, in this format, you are missing vital parts of the game and that some redesigned, non-CCG format would be preferable.

I have now played the "living game" Android: Netrunner re-issue and it is quite good.  Hence the revised rating.  Still not sure I want to climb onto the LCG treadmill, but I recognize that it is a lot better than the CCG nightmare.

I found a goodly-sized box of this: perhaps 500 cards? It's a great game, but my dedicated opponent has moved across the country. Arg. Thus, it is up for trade. Update--I found another 500 cards, mostly common, but perhaps 1/3rd Proteus.

RATING: 7
There are some minor mechanical and aesthetic differences between the original NR and FFG's recent reboot, and I can understand why a few serious fans argue that the original remains superior. But for practical purposes the original game is now obsolete. The new version is easily obtained, widely played, and 99% the same as the original. Unless you somehow find yourself surrounded by old school NR players with suitcases full of original cards, there's no reason to go through the trouble of hunting this version down.

RATING: 7
Participated in a draft of ONR packs. Crazy broken things in here. I am happen to have experienced the original game (although we couldn't get the trace rules down). However, the Android version by FFG is distinctly better in every way (art, layout, variety, balance).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In terms of actual game play, this is the best CCG of all time.

(This is "for trade" because I have a number of still-sealed starter decks that I'd be willing to part with.  I'll probably keep my one opened one and one sealed one - to pop open some day with my son.)

Cool.  Great theme.  I expected a lot of dated, corny cyberpunk tropes.  The tropes were there, but they were tastefully done, and well-complemented by some wonderfully dark card art.  Instead of laughing at the theme like I was prepared to do, I found myself really immersed in it, almost against my will.  As for the game, it holds up just as well.  The asymmetric sides are really cool, and I can see the appeal in both deck-building AND in gameplay, something which is rare in a CCG.  Lots of rich decisions in gameplay.  Too bad this one isn't being produced anymore, because this is a beaut.

Easily the best CCG i have played and the only one i would consider playing again. Great theme, nice card artwork, tight and tense gameplay.

*Update* Finally aquired a new sealed starter deck. Showed someone new to the game how it works and then ended playing this all night! Still a cracking game (*ahem*)

*2nd Update* Thank god this game is out of print, otherwise my bank balance would have taken a hit! 

*3rd Update* I wish this game was still in print, then i wouldn't have to pay antique prices trying to complete my collection. Anyone seen a 'Skalderviken SA Beta Test Site' card lying around anywhere!?

An excellent CCG featuring deep, strategic play and asymmetrical sides. The artwork is very dated, but the gameplay is both outstanding and timeless. It's expensive and hard to find now...It needs to be reprinted and given the LCG box set treatment.

Interesting game. One of the best asymmetrical ones I've played, maybe even the best. It feels a little bit long for what it is, especially if one player builds up a huge lead, and I don't really care for the flavor (I like the theme, just not the art/specific flavor text), but it's still a fun game. The reprint might be more my style, but I'm not sure I want to get into another game that requires a time investment outside of actually playing it.

Brilliant game, marred only by the collectibility aspect (use proxies). Totally different feel for each side, and I firmly believe, based on 200  plays, that it's very nicely balanced.  I have to place this as my all-time favorite 2-player game.  So much tension, so many difficult decisions, so many options to analyze.... One NR starter is better and more replayable than 99% of 2-player games out there, including the vaunted Kosmos series.

But I have to admit, making this a "deal and play" game was and still is a PITA. And Android:NR does not change or improve that.

I only give this a 9 out of 10 because I hate the collectible aspect. Otherwise the design is perfect. Great program-like gameplay-flow makes for very little confusion. The simulation of hacker vs corporate security is great, fun, and full of black humour. Essential game for any cyberpunk fan. Asymetrical sides makes it interesting to switch sides.

Yeah, this is that good.  What killed it was 1) the playability out of the starter, and 2) who, back then, was going to pay $18 for a starter set?  Even though it's a bargain, 'cause you don't really need anything else besides maybe a booster or two.  Great game.

RATING: 8
Make no mistake. This is a BETTER game than MTG.It, unfortunately, was one more of the probably hundreds of CCGs released after Magic. The game simply never gathered the critical mass in player base to make it successful. Wizards' support for the game in the form of tournaments and expansions understandably wwaned. The game died. Sadly, there simply weren't enough sets released to fill out the game. CCGs rely on novel deck designs and the amount of viable strategies available to be fun and replayable. Netrunner doesn't have this and is the reason I don't rate it a 10.

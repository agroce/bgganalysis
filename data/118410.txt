A filler has to be easy, fast, fun and light: Drecksau is all of this and even more, since it’s full of interaction and hampering among the players as well.

Its theme only isn’t too brilliant but it’s undoubtedly functional to the mechanics and cleverly developed: it’s not a suprise Drecksau did quickly become my gaming group’s most played filler.

Fun travel card game, theme-wise also OK for playing with kids.

RATING: 4
A super simple filler-style card game where you try to make your pigs muddy while preventing other players from doing the same.

Lots of take-that action as you try to keep other players' pigs clean, but nothing special. It seems like the winner just ends up being the person who happened to get his pigs muddy at a point where other players didn't have the right cards to stop him.

Probably a good game to pull out with non-gamers for a quick, easy game, but I don't see much other use for it and there are other games I like better for that purpose.

RATING: 6
As a game to play with young children (4-12) I can't recommend this highly enough and it is worth an 8 out of 10 at least. My 10 year old daughter asks to play it continually, and that is a rarity amongst games.  There is just enough of interest to keep the adults happy, more than enough chance to mean the children often win, and a delightful theme that holds the whole thing together beautifully.  What's more: it is over in 5 minutes and so no one gets bored.  In fact there always seems time for 'just one more'.

Oh my. Is this even a game? It might be tolerable if it consistently stayed in the 1 to 3 minutes range, but I've seen it take much longer (but fortunately haven't had the misfortune to be in such a game myself). There are much better games even for that sort of time slot, though.

RATING: 7
Juego de cartas corto y rápido ideal para jugar con crios pequeños 5+ años. La puntuación es lo que refleja, si tuviera que jugarlo con adultos sería un 5 y no lo jugaría.

Con Niños está bien, les hace buscar pequeñas decisiones y el juego tiene un tema divertido que les agrada. Como alternativa al Uno está genial.

RATING: 6.5
Harmless, fun filler. Not too balanced; our first game ended after three rounds as no rain or washing cards came up. Won't play this forever, but we had plenty of laughs. My daughter (5) loves this. Even our 2.5 year old loves to shout "Ich schrubb Dich!" (although she doesn't understand all the cards yet and loses concentration quickly).

Well playable with two as well, but you have to use more pigs. We use six pigs and sometimes four hand cards and it works just fine.

Edit, two years later: I was quite wrong here, the staying power of this game is amazing. It's one of those games that when playing with younger kids, is actually fun for adults, too. So it still sees playtime here and there.

I bought this game to play with my kids so let's call this what it is... A game of little skill... mostly luck... And offers no really strategy (a little is a strtch).
But any game that I can play with my four year old son and and sixty four year old dad (3 generations), and my son wins twice in a row putting the biggest smile I have ever seen on his face is a winner for me!!
My kids are constantly asking for this to return to the table ... that says it all!!

I bought this game, because it seemed really accessible for everyone. The theme is really cute and silly, so people really enjoyed it when playing it for the first time yesterday. For me personally the game is way too light and lacks any real depth. But since it is so quick to play and easy to grasp, this makes a good game to play with our grandparents, who can't handle the more complicated stuff.

[b]If you are a serious gamer, move on, nothing to see here. Cute little filler.

Great game for kids. The box says 7+ but my daughter is only just 4 and it's her favourite game. She understands all of the card options, can hold the three cards in her hand, loves to attack other players, loves the theme and is beginning to play strategically - building up her barn collection before hitting others with rain. She will play 5 or 6 games in a row without becoming bored.

2-4 players. Fun for the five year old, but a round can take a long time. Lots of "two steps forward, one step back" action. Also wish the cards had been designed more creatively -- maybe the dirty/clean pig cards could have had different poses, rather than all 12 of them looking exactly the same.

One of my kids favourite games (they would for sure rate it an 8 or a 9). At the same time is enjoyable for adults to play. I have used this one to introduce the kids to "losing stuff" and to teach them to go for glory instead of revenge.

tl;dr: ultra light time killer

This game is almost pure luck. You have very few cards to play with and sometimes you just can't do anything. So this is more of a time killer than a real game as what you do is almost entirely dictated by the cards.

A super simple game with great art that I teach to the littlies, but also kids of all ages!

This is a smash hit with my brother and sister-in-law, and I know they're thinking of the younguns too but they still love playing it. It's a whole lot of luck and a bit of risk taking/mitigation but it's just so much fun to play. It's really healthy to be able to mess around with a game like this as well as all the dense and complex games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Award winning game in which you have 3-5 pigs that flip from being clean to dirty, idea being to get all dirty to win.

5 or so different cards add a barn, lock and lightning conductor to protect from farmer, lightning and rain storm that can be played as 'attack' cards to ensure your pigs don't all get dirty first.

I'd recommend this for bright 4-5 yr olds. My 6 year old picked it up fast and enjoys but it is very simple once learned and to-ing and fro-ing of dirty and clean pigs is tiresome in 2p. Because of this we plan to limit 2p game to one runthrough of pack of cards as opposed to proper win condition which is one player has all clean pigs - which might take forever.

Update: can't help think better with large group as chaos of flipping everyone's bacon has more strategy potential. Also uses that dang awful computer tablet art that can ruin a game before it's out of shrink for my moany old self.

A neat tile-laying set-collection game with nice pieces. The tile powers make sense within the theme. "Starfish" destroys. "Coral" protects. "Trash" reduces the beauty of the sea-bed. It's short, simple, strategic, and it has a lot going for it.

Pleasant tile game.  I like the market mechanism and the game length.  I found myself squinting at some of the art, as it's not very functional.  A fairly non-stressful game with good potential.

I found the game to be lacking, to be frank. The bits are really nice, the art is gorgeous, but gameplay is not very exciting. Mainly, the luck of the draw for the market determined the winner in all our games. But I think what disappointed me the most was the lack of interaction between players. I'll definitely give the game another chance, though, because I would very much like to enjoy it.

All with a non-violent theme.

A very simple game of drafting tiles in order to score points.  There is a 3x3 grid of available tiles, and on your turn you may purchase an orthogonal row of them to add to your board.  Most of the tiles score you points at the end of the game in various ways, and some of the tiles earn you additional income on your turn.

After you purchase some tiles or opt not to, you collect income based on the contents of your board, which you can use to buy tiles on your next turn.

Play continues until someone fills their board completely, at which point everyone gets one last turn.  Then, everyone checks their score to determine the winner.

Overall, Octopus' Garden is just a very simple drafting game made slightly interesting by various tile interactions that can occur.  For example, starfish are worth a good amount of points, but attempt to eat the pearls on your board, which are your income.  However, in the end, the design just felt kind of "old" to me with not a lot of interesting stuff going on.  A harmless game that's neither bad or particularly great.

Juego en el que ganará el que componga el fondo marino más bonito. El juego se basa en comprar losetas en pack (filas o columnas del mercado) y colocarlas en un tablero personal del modo mas eficiente para la puntuación final. No tiene profundidad ni complejidad pero es un bonito juego y se juega bastante rápido.
Para evitar el hecho de que todos pasen de comprar y vayan cogiendo perlas para mejorar su economía recomiendo una variante leída en bgg:
Cuando nadie compre en una ronda, se mezclarán todas las losetas del mercado y se volverán a colocar aleatoriamente (esto permitirá que se formen nuevas filas y columnas)
Si aún así nadie compra durante una nueva ronda se hará lo mismo pero esta vez quitando al azar 3 losetas que se eliminarán del juego y se sustituirán por otras 3 losetas de la bolsa.
Tras esto los jugadores están obligados a comprar (no pueden pasar, a no ser que no tengan suficientes perlas para comprar ninguna fila o columna)

A perfect thematic filler after a round of Reef Encounter. I like having gaming sessions based on some recurring theme and this mellows out the brain waves after a hard brain burning session of "Reef Encounter"
 I applaud my fellow canadian designer for making an easy yet engaging game with just the right amount of celeberal tension. Who knew star fishes could be this exciting?

Really nice little light filler game however 3/4 of the players instantly complained that there is no octopus in this game. 

Starfish moving straight away when added you your garden is an interesting mechanic as it can make it difficult to fill your garden but they are 5 points each so can you afford to miss out?

After three plays, I like Octopus' Garden and rate it a 7. I think that the market is a neat mechanism, and figuring out how to lay out the garden for best effect is fun for me. My husband rates the game a 5. In general, games that require spacial arrangement are difficult for him to play well, diminishing his enjoyment. The components are a nice quality, and the artwork makes a very pretty game on the table.

With 2 players, putting all of the provided tiles in the draw bag means that many tiles will not ever be drawn. The tiles that we did draw were often the same ones that we already drew. We did not see the distribution of tiles that would have let us try the full range of strategies available in the game. So we tried reducing the number of each type of tile (so that we played with one more than half of the full number of each time), and thought that the game was more fun for 2 players that way. However, it was a lot of work to do the selective reduction.

We played with the Parrotfish expansion and like it. 

I am not sure that this game will stay in our collection. As much as I like it, the man is not likely to want to play it. I might explore a solo option before I move it out.

Octopus' Garden is a nice light-to-middle weight set collection game, with a well-executed theme and some nice economic twists to make it fairly special.

The economic motor is driven on a pearl economy fed by oysters- which are unattractive so there is a small penalty involved with keeping them.  There are also Starfish which are very attractive, but which eat any oysters they can reach. Corals prevent Starfish from moving, but are otherwise low in value. There are also some point counters which give a 5pt bonus for collecting sets: anemones and seagrass.  There are also treasures which increase in value as the number in the set increase.

All of this adds up to a nicely tuned game: it is easy enough for a child to play, but tricky enough and thematic enough to appeal to any eurogamer.  Starting this at a 7.25 after (2) solo plays (3/4 player).

This is a fun game. Right price, easy to learn, good components, great theme.

Things I liked including buying an entire row or column. This was fun and it changed quite often.

Some placement choices for your garden are also interesting. 

Money feels incredibly tight in the game. Well, pearls, but they act as money. Because it was so tight, the choice of buy or pass seemed more often to not be a choice but required due to limited choices.

The anemone vs. feather plant are hard to differentiate graphically.

The starfish movement is a tinge fiddly when you're tracking. 

I'm not sure more plays would reveal new layers to the strategy. The game is fairly light. However, I think it's worth a look. It's a good casual game and I think younger players would LOVE it. We all liked it, we just wanted our choices to matter a tinge more. 

Solid game.

Cute multiplayer solitaire game that makes thematic sense. (ie: starfish try to eat oysters; if you make a large enough section of seaweed you attract a sea horse, etc)

Only played base game with 2. The expansion tiles add interesting additional options; hopefully will try soon.

Kids set collection game where you have some clams that give you pearls with which you purchase items. You then build your garden (collection) and score points based on the combo that you have acquired.

A simple tile laying game: the players take the role of octopodes (octopi or octopusses, as you prefer) constructing decorative gardens on the sea floor. The market is the most interesting aspect: nine tiles are laid out in a 3x3 grid, and a player must take all three tiles in a single row or column, for good or ill. It hurts to be short of cash and forced to take cheap tiles! Oyster tiles produce pearls, which are used as currency to purchase tiles, but oysters are not worth many points at the end of the game. Starfish are worth many points, but eat oysters - don't get them too early.

Octopus' Garden is pretty to look at and simple to teach - it would be a good choice for new players interested in a light game. But there isn't much meat to it, and the outcome seems decided by luck at the start of the game: get an early oyster or two and you should win. There is little the other players can do to influence this.

RATING: 7.5
A beautiful game of creating your very own undersea garden! Each player has their own player board (garden) and will fill it with sea grass, anemone, star fish, artifacts, oysters and even human trash. Each player uses their pearls to purchase items each turn. Items are available for purchase on the shopping board (which is a 3X3 grid); you must purchase a complete row of 3 items. 

The expansion parrot fish and diver are excellent additions to the base game.

The rulebook is a bit lacking.  For example, it forgets to ever tell you that the numbers on the tiles are the score, and contains contradictory statements about how starfish behave in corner cases.  Those things can be figured out, but it's annoying that a simple games doesn't have completely clear & precise rules.

There is also a real risk of the game stalling, and the rulebook provides no provision for all players passing in sequence.  That may not happen, but if it does, the printed rules simply let the game go on forever.

The sea anemone and feather worm look nearly identical and are very easy to confuse -- a costly mistake.  I know they are similar in real life, but that is no excuse for poor information representation in a game.

Most importantly, the game is boring.  What you can do is determined by luck + board position that cannot be predicted.  The starfish are the most promising part of the game, representing both risk and potential.  In my first game, we saw NONE of them.  In my second, they came out, and turned out to be boring and a bit computational.

My kids enjoyed playing with the pieces, but not the game.  I enjoyed the idea of how starfish worked, but not the game.  Oh well.

The game is about purchasing tiles for an underwater garden.  A very fast game, which makes it a decent filler, but it does have a heavy luck factor.

Edit: The luck factor is especially glaring in the set up of the board at the start.  If there are two oysters in one line on the start board, the first player to buy them will likely win the game (unless many more oysters come out right away).  I recommend a variant where if more than one oyster shows up on the starting board, put them back and redraw.

Where is the Octopus in this game? There needs to be a game marker for each person with an octopus on it. My daughter wanted to play with the octopus. Other than that, we play with the non-garbage variant because she didn't want to buy any garbage tiles. I'm fine with that, as she's only 4 and loves the game. The graphics are amazing.

Lite, thinky, family friendly, low interaction, with a time on target mechanism for destroying your oysters, which act as resource generators.

Attractive, fun tactical game. There is a hint of strategy in balancing an early need for pearls with a late game need for points and when to force the end of the game.

Even though the box is not small, this rates highly as a coffeehouse game. It can be played 2P with the two gardens and the market in the middle on a small table.

My wife liked it, although it takes a game or two to remember/understand the special abilities of the tokens.

Just brilliant, really. Super-simple rules provide emergent tradeoffs and complexity of choices, and gambling on what you may be able to get. Passing at the right moment to let your wealth accumulate can get you well ahead of the competition, but it can be a risky tactic. This is so addictive that we played it 5 times in a row the first time we tried it!

The game is very thematic,  educational and has got some interesting ideas.  However I felt the gameplay was not very exciting.  There is almost no interaction between players and luck of the draw can ruin the game. Unlike other reviewers,  I am not that impressed by the artwork ; anemones and feather plants are hard to differentiate graphically.  I may give this game another chance as I would like so much to enjoy it.

Nice straight forward family game. Needs one or two extra dimensions like the Diver expansion to make it a better game. But then I dont think the diver expansion is available.

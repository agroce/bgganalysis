Automobiles is a nice take on racing cars. Or actually this game is a deck builder disguised as a car race in which cards are replaced with cubes. First you analyse the track, try to find the ideal deck composition for it, execute your plan and see how well you do. The aim is to progress a prefixed number of steps on the track with the least amount of turns. There is a fair amount of luck in having the right actions at your disposal when you need them most. However, the race is rather long so the best deck should win most of the time. Interaction between the players is limited to blocking vital spaces on the track (only one car may occupy a space at a time).
 
Replacing cards with cubes and a draw bag is a double edged sword. On one side it eliminates the need of shuffling your deck and ensures a perfect shuffle. On the other side it requires the players to memorise the function of each cube. Moreover cubes are harder to handle and are more likely to be lost or accidentally scattered across the premises.
 
I had fun with building my own deck of actions, and interestingly it seems that competitive strategies are many. First three quarters of the game are the ones when you can still affect the outcome. The last part is basically just sitting back and seeing your deck do the work for you. I am not sure about the longevity of Automobiles as the track fixes the possible strategies and it seems that there is not so much need (or even possibility) to adapt to the situation or change your plans during the game.

RATING: 5
It occurred to me after playing Automobiles that deck building/bag building is one of the most abstract game mechanisms. Each card or cube does have a particular meaning, but why, in thematic terms do you have only a limited and random selection of them each turn?  Why can't I choose the action most appropriate to the situation?  While in Dominion the medieval kingdom building is the thinnest of thematic veneers, Automobiles provides two tracks and cars to race on them.  It sets up expectations of a race game and then it does things like let you improve your car (by purchasing cubes) throughout the course of the race.  It presents you with a fourth gear corner and then leaves you with only third gear cubes.   As a game about racing cars it is incoherent.  If you can set that aside and view Automobiles as an exercise as abstract as Dominion in optimising your deck/bag, then there is some interest here. 

Production quality is to AEG's normal good standards.  The artwork is functional but forgettable.

I like the concepts in this. Turning deck building into a literal race is such a good concept because that's what Dominion actually is - so fine tuning your engine makes so much thematic sense. Good game, want to try more than just the starter cards.

RATING: 6
A bag builder wherein you draw and select cubes that then power you around a track such that, presumably, you are building your bag strategically to optimize your speed and trajectory around a track.  Of course, your best laid plans can then be foiled by a bad draw on key turns, as well as other players, essentially without any ability to predict such an event, placing their cars in front of yours.  

Thus, this seeming hybrid between a race game (think Trouble or Parcheesi) and a euro, can at times feel quite euro when, for example, shopping for cubes or using the colored cubes for one time effects, and other times, like you just pushed the pop-o-matic in Trouble, and the roll came up wrong.  The former is fun; the latter not so much any more.

On the plus side, thematically, it feels fun racing the car around the track, and  shopping for good cubes then drawing them feels fun.

A great bag builder with nice versatility in which of the card sets you use to define the abilities of the cubes. Intuitive, clever movement rules, and it all has a pretty clean look about it in line with the series. Trains is probably still my fave of the three, because of all the expansion content and Rising Sun, but this definitely gives it a track run for its money.

A rather interesting bag building game, but one that tends to be too random, for such a long game (it's not very long, but much longer than it needs to be). Also, the downtime between turns is way too much. I'd play again if in the right mood, but it's not a game I'd recommend.

Rating based on a single play. A deck builder using cubes, each color corresponding to a different card (to avoid printing a ton of cards) and having an on-board play. Different length races would probably play out differently as well. 

This may not work, but I'm intrigued so far.

I found this game by chance, and I'm so glad that I did since it's a fantastic one. Racing isn't a theme I'd normally go for, so it was really  likely that I'd just ignore the game when I saw it, but luckily there was something to it that caught my attention.

The game's very simple in terms of rules but it offers a huge amount of decisions in the process and the fact that you get a different set of ability cards every single game, makes it incredible in terms of replayability. 

Technically, it's just another deckbuilder, but the ability to see the cars representing your and your opponents' progress on the track really makes a difference.  I'm yet to play a better game in this category (i.e. deckbuilder).

RATING: 8
1st play. Very simple clear rule book with excellent examples. Teaching the game is a breeze and you start paying very quickly. After that the game licks along at a pace. Yes you need to remind people about taking wear and the importance of sliding the cubes to the right sections as they are used at the right time but apart from that this is a self policing experience. After three laps the game was very close and everyone enjoyed it.

Game play is slick and I look forward to trying out new combinations of cards. A keeper.

RATING: 7
A bag-building game but it plays and feels much like a deck-builder. I like how your focus is trying to get your car around the track rather than the more typical "get points" thing that most deckbuilders do. The components are really nice in this one too. The combination of cards can lead to very different games. In my first play, Wear cubes were practically a non-factor whereas they were a huge factor in the second game because there wasn't an efficient way to get rid of them. Also player count makes a big difference as downtime is an issue at 4 and especially 5 players especially if you have AP players. I'd happily play this some more but probably not with 5.

Cube-building that is based on the idea of deck-building. I played Trains and didn't love it; I didn't play Planes, but heard not-so-good things. Automobiles was a pleasant surprise. There is nothing terribly special with this game, but the racing theme actually works quite well and I enjoyed how the drafting mechanic works. I will play this more yet it isn't really good enough to justify a purchase because I can't really see the people who I'd play it with getting too excited about it.

Neat "deckbuilder" with a brilliant conceit: have cubes represent your cards instead of cards. The result is an infinitely-variable set-up using exactly the same components, but just changing out 5 or so cards every game. I wish more games would use this mechanic.

The game itself is a decent race game, though it's not unlikely to see a runaway leader. One lousy turn (or an opponent's awesome turn) can leave a player behind and out of the race relatively early on. Very fun, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm continuing to enjoy this, and picked up a copy myself, but it feels a little unstable - like the cube abilities were not really balanced, just picked for a range of powers that modify all the things in the game. Hybrid Engine, for example, can lead to pretty random and un-fun games in many circumstances. The flipside track is also less interesting than it looks. Also, the game can be pretty random, so keep it moving. Depending on which Yellow power you get, the first bag cycle can potentially be extremely swingy.

Anyway, all this is stuff that makes me nervous about the balance in the long run, but mechanically there is a lot to like here and it plays quickly with a bunch of fun choices. While I have some reservations, no question for me the positives substantially outweigh the negatives. We'll see where it is after 10 plays.

Enjoyed this one - much more of a cousin to Trains than the kinda random Planes. Godawful rulebook though, given this is actually a simple game. Who the hell writes these things? Standards in the industry seem to have declined from bad to abysmal.

I know it's way too early in the year to say this, but I cannot reiterate this enough, but this is set to become my GAME OF THE YEAR.  This has so much going for it.  A bag building mechanic, variable set up with 2 different tracks and a simple way to change up what cards you play with (and obvious room in the box for more cards... and they'll definitely come out with more tracks).  Simple gameplay.  But so much racing around a track goodness!!!  I want so much more of this game, and I am excited to try out the different card combinations and then seeing how random setups work too.

LOVE IT. Unique deck builder with lots of clever little refinements: accelerated early game thanks to the pre-made purchase round, fun player interaction (love that hands are open - leads to much scheming and table talk), multi-use cards, and excellent expansion potential (cards + cubes + maps).

However... the card balance in this game is just way off. A lot of those green cards, in particular, feel overpowered. Mathematically-minded players might be able to self-balance this (though likely with resorting to banning certain cards), but it's a real shame. I hope future expansions can sort this out.

A bag building game this time with a racing theme and I thought it worked pretty well. Cubes either move you on the track, give you a special action, or allow you to buy other cubes. The movement can be tricky because you can pin yourself on the board if you don't stay near the middle and it can cost you dearly. Although with 5 I think it outstayed it's welcome given the time it takes to manipulate at least 7 cubes in the most efficient way possible each turn. I also wish the cards were available per player instead of only one copy as we kept having to reach to reference the cards. Otherwise this is a fine game and while I'd rather pull out PItchCar as a racing game this is a good alternative.

I haven't been able to play as often as I would like to, but this game seems to have a lot of promise. I love the "bag builder" variation of card building games.

Automobiles is a deck‑building game in which the fun is cubed — because instead of using cards to build a deck, you build with your collection of cubes. These cubes not only allow you to race your car around the track, but they also allow you to improve your handling, optimize your pit crew, and boost your speed, all of which are your keys to victory!

Enjoyed a taster of this game - bit overwhelmed (as usual) when it was first explained, but once we got going (fortunately I didn't have to go first!) it soon became very clear how it worked. Only had time for one lap. Next time, I might at least have some clue what's worth spending initial money on. (I got lucky this time - got a gearbox since I was starting in last place, so that got me a good first move.)

Since I don't own Automobiles, all my plays of it have been over on [url=http://www.yucata.de]Yucata[/url]. Because of this, I can't really comment on the components or downtime between turns. Another thing is that I haven't seen all the blue cards in action, so I can't really tell if some of some them are kind of overpowered or make for a boring game, a common complaint I've seen in the forums. But what I can say is that I do enjoy the core of Automobiles quite a bit. The management of the cubes in your bag and on your player sheet, the positioning of your car on the track and the puzzle of what to do with the cubes you've drawn is enjoyable.

Although the theme isn't easy to sell with my gaming group, I would consider buying a copy for the right price.

Players are racing cars around an oval race track, or an alternate universe Monza track.  Nice bag builder where cubes are proxies for cards, representing your car's gearbox, tyres, pit crew, etc.  Cubes are either actioned for their ability, or used as cash to buy more cubes, allowing your car to be tuned.  Once you are up and running, the game plays very smoothly, and is one of the better deck builders out there.  Thoroughly enjoyable.

There are not enough race games published these days, they are few and far between.  So it was with some excitement I played [thing=180680][/thing]. 

It starts off really well as you build your bag-engine and watch the race develop.  The downside is that by the time you get toward the end of the game, a few laps later, each person is pulling many cubes from the bag and the combos which entail mean that turns last a long time, with players moving a long way around the track in a fiddly sequence of movements.  Maybe we should have played a couple of laps fewer, that may solve this issue.  Whatever, it left me not wanting to play it again.

awful game, I already hate deck building but this is worse than the worst deck builder. First the game let's you choose between a nascar race or a f1 race. Difference? 2 corners on the board that do not influence the game. Second, you do the decbuilding with cubes in a bag. Worst thing is with every action you do, you get brown cubes as a "reward". These cubes are constantly blocking your actions. If I want to get the real race feeling, i will grab Formula D or Top Race, but I will never touch this game again! worst game ever!

At first I liked this game because I thought the bag building and racing marriage was a great and elegant choice, but as I've played it more I find that at least half the games have a dominant strategy (that is not fun or thematic to run) or have way too much that can't be accounted for to the point that you don't feel like you lost because you were necessarily outplayed.  Better balance in the cubes would allieviate this and cause my rating of it to go higher, but having played expansion stuff, it doesn't help any and even exasperates this issue in some instances.

After one play, very excited about this game.

Is like Trains in the way it combines deck-building with a board, and you have to manage waste/wear, but also like Star Realms in that you can occasionally get massive combos that are really exciting to play.

Have to play it more to be sure, but I could see liking this more than Trains, which is one of my all-time favourite games.  Compared to Trains, it's similar, or perhaps a bit higher, in how much you interact with other players, what happens on the board feels more important, and you feel a bit more like you're building an "engine" (both figuratively and literally).

Streamlined bag builder that has its own feel.  Each different set of cards have their own synergies and feel differently useful depending on which map you use.  Some cards are more fun than others and some extra variety on top of what is offered seems warranted, but does offer enough variation to not get stale.  Box too big but I appreciate the cube trays and insert. Theme is nicely done and makes board play intuitive.  As good as "Trains", and the board plays differently enough that it doesn't fall prey to the jones theory for us.

This is a fast-paced, easy to setup, highly interactive deckbuilder. I've played it with 2, 3, and 4 players and definitely feel that 4 player is where it really shines.

We also played mostly 3 or 4 lap games - which felt like the right game length to get our engines going.

"Automobiles" succeeds greatly where "Trains" failed: the game is really all about the board and interacting with other players is key. This and unique mechanic based cards help it to feel more original than just "Dominion with a board."

In addition to the fun of engine building, "Automobiles" has three features that make it really shine: Wear, Movement, and Open Hands.

Wear and Movement both factor into a great risk reward mechanic. Spaces on the racetrack are in four colors: white, light gray, dark gray, and black. Darker spaces allow players to move further in a single action - but they also create more wear on your car (which adds useless cards into your deck). Additionally, you can only move onto a space if you have a cube (card) of the matching color. This means that while moving on a black spot may move you the furthest this turn, it's very possible that it will put you in a position where you'll be unable to move at all next turn! You have to assess on a case by case basis when this risk is worth taking.

Open Hands means that you can see what spaces your opponents will be able to move on their next turn. This is a key mechanic - as you'll want to position yourself smartly to try to block them from moving past you - or at the very least make their moves less efficiently on their turn.

The game definitely has flaws. The card variety just isn't that great right now - with only 5 cards changing each game. Many of the cards cycled through also feel functionally similar to one another. Compared to Dominion, the strategy can feel much more straightforward depending on the cards in the game. Thanks to the strong interactivity and fun engine building mechanics, the game is still a blast to play - and hopefully the problems will be addressed in a future expansion!

RATING: 9
Not a great game for Yucata play, since (in some layouts) the ebb and flow of "I guess I do nothing" turns is part of the challenge. And the finer points of the theme are totally lost on me.

BUT it does things I've never seen another deckbuilder do by making your discard pile-- easily viewable because this uses cubes instead of cards-- a key resource and part of your pacing. This is one of those games I already want an expansion for because I think there's a LOT more the system could do. (New maps might be interesting but are not what I mean.)

I can't believe how much I like this game.

Love the differences between plays based on cards and tracks.

Great take on a 'deck builder'.  Plus, with a board you feel like you are doing something other than just building a deck.

Vrum, vrum, vruumvrumvrum…
A közlekedési járműveket bemutató sorozat tagjai közül (Trains, Plains, …) eddig ezt sikerül kipróbálnom. A játék témája nevéből ered, versenyautóinkkal különböző pályákon és különböző körszámban versenyezhetünk egymással. Aki elsőnek ér célba, nyer és akkor a többiek versenybeli helyezését is értékeljük.
Hangzatosan a „deck-building”, kártyaépítés helyett itt „bag-building”, azaz „zacsiépítés” vagy kulturáltabban fogalmazva húzózsák-építés folyik.
Lapok helyett kockákat húzol zsákocskádból, majd eldöntöd, hogy az adott színhez tartozó akciót használod fel és robogsz előre, vagy további kockákat vásárolsz, vagy kombinálod a kettőt.
Természetesen a játék elején te döntöd el, hogy a rendelkezésre álló szponzori keretből, összeharácsolt léből milyen kockákat veszel meg pluszban a mindenki számára kötelező alap kockakészlet mellé.
Az általános kicsit-közepeset-nagyot haladsz kockák mellett van a többi spéci kocek, amelyeknél az adott szín jelentését a játék elején határozzátok meg a rendelkezésre álló lehetőségek közül (vannak előre ajánlott beállítások is kezdőknek).
Hogy tovább fokozzuk a versenyt, minden mozgásod után egy vagy több elhasználódást jelző kockát is megszerzel, ami a kezedbe húzható hasznos kockák számát csökkenti. Ezeket egyes spéci kockákkal vagy szerviz megállással tudod eltüntetni. Ha valaki mögé be tudsz állni mozgásod végén, akkor nem kapsz ilyet. Plusz, ha egy-egy turbóbb spéci kockát használsz, akkor ahhoz is kapsz ilyet. A full-gáznak ára is van.
Alapvetően tetszett a játék, jópofa a kockák húzogatása és a versengés. Ami nálam az értékelését igen befolyásolta, hogy a spéci kockák hatásai között ég és föld különbség lehet. 1-1 típusú kocka begyűjtésével nagy előnyre szert tudsz tenni, jó lett volna egy kicsit balanszosabb játék.
Magyarul még nem érhető el, de aránylag kevés szöveggel dolgozik a játék.
Akit a fentiek nem riasztanak, bátran próbája ki (akár online is, ha tetszik neki a téma).

It would appear that racing games, in whatever form, tend not to be for me. Most deckbuilders are pretty random when you get down to it, but this one is even worse--if you don't get your abilities at the right time, or if your gears don't come out properly, you can be in for a world of tedium.

A great addition to the series by AEG.

There are many choices that one can make on any move but not too many that a player is overwhelmed. Fantastic game!

A "bag-building" game (as opposed to deck-building.

Buy "cards" (ie: cubes that go into your bag) that let you race your car more efficiently and quickly around the track. Going fast or over certain terrain gives you garbage cubes which you will need to continually clean out of your pool of cubes if you want to keep up with the other racers.

An interesting take on a race game using the deck building concept.

Really like this one so far, my favorite racing game (although I admittedly haven't played many). It's fairly simple but still has a good amount of decisions to make. I'll try to get better components for the cars and possibly player boards, which are functional but not that visually appealing. The look of the game is rather dull when compared to Formula D. That being said the gameplay is much more interesting IMO. Highly recommended to anyone who doesn't dislike pool-building games.

Neutral - on occasion

A deck builder with racing-on-board play uses cubes to represent for cards(instead of printing 500+ cards as Dominion). It only takes a few turns to be familiar with the rules/cards, very approachable. 

Basically, the bag-building in this game is about running the right lane(inside /outside) at right time, not very tough choices. For me, the main fun is that cars constantly block each other.

I suspect, if playing with less than 4-5p, the track will not be crowded enough to be fun. Since most (strategy/family) games are not good at 5p, with 2-3p I have many other good ones to play, so that's pretty minor.

3-5 players? Racing game with bag building. Similar to Trains, but lighter.

Bag builder game that works so well for a racing game. The more you push through the fast lanes, your engine gets more damaged resulting in drawing more junk cubes. Then its all about thinning the bag so that you don't draw those junk cubes as often while keeping on par with the other players. The ruleset is also very simple so its a good introductory game for new players on deckbuilding mechanics.

RATING: 7
This was fine. I dislike deckbuilders where hitting the right combination of cards is important. In particular I find the all or nothing money of something like dominion to be frustrating, as well as the emphasis on comboing effects and thus needing action cards to come out together and in the right order. So the fact that you can almost always use whatever move you get on a turn to at least move some is a good thing in my eyes. But the way wear works can still cause luck of the draw problems. If all of your wear clearing cubes come out early on in your trip through the bag (or worse, are in the last few cubes and force you to reset before you can use them) then you'll very quickly become unable to do anything. It's moderately entertaining (though still fairly unoriginal) otherwise, but luck still plays too big a part for my taste.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2017)

I absolutely abhor racing games. I’m not sure why but they don’t interstate me in the least. I was going to pass Automobiles but then I found out it has a Bag Building mechanism and I love those games so I decided to check it out.

The rules are much easier than I initially though. You can explain them under 6 minutes.

I hate the theme.

In your turn you either make a pit stop or move around the track. Once you have certain cubes using them is obvious, but the strategy lays in how you buy the cubes. Also you need to balance the need to use the cube right now for its effect or for money to buy more cubes. To summarize, Automobiles does have interesting decisions, but they aren’t very complex.

Best with 3 players but it plays very well with 2. I could play up to 4 players but for this point upward I begin to feel the downtime for such a simple game. If the game moves at a quick pace I can enjoy it.

I really like that it comes with 2 different tracks to race and I’m pretty sure expansions will come. Automobiles seems very easy to expand.

Bottom line, Automobiles is an ok game for me. I won’t buy it due to its theme, but I can play it and enjoy it due to its mechanism. It is perhaps the best racing game out there. I was expecting a heavier game, but it is fun for what it offers. Novel game.

I have played Automobiles a great deal of times in a very short time. I hate the theme, but I really enjoy the game so I must upgrade its rating. Automobiles is a good game and now I must have it :D. I love the main mechanism (bag building) and the game is very fun.

I prefer to play it with 2 or 3 players, but I will play with any configuration of players if they play fast.

It has a lot of replayability as there are many different cards for each category. I want to explore the game further.

In most copies I have played, there was one missing bag.

For me, it is the best race game out there and the only one I truly enjoy. I will buy it along with all its expansions.

Online play at Yucata.de - An interesting bag builder that fits perfectly in a line with Trains. My one worry compared to the average deckbuilder is that luck of the draw can result in monster movements on the racing track or plain crap. There are probably less risky strategies to avoid this and a good build of the bag will go a long way. Will play more to see where this settles.

I just don't see the appeal of bag building. Is it really that much better to randomize in a bag rather than by shuffling cards?

I honestly didn't expect this game to have so much replay-ability.  It is a deck building/cube building game. Build your supply of cubes for various routes on the racetrack and supplementing the normal movements with movement and cube modifiers. The game adds in random card abilities for each game, kind of like the "Randomizer" cards that AEG's Trains has.  Game takes about 20-30 min to teach or do first couple demo rounds. This game hits a good casual yet strategic itch, you can play this game mindlessly or really dig into it if you'd like.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This feels like a solid bag builder where a number of the cubes can be different from game to game depending on the card used for the color. Much like Dominion, I expect big money strategies (er, speed) to dominate early plays until effective combos are worked out or races are longer so wear comes into play more often. Box is way bigger than necessary and the cube containers are built in annoying fashion for function in game play.

I really like how the goal is racing now, and it's not just a superficial change, as the ability to draft other cars allows for you to really take advantage of other players' positions especially at the higher player counts. While this interaction seems minor it actually can have huge ramifications on who bag builds the best. The cube building engine as a whole feels more combo-ey than Hyperborea because you need to chain your cubes correctly in order to maximize their movement (you are helped out in this regard by some cubes that let you manipulate which cubes go where). Also while initially you may be able to just gun off without buying too many cubes if you don't manage your bag well you will quickly sputter to a halt.

The modularity of which cubes have what effects I think could really open the way for fan-made cards.

This Game has fantastic mechanics - Bag builder (much like a deck builder) using coloured cubes and shade cubes (grey white brown etc) - The shade cubes are movement cubes and the coloured cube relate to 1 of 5 different cards with a special abilty that anyone can access. Each of these 5 cards has 3 other cards of the same colour which allows for a variety of gameplay. The board is also reversable with 2 different race tracks. This game plays well with 2 but is better with more though that will add more time to the game length. 
Doesn't have the feel of a real Nascar race like THUNDER ALLEY but would definately recommend this.

I gave this game a shot and as much as I love the theme and the "deckbuilding" aspect of it, I found the game to be AP prone and dull.  We played a 3 lap race with 5 people, which lasted slightly over an hour.  Most of the decision making is pretty clear cut and there isn't much strategy in the game as you often want to end up a road space that gives you many options.  While some of the effects of the different colored "cards" are nice, most of the effects boil down to "receive 1 wear, something happens"

Thematically wise, the game fails because you will sometimes have your road stop in the middle of a turn because you need to use a "garage" cube or pitstop.  At least in Road Kill Rally you had constantly worry about your speed and entering a turn while trying to ram Grandma.

It's not a terribly designed game, but I felt the game took too long for what it is.

The best deckbuilder-style game I've played. No tiresome sorting and shuffling. Great mix of strategy, luck and player interaction (especially with more players). Lots of different options from the cards. Often very exciting with everyone invested in the race until the end. If I had to criticise I'd say it's a bit of a jack of all trades, master of nothing type design.

Reminiscent of the old graph paper racing but with deck building built in.  The variable sized spaces and gameplay evokes the crowded and jostling turns in circus maximus, but without the tired logistical penpaper tracking.

  Replayability should be bolstered by the variable cards/courses.

As weird as it sounds to be designing your racecar as you race, it really works.  Very clean transition of movement cubes to the map spaces to track your turn.  

Only one play of a playtest version so no rating.  Want to play the finished game fo sho.

Update - played the published version.  Can safely rate it now.  It's excellent.  The drafting behind other cars mechanic is particularly evocative.  Game length is efficient even with 4 newish players.

I don't have many racing (as opposed to "race") games other than Formula D, which never gets played 'cos it takes too long to teach/play.

Well, it certainly works, it is well implemented as a bagbuilder. We had a close race with players following different strategies/buying different combinations of cubes. So it certainly works. That said, I am not great fan of bag/deckbuilding, nor race games, so take that into account if you judge my rating.

It's been a ton of fun playtesting the various iterations of this and I love this unique take on racing games.  I've wanted a good, strategic racing game for a long time but they generally depend on lucky dice rolls.  This one has an element of risk mitigation as well, but I love the feel of everyone "building" their own unique car with different strategies and capabilities.  Needing to manage wear is also a nice way to expand the decision tree without feeling like just another "feed your people" encumbrance.  Not many negatives - the limited cube supply can sometimes prevent you from buying a color you want later in the game, and those occasional turns where you get a bad pull and can't make any progress are a little frustrating, but that's no different from any deck-builder.  Overall a very fun new approach to the racing genre.

Clever take on bag-building. I didn't care for Hyperborea at all, especially the pace of it. Automobiles cycles through at a refreshing rate with ample opportunity for fine-tuning the composition of your bag. Balancing your gears against each other and the utility cubes combined with the variety of the track is pretty interesting. This is light but surprisingly fun, though it might depend on a couple more tracks (pnp?) to keep it fresh. Definitely worth a look as a fast-playing racing game without betting or dice.

A real twist on bag building games where you draw cubes out of a bag to power your racing car around the track gaining wear cubes which dilute your cubes.
Really clever mechanism with plenty of re-playability due to different power ups.

RATING: 8
Great bag building game where the cubes drawn decide how far you can move each turn. Building the right bag is very strategic and has a nice levels of tactical play every turn. The luck isn't too bad, as if you have a bum turn, then your next turn is likely very good. It's the most tactical at 2 players as you are the master of your own destiny. At higher numbers it's still a lot of fun due to more cars in the way on the track and more players to interact with. However, I worry that weaker players can accidentally help a player win through poor decisions. Still great fun though!

I really expected this to be better than it was due to the bag-building aspect. You draw a ton of cubes every round, so you never feel restricted by them. Unless you invest heavily into non-movement cubes, you're not going to feel like you have too many wasted turns. Also, using them to move around the track isn't that satisfying at all. The color-coded system is alright, but doesn't really capture the excitement of racing, in my opinion. Still, I'm not normally a fan of racing games, and this one was at least okay. Could have used a little more development though. A tighter system might have made me enjoy this more.

The first game of its genre I have ever played, a bag building game that uses the resources bought to power the car around the board, it actually works out to be quite thematic, and while I thought it could have been a lame attempt for a racing board game, it actually was a solid mechanic, and did enter into my favourites of all time.

Friends also enjoy it quite a bit, but the only small grief it gives would be the storage container itself. It tips over very easily on the table.

A surprisingly effective, and even thematic, blend of bag-building and a race game, with a coiled-spring pace to the game which should explode into life in the final few rounds.

Didn't really get into this one. Doesn't offer much new compared to existing deck/bag builders. I'd rather play Dominion, Orleans, etc. The usage of "gear" cube shades of gray to move along the track was interesting, but having to constantly refer to the cards to explain the cubes felt awkward (when deck builders have the powers right on the cards). 3 laps felt way too long on the Monza board - got bored half way through. Components are graphic design are nice enough.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

In Progress:

[i]Automobiles combines bag building with racing; I was excited to try this since I still haven't played a bag builder I really enjoy. Instead, after playing Automobiles, Orleans and Hyperborea,  I'm coming to the realization that I may not like the bag building mechanism all that much. I enjoyed Orleans the most and that was in large part because there were no waste cubes to deal with. I also found it annoying to constantly be referring to the rules cards for each different colored cube. 

Aside from that I found the game to be okay; I ended up running away with it because I had a bunch of one color cube that no one else had. Those cubes allowed me two wild movement with each of those cubes; it wasn't a satisfying way to win a game. I also found that in a 3p game there wasn't much jockeying for position, the track felt wide open and didn't have any choke points. As I mentioned before I'm not a fan of deck/bag builders that have some type of "waste" cube/card you need to manage. Having a turn where you pull a bunch of waste and can't do anything of consequence for a round is not fun at all and completely takes you out of the game. 

I know I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are based on my likes/dislikes of certain game mechanisms. I think there are a lot of folks who would really enjoy Automobiles, but for me there are other race games I much prefer. For a family weight race game I'd choose Flamme Rouge; for car racing I prefer Thunder Alley even though it is heavier and more difficult to learn.[/i]

It's fun for what it is.  I'm sure that we could get smarter about how to construct our bags, but it's no big deal in a breezy game like this with the kids.  Having a few super turns where someone moves all the way around the track or close to it are fun.  A few of the card powers are slightly complicated to figure out at first, but everyone soon understood and had fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nice blend of Dominion-style deck-building with the Monza mechanism, one of our all time favourite littlies' games (where you roll coloured dice and move along the spaces that match colours on the dice). Here you're pulling cubes out of a bag and advance along the coloured spaces matching your cubes. Cubes you don't spend moving give you money to buy more cubes, so there's some nice tradeoff decisions to make about whether to move or improve. The addition of cubes that allow additional types of actions, like boosts and repairs, provide more decisions on how to balance your cube/bag between movement cubes and action cubes. My fear is that it's a bit samey after a few laps, and despite the available actions being different from game to game, that it will nevertheless feel a bit samey from game to game as well. Still, enjoyable enough.

Delightful! Refreshing! In my top 100! Racing Game with "Deck"/Cube/Bag-Building! Good for Gamers. Good For Race-Game-Lovers. Good for Families! Good Good Good!! My favorite David Short design so far.

The game changes a bit when experienced people will increase the number of laps. More Goodness! So far my favorite way to play is with 4 laps.

I still have not found an optimal way to play 2  player games with the base game. The expansion has 2 very good smaller maps ideal for 2 to 3 players.

I like the mechanic of turning a deck building (or bag builder) into a racing game. I tend to find that racing games get a little dull as either random cards have a drastic effect or you have little control due to dice or card draw. But in here you build you cars abilities and can add and remove them as you wish. You can plan your moves and focus on a strategy. Of course you are subject to your draw but that is somewhat under your control as you chose what cubes are in your bag and can even remove the ones you start with. The mechanic is simple, as with most deck builders, as you pull seven cubes and use them to move your car or buy new cubes / discard existing cubes. Seven laps may be excessive but otherwise a fun racing game with a euro feel.

For some reason, the rulebook to me is not the clearest. I had issues with lateral movement, action cubes and a couple other things.

It's a solid game although I don't believe the cubes help the game outside of actual movement. Cards would have been a much better option and made the game much quicker due to not knowing all the action cards and having to constantly look at each card every time you want to do something with a cube.

bag building cube game. Different colored cubes do different things it could have easily been used with cards. It was a nice idea. I felt it fell flat for me and I just didn't like it all that much.

Pleasant bag-builder which is the descendant of Monza and Dominion. Movement was oddly fitful: one turn you're cruising almost a whole lap; the next, lucky if you made it two segments. I know similar things happen in Dominion, but to see it visually represented was quite weird. Enjoyable, but in the recommended starting setup, the combo of Hybrid Engine and Pit Crew (?) lapped other cars in a three lap race.

RATING: 6
This is a bag building game about racing cars. It uses the game concept that the faster you are going, the more brown cubes you get, which clog up your future bag pulls. This can be avoided if you pull up right behind someone, so it seems like it's meant to balance the leader. The problem with this is if one player gets a bad turn or two in a row due to luck of their draws, the player in the lead can lap and follow the player in last, thereby removing what should be their penalty for being first, while the player in last is taking brown cubes with each move as they can't catch up to the next player in front of them. The luck of the draw is a major factor in this game, more than I'm comfortable with. I'm also not a fan of games that ask you to have these boom or bust turns, where you can either do a thing, or remove clog cubes. I also found that similar to other race to the finish games, your engine gets built in the first few turns and then you stop making interesting decisions as you just execute your deck and hope for the best.

Wow, I had a blast.Is this a deep strategy game? nope. But it puts a great spin on deck building. It's obviously bag building, but what I mean is this game makes you think that you are actually doing something besides deckbuilding, and you really feel like you are racing. I love theme, and I can honestly say, I have rarely been as engaged in theme as this one. Now it is just one play. I might have just been in a good mood and been in the moment, but it was fun. Would love to play this one again. Got downforce on order though, and the reviews are saying it's the best racing game out here. Otherwise I would probably add this one to the wishlist. I'll find out after I play Downforce and hopefully remember to update this. Just know, if you are looking for a light-medium racing game try this one out.

A race game that uses bag-building! Extremely fun. I like how you are customizing your car and building up wear as you push your car to it's limits... and then use your pit crew to get rid of it. I'm not sure I like all of the options for each of the types of cubes, but it does make the game have a large amount of variability and replayability. I'd also like to see more maps come out. I have heard about an expansion coming out, but it packs it with the expansion for Planes and Trains which therefore makes the price point too high since I don't own those other two.

I still want to play this one as I try to play as many "racing" games as I can, but I'm not going to hunt this one down.  It really seems like a bag-builder with a pasted-on theme. Apart from some effects based on being in last place, etc. it's basically a solitaire affair.  Which is fine, but then I'll play Rallyman, which does a better job of pasting a mechanic (sequencing dice) onto a racing simulation. And if I want tons of optimization/customization, I'll play Steampunk Rally, where even though there's a ton of dice rolling, you're much less at the mercy of luck than drawing cubes from a bag.  I like cube drawing, but more when it's used Feld-like to determine actions available to all players.  I'm also not a big fan of Daytona 500 games (e.g. Thunder Alley).

Out of the 3 Destination Fun games, this is my favorite. I never knew how much fun using cubes instead of cards for a deck builder could be. It just feels so right drawing cubes and placing them on the board as you plot out how far your little car can go. The only negative I have noticed is that 5 player games can run a bit long. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cube management that's not much to do with simulating car racing, but it's fun never-the-less. I think I prefer it over Trains. Here the cards are substituted with cubes that are associated with certain card actions. The gears are what drives you forward, but there are a bunch of other card options each game that will have you figuring out what works with which track and which race length. Then you've got your standard waste/wear cards filling your hand with useless junk that you've got to try and work around or get rid of.

The big difference between this and Trains is that unlike the most points count at the end of there game here you have a first car past the line finish. This is excellent. All the preceding turns are about setting yourself up for the big sprint at the end. (It almost feels like a bike race.) You'll be drafting, clearing out your wear cubes, buying higher gears and special abilities. It's all about crossing the line first, so you'll make suboptimal moves to position yourself for the end. This makes the game rather good.

I like how you can (with the right cards) start off the game with the low gears and then work your way up to higher gears and some special action cards. The cube pulling is much preferable to the constant Trains/Dominion card shuffling. Of course the board helps tremendously with the theme. That said, even with the blocking and board movement this doesn't feel much like I'm racing cars. It's fun though and it plays super quick.

2016: 8. Starting out at 8, suspect it will sit here with more plays.  Played only a couple of times and very much enjoyed this "cube builder".  As I "built my bag" I really got the feeling I was actually building an actual "engine"!  And differences between early game and late game bag composition gives a nice feeling of "shifting" into a "higher gear" that feels so much more thematic than something like Dominion. (Dominion is still great though)

Not sure yet whether I'll get my own copy, but right now I'll definitely play it if its suggested!

bag-building works smoothly with the board racing theme, luck of the draw could be a factor but it is a 'deck-builder' after all and there are bag-tweaking mechanisms, but it is a bit disheartening to always manage to draw the cube that interacts with the discard pile when you don't yet have a discard pile

Solid bag-building game with some excellent use of mechanics and theme.  It's a deckbuilding game using cubes that somehow is able to simulate a race, and it does a good job doing it.  I'm not in love with the game, but I'll play it anytime because it's a genius system.

Interesting bag-building game where the dice power your car around the race track. It has a variable setup in several dimensions:
- a specific color could mean something different every game (except, of course, the white, light gray, dark gray, and black, which always correspond to track movement along matching color bands). 
- there are 2 different tracks in the base game: a simple oval (Daytona) where you can just go FAST, and Monza, which  has more turns and bottlenecks requiring more deck (bag) management
- you can decide the number of laps to run the race (game ends at end of round when someone has finished; furthest past finish line wins)
The variety should help keep things more interesting. Ultimately, though, I'm not sure the base game has enough variation in cube powers to hold interest for a long time. Of course, I'm sure that it's expandable by simply adding new powers and/or tracks. Will have to try it face to face some time ....

Like trains before it, it takes a basic deck building model and spices it up with a board to give your "card" play more depth. There doesn't feel like very much variety though so your deck just plays itself after a lap or two. 

Unfortunately this one tries to disguise boring bag optimization with a board as most builders with a board do.

Pros: Solid racing game so far. Love placing cubes on the track to determine movement. Really believe a potential expansion could put this one over the edge for me.

Cons: Only real hinderance right now is color-blind people will not enjoy this game. My friend is color blind and he gets real frustrated not being able to tell what cubes he's pulled.

Final thought: This is almost like a perfect gateway deck builder. Light and thematic enough to teach people the deck/pool building mechanic.

Having now played Automobiles three times, I can't honestly say that it isn't *entirely* bullshit. It certainly has a very high level of bullshit, but it is also surprisingly entertaining. There are a lot of combinations that can be built which are enormous (it is entirely possible to do a lap and a half even without using the 'faster' builds) and the game can be over much faster than people realise.

In summary, it is a clever bag builder, with a moderate level of randomness and more strategy than is perhaps apparent in a first play.

Deck/bag builder games are ok if the deck/bag building serves a purpose. Here the purpose is to probel cars around a track. That makes the game so much more enjoyable than deckbuilding for the sake of deckbuilding (ie Dominion).

Sure the game might not be a solid racing simulator and you need a bit of luck with the draw, but it is a fun and exciting game.

Automobiles uses an interesting combination of racing and bag building.  Overall, I really enjoyed the racing aspect.  It uses an interesting gear management system with 4 different gears that advance you on certain areas of the track.  It also handles drafting pretty smoothly as you avoid suffering any wear if you end your turn behind someone else.

However, I have two complaints with the game.  My first complaint is that there are a lot of abilities that interact with your discard pile.  Deckbuilders inherently have a lot of luck, but using this mechanic adds to the luck because they are useless if you draw them when you have no discard pile.  My second complaint is that, like all deck builders, downtime becomes an issue with more than ~3 players.  But in a racing game, you generally want to have more players to race with.  So, I'm not sure the whole racing/deckbuilding combination is meant to be.

I'd play it again, but not seek it out.

Automobiles es un juego de coches de carreras con una mecánica de Deckbuilding, solo que en vez de coleccionar cartas, coleccionaremos cubitos de colores que se almacenan en una bolsa grande roja, y ésta funciona como si fuese nuestro mazo. Cada turno robaremos 7 cubitos de la bolsa que serán nuestra mano de juego. Con estos cubos ejecutaremos acciones y progresaremos por la pista. Hay cubos de Marchas para correr por la pista y cubos de Acciones que serán distintas en cada partida según el grupo de cartas seleccionadas previamente. Hay también una Fase de Compra de nuevos cubos y una Fase de Desgaste de nuestro coche. En definitiva, es como cualquier Deckbuilding: debes gestionar bien tu Bolsa de Cubos (mazo) para que éste sea eficiente y los cubos que robes sean los que te lleven más lejos en la pista. Este un juego rápido, interactivo, fácil de jugar y de explicar. Si te gustan los Deckbuildings y las Carreras de Coches, este es tu juego.

Not color blind friendly at all. I'm only slightly color blind but I still had a little bit of trouble with some of the darker cubes. I'm sure it would be hard to make this game color blind friendly considering there are 10 different colors of cubes, but it appears that no effort at all was made to do so.

Additionally, having one set of reference cards was a little annoying. Most of the abilities are simple enough that you internalize them after a few rounds, but it seems like it would have been feasible to include four extra copies of each card so that each person could have their own set to look through during the lengthy downtime.

About the gameplay, it's not bad but nothing exceptional. I need more plays to be sure, but it seems like the luck of the draw can be more significant than in other deckbuilders. In this game you need the right cubes at just the right time to move along the track, and if you don't get them it can be a pretty big setback. Alternatively, if someone does get just the right draw they can really jump ahead.

Still, not a bad entry into the bag-building genre and a step up from Trains.

Very good game. The basis is very inventive, basically a deckbuilder where the deck is replaced by a bag of cubes representing various actions and the scoreboard is replaced by one of two racetracks. Look forward to playing more and hope some expansions are in the pipeline. Games play very quickly and it's easy to teach.

Half a point deduction for its components: the artwork and graphic design are a bit amateurish looking, and a couple of my wooden components were chipped. My copy is even missing a draw bag! Despite this, I still really like the game - it is very easy to explain, and quite interactive for a pool building game. Really want to play again!

RATING: 6
Fascinating blend of bag-builder and race game. I really like that the cube powers can catapult you ahead if you play recklessly, and since wear cubes are more annoyance than hindrance, stepping on the gas feels exhilarating rather than frightening.

If there's one drawback, it's that playing with more than 2p can cause the game to drag. Any given turn can go by at a good pace, but the extra minute to finesse things adds up with more players at the table. I imagine this game plays best in an online implementation, where physical setup/play/tear-down is at a minimum.

Bag-building elegance: fun game with a nice flow to it. I  have few complaints - even the sometimes mentioned runaway leader problem doesn't seem worse than in other deckbuilders (it's just that scoring in those games can be hidden while the track position in Automobiles is there for all to see. This can mean that sometimes, by the final lap you can tell who is winning).

I just need 'Planes' to complete my collection. I may separate the tops on the storage containers.. they are getting in my way. I think 'Planes' will be my favorite out of the trio. This is ok, but I'm really no fan of the 'Dominion' drafting mechanic, or 'Dominion', for that matter. 'Trains' is better. 'Thunderstone' is my pick out of the bunch. But, no more. Kathy likes it, so, that's a plus.

This solves a lot of my issues with deck builders.  It's fast, clean, and has a much more tactile and visual aid towards what you're building.  Added bonus that the feel of a deck builder is centered around what does feel like a tense race where people can jump ahead at any moment.

I enjoyed it quite a bit, but as with most deck builders that it has evolved from... it's still not something that really excites me to play it.  There's more interaction than most, but it's still a game where everyone is staring at their own board.

Love the cube-building vs. deck-building aspect.  Cubes keeps the game flowing at a quick pace and a nice tactile feel over cards.  The cube-building also meshes very well with the theme.  I only wish the cube abilities were better balanced and the game had more tracks (there are only two).

Deck building with cubes is a really cool mechanic but this game feels very long. Also, best at 4 for maximum blocking and cube denial. Just OK at 3. really like racing around the track and the execution. More limited than trains in that there is a set variety of cubes which carry out set actions so this game is not really that replayable beyond the initial handful of plays. Will probably never want to own a copy of this, which is a shame since I really wanted to complete my trains, planes, automobiles box collection :/

RATING: 7
This was much better than I expected. I can't say that it feels like stockcar racing as the game's theme suggests, because the turns are sort of slow and calculated and the cars move so far each turn. Regardless of that particular failing, the game that is here is still fun and engaging.

The upgrade cubes you can buy for your race car have a nice variety of effects that combo together in all sorts of different ways to generate big exciting moves. Track movement is simple, yet there are a couple of easy to remember exceptions that make positioning situationally important. This adds just enough of a wrinkle to stop turns from being executed on auto-pilot, yet never does it get in the way of smooth play.

The only real complaint I have is only having two tracks in the box. Admittedly, the tracks function more like a scoring path than anything else, since the decision space and gameplay all take place on the player boards and upgrade market. Extra tracks would probably be a little extraneous, but it still feels weird for a racing game to have so little track variety.

All that being said, the real question is "How does this compare to other auto-racing games out there?". Well, as for me, I'd say that Thunder Alley is probably the best stock car game out there, so Automobiles is certainly not better than that. Formula De still captures the thrill of racing via its push your luck die rolls and corner rules better than everything else and as such, it does a much better job than Automobiles of putting you in the role of a hot-shot driver. So really, it's sort of a distant third. Yet that sort of undersells how much fun it is.

I think it might be better to compare this to the other deck-builders or bag-builders in your collection. Most of the play occurs in that arena, so it is probably easier to decide whether it warrants a spot on those merits instead of the racing ones.

This uses a clever mechanism for racing that combines the typical bag-building customization with an end goal that does not rely on accumulating victory points. However, the theme of auto racing doesn't really grab me, and the art/components are nothing special. It can also be frustrating when the player draws cubes out of the bag and can do nothing to advance the car with them because they're all the wrong colors.

Pouch builder oval track race. Random setup of different tracks and race support cards. Race system driven by drawing and spending cubes pulled from the bag. I like games that have a reset action that forces players to optimize rounds. The race system has different size squares around the track to compensate for the longer travel distance around the outside lanes coupled with the wear mechanic--brilliant. I'm fascinated with pouch builders and have been working on a racing game myself. This one elegantly overcomes many of the obstacles I was facing. Kudos! It's just a simple race game but there is plenty of good strategy depth and positioning interaction with other players. Fun.

RATING: 6
I generally enjoyed this, but it kind of "spins its wheels" after a few turns. Sure, you're adding cubes to the bag to give yourself more options, but the play almost always seems obvious based on what you have. It's cool to make the choices on building the bag, but turns do start feeling fairly familiar.

Not necessarily a bad thing, but it definitely makes me not want to play the game in its longer iterations. Kudos for the card variety (which we should've used more in the game I played), scaleable game length and nice bags. Demerits for the bad gradation on the car spaces, as the "dotted line" is barely visible in parts. Bad graphic design there.

I'd probably play it once in a while.

Better than [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121408/trains]Trains[/url], to be sure.  I'd rather choke on hobo-lovin' coal fumes than ride that rail again.

In game #1 of Automobiles (shortened to 5 laps), I got off to a slow start and could never catch up, but I was outclassed by my betters and have nobody but myself to blame.  I was schooled in the art of yellow cube manipulation, and I will apply my newfound knowledge in the next race.

The designers wisely allow the powers of the colored cubes to vary each game, just to prevent a 'perfect bag' strategy.  Even then I wonder if there isn't an ideal cube distribution, since a particular color always has the same general class of power.  

And those purple cubes are awfully powerful, to the point where their strong presence seems unavoidable.  If you care about winning, anyway.

Went in worrying it would be awful, like Planes, but instead it was delightful. A bit hard to get right from the get go as you have to look at your cubes and then the cards to know exactly what you have to play with. But after a couple of turns it's easy and you can plan ahead while the other players are moving and the game just moves along beautifully. Loved it so much that I bought my own copy!

Just love this game.  Very easy rules and with the timer running you kind of go nuts.  Great game for new players.  Suggest using a real timer so no single person must watch the sand run out.  I use a swiming lap timer that works really great.

From the Reviews: I nice little puzzle game, very fast play time for 2 player, plays up to four, a little bit of abstract. A game for my wife and I and a game as a filler. That it one cool game. The title made me think "dumb" but I finally read the review and I am glad I did. I think this game is very eligible for purchase!

It's name could be Tetris: The Boardgame. Just as in the videogame, you have different geometrical elements which you have to combine to fit in pre-defined shapes. Of course, there is a time limit of one minute. The winner then collects a number of crystals from the player board and whoever at the end of nine rounds has collected the most gems in a single color wins. It is a good party game for four players, fast paced and fun. There are quite a lot of combination to be used, so it is very hard to remember how each puzzle is solved.

Very nice spacial puzzle game. It's easy enough that  you can teach it in a few minutes max but still offers enough fun and challenge that it doesn't get boring. The combination of lots of puzzle cards and the mechanism to use different pieces on any given puzzle card ensure plenty of replayability. I also like that the game is not just about who can solve the puzzle the fastest, in fact sometimes you don't want to be the first done. Nice touch in a game like this. My 7 year old loves this game and even the 5 year old enjoys helping to solve the puzzles. This is one of those rare games that will work with just about any players, young or old and in any combination, and still allow the younger players to regularly win. 

I have altered the rules a bit to accommodate the kids. As long as you can finish the puzzle before time runs out you get to take crystals you do not have to get the crystals before time runs out. To avoid knocking the crystals all over we take turns in the order that the players finished the puzzle once everyone is done with their puzzle. It's a minor rule change but can prevent a lot of mayhem.

Nice puzzle solving game. Super easy to teach and play. Players have some Tetris-like pieces and each round they try to solve a mini puzzle as quickly as possible because there solving it first gives you more options on which gem to take. There is also a time limit so if you fail to solve your puzzle then you dont take a gem. After a set amound of rounds the player who has the most gems of a single colour wins.

The design of this game is worthy and it undoubtedly has some broad appeal.  Racing to complete "shape puzzles" can definitely be fun in a frothy "hurry up!" sort of way, but in my experience, games like this often result in pointlessly bruised feelings for gamers who are simply not lightening fast in their ability to complete "shape puzzles."  

For those who are lightening fast, this game might be enjoyable as you dominate others, and for those like myself who are very close to lightening fast much of the time, I suppose I could enjoy beating those who are not.  For some reason though, I am just not yet convinced that this particular skill makes me better in any way, and as such winning doesn't feel particularly enjoyable.  I can see the jewel mechanic trying to ameliorate this, but it doesn't work well.

{1 play, 4 player} If you like trying to fit 4 tangrams into a specific space in under a minute, you still may not be crazy for this game, as the picking-gems scoring system was no great shakes.  Still, it was okay once, and halfway through we made Jeff Sumner do two boards to our one because he was so good at it... and he still finished first a few times!

it's hard to fairly rate this one.  while the difficulty seems to vary wildly from card to card, that's something that can probably be faded with experience.  as a puzzle solving race, it's really quite decent.  as a complete game with scoring, it's random and it even seems plausible that the best player at the game could lose due to gem ordering.  we were told about a drafting variant that seems better, but i think i'd rather strictly keep score based the order in which people finished.  that seems logical, but maybe something along those lines would be too cutthroat for families.

For fans of puzzles or tetris, this is a good puzzling game.  Each round the players attempt to use specific pieces to make a particular layout depicted on the card.  The first to do so wins the round and gets to choose a gem.  The gems are used as the scoring mechanism.  While the scoring seems out of place, the puzzles are remarkably challenging.  [GTI: APSD]

Un buen juego de hacer el chorra con no jugones. Consiste en resolver pequeños puzzles en formna de tetris en el menor tiempo posible. Cada jugador resuelve el suyo propio y todos a la vez mientras el tiempo corre... el que lo consiga primero tendrá la posibilidad de recoger cuentas de colores, probablemente las que el quiera... el resto y por orden de rapidez cojerá el resto. El que más cuentas de un color consiga gana. Sencillo de explicar, entra por lo ojos, y simpre crea risas... A mí me gusta pero es para lo que es. ¿Harto del Monopoly? ¿y de los partys de toda la vida?, pues esta es la solución...

It is a fantastic game.
It is a puzzle solver in real time.
The most fun is when you finish early and you watch someone else agonize over their puzzle until the timer runs out.

The best part of this game is that it takes less than 20 minutes even with setup. A huge plus in my book.

RATING: 7
Nice game but I have some quibbles - solving puzzles is rather accidental - everyone's rotating their pieces in different random positions in hope to get it right somehow, not much skill involved. Maybe in some harder versions it doesn't work that way any more but in the base game it looks like it's the best way to tackle them, it's really a rare sight to see someone not solving his puzzle. The scoring which at first glance looks like an interesting game in itself after some time feels maybe a bit too convoluted for what's it worth.

[i]Posted: 1/4/08, Rated: 8[/i]
{2P: 8, 3P: 8, 4P: 9}

At first blush, here is yet another game which looks an awful lot like [i]Tetris[/i].  This style of game has been done before with [i][gameid=2453][/i], and to a lesser extent with [i][gameid=6411][/i].  However, peeking under the mask reveals a different take on the puzzle genre.

In [i]Ubongo[/i], each player gets her own set of puzzle pieces, and plays them on her own card each round.  This isn't a directly-competitive game where pieces can block each other.  Instead, it is a race to see who can fill all of the spaces on his card first, using the prescribed pieces as determined by a die roll.  A sand timer is provided to keep the game moving briskly.

There is a scoring mechanism bolted onto the puzzling.  It feels disconsonant at first, but after a small number of plays it makes perfect sense.  It also provides an incentive to finish first, as the added mobility it provides can be crucial to enhancing your score.

[i]Ubongo[/i] is at its best when played with the full complement of four.  It has been a solid hit with every person to whom I have introduced it.  We have given copies as a house-warming gifts, and it has been requested by friends visiting from out of town.  Spear yourself a copy while you still can.

A real time puzzle game that has quite a bit of strategy in it. Putting the puzzles together is the main part of the game, but the strategy comes in with moving your pawn and collecting the jewels from the right row to collect the most of 1 color. And of course preventing your opponents from doing the same. A great game to introduce new people to the hobby and a winner with kids and adults.

A very good real-time puzzle-solving game.  The scoring system is well designed, making it possible for even the slowest solvers to compete.  We don't usually play that you have to claim your gems in the time limit, but if you have 4 good puzzle-solvers you can do that.  The funniest moments are when a seasoned puzzle-solver fails to solve and refuses to move on until they see that the pieces do work in the puzzle they were given.

The timer may be a little short for people who aren't good at fast puzzle-solving.  I have played with several people who could easily solve these puzzles, but when this time limit is forced on them they choke.  It may be necessary with some groups to play with a slightly more forgiving time limit.  Aside from that this game is a real winner for everybody.

Cute puzzle and speed game.  The puzzles are a bit too easy, even the advanced ones.  The balance is a bit off since some puzzles are a lot trickier than others.  Also, the scoring mechanic of picking up gems is unbalanced, and sometimes the colors that you need are nearly impossible to get.  Apparently, Ubongo Extreme fixes these problems.

RATING: 7
I like these kinds of puzzles and like the jewel collection mechanics, but I dislike trying to figure out who yelled Ubongo first and fighting with opponent's hands moving pawns on the red track.  The jewels are hard to grab too, so if someone who starts grabbing before you is taking their sweet time it can be hard to get at the jewels you are due before the timer runs out... and did I make it before the timer ran out?!?!?  I say "yes" but one opponent says "no way!"  ugh.  I like playing the puzzles under the time limit, but will probably just let the players take jewels in order of solves and forget about the timer during jewel taking. (but really discourage jewel "counting" or other AP problems when taking jewels.)

Great, great family game. Even my 5 year old can compete with the adults and he even wins at times! Game takes about 15 minutes to play. Only downside is that it only supports up to 4 players. 6 players would have been even better.

12/12/06 - got this to the table tonight 2/1/07. Fantastic game! Played two games with my 13 and 11 year old. They wanted to play it again but it was getting late. We played the easier side of the tile boards (3 piece puzzles). This is spatial recognition ala Tetris style. The dice roll directs you to which pieces you must use to fill in the shape on your tile board and a sand timer is flipped which provides the tension to beat the clock. Great stuff! Plays unlike anything else in my game collection. Really happy to own this gem. It has gems too!

El sistema de puntuación de esta primera edición es del todo injusto, puedes haber ganado menos paneles que otros jugadores y aun así ganar la partida en función de las piedras que te encuentres en tu camino, lo que es del todo arbitrario. De ahí que le baje la puntuación. 
Creo que este problema se intenta corregir en la segunda edición.

I really enjoyed the main mechanics of this game, but I found the gem selection part of the game to be incredibly bad.  I'd love to try it with the variant that allows you to draft gems.  But the rules as written make the activity great, but the game is a clunker.

RATING: 7
Speed spatial puzzles.  'Nuff said.  You will either enjoy that kind of thing or you won't.  I do.  The board mechanism is pretty superfluous and probably worth ditching.  In fact in the first game I played we just randomly drew gems equal to 2x the number of players and had players take whatever 2 gems they wanted from that pile in the order in which they finished the puzzle.  Worked great!

If you like speed games, this is a fantastic one.  Very aesthetic too.  I can't give any speed game a really good score though, because some people just can't have fun with them.

RATING: 5
You really need a certain type of group for this, but if you all loves puzzles it can be entertaining. I really like that timer matters for everything you do, not just the puzzles. It gives you good incentive to finish your puzzle as fast as possible and then you have more time to carefully decide which row to pick from and when to pick from it. Knowing when to let your opponents make the first move can be key. All in all it plays quickly (and very fast-paced!), light, interesting decisions, and pretty bits, but just doesn't have that spark that makes me want to play it often.

There is a game in there somewhere.  The scoring mechanism ruins things for me.  And the gems even had the non-colorblind people mumbling about the choices in colors.  I couldn't see 'em.  I just tried to complete the puzzles.  I did pretty well in the puzzle solving.  Still lost.

Board game Tetris!  Like many action games, this one is pretty dependent on practice and on experience with action games.

Solitaire style puzzles played in a race against the other players (a la Ricochet Robots or Set).  Those with superior spatial reasoning skills will do well.

On the other hand, it is quick enough that I don't think it wears out its welcome - I just can't see playing it too frequently.

Its an attractively produced puzzle-game. The scoring track creates a bit more of a logical puzzle in which the person finishing first has a minor advantage....although may not be the person that ends up winning if they can't get the right color gems (or are careless). 

I like the asthetics of the game, and its a nice change of pace. But I doubt the puzzle theme will hold my interest for long. A good gateway game, perhaps?

Ubongo is a little spatial puzzle game that involves a race between the players and a bit of an odd scoring system that takes place on a sub-board. On their turn, players flip over a tile that shows the smaller tiles configured in a given shape, but with 6 different options for the tiles that can be used to make that shape. A die is rolled, and people are off to the races trying to make that shape. The game is timed to one minute, and faster finishers have first dibs on the victory gems, which are the base of a simple victory point system: biggest single colour wins, if a tie exists, second colours, &c. The gem track is a strange system, and at times it could encourage people to sandbag, waiting for someone else to clear out lucrative gems in front of them. Strange.

So this is a pretty basic puzzle game. I think the problem with this is the same problem that exists with Ricochet Robots and a lot of other games in this genre: it requires, as JC puts it, a muscle that heretofore did not exist. Once you are able to start thinking in the Ubongo shapes, the game would be very, very easy. I recognize that being good at this game would be as simple as sitting down with a copy and memorizing the shapes and thinking about how they lock together in my spare time. Like Ricochet, the player who has played the game the most will likely be at a huge advantage though, as they should be able to visualize the pieces forming the shape more easily.

At the end of the day, Ubongo doesn't bother me nearly as much as Ricochet because at least I can have the satisfaction of cobbling my own puzzle together in this instead of having some whiz pull off that 16 move solution in 1 minute flat. That said, I don't care for competitive puzzles like this all that much. If my brain liked them, I would probably just have them out and play them by myself, because I don't think the other players add a lot to the game. Though Ubongo has a scoring system tacked on, I think it is largely superfluous and not all that interesting...this game is going to live and die by the competitive spatial puzzle solving action, and for me, that scores a "meh."

Great puzzle game!  Right up my alley, and a great game to play with non-gamers too.  I love the fact that you can handicap the game a bit with kids or with other players who who may not be as quick to recognize the spatial relationships between the pieces.  Just have one player use the 4-piece side and one use the 3-piece side.  Thanks to Beowulf for the recommendation!

The main part of this game is the familiar tangram model but with a timer that puts the pressure on to solve your puzzle fast, and first.  The strategy then becomes to try and collect gems from a random field to get the most in a few colors.

No depth here, but the fun of solving puzzles quickly (and helping each other out when you're stuck) is a good group activity.  Makes for a nice break from heavier fare.  The bright colors and distinctive art are a nice touch.

I bought this game in my ongoing quest to find games my girlfriend will play with me. After I discovered that she like multiplayer-solitaire puzzle (FITS I'm looking at you), Ubongo was my next purchase. As I expected, she liked this one very much. The only thing that took her some time to get used to was the scoring. I guess, this could have been a little non-gamer friendly.

All in all, I do enjoy an occasional game of Ubongo. It's surprisingly satisfying to solve the puzzles faster than everyone else, or in my case, before the timer runs out. If you are like me, then your brain is not really wired for stuff like this. I'm in no way a competition for my girlfriend or anyone else. For me, it's more a race against the timer than everyone else.

Players race the sand timer to complete their own 3 or 4 piece tangram puzzles.  If they solve it they get to grab a couple of gems off the scoreboard.  After nine rounds, whoever has the most gems of a single colour wins.  That's it - very simple, but rather run game.  Half puzzle, half party game.  The 3 piece puzzles are very easy, while the 4 piece puzzles are much more difficult.

Idea:
Solve tetris on your gameboard before anyone else to get diamonds first from a set of rows. Collect same colored diamonds to score points.

Mechanism:
Boards have easier and harder puzzle side and you have timeglass to measure amount of time to solve puzzle. First one gets to pick from wider area of diamonds so its advantage.

to who:
If you like tetris and want easy to learn game. I cant understand why this got game of year rating here and has really not too good replay value.

You place tiles, but it's not a Euro game. :)

The players have a limited time to arrange their Tetris-style pieces in a certain shape. The fastest players get the most points (in the form of jewels, and I really like the VP track and the random grab bag). 

Might be really frustrating for people with poor spatial skills.

Also the 3-D version is great but doesn't seem to have been printed in my country.

A fun game that reminds me of the few fun parts of geometry class.  Not sure about the gem scoring thing, the game itself is a fun enough activity and any fun or strategies with the gems is never the reason you want to play again.

It's Tangoes with Tetris pieces.  The clock is FAST in this game, so speed is everything.   Thankfully the game is really short, too, so the fun level matches the frustration level.  A good puzzle game for people who aren't necessarily a fan of puzzle games.  Really weird scoring system, I'm not sure that it makes sense, but the game can still be fun to play even if you stink at it.  And I stink at it.

[8 plays] This is a good game once you discard the fatally flawed scoring system.  I like the puzzle-solving that's at the heart of the game.  Ubongo has the suspense and fast pace of other puzzle games like Set or Ricochet Robot, but it improves on their biggest weakness, which is that less skilled players never get to do anything.  In Ubongo, you may not have a chance to win if everyone else is a lot better at it than you, but at least you have your own puzzle to work on and can feel like you’re always engaged in the game. And I think the scheme with the roll of the die dictating your choice of puzzle pieces is a good one, and gives the game replayability while keeping it evenly balanced.  You can handicap the game a bit, should you so wish, by having some players use the harder 4-piece side of the boards and some the easier 3-piece side.  And you can control the length of the game by choosing how many boards to play.  Ubongo is quite well-produced, and I really like the design and art of the game.

The big thing I don't like about Ubongo is the scoring system.  I think the underlying problem is an attempt to be all things to all people.  It's as if the designer couldn't decide if they were creating a game of chance or a game of skill.  Of course most games have some blend of the two elements, but with a puzzle game, winning the game ought to depend on your ability to solve puzzles.  Here it seems like they've tried to even the playing field by introducing a crazy random element with the scoring.  And that just doesn't seem right.  It's as if the rules to Set or Ricochet Robot said that the first person to solve the puzzle got to roll a die to see who got the points for it. 

I really dislike the fact that the timer applies to the scoring.  For one thing, that just seems silly and inappropriate.  For another, I think this system really encourages scoring mistakes.  The more players you have, the more confusing it could be to keep straight who'd Ubongoed first and how many pieces your pawn was allowed to move in the scoring phase.

But buried under this broken mess of a scoring system is a fun game.  I recommend just scrapping the scoring and devising a more reasonable system of one's own, and then having a good time with the puzzles.  Our approach is to completely discard the scoring track board and pawns, and just play that first person to finish in an x-player game gets x-1 gems, then each subsequent player 1 gem less till the last, who gets nothing.  Color of gems no longer matters; at the end you just count up how many you have and whoever has the most wins.

(As of [b]5[/b] plays) A fast-paced puzzle-solving game with extremely simple rules. Scoring is a bit obtuse in order to level the playing field, and some people find the timed puzzle-solving element too stressful. Fun for those who enjoy these types of puzzles, frustrating for those who don't.

Quick (20 mins) and easy with simple rules. I like puzzles so I like this game.  A nice twist to this game, if a player is always last to solve the puzzle, they still can win because the winner is the one with the most of the same colored gem. we don't use the timer because we played with younger children so everyone gets the same number of gems (the last one doesn't doesn't even need to finish the puzzle to collect their gems.)  

The gem board has a severe problem.  It is a light-weight board in 2 pieces that fits together like a puzzle piece.  My boards are slightly warped and the result is that they move around and dislodge the gems.  Part of the play is that a player must pick up gems before the timer goes off.  Players are in a hurry, yet the gems are difficult to pick up and with the slightest bump a player is trying to put back gems in their proper place for the next player to pick up theirs.  A terrible design flaw on a very nice game.

We love this game! The puzzle building aspect is a blast! (if you like puzzles of this type). The production of this game is awesome and really draws attention! Use tetris type pieces to fill in totally a shape. A die roll decides what pieces you get to use. The timer controls the rounds. You must complete the entire round within the time. This includes finding the pieces you are using this round, building the puzzle, calling your completion, moving your pawn, and collecting the gems. If the timer runs out at any time before you complete them all, you are out of luck.

What a pleasant surprise!  Being a fan of Tetris, I had a feeling I would enjoy this puzzler, but it exceeded expectations.  I think of it as Turbo Taxi with rewards for finishing after the first person is done.  Excellent fun, but it's a good thing the timer is so fast.

So frustrating when the pieces just don't fit, but I still like this game a lot.  Some people find this game VERY frustrating, but most will at least consider it a worthy challenge and still want to try it again.

It's starting to get somewhat boring, but I still like the challenge for now.  The jewels aspect is ridiculous...doesn't fit the game at all.

Tha game has its ups and downs. Original idea and simple rules make it a great entertainment for almost everyone.

But for playing from time to time - it's just perfect. And it's funny what makes up for some minor gripes.

I love the puzzle part of this game.  And I like that it comes with so many boards and there are 6 different sets of pieces for each board based on a die roll.  I also like that the boards have an easy side and a more difficult side. I don't like the scoring mechanism at all though. If I play a puzzle game I want to be rewarded for being the fastest/best. The scoring mechanism with the game feels like it was just thrown in to give people who aren't so good at the 1st part more of a chance.  We play where the first person done gets 3 gems, the 2nd person gets 2, the 3rd person gets 1, and 4th gets nothing. With our scoring changes I give the game a 10. (with the original, a 6).

It's nothing more than a race to solve simple tangrams, but it's fun.  It works well because everyone has a different puzzle to solve during the same round.  Sneaking a peek at your neighbor's board won't help, and you won't feel as stupid when you're the last one to finish, because your puzzle might have been tougher that round (or at least that's what you'll tell everyone).  I also like the fact that every player who solves their puzzle will get two gems for the round, no matter how quickly or slowly they do it.  This helps keep the morale high for those who aren't necessarily the speed demons of the table.

I'd much rather play this fine game than something mass market like Guesstures, Pictionary, etc.  Nice gem bits, eventhough plastic, like better than common glass drops.

I think I like Das Duel better because you are working on the same puzzle together and the scoring on this one confused my youngest and seemed to be something that didn't need to exist in the game.  Although, maybe it was added to add more stress to the game with the 'easy' sides seeming to be quite easy.

Most of the time we do not play by the rules picking jewels from the track, just counting how many tiles you completed the fastest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fine game, but not really my thing.  For a no-luck game, the gem scoring really doesn't work.  You can win all the puzzle races, and still lose the game.  That takes some shine off of a game that is otherwise a lot of fun.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Puzzle games can be hard, and the timed aspect of this game makes it frustrating for me.  Ricochet Robot and Galaxy Trucker have better timer rules -- someone starts the timer when they are done, so at least it's not an absolute cutoff but one that is relative to your group.  The game strongly favours those with quick spatial arrangement skills, which is not me.

The rules about moving your pawn a certain number spaces to a row to take gems seems contrived and difficult to police, given the race nature of the game.  Also, the whole "max number of gems in a single colour wins" rule is not my favourite; I much prefer the balanced scoring rules of Euphrates & Tigris or Ingenious.

Recent purchase and admittedly only played one time, but I immediately liked it and enjoyed the game with the kids.  I can't see playing it competitively with kids, I'll give them more time and let them pick jewels no matter what. It plays very quickly, isn't hard to learn at all.  Scoring is easy and although others don't like the scoring method, it gives the poorer players a chance.  If you are good at spatial puzzles, you can win, but the other players will still give you a run for your money because they can still score if they didn't solve the puzzle first.*****Many plays later, this game is still a hit.  My kids friends play it  too, one even asked for it for Christmas from her parents.  Great game all around.

Fun race game to complete your puzzle first.We play a little different from the rules as we let the timer run out before anyone moves their playing piece and collects their gems.This seems to add a little more strategy to the game as you can look around a bit and see what gems you want to get and what row you should be in.Also avoids gems and pieces from flying all over the place as multiple people are not trying to move their piece and grab gems at the same time which could be a mess.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2010)

Ubongo is good real time game. It was the first “puzzle” game I ever played and (at the time) it was unique for me so I really liked it. It stills continue to be novel in my book :thumbsup:.  

Ubongo is a hard game for me (a plus for me, besides I´m getting better at it), with a simple set of rules, great components and a (relatively) short play time. It is a complete success with my non gamers friends and my family, so I will buy it soon.

I don´t have any negative thing to say about Ubongo, but if I was pressured to say something, I would say that PERHAPS I don’t really like the scoring system. Sometimes, I feel it isn’t fair, but as the game is so fun and plays so quickly I don’t really mind. 

Ubongo`s spatial abstract aspect is not one of my favorites, thus I´m downgrading its rating to a 6.0, a good game that I want to play sporadically if I’m in the right mood but a must have for me.

Current Rating: 6.0

An addicting game!  I love games with a speed element.  Normally I'm not too into puzzles, but these are easy enough to be fun.  Sometimes you just can't get it, but other times it just clicks.  I also like how you must plan and make quick decisions when going for gems after having solved the puzzle.  As with games of this type, experienced players will probably have a very large advantage over others as they gain experience with the puzzle pieces.  That orange one is a pain!  One minor complaint - the color difference between the yellow and brown gems is not noticeable enough.

Very light, fast-paced game of tetris building. It will certainly appeal to people who enjoy puzzles, however, I do not think it has much in terms of replayability. 

The artwork is pretty but it would've been nice to have thicker puzzle pieces (or something easier to manipulate) since its quite difficult to pick up the pieces. Also, the scoring system is pretty poor since it allows the slower players to win more often than not.

The puzzle part is very fun, the gem grab part is a just OK and seems to have been added on to simply add more to the game and possibly even out things a bit for players who are naturally better at these sorts of puzzles.

Overall it's still a fast fun game, it's just that when someone is moving their piece, their hand can get in the way of others moving theirs or even seeing the score track, so you want to make sure that everyone has equal access to the gem track as best as possible.

With the number of boards and variations, this game has incredible replay value and you can adjust different aspects of the game to control length and difficulty which is nice.

NOT RECOMMENDED for those who don't like timed games. However, you can always use a watch instead to set a longer duration if the included sand timer feels to short. There needs to be a cut-off point though, otherwise some people will struggle over a puzzle for too long of a time.

It sort of reminds me of taking an IQ test, 9 times over.  I guess I like that sort of thing.  It's really just a test of spatial reasoning and Tetris puzzle solving at the same time as other players.  I like that the others don't score at all if you complete your puzzle before time runs out and they don't.  I like that there is a difficult side adults can play against children using the easier side. I don't care for the scoring when playing with adults only so we play the non random scoring rules present in the latest versions rulebook. I also think the game would be better if everyone could have the exact same puzzle to solve at the same time. I still can't shake the feeling that some are just inherently easier than others.  It's a nice approachable filler type game that works for a wide variety of audiences.

CRITIQUE OF UBONGO
Ubongo is a Tangram- or Tetris-like game in which each player has to solve a puzzle by fitting some of their pieces together to make a shape. The shapes vary, because there are 36 double-sided boards in the game. And the pieces used vary because there are six combinations (randomly determined by rolling a die) that will be used to make each shape. I can imagine that replayability could suffer if this game were played too often, but we haven't found this to be a problem. I see it as a puzzle-solving game, not a memory game.

I like the components for Ubongo; they're good if not great. The bright colors and African aesthetic go together well, making the game easy to look at. The unique colors and shape of the pawns are a nice touch, as well. The game pieces don't feel generic in the least. The box is well-done, with an insert that holds everything in place when it's on the shelf.

This isn't a game you would bring out for a deep, strategic experience. Ubongo is definitely a family game. The idea is to have the most gems of one color, and you pick up those gems two-at-a-time when you get to move your pawn to one of the rows on the gem board. The only challenge here is, you have to solve your puzzle before your opponents solve theirs in order to get the gems you want. When it comes to collecting gems, it's "first come, first serve." You need to act quickly, because you have to solve your puzzle, move your pawn and collect your gems before the timer runs out. There's no room for analysis paralysis here.

I didn't bring this game to the table for a long time after I owned it, because neither my wife nor my daughter likes time pressure in games. In fact, I almost traded it away, unplayed, but I'm glad I didn't. Because while the timer is used in every round, it doesn't feel like it dominates the other things that are happening. The thing is to solve the puzzle and then grab your gems, and that is what you will be thinking about. The visual puzzle definitely takes precedence, and the timer just sets a reasonable limit. There will be times when a puzzle doesn't "click" for a player, and it isn't solved, but since this happens to everybody it doesn't make the game any less fun.

Speaking of which, the fun in Ubongo comes from two things: solving the puzzles and figuring out which gems you are going to take. The choice of gem color is very important here, and it's possible for someone to realize that halfway through the game they have no chance of winning. But the game is still fun, because each puzzle is its own challenge. Even if you are losing you still feel motivated to do your best on every puzzle, because each one is its own mini-game. I like this aspect very much, especially in a family game.

Ubongo isn't one of those super-exciting games that you will talk about after you are done. It is a relatively short and extremely lightweight game that scratches the puzzle-solving itch as much as the game-playing itch. I might compare it with Set or Iota, but it's more than a card game and the aesthetic really sets it apart, kind of like Tsuro. If you enjoy puzzles, though, it's a stimulating and fun game that I can easily recommend.

If you like puzzle-like games, then give this one a try.  It will draw comparison to Tetris and inevitably, "This can't be done with these pieces!!!" will often be commented.

RATING: 7
Perfect 15 minute game/filler!  Very enjoyable spatial game in which you seek to put together small 3 or 4 piece puzzles in less than a minute.  First person to finish yells "UBONGO!" and is able to move his pawn back and forth up to 3 spaces on the gem path.  Each other person then is able to move 1 less space according to where they finish.  Two gems are picked up from that row.  Whoever ends up with the most gems of one color wins the game.  However, I do wish Kosmos would have used a different color for orange as I find it hard to decipher the differences between the yellow and the orange.

Quite a nice set of puzzles cleverly put together so you will not see the same puzzles over and over.  But the game itself is not much of a game.  How it felt to us was we sit together solving some puzzles, then somebody wins.  The crystals just are too random and the puzzles too often varied between easy or at least straightforward and downright impossible (at least within the time limit).  (The Easy puzzles, with 3 shapes, were all straightforward, but when they are all straightforward, everyone gets a full quota of 18 crystals and it seems that it is even more arbitrary who wins).  I enjoy puzzles but I don't feel the game is needed.  A more pleasing (to me) game that scratches the itch here is Ingenious.

Great little game.  Plays quick and serves as a refreshing change from "thinking" games that are prone to over-analyzing.  Just get that puzzle solved quick and grab some gems.  Be sure you note from the rules that you must move your pawn and grab jewels before the timer runs out too.  When playing we aren't so strict that we deny someone their jewels, but having to grab them fast separates this game even further from "thinkers" which is refreshing to me.  I think I'm going to enjoy this one for a very long time.

Fun game when you need a mental workout but don't want to indulge in high strategy. Sometimes the puzzle clicks instantly, other times you become convinced that there cannot be a solution. And then suddenly you crack it, only to find that you've run out of time. Biggest problem is that with everyone concentrating on their puzzle, no-one is watching the timer to announce when it has run out. Some luck with the gem grabbing for scoring, but usually the player who solves the most puzzles in the quickest time wins out.

I played this mostly 2-player with my daughter, and she insists that we leave the timer in the box!

Un filler de caja grande. Que no te engañe su aspecto de juego complejo. Se juega en menos de 20 minutos. El que tenga al final de 9 rondas el mayor número de gemas de un mismo color, gana la partida. Y para ello, cada ronda se tira 1 dado que indica con qué piezas debes llenar todos los huecos blancos de tu lámina. Tienes 1 minuto para hacerlo. No te olvides de gritar ¡Ubongo! cuando lo consigas porque ayudará a saber quién lo consiguió primero, segundo... esa ronda. Si lo hiciste, recopila 2 gemas de la fila en la que estés del tablero.
Vamos, más simple que el mecanismo de un chupete. Es un juego para toda la familia, divertido, sencillo y muy rápido.

Inconvenientes:
A mi parecer tiene 2 muy grandes. Su PRECIO es muy elevado para ser un juego de relleno. Y lo que es peor, tiene un MÁXIMO DE 4 JUGADORES, algo inconcebible en un juego de estas características.

Spatial puzzle game that's pretty fun.  Each puzzle usually lasts 10-45 seconds or so.  We played with a gem drafting variant rather than the scoreboard.

Ubongo. Possibly the only game where I don't mind saying the name of the game when the rules tell me I have to. I like puzzles, and Ubongo is fun enough, as well as being pretty. I like the built-in handicapping ability. I'm lukewarm on the scoring system, but it is an interesting change of pace to have the scoring take place with time pressure, so I say what the hack, keep it. The board doesn't lie completely flat so it is sometimes tricky to grab the gems, which I [i]do not like[/i].

Strange combination of timed puzzle plus gem-picking sub-game. The puzzles, i.e., placing tetris pieces into a given area, are ok, but I guess that this comes down too much to natural abilities and maybe a bit of training (like Set). Not sure whether the gem sub-game makes the whole thing any better. Maybe an explicit drafting procedure based on puzzle speed would be better.

Players have 1 minute to use four variously shaped tiles to completely fill their board; if they're successful they can choose two gems from a track.  The player with the most gems of a single color wins.

This is a light, quick game, which should be especially loved by those who like competitive speed Tetris.  Given that I'm rather neutral on Tetris (my geometrical arrangement skills are sub-par) and I'm neutral on games that require quick action, I'm rather neutral on this game.  But it's quick enough to be fun even in light of those defects.

Nice puzzle game. Takes fast pattern recognition skills, but the scoring makes the game more interesting - the fastest player doesn't automatically win. That might annoy some, though.

RATING: 9
Colorful, breezy game: pure fun. Our timer, which lasts about 50 seconds, is just about the right length for the four-piece puzzles, but too much time for the three-piecers; using a 30- to 40-second timer would make the smaller puzzles about as challenging as the big ones. We've enjoyed nicknaming the pieces: periscope, utah, elbow, lincoln-log, the dreaded big-Z, etc. Would love to see a five-piece puzzle expansion. Can't see why people are tinkering with the scoring--the gem board works great as is! [32 plays; sold]

Update: for five-piece puzzles, see Ubongo: Das Duell.

RATING: 7
The first game my daughter and I played back-to-back for a week and it never got old. The gems are a bit fiddly, though, and the rule about each person grabbing an extra gem from the bag smacks too much of luck, but I hold a nostalgic fondness for this nevertheless. Plus, I love the Tetris-like mechanic of it. Always a plus in my book. I give it an 8.

EDIT: Having played more games now, I'd rank this down to a 7.

**It challenges the mind, so I give it a 10.

A gorgeous puzzle game where each player must compete against each other and the clock to solve a puzzle board each round.

My wife adores it and I look forward to the 2-player edition coming out in the near future.

Each player gets their own set of tetris shaped pieces and someone flips over the 'puzzle' for the round.  The puzzles are basically a shape that you have to form by using the pieces available to you.

This is a cool idea for a game because I enjoy the puzzles they give you.  The problem I have with it is that you have to be quick and under pressure in order to finish before your opponents.  Love the game, hate the pressure.

Fast puzzle to test your visual skills. Fun for a bit, but of course the same players tend to win every time.

I hate the scoring in this latest version though. Everyone who solves the puzzle gets a _random_ gem from the bag, so the worst player can score just as many points as the best player (3+1 vs 4), and even twice as much as the second player (1+1 vs 4). And this happens frequently. Random point assignment?? The older version involved set collection and further strategy, without the random gem draws.

Very fun.  I like the puzzles.  They can turn off those who aren't good at them though.  And while I am in no danger of memorizing puzzles due to the variety of cards and 6 solutions per card, I think the replay value is only so-so because there's really not much to the game beyond solving the puzzles.  The jewel mechanism is good to keep people involved, but it's not something oozing strategy.

Quick enjoyable gameplay, especially with non-gamers where the Tetris appeal comes to the fore. While it's kind of fun for a while exploring different scoring mechanisms trying to find something that works and adds to the game rather than being an artifical winning condition, it's a shame the game doesn't provide it up front. The puzzle solving element is elegant and enjoyable, and particularly hard ones are soon discarded without generating too much ongoing frustration, but each player is playing in their own little world, providing little sense of esprit d'corps, especially when compared to FITS where you don't get the fun of the time element (which may be a plus if you're real-time averse) but you're all trying to solve the same puzzle in different ways, making it more of a competitive "game" rather than a race to do different puzzles more quickly, which this is.

Puzzle game with a speed element. Not only do you need to solve your puzzle before time runs out, you also need to think about which gems to grab in order to collect the most of a single color. There are two sides to the puzzle boards, and the side that uses 4 pieces is harder than the side that uses 3 pieces (but after you've played the 4-side for awhile, it can be a challenge to switch to the 3-side).

The game is a good puzzle challenge game and I like the competition vs other players.  I also like how each board has variable pieces and two sides for difficulties, so the boards are not stale.

What a blast! Competitive puzzle-solving has never been so fun. The scoring system is weird, but it's not really the point of the game anyway. I suppose the only possible flaw is that some puzzles are significantly easier than others, but since each player solves (or attempts to...) 9 in each game, this will mostly balance out. 

Components-wise, the colored faces have started to peel off a few of my pieces. A very thin layer of Elmer's glue worked wonderfully to reattach them, and didn't cause any warping in the paper.

I enjoyed this game (even though I suck at spacial puzzles) It has several things going for it:

Production is top notch by z man games. Even the insert fits everything. The colours and Art are really nice! Kudos to Zman.

I liked Tetris, and this made me think of Tetris with a timer.

People who like spacial games such as Galaxy trucker or Factory fun would probably enjoy this. My wife would enjoy this game so it might be good as a pick up to play with your significant other.

It plays fast and there is usually going to be a lot of laughter involved. So why not give it a shot.

Last but not least, your non-gamer friends will probably like this. I could see this being a big success as a gateway into getting others into Euro games. You can teach it in 5 minutes and play it in 20. Last but not least, this could easily be played with younger children and adults alike. Two thumbs up.

Another in my personal line of Solitaire Office Puzzle Games. I played a lot of Tetris as a kid, and still have a soft spot for any game featuring polyominoes: Blokus, Patchwork, even the building part of Princes of Florence. Add Ubongo to that. This is another game I may eventually introduce to my children for spatial recognition reasons, but it doesn't really qualify as a competitive game. Roll a die, figure out which set of polyominoes you use on which board, and then flip the timer and try to arrange them in a way that covers the entire play area before you run out of time. That's pretty much it. The opposed version has something about collecting gems in it, but no matter: it's a speed puzzle, and as a solitaire "use your brain for a few minutes" game, it's pleasant. And yes, I do generally have the Tetris music in my head as I play.

RATING: 6
When I first read the rules for this game it seemed like it would divide players into being frustrated or being bored with simplicity.  Actually playing it alleviated those concerns a little.  Where the variance really comes in this game is that the puzzles have a pretty wide variance in degree of difficulty, so luck plays a bigger part than it might seem at first.  This can be good if it helps everyone stay competitive, but if the guy who is best at these spatial puzzles also happens to get all the easy ones, the fun can get drained out.

I hate this game. I am unable to play it well.

I especially don't like games in which the only person to blame for your loss is yourself. This game exacerbates this. Instead of being semi-disappointed about getting a middling score, you either figure out the puzzle or FAIL.

However, I appreciate the game for what it is, a basic puzzle solving game with an additional gem collecting layer to speed things up and make it feel like a game.

Ubongo is really fun.  I am someone who prefers less direct conflict, and Ubongo does have a lot of indirect conflict.  Basically each player is racing against the clock, while racing against each other to solve a puzzle.  I love racing against the clock because there is so much tension.

Ubongo also plays quickly, and I do enjoy games that play quickly.

Good puzzle game.  Best when playing with kids.

If you solve the puzzle, your blink draw a crystal from a bag (so some luck in the draw).  If you finish 1st or 2nd (solving the puzzles is a race), then you get a bonus crystal.  If you fail to solve a puzzle, usually happens once per game, then you get no crystals that round.  Most points wins(each type of crystal is work a different amount of points).

Jogo extremamente simples, cuja mecânica é gira, mas a forma de pontuar me parece muito forçada e nada contextualizada.

Merece um prémio para o jogo com tema mais colado de sempre – Knizia, estás perdoado!!!

Fantastic!  For all you who played w/ tangrams as a kid, this is for you.  The puzzle solving under timed pressure is a great way to get the brain going, and the added mechanic of jewel collecting makes this a game where you don't have to necessarily finish first to get what you need.  This is one of the better games I've played in a long time.

My oldest son loved Ubongo Duel (we bought it for my parents). He liked to gloat when he solved the puzzles way before his competitor.

I like this game because I can compete with him better.

The core of the game is real-time competition at fitting irregular pieces onto an irregularly shaped rectangular grid.  When you get into the zone and are doing well, it's fun and satisfying and an adrenalin rush.  But there are silly intricate scoring rules that break that energy flow.  Better to ignore their scoring system and just give a point to the person who fit their pieces first (we do that by letting them keep their tile while everyone else tosses their tile aside), and rush through all the tiles in rapid fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun, easy, fast and light game that I can pull out with kids or at parties.  Players race to fit a bunch of shapes into an outline on their individual board.

I have ditched the scoring system and made up my own.  First player finished gets X number of points (equal to the number of players) and sets the timer.  Next player finished gets X-1, and so on.  Anyone who doesn't complete before the timer runs out gets 0 points.

This works fine for us; it's easier to teach and set up, and the most fun is in assembling the pieces anyway.

Very active fun game that makes me more nervous than a long-tailed dog in a room full of rocking chairs.  I love the tension and the competition that evolves as you start to here Ubongo called out from accross the table.  My only complaint is that the piece movement and gem grabbing seems too chaotic, and ends up under the same suspicion as Space Dealer when it comes to the acurracy of the scores or game turns.
It seems to me that this part of the game could be set outside the timer.

I have all of the Ubongo! After an evening of playing a massive amount of Ubongo with my wife, each game more fun than the last, I kind of went on a Ubongo craze, buying Ubongo Duel, Ubongo Extreme, and Ubongo 3D. And if you think it was easy to get all of those, you haven't been looking for them lately. They're all either OOP or not released in North America.

My wife always talks about how much she loves Tetris, but strangely FITS falls completely flat for her. I was at a loss, and was taken by surprise at how much she loved Ubongo--duh, with was the speed element of Tetris that she loved! Don't know why I didn't think of that before. SHe didn't remember this until she played Ubongo.

I'm just going to write it a few more times, because it's fun: Ubongo Ubongo Ubongo Ubongo.

This is not a board game. This is a Tetris Clone Puzzle that someone forced into it 2 or 3 "rules" and components to call it a board game. Managed to play one whole game. After 5-6 years in the closet I recently found a way to use it. I have my 2 and 4 year old daughters roll the dice and based on the roll win diamonds. They have 100xtimes the fun I had playing it.

I fell in love with the Ubongo series the first time I played Ubongo Extrem.  I eventually picked up the original when I had the change.  It really is no surprise to me that I do not like this game nearly as much.  It is still a lot of fun, and I am generally more than happy to play.  However, the puzzles really are not all that challenging, even on the hard side.  That is what I really look for in these games. 

That said, the scoring system is vastly superior to the Extrem scoring system.  The choice of gems is really a game in itself.  You have to pay attention to what you have and are after as well as the same for your opponents.  If you are not careful, you can give the game away to someone who does not solve the puzzles nearly as well.  In my mind, this is both good and bad.  Still, it is superior to the random point draw in some of the other games.   [01/08/2011]

Classic puzzle-solving game with a hectic competitive twist. The gem collecting part may be a bit random for competitive players, but the satisfaction comes from being able to complete your puzzle ahead of others (or at least, on time) anyway. The double-sided board is a clever way of upping the difficulty level. Probably not a game to play 3-4 rounds of in a row, but I definitely wouldn't mind if this is played during every gaming session.

Z-Man edition.

Great looking game. Yes, it's a game and not just a spatial puzzle. Players are randomly given puzzle boards and 12 tetri-style tiles. A die is rolled, the timer is turned over and players try to put the pieces so that they fit in the given space on the puzzle board (each board is different). They yell out UBONGO! when the puzzle is completed and get to move their meeple along a column to collect two gems. The winner is the one with the most gems of a single colour. 

Action is frantic and the board is double sided with the more advanced game on the back. Heaps of fun and really replayable. I wish that there would be an expansion with more puzzle boards and support for up to six players. This is a good party game.

It feels a bit like a kid's game, and I guess it could be a good one as there seems to be a simpler variation that uses one fewer pieces for kids. However, it should work well with adults too.  Players use Blokus or Tetris pieces to complete a puzzle in a limited amount of time.  I think the game MIGHT be better if players attempted to complete duplicate puzzles.  The game is tougher than it looks because the amount of time is quite limiting.  The advantage to this game is that the entire game can be played in about 10 to 20 minutes.  I wonder if the game has limited replayablity.  Players who like quick games and puzzles should like this one.

This is an addictive light filler.  We play on the larger sized board.  I think that there is a high amount of luck here in where you happen to place the first tile as it will usually cause the rest of the puzzle to fall into place or to waste time, but who cares.  I'm not usually into real time puzzle games, but this somehow stays fresh enough 'til the end to keep the excitement alive.

Play without the silly scoreboard and just use the gem drafting variant.

Ubongo is great.  I just played this at BGG.con 2005, and I loved it.  It's a great filler game (although in a big game box) that plays from start to finish in ~15 minutes or less.  When the die is rolled, there is a scramble to get the pieces to fill the figure, and work the puzzle.  I had a great time with it.. I only wish there was yet another set of puzzles that were more complex, because the three-piece puzzles are easy enough that everyone gets them virtually every round, and the four-piece puzzles are slightly harder, but still easy enough to get.  But then again, I don't think the intent of the game is to prevent anyone from solving the puzzle, but rather to reward the person who can solve it the fastest.

Real-time abstract where you're trying to solve a puzzle.  It's a decent filler, and it appeals to the Tetris fan in me, but I could see this getting old if we played it all the time.  It's nice for some quick fun between heavier games.

RATING: 8
Very quick and lots of fun.  I thought that the gem collection element would feel tacked-on, but it does add an important interactive/strategic dimension to what would otherwise be a simple race to complete tangram-like puzzles. 

Time pressure seems just about perfect -- challenging but not demoralizing -- and handicapping is easy.  Some concern about replay value over time, but that's mostly because it's been such an immediate hit that it's getting an extraordinary amount of play. 

Updated to add that replayability hasn't been an issue.

It's a race to solve a spatial puzzle: each player gets a board. Roll a die and flip the timer. Before the timer runs out, you need to figure out which of the several possible puzzles on the board you are solving and grab the appropriate puzzle pieces (each puzzle uses a different combination). Then manage to fit all the pieces into the box, and call "Ubongo!". Depending on how quick you were, you can move your pawn 3, 2, 1 or 0 spaces left/right on the gem board, and grab the first 2 gems in that row. ALL that needs to be done before time runs out. Game ends when you've used all the player boards. Scoring is by sets of gems collected (sets of the same color) - whoever has the largest set wins; ties are resolved by checking each player's next-largest set.

I don't enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles, but this game is still fun - it's fast, and you start to get a feel for how to solve these things after a few rounds. It's also nice that you can easily play with kids, too: the puzzles are 2-sided ... just use the easier side for the kids, or don't use a timer. I do deduct a 0.5 points, though, for the fiddliness of the score mini-game: I don't think it adds much value, and probably prefer the simplicity of the later Ubongo games.

The first game I ever owned.

The style of the game... a puzzle! You get to solve puzzles and if you're fast, you're going to win! I mean what else could be there than that? I just love these puzzle style games and I wasn't able to find many when I bought it like 8 years ago. But it was just awesome. I love these creational games. The only thing I found out that bothered me was getting those crystals. Although those crystals look just awesome and I love the game has them, the quick taking gems during the gameplay was like a distraction for me.

The more I played it, the more times I found out playing without getting those crystals, just competing with my friends who will be fastest to make the puzzle. Great fun. And don't get me wrong, I don't mind competing sometimes with those crystals, it adds some strategy in getting them, but sometimes you just play slower so that you get what you need. Not really great concept, but overall, I really like this game.

Would be fun to find some similar game that has such great puzzle elements to it. So far I mostly replaced this experience with cooperative board games.

And after playing a lot (and I mean a lot, like 15x a week) it may get a bit repetitive, because you know most of the boards, but that was expected. I just played it too much :) Still one of my favourite games.

I'm the worst with spatial relations but I still like Ubongo quite a bit, plus it's one of those games that mesh well with different groups such as serious/casuals and children/adults. Plays lightning fast due to the timer.  A gem of a game.

RATING: 4
This is a fine enough game for what it is.  The mechanic of completing a "fit the pieces together" puzzle is somewhat original but the solitaire game play (except where you compete for rows of gems) makes it a boring experience and I'm not someone who likes abstract puzzle games to begin with.  Besides, with only a small number of shapes to use for the puzzles anyone who has played a few times will already know the solutions.

Also, the scoring system of competing for rows of different colored gems is one of, if not the stupidest scoring mechanic I've ever seen in a game.

The rules are straightforward, and the tasks (grab pieces, solve puzzle, move piece, grab gems) are relatively easy to accomplish.  But imposing a time limit provides a delicious tension to the experience.  And please play with the board -- it adds a feeding frenzy aspect that forces you to make split-second decisions, which is the charm of this game.

A cross between "Tetris" and "Speed Scrabble" is generally the description I give to this game.  It is very simple to learn, and exciting to play due to the speed element.  If you happen to enjoy, or are particularly good at, spacial orientation puzzles, this will be right up your alley.  Unfortunately some people are much better than others at that sort of thing, which could leave the lesser skilled players at a significant disadvantage.  However, the very clever gem-collecting-for-victory-points system helps to even out the playing field a little bit as does the randomness of the puzzles, some of which will be solved in a few seconds, others which might take several minutes (if the other players are patient enough to let your OCD ass finish it).  And those gems are quite nice, as long as you can tell the yellow ones apart from the orange.  Even though this game comes in a regular-sized game box and takes up as much table space as most other games, it is definitely a light filler, and a fairly fun one at that if you've got the mental energy for some fast-moving puzzles.  Mind you, if I had the time, I would prefer to play the slower, more strategic, 3-D "Pueblo".  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 7/10

If you like doing those little puzzles where you fill in shapes with a variety of smaller shapes, this should tickle your fancy just fine.  Be aware, though, that this is unavoidably a game of skill (like Ricochet Robot or Boggle) and that if you don't have the skill, you can't hope to win.  I found it fun enough to play even though I couldn't hope to win!

[Z-man 2007 edition] {Abstract, gateway; puzzle-solving, simultaneous action, timed-turn; optimal 4p} Ubongo is a good family and school game. It has trivial rules and nice components. It's fun and the competition between players is very enjoyable. Though it involves puzzling solving, it's not very brain-teasing. It does not have strong player interaction; however, players could compete against each other for the gems.

The game experience is quite different for solving 3-piece or 4-piece puzzle. I enjoy either kind similarly.

Veloce! Avvincente! Semplice! Veloce perché i giocatori contemporaneamente tentano di incastrare le tessere nel proprio pannello sfida. Avvincente perché non ci si può fermare nemmeno per esultare. Semplice perché le regole di Ubongo si spiegano in pochi minuti.

Funziona così: ogni giocatore prende un pannello sfida e dodici tessere. Un giocatore lancia il dado e capovolge la clessidra. Il simbolo sul dado determina le tessere che si possono utilizzare. Ogni giocatore cerca di riempire il proprio pannello sfida il più velocemente possibile con le tessere che ha a disposizione. Il più svelto urla: “Ubongo” e può spostare la propria pedina sul piano di gioco. Infine, prende due gemme. Per gli altri la sabbia scivola via inesorabile. Devono riuscire a riempire il proprio pannello sfida; altrimenti, non riusciranno ad ottenere nulla. Chi, alla fine della partita, ha più gemme di un colore, vince!

A very simple yet fun speed puzzle game.  Each player has their own puzzle to complete.  The first one done gets to move the farthest on the prize board.  This makes it 2 games in one as you need to be careful what gems you take because you might make things better for your opponents.  

Colorful, easy to teach, and fun.  Ubongo is a great family/starter game.  I'm looking forward to the expansion which will allow 2 more players.

Bought at Dark Tower games in approximately 2008.

A fun family game where players are trying to build a puzzle using a select number of tetris style shaped pieces.  There is a time limit that each player has to finish their puzzle.  Players who finish building their puzzle within the time limit will get to randomly draw a gem from a bag.  Gems are the same as points and come in different colors which are worth different values ranging from 1-4.  Finishing your puzzle first gets you a bonus gem worth 3 points, while second gets you a bonus gem worth 1 point. Not finishing your puzzle within the allotted time gets you no gems.  Player with the most points after 9 rounds is the winner.  There is also a solo variant.

Speed spatial awareness pattern solving with a slightly tacked-on feeling gem collection scoring method. I don't think it'd be better without the scoring, I just think that adds a level of chaos and complexity that isn't really needed. Perhaps just simply taking the gems in the order in which you finish the puzzle would be better somehow... Maybe a pool that you draft from?

Tiny Gems were hard to grab after finishing the puzzles.  Going to grab them usually flung them in different directions and landed them in different holes.  Too much going on in so little time.  I just don't think this game fit my personality very well.  I usually like puzzles too.

I ended up with it cuz the tetris aspect appeals to my wife, and other non-gamers.  I still don't enjoy it all that much, but I enjoy playing games that others enjoy.  So I will live with it.

My game group likes this one, although we have a few people that are not really into spatial relations, and thus the same people win it every time.  It can be frustrating when one person stares at his playfield for the entire time, and then after time runs out and they exclaim "This is impossible!" someone else says "Here, do it this way" and solves it in about 5 seconds.

Great with the right group.  Oh, and also - for us, it's been clearly best with four people.  Not nearly as good for two or three.

RATING: 7.5
This is a quick little puzzle games where you have to arrange shapes (Tetris like) onto a puzzle board faster than the other players. That's it.

Scoring differences aside, if you've played the Extrem version of Ubongo, this one is ridiculously easy. I don't think that being part of the Tetris generation has anything to do with it either, as my 5-year old son can play this and do very well on the easy puzzles. I find the harder puzzles to barely be a challenge. In contrast, the EASY puzzles of Extrem are hard as or harder.

Speedy puzzle game that can last as short or as long as you like.  The scoring mechanism is goofy - but you can take it or leave it since the puzzles are at the heart of the game.  Three- and four-piece puzzles allow some handicapping to even out the competition, if necessary.  Can literally be played for 3 minutes or 3 hours depending on how many puzzles you want to do.

More puzzle than game, Ubongo is a timed race to make a particular shape using certain puzzle pieces.  The "game" part is that the winner gets to take beads from a board and whoever has the most beads of a single color wins.

It's pretty hard to rate this as a game, since there aren't decisions to speak of, and there isn't much skill to it, you usually either see how the pieces fit together pretty quickly or you don't. If you like the basic idea though, and I do, it's certainly a quick, fun, addictive change of pace filler.

Wonderful speed-recognisition game. This one was very fun to play and it doesn't seem to suffer so much about problem player's skill. Normally speed games some player are good and others not. One of the best this kind of games. Gem sharing mechanic is for playing fun, but if for skill game something else must be used.

Timed simultaneous puzzle chaos........family favorite......everyone loves this game.........accesible to all......tetris pieces, fit them into a grid, grab jems when you finish.......great game.......my sister in law, daughter, and sister always talk about Ubongo. Should be in any house with kids, or if you want to pull games out on non-gamers.....very accesible.

I have played 20 games and I can say, that here is something, that old Tetris fans like. But I also understand, this is not a game for everyone. Not everyone likes to turn and twist their brains inside out with those tiles, but I do. Can be little bit stressful, but at least it is quite quick.

Simple mechanics: Fit the given tiles in the area on your board, then grab two jewels.

Yellow side is too simple for me.

Played the last two plays with variant scoring, giving 4-3-2-1 points for solving. Removes the hassle from the scoring and decreases random. Feels better this way.

I like the puzzle aspect of the game, but I should add that I used Joe Huber's variant for picking gems.  The real-time grabbing of gems off of columns and rows is a bit too convoluted for me, and since this is a game I will likely play with family, I prefer a simpler way to pick and choose your gems.  Unfortunately, this is one of those "you either have it or you don't" sort of skill games, and it can suffer if one person in the game isn't as good as the other players.

Very nice components, but my timer is a bit fast (25 seconds), which really puts the pressure on.  One trick pony, really, but a nice trick. Unlike a lot of others here I enjoy the gem collecting; I wouldn't if it were done without time pressure, but the frenzy is fun and often challenging.

The timer should have been electronic, though, as you can't play and watch it, and so the first player may violate the time unknowingly.

One of the earlier additions to my collection.  It is light, but it is fun racing against the clock and other players.  The puzzles can be quite tricky, especially under pressure.  

There is a good bit of strategy in trying to plan which gems to grab and I like that the scoring mechanic makes it fairly easy to catch up and a bit tough for anyone to be a runaway. 

However, if there is  large skill gap you can still run into runaway leader issues. Best if everyone is fairly evenly matched. Or have the novices play the easier boards against the better players using the harder boards.

Overall, a fun game and great for certain people that might not be into other types of games.

Played several times. A nice puzzle game, where players actually have pieces to manipulate while they are thinking (which makes quite a difference to some). Problems have variable difficulties - which should even out over the course of the game, so it does not bother me too much - but overall there are rather easy (even on the difficult side) and not so challenging. Unfortunately, the strange scoring system is completely unrelated to the rest of the game. For these reasons, I have replaced it in my collection by Ubongo - das Duell (the downside being the limitation to 2 players).

RATING: 7
This is quite fun game. There is tension in competing against the time and other players, it is not too difficult and not too easy (at leas for me). 

I am a bit afraid that it will get boring after a while ... we will see.

This is essentially two games in one. One must quickly construct puzzles with the pieces dictated to them (which are basically Tetris pieces with a few extras), and then one must also declare "Ubongo!", move their oddly phallic pawn to capture two gems, and try to get the most gems of one colour by the end of the game in order to win. This SOUNDS easy, but this game is intensely frustrating due to the hugely varying difficulty of the puzzles and the very narrow time constraints. I am an avid jigsaw puzzler, and for the life of me could not solve a vast majority of these puzzles on "hard", but the variance in difficulty was such that it became even more frustrating when I couldn't, because the ones I got, I got almost immediately with little or no real cognitive effort. I enjoy this game, but it makes me want to pull my hair out, as well as the hair of my opponent.

Maneuvering to collect the gems is a moderately interesting framework for the n-ominoes puzzles, which are a fun challenge.  All puzzle-race games are inherently biased toward the players whose minds excel in that area, but this is one of the more inclusive ones, since everyone's puzzle is different.  So, everyone gets to solve their very own puzzle each turn.

RATING: 6
1st Play: The rules read a little dry so I held off buying at Essen. Once the game started it revealed itself as a clever, thoughtful mechanic with quite a bit to consider. Unfortunately the luck of the card draw will decide the winner. I drew nothing but single suit book cards and so won a single category at game end easily but failed to gain a second place anywhere else. As for the spread of symbols I got two with three needed for one point. There was no way I could moderate this. Some engaging mechanics here have been squandered on a luck driven card draw.

Collect resources and turn them in for stuff.  But this feels different and weird.  Excellent game.

Initial Rating. Very dry, bad german translation, bad illustrations of actions -- hard to remind. Crib sheet of icons would help a lot! Terrible colors of resources: Same color and material for money and yellow player workers, grey = food -- grey? Or is grey money and yellow food? It is not mentioned. Terrible designed. Illustration of board is nice, but has no function beside from counting the round.

RATING: 8
Thumbs Up: game of real strategy, with every single point which could be the most important of the whole game. Duration does not increase with the number of players.
Thumbs Down: it's not easy identifying all the game pieces when you open the box. Colours are not well chosen; you risk to mix up the components.

I finally got to try this one and for some reason I thought this would be way heavier than it is, but it's more like an easy family game.

I like the idea and the illustrations, as it looks completely unusual. The gameplay is fine, too, but due to the game being fast and easy, the mechanisms don't get to full use.
You can upgrade your fief to increase you income, cards or workers, which is the most interesting part, but the game runs away too fast.

Anyway, I like everything about the player board, aswell as how you can influence what will net you scores at the end. The game just feels a bit too light and fast to me, but otherwise it's pretty much fine.

My daughter was married in the park this game is based on. Quite an amazing place.

Liked the way actions become cheaper if no one uses them.

Liked the way victory objectives could be increased in value.

Didn't like the theme or rulebook.

This was the sleeper hit of the convention for me and several of my friends. It was also the medium weight hit for me. I had initially had this game in my B-list based on reading the rules, but it turned out to be one of the top games I played!

One of the defining features of Bomarzo is the scoring system. There are 8 deities who are associated with 8 scoring categories. One of the actions in the game allows you to tuck a card under a deity of your choice providing it with 1-5 devotion points. At the end of the game these cards are revealed the devotion points summed and the deities sorted based on the result, this sets the value of their scoring category. The three top gods provide 3VPs for the person with the most in their category, and 2VP for second place (ties are good, all tied players score and the next place is not eliminated). The next two gods provide 2VP for first, 1VP for second. The next two provide 1VP for first only, and the final god gives no points.

[center][ImageID=2597889 medium][/center]

The game is a delicate balance of ensuring you are in a scoring position in some of the categories and finding the time to show your devotion to the appropriate god. Scores are very tight in this game so every point is hugely important. 

A lot of this tension is realized in hand management. Note that cards are double sided, they get played blue side up and can be flipped to their yellow side. Cards can be used for many purposes:
1) Tucking under a god to show your devotion.
2) Playing in front of you to earn points in Science/Culture/Architecture.
3) Flipping over a card in front of you to earn more points in Science/Culture/Architecture but also points in one or more of the card categories Whale/Giant/Elephant (named after the gods that let you play these cards).
4) Flipping over a card in front of you to earn the bonus ability/income listed.
5) There are icons on the blue side which are not present on the yellow side. You earn 1/2/4 VPs for having 3/4/5 different icons showing at the end of the game. 
6) Each card can be discarded when you need to pay a food or a coin, so they are a type of wild resource.

That's a lot of stuff to consider for each card in your hand! There are also a lot of interesting decisions in the action phase, but at this point I'm on the verge of writing a full review so I'll leave that discussion for another time. I will note that at first the rules seems a bit obtuse, but once you've taken a couple turns it all melts away and the crazy genius is revealed. Actions are tight, other player's actions and desires weigh heavily on you, and the end-game reveal of devotion points is exciting. An excellent game.

To top it off, the deities in the game are based on real statues, you can't make this stuff up.

Unique in every way - but great euro - WAY underrated. The scoring is slim pickings so maximize what you have and don't worry about some selective overspending.  VERY relevant is the reorganization of the cards before scoring! Can be a nervy finish.

This game has some potential. Not a simple worker placement, you can modify the board by secretly changing the order of the deities and therefore the endgame prizes for the majorities. A very smart mechanism allows you to copy some other player's action without using any worker or to block the god cards preventing other players to use'em later on the same turn. You cannot figure out who's winning until the very end of the game, even with two players.
I guess the game would be even more tense with 3 or 4, because with 2 people there is some interaction but it's not a struggle for supremacy and you cannot appreciate the twists that the game offers to block the others or prevent them to do what they need.
That being said, Bomarzo has something that makes the game less enjoyable than one would think just reading the rules. Firt of all, the rules themselves: they're confusing and unnecessarly crooked. The game isn't hard to master but eventually it becomes frustrating to search the rulebook for basic infos that are put together confunsingly. 
The artwork is beautiful, but the icons on the cards are far from being intuitive and you'll need some games to manage all the symbols in the game without checking the rulebook.
Game materials are quite poor and once set, the table doesn't look charming at all, expecially compared to other similar games. That's a pity, because as already said, the artwork is very fine. 
In clonclusion, this game could have been a really masterpiece but due to some production issues (i.e: bad rulebook, icons and poor game materials) the gaming experience is fairly less enjoyable than it could be.

Really excited for there to be a game that features my favorite park in Italy!

Despite what the game blurb says, the origins and purpose of the park are well-known.  It was commissioned by a rich noble to honor his dead wife.  It might seem odd to build grotesque statues to honor a loved one, but all the statues depict renaissance religious/mythological symbology (mostly about death and the afterlife).

For instance, the signature sculpture (depicted on the cover of this game) contains a reference to Dante inscribed on it:  "Abandon all reason" (which is completed by "all you here enter", in the architect's notes).  This is a reference to Dante's depiction of hell which has a similar quote, except that it is hope rather than reason that is abandoned at Dante's mouth of hell.

The game play is decent, though it could have used some streamlining and some fine tuning of the components.  All in all, one of our better Kickstarter game purchases.

The first few plays were fun, but after that it started to fall flat.  It seemed like getting an extra worker on the first turn was always the way to go.  I feel it would have been better if the extra goods/powers were on side one of the cards instead of side two.  When playing with four players, the fourth player seems to be at a distinct disadvantage.  The game is fairly balanced with three players.  It works ok with two, but, as usual, It is not as good as a dedicated two-player game.

Worker-placement, very light-civ, with some engine building. The interesting mechanic of the game is the end-game scoring that is created in-game, by players assigning weights to the scoring opportunities.

This was a lot more fun then I expected it to be. Turns are quick and with only a limited number of actions each turn, you really have to focus on only a few things you want to realise during the game.

Interesting ideas in this game. Worker placement and pending win conditions based on what players end up doing in game play. I was really enjoying the game play but the end scoring really altered that to be mixed reviews. I definitely want to play it again to really see now that I know. For now I like it but with potential for lower or higher rating based on my next game. I am 50/50.

Somehow the usual german with conversion of cubes but there is definitely something good here in the mechanics of points.
I like the fact you can't get points from everything but you push with the Dragon the value of the score in which you are in the lead. Quite tense, good duration, compact in time, not overly complicated, nice graphics.

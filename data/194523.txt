This one is absolutely best with three, it seems. A fun take on the prisoner's dilemma that plays surprisingly quick; solid as a 20 minute filler. The special cards add fun wrinkles (like getting to steal all the cards in the offer if you guess what both the other players throw that round). Portable, small box, would make a good bar game. Keeper for the price for sure.

Prisoners dilemma with special abilities and a 3rd option beyond dissent and cooperate. I found the scoring mechanism too contrived and not at all greed-inducing, and the game ended too soon with 4 players, to be able to have a decent case of establishing trust and doing the odd betrayal. Also, the special abilities are not adding anything to the game. Pass.

Saviez-vous que le H.M.S. Terror, de l’expédition Franklin (Cf le jeu NorthWest passage), vient d’être retrouvé dans l’arctique Canadien après 150 ans de recherche ? L'H.M.S Dorolès a 2 points communs avec ce dernier. Un, ce sont tous les deux des H.M.S. (Her Majesty's Ship, donc un bateau de la Royal Navy anglaise. Notez que ça marche avec Submarine). Deux, ils ont coulé tous les deux. Bon, pas dans les mêmes circonstances. OK. Le H.M.S. Dolorès avait plutôt plein de trésors à son bord. Et, brigands que vous êtes, vous pourriez vous jeter les un sur les autres et vous affronter à coup de sabres. Non, vous allez plutôt le faire au style "Pierre Feuille Ciseaux". Ça a tellement plus de classe !

Bruno Faidutti and Eric M.Lang design a game together? Wow, almost a supergroup. The result is a very simple but strangely effective variant on rock, paper scissors within the decision space of the prisoner’s dilemma.

You are collecting sets. Each round 4 cards are available for two people to negotiate over. Who gets what is determined by the result of a rock, paper, scissors action. There is no compulsion to do as you promised.

It plays fast, and best with three (as only two people are involved in each round, so with 4 it could become filled with down-time).

The downside is the box. It might be reasonably small but it could have been so much smaller as all there is inside is a small stack of cards. 

So there it is. Two mega-designers produce a startlingly simple set-collecting negotiation game with the opportunity for back-stabbing. And that is it. No more, no less.

Simple and quick negotiation game about sharing shipwreck loot, rock paper scissors style but with prisoner's dilemma implemented and interesting scoring system where players only score the goods they most and least.

This game plays nearly exactly the same like the game Daxu. Which is good because that is a fun game. This one uses a rock-paper-scissors mechanism instead of using cards.

It plays a bit faster and the art is very good looking. The scoring is interesting and really makes the game. Good for a fast filler.

Quick reactions...I thought more of the cards that modify the basic choices would be better. As it stands the game seems to play out before they are terribly relevant. Also, the importance of scoring conditions would seem to add depth to the negotiations but the luck of the draw along with how quick the game flows reduced this for me. Note that this is for my first play. I definitely like the core mechanic and execution. I felt a marked difference in how I engaged one player vs another in a four player game...I felt powerful in one case and powerless in the other. I also found it strange that the turn order is fixed resulting in some people who never negotiate with others in a 4 player game. Will continue to explore this pure prisoners dilemma game and share more feedback.

Novel scoring and enough complexity to make Prisoner's Dilemma interesting and blur away most of the grudges. The core mechanic works well within its theme, and only creaks a little bit for the double-first-pick results.

RATING: 8
After 1 4 player game and 3 2 player games, I can safely say that this is a devilish game filled with a lot of fun. You gotta lie to get the fun out of it, though, so be prepared for backstabbing and betrayals. Examine the possibilities to get an idea of what your opponent really wants out of it, then anticipate their move. The double first pick gambit is essential, too.

It's basically the prisoner's dilemma but better. You get a pile of treasure and score your highest value and lowest value colors of treasure. Each round, four cards are flipped up, and you and your neighbor decide Share, Steal, or First Pick. Share/Share= each take your half, Share/Steal= Steal gets everything, Steal/Steal= Nothing, First/Share= First gets one of their choice, share gets their half, First/Steal= first gets one of their pick and steal gets the rest, First=First= the piles go away AND both lose one of their colors of loot.

I have mixed feelings about this. I didn't like that pairs got uneven turns for divying up the piles (Elaur/Chelsea and Elaur/Me went 5 times but Me/Maxie and Maxie/Chelsea wen 6). I also didn't like that Chelsea and I never got to play. I think I'd like this a lot more with 3 people because then I could impact everyone. I do want to play it again at some point and maybe house rule even turns.

RATING: 3
(2/17) 5. Was really excited by a Lang / Fadutti partnership on a light filler and was interested in the paper scissor rock variant.  That said, my first play was definitely lackluster.  Maybe our group was too nice, but it didn't really often seem to be in people's best interests to backstab, which would have added much needed spice to this game.

Traded away at Orc Con '17.

(10/17) Drop to 3.  Some people online have argued this is a better game than I claimed, so maybe I need to try it again.

RATING: 5
Puntos fuertes: Ilustraciones cuidadas para la sencillez del juego. La caja es muy chula, el formato es original, muy transportable.

Puntos débiles: La caja no da a entender claramente de qué va el juego sin abrirlo. A nosotros esto particularmente nos molesta un poco, ya que compras el juego totalmente a ciegas. Si bien es cierto que te pone unas previas de las cartas no explica la mecánica ni nada similar. Es necesaria la implicación de los jugadores para hacerlo divertido. Si te ciñes simplemente a jugarlo sin meterte en el papel de saqueador negociante puede llegar a decepcionarte.




Conclusión: La analogía con el Mercedes nos hace gracia. Es un juego fuera de lo habitual, sencillo de aprender y que te hace pensar. Un piedra-papel-tijera evolucionado. Entretenido. Bien de precio, adecuado para tener entre los fillers. Puede que no para sacarle a todo el mundo. 
Viendo los autores (Bruno Faiduti y Eric M. Lang), quien tenga mucho en consideración los diseñadores de juegos, puede llegar a pensar que se trata de una obra maestra, pero no deja de ser un juego barato (entorno a 15€ en 2016) para jugar entretiempos.

RATING: 1
This is a backstabbing negotiation game, where each turn 4 cards get flipped. Players then can talk to each other about how they will pose their hands with the idea that different poses, revealed simultaneously will divvy up the cards in different ways. The general idea is that each player is given the option to betray the deal and take everything for themselves, unless both players betray and then neither gets anything, or even worse, both players can lose cards they've already banked. The game is basic, and it's funny to see people crushed by betrayal, but the game just isn't very fun. This is a big pass for me.

HMS Dolores aka 'Prisoners Dilemma: the game' has got a nice twist on set-collection I haven't seen before - you only score your largest and smallest sets, but if either is tied, all your tied sets score. The important implication of that is that taking cards can hurt you as well as helping (as in Coloretto) which in turn drives the bluffing/negotiation side of the game. Pretty neat.

Dec 2016: The prisoner's dilemma but much less chaotic -- and playable as a game. Because the set collection scoring is quite strict, in some cases it is easy to guess what your opponent will do. Fortunately, special action cards add back the chaos and some variety of play.

Downtime can be atrocious as only two players are ever involved in a negotiation (and hence the limited 3-4 player range). However, the game encourages those not involved to kibitz during negotiations, which provides ample opportunities for one of the best kinds of trash talk: bad advice! 

Like many ultra light set collection games, there's not much there for long term strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Dolores is a clever little blend of set collection and negotiation.
Initially I thought it would be rather shallow - just another entry in the style of Dead Last or Coup with constant irreverent bickering - but no... Dolores actually offers something a bit more thoughtful and constructive than that.

Where many pure negotiation type games quickly devolve into a chaotic storm of knives and bleeding backs, the set collection element of Dolores gives each round a tactful focus.  
Dolores is not a zero sum game, and often both players in each round can find ways to work together to their mutual success.

Eh... I prefer negotiation / bluffing games with hidden elements and more going on. This feels too much like rock-paper-scissors and is overly complex for scoring that it is hard to figure out what to do half the time. Should be a quick light game but it is too hard to grasp what you should easily do to win that it makes it frustrating.

French review of Dolores on Vin d'jeu: http://www.vindjeu.eu/2016/10/01/dolores/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is basically Prisoner's Dilemma, the game.  Choosing 2 players at a time, 4 cards are dealt between them and they each simultaneously choose one of three results.  Depending on the choices, the cards can be split in different ways, both players get nothing, or both players get nothing AND lose other things they've collected.  

Scoring is kind of interesting.  There are several different suits, and you only score points from the suit you have the most in and the suit you have the least in.  But if you have a tie for most/least, you could each suit.  So, it's less about accumulating many suits and more about making your totals even across as many suits as possible.

I had a good time playing.  It's great when the players agree to cooperate, but then one of the players stabs the other one in the back.  It's priceless when the same guy falls for it 3 times in a row.

To quote Quinns, you'll hate each other for five minutes, then love each other for five minutes, then hate someone else for one minute... it's a microcosm of betrayal.

Thus far it seems to work fine and a low player count negotiation game is rare, but it seems a bit...off. Every player needs to be equally into the negotiation, and one person who just isn't interested in talking can severely hamper the turns they're involved in. It's bizarre.

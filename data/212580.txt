RATING: 5
Mega Man Pixel Tactics is a game with a lot of fun and exciting ideas...that it rarely executes correctly.

--Generic stuff about ALL Mega Man Pixel Tactics:

Component quality is very awful. If you don't plan on sleeving these, don't even buy the game. The cards are core-less and flimsy, with the feel of them only being describable as "nails on a chalkboard". Even sleeved, they are still obviously flimsy and there's no easy way to ever make this feel like a professional product.

The non-competitive rules (the ones you actually get in the box) are pretty awful, as they make Leader selection somewhat random. In the competitive rules, you choose leaders for a separate stack. However, this doesn't work with only one core play set, as you need at least 4 additional cards per person.

The action economy system feels incredibly choked. Despite the fact that you get 6 actions per turn, they're split into 2-action phases, and you have to spend them on EVERY game mechanic: drawing, playing dudes, clearing the dead dudes off your board, activating spells/actions on board, and playing effects from hand. Which, yes, means actions can be used to GET cards and USE cards. Historically speaking, that type of system fosters terrible balance and gameplay.

--Stuff about THIS version of Mega Man Pixel Tactics:
Compared to Proto and Bass, there's not much fun in the Mega version. Sure, several of the cards are necessary for fully-competitive decks, but many of them have bog-standard "gamey" effects and the balance is all over the place.

Dr. Wiley Leader will create insane amounts of salt, especially if both players are new. Mirror-match Wiley is just an instant slog that removes all the fun from the game and makes it take ages to set up, since both players have to carefully consider every placement relative to all 8 of their opponents'

There aren't any Operations or Traps that I can remember, which are some of the only fun cards in Pixel Tactics.

--Summary:
If you're going to play casually, I suggest not bothering with this version. If you're going to play competitively, I'm not sure why you're reading an "average" review.

Pixel Tactics seems to have a lot of potential, but hasn't made this game appealing to play in over 8 sets now. To really enjoy it, I would require alternate rules that change how the action system works. I'd like to say that's impossible and that they balanced the game around it, but it doesn't feel balanced in the first place.

As good as the original one, without traps, but all the mechanics are really good integrated on the characters. Great for retrogamers!

Obviously its Pixel Tactics with a layer of Mega Man love.  The cards do a great job keeping the spirit of the characters.

Backed on KS and I'm not entirely sure why... was never too excited about it.  I will say that this is my entry into Pixel Tactics and it was quite fun!  Short, yet strategic, tactical, thinky, but not too much of any of it.  I think this is a great little 2-person filler.  It would've been nice to have some upgrades to the cards and tokens, maybe a couple of reference cards, but not a huge deal.

RATING: 7
Not bad, when I'm in the mood. Lots of unique cards, each one with 4 different ways to play. That's a lot of rules interactions to keep track of, and turn order is funky. But it's kind of cool nevertheless. I don't see myself ever wanting to expand it.
Rating could settle lower, we'll see.

RATING: 10
Very deep gameplay.  The location of cards really defines how the game flows and renders the replayability of the game very strong as the alternating nature of each character changes how they behave. The gameplay is very streamlined, and can be confusing to the uninitiated but can be overcome readily. Highly recommend this game as a good meaty game for 2 players.

Megaman themed version of Pixel Tactics. All the standard pixel tactics rules are there and not much really changes other than the cards. It felt like this set was very simplistic compared to the the previous pixel tactics sets.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2017)

I really like Pixel Tactics and due to this I bought all the Mega Man sets. I played a couple of Mega Man videogames when I was a kid, but I never liked them very much so the theme is mostly lost on me, however, some friends are crazy about it.

In general, it seems the quality of the components isn’t the same as before, the cards now are of a lower quality. There aren’t any icons on the cards (I think due to legal issues), each deck now comes with 28 cards instead of 25 cards. I heavily dislike that the back of the cards is different from other Pixel Tactics games so mixing them without opaque sleeves is out of the question (I guess this is also due to legal issues). The tokens are smaller than before. It doesn’t have any reference card.

Mega Man Pixel Tactics: Mega Man Blue is the simplest of all of them. The rules are pretty straightforward and the mechanisms are the simplest of the series, there are no operations or traps (although the rulebook hints at traps, but doesn’t explain them correctly). You can play it from 30 to 60 minutes. There is a misprint in this card showing an icon from the second set, not a big issue.	

Gameplay remains interesting, you can use each card in 5 different ways and replayability is very high.

I was going to pledge in the Kickstarter but the price was too high. I bought the retail edition much cheaper.

Bottom line, Mega Man Pixel Tactics: Mega Man Blue continues to be a good game to play.  I continue to like the series of games and I expect to have it among my game collection for a long time. Solid 2 player game. 

Current Rating. 7.0

It's another pixel tactics implementation, which is great if you like those. Each card in the deck features a different megaman character or boss and has abilities that correspond, which is really cool.

after a video review: Could be interesting, but I think I really need to play the game to know.

One of the complex and confusing element of the game could be the amount of abilities that various according to the positions of the cards. Now only knowing your abilities but also the abilities of your opponent.

A fantastic 2-6 player tactical card game that uses the Pixel Tactics rules, but with new characters from the Mega Man games! 

My only criticism is that it can have a fairly steep learning-curve, not due to the rules or mechanics, but due to so many different cards that are all unique!

It's pixel tactics, but with Megaman characters. What more could be said? If you enjoy Pixel Tactics you'll enjoy it just the same. All the abilities are new.

The minor downside is the punch sheet of tokens, those are incredibly tiny.

As a big fan of Pixel Tactics, finally landing a retro license feels like this game system has come home at last. Then again, it loses some of the iconography and more complex interactions of the deluxe set, which means I'm not quite as excited as I might have been otherwise.

So, as an old school Mega Man player I looked at the demo of this set. It started promising, being pumped up as a card based Final Fantasy Tactics. However, my old eyes have trouble with the tiny font on these cards. I'd love to play this game with my kid, but tiny fonts are a game breaker.

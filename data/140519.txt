KS backer, with high hopes for a game that would allow me to play an RP style dungeon-crawl game where I didn't have to have a GM running the campaign. From that account, this game delivers. I can choose to play adventures until I die or want to stop. And I can choose to carry on the "Myth", or character story, as I wish. Or, I can start fresh each time. The expandability and customizability of the game is attractive.

I would rank it higher (originally ranked a 9, now I'm droping it to an 8) if it were easier to get through the finer details of the game. I was able to teach and play the game within 10 minutes, and have only stumbled when encountering quests or traps or card text that are confusing or counterintuitive. This detracts from the gameplay as I have to sift through the rule-book for an answer. Which, to be fair, usually results in disappointment, as the rule book is lacking on many fronts.

As a base game, there is a lot here for the value, in my opinion, and I feel I will get many plays through the years. It won't be my favorite game, but will entertain and hit the table more frequently than others.

ok i am basically writing this cause of all the rage comments and very bad ratings regarding this game.how can you rate a game with a 1!!the only reason to do that is to not be interested in that kind of games, which in that case you shouldnt rate at all!
Now as far as it concerns the game,it is true that the rulebook is surely a mess!!i dont think it will be any good for you to read it!so as soon as you buy the game just throw away the rulebook!
All you need to do to understand the game is watch the gameplays by the guys who created this on the net.once you understand the possibilities you have and how the gameplay works you will realise that you have a fantastic game,with very unique heroes,great gameplay,different than anything you have ever played.
Just dont try it right away with your gaming group.like i said watch the gameplays on the net.have fun.

Myth touts itself as a "game engine" where you can make your own stories. After reading the rulebook it was clear the developers were just too lazy to make their own stories up. Never even hit the table.

This is a phenomenal game that is rich in playability.  Yes, the rulebook is very confusing at times.  There are many rules to keep track of, but the game is amazing.  If you have problems with the rules - watch the videos.  We tried this out and had a hard time the first time.  The second time we played after watching the videos we couldn't stop playing to 2:30 in the morning.  Highly addictive for the hardcore fans.

Incredibly arrogant of the publisher to release a CLEARLY unfinished game (and to release so much extra content before a 2.0).  Glad to be rid of it: from the bad art to the dumb box size.

RATING: 7
It's long, it's clunky and it's difficult to learn - but like any good marriage, if you put the effort and commitment in you are rewarded infinitely more than you would be with a smash-and-grab two month love affair. 

I wouldn't personally buy this over Descent or Super Dungeon Explore - but my friend has and I would never begrudge playing it if we had the time to commit.

There's no easy way to say this: the rulebook is appalling. Writing rules is an artform, and this is a lesson in how not to do it. The other components are incredible though.

Unplayable out of the box. In the 90's when internet wasn't there to help out, this game would flop. Heaven knows how many people that claim to have played it and enjoyed it, have played it correctly. The game can be played only by watching videos and examples and the unofficial FAQ, all of which the designers claim that have many things wrong. 
Conclusion: 99% of the people playing this game are playing something of their own invention and not the actual game.

This game needs a second edition of sorts to make sense.

The 1 is to counteract the nonsense 10 ratings of the fanboys.

A lot of people are complaining about the rules and the game being "unplayable."  Each is entitled to their opinion. It did take me a while to get rules somewhat down, and get the flow of the game, and yes I have used the FAQ here to look up 2 things.     However after 4 solo plays this has become an almost nightly game for me.  The way the cards for each hero interact, and how each hero plays different.. the cycle interrupts..  it fits and plays very well.  Add in questing and self balancing in terms of difficulty and it is a keeper for me.

Ok...  I know there's a lot of negative buzz going on about this game.  When I first heard of MYTH, I KNEW it sounded like the kind of game I'd DEFINITELY want to own.  But... as a somewhat seasoned gamer, I've learned to not do impulse buys on games.  Instead I wait to see what the different reviews say here on BGG as well as other online game review sources.  And boy did the reviews come in! Negative review after negative review claiming that the game was incomplete and unplayable out of the box.  People were claiming that even after they felt they had an understanding of the rules, once they set the game up, they were at a loss as to what to do "next".  My urge to purchase this game plummeted like a rock!  ESPECIALLY for one with such a high MSRP.

So... I waited... but a part of me continued to lust after this game.

Then, I caught Remi B's videos for MYTH on YouTube.  His review and breakdown of the game, though lengthy, was very concise and unbiased.  And... the game seemed like it was relatively intuitive (not to mention fun as hell).  

Hmm... ok... maybe I WOULD buy it after all.  But $90 is quite a chunk of change to spend on a game that had so much that was supposedly "broken".  So... with great luck and timing, I grabbed a copy on E-bay for $41.  And boy, am I ever glad I did!

It's true.  I DID download a LOT of supplemental material from the website as well as some helpful downloads here on BGG to help facilitate my own understanding of the game.  Mostly because in my gaming group, I'm the guy that always buys and explains the games for the group I game with.  So, if I was going to have to teach it, I wanted to make sure I understood it as well as I could to avoid any possible pitfalls for the first run-through. Plus, I know there are a lot of other games out there besides MYTH that have downloadable content that makes the game easier to play/learn.

The result?  A nearly flawless execution of our first play-through with very little rules referencing.  And the fun-factor?  Well... EVERY person in my group agreed that it was one of the best, most enjoyable and unique games we've ever played together.  We only played a chapter quest to "get our feet wet", but everyone is stoked to start a story quest on our next game night so we can start "advancing" our characters.  In fact, all the people in my group are also my co-workers, and on the 1st day back to work, we were all talking about the game, and different tactics we needed to implement the next time we play.

So... without regurgitating all that has already been said about the pros and cons of this game, I'll give a short run through of my own impressions.

PROS:
1) Truly unique game, and not just another "dungeon crawler", even though on the surface that's what it appears to be.

2) Amazing combination of a board-game, tactical miniatures game, card game, and rpg elements.  

3) No two games will play the same, lots of re-playablity.

4) Tons of group strategy.  Players have to work together to win.

5) Completely co-op.  No GM or "Overlord" player needed.

6) Totally free-form combat.  No "turn sequence".  At least in the traditional sense.  Makes the game feel really organic.

CONS:
1) The rule-book IS a bit of a mess, but not as bad as some have made it.  More than anything, it needs reorganization, and perhaps some turn charts or reference sheets to aid the flow of gameplay

2) Only two monster groups... not a BIG deal, but a little more variety would have been nice.

3) Definitely a bit difficult to learn (but nowhere NEAR impossible as some have made it seem).


Final impression:
As at least one other reviewer has already stated, those with a background in tactical miniatures, or rpg's will probably have an easier time grasping this game than the traditional board gamer.  In fact... it reminds me of when I started playing D&D WAY BACK in the early 80's.  Then, like today, very few people just went out and bought the rules and started playing D&D (or any other rpg) right away.  For most of us, we were introduced to it and taught how to play by people who were already into the game.  Have you SEEN those rule-books?  They're insane!  A lot to digest.  This game is a similar beast, but WAY easier to learn on your own than D&D EVER was.  BOTH, though, are SUPER easy to teach once you have a grasp of the rules.  So, I'd say to expect that going in.

Another thought is all the bashing on the game straight out of the box.  Yes... you probably DO need to download some additional material, or research the offical FAQ's on the company's website, or even check their forums for answers.  But... doesn't just about every game out there have an errata or FAQ these days?  Some people just understand some game concepts better than others.  This game is DEFINITELY my kind of game, and putting in the extra work to figure it out was worth my time, because I knew this was the kind of game I wanted to play.  But... there are other more popular and higher rated games out there that frustrate the hell out of me due to their complexity, and need to always reference the rules (Arkham Horror comes to mind... I HATE that game).

So... I'll end with this.  If you love a good dungeon crawler with lots of hack-and-slash, tons of replayability, the option to advance your characters over the long haul, unique card and dice mechanics, co-op, miniatures, strategy, and oodles of fun... this game is definitely for you.  Do you need to do a little extra home-work to learn it?  Possibly.  Is it worth it?  In my opinion... DEFINITELY!

As of now I really felt like I got burned on this one. I can see the potential of the game, but the rule book is a mess. I really wanted this game to be a Decent w/o overlord but it is a fantasy Zombicide, cool ideas but not a really fun game.

RATING: 8
The rules really are bad.  I attempted to learn the rules twice, and by the time I felt comfortable enough to play it,I was quite annoyed.  

Now, however, it is one of my favorite adventure games.  I really like the combat system involving the cards.  It is a blast to play the different characters as all feel very different.  The game feels much more strategic than other games using a more rudimentary compact dice system, such as Mice and Mystics (which game I also enjoy for different reasons).   The leveling up aspect of Myth is rewarding and makes the game addicting.  It is beautiful to look at.  However, the game is very ambiguous, and I feel it can only be enjoyed by groups that are willing to pick a rule interpretation and go with it.  When I am playing, and a situation comes one about ambiguity with a card text or a rule, I do not look it up for the most part.  I have found that most of the time, the rule is not in the rule book, and I have no desire to look it up online.  Finding the “right way to play” would suck the fun out of the game.   What I am saying has been said before. In my opinion, the game is broken and can only be fixed (or can only provide a good gaming experience) if the player is willing to get into the loose spirit of the game, worrying more about having fun and less about getting things right (as I feel it is no fun to even attempt to get everything right in this game).    

This said, now having a grasp (for the most part) of how to play the game, it is one of my more favorite games to play.

Took a little more effort then I would have liked to learn the game, but after the initial 2 night learning session, the game ends up being pretty streamlined and really fun to play with a group. The components are very high quality but I would like to see more of them to get some really epic games going. I would rate the game higher but there are some holes in the rules that need to get ironed out in a new print run, but after that I can see this potentially being my favorite game to date.

**EDIT**

After receiving my full kickstarter package, and an update to the rules, and being able to get in more plays, Ive upgraded the game to a 9 in my rating because its much more enjoyable.

After 75 hours of playtime, 30 of which was last weekend, the only thing im thinking of is playing more Myth. The more ive played it the more fun it is. Im upgrading to 9.5 rating.

Wow, what a game! the learning curve on this one reminds me so much of the transition from D&D to AD&D back in the day.  And that's a good thing. Back then, for a vague rule,our resources were magazines, friends and then an educated guess.  Finally, the Player's Handbook and DM Guide were published.  That's where Myth is - waiting for their equivalent of the DM guide, their second wave Kickstarter rules version 2.0.  Mechanically, this game is a blast.  The coop play is as good as those halcion days of arguing over who gets the potion of extra-healing!   My ten year old and I played it over the weekend and I have verification Myth is a keeper as he is begging me to play again! Well done , Megacon - I cannot wait for the 2nd wave of minis, quests, et al. This rating goes to a ten once 2nd edition rules are in hand.
UPDATE: OK, I fibbed.  I am raising this to a ten before the updated rules are released in the upcoming wave 2 kickstarter delivery.  My son and I are nearly done our first Story Quest and the play is remarkably fun.  Rules are now no problem whatsoever (though I am an RPGer so the occasional educated guess/interpretation of a rule goes hand -in-hand the ole' RAWvRAI)Example of gameplay: we enter 12x12 tile - three fighter surrounded by a hunting pack; a lair has spawned eight crawlers.  My kid's archer Plays his Tumble Card after his regular move; then launches Fool's Errand; distracted crawlers open path for my Acolyte to sprint to lair and smash it with his new Mace (great vs lairs); Soldier plays a few Rage cards; then HArvest of Bones! Booyahh! Our aggressiveness just triggered a darkness cycle! No sweat, my kid has been itching to launch Orion's Tears the next Hero Cycle. Bring it!! For those struggling with the rules, please keep going as this is the best hybrid roleplay/mini game out there!

2016: Original KS edition with 2.0 rules and a BUNCH of extras.

2017: I've really struggled to get Myth to the table but for a while in both Sydney and Melbourne I had a solid gaming group give the game a solid go for months at a time.

Even after three years, I really like Myth. The core mechanic - sharing a turn but managing your own hand, combined with slow-burn deckbuilding - is really great. I especially like the way movement and turn-planning work. It's a rule that makes little sense until you play it (and get the 2.0 cards, the design of which is much better), but it becomes pretty central to the whole game.

There are massive flaws - the rulebook, even in its 2.0 form, is pretty glitchy, and the hit/damage system is occasionally blurry in application - how many attcks am I doing, how many hits? Playing with a mix of 1.0, 2.0 and paste-up content is also really frustrating, espcially as it looks more and more like they won't ever get the chance to fix it up properly, given the probable sale of the property. The chaacters are uneven in impact on the board, the quest cards integrate poorly with modules, and the whole thing smacks of poor testing.

But even with those flaws, if I had a regular group I'd be playing once a fortnight and looking forward to the sessons all fortnight. It's a great way to scratch your RPG and boardgaming itch together, and the aesthetics of the game are quite original, and much much nicer than the competitors (Descent/D&D).

I really wish this had been produced through CMON, and/or that Gloomhaven hadn't distracted the broader boardgaming public from this gem of a dungeoncrawler. Most of the other options are too granular and long-term. Myth's get-straight-to-it design is really welcome in this space.

Kickstarter backers in the UK are lucky - we got the game 9 months after the US (and Retail) and with all (OK, most, or some) of the extras.  We are lucky because a lot of the pain suffered by the trailblazers has been to our Benefit.  There are now alternative rules, videos, updates (patches) and tons of FAQs which iron out most of the wrinkles.

Anyway, for me this game will replace Descent.  The co-op nature of the game (no overseer/GM) and the ability to tailor quests to your needs/time is excellent - it is exactly what I want in a dungeon crawl.  The truly asymmetric play style of each of the characters is brilliant.  Playing as a soldier is completely different to playing as an archer or a skald or an acolyte.

The wait for this game was at times painful, but it was worth it.

Warning : If you do want to play the base game 'out of the box' without referring to external resources or without purchasing some extra minis then this is probably not going to be the game for you.  There are issues that I am not blind to, but there are now plenty of resources to help.

Worst Rulebook. Ever. Pages and pages about minutiae (e.g., how to place monsters when they spawn)and almost nothing on the more important aspects of the game.  After reading the 64 page rulebook, I sat down to play with my son and was shocked to realize: I have no idea how to play this game! Extremely frustrating.

This is absolutely stellar game wrapped in a befuddling rule book.  The issues with the incomplete rulebook and poorly worded cards (including haphazard and inconsistent use of keywords) are real and should be recognized.

If you don't mind spending the time and effort to learn the game via the forums and online resources, you will be rewarded with one of the most unique dungeon crawl Coops in existence.  I'm a huge fan of the gameplay, even if the implementation leaves much to be desired.

Also worth noting that you will likely want to acquire a Captain level pledge, as buying everything retail will be such a money sink and be so incomplete that it's likely not worth your time.

2.0 Version: 7.5
I'm pleased to say that after a year of effort by the community and Megacon games this game has done a 180 for me, the improvements to the rules consistency has taken what was a chore to something simple and intuitive. There are still instances where a rule needs clarified but no more than any other game with a comparable complexity level. 


1.0 Version : 1
Absolutely abysmal experience. Half baked rules that barely work without multiple FAQ's and videos on hand, and when you finally wade through that quagmire you emerge on the other side to find an exceedingly dry, boring, repetitive game. Stay away from this one at all costs (because this one will legitimately cost you).

RATING: 9
After playing 3 games, I'm giving it a cautious 8. Will have final thoughts after I get more games under my belt. So far, it's been enjoyable after a rocky start. Edit: After playing several more games, including a chained chapter quest, have revised my rating upwards :)

Final: Played some more single chapter quests and the 1st Act of a Story Quest. So... yup. Myth is definitely a keeper. The way the whole Darkness AI is managed keeps things unpredictable, and the way the different characters play is very refreshing. "9" is my final rating.

Unimpressed. The card play is basically simplified Mage Knight. The tiles / quests are basically straightforward hack 'n slash. Overall, Myth seems to be a minis collection with a barely-designed and messy rule-set included as an add-on.

i love the ambition of the game design. the production value is top notch. it has a very unique experience of wanting to "dig into it" by learning their set of rules (someone above compared it to transitioning to AD&D. not a bad metaphor). definitely a bit more to grasp and all the literature (FAQ, vidoes, etc) should be read/watched if you don't have a tutor... but feels more fulfilling than other dungeon crawl.

trumps Descent by being a co-op (or solo) MMO/tactics  board game instead of a "war" dice roll off between attack and defense. i also like the game having an AI/threat system instead of an overlord that can tend to troll depending on your group.

very open and autonomous to the group for questing if you choose to play it that way.

each class is very unique. hand management for actions, reactions and interrupts (during Darkness phases) is a nice system.

can't wait to play more and see more developments, expansions

I'm ignoring the problems with the rulebook here - it was terrible, but I spent the effort to learn the rules using it and other resources. 

The gameplay is bland and repetitive, having few meaningful decisions and mainly boiling down to cycling through your hero deck for a few cards to combo and beat down hapless minions. I don't get the storytelling aspect the story quests are supposed to provide.

At the end of the day, the sloppiness of the rules and card text combined with assorted annoyances like insufficient component quantities (the base game does not actually ship with enough minions to fully populate even Wave 2 of a Slaughterfield tile) meant this game went back out the door nearly as fast as it came in.

Wow! This is bad. The game is not developed. It is a spiraling mess of confusion with exceptions and contradictions. It would take an insane amount of time to watch videos, read 2 rule books and read forums to figure this game out. It appears that it wants to be like Warhammer Quest with hand management.It is a fiddly undeveloped bad game. My first play I gave up after 6 hours of reading and watching videos. I regret the money I paid for it.

I could never work up the desire to give this one another try. I stripped it down for spare parts and gave them to some designers to make a different game.

Maybe 10 years from now there will be a MYTH 5th edition. I won't look at this again until it is developed, streamlined and cleaned up considerably. Im glad they have their core fans that love this game.

Like most people who purchased this product I really wanted to like it, and like many folks I ended up loving this game
Is it perfect – no, is it a complex game with almost infinite re-play possibilities – yes.
My gaming group is comprised of middle aged adults who just do not have the time to dedicate to role playing games.
This game is a combination of board game and RPG, which makes it perfect for my gaming group.
We can still feel like we are building our characters over time, but the preparation needed before a gaming session is far less then it would be with an RPG.
It does have limitations with only a handful of character classes and monsters, but the future looks bright for both of these.
If your life is that of immediate satisfaction, maybe you should wait before buying this game.  It is still very much in its development stages, despite the core box going on sale at retail stores.
Within a few months there will be so much content that it will take my casual gaming group months to experience it all.
My gaming group is made up of some pretty diverse folks, some love competition games and others love cooperative games.
This is one of the few games that everyone really enjoys.  It has the personal challenge of individual tactics via player cards and cooperative tactics to complete the adventure.
Overall the product that is available for this game is very well done and is suitable for play out of the box.
If the game can weather the negative press regarding the rules and the companies’ ability to fulfill their pre-orders, I know it will grow to be a solid product with a large group of community support.

RATING: 8
If you consider yourself to only be a board gamer (no CCG's or war games) then read up on this game before buying, or find someone who will demo it to you.

If you are a veteran war gamer looking for something different, you will LOVE this game. Despite what most BBG'ers say about Myth, you will not have problems with this game b/c 99% of the problems people bring up about Myth are things that war gamers expect to deal with any time they play a new game, or new models are released for their favorite game.

Yes, the first print rule book is laid out horribly; 98% of what you need to know is in there, just occasionally hard to find. Everything else you need to know is covered in the official FAQ, which is the 1st thing every war gamer gets after buying a rule book. And like every war game (b/c Myth is a co-op war game, not a board game) there will be edge cases where rules conflict, just deal w/them like you do when playing anything else.

TLDR: If the idea of a cooperative, combat-centric, card driven game set in a fantasy world appeals to you, this is a game you will enjoy.

Pretty much unplayable as I see it. We couldn't find answers to half of our questions without wading through a plethora of different rules rewrites, FAQs and errata.

Minion on KS2

6-23-15: I have been playing the base game for about a month now.  I play with two of my kids (21 and 16) and occasionally my brother.  We have about 20 hours of gameplay in, through several sessions.  I have also had some time to paint minis, which is also enjoyable.
As a young teen, I was able to play some pen and paper AD&D and have had a bug ever since.  This game fills a BIG itch for that.  I love the open ended nature of the rules and no need for a DM/Overseer.  It strikes a great balance.  It was a bit daunting at the beginning, but once we played through a bit, using the 2.0 rules from Megacon website, (and lots of forum posts on BGG) we feel like we are doing well.  You have to be able to use your imagination.  Some people don't like that freeflow scenario, but it works so well.
We have used cards others have produced, and even bought some 2" skeleton figures from Amazon and made up our own Captains.  Super fun and flexible.  If we try something and it isn't working, we just roll it back.  We have fun because we adjust it on the fly.  The design is flexible and we go with it.
Because we can print the revised cards, we have had play sessions with two soldiers.  I use this method to teach new players.  The soldier is easier to understand and has some fun mechanics, so why not have a couple in a party!
I look forward to the Journeyman KS release next year, but anticipate many sessions over the next 12 months while we wait.  Hopefully we will have some new cards/rules to try this Fall.  Either way, the flexibility is terrific.  If you only have an hour to play, through down a tile, put out a couple lairs and a hunting party, grab your favorite character, pull a green and a blue card and have some fun!
We have just started one of the fan-made stories and are tracking our progress.
I hope more people will give this game a shot.  It takes a little effort to get the flow, but I don't see how anyone playing Descent or similar can't see the superiority of this design.  Unless you want to be a DM and not a party member...

La mecánica me encanta y con el manual 2.0 y la ayuda del manual no-oficial (por si te queda alguna duda) por fin se puede disfrutar completamente. El setup es rápido pero una loseta (aún pequeña) se puede ir a más de una hora. Por tanto las misiones de historia se van a 4h fácil. Lo bueno es que tiene otros muchos modos de juego que permiten jugar 1/2 losetas y continuar otro día sin problema. ¿He dicho ya que me encanta? :D
 8.5

------------- Tras 3 partidas más...
Después de tres partidas y haber solucionado varias dudas con las cartas de oscuridad, el juego es muchísimo más rápido. Se explica en 20min y un par de losetas (tamaño pequeño y la otra grande) fue como hora y media. Todo el mundo que lo juega le encanta, sube medio punto más. Estoy deseando jugarrrr!!!

Se ganará el 9.5 cuando el manual 2.0 se finalice y confirme el buen camino empezado.

Bought base game @ retail. The game is great, if you make it your own. I take the rule-book more as guidelines than actual rules. I love the Darkness system. I wanted a no-DM dungeon crawler playable with 2. Dungeons & Dragons is a close second, but Myth's art and system are better. Using cards for your actions is super cool and everything you do is absolutely thematic.

Kickstarted at Captain level. 

I'm horrifed by MCG's attitude to their kickstarter backers. We provided our trust and free working capital; they are supposed to provide us with a game produced to industry standardswithin a reasonably timeframe. They haven't been able to do either.

Their attitude to the rules corrections and errata-rich cards is typical. They've made an absolute mess of them, yet are happy to ask for an expansion purchase to replace them, rather than doing the right thing and replacing them for free to backers.

I think MCG are greedy. They didn't spend the money on a professional rules writer or editor. They didn't have the rules blind tested or proofed. They did, however, spend their time designing and running a second KS campaign, before delivering Myth.

They are also obviously incompetent. The campaign has lurched from one delay to another. Currently, as a European backer, I have no idea whatsoever when MCG will fulfill their obligation and deliver the game to me.

I'll be offloading this sorry wreck of a game as soon as I receive it.

RATING: 7.5
I like this game, thought it has its flaws, cost and availability being two of the biggest issues.  The 2.0 rules are nice, but on more than one occasion I had to turn to the 1.0 rules for clarification. 

It's a sandbox, but it isn't obvious that's the case when you buy it. While the stories included in the 1.0 rules aren't much more than bare outlines, the expanded story quests in the file section will flesh these out for you as well as potentially inspire you to craft your own.  There are also a number of fan-made adventures available.  I'm not sure if I'll actually get around to it, but I do feel more empowered to tinker with this game's rules than any other I've owned.  

Despite my complaining about the price, I intend to keep Myth, and buy more Myth expansions.

Having several plays under my belt at time of this review, I can safely say that this game is as dynamic and inspirational for the creative mind as was advertised in Kickstarter. I cannot comment on the rules because I did not learn them from scratch, and by the time I acquired the game I had most of the concepts and mechanics down from numerous vids and online resources. Gameplay was smooth after a couple playthroughs. I am excited for more content to expand the base set. I would like to see more! I highly recommend this game to any gamer who enjoys crafting the story as much as winning the game.

Updated my score from a 7 to an 8. Played last night and now am getting the hang of it.

Yes, the rules are a bit confusing, but the game is VERY playable unlike what some of the comments indicate. Mercs has stated they are sending out another set of rules in the second wave to the backers. They have owned up to the issue with the rules. The consumer who didn't kick start it will end up never seeing the old rule book. It's a kickstarter and anyone knows that rule books are the hardest part of any game to get right. Zombicide had the same issue and revised their rule book as well. 

DO I think you should buy this game? If you played Descent or like miniature games, this gives you something fresh to play in a very over saturated genre. Myth is a lot of fun and can be customized, how you want to play it. All of the classes feel unique and different. You also have to work as a team more than any other co-op type game I have played in the past. 

For a fairly new company, I really think Mercs is heading in a great direction. I am really happy to have Kickstarted Myth. I can't wait to get all of the stretch goals!!

The shipping version of this has serious problems once you actually start playing. It sounds and looks as good as you'd think when you sit down, but after a few minutes things get kind of rough. Lots of different cards and rules are really poorly written, and some of the concepts fall flat. Take the archer, for instance. Frequently there are situations where you will have plenty of arrows in your handy or even played to the table, but unavailable for shooting. In fact, many times it's easier to get an arrow from your discard pile that you can shoot than from your hand. There's not enough to in the game play to back up the why some turns it's easy to shoot three enemies, and some turns you literally can't engage in combat as an archer if you've recently shuffled your discard pile. That's just one example of maybe 20 issues that were pretty egregious in a single play.

Myth desperately needed another year or two of play testing. The game is unbalanced, entirely too random and swingy in difficulty, and the rule book might as well not exist.

I wish I was kidding about that last part. The rule book is really that bad. Nowhere does it teach you how to START and SETUP the game. There's a "here's how combat works" campaign at the end of the book, but that still doesn't explain enough. There are entire mechanics that exist in the game that are never mentioned once in the book. For example: the starter "here's how combat works" campaign gives players poison status effects, except what poison does is never once mentioned in the rule book. 

The game is a hodgepodge of bad mechanics hastily thrown together until they resembled a dungeon crawler. While the game is gorgeous looking with incredibly high quality components, the actual game itself is frustrating, unfun, and impossible to play unless you already know someone with encyclopedic knowledge of the errata, FAQ, youtube videos (which are nearly all outdated and refer to cards by names that are now different!)

Avoid this game.

Kickstarter Captains Pledge and Spriggan Hero.  Requires download of FAQ.  Watching videos from publisher definitely helps the learning process.  If you like highly thematic games with enough freedom to customize to an extent then I feel it is worth the effort.  Know what you are getting into first, this is no simple dungeon crawl with limited actions and a 20 sided die to decide everything.

What a mess. I think the designers turned me away from the game. Probably a good idea to not insult your customers on an online forum next time.

In order to get treasure you need to kill 3 minions at once or a captain/miniboss/boss. Each hero has a deck of 25 cards where less than half are going to help you with killing 3+ monsters at a time or even doing any damage. You spend half the game cycling cards trying to get cards that will help you out.

Stupid game.

Rule issues aside there is a fantastic and fun game here, if you are willing to invest a bit of time.  This game will only get better with time, as the rule issues and kinks are worked out.

Myth is everywhere.  People are making entire geeklists about this game, where each entry links to Myth.  I go to a gaming club and instead of playing games I'm participating in a 30-minute conversation about Myth. Myth Myth Myth Myth Myth.  What's going on?

I don't want to be the party-pooper here, but the hype around the game is bothering me.  I have no interest in this game, but I feel it's being shoved down my throat.

And the game is only being released in 2014?  What, that's still a year?  Do I have to endure this Myth-hype for the rest of the year???


Now, I realize this text may bother some, particulary those who funded.  I don't really care.  I do care however, about the authors of Myth.  I suppose they're guys like me (with the exception that they're actually making a great game ;) ).  If they feel I'm crossing the line here, I'll gladly edit this.  But I think they should see the fact that someone is "hating" on their project, as an indication that Myth really is loved by many people.

It's a dungeon crawl. I couldn't hold out with so many cool goodies available on the KS.
It took a while, but I finally got off the fence, and backed it at the Captain ($100) level, but declined any extras. I want to try this first, and since only 2 things were KS exclusive outside the base pledge, I figured I could live with myself if I didn't buy them.

Every time I see previews I keep kicking myself in the ass for not pledging higher to grab a bunch of the add-ons....and they're opening the pledge manager again. Looks like I'll be adding a bunch more stuff.....

Expected delivery: Jan. 2014
Delayed until: Sometime 2014?

Box 1 Delivered: Sept. 5, 2014

I love the minis, and the game is 'OK." even with the 2.0 upgrade. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it. It's looking like I'll paint everything, add-in the 2.0 materials, and sell my pledge.

Sold it. 

The lack of any real progression, rules ambiguities, poor keywording, complete lack of play-testing, and generally poor rules writing, even after having a couple years to fix it burned me out. Hell, I'm still waiting for the 2.0 materials from the rest of my KS pledge, and not a word from MGC on when or even if it's coming.

Myth is far too complex and involved for what it's trying to accomplish. While the card-based gameplay was innovative, the lack of progression, and complexity made it impossible to teach, and difficult to play.

I have washed my hands of MGC. Buyer beware.

This game has only one problem: Poorly written rules, not intended.
I had to work a little bit to actually play it, but when it starts to make sense and when you can make educated guesses about what it is lacking, it is the BEST dungeon crawer experience on board games, almost made me feel like i was playing a true tabletop RPG.

The only thing ill wait to see if gets better is the character progression part. They have something planned, it is apparent, but they must do in a way that players can choose which quests they have to complete to be worthy a "level up" so that us players could start adding new cards and keeping new equipments in a different way that it is written nowadays. 

Perhaps they can rank the quests by XP and give each new character skill or equipment have a XP points requirement to actually buy, and they can also create tiers for the cards so that you can buy blue cards if you have X green card.

If they nail this progression in a different fashion that other renowned board games have made in the past, they all really lack and thats the main reason for lack of a deeper experience in the game. It will earn a perfect 10

RATING: 6
A very ambitious project, but the gist of the game does not reach its promise. Keeping track of everything slows down the game and once you know all of your character cards, exitement fades as I feel too limited with that action/reaction restrictions. In the end it is just another dungeon crawler with some rpg elements.
If I had to learn the game by reading the rules by myself, plus fixes, plus errata, plus faq, my rating would surely be lower.

Simply not worth the extra effort required to learn how to play this "game". What they sell you is not a game, more like the concept of a game with lots of bits to try and distract you.

This entire project is the poster child for everything wrong with kickstarter.

I would have never thought I could be more disappointed in a game than I was with Dark Darker Darkest...I was wrong.

The thing that pisses me off the most is the perpetual excuse, "it's a sandbox game". I am certain that when people try and force feed this line of crap to me they actually mean "catbox game" or "litterbox game".

Congratulations MCG, your ineptitude in virtually every single regard has cost you another customer for life.

Better than people give it credit for, it's the only purely co op dungeon crawl with mechanics more complex than move and attack.

That complexity comes at a cost, though, sometimes the rules are a bit obtuse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules are hard to get through on the edge cases, but the core mechanic is pretty awesome.

It's a pure co-op with a lot of optional difficulty sliders, though, so house ruling isn't going to break anything.

One thing I hate HATE hate about most dungeon crawls and the co op like is how repetetive combat is.  Roll the dice, see if you hit, same attack, over and over.  Myth avoids that.  You're building a deck and then dealing with what you draw.  It gives the game a lot more tactical depth, but this occasionally means dead turns.

Classic example of overproduced, yet underdeveloped.  Some good ideas, but needs a lot of work to make it a functional game.  A co-op game that depends on the players to balance it, is simply not balanced at all.  Once you have seen all the cards your character has to offer the gameplay gets very repetitive as the same monsters just continue to spawn.  Even if the rules where ironed out, I'm not convinced it would be any better then Mice and Mystics, which is what clearly inspired it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Very poor rulebook.

What you can do in a round is decided by cards, and it is totally random. Which sucks and makes the story in the game look extremely silly: "Hey! Let's stand and do nothing since we cannot attack because we do not have the right cards!" LMAO

This game is a really really good idea that went really really wrong.

Please, remove the stupid decks of actions and make people do whatever they want with each character having its own three or four abilities. There is too much randomness in this game and you can't do what you want. You should be able to attack once per round all the time with or without cards. It's dumb that you have ennemies all around you, but because randomness was not on your side, you cannot attack and sometimes not even defend yourself... LMAO

The poorly made game manual makes the learning curve go way up when it could have been quite simple. Also, they should remove the stupid decks of actions since it makes no sense.

Stay away from this poorly made game with an even poorer instruction manual. It's not even worth 10$.

The one thing that I don't like is that there is so much stuff from expansions and kickstarter that is really difficult to find. The base retail game still offers a lot of hours of play but to me feels incomplete, knowing just how much content is out there.

Except that with all the videos, reference sheets and manual rewrites out there I didn't find rules an issue. There is also a TON of awesome content to fix / mod the game here on bgg.

Game is absolutely FUNtastic. I have played the d&d adventure system but this takes the DMless coop experience on a whole different level

RATING: 2
Everyone knows about the horrendeous rules, that were essentially written by BGGeeks because Megacon didn't feel th eneed to do anything about this and when they DID and reworked the whole rulebook and all cards, they charge you money for what was meant to be included in the box. This trainwreck, even if it worked as intended, is NOT even a game, it's a set of rules that regulate combat nothing more and nothing less – everything else is up to you to decide. This is not a dungeon crawl, this is an adventure game without the adventures, it's a bunch of components without anything you could actually call rules and without any actual gameplay. You have to decide what room you want to walk into next, what enemy to fight against and how many of them. There is literally zero exploration or surprise. It's by far the worst game I have ever bought and my worst Kickstarter experience ever.

First of all, the rules are as bad as you've heard. I've read hundreds and hundreds (and hundreds) or rulebooks, and these are possibly the second worst I've ever encountered. The cards are also difficult to parse, to boot.
The AP system is interesting, but given the highly-constrained nature of the cardplay it doesn't seem to pan out--since you can keep at most one card per hand, you're simply playing what you have as best you can (which is usually pretty obvious) with no real notion of playing ahead.
Plus, the game suffers from the same problems that many such dungeon crawls do--moving hordes of minis, figuring out the AI, etc. 
Finally, there are a number of niggling theme issues that serve to break integration for me. The inability to keep treasure, the silliness of the starting equipment (fireplace poker?), the lack of serious consequence for loitering, the necessity of proxies...
In sum, a sadly predictable Kickstarter half-baked design.

RATING: 8
Myth is the hack-n-slash aspects of an RPG masquerading as a miniatures board game. My gaming group and I find it a very fun and engaging game and we've barely scratched the surface on all the Chapter, Act, and Story quests included. As well as all of the enemy races. The friend who plays the soldier says he actually feels like a tank. The friend who plays the Trickster always gravitates toward engineer-type characters in everything he does and he is satisfied with the hero. In fact, he always has something to play so I'm not sure of the criticisms of the Trickster. The friend who plays the Apprentice regularly giggles when he plays his offensive spells. I play the Acolyte and love the ability to either heal or do damage.

My main criticism of the game is outside of Free-form questing, the game can get very long. Like, 6 hour session long depending on set up of the Act. This makes it harder to get to the table when we actually want to progress our characters. (Characters don't progress anything but their items and treasure bag outside of Story Quests.)

Without a doubt, the single shittiest rules I have EVER seen in my history of gaming--and I've seen bad rules! The game is totally unplayable out of the box, with numerous references to concepts that they don't bother to fucking explain. Reading these rules makes me want to vomit, from the sheer incompetence and lack of Giving a Shit that they evince. 

Edit: I watched a couple of hours of tutorials and thought I had a handle on things, but it was still hopeless. Congratulations, Myth: you're my first "1" rating. This game is completely broken, as purchased off the shelf. It's bad enough that software has gone to a "release now, patch later" mentality, but at least software updates are automatic. I don't want to spend hours searching for a way to fix this game. If it's rereleased with a better manual, maybe I'll revisit it. I think there are interesting ideas in there. But as is, this is garbage.

Honestly, Merc: you should cry yourselves to sleep in shame.

This game truly deserves a '1' rating, as it's not really a game. They had some decent ideas for a card-based, cooperative combat system, and then decided to put about another 2 hours of work into designing a game around it. The materials involving text all require a heavy rewrite, not just for typos/grammar errors, but also for clarity, streamlining, standardization, and, well, to make sense to someone who didn't design the game.

Even with all the additional materials designed to help learn/teach the game, it's still a slog (because you have to get through all the additional materials designed to help learn/teach the game). And when you do figure it out, it turns out that it's a pretty repetitive dungeon crawl, where your heroes go through the same motions each time to defeat the same enemies. Looking at the stat cards for the to-be-released enemies, they'll just be more of the same.

On top of that, they didn't include everything in the base box. If you want to finish the quests, you buy an expansion. If you want the minis that the boss summons, you have to buy an expansion. If you want any variety at all in the monsters you fight? You guessed it - buy an expansion!

The minis are beautiful. That's all I can say for the game.

I "played" once with a friend. We had such a hard time trying to figure out what to do in what order. The quests are fun.

We had to check forums.

That and I felt it would lose too much during solo play as well (the only way it'd get played here). This game seems like it needs lots of players as their interaction is key to the game. It needs a different crowd too, not the Scrabble and Yahtzee lovers of my group. Bye Myth, see you later :(

I just opened the game. Sadly there were some issues. The game manual seems bitten in a few pages, also the players boards are warped. When I was doing the inventory, it was very hard to see if it was complete using only the game manual, It took me a long time to finish it and only because I found a very useful thread about it here on BGG. Very deficient component list on the game manual.

I will contact them to see about the torn manual and the warped boards.

I hope to play this soon.

I was very excited to play Myth, however it was a frustrating, time consuming and boring experience. The main reason is that no one really understood the rules, I refuse to ever sit in a game in which no one knows the rules by heart, however to be fair with my friend, it seems Myth´s rules are hard to grasp due to a bad written rulebook.

For now, I only see great components but zero game. I’m rating Myth as high as I did because I have faith there is a good game here, a friend is currently trying to decipher the rules but I think I will also read them in the near future.

I finally played Myth with the correct set of rules and it is a good and entertaining game. I really like the way The Darkness works, It is very innovative and the players really need to cooperate to solve each tile in the best possible way, if a player want to go alone he will probably get killed and will hurt his teammates. 

In the campaign mode, you get to level up and equip your character with better loot, I love this and I can’t wait to continue to play the campaign. 

On the other hand, the game has tons of content, so it is very expensive. The KS campaign just finished and I spent over $500 for extra components and expansions (and the base game is not even included in that). Another big issue, in the base game I have, the cards are very badly worded, but I think this is fixed with the KS cards.

Bottom line, I really like the game now, it is perhaps the best Dungeon Crawler game I have ever played (I still haven’t tried Shadows of Brimstone) and I want to play it again soon.

Mercs, LLC replaced my damaged components so I’m good on that area. However I decided to sell my game. I’m a completionist by heart and having everything for Myth has proven to be a very costly endeavor. A close friend have the game with all the goodies so I hope to play his copy of the game.

I already played Shadows of Brimstone, and although it has a better theme than Myth, I prefer Myth´s mechanisms.

It’s been a long time since I last played Myth, our campaign group fell apart and, to be honest, I have changed in these years. My desire to play the game has decreased a lot. In theory, I still love the ideas behind the game, but in practice I never want to play it. It is a very time consuming game and the reward it offered has decreased over time for me. Now, I mostly prefer not to play Dungeon Crawler games, I prefer to play Eurogames. The other recent change is that I played Gloomhaven this year and it was a very bad experience. Myth is the superior game for me, but even then, I don’t really want to play it again so I’m downgrading its rating. 

I still would play if requested, but I think it is best to leave Myth in my memory.

The other consideration is that the publisher stopped answering my emails and they never sent me all the expansions and goodies I backed on KS, they belong to a friend as I sold the game. I still hope they will deliver as promised. This is a bad situation, but it didn’t influence my decision to downgrade Myth´s rating. After playing Gloomhaven I reassessed my stand on Dungeon Crawlers in general, I will try to avoid them if they are fully cooperative.

I owned and traded a couple of times. More than any other game, by far, I wanted to like this game. I love the art, the idea of the game. It has the foundations of being the best game ever to me, but I was repeatedly turned off by the rough parts around the edges (difficulty learning, incomplete base components, making all the systems of the game fit together,...). In some ways I want to rate it a 10 and in other ways, maybe a 5. I'll go down the middle.

And the gameplay fits with that very well, by letting you choose what happens next and what dangers to face, in most cases. It's like no other game I've played.  It's a tactical skirmish game with miniatures, individual decks of cards for each hero, geomorphic map tiles, detailed monster rules, all in a dungeon crawl/storytelling setting that can be customized by the player(s). The components are very nice, too. 

[b]NOTE:  With the availability of the 2.0 rules and updated cards, my rating is now a 10 with some expansions (Rating is 8 with only the base game, and rating is 9 with the base game plus some skeleton minions and captains and at least the Orcneas boss).[/b]
I suspect that I will enjoy the game even more once I get the new Journeyman expansions and modules and stuff, but I can't raise the rating higher than a 10!

*** My earlier Rating was taking into account the official FAQ and guides available at megacongames.com -- without them, the original rulebook that comes with the base game is not sufficient to learn the rules, it being very holey and badly organized. My rating also went up a point after I got all the stretch goals from my Kickstarter pledge.  

I also suggest downloading the Movement Tracker cards by IronPython, here: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/101655/movement-tracker-card

Every time I play this game it gets better and better. The rulebook needs some work but it doesn't take away from the game. I love the RPG feel with rich stories. The ability to improvise sounds like fun too but I'm wanting to play through some story quest first before I get into that.

Yes, the rules are a mess. But this game is very, very fun to play. Wiping out swathes of bad guys in a heroic fashion is a great feeling! Even the base retail version offers 40-50 hours of content, which is more than most board games ever get played.

One play. Learned!. Its a great game with so much posibilities, i love it. When you have learned it its simple enough.
We had make some terrible mistakes in our first play. Im willing to try more, i hope to find a great game here.
Now i play right, now i have corrected cards. The game now makes real sense, is lacking exploration but the combat is great and satisfying. 
I have discovered a great solo game in Myth, deep, rich, and campaign driven. A dungeoncrawler that uses only a part of your table. Can be played in a small one too with proper organization. I really like it, and im trying to improve the game experience till i love it.
EDIT
New rules, better game. Now everything is clearer and better, the cards , monsters, traps. Have to make my own monsters to add variety, but this is indeed a great game. Could be fired by gloomhaven though.

Kickstarter Backer - Captain Level

Expansions Owned: Both JM
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Played at GenCon 2013. Highlights for me include:

1) turn order is entirely organic...and entirely democratic (well, at least as democratic as the group itself). Nothing is scripted, meaning the group needs to decide together (or not...Leeeeeeeeeeerooooy Jenkinnnnns!!) how best to approach a certain room.

2) card/resource management is fun! I was playing as the Archer and, while not the most demanding character, did have some tough decisions about which cards to play, which to abandon, and which to keep for future rounds.

3) while there are lots of rules to remember, they felt intuitive rather than gamey: I could see the rules clicking fairly quickly after 1 or 2 plays.

4) rules encourage player-determined game events. Want a wandering band of arachnid grubs in your trap-beset hallway? Go for it. Want a lair of orcs instead of the skeletons you faced last time? Get em on there and get to slaughtering.

Overall the game becomes a very cool (and unique) framework for cooperative play...both as a band of heroes and as a kind of collective GM shaping your own experience.

KS Captain level + various additions.
KS Minion level. Will probably add Module All-In + some stuff.
Haven't managed to play a single game, even by myself. The rulebook is a disaster!
EDIT: played a game by myself, using the 2.0 rules and watching the instructional video's. This game has potential, especially with the new modules coming up. Sucks that that wasn't implemented the first time though, I don't like having to throw money at MERCS again. Might be going to do just that though.
EDIT: Money has been thrown. I am weak.
EDIT: Myth customers service appears to be rather awesome nowadays.
EDIT: played a small adventure with some friends. Took a bit of explaining and rules-searching, a few odd looks where thrown around, the 'turn'-structure was a bit unintuitive at first and we were massacred (second quest spawned a miniboss with a hunting pack on a large tile with two spawning points), but it was a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ok, I think I would like the game if it were playable.  It looks great, but there is no way to learn how to play from the rulebook.  There is no guidance, the rulebook is a disaster, and it just isn't a game that I have been able to play.

I'm going to keep my copy for a while and see if something happens to fix these problems, but for now, Myth is a horrible disaster.

 I played the game (finally) and I love it!! It is fantastic fun, deep, challenging and rewarding. After playing through the walk through the  rule book fits perfectly into place. The guys at Megacon games made a great product!!

RATING: N/A
Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.

A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
All figures painted. I think the rules in conjunction with the one or two videos I watched were quite adequate in getting me started. I think a lot of the problem with the rulebook stems from how very different and open the game is. Once you get into the game the rulebook is quite a bit more understandable and helpful even. I really enjoy how the cycles work even though I am not fully used to it yet. It is not a quick game but I and those I have played with had fun the whole while.

FIRST IMRESSION:

The minis are numerous and quite impressive. The rules leave a lot to be desired. We're still not quite sure at the end of the day if we were playing correctly, but I think we got the gist of the game and most of it right by the end. The game was designed to be fairly free-form which is challenging for those who like a bit more direction and consistency and "playing it right". At the end of the night, two of us enjoyed it enough to be interested to play again, another was uncertain, and a fourth didn't really enjoy the inconsistency and lack of clarity in the rules. I am curious to try Slaughterfield rules at some point. 

The different roles certainly play a good bit different. The decks are quite different. There will be rounds where you do almost nothing since you drew unhelpful cards for the moment.

Yes the current rulebook is worse than bad, but it is getting updated and released in wave 2 also this game is very close to a rpg and then the rulebook is ok for a first release.
That said, the game can be played in its current state and is a pretty solid game, a few more models would have been nice tho.

Got the rest of my stuff for this game and this just makes the game awesome. Because this is a deep game some of the issues with other co-op games are not present(no alpha player taking control etc).
If this game continue to get more expansions it will just get to be so much more than a dungeon crawling boardgame and be more like a rpg(I mean this in a good way)

Many things are missing for a normal gameplay. Takes forever to set up and record. Never had less fun and more frustration playing a game. Missing components: Undead Minions and Captains, you need to buy those separately...pfff. Although you have the Lairs for undead. Missing 3 hero decks, left only 1 token for each, pretty "cool" teaser to buy extra...pfff This game is begging you to spend money on every turn so you can play it normally.

Incomplete Game. Might be build your own adventure or sand box but there is no complete game in the box. Hero card deck is a neat idea but is too random. If you don't end up with cards that combo in your hand you gona have a bad turn. Couldn't mitigate it.

RATING: 4
In for the Captain plus a bunch of add-ons 

Having received the game....I am going to wait for the rest of the add-ons before I make a final decision.

I wanted a co-op dungeoncrawler / fantasy skirmish style game.    and that's what this is.   what always left me cold with descent or D&D adventure games was that it was fairly mechanical what you did each turn.   Myth changes that by giving each character a deck that defines what they do each turn.   I really like it, and when it works well characters are jumping about, smashing minions, working together to beat bosses and captains.   Awesome.

Not so awesome?  piss poor rules.   the rules in the box are missing important pieces of information.  they bring in new terms for no reason, don't define them...and don't really need them (ahem..."pop","scout")  

the cards are written without a consistent wording scheme.  what is 'required' for one deck is just 'shield' for another.   what is 'combo' for one, isn't mentioned on another.   'shadows'  means what exactly?   depends on who at MegaCon you ask.  they needed to take all these ideas, give them to 1 person and let him re-write all the cards to work consistently.   I understand each character/deck does things differently, but Magic is able to create a consisitent keyword system that works well....we have ~150ish cards here to work with.  

it is really frustrating to tell a person who is playing a character - oh, you can't do that...or it works this way - when there is NOTHING on the cards that indicates that.   when he/she asks why, you shrug and say...yup the cards suck.  that's how you drive gamers away.

and on top of that, it sure feels like MegaCon is fed up with complaints and wishes people would just play the game that is in their heads.   

-5/8  
screw this game.   screw MegaCon Games.   I sold this and am happy about it.   and now the company they produced everything through...forgot to put their miniatures order in?  or something?  I dunno.  I'm glad to dump this game.   some good ideas, but holy crap does the company want to make it hard to like this game.   I haven't even seen wave 2.  but not it won't get to me until August?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Looks promising.  Wait and see.  Rave reviews by the Dice Tower, but it looks like it could be another Descent/Castles of Ravenloft type game but with more chrome.  Has been described as having a very strong co-op mechanic.

UPDATE:  Well, the U.S. Kickstarter backers have received their copies, and the bloom appears to be off this rose.  There is likely a really good game in the box, but I get the strong sense from the forums that this is just another undeveloped KS mess by amateur board game designers.  Too often aspiring game designers have a clever idea - maybe even several clever ideas - but the trick is to bring them all together to make a cohesive game.  Additional development might have been able to solve the "loitering rule" problem, which appears to be a difficult problem to solve without either asking players to govern their own play to make the rule unnecessary, or altering some of the basic mechanics of the game.

As I did not back this game, I also don't feel like purchasing the sub-par retail version which would require an additional $200+ investment to get the variety of the KS version.  I should also add that it appears that the retail version is largely incomplete.

Much to chaotic. The rules feeled complex without having much of a purpose. Story missions were to download, which we could not find (german version). Rules left many things hard to understand or open to interpretation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I liked the idea of the deck-based characters/combat and long term progression, but the rulebook is a huge steaming pile. Needs a gazillion house-rules and willingness to make up rules to be able to play. You cannot know how to play the game with the rulebook alone. The only way to understand this game is to watch videos and read forums online.

Also, The world is open-ended. This is not really much of a game. It is more of a toolkit (unless you spend $$$ on the modules). Buyer beware.

I was faced with unloading this game or spend $200+ more (on top of the $100++) to get the upgrades and the modules needed to really enjoy it... No thanks.

Despite what the haters say, this game is amazing. Are the rules terrible beyond belief? Yes. Does it seem like they never even play-tested outside of the group of creators? Absolutely. But, is it an amazing amount of fun when you actually do take the time to learn the convoluted rules? HECK YES! This game really is a ton of fun with some beautiful peices. My suggestion would be to find someone who has it and seriously give it a try. It will be worth your time.

RATING: 6
Kickstarted.  Loved, and still love, the idea of the game and the promise of a fully co-op dungeon crawler with roleplaying elements.  Sadly, this one didn't live up to that promise; it is a hack-n-slash with limited loot drops, an adventure game with very similar and limited quests, and a roleplaying game with very limited character advancement.  Great minis, tiles, and tokens, but not so great gameplay, and tons of missteps regarding rules and cards.

Oh, and this is also a terrible game for 2 players.  You are highly limited in terms of which heroes you can realistically play, scaling is quite poor in that many monsters and bosses are simply not suited for 2 heroes, and each player playing multiple heroes is hard to manage given the card play mechanics.

Shame that the actual game itself and the rules are ambiguous and unplayable, 
As an experienced boardgamer/roleplayer/miniatures gamer - the design of this game is inexcusable. "hey, if something doesn't make sense - just make it up!" - I say "NO - DESIGN A GAME WITH PROPER RULES!"

I think Myth suffered for the rulebook that wasn't as good as it should have been, especially since Myth comes with a lot of highly unusual and creative mechanisms. Also, players have a much higher degree of freedom about what the game throws at them. If you look for a game that clearly tells you what to do, look somewhere else. If you like to decide for yourself what you are to face, give Myth a try.
In my opinion, it is one of the best dungeon crawlers ever made, which offer unique play styles for each heroe class which I've seen never before as well implemented as in Myth.

Good game if you're willing to put the work into it. It's definitely fiddly and some of the rules aren't intuitive. The promise of equipping characters with new equipment and upgrading their deck of abilities has me hopeful about Myth. Oh, and the miniatures are cool.

UPDATE: After reading through the new 2.0 starter module, Stone of Life, I'm convinced that Myth will require more time and energy than I'm willing to give it. I have a growing number of games that are far easier and more rewarding to play. I've decided to move on.

UPDATE 2: Since the news that the Myth property is being sold, I've been hopeful that the new owners can develop it sufficiently into a game worth playing.

Monster rulebook that ends up being a mess.  And honestly the wording on some the cards is just as sloppy.  The smaller miniatures look good and the larger ones look great.  Component quality is top notch too.

But, we're being forced to wing-it through each game not because we want to and not for fun, we're winging it because we literally are spending too much time flipping through a crappy rulebook with holes in it.

IMO unplayable out of the box - you HAVE to rely on the BGG faq and forums to get through the game without making decisions on the fly (and often wrong).

KS edition.  Worst rulebook I've ever seen (this includes Magic Realm, Dystopian Wars, and a myriad of other awkward tomes I've waded through in my 30+ years of gaming).  Bloated, awkward, contradictory, typo-ridden, confusing, few interesting decisions and much frustration from poor card draws led our group to pan this one.  Fantastic minis, beautiful components and the promise of a new rulebook do little to save this game.  And even after you wade through the awful rulebook, endless videos and tutorials, there just isn't a very good game there.  Shame.  It sounded so interesting on kickstarter...

Dear Myth Folks,

The next time you make a game, find a group interested in playing it, give them the box, the rule book and a video camera.  Do not let them talk to you about anything.  Have them film their first few games and watch the footage to see what they got right and what they got wrong and then, and here's the important bit, you can fix the rulebook.

The retail version has some problems but the moment to moment gameplay is amaizing. I'm glad that fans are finally starting to make story arcs for the game because it has so much potential but the random story cards just don't do it justice. 

I try and play other coop games but I keep coming back because the dynamic balance between the players choices triggering enemy activation is to tense and rich... This mechanic (darkness vs hero cycle) makes all other coops feel like a collection of random dice throws. 

I'm really looking forward to the future of this franchise.

Right now I consider it an 8.5 but I suspect it will become a perfect 10 as the system become refined and gets more support.

This game has not aged well or lived up to my "buyer's bias" as one of the Kickstarters.

This game is not playable out of the box.  The rules are a mess and the card text is ridiculous.  You have to read the hero card faq for a good chunk of cards.  If they rewrite the rulebook, I will re-rate the game.

Update: I've read a lot of the posts, the rules and the unofficial FAQ. I feel comfortable playing this game now.  It is a disappointing pile of garbage.  It is clear that the game was not adequately play tested.

This is the poster child for why I will not Kickstart boardgames unless it is by someone I very VERY much trust, and who has an impeccable track record. Seems to me that at least 80% of kickstarted boardgames have the issues this game has, although to a usually much smaller extreme. Most notably, weak or nonexistent play testing and badly edited or terrible/ completely inadequate rules.

And I do find it hilarious the number of breathless '10!!!!!!!!!!!!11111!!'s this game has, many by people that I'm certain never attempted to play it. Just more proof that ANY game, no matter how broken or terrible it is, will get a good number of perfect scores if it has plastic minis. Also, I wonder how many of the righteous defenders of this game on release are playing it nowadays? (or for that matter, even using those much adored minis for anything) I'd bet virtually zero. This type of unwitting guerilla marketing is the worst thing about BGG by far.

Played a friend's copy. He sold it soon after for a profit. Amazing.

8 for initial rollout of the game and challenges faced (rulebook, cards, logistics).  I expect this to improve as McG sorts out their support (spoiler - they never do).  Still, I love the concept and miniatures.  I enjoy this game and expect it to have longevity on my table.  (Another spoiler - it didn't)

If you're a rules lawyer, this game isn't for you!

Time has soured me on this game - the owners (Megacon Games) are a train wreck.  They currently don't care about the property or the community.  They claim there's a new owner coming in.  I just don't think this turd can be polished.

Not the disaster many have made it out to be.  True, nothing Earth-shattering, but I had a good time.  It was pretty difficult to get going and the rulebook was not really great, with a lot of information hidden higgeldy- piggeldy.  The box was certainly crammed with stuff.  The action mechanisms and timing of baguy response was interesting, but not sure how I feel about the 'one die roll for all' type actions.  Mainly fighting oriented.  Our quest had some kind of silly backstory, but I'm sure there a wide variety.  The little metal character tags were certainly overdone but pretty nifty.  Rather oddball game, to be sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a really hard game to write about.  Out of the box (2.0 materials), there are very high start up costs to figuring out how to play.  I watched several hours of videos and my wife and I both read the rules several times.  Our first two play attempts resulted in serious frustration.  Also, out of the box, the game has limitations.  There is little (if any) character advancement because there is only one quest with one boss (so you can't get titles and keep items).

That said, we pushed through and have started enjoying this game.  The keys are to (1) be ok with the startup costs and (2) be ok with the fact that it's a storytelling game... you're going to mess up rules... things are going to be muddy and unclear.  You just have to enjoy the story and the interesting combat co-op tactics enough to let that slide.

I kind of think of this as Mice and Mystics for more gamer grownups.

I greatly disliked it in execution even though I like some many of the ideas behind it.

Apparently my 1st edition rulebook part of the culprit.

I also found that monsters clumped like crazy. It often felt like I would set up a board, then build a block of monsters that advanced as a block of monsters. Then I would try to do my best with the hand available.

I have no problem with that. I love Mage Knight. I just didn't like the way it worked in Myth and I found the combat boring.

I might give it another shot someday given that I have friends who think highly of it.

I'm one of the rare retail purchasers. I thought I would give this game a go based on the promising reviews from Dice Tower and Drive Through Reviews. I knew going in that learning the rules was going to take an obscene amount of effort on my part too, but I was optimistic. After watching videos, reading cheat sheets, downloading FAQs, reading forum discussions, etc. - this game desperately needs an editor. The rulebook is very disorganized (as if it was a high school group project, everyone picked one chapter to write, and then it was bound together - not cohesive, confusing, lots of holes) and the cards are not intuitive at all and lack the basic option of being played "upside down" for a base action at anytime. The components are very nice, but I can't play this game until rules are reworked.

Although we struggled often with the rulebook, the game play itself is delightful - it manages to be co-op without allowing for quarterbacking, I adore the card combo plays, and the triggering of the Darkness phase feels organic rather than mechanical (since it can happen mid-hero phase), and the mini-quests that can become quest-chains adds some cool narrative continuity on top of the story quests in the booklet. I feel like this game is far superior to Descent, as well as the D&D games like Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft, which feel either gamey, broken, or, too light.

Dear god, the controversy and pain over this.  I really hope it holds up by the time it arrives, if ever.

Update Dec 2014 - played the game a few times now and am starting to really enjoy it.  The rules are a staggering barrier to entry, but the gameplay SEEMS fairly simple if you can get someone to teach you.  Also quite difficult as I cannot beat the walkthrough adventure yet.  And the method of determining your games' difficulty is very ad hoc and random.  Minis and tiles are excellent though, and the Captain pledge was enormous value for money.

Wow do the rules in this game blow!  Fortunately the second edition rules allow you to get started. I am not sure how anyone could play the game out of the box without the second edition rules or online help.  At any rate, the components are excellent.  And the game play is more interesting than other dudes in hallways games.  It has more interesting choices than Star Wars Imperial Assault or Mice & Mystic due to the individual decks of cards for each hero.  There are also excellent decisions created from the Darkness track that allows the heroes to do just a bit. . . and then the monsters attack.  Also, resetting the heroes and refreshing your hands to try and get those killer combos is tempting, but pushes you further on the Darkness Track.  And no one hero can do all of the killing, you have to spread the fun, or the bad guys get really strong and target the selfish hero.  But with all of that going for it, it still is not as good as Mage Knight.  Mage Knight has a far more interesting deck management/usage system than Myth.  One might argue that Myth is easier, but the rules are so poorly written and organized, that I actually find Mage Knight less fiddly.

(Played 2.0)  I really enjoyed this game once I was able to process and understand the rules.  The game is somewhat open ended in how you approach scenarios, allowing you to ratchet up or down the difficulty.  The card action selection mechanism is enjoyable.  My biggest issue with the game is my brain started burning out on the game after a few plays trying to keep track of the rules.  Small issue, the Crawler minis are two different types, but look very similar from a different, definitely need to paint to tell the difference easily.

Great potential, wonderful visual production values (minis and boards), terrible textual production values, boring rules, bad game design, arbitrary gameplay, nonsensical quests, terrible game.

Too much is left up to the player making the difficulty arbitrary rather than adjustable. Rules are overly complex with little payoff. Turns are often arbitrarily limited by cards in hand. Characters upgrade in minimal ways. Littered with a massive number of typos in the rules and cards (appears to have not been proofread by a professional, or even an amateur). Cards effects at times vague or nonsensical. Numerous board elements provided that do nothing and serve no purpose.

Quests often make no sense in the context of the scenario, and often include vague rules that are open to interpretation. Most tile quests also change the gameplay so significantly that they are invalid in the current chapter quest when they clearly should have been made generic enough to work in a variety of situations.

The game was obviously never properly playtested (only playtests were with people who had the rules explained by the creators - no blind playtests conducted) and the quality control for anything other than the models/boards was non-existent.

This game is a whole mess. It may have cool components and a great idea behind it but has a game it fails to deliver.

Most of the games are still being written, by FAQs, by a new rulebook, by rules that are only on the designers head and were told once in some convention... the support from the company is miserable, denying obvious faults and blaming the ones who bought their product for being too much angry.

The purpose of being a "sandbox" game is all wrong, or is it supposed to also have "sandboxed" rules by customers and community?!

If you have money to waste and you don't mind an incomplete product, buy this game.

Love :
- that it's a co-op dungeon crawler without gamemaster
- the design (tiles, cards and minis)
- the deck management/building mechanics

I don't understand what's so bad about the 1.0 rules. 
Yes, you have to read the rulebook several times ; yes, you won't find all the answers needed on the same page and yes, you'll have to interpret them sometimes or add the one you need. But you can say that about most of big board games.

Would have loved :
- cardboard tokens instead of plastic miniatures (to get much more monsters in the base game !)
- to have some indications of the difficulty for the Quest Cards ("if it's your first time playing, start with this Quest")

Will buy the two Journeyman Expansions.

---- Preliminary thougts ----
It seems to be the perfect Dungeon Crawler for me:
- Highly cooperative: you don't just share objetives, you really must cooperate to achieve the moral you will fail
- Medium to heavy complexity: you don't just move randomly, roll some dice, kill some bad guys, get XP, level up, get treasures, etc.
- Characters really are unique: they don't simply specialize in melee, etc., they really play out completely different, much more than any other game out there
- Free form: it doesn't have a list of scenarios you can play and that's all, there's a way of doing random scenarios
- Miniatures, artwork and components look awesome

My two cents:  yes, the rulebook is horrendous.  And, yes, it's a shame that some of the components in the base game do not link up perfectly.

All that said, having now played several times both solo and with friends, I really enjoy the mechanics of this game -- combat is elegant and allows for interesting strategic decisions without become overburdened, and character development across quests is fun.

I'm looking forward to the release of more content to flesh out the game world (especially more quests!) and to add some diversity to the monster list as well.

My opinion of the game is very similar to that of Rahdo, as expressed in his video. The game components are beautiful and the investment in the game is apparent - the minis and tiles are amazing, the characters are well developed and the variety is unbelievable. I particularly like the deck management system for each character - it makes this a unique co-op that overcomes the alpha gamer problem by giving each player the complicated task of learning and managing their deck. A really superb idea and from my somewhat experience playing it, very well done. 

Yet the game, as it arrived, is kind of a hot mess. The designers have worked really hard to improve and fix, and supplied with videos, downloadable pdfs and even printed add-ons that try to mitigate that. I found that it was not worth it for me - you have to work a lot to make this game playable, and not because you spend the time figuring out how to beat the game but you will spend the time figuring out how to play the game. If you are happy to invest all that time and effort in one game, you will have a great experience. I personally prefer a greater variety of games.

I had the KS Captains Pledge that Includes:

Rules not explained well, key words missing on cards, unhelpful reference material written in the same manner as the original rule book thus far...

UPDATE: Jumped from 5 to 7 after my first play. The first play is a slog, prepare to reference the rules a lot, and get them wrong, a lot. After about 5 or six turns you should have a good feel of things and might be able to take the training wheels off, but you'll still be doing it wrong. 

That said, it's fun. I think after a few sessions we'll be ready to deal with persistent characters and have the rules at 99%.

UPDATE 2: Dropped a half point, my group is pretty disheartened at the rules issues which continue to crop up around every corner. We still had fun, but have decided to shelf this until the new rule documents are shipped. 

MCG did themselves a massive disservice by not having a technical writer/editor work on their rulebook. There's a good game in here, but I'm waiting to learn how to play correctly. Will update score again after the official rule supplements are available.

UPDATE 3: Putting this down to a 4 for now. We'll see after wave 2, but I'm not a fan of the game incrementally getting to where it should have been at launch. Whatever great ideas are in this game, someone is going to take them and do them better. I've shelved this with no intention of doing anything other than painting the minis.

UPDATE 4: A few things to note about the minis - they don't fit in well with standard 28mms, they are quite cartoony and have overly exaggerated features (more-so than normal for minis). Additionally, since these are pre-assembled, you often are fighting giant gaps. It takes a lot of greenstuff to get a smooth transition on a lot of these guys. The mold lines are inconsistent, but a real problem in some cases, and other times not an issue at all. For the general board gamer, these are nice pieces (probably north of very nice even), but for a miniature person, they aren't really that good. I guess the nice thing is they paint up quickly, there isn't much in the way of buckles, belts, and pouches and detailed things that take a lot of time. Only dropping a tenth of a point, but still, I continue to be disappointed by Myth.

LAST UPDATE: The company is still trying to sink this game. And for my part, they are succeeding. I spent the $6 to fix the game in the 2nd KS, only to find out now I have to spend extra shipping to cover some of the expansion content fixes I need as well. I would have paid more up front for an all inclusive fix, but no way will I keep getting strung along for a buck here and a buck there to fix something that should have been done correctly a long long time ago. 

These guys are about as amateur as it gets, and their policies will sink them. Rating includes a lot of sentiment about the company itself, as the two are heavily intertwined and your experience with one will be heavily influenced by the other.

God I love this game.  I really want to give it a better score with every ounce of my soul.  But....the distinct lack of organized rules.  The designers should be ashamed.  They soooooo need to hire a technical writer to get an actual rule set out of them.

But I do love it so.

It's like that super trashy girl you just don't want to take home to mama.  But...


yeah.

An interesting tactical cooperative adventure game that uses a unique card drive combat system. The revised 2.0 rules get you into the game fast and once learned, the game becomes fairly intuitive. 

Pros:
* Excellent art work
* Great looking miniatures
* Unique card driven combat system

Cons:
* -1 for including a female archer making that character unusable without the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameaccessory/166944/myth-alternate-gender-heroes]Myth: Alternate Gender Heroes[/url] expansion.
* The game is designed so you do not easily keep equipment you find after each act which does not make any logical sense.

This is an cute monster-mashing dungeon crawling game. It's fully co-operative which is nice. The game also has a flexible difficulty system which is nice. Each character plays very differently, in that each character's abilities are driven by a deck of action cards that have lots of cute quirks as to how they are played. The quests and cards have a good sense of humor, and a lot of pop-culture references which is cute as well.

The original game does have one of the worst rulebooks of all time, although the underlying game has always been enjoyable. This has been resolved with the 2.0 rules and cards release, which is available in a few places if you look for it.

Great game with a high learning curve.  You have to watch a lot of videos to understand the minutiae of the game.  Once you figure that stuff out, it is an excellent game with awesome miniatures.

Myth is in my opinion a very interesting mix of a table top role playing game, a dungeon crawler and a trading card game. You could say it is light in all those genres, but I think it blends some of the best aspects of all of them together in a pretty cohesive package. 

I love how the characters have distinct abilities that work of each other to creative combinations between cards and players. Makes it a lot more interesting than just rolling dice. 

The miniatures are of above average quality for a board game and I would say about average for a miniature game. Not the most detailed, but they fit the art style perfectly. On the plus side they are pretty easy to paint.

It should be noted that thanks to a rather cumbersome rule book that expects you to read between the lines. The game can be a bit hard to learn. However once you know it, it is fairly easy to learn to others.

This is a good game. It is unfortunate that megacon's repeated mistakes in delivering the game to their supporters is, in no small part, hurting its reception. As for the rulebook controversy, I think this was blown out of proportion. Admittedly, there were some important omissions in the rules, but they have subsequently been addressed. Hopefully, enough people give this game a chance as there is a good game system here with some nice components and innovation.

We have played this a few times now, enough for me to form a coherent opinion. Of course, a game with the breadth and depth of Myth is difficult to define. Myth demands a lot of your time, of course this isn't surprising because of what it is (tactical-emergent storytelling-dungeon crawler). There is a lot of... stuff, bunches of detailed miniatures, piles of cards, and chits. It has a fascinating card based combat system for the heroes and a mildly clunky movement and combat system for the monsters, but it all works well together. What Myth lacks for me is direction, and what it lacked in all of our plays was a coherent rule system. I was able to suss out how everything worked, but it was far, far, more difficult than it should have been and I honestly couldn't tell you exactly how to play anymore. The rules issue has been addressed and I look forward to getting a copy of the revised rules from the second Kickstarter, but I just don't know if this will see much love due to my much greater interest in Issac Childres' Gloomhaven system. But we will see, plastic doesn't decay and I have no interest in trading or selling Myth, so maybe someday.

I want to love this game. It was my #1 most anticipated kickstarter ever. After three reads through the rulebooks and downloading every player aid available, I still can't even get through a single tile of a quest. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I'll spend hours looking through the rulebook to find where a specific rule is referenced, just to find it isn't mentioned ANYWHERE. Until the rulebook gets a complete overhaul, I don't consider this a game. Unbelievably frustrating.

RATING: 10
First of all, the ratings for this game should be ignored because many people may have bought/played this game without knowing what they were getting into.   This is probably one of the best co-op game that I have ever played but it definitely has a niche audience.  

Luckily, my friends and I are that audience.  WE LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
 

**Who should *NOT* play this game**
This game is NOT for the non-gamer or party gamer. This is not for the player that can't dedicate time to playing it. It is also not for someone who expects to understand the game in 10 minutes. This game is not for the showboater or the player that cannot play cooperatively. This is not for a player that cannot communicate with their fellow players. It is not for the player that cannot pace themselves or sacrifice for the greater good.  This game is not for the rule monger. Lastly, I don't know how to put this delicately.  It's not for stupid people.  

If I haven't scared you away, then this may be a game for you.  This game is one of the most brilliant games that I have ever played.  Everyone seems to compare this to D&D or Descent.  It really isn't like either one of them.  There is no game that I have ever played that really compares to the feel of this one.  Each Hero Cycle (turn) players really need to discuss the way they are going to play their turn.   You can play in any order, but that order matters.  If you do a move too early the monsters will get to attack more often than is neccesary.  If you move to fast, then bad things happen.  If you move too slow, you don't get max loot. Then again, you still might not anyways.  

I started this game by myself, then brought in a friend who fell in love with it.  After a few sessions, I brought another friend in who emailed me the next day asking where he can buy it and when the next game session was going to be. 

 It's definitely got a learning curve, so I didn't want to have to explain it to too many players at once.  


I've read through the reviews and everyone dogs the rules on this game.  I know the rules could have been written better and this needs a little attention. But, the game itself is amazing and shouldn't be dissed so hard for just the rules.  Most games that I play, I watch videos and read online guides anyways.  This takes a little more attention, but once you get the concept, it's a really easy game.  That being said, this game still isn't for idiots.  


This is now one of my favorite games of all time.  I really look forward to playing it every chance I get.

 
I LOVE THIS GAME!!

The strength of the game is the amount of variety in the characters, some of the best character diversity you are likely to find but it is let down by mechanics that can be hard to grasp (I was a kickstarter backer and the first print rule book was not very good) also it has a complexity that you have to be in the mood for. 

Good if your in the mood for it but too much effort if you don't have a few hours spare.

Love this game after getting the upgrade 2.0 rules. The original rules are basically a reference that is put together with no organization whatsoever. With all that said, I really enjoy this game! It feels like an much better updated version of Warhammer Quest. The components are top notch. The card mechanic works very well. I think all the low ratings of this game are unwarranted and even though anger is justified, giving up is not! The company is trying to make things right. I feel we need to give the company a chance to make this game what it can be, AWESOME! The 1 ratings are ridiculous, my real rating is an 8.

03-11-2014. Rated after 2 solo plays. A lot has been said about Myth. Myth is a sandbox cooperative dungeoncrawler with fantastic mini's and artwork. 

The game has no fixed turn order, but the actions of the heroes together increase the "darkness". When the Darkness reaches 6, the baddies fight back. In the meanwhile the heroes cooperative decide which actions to take and how to proceed using a sort of deck-building mechanism in which the cards build combos. THAT JUST IS A FANTASTIC MECHANISM.

I am a little less impressed by how quests chain (sometimes it breaks down) and how monster movement is governed. Monsters react to due to several rules and sometimes they're smart and move really complicated. The stupid monsters are easier to move around, but I think the mechanism is a little less well done than for example the D&D boardgame system.

Then, the bad things, the rulebook is admittedly not very clear. I think they've done a good job but the game is a beast to learn. It's just complicated, with many exceptions and stuff to learn.

I actually believe this is an excellent dungeon crawl, with way more to offer than most people can see. The problem is that the rulebook is just impossible to use to learn the game. The company has put up videos and guides. These are necessary to learn the game. I think if you want the best Dungeon crawl you need to take the time to learn this game. If they could get a better rulebook I would give this a 9. It took just a long time to figure it out for my first and only play. RW

This game is a /mess/ in the original edition. Really really hard to play right. Recently played with the 2.0 rules, and they helped some (although I still had to reference the 1.0 now and then). Also, we set up an almost unwinnable scenario for ourselves, so that sucked. 

But the game. OMG, the game is really really good. It's grabbed my brain and won't let go.

This isn't a game.  It's a combat system with some notes about how to use it to play a game, except that the system itself is ostensibly described in a 60-page unedited, unorganized pile of indecipherable crap they claim is a rule book, and the cards that implement it are so error-ridden they'll send any editor screaming off into the night.

Apparently, if you spend several more hours reading another ten pages of FAQ and how-to videos, then you can supposedly get it to the point that you can house rule it into something playable.  (Assuming you don't try to go through with the scenarios in the box, which require more pieces than come in the box.)  Or, you could spend that time playing several other games which are actually enjoyable.

The best that can be said is that minis are decent and maps are okay, so I could use the components for D&D fights (as long all I want to fight are bugs and orcs).

The game can be fun, but I don't like the freeform questing proposed by the game. Also the character aren't balanced, some are much stronger than others. Many rules aren't clear enough and the design team took a long time to release a FAQ.

This game is dragged down by it's horrible rulebook.  The questing mechanics would be fine, but using them to populate the boards while you're doing a story quest already is just stupid.  Major house ruling is needed to fix this broken ass game.  Even with all that it can really drag on longer than welcome when doing a major story quest.  I like the persistent characters and the basic mechanics of the game, but there's just too much that isn't clearly defined in what is easily the worst rulebook I have ever encountered.

This game plays great solo and it plays great co-op.  It has that lasting progression that I love.  The kickstarter was amazing and I'm looking forward to all the variety that's coming in the mail AND all the variety that has yet to be announced.  It's co-op Diablo in a box, but it has just enough story to give me the sense that I'm not just killing guys and triggering traps, but playing through an actual storyline.  Great game if you take the time necessary to learn it (read everything available online and offline, you will be rewarded for your investment).

RATING: 4
Now, don't get me wrong, this is a very, very good game and I want to like it so bad.  I probably want to like this game more than any other game I've ever played.  I just can't.

First of all, the reasons I do think it is a good game and want to like it is because it has amazing theme, production value, and mechanics.  The game is a dungeon crawl where players are attempting to complete a quest that follows a coherent and thematic story.  There is an incredible amount of customization with the game right down to which tiles you pick to make up the map at some points.  The art and miniatures are both beautiful and of great quality.  This game definitely looks pretty on the table and would look even more beautiful if painted.  And the mechanics do some really neat things I haven't seen before.  I like the idea of a completely cooperative dungeon crawl without the need for a "dungeon master" of sorts.  The flow of the game is really unique and works really well.  Each action the heroes take costs AP and when the number of AP used hits 6 or more the bad guys get to act.  This is a neat way to represent the passing of time and "pseudo-simultaneous" acts of the heroes and darkness.  All the heroes' abilities and items are different and do a wide variety of neat things.  I love the amount of content (cards-wise!) that comes with the game.  It can make for some very fun and varied games.

But none of that means a damn, honestly.

First of all, despite the 80-page size of the rulebook it is very bad and incomplete.  I feel like very little testing went into the game because there are so many rules problems that pop up even on your first play that aren't explained at all.  There are entire concepts that aren't defined at all in the rulebook too, not just how rules interact but, for example, the poison condition isn't described when several hero abilities and monsters cause poison!  Sure, there are many FAQs that try to explain a lot of this but who wants to spend more time searching for rules online after reading an 80-page rulebook?  And a lot of those FAQs are workarounds and band-aid fixes because the game wasn't play-tested and solutions to those problems really don't exist within the universe of the game.  It's not my job to fix your game, developers.  Test it before you print it!

Even worse though is the extremely hostile miniatures model they are trying to sell this game with.  In all honesty, I like the mechanics, gameplay, and production value of the game so much that if it weren't for this I would have read all those FAQs, kept the game, and defended it against the haters.  But this is a board game, there are clear differences between this and most miniature games, yet MERCS LLC (a miniatures-game company) want to make a board game and get miniatures value out of it.

The base game (non-Kickstarter) doesn't even come with enough models to properly play a two-player game using any scenario.  Two-players requires the least amount of plastic and you will still, FREQUENTLY, run out of miniatures.  They want you to buy more in packs to supplement your game.  And the prices for these are kind of outrageous.  15-20 bucks for a set of plastic pieces.  When I buy a Descent expansion for just a little more I get more plastic plus a bunch of cardboard content for my game as well.

Kickstarter probably made this game worth it for a lot of people.  For a 100-dollar contribution you get a lot of extra plastic in addition to your 70-80 dollar game.  And if you don't want to fuss with the rules, those Kickstarter pledges are being resold for 3-4x what they paid for them.  But I'm not going to let myself be price gouged like that and I'm not going to buy into a game that is going to cost me 20-40 dollars right off the bat to play what comes in the base box, let alone the countless hours I would need to read to even learn the game.

This is a major fixer-upper and there are too many good games out there to bother with it.  FFG, you will keep getting my money for Descent.

Anything you've heard about this being difficult to learn is true.  The rule book is an acknowledged mess.

  I also think Mercs made a big mistake not more carefully selecting the contents of the base game to make sure everything worked together.  A lot of cards reference things that aren't included, and I believe that was another serious mistake on their part.  

In spite of all that, there's a lot of fun to be had, once one has learned how to play.  I think this will be a title that I enjoy both multi-player and solitaire for years to come.

Tentative rating for the Myth system, not necessarily the contents of the base retail box.

[b]Context[/b]
Typically I dislike this genre of RPG-lite games because they are the worst of all worlds: engaging neither as strategy games (i.e., offering interesting decisions) nor as RPGs (actual role-playing and thematic immersion). It's just plastic miniatures and random numbers. 

[b]The good[/b]
Myth is a pure co-op game where players act in whatever order they like, but after each six "action points"' worth of cards are played (across all players), the AI-controlled monsters attack.

Each character has its own deck of cards, and each plays quite differently; generally speaking, each has a slightly different resource-management puzzle: for example, the Archer needs to collect arrows because her most powerful attacks expend them; the Brigand is weak unless she takes time to chain other abilities with a slink into the shadows.

The result is a rather engaging hand- and resource-management puzzle with characters with strong and thematically appropriate distinctions.

There's a spatial element to the board-play too, of course, with most of the strategy centering on manipulating the AI and the timing of its turns. Whether or not this feels too "gamey" is going to be a matter of taste; I think it works well at reflecting that the heroes are supposed to be more intelligent than the hordes of goblins, insect-things, ratlings and so on. By contrast, it's always a little annoying in 1-vs-many variations on this theme that the mooks have the dungeon master's grasp of strategy.

The variety in the monster types is significant, the traps are delightfully nasty and there is evidently room for expansion.

[b]The bad[/b]
At this point, the much-argued problems with the rules are more or less resolved, I think, though it's still pretty much a disaster to get a few friends and try and learn to play together. Someone needs to take the time to read the rules from cover to cover first, with errata, unofficial rewrite etc.

I'm not enamoured of the "make it up as you go along" style of gameplay (for example, in some circumstances players choose the number or type of monsters to spawn). The game is substantially harder with, say, lairs of two different types on a tile rather than two lairs of the same monster, and likewise a pack of 8 monsters is self-evidently more than twice as difficult as a pack of 3. In general I have found it no great trauma to offload these decisions onto dice, but I would prefer a formula for scaling the difficulty.

While the core gameplay is very solid, some of the additional features feel a little underdeveloped, e.g. the allies, the treasure mechanism, and serendipity. In practice, while many elements feel customizable, the game works best without it. The core mechanism seems to lend itself to deck-construction, for example, but the rate suggested by the rules -- at most one card per quest -- likely works out to less than one card exchanged per six hours of play, [i]if[/i] you don't take the (generally amazing) quest title instead. That's fine, it's just a little unfortunate that the game seems most rewarding for the casual (every time you play it's all new) or the extremely hardcore (it is played so much that buffs so infrequent are actually meaningful).

In any case, without difficulty that scales with acquired treasures, much of the challenge will be lost if heroes were to start each quest tricked out with all the best equipment.

[b]tl;dr[/b]
At last, a dungeon crawl for strategy gamers.

I really want to like this game and have played it quite a few times. The revised 2.0 rules help a lot but it's still sort of a mess. Encounters seem to scale poorly with number of players and there's a ridiculous amount of randomness. I love the idea and the components but it's just too fiddly for me.

RATING: 1
For the record, the game is LITERALLY NOT PLAYABLE out of the box. Go to the Myth page and download the Myth_setup file. That actually tells you how to play. I don't how the frick a company leaves out HOW TO PLAY THE GAME from the rules, but somehow they managed it. You'll also need to find a draw bag; the rules assume but it is not included.
After two of us read the rules and the 11 page unofficial FAQ and some official FAQs and all the BGG rulings pages, we attempted to play - and gave up in the first room as virtually everything we did we ran into confusion on. Even when we remember that something was in the rules, we usually couldn't find it in the 60 page rulebook with the useless glossary that doesn't actually include keywords.
The variety is abysmal; there are only 2 monster types included in the game (plus four "boss" type things). Icons and text are about as confusing as they can possibly be.
Oh, and how you set things up? Well mostly you just pick what you decide to meet. Seriously? The only reason we bought this game rather than just playing a dungeoncrawl RPG is so we can play an adventure without making it ourselves. That's not giving us "freedom", that's not bothering to actually make a game.
The card text is terrible and confusing. The tiles have nearly indistinguishable colored lines.
Somewhere under there, after mucking through a lot of forums and writing up reference sheets, there's something that might be an OK game, but even at its best every step of the game is awkward. The mechanics don't work together well; nothing smoothly integrates with anything else.

This game has the potential to be a 10/10, but at the moment it isn't there. It has the worst manual I've seen in all my life and it's got errors on some of the cards. Not typos, errors. It's a shame the creators haven't been more careful.
But once figured out, the game really is a blast.

Watch the new videos to learn the game. Then use the rulebook and card guide for reference during play.

Myth is a bold open world adventure game. The closest comparison would be the pathfinder adventure card game but myth delivers miniatures play and tactics along with it's persistent world. The world has even more detailed persistence than PACG with characters that react and remember your choices.

Doing something new is never perfect but in spite of the rulebook and card text problems I am fully confident the game will be in my collection and see play for years to come.

An incredible sandbox game that began plagued with problems and is starting to bloom now that the rules 2.0 are out. I hadn't had such laughs playing in years, although I'm lucky I have a very good gaming group for this one. I even like our discussions about rules and text interpretations, this one makes my brain hurt in a good way.

A true collaborative game, nobody feels kept out or lead by others, and I like this very much too. 

My games played relate to sessions, and we play for hours when we get together... Will keep updating the rating, hopefully for the better.

After one year and a half and similar games in this genre, I still would love to play Myth but somehow I can't find the time. I'll keep checking in order to follow its evolution.

Upon receiving the first Kickstarter wave, this was a bit more difficult to get into than I was expecting. However, the backbone of the game is very interesting and I love the artwork and the miniatures. The second Kickstarter wave should really help this game along, and I highly anticipate my rating improving as the kinks get ironed out.

RATING: 2
As a reminder, all those 10* reviews are from people who pre-ordered it and never came back after trying to play it.

Pro(s): The entirety of the Myth ruleset and FAQ were created by passionate Geeks here on Boardgamegeek spending hundreds of personal hours where Mercs, LLC failed.

Cons: Those same rules were supposed to be included in the "game" box. The "designers" decided this wasn't necesarry.
--- The retail box does not come with enough miniatures to play the small amount of quests or even single tiles in the retail box. It's like an "Oops, All Berries!" cereal box but the complete opposite: "Oops, no berries..."
--- The HUNDREDS of card components that comprise the entirety of game play have a separate downloadable guide to translate them from English to Readable English.
--- The rules will take about 6 more hours to learn than any other game of similar complexity/depth due to poor design choices and the next bullet:
--- There was no playtesting of this game, as admitted by the designers. Who needs it, right?
--- They didn't feel the need or have a technical editor or editor either, the grammar and layout of each card will teach you that right away without being told.

Summary: If you bought the retail version of the game, sorry, it's unplayable out of the box and the components are fucked up. But if you spend 10+ hours on BGG and keep your phone handy to "translate" cards and rules you'll do fine even without enough miniatures.

I know, I know... It's just not for me.

Difficult to learn, even more difficult to teach.
Too many keywords, too many "special rules"
Cooperative, perfect information, alpha player issue
Dice fest

It's a surprisingly balanced dice driven combat system, for people who are looking for ADND combat on a board. I am not.

The last thing that held my interest was the soft-legacy campaign progression. It takes about 1-3 plays to advance one little bit of one little campaign by a little bit. I don't have all my life to play this game. Wanna buy it off me?

This is really more like an rpg system, and it needs to be treated like such.

There will be ambiguities, and Mercs is guilty of being less clear than they could have been, but there is a fun game in here. Someone just needs to take the reins as GM and it'll be fine.

I've had the game since before the fixes were released and have had little problem learning the game. It did take some time, but like I mentioned above, you have to treat it like learning a new rpg system and not like learning a new board game.

The engine is the best I've seen in a dungeon crawler by far. Gameplay is brilliant, and the characters really play different. The game has some downsides though, and the answer to the question if you will like this game will be very much influenced by how you weigh those flaws, even in version 2.0, to which I am referring.

First, the core box doesn't deliver the feeling that you get a whole, playable game. The only miniboss that's in there doesn't fit to the other monsters. You basically need to buy add ons, be it miniatures, be it modules.

The quest based open adventure modus leaves many setup decisions in the hands of the player without guiding him or her. Also, since the player makes these decisions, he or she can't be surprised by them. This flaw will be mitigated by the modules that are delivered by MCG.

Third, the rules aren't easy to learn, the rulebook isn't a masterpiece even in its 2.0 incarnation.

All in all, this works well for me, and future expansions might raise the rating. But I can understand people who feel put on.

This game is a bit rough around the edges. A pitty, because it's got top notch components and lovely gameplay.

Though it is "a toolkit game" as some say, that can work great for some groups/solo players.

If you are a flexible player liberated enough to play to the soul of a game and not only the rules, Myth is perhaps the most exciting co-op dungeon crawl there is. I can understand those who refer to a rule book to check any uncertainty not liking Myth, but Myth is a sand-box game that intends for players to make decisions about all aspects of the game and game play.  This fits my game style like a glove, so as far as I am concerned,gaming can't get much better than Myth

This is an amazing game to start with. 

There are some quirks in the rulebook, yes indeed, but this is being worked on, and there is a revised set already available in the free "Fury of the Fireborn" expansion download. 
In addition to that the creators did publish erratas, new version of cards as well as some instruction videos to overcome these challenges. 

From my personal perspective the game is a mixture of a board game and a tabletop game with some RPG aspects. If you have some background in roleplaying (either computer or the classic D&D), you will absolutely love this game, as it gives you the freedom of choice how you want to play this game. You need to decide some things for yourself, the game does not take away decisions from you. You need to decide per tile e.g. if and which warbands shall appear, or of how many enemies those consist. 

In addition the game really plays differently for each of the 5 characters, because they are associated with a deck of 25 substantially different cards per character. People knowing the classic RPG archetypes will instantly feel at home and also have an understanding what the strategies per character are. 

There are several quests and quest chains which are more defined, which you can play along, but the game really shines when you are making up a story yourself and decide on what happens exactly! 

I am loving this game.

The gameplay isn't bad.  It reminds me a lot of Diablo since you'll be destroying hordes of baddies each turn.  However I have a few personal complaints about the game that I'm sure many other people may disagree with but these reasons are why I decided to remove the game from my collection. In no particular order they are:

1. This game has a lot of KS exclusive content. I didn't get in on the KS so I don't have any of that stuff but the base game still comes with some of the elements of the exclusives. It's pretty annoying having those parts but not being able to play with them since you don't have the rest of it.

2. It's an open-world game but to me I felt like it lacks direction story wise.  I felt like I was constantly slaying baddies but there was no consistent story-line or reasoning behind this.

3.  It's an incomplete game.  The base game only takes your character so far and if you want to continue growing your character you will have to follow Myth and purchase all of their games and add-on content for several years to come.  That's a major turnoff for me as I want to be able to have a full, complete experience of a game when I buy it.  Not just part of the experience.

Anyway those are my reasons why I decided to quit Myth.

Myth is among the most polarising games on BGG. If you're skimming the comments, as of 1st Feb 2015, let me explain why.

I have a retail copy of this game, and it's probably the best and most innovative cooperative social dungeon crawl I've ever played. It's like a casual RPG without a GM, in which players choose - to some extent - the quest/mission they want to undertake and then battle the baddies.

The alpha player problem is tackled by the multiple character decks and each turn is a cooperative puzzle as you work out how to use your available cards and action points. One player can't decide to go it alone, because they'll use the group's action points and trigger the darkness.

The game length is configurable and it avoids many of the other issues of old-school dungeon crawls such as excessive dice rolling and uncontrollable luck. It's simply a better game, mechanically, than Shadows of Brimstone.

Unfortunately, the game has many rules ambiguities, confusing cards (out of the box) and user-configurable difficulty. Monster movement rules, for example, rely on the common sense of the players. Some players HATE the learning curve and can't deal with rules ambiguity. These players see Myth as broken out of the box. And, yes, if you're a rules lawyer - or have one in your group - you won't enjoy this game at all.

If you're someone who is happy to say 'well, if I were the monsters I'd probably spawn on the square behind the heroes as they've just killed my mates', Myth is entirely playable. Likewise if you enjoy complex miniatures games, RPGs or other titles that require small amounts of preparation before your first game.

As the Myth system develops, it's likely that the game will become more *accessible* to the mass of board gamers. By this point, it may be the best cooperative dungeon crawl ever created - better even than Warhammer Quest.

Game is loads of fun. Yes, the instructions can be a bit vague on some things; but I found the videos at the megacon site were very helpful. Also, there are many forums here that helped as well. I enjoy the game because it plays so different then most games I have played. It is like a touch of DnD type play but your the DM as well....and I think it does it pretty good at this...while keeping the flow interesting. I really do hope this IP does not die and that we see more. I love the fan base for this game...in that people have come up with various ways of playing it.  Only thing I do is change up the progression between acts (play sessions)...in that my characters keep what they got. I would reset if the players and I wanted to go for a new flow.  I would restart though at the start of modules depending on how they flow....but still waiting for most of the those. :)

RATING: N/A
Dungeon crawl RPG modular board, ability cards, and special dice. Thankfully, Myth does not use rigidly defined scenarios BUT you have to be prepared for "on-the-fly" DM'ing to flesh out the encounters at startup and as it unfolds. Slaughterhouse mode is a riot. Serendipity level, threat levels (which I like), interrupt reactions, make for a very labored play through with lots of rule referencing. I don't necessarily mind that because it is a complex system and it would take a while to get familiar with it. But, this one does not replace my paper and pencil RPG either.

The lack of a "How to Play" Guide is a killer for this game, along with a rule book that is a hot mess.  Once they provide a real rule book this rating will change I hope.

Rating based off 4 games now - have not gotten into the campaign system.  

Extremely deep game that is very satisfying once you get going with it.  However, it is very fiddly and quite difficult to learn if you aren't watching someone else play it first.  Rulebook is scattershot and missing things I got in the demo game I played last year.

The depth of the game is sadly its weakest point with our group, I don't think I can pull this out randomly and bring people up to speed for a one night session once a month.

The game has solid components, great artwork, and is highly, highly customizable--if you can figure out how to play it. The Kickstarter version I have came with an incomplete rule book. Trying to fill in the blanks requires a lot of reading on BGG forums, and supplemental material on the Myth website (that also has typos and incorrect information!!!). 

And then there is an issue of not feeling like a complete board game experience.  The game has 4 monster types included, minion, captain, mini-boss, and boss.  The mini-boss is an undead but there are no other undead included in the game.  This wouldn't be so much of an issue if two of the mini-bosses special abilities that make him tougher to fight require undead figures...  

Included in the game are uncomplete chains of quests.  You get on your card a mention to draw another card. But no such card exists in the game. Other cards reference classes that aren't included in the game, other special abilities which I can find no other reference to.  And then there's the idea that almost 40% of the bad guys in the box do a poison ability that isn't even mentioned in the box what that is, or what it does.  

So there are a lot of missing elements to it which you can easily find frustrating in your opening game sessions.  I've played about 5 games at this point which have involved heavy amounts of rule searching.  

It also lacks any helpful information for starting your first game. Some of the card texts are also have some teeth-grinding grammatical issues which make the card confusing, or include texts or icons on them that are misleading, confusing, or inconsistent.  For example, there's a movement card in the game that says you can't move to use it!?!

If it weren't for BGG, I wouldn't know how to handle some of the missing elements. That being said, the game is entertaining when played semi-correctly. But it's hard to achieve some satisfaction that you're actually playing the game correctly.  I can see lots of hours being spent on this game, but as of right now, in it's current condition, I don't want to take it to group gaming sessions. There's too much ambiguity in the current cards and rules.  And I can think of a dozen different games I'd rather play. 

Hopefully, when the updated rule book comes out, it won't lack the substance the Kickstarter rule book does.

Damn this game's hot! I thought the minis looked cool in pictures, but they are outstanding in person. I love the quality, they can take a beating, and still are very detailed, and cool as heck!

The gameplay is fun, I had no trouble understanding the v2.0 rules. This is a game I see myself exploring in extreme depth.

Card Sleeves info:

Large cards = Poker size. I use Swan Panasia 65x90mm.
Small cards = Mini European size (44x68). I use the 45x70mm Swan Panasia Thin Sleeves, and they fit very well.

Horrible rulebook
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There are some fiddly bits with the rulebook that prevent this game getting a higher score with me, but actual gameplay has been very enjoyable with excellent replayability.
[update] revising to a 9.5 after the 1.1 rules resulted in an 8 hour marathon play session.  We didn't want to stop playing - the 1.1 rules update really fixed the 'fiddly bits' that made me mark it down before.  Well done!

UPDATE:
Revising to an 8, very disappointed with 2.0 version of the rules, they should have left well enough alone. Still a beautiful game.

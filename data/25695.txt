A dexterity game, you have to be in the mood and not have one person used to eat chinese food with chopstick, or they really have an advantage. In my games, I was that person.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pure dexterity game requiring good reflexes and dexterity, but little thinking required.  Need to play with opponents who don't mind very direct competition and scrambling for the pieces in the bowl.  With the wrong crowd, this can get very very physical.  This would be one of the last games that I let a group of boys to play, but it is safer than Lawn Darts.  You can expand this game to 4 with a small bowl, and an extra set of chopsticks, but I think that the gameplay gets too physical loses some elegance.  It can become crowded with too much emphasis on brute force as you just try to hammer someone else's chopsticks to keep them from picking one of the last few pieces.  Best with 3

Here's how to play this game with kids who can't use chopsticks (grownups too, I guess). Turn the chopsticks into giant tweezers by tying a rubber band really tight at the back end and inserting a small folded up piece of paper right next to the rubber band to act as a fulcrum.

This was really a lot of fun to play. Now in all fairness, my roommate has a little more skil with chopsticks than I do but man oh man, did we have fun. I made up for my lack of chopstick skill by just constantly knocking the piece out of his chopsticks. Final score: 15 to 8. Now I have to find someone who has never used chopsticks and beat them mercilessly!!! 2nd game w/GF: I won 10-6. I think playing to 10 is better, especially with people not accustomed to using chopsticks. Next up: solo variant.

Man, I laughed so hard playing this one.  Being able to poke at people's sticks and pull the bowl your way made for an interesting battle of trying to pick up bits with sticks.  I'm glad we gave this one a shot as now I found a game that I plan on playing more.  So far, Pair-of-Dice games are two for two with me.

This was [i]the[/i] hit of Protospiel 2006 for me. Lots of laughs and "friendly" competition. I've played several times since then with friends and family, and it's still at the top of my list for quick dexterity games. The plastic chopsticks from the Mayday edition are very slippery and therefore a lot more challenging than standard chopsticks, and the onigiri are not easy to pick up in any case.

Very fun dex game - you can't help but laugh!  My 6 y.o. daughter thought this was a riot (we modified the chopsticks with a rubber band and small lego piece as a fulcrum - thanks for the idea, Big Kat!).  This one's a keeper -- we may have to re-dye or paint the pieces, though, because they are VERY faded.

Raptorlolz. This game is hilarious. Kudos to the designer for coming up with this and actually publishing it. It's a great filler to bust out when you have new players that have not played it.

The better you are at using chopsticks, the less enjoyable this game becomes. However, having multiple players who are at more or less the same skill level is grounds for hilarity. 

Also, the rules state that you shouldn't directly attack another player's chopsticks. Screw that. It's way more fun to use the chopsticks as little swords in the bowl of battle.

One of the most wild and exciting dexterity games out there!  Players need to have similar skill with chopsticks, but you can give a bit of a handicap by letting the beginner "choke up" closer to the tips.  The full game can go a little long, but it is easy to just choose a number of rounds or winning score at the start.  Few games produce so much laughter (optionally seasoned with choice language).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I'm good with chopsticks. It's not uncommon I get all points.  People switching their strategy to "knock the pieces out of my sticks" is common practice.

This isn't a game. It's a toy.  Which can be fun.  But as a dexterity game: worst ever, because even a tiny bit of skill difference ruins the game.

I had the opportunity to play the brand new edition of this twice at a game day last Saturday. 

I was very skeptical but after playing a round with two friends and laughing a lot the whole time, I had to play again.

The second play was with a different friend and his son, who we had to teach to use chopsticks. It was even more fun and more funny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Look at the name of the game, look at the pictures, and you already know how to play.  Each round, you're going for specific colors or shapes of wooden doo-dads, quickly trying to move them from the central bowl to your own bowl.  Your opponents are trying to do the same thing, and they're also allowed to parry, chop, and grab at your chopsticks with their own.  It's half dexterity game, half martial arts.  And it's a blast in the right situation.

Pretty funny. But my hand cramped up quickly, and while getting things with chopsticks quickly is interesting, fighting over items isn't (but is the funny part).

Not a huge dex game fan.  But, this is amusing.  Maybe it's because I can somewhat use chopsticks and many can't.  Only thing is.  The game says 2-3, but in a 3 player one person is always sitting out, so it really seems to be more like a two player game.

More of a toy than an actual game, but addictively fun!  A more skilled chopstick user will probably beat out the competition, but it's still fun to jostle for the right pieces.  The game can get quite vicious!  A minor complaint about the components - the pieces came with the paint already quite heavily faded, and it can be hard to tell some of the colors apart.  But this is quite fun in small doses, definitely a unique idea.

Update: 2/11/10 - Have to revise my rating.  There are few games that provide more fun in a shorter time span - with the right people it is hilarious.  Today we were scrambling on the floor over the last piece.  Up to a 9.

Also, the publisher replaced my pieces with ones that are more colored and very easy to tell apart, greatly improving playability.  Everyone should own this game!

Fun Filler! A fun dexterity challenge for people that like to play with their chopsticks! The components are really nice...there are quite a few stickers to stick initially...but that's ok! As a party game it is pretty good! But because it only supports 3 players...an odd gaming number of players...it's not really great! It has it's funny moments, but I wouldn't say it's a hilariously good time! I still enjoy playing it and I think maybe it shines best as a 2-player experience over anything else!

RATING: N/A
This game is a lot of fun.  There are five objects to a set (flat circle, flat star, cube, flat heart and a very small bobbin).  There are five sets to a game with each set being a different color (blue, green, purple, red and yellow) for a total of twenty-five objects.  The goal is to win the most tokans.  This is done by someone flipping a tokan, for example a tokan with a picture of a green cube.  Prior to play eveyone's chopsticks are to be touching the table.  The tokan is flipped and everyone trys to pull out items matching either the color or the shape.  The player with the most objects wins the tokan.  The piece matching the tokan is the tie breaker.  Play continues until all the tokans have been won.  The player with the most tokans at the end does a final timed round to be crowned Chopstick Dexterity MegaChallenge 3000 Champion.  We play until our hands cramp.  Your hands will cramp if you are not used to using chopsticks.  We love this game.  I think some home ground rules may need to be established to make it a safe fun game or else chopsticks may fly.

This is a great game (at least for those with at least passable chopstick dexterity).  However, it feels like it has too few items for true replay value.  I enjoyed this game, but I felt like I wanted more.  This feels like the version designed for people without chopstick dexterity.  This feels like Chopstick Dexterity Challenge.  I'd have settled for Chopstick Dexterity MegaChallenge, or even Chapstick Dexterity MegaChallenge 2000, but this game isn't worthy of its lofty title.

Exactly what you'd expect from a dexterity game using chopsticks.  Exactly.  No more.  No less.

There is nothing original about the design of the game beyond the decision to use chopsticks.  It's pleasing, functional, and amusing on occasion.  However, it gets boring pretty quickly since there are no twists, choices, or cleverness -- just be the fastest and don't drop the pieces.

Even though the back story for the game is pure parody, it really is a good way to get kids to practice with chopsticks!

An incredibly simple dexterity game.  You have chopsticks and you have to pick out a piece in the bowl before your opponent.

Silly fun with chopsticks! Each round, a random scoring chip is displayed: race to collect whatever is on it (25 wooden bits in 5 colors and 5 shapes are in a bowl in the center of the table). Whoever does so gets the chip; the first player to x chips wins!

Great fun as a quick filler, though the game can run a bit long when playing to 10 points.  I prefer playing to 5 to pass time between games or some such thing.

It is also problematic in terms of play balance... because I'm *very adept* with chopsticks, and none of my friends come close to my level of experience with them.

This game is a ton of fun. My 6 year old son and I had a really fun time, and I can imagine a bunch of adults giggling through it too.

Great dexterity game!  Components are high quality.  It's a blast to play.  Easy to learn.  Great value for the money.

Played 3+ times. This is a riot.  Absolutely insane.  I think it would probably unfairly bias non-chopstick users, but it is just crazy...  I wish I owned this. 2007/11/25

Hilarity ensues! A different sort of dexterity game that is way fun.

Silly speed game that takes about 2 seconds for loved ones to yell "no, that's mine" and attack their chopsticks with their own while a 3rd player just causually goes for another item.  Components are amazing and the game is just plain fun.

Fun the first few times around.  Not quite sure about replayability, but it's certainly fun and crazy.   Rating based on two plays.

Gets a little rating bump based on novelty and wild game play.

This is a very silly game, but it's a surprisingly good very silly game. Expect a frenetic directly competitive dexterity game with relatively few injuries. Worth trying to hunt down a copy.

As you can no doubt imagine from the title, this is a very silly dexterity game where two to three players face off by simultaneously trying to grab small wooden bits from a common bowl using chopsticks and try to transport them to your own private bowl. A certain shape and color of pieces is randomly determined each round as the target, and then it's a no holds barred chopsticks match, which can get pretty vicious. It works surprisingly well as a game, as long as no one player is significantly more of a chopsticks expert than the other players, in which case you can definitely expect a route, since a catch-up mechanic this game certainly doesn't have.

(I wish it came in a real "game box" instead of a cheap plastic package since I am a sucker for those things.)

How can a game where you try to grab stuff with chopsticks not be fun?

Thank you Secret Santa

This game now resides I think in the hands of the Stockholm District of the Federation of Gameclubs. It still is a good game, I just could not room it in all my moves to small living spaces.

I will admit that this game is wacky fun, exciting, and both easy to understand + quick to play. My problem is that a) I am not good with chopsticks so I do not stand much of a chance, b) I am very uncomfortable being aggressive or assertive. Basically, when other players are really "into" it, I will just sit back and let them play since I know my odds are low and, more importantly, I do not like fighting with others or being in the middle of action. Since there is a small space for so many chopsticks, I would rather not be a part of it. But not a bad game.

First played at Protospiel 2006, this is perhaps my favorite dexterity game. As we played, we developed several strategies which I should write up in a strategy guide. The rules are "I-wish-I'd-thought-of -that!" simple, but it's truly a fun game, and a good way to get your adrenaline pumping. (Please note, I did a piece of art for this one.)

What a fun, tense manual dexterity game - the genius of the game is it's sheer simplicity. Grab colored shapes from the central bowl as fast as you can, and place them in the small bowl in front of you, all using your chopsticks. Works great with 2-3 players so long as everyone is roughly equal in skill with a pair of chopsticks. Greg also came up with a very, very clever solo game to hone your "chops" so to speak. Quite impressed.

Crazy dexterity game with good components. Sadly the demo monkeys at Mayday's booth at SPIEL 2014 didn't know the rules too well, and didn't have answers to what happens if the bowl is knocked over, or pieces knocked out of it, or even if you were allowed to use the sticks as swords to swat pieces out of other players' grasp.

2014 version. Colorblind partner vetoed playing before we could start a game due to bowl color blending with pieces.

Wow is this some silly fun.  Perhaps bordering on activity more than a game... with the right one or to other people there is an amazing amount of laughing and cursing as you try to grab those slippery pieces with your slippery chopsticks.  A fun fast different filler.  Worth a play at least and an easy recommend to just go out and buy if you like chopsticks and laughing.

A pretty good game if all players are at the same dexterity level, but if not the game will be horribly uneven.

Players make frenetic use and abuse of chopsticks to acquire matching shapes and/or colors from a central bowl; however, dirty play is wholly encouraged!  In all my years of using chopsticks, playing this game is the first time my hand cramped from using chopsticks.  Madness!

After 1 Play: I'd been wanting to try this for years and finally got the chance. A ton of fun, but I think it'd be really easy to overplay. One or two plays a year seems about right.

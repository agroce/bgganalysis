I've gone off pure euros lately but this is by far one of the better ones in recent time. Some innovative mechanics which insinuate a more strategic game but deep down it's purely tactical as reacting to the dice is more important than trying to do any longer turn planning. Really good though and rating may rise.

Roll a fistful of dice, which are then used to allocate action cubes for future actions (choose fewer cubes for earlier actions or more cubes for later actions).  Use these cubes to do the following: 1) move your ship (this takes a long time initially but is worth the investment as shipping goods is a major way to score points), 2) build ability cards (you need to get these built anyways as they score you minus points if they're not built over the course of the game), 3) move ahead on the turn order track (yes it's always good to go first), 4) take over a city quarter (this gets you the requisite goods to ship, and also scores some points at game end), and 5) discard cubes for money (if you have the appropriate cards built).  Money is exclusively used to purchase points, and because it is scarce and the points you can purchase are significant, you'll want a way to get some income.

I was initially quite turned off by this game, as it seemed like a real grind, and a luckfest.  Further plays have shown that there is some real depth and replayability (and it plays great as a 2er).  The dice can be frustrating at times.

I've played it just one time, but really enjoyed it. Many original feelings to this game - especially around the supply of cubes which turned out to be bright and challenging, but not overly taxing on the brain. The theme hardly helps here, but the mechanics are so well executed, it doesn't matter too much. Very enjoyable game that certainly deserves a place at the top of any collection.

Otro gran juego de Feld, con reglas sumamente sencillas, es un juego donde tienes pensar y planificar muchísimo a la larga, en ese aspecto, mucho más que otros juegos suyos relacionados: el año del dragón, die burguen... siendo de  dureza similar. Feld como siempre, muy euro puro = pensar = temática semi-abstracta. Se juega  rápido, en este caso sí se acerca a los 90 min que reza la caja, dependiendo de jugadores, y se hace ameno, ya que las fases 1 y 2 de las 3 de cada ronda, se hacen casi simultáneas. Falta probarlo más.

Macao is a game where if you do not have a plan, than you are planning to fail. Also, luck helps. This is definitely one of my favorite Felds. Not because the currency abreviation is "PP" either. While hilarious, APs, PPs, etc are probably the only horrible part of this game. The art is also not why I like this game so much because well... it isn't anything to write home about. No this is one of my favorites because it is just a great game. There are a lot of moving parts in Macao but they all come together in a synergistic way. These parts include dice rolls to create a pool of colored cubes used for actions, two boards, cards, and a rondal that drives a color coded cube action allowance system to keep the game in motion. The two boards consist of one that is primarily about pick up and deliver and the other about area control and set collection. You must progress on one in order for the other to matter. The card flops and drafting every round force you to make choices as to what cards and associated powers you THINK you will be able to purchase down the line using specific combinations of cubes. These cubes were placed by you on a rondal that determines what cubes are going to be avilable to you on what round. The rondal drives the game, the cubes fuel the rondal, you steer the game using the rondal. If you fail to plan and guide your specific actions and choices accordingly, then things start going wrong. Horribly horribly wrong. Cards add up and suddenly you are taking negative points for cards you drafted that you cannot purchase using the proper combination of cubes. Ships stop being able to move to locations or are not loaded with the proper cargo to get you any points because you didn't have the right cubes to purchase the right districts and carge which means you lose influence on key districts and thus end game points. Finally, Stefan Feld comes by hosts a comedy central roast in your honor where all of your friends take turns pointing out your shortcomings (ok not the last part). Truly Macao is magnificent and reminicent of other Felds that punish you for bad choices or just bad luck like Notre Dam. Highly recommended by me. Especially if S&M is your kind of kink.

Abstract: 
An innovative euro game by Stefan Feld. Each player has a Windrose - a septemgonal board numbered from 1 to 6 plus one arrow symbol - to collect colored cubes. Players get contract cards which they have to fulfill by spending colored cubes. Fulfilled contracts grant special abilities. There is also a central board which is split into a shipping area (race game) and a district area (set collection / area control).

Round overview:
a) reveal contract cards 
b) determine exchange value for prestige (victory) points
c) each player takes one contract (in player order)
d) colored dice are rolled to determine where and how much colored cubes can be placed at the Windrose 
e) each player choose 2 dice and places the matching cubes at his Windrose
f) all Windroses are turned one spot to the right
g) players can use cubes at the arrow symbol spot of the Windrose for different actions

Actions (mostly activated by spending cubes):
a) activate (fulfill) contracts by spending the required cubes
b) move ship to deliver collected trade goods
c) move forward on the track for player order (wall track)
d) claim a district in the city and collect a good tile
e) exchange prestige points for money (once per round, only money needed)
f) use special abilities from activated contracts

Pros:
+ Innovative and challenging Windrose mechanic
+ Multi-used dice which determine the type (color) and quantity of resources, and the round on which they can be used
+ A big number of different contracts with special abilities (only half of them are used each game)
+ Lot of special abilities and combinations (engine-building, set-collection, different strategies)
+ Set collection for good tiles which is also used for area control in the city. On top of that, players have to keep an eye on the shipping routes to ship the collected good in a efficient way
+ There a few joker/wild tiles in the city which can be collected instead of good tiles. The joker tiles grant either a free cube or 3 money which adds more flexibility especially when activating the difficult contracts
+ Competition for being first player (wall track). Having first dips on the newly revealed cards is a big advantage
+ Penalty if you have too many contracts creates tension
+ Variable exchange rate for prestige points: a bit push your luck
+ Interesting mix between long-time planning and make the best of the current situation
+ Plays well with all player counts but differently (less competitive with 2 players since there is more space and tiles)
+ Helpful player aid integrated on player boards (but formatting and small font make it a bit hard to scan)

Neutrals:
# Indirect player interaction: be first to collect and trade goods, first choice on contracts, area-control for districts
# Some luck and randomness: dice rolls, revealed contract cards, and good tiles distribution
# Sometimes a player might be multiple times lucky or unlucky regarding rolled dice or revealed cards (luck of draw)
# There are over 120 contract cards and players get only a few which makes it very difficult or even unlikely to collect the right combination of cards (being first player helps)
# ... despite all luck and randomness: the game is all about mitigating luck and randomness by planning ahead and making sure to keep one's options open
# Can be unforgiving if not planning ahead smartly (especially on the first game)
# No hidden information (still enough randomness to prevent analysis paralysis)
# Very strategical in terms of picking the right contract cards or dice
# Sometimes tactical to get a trade good before someone else does or to avoid negative points
# Some rounds feel less productive if a player has only a few cubes (but there are also some super big turns)
# Moving ships to the first harbor feels very slowly (come on, get there in time!!)
# There are a lot of components (300 cubes!) but it does not feel fiddly
# May have some down-times (especially on higher player counts): each player does all actions at once (not turn by turn)
# Scoring may happen during the round and at the end of the game - scoring points happens not as often as in other games by Stefan Feld

Cons:
- Theme and artwork is okay, but dry and not very strong
- Challenging to get into the system on the first game
- Leftover money is useless at the end of the game (counts no prestige points)
- Subtle wording for how often a contract card can be used. Should have been clearly highlighted on the cards
- Rules are okay but icons on cards and goods are not properly introduced (pictures would help), moreover, the limited usage of cards and actions is not clearly explained

Thoughts:
I love the pure, unique design of Macao. It has many intertwined mechanics but still does not feel overwhelming like other games with similar complexity and crunchiness. Macao, like Bruges, is all about mitigating luck and creating an engine by clever planning. However, not all players will like the Windrose mechanic which is not that intuitive kind of a puzzle.

Similar games: 
* Bruges (like Macao all about luck-mitigation, more tactical, overall lighter game, easier to teach and play)

This game is very complex.  The wind rose mechanic is nice and fresh.  I'm thinking this game needs a catchup mechanism, or at least hide some part of the score.  It felt like you could get behind and end up in trouble.

Lots of moving parts, a good game overall.

One of the best Feld games I played. There is punishment in points for not being able to do things or store cards, so you have to plan a lot ahead. This game reminds me of Tzolk'in in the meaning of planning a lot ahead, of course the games are very different in mechanics and theme, so the comparison is just because of the way you plan your rounds.

RATING: 5
Eh.  The look-ahead is too far; the cards are poorly balanced, in that some help to the key VP gaining methods, while others help your engine, but most engines here are going to be wobbly.  There is some cool stuff here, but it doesn't quite work out.

Really irrelevant starting player mechanism here, where the incentive is fairly weak at least 2p.

From what I had read of Macao, I was expecting to be profoundly disappointed with it, as I was with the only two other Stefan Feld games I have played (Rum&Pirates and Notre Dame). Macao has turned out to be an unbelievably pleasant surprise for me!
I am SHOCKED (SHOCKED, I say!) to hear people describe Macao as a tactical game! Certainly, an element of tactical thinking is required, but in reality, this is the Mother of All Long Term Strategic Planning Games! And that is due to the unique die roll-compass thingy. As far as long term strategy goes, I don't think I've played any other game that has such a plethora of options to be puzzled with. And such planning is not a dry exercise at all, due to the modicum of luck in the game that generates a deliciously agonizing uncertainty for players. I suspect that anyone who plays Macao as a tactical game would, indeed, find it to be dry and luck driven; but such illusions will fade away if you play while looking at the BIG strategic picture, and not focus merely on the round at hand. Luck driven it ain't, by ANY stretch of the imagination!
Nevertheless, there are a few problems with the game. The final stretch of the game is lacking in the delightful tension of the first two thirds of Macao, since the players have much fewer action points to work with by that point. Secondly, the only player interaction in the game lies in keeping an eye on what the other guy is up to; that's not a critical fault, but it's there. Thirdly, those who delight in analysis paralysis will be in Heaven with Macao: therefore, consider yourself warned!
Fourthly and finally, there is the question of theme. I am SHOCKED (SHOCKED, I say!) to hear people say that Macao is lacking in theme! Why, there's theme pasted all over the place in Macao! Theme that (sadly) has next to nothing to do with the game mechanics. Normally, a lack of theme can ruin a game for me, but not Macao. The game system is just too brilliant for me to be deterred by such petty things as theme!
Macao is beautiful! Brains a'smokin'!

The box front says: "An exciting strategy game for clever captains and wise governors." That just about sums it up. It's a tactical gambling game, not so much strategy, but...
... it is much more strategic than people make it out to be. If you want less luck with the cards, check out my thread: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/501824/the-macao-thread-for-discussing-variants-on-cards
I think the gambling is sort of fun. Best if your thinking about playing the other players, and not into the game itself.
It's not very deep, sure. I think that's what prevents me from playing it. But I have fun when I play it!

UPDATE: Really curious to play this one again after "rediscovering" it through my geekbuddy comments.

All the bits and pieces of Macao's design strike me as 'clever'... but I didn't particularly like them. Possibly one of the most dry, abstracted Euros I've ever touched. The cubes are literally just action cubes. Not resources. Certainly at least an average Euro, but the tension of building up an engine that's always on the precipice of negative points was really just a little bit annoying to me--especially when the actions were somewhat boring. Eh.

Tough decisions again in a Feld game. The quality of the components could have been better and prettier... Many people find that game a bit hard but I don't think so. I think it's on the light-medium side and it can be taught to many people as an entry level to more medium-heavy games.

UPDATE: Hmm ... I'm not saying it's wet (as in, not dry), but it feels fun and the dice / AP mechanism is great. Like, really great. Picks up speed greatly at the end and though early on it feels like you're not going to be able to do anything, by the final rounds you've shipped bunches of good, have a nice network set up, and have a strong tableau. The punishment element is nice also. All in all, a very fun game that won't burn your whole night.

--------------------------------------------------------

Sure, it's dry as dust, but the mechanism in the game is interesting and there are so many things to do and so many factors to consider.  Not as brutally punishing as "In the Year of the Dragon", but punishing and legitimately interesting decisions.

Tricky resource management game where you collect cubes to perform actions, needing to balance between taking goods and spots in the town, building offices and buildings which give you special abilities, moving your ship so you can sell goods, gaining money for victory points and moving along the turn order track.  A really interesting challenge.

Good risk management game. Lots of things to do with your resources. There is competition for the districts, for the turn order and you must move your ship quickly to get full points. In the mean time there is pressure to build your cards in order to avoid getting negative points. The use of dice and the windrose is quite innovative. Includes a lot of cards for replayability and combos. Which cards will turn up is partially random so turn order is crucial if you want to get a good card or one that you can actually build!

This is an excellent game, and probably Feld's best that I've played (so far), which includes the likes of Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon.  There are some very interesting, innovative mechanics, and these are coupled with well-balanced game play that affords multiple paths to victory.  What's more, there are 96 unique Building/Person cards that give the game seemingly endless replay value. I will say that the rule book needs a lot of improvement--it might be the worst I've ever dealt with in terms of grammatical mistakes (thankfully not in terms of rule ambiguities, which are much more important).  It even includes this corny admonishment at the end regarding how players shouldn't try to manipulate rules to their advantage (very cheesy).

Update after further play:
I do not personally feel that I am one who typically suffers from AP (I do not, for example, suffer from it with respect to many games that are known for it--e.g. Tikal and Le Havre).  However, Macao is a notable exception.  There is just so much to consider in every facet of the game, and the diverse array of cards, while adding almost infinite replayability, only exacerbate the AP problem.  While it is true that many of Feld's games contain ample intricacies and things to consider (or else you'll get "punished" severely), it seems especially palpable with Macao.  For this reason, I'm downgrading Macao, placing it behind Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon.  A great game, but not as good as these two because of the AP issue...

A really good game, with a very pleasing and fun combination of interesting and creative mechanics. The designer (Stefan Feld) has managed to make the rolling of dice, and the "gamer's desire to plan ahead on turns," fun in a very mellow and interesting way. 

Other nice touches include...lots of nicely colored cubes to accumulate and spend (without having to worry about what they represent...interesting), and a pleasing game board to look at.

Although this game uses materials we are all familiar with cubes, cards, dice and resources, it manages to feel, through the magic of capable game design, original and refreshing. Admittedly, confusing card terminology and card effects do present some challenges for first time Macao gamers, but all in all, Macao feels like the ideal game to give a friend and/or family that likes euros.

RATING: 7
Another game which "uses dice in an interesting way".

Here the major mechanic is that the dice selected give a person a respective number of action cubes (kind of similar to action points) and that these action cubes become available to a person according to the value of the die he gets.  For example, choose a '6' value die to get 6 action cubes which will become available in 6 turns (5 rounds), choose a '1' value die to get 1 action cube to become available within that 1 turn (the current round), etc.

This mechanic creates a number of interesting dynamics.  Chief among them being how you weigh between getting some action cubes sooner or a lot of action cubes later.  These cubes then allow for a number of different options, giving players the ability to pursue different yet equally rewarding strategies.  Overall the mechanics are very intuitive and mesh well with one another.

However while I find the mechanics in Macao to be refreshing and interesting, I find the components to be very lackluster.  The tiles and cards are all thin (feels thinner than Catan tiles) and the tiles are cut awkwardly (such as the gold coins being circular in picture but not really cut in a way to make them feel like coins).

But despite these component issues, Macao is a another great example of how dice can be used and plays relatively quick for the amount of depth it presents.

The wheel mechanic is interesting. There are muliple paths to victory, it is a clever game with lots to think about, the use of cards keeps it from becoming same-y, it conatins lots of wooden cubes which you end up refering to as colours"give me some red and two grey" all in all it's another fine euro cube pusher which I'm sure I've played before in other incarnations.

This is a solid game that features 2 elements that I enjoy.  First there is an area control / connection element in the warehouses that are claimed.  Second is the multiple combination effects that can be combined for effects.  This starts with the windmill and cube acquisitions and continues straight through to the scoring.  There are many elements to this game and many great things about it.  The replay factor is very high with the very limited (versus supplied) cards that can come into play during a game.  That said, that is also one of the draw backs.  Since there are so many possible cards, it is very difficult to plan for one to come up - and that means the outcome can swing based on who happens to be in a position to seize an opportunity.  All in all, its one of the strongest Alea titles in a while.

But it burden with two problems: first, it feel arbitrarily punishing (losing three points for not having any action cubes seems okay, but why can't I have more than five cards?). Second, as one guy who played with me pointed out, shipping seems to provide most of the points, making the rest of the game irrelevant.

Buen juego de Feld. Ese mecanismo de preparar los turnos futuros con adelanto tiene una sabor a Tzolkien pero en este caso me parece más gestionable. Me gusta la aleatoriedad de las cartas porque hace que el juego sea muy rejugable. Y la temática es agradable de jugar. 
Me gusta. No noto que sea un multi-juegos sino que veo que está bien relacionado todo, el tema, las mecánicas y el funcionamiento del turno.
Se juega rápido, se viven los turnos de los compis y la interacción es máxima.
Me chirría la sola posibiliad de comprar una vez por turno tanto terrenos como puntos. Es algo que no interiorizo bien pero entiendo que en el juego funciona.
Me gusta, la verdad. No le diría que no.

Well, maybe over-developed - there are too many cards (which would have benefitted from a little pruning), some of which are helpful only if you own other specific cards and can tilt the game unsatisifyingly.  The 'rondel' dice/cube distribution is an idea of genius, which makes the game.  A 'typical' Alea/Stefan Brück style game.

Copy is in good condition and the box has minimal shelf-wear. This is the 2009 Rio Grande Edition. The only negative is that the original manual had water damage on it (making the first three pages unreadable) when it was traded to me. I printed out a black and white replacement manual with a laser printer.

Ejha! Ez tetszett! Díjazom az egyedi megoldásokat, és az a korongos ötlet szerintem a legegyedibb kockás mechanizmus az általam ismertek közül. Ha már kockák, szerintem ez a játék veri simán a Kingsburgot, de talán a Troyes-t is. 
Ami még tetszett, az a fajta pontszerzési mód, ami a kártyákra írt számok alapján egyfajta random módon van meghatározva, így körről körre más ár-érték arányú lehet.
Jó a játékban, hogy nem tud kárba veszni kocka, mert ha más nem, a falon, vagy a tengerben el tudjuk használni.

Túl sok a kártya... Ez ront a játékélményen, elég a saját csomó kártyámat figyelni, esélytelen, hogy a többiekét is végig észben tartsam.

Átpontoztam a Feldeket, csak 3 db 8 pontost hagytam: Burgund, Dragon, Notre Dame. A Burgundba nem nagyon tudok belekötni, de a másik kettő az, amivel legszívesebben játszom.

To play well, this is a real brain burner with the windrose future income predictions. Wow, my head hurts! Maybe I'm trying to be too efficient.

I'm determined to try and use my income for other things rather than just buying buildings. Although to not have buildings at the end is a bonus.

I saw Ron win by getting his ship moving and delivering thigns first.

I especially love the multiple paths to Prestige in this game.. from outright buying them, to bonuses, to selling goods, to occupying the city. excellent mix!!

Ο Feld είναι αγαπημένος. Ο Feld έχει φτιάξει παιχνιδάρες. Ο Feld δεν είναι τέλειος, κάνει και κείνος λάθη. Πχ, το Macao.

Στο Macao δεν αρκεί να είσαι προγραμματιστής, ούτε οργανωτής event, ούτε μετεωρολόγος για να μπορέσεις να προβλέψεις και να τοποθετήσεις τα κυβάκια του σωστού χρώματος στο σωστό ζάρι, ώστε μετά από 398252375 γύρους να τα πάρεις πίσω για να ενεργοποιήσεις την κάρτα που ήθελες να έχεις από τον 3ο γύρο και που τώρα σου είναι άχρηστη γιατί δεν μπορείς να αξιοποιήσεις τις ιδιότητές της, αφού ο γύρος πέρασε και είσαι σχεδόν στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού και θα φας και μείον γιατί δεν έχεις χτίσει τις άλλες 9237523875 κάρτες που υποχρεωτικά πρέπει να πάρεις στο προσωπικό ταμπλό σου. Και μέσα σε όλο αυτό τον πανικό πρέπει να κουνήσεις και το πλοίο σου -ένα βήμα ανά αιώνα- για να πουλήσεις τα αγαθά –αν έχει μείνει κανένα και για σένα– μπας και πάρεις κανά πόντο. 
Και πάνω που έχουν αρχίσει να γίνονται πραγματάκια με τις κάρτες σου και τα αγαθά και τα πλοία, ωωωπ end game.

Αν νιώσατε κάτι περίεργο από όσα γράφω παραπάνω, ε κάπως έτσι νιώθω κατά τη διάρκεια του παιχνιδιού. Γι’ αυτό συγχώρα με Στεφανάκο μου, 5 και πολύ.. επειδή είσαι συ!

Temptative rating after 3/4 of a game.  The cube selection system is great, and the Feld's agonizing part (activating the cards) of the game is good and makes sense.  The district part and shipping seems like a foreign addition, but I really enjoyed the mix.
I think it certainly needs the icons in the cards to make it playable.  And it is prone to AP, and it's not a short game.  A bit brain burner.

Macao is another clever, unusual, enticing game from the genius of Stefan Feld. Its core is built around the "wind rose", an heptagon used to allocate action points cubes through a clever dice-based mechanic. This mechanic, together with the hundred cards, has some push-your-luck flavor that's particularly tasty. And the presence of these two factors (dice plus cards) means that no two games will play similar...
There's obviously some flaws as well: the theme is absolutely pasted on, the production is not top-notch (thin cardboard chits, small cards unreadable from distance), and an end game that can be somewhat anti-climatic.
But, in the end, Macao is a game that exhudes genius, and it's a very worthy addition to a euro-lover collection!

I prefer vasco da gama and egizia for the middle-weight euro feel from last essen. the rondel mechanic is innovative and interesting, but the downtime, quite a big reliance on luck in the opening stages, and the fact the end winner can be obvious by mid game mean I am just not that interested in having another go.

There's a new idea in this game with the windrose which is good, but there are a lot of text cards in the game which slow down the game a lot. It lasts about six rounds (out of twelve) before the game begins to roll. So planning is very important, but at the same time very difficult because you can not hold any actionstones for the next round(s).
I've raised my score from 6 to 7 because at second play, we played much more fluent. None of the reasons above have changed, but I think I did understand the way of playing better.

Like this much more than most Feld designs.  The theme does nothing for me, but the mechanics and planning aspects are really great.  The dice/resource/timer mechanic is genius.  It does bother me a bit that the card deck is so large that power combos are hit or miss -but every time I play this I have fun. Along with Egizia this is the other big winner for me in the last year or so of Eurogames.

Normally I hate being at the mercy of random die rolls, but Feld managed to win me over with some clever mechanics.  You can mostly plan for the future by setting aside Action Cubes for later use.  Obviously the dice have a large impact on your game, but I do enjoy coming up with alternative plans to unfavorable rolls.

There are 3 major reasons to fight for turn order: Cards, City Markers, and delivering Wares.  It is possible to stay behind and win, but I prefer paying the AC to stay in the lead.  Others have commented that the theme is pasted on.  Personally, I feel like I am collecting wares and sailing a ship.  Scales very well.

2 plays, doubt I'll have another.

The resource gathering via dice is a nice mechanic, but doesn't work with the other things going on here - the mixture of dry optimisation and huge luck component makes it far too long and hard work for what it is. There's not much you can do if the combinations that you need to construct (sorry, activate) buildings don't appear.

The theme is possibly the most pasted-on I've ever encountered, I have no idea how all the bits of the game are meant to relate to each other.

Many novel and clever mechanisms (ASPIRING BOARDGAME DESIGNER REAPPROPRIATION ALERT!) with little to recommend it as a gamer's game.

Luck arrives in spades, less so with the colored dice than with the card draft. Turn order is hugely important to getting  good choice of cards, true. Worse, most cards reward strategic commitment without providing a way to mitigate the luck that decides whether or not that commitment pays off.

If the game was just about cards and dice, it could be a lightweight game of risk management. Instead, an entire pickup-and-deliver game is bolted on along with two separate spatial puzzles.

On top of ALL OF THAT is a separate source of victory points, randomized each turn and rewarding players who happen to have saved the exact right amount of money.

Blech.

[i]Posted: 4/5/11, Rated: 7[/i]

After a few questionable entries in their [family=58]Big Box series[/family], [company=9]alea[/company] has enjoyed a return to their former glory, due in large part to the design efforts of [person=4958]Stefan Feld[/person].  [i]Macao[/i] utilizes dice in a novel way to allocate future resources.  Combine that with the now ubiquitous deck of special power cards, and you have an interesting game.

I have a nagging suspicion that there might be a general solution to [i]Macao[/i], such as going for 5's and 6's, and then selecting your cards to match the colors you've already collected.  Then again, if everyone does the same thing, then only a few cards will be successfully activated, and everyone else will start taking penalties.  [i]Macao[/i] was pleasant enough, and I do look forward to seeing if it is hiding more depth.

After my first play, I can say I'm intrigued. I like the decisions you have to make about which resources to take upon each die roll and the mechanic to distribute the resources on future turns. This games evolves during play from collecting the right cards, then cubes, then goods, then combos, then movement and delivery while taking advantage of opportune times to buy points and jockey for turn order. There is more going on here than meets the eye. Some refer to this as a lighter game, but I thought it has plenty of depth to discover.

A Feld design that rewards the experienced player who is familiar with the (types of) cards in play and how best to leverage their Activity Cube (AC) resources efficiently to build, deliver goods, generate coinage (GC), and maximize Prestige Points (PP).  Each round players choose AC based on a shared dice roll and place them around their Wind Rose based on the die result.  The higher the number the more cubes of that color, but they are not available until later rounds.  Be careful of the penalties for having no AC in a given round or too many inactivated cards.

Game with some rather nice mechanics but they make no sense whatsoever themewise. What do these different action cubes represent, what does the weel represent, why are all these european cities on different islands of the coast of Macao, what drives the different money/vp exchange rates???? So despite it being developed very wel rulewise and the fact it would probably be very interesting to play, I cannot bring myself to play this dry thematic monstrosity. Even a theme in a Knizia game makes more sense.

It always feels like you are doing something, so it feels fast.  One of the mechanics uses a 7 sided small board for each player.  This allows each player to do some small planing for up to 6 turns into the future.  In the one game I played, you can attempt to plan up to six turns into the future, but since every turn you are getting new cards and city quarters are being purchased, the best you can really do is plan 2-3 moves into the future and hope for the best for the other 4-6.  Still a lot of fun with a lot of tough decisions.

I greatly respect this game design, and totally understand why people would enjoy it. I've always had a fondness for games where you have to plan in advance but I think this one broke me. There is so much you have to try and plan for that I think it would take me years to ever wrap my head around it. Add in the fact that the theme is non-existent, and the potential for analysis-paralysis is through the roof, and you have a game that is totally not for me. Again, I get why people like it because the mechanisms are unique and they function together as a unit quite well. For people who like strategy-heavy and theme-lite games Macao is a homerun.

Initial impression:

Worthless game.  Random dice rolls negate all semblance of planning.  Cards are dumb.

Ultimately, feels like Pillars of the Earth with more to keep track of, more luck, and less strategy.

This is a prime example of a game that pretends to be strategic, while having so much luck that one should think - why bother?

Will be very loathe to play again.

This is an interesting game with a unique mechanic and some neat combinations with the cards.  It is a game of managing the rollercoaster of twists and turns.

I like it!

The theme is definite weak spot and the some of my first plays felt bogged down at times with some of the players.  Playing more with experienced gamers and people familiar with this game makes it better.  A 3 or 4 player game in 60-90 minutes is just right.

RATING: 10
I really enjoyed this one.  Like some of Feld's other games, you have to manage something so you don't take negative points.  This one you have to manage your cards and getting action cubes for each turn.  Easier said than done.  Well, if you focus on it, it's not an issue.  But it's easy enough to go astray.  Lots of different scoring that you need to contend with.  I don't think you can let something go and still win.  I also enjoyed the mechanic of getting action cubes AND how the cards worked.  It added pressure and choices.  You can long term plan in this one.  Also, you can set yourself up for the big turn, as well.  Overall, it was fun, tense and close.  I played this with two people.

I liked with four just as much.  My new comment:

It's what you can make and plan for out of randomness.

I think that sums it up for me.

April '10 - quickly becoming one of my two or three favorite Alea games.  Who am I kidding, this ranks right behind PR for me in Alea games and one of my favorite games at the moment. 

November 2011 - A 10.  I have now played 19 games of this, mostly 2 player.  With playing so many games, I have a great feel on what cards are in the deck and how the cards work together.  I try to let the early cards I draw dictate my plan.  I have discovered that the four cube single color cards are not difficult to get down...you just have to plan for it down the road.  A big key is to grab the joker card for the cube of any color.  This way you can just about get any four color cube card down in a reasonable amount of time and cash in the bennies.  Both my friend and I leave shipping more towards the end of the game and wall position is key.  You do not want to get stuck in last for the whole game.  Stay cose so when you decide you need to pick first, you can.  Just a ton of stuff to consider.  Also, with two, we blaze through a game in about 45 minutes or so.  The second 10 I have bestowed on an Alea game.

RATING: 5
In The Year of the Dragon surprised me.  Stefan Feld hadn't struck me as someone that could put out such a superlative game.  Sadly, Macao sees Feld back to his old ways.  In fact, this strikes me as his worst game by a fairly large margin.

First, Feld needs to expand his scope a bit.  He basically starts with an economic engine game, adds some punishment and a gimmick to constrain actions.  Macao is no different. It's just an amalgamation of mechanics you have seen before with a dice/cube wheel (the aforementioned gimmick).

I actually like the gimmick, the trade-off of many cubes later, a few now is a sound one.  However, this game in no way takes advantage of it.  Long term planning is severely shortchanged by the roll of dice and which cards come up.  Potentially you can look at all the city quarters and the office cards to formulate a plan, but that is a large amount of information that I don't want to digest.

A huge problem here is the pacing and the constraints.  The first 4 rounds are very short and completely worthless.  You have no cubes.  The game opens up for about 6 rounds before you run out of cubes near the end of the game.  It's really demoralizing to have to play the game for so long before you can do anything.  

You get penalized if you skip a turn so no storing up for a big turn and you can't carry cubes between turns.  This doesn't work for the many cards that require multiple colors.  Some of them require 3 (or even 4) colors which is nigh impossible to get and are not exceptionally powerful for the cost.  In fact, the best strategy appears to go for cheap cards because their greatest benefit is 3 points which you get no matter the cost.  A surprising number of cards don't even seem worth building without this point bonus.  A much better design would have more interesting cards that people want to activate rather than compelling them through penalties.

Connecting city quarters seems unnecessarily frustrating as you need essentially the same cube color in increasing amounts to form a chain.  But you can buy only one quarter a round so you have to make sure to iterate that color and do it with a large number.  However, this mechanic does take the most advantage of the dice/cube wheel, which is I guess something.

Thematically, Macao is a mess.  You get cards, buy stuff in some kind of connection game in the quarters and then move a ship around to deliver stuff.  Oh and their are gold coins that do nothing but buy points at a ratio that changes every round.  It felt like Feld was trying to cram too many things into the game at once.  What does the dice wheel even represent?

Agricola and In the Year of the Dragon can feel punishing, but it's ultimately rewarding to play and overcome their tribulations.  Macao tells you to run that way and then turns around and hamstrings you.  You are constantly prodded by the game to do something while it hampers your attempts at following its orders with a healthy dose of randomness.  Just not a whole lot of fun.

I certainly hope Alea lets Feld go work on his own.  I don't know how it turned into his personal label.

This game totally lacks theme. It doesn't even try to hide it like other Euros. Reading cards with abbreviations like AC, PP, blue cubes makes me angry.

Having a card title like WAREHOUSE does not mean that the game has a meaningful theme. It's a math exercise actually with some dice thrown in to mess with players' computations.

After one session I felt like I was doing a chore, noone in my group had fun and we wanted it to end as soon as possible.

A game of minimizing losses.  I won a 4 player game (1st game) but didn't feel like I had much control over the resources.

RATING: 6
After 1 play I found it to be an enjoyable set collection and economic game with a refreshingly innovative dice mechanic.  However, after 2 plays, as much as I enjoy the mechanics and the plethora of options, this game is too long and too dependent on dice rolls.  If you pick a card that takes 4 red cubes and you never roll higher than 3 red during the entire game or if the colors you need simply will not match up at the right time points based on the die rolls, it can be a very painful experience.  Also, there are simply too many unique cards (~100) in the game and you only use half of them with the full complement of players so this considerably slows down the card drafting part of the game (compared to games like San Juan that have repeat cards, which lends to speedier decisions).  Your decisions are mostly involve guessing and hoping that you can obtain the right cubes at the right time points.  It feels like it needs something to mitigate some of the dice and card luck -- maybe allowing players to save one cube between rounds or allowing the placement of cubes one turn before or after the naturally rolled round for a cost of 1 gold and a penalty of 1 cube from the set.

MORE NOTES:  The "envoy" card is a bit of a game breaker since it is so powerful (allowing you to get a cube of your choice for purchasing points which is something you want to do anyway).

UPDATE 2014: My least favorite (by far) major Stephan Feld game.  Too much of the game hinges on luck and guessing.

OTHERS SAY:  A conundrum... a game about planning ahead, but it is centered around dice rolls and card randomness.  First seems like kinder, gentler In the Year of the Dragon or ___, but this facade hides a nasty engine that ruthlessly hands out negative points to unwary gamers.  Novel/clever use of dice.  Roll a handful of multi-colored dice, and then everyone selects 3 to keep. You then get action points in the color of the die equal to its face value, but don't receive them until X turns later where X equals the face value of the die.

Lots of randomness in this game. Random cubes from a bunch of dice rolls and random cards turned up that you can pick. Admittedly there are things you can do to mitigate this, but there's too much luck in this game for me.

RATING: 3
This title combines punitive limitations, game-y euro mechanisms and (at the very least) an interesting dice element. The clever dice resource management is not enough to salvage my experience of Macao; it is, for me, awful. I'm not reacting solely to the punishing nature of this game, as I like Age of Steam and had the foresight to avoid trouble. Macao bound my hands - and worse yet, my imagination - with ceaseless constriction in every round.

That just wasn't fun.

Yet even more Feld genius! Very easy to play and quick to learn. This will take many plays to truly figure out, seems like you have to shift strategies throughout the game while always keeping an eye on your big overall strategy. This one is a real thinker and I like how it plays so quickly. This one will be cherished and dustless for some time.

Huge disappointment here.
Boring, unthematic, without any fun is this game.

With this "new" mechanic planning is very difficult, if not useless. 

The player is driven by the game.
Huge spans in the vp currencies every round kills this game too. 

I have the gut feeling this game was rushed by alea/ravensburger to habe a big game in Essen 2009.

This game is so repetetive, dry to the bone and uninspired that I`m nearly shocked.

Can`t understand how others praise this design.

This one got a lot of rave reviews but it just didn't click for my wife and I.  We found it more frustrating than fun.  It seems way too difficult to get any of the better cards built with the rondel/dice mechanic used to gain cubes.  We found ourselves building cheaper and less useful cards just to avoid taking the penalty for having too many cards.  Granted we've only given it a couple plays, but those early plays were not encouraging for us.

With 4 players two turns to long(10 or 11 should be enough) and you create a lot of cards outlay and downtime for the other players. The 11th & 12th round were a chain mono gameplay, that i lost my interest in this game. Best an remarkable of Macao was the dice rose mechanic of your ordered goods.

RATING: 8
Un juego de gestión de recursos, para obtener puntos de victoria en los doce turnos que dura la partida. Es muy original la mecánica de realización de acciones. Se tiran dados de seis colores y el jugador escogerá dos de esos colores. Cogerá tantos cubos como indique el dado y los colocará en la posición que también indique el dado. Cada turno, se gira la rosa de los vientos y una flecha señala a la posición de donde podrás gastar cubitos para hacer tus acciones. La idea principal es comprar mercancías en macao y llevarlas a las islas moviendo el barco para recibir PV. Además, el juego incluye un montón de cartas que permiten hacer todo tipo de cosas. Esas cartas hay que activarlas y no se deben acumular, pues tener más de las debidas, puede acarrear penalizaciones.
Es un juego con muchos caminos a la victoria. Me gustó mucho. Al estilo de NotreDame, por ejemplo.

A game with several different ways to victory.
You will have to have a good insight in what the other players are into, to be able to stop their progress.
The large amount of cards make each game quite different, and you will not always get the golden combo in each game.
Nice learning curve that with more games played opens up new strategies.

RATING: 6
Typical Alea game. From the artwork to the mechanics everything screams Alea in my opinion.

As the available action cubes for several futire rounds are known in advance it is possible (and probably necessary) to plan relatively far ahead.

There are definitely several roads to victory (money engine --> buy VP every round, heavy shipping, cards), but in order to really play strategically I think you have to know most of the cards, which is a turn-down for me. 

Furthermore, you have to watch the options of your opponents to counter their strategies, which is almost impossible due to the plethora of cards and the small print.

Also, later turns (when lots of cards have been activated already) seem to produce a lot of downtime. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One play. I'm not sure if a few of the cards are overpowered. There are a lot of them - so after learning their functions maybe it will be more even for experienced players. Activating the right cards are important for getting neat bonuses. But also planning ahead with the cubes is vital, as future turns provide less amounts of them toward game end, meaning negative points if you can't build them.

Based on one play at Essen 2009.

Stefan Feld does it again!

How does he do it? Fresh brand new mechanism that is incomparable to anything else out there: a very innovative use of dice. Lots of planning and strategy making. Take a less fruitful action now vs waiting 4 to 6 turns for more actions. Multiple paths to victory. Seems to be balanced. Can play from the front or from the back in turn order, just like In the Year of the Dragon. Tense! Fabulous!

Update: 8 -> 7.5

Luck of the dice CAN still throw the game.

Update Feb 2013. The luck is a bit much for it to be a good strategy game. Drop from 7.5 to 6.

Update Aug 2013. Dropped again from 6 to 5. I'm over this game. The more I play, the more I dislike it.

Incredibly fun game where you have several options of how to win depending on the cards you take.  But you have all the tension of turn order fighting and trying not to get stuck with a bunch of cards on your mat all the while trying to get first to deliver goods and get the best pay out.  Really quality game, nice parts, who knew 250 cubes could be so fun?

One minute you're agonising over whether you'll be able to even do anything, the next turn it's off to shores foreign with a blustery wind at our back and the prospects of a bright future ahead... then suddenly you are scrabbling for scraps in a back alley again, hoping to claw enough away to see the winter through.  Swings and roundabouts this game.

I love this game! Right now I would prefer to play this over the two games (Rook and Settlers) that I have higher on my top 10. However, I've played those other two games waaay more than this one. If my enjoyment of Macao stays after another 40 plays or so it will definately move up my top 10 list!

I love the Alea Big Box series very much, and Macao is a fine addition to a lineage of great games.  Like Loyang, this uses a limited draft, and like Loyang, you will find more chance elements in this one than your average big boxer.  I have no problem with this, but it will turn some off.  There are many nice little tensions and trade-offs in this game, and so far, there seems to be no sure path to victory.  Certainly there are many paths to defeat, and it may be frustrating to some to find that what seems to be a game about getting a gold/VP engine going is actually a game about damage control and buying the least bad of the cards on offer.  The main rule for this one is: get those cards off your tableau!  Aside from that, plan on accomplishing only about half of what you'd like, as you'll only be able to buy VPs every other turn at best.  Like Loyang, this is a bell-shaped game - fast turns at the beginning and the end, with long ones in the middle.  I like the rotating wheel/action accumulation mechanic, there is real tension in deciding to take many cubes down the road or a few in the coming turns.  Of Feld's contributions to the BB line, I think I like this one the best - even given the chance elements, I find it the most challenging and brutal (although ItYotD is probably more brutal with multiple players).  Nice and solid.

RATING: 9
I held off on getting this for a long time, but my newfound love for all-things-Feld made me seek it out. I was not disappointed. Despite the dice and the tableau-building, the game actually resembles an economic game on a small scale. You can try to accomplish short-term goals with a poorer payoff or plan huge moves far in the future, though you'll get punished heavily in the intervening turns if you plan too far in advance. Finding the right balance is the key to success. 

Normally I hate games that require lots of calculation, but it's really a fun exercise to try to look at your cards and the spaces on the board, and then figure out how many cubes of which colors you'll be able to get in X turns. 

My biggest complaint has to do with the cards: too many of them give the same ability, often at vastly varying costs, so it is sometimes annoying to have to choose among cards that do what your completed cards already do. I also wish there were more variety to the cards (i.e. an expansion!). It's a neat little design, though, one I didn't expect to enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really interesting game where you have to plan ahead.  It's a shame the rulebook seems to be lacking in actually describing all components, and there are a few  cards that seem to have ambiqous language, which can lead to mistakes in gameplay.  I can forgive these things, because the game is really interesting, though I worry a bit about actual interaction between the players.  More plays will sniff that concern out if it's a fault.

I've only played this once so far, but I enjoyed it.  I hear others saying that there really is only the illusion of planning, but it didn't feel like that the one time I played.  I certainly want to play it more to see if that is true.

RATING: 6
I enjoy the windrose element of choosing between fewer cubes quickly or more cubes later in the game, but the randomness of the dice rolls and card draws creates more chaos than I like in a game that requires so much forward planning.  I'll play it if others are interested, but it's not a game I'll suggest.

This was one of the first Euros I ever played that I was "wowed" by.  The mechanics are so interesting and I remember thinking about that game for days afterward.  Theme is pasted on and some mechanics don't make thematic sense, but it plays great.

EDIT - After having played many more Euros since then, I have come to prefer those with gameplay a bit more connected to their theme.  Down to a 7 from 8 (initially a 9).

Another solid release from alea and Stefan Feld; they've sort of jumped on the Agricola bandwagon with lots of different cards with lots of special powers that you need to play. Identifiable as a Stefan Feld, it's got that pressure of penalties if you don't get certain thing done. (FWIW, some players would like the game better if simply got 3VP for every card you played instead of a 3VP penalty for unplayed cards).

I felt that Notre Dame was a little light theme-wise, but Macao really feels very theme-deficient to me.

Most Stefan Feld games have taken a while to grow on me. Notre Dame especially grew on my as I played it more, especially as I limited it to smaller number of players. Macao will probably fall into this category as well, although for different reasons. Macao feels mechanically clever and pretty clean, but thematically clunky. As I play more the theme may feel better, allowing the rating to rise.

Because of the theme deficiency and the complexity I suspect the audience for Macao is pretty narrow, mostly the serious hobbyist gamers amongst us, moreso even than most alea games.

But for now anyway, I'm enjoying it and look forward to playing it some more.

I really want to like this one more than I did... in fact, I'm just plain unsure where I want to rate this.  I really enjoyed the various ways to score points.  It seems there are quite a few strategies to pursue.

However, the cool part of the game, which is the mechanism for gaining cubes, was also the biggest drawback.  It seems pretty difficult to ever get the right combination of cubes for stuff that requires more than 2 colors of cubes.  We all felt that it would be nice to have more cards that transmute cubes into other colors.

Also, I wished there was a little better card variety.  It seemed that most cards were very similar... some of them even had identical functions, but with different costs to activate, which I found odd.

I don't know, overall I still thought it was pretty neat, but I just didn't feel the pull to play this all that often.  Perhaps more play will reveal more.

there isn't much new i can add from what others have said about this game. it's an intriguing game mechanically and once the game hits the midpoint things really start to build and the whole engine starts to come together.  There are a variety of strategies which can be combined depending on the cards you manage to select and activate.  Getting first on the wall can be key to getting the right cards.  Unfortunately the art is a little bland, the theme is lacking and sometimes its hard to follow a few of the cards, which probably weren't translated well.

Forget about theme here: 17th-century Portuguese adventurers ... blah, blah, blah.  This game is really a mashup of several really interesting ideas from Stefan Feld.  The wind rose mechanism is neat and forces one to plan ahead and accumulate resources for future turns.  The card drafting mechanism, forced hand management, and activation of cards before being allowed to use their abilities remind me of Magic: the Gathering.  The possession of city quarters and shipping of goods seem somewhat disconnected from the other aspects of the game.  The "tribute" component makes no sense thematically.  Nonetheless, this game is good, enjoyable exercise for the ol' noggin.

By the way, a monkey at a typewriter could have written a better rulebook.  What a piece of shit.  Have a quick look through the rules forum before playing, especially at the list of cards that can be used more than once per turn.

The way the dice wheel forces you to plan ahead without being in total control is something that I love. It requires contingency planning and odds calculations, and sometimes you just have to gamble. This will create neverending randomness and replayability. Yeah, you can be screwed by the dice sometimes, but so what? Managing that is what keeps things fun. If you're the type of gamer who needs a plan for the entire game as soon as the box is opened, then you should avoid this.

The dice rose selection "a little now or a lot later" is neat.
My biggest bitch about this game is the cards.
I think instead of "GC" it should show a coin. And instead of "AC", it should show an Action Cube.
Secondly, I seem to be enjoying less and less games with lots of different specific cards  that one must read through each turn. I guess I'm longing for games of a more elegant time, so to speak.

The wind rose is a unique mechanic which is rather cool as it forces you to think a couple of turns ahead and also make you sweat about taking a few actions now or more later.
I'm not sure if I like or don't like that there are sooo many cards and you will never see the same, but there sure is a great amount of tactics and strategy regarding the cards and how/when to get them out!

I also give a thumb up for the various ways in which you can spend your action cubes and score prestige points. A good euro game - but I have to admit that there are many others I like more, which can be said about most of Feld's designs; I like them a lot (most have ratings of 7-8), but I don't LOVE them.

Good use of dice and planning in this game. All the while, trying to get the right color combination needed in a slot to activate cards and and take over cities. Like most other Feld games there are lots of ways to score victory points and no direct player interaction. The cards themselves are a little difficult to interpret the meaning and may require some looking up. Overall, this game is great with lots of replay and plays well with all player counts.

I enjoyed the game and thought the dice/cube mechanism was interesting and fun.  However, there were a few drawbacks.  It seemed like there was no way to catch up toward the end; in fact, there was not so much to do at the very end.  Also, it has the same problem as Loyang: you do a hoard of actions all at once, and so you can really sit there during other people's turns waiting for them to deal with a bunch of actions and cards.  It doesn't matter much, but the color scheme was dull as can be.  Also, the text on the cards is tiny.

The big problem with this game is that the game plays you. The game asks you to formulate a long term strategy by forcing you to take cards that have building requirements.  Then, the game randomizes what combination of building requirements you get in each turn - which can be eternally frustrating or amazing if your lucky enough.  I love games where the dice randomizes the play area and everyone has to adapt - and this masquerades as a game like that - but it can totally screw you while helping your neighbor at the same time, so its not really like that.  It seemed to me that the game was just Yspahan with an additional layer of abstraction (the cubes) and more 'hoping' you get the die roll you need.  On the plus side, the card powers are fun and the cube/dice mechanism is new and refreshing.  Hopefully with another play I will feel differently.

18/12/11 - Interesting game, but there's a heavy dose of luck and games can change quickly depending on the cards that come out.  I don't know, I won but I'm a bit turned off by the luck aspect.

Another tableau builder from Feld that definitely ebbs and flows. We flew through the first few rounds and the last couple rounds took a long time due to how the action point mechanic / wind rose works. Also with each player having 10+ cards out towards the end slowed the rounds down greatly too. The wind rose is definitely a neat mechanic although I'm not sure I enjoyed the rest as it felt too bloated compared to Feld's other tableau builder Bruges.

I think I enjoyed Bruges more for two reasons. First, it does play quicker and second it has just a little bit more randomness in the card draw that I like in my games. In the end I think Macao was just a little too heavy and long for me. I certainly appreciate it and can see why so many like it though.

Alea big box es una referencia para los más veteranos y de esta colección han surgido juegos ya míticos en el Olimpo Lúdico (Puerto Rico, Príncipes de Florencia, Taj Mahal) Stefan Feld mantiene el nivel de la serie, no solo eso ademas ha convertido en imprescindibles los juegos de la trilogía que ha realizado para la caja grande de Alea (Notre Dame, En el año del Dragón, Macao). Es un juego denso, sin ser  necesariamente complejo y que hace que las partidas sean muy ajustadas y no se decidan hasta el final, es muy agradable de jugar, aunque no lo aconsejaría sacar con jugadores que tiendan al A/P. El único defecto que le encuentro es el tema de las cartas, Alea las podría haber diseñado más agradables visualmente y que no fueran tan dependientes del idioma. Es un juego de gestión puro un poco abstracto que divertirá a los amantes de esta mecánica, a destacar lo novedoso del mecanismo de la rosa de los vientos y los dados, lo veremos en próximos juegos, seguro. De todas formas a pesar de que el juego me gusta bastante no creo que llegue a ser nunca un TOP 25 de la BGG (ni siquiera un TOP 50)

During the game, I just wanted to make it stop. Looking back on it, I'd like to try it again, but it's not a game I could ever get my husband to try. 

Update: at a con, I told a friend I vaguely regretted getting rid of this. He said, "Okay, there's a copy over there. Let's go play it now. Okay? You don't want to, do you? You know you don't." He was SO RIGHT.

Tied for my favorite Felds (with Castles of Burgundy) and one of my favorite games of all time. I generally prefer games that skew tactical over strategic, and the tactics in this game are awesome. Its the perfect balance between long and short term planning.

RATING: 8
Has quite a bit of luck, but a most can be mitigated (concentrating on specific cube colors, knowing the deck, working with offices etc). The game has enough meat that the luck does not bother me, quite the opposite. There exist 4 basic strategies (buying VPs, goods area control, efficient goods delivering, card comboing) but one must stay tactical and keep one's options open. 

Interaction is usually subtle, but can get quite fierce towards the end of the game, when one can see the good he needs being snatched under his feet. Turn order is very important, especially at 3-4 players. The game requires forward planning ala Trajan or Luna, and stands happily shoulder to shoulder with both these games.

Overall, Macao is a well oiled system that still keeps entertaining after quite some years, and does not suffer from the point explosion or unnecessary intertwining complexity that has plagued the last Feld games. A vintage Feld, and a really smooth one. Keeper.

Τhe definition of an overrated game. An abstract game, with a completely pasted theme. Planning with dice is a joke and of course planning of strategy a bigger joke. I regret I played it twice, it is one time too many. A great example of how an idea can turn into nothing.

Likes: I'm always a big fan of games that make interesting use of dice and can minimize the agony that is dice. This game is a classic Stefan Feld that requires you to plan ahead and strategize, competing with limited resources of other players.

Dislikes: The randomized initial player order bothers me a bit.

Fun!  Nice variety of choices: What dice to use, which district to buy, where to spend all the ACs, etc. You really need to let your mind wander a bit to even get a whiff of theme, but it's there.
First play w/ 3 players.  Medium weight, but not a brain-burner.  This is probably rated best for 3, because of the time & downtime per player.  Diffucult for AP-prone players.
Second play was a 2-Player game.  A bit different, as there was more room in the city quarters than in the 3-player game.
One of my favorite games to play solo, using 2 players, each playing as aggressive as possible.

Update: I don't find myself really wanting to play this much. As much as I really like the way the dice work, and the "saving for the future", I'm just not a big fan of the zillions of different cards, and not knowing which you'll actually see in the game, especially when some of the cards go better with other cards. Rating down to a 7.
------------
Feld is on a roll. That's four for four with me on his Alea big box games. This is hands-down better than Notre Dame. I think most people will prefer this over Rum & Pirates, although personally I have a soft spot for that game. It's hard to compare to In The Year of the Dragon, only because that game is significantly simpler. Macao has a bunch of cards that do stuff that you need to acquire, and what I learned in my single playing so far is that you can just get whatever and hope it works out. You need a plan. Those with a plan will be rewarded and those without will be punished. The game feels "hard" like ITYotD, in that at first glance the game taunts you with lots of stuff to do, but it's actually really hard to do stuff. But the core mechanic is realy neat. The use of dice is in a shared way that doesn't really screw anyone individually, but the cool thing is that you get action cubes which you allocate to specific future turns. The more in the future you allocate them, the more you get (in general), so it's almost like an action point savings plan. At the end of the day you're doing some fairly mundate stuff (collecting resource chits, selling them at foreign ports), but how you do it feels pretty fresh.

Macao was played first by me at a long since gone Spiel (edition 2009 to be exact) where my partner and I had commandeered a small table deep within the Ravensburger enclosure. We could finally play a game in quiet there (as that episode was unusually busy and crowded); we only had to tell off one other person. We found the game fairly easy going, with what appeared to be a cute dice mechanism, but my partner complained about having a disfunctional card engine due to bad overlap between her cards. I contributed it in part to being new to the game, and in another to being a sore loser. We didn't purchase a copy, though, knowing that a Dutch edition would arrive soon, and that we'd need another attempt to make up our minds for sure. That opportunity came a few months later, but it more or less turned me around on Macao completely. I was stuck in exactly the same position as my partner this time, and couldn't really make the system work in my favour. The capriciousness of the dice, which have you wildly guessing at what you need when, soon became a thing to loathe with a passion instead of recognising it as a novelty in game mechanism design. Cards turning up when you least need them, but being forced to pick them up just the same, was very annoying. The final straw was the habit of the game to punish you for things you don't really have any genuine control over. I have since avoided the game for years on end until I was made to play the game one final time. And lo and behold, the game still behaved as treacherously as in my memory. In the end I probably didn't do too bad, though.

My main beef with Macao is that the game rewards long-term planning while offering you very few tools to do exactly that. You have no say in how the dice turn out as they do, but the combination between colour and number of pips is crucial. Only two cards are known per turn... but in order to have first pick you must invest really heavily in the turn order scheme and brave the swells of the Sea of Player Chaos. Or face the consequences, which is a pattern Feld revisted and elaborated (and then some!) in the even more clamping-down-on-the-players'-genitalia title AquaSphere. There is no real way to bypass the system: you either undergo its ministrations or you don't play the game at all. I chose the latter option, and hope that it will be a very, [i]very[/i] long time ere I experience them again.

Like most older Felds, this one eases the descisions amongst a plethora of options by only allowing a specific subset to be executed at any given time. This adds a certain element of timing and planning actions as well. Very welcome change of pace compared to his more recent dice-driven optimization games.

Interesting twist on the action point allowance genre.  What makes the game unique is you select action cubes tied to dice rolled in those colors, and then assign them around a 7-sized dial at their appropriate space (5 cubes goes next to the 5).  Then you rotate the dial once space, and use the cubes formerly at the 1 spot for your turn.  This leads to a need to think several turns ahead at what you may want to do later.

Definitely challenging to figure out how to do all you want to do, but this game moves fast and is easy to understand once you get moving.  This is a tight little game from Stefan Feld that was instantly satisfactory and made me want to play it again.

The first Feld I acquired. Took me several games to get my head around planning for the Windrose. Macao definitely grew on me after several plays. Balancing card builds (go for easy or go for points or go for capability?), city sections (go for goods or go for large connections?), wall moves, ship moves (can I get those goods delivered?), and prestige buys against the realities of the cube availability, provides an ever changing challenge. I like how the limitted turns constrain the game length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game proper is great: fantastic combination of short-term tactical optimization with long-term planning in the face of uncertainty. It really takes a full game or two to get a sense for "how difficult is [card X] going to be to get out?", and longer than that to get a good handle on valuing many of the cards in the person/building deck... but can be played decently (and be a lot of fun) on the first go-round. The better you get at the game, the more valuable turn order becomes, because the better you are at recognizing what to draft.

The production/translation could have been much better done, though; Rio Grande kind of fell down on this one: there are multiple ambiguous (or unintuitive-to-English-speakers) translations, a card titled "Office" that is not an Office card but a Building card, acronyms ("AC" and "GC") instead of clear icons, no pictures on the Warehouse cards to show what type of goods they operate on, and more. It makes me very sad - the game's so good, it's a shame that it's marred by these factors, particularly as they make it harder to teach to new players.

[Edit: I'm now beginning to feel like initiative order is a little *too* important - that the disparity in drafting order with experienced players is huge, mostly, though the ability to claim/ship first can also be quite relevant. This should in theory self-correct, because the opportunity cost of spending cubes on initiative in early game can be quite high... but I'm not sure I like the overall dynamic. Still love the core planning puzzle, though.]

Components: Attractive board. Lots of tiny cubes. The cards are a bit plain, and could do a better job of distinguishing some of the types of information (e.g. w/ iconography instead of words for the office cards), but are otherwise functional.

Experience: In this game, the size of the components doesn't matter. The shipping lanes, occupying two-thirds of the board, occupies only a very small part of the game and final score. The quarters, filling out the rest of the board, matter a bit more, but not by much. Most of my attention is on my dice rondel and on my player board. I've never so needed to look explicitly into the future during a game, trying to build up the right combinations of cube colors on each upcoming turn. There are many different routes to take, for different costs, leading to distinct strategies among the players. The toughest decision each round is in how to allocate the dice.

This is a great game.
There are a lot of options on each turn. The action cube system takes some time to get used to and it requires you to plan ahead.
Turn order is important and you have some control over your order.
There are lots of cards which will take a few plays to get used to. You don't go through the whole deck in a game. There are at least 3 areas of the game which seem independent, but you've got to make them work together to win.

A game in which collecting usable card combinations is central, but with very little interaction between players (reminds me of Dominion). An interesting dice-handling mechanism, but it makes long-term planning difficult, because the required dice-combinations may or may not arise. The theme is hopeless. Why should coloured cubes allow you to buy districts in a city, advance along a wall, move ships, or activate a customs office? OK, it is complex resource-management, but assembling random combinations of coloured cubes does not engage my interest, or fit with any idea of building a trading-empire in China.

A really intriguing mix of long-term planning and chaos elements that keeps you on your toes. Our first game with four took 2.5 hours, but then there is a lot to parse. Thankfully, we all were prepared when it came to our individual turns and play was pretty brisk - most of the downtime came when we were reading the various cards up for grabs. I'm very keen to try it with three players and see if the game time shortens up closer to 90 minutes, as that feels like a sweet spot for this sort of game, although I felt engaged for our entire game.

Probably will feel better after a few games, most of Feld's game have a learning curve.

Great game if you like planning ahead.  The rules are VERY simple.  The complication is in the play.  I think three players was the right number for competition for the trade goods.  Turn order was a big priority in the game to make sure that cards could be activated.  The bonuses available are simple, but make a huge difference.  The only down side is that you have to keep a lot in your head at once.  Loved it.

At the end of the 17th century, Macao – the mysterious port city on the southern coast of China – is a Portuguese trading post in the Far East. The players take on the role of energetic and daring adventurers. Many exciting tasks and challenges await the players, whether they are a captain, governor, craftsman, or scholar. Those who chose the wisest course of action and have the best overall strategy will earn the most prestige at the end.

A fabulous game with several great and original mechanics:

First of all, there´s the action programing through the wind rose, a real neat concept. This actions must then be coordinated with the need to vacant slots in each player´s playmat for the characters that come in each turn and with the best possible routes made with our vessel to sell goods, as choosing the best ways to collect goods in the city.
This is a somewhat forgotten gem from Stefan Feld, beeing hard to understand the reason why is out of print.

RATING: 7.5
Macao is certainly the best of Stefan Feld's recent 3 designs (Burgundy, Macao, Trajan). I like the fairly simplistic, yet thinkiness to it. I can see there being some frustration with money at the end, since players can only buy VPs once in a given turn (leftover cash earns nothing), but with only two plays, I am not willing to make that critique. 

The rondel mechanic is much more pleasing to "endure" than the mancala-like part of Trajan. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with Stefan Feld's designs, and this one is no exception. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros:
- Medium weight euro
- Dice mechanism balanced since it is a pool of options everyone chooses from
- Cube/action management is unique

Cons:
- Long term strategy planning is restricted to card draw and draft
- Strategies seem limited as scoring is primarily made up of the same things: acquiring a district, delivering goods, avoiding negative VP by activating cards. So replayability is a concern despite card variability.

Initial Impressions:
Each turn is a puzzle that's presented to you in terms of which cards to pick, which action cubes to choose from the dice, and how to use those cubes to best further your path to getting the most points. Managing this type of challenge is exactly what I like about euro-style board games.

The plethora of cards available means that no two games should be very similar. Some small randomization of the board setup and each turn has a variable amount of points to buy.

The theme isn't too strong because I don't feel like a trader but that hardly matters.

I love the delayed ignition of the windrose, but the game has too little card combos and interaction to really fire me up. There is a immense difference in round length between the start and end game, so much so that I can't imagine myself playing this with more than 2 players.

There's a 7-sided "cube wheel" each players gets in this game. Each round, you rotate the wheel one space and get to use the cubes on that space.

Also each round, you get to load cubes onto a couple spaces... but the trick is that to get larger numbers of cubes, you have to place them on further away spaces--meaning you won't get to use them for many rounds.

Beyond that, the game has a shipping/delivery element, a battle for turn order, the ability to acquire different types of buildings and people (all with different powers), and an unusual variable exchange rate victory point purchasing option.

Lots of good stuff here.

Apparently wheel mechanics are the new hotness right now, because this game has yet another variation on it. It's kinda interesting I guess.

It seems like something that ought to provide room for short term tactics and long term strategy, but the reality is most of your decisions are being driven by whatever building or person card you were forced to select. And since those are random, and the dice are random, then it's just a matter of applying the leftover cubes to whatever's available. Plus, the game runs about 30 minutes too long.

So, at the end of the day, just another euro mish-mash.

A little bit dissapointed in this game. It has been compared a lot to Agricola, and while I found the mechanics interesting and it has what Agricola lacks, the games play nothing aliike.

In Agricola, a player can look at certain buildings and cards and plan a strategy, but with Macow, luck just feels like it plays to big a part and it becomes one of those games where your just making the best possible actions on your turn with limited ability to plan ahead.

RATING: 7
Interesting, but simple tension between selecting lots of cubes for later or less cubes NOW, especially with the rapidly reducing regions to select from. But ultimately I found this a bit unsatisfying given the potential for a good investment engine building game, but players can easily be punished by a bad die roll leaving them with no cubes in a turn.
But again, thats part of the tension - wighing the risks and placing your bet.
Happy enough to play again, but a lesser Alea in my opinion.

The game has a steep learning curve that pretty much requires a full game to understand so experienced players have a huge advantage against new players.

The game would be much better if cards used icons instead of words. The font on the cards is too small.

Also the red/green/purple colors on the cards cannot be distinguished by the color blind.

The game mechanic of getting resources is neat, but the lack of attention to usability takes this game from great to at best good.

Massive replay-ability in this great old-school Feld. This is back before he caved to the whiners and removed all the penalties from his games. Macao is a tight-rope dance of luck mitigation... EDIT!

EDIT: Man, was I wrong about this one. Like Bora Bora, or the god-awful Bruges, this is a game that forces you to commit to a path, then sit back and watch whether you guessed right. Either the stuff you need comes out or it doesn't. Whoever lucks into the best combos wins.

Bought 8 April 2010.

Very good game and much less AP prone than I thought. Took far less time than expected too (around 2 hours with 4 new players) which was a good thing as well. In hindsight I realize we made a lot of bad decisions, you need to plan ahead far more than we did and not just hope the right dice will turn up (which they never do). The dice mechanic is awesome by the way, few resources now or more in the far future, hard choice to make. 

All in all a game I'll gladly play again.

Update. Just a bit too long to be really good. Lowered rating from 8 -> 7.

Has mechanics that I love.  Dice that aren't dice, power cards to buy, sets to pick up and deliver.  But the challenge of getting your plan to work just isn't in your hands.  In San Juan and RftG, if you want a card, you can work towards getting it.  Here, you may just never roll the right purple number, and never see a purple generating card.  The hand size of 5 seems like a kludge to cover the fact that it can just be impossible to do anything.  I don't want to not do anything.  

I love me my dice, but the resource model should be changed to something deterministic.  Like cube color levels grow, and taking a color resets the count or gives you a penalty to taking that color again or something.  Then increase land costs.  So then you'd balance taking short piles to get multi colored cards out and waiting for big piles to gather.  Or something.  Something other than "Oh god, just roll purple near red one gorram time."

RATING: 9
I am really enjoying this game.  Might be worth picking up.  It offers a lot of combinations to score points.  However, there is a big chunk of luck in that you start committing to a combo before you know if you'll ever be in a position to pull it off.  Sometimes the dice don't give you what you need and things can turn sour.  It's a game as much about luck mitigation as it is in realizing good combos.

Could see this going up to a 9 w/more plays.

Update - bumping this game up to an 8.  I just really, really like this game.  It might be my favorite Feld game.

I am not normally a Stefan Feld fan, so Macao is bit of an exception in my general level of appreciaiton. I think what stood out for me most about this game was how this game forced you to build both your prison and your escape route at the exact same time. I like how the dice system creates a pool of available options rather than simply being a way to resolve the success of actions, and the card drafting system makes them as much events to survive as opportunities to take advantage of. It really is a quite entertaining game, I am just not sure it is quite interesting enough to own.

This Stefan Feld games has all the right mechanisms. But I find that I dislike this one compared to his other great games. The major factor is the text and the language that is used. It is difficult to crowd around the table to read those small cards. This slows down the game and makes it slightly frustrating. Otherwise a good game.

RATING: 8
Players are trying to acquire prestige in the city of Macao.  Solid little "engine" game where players are forced to take a card each turn, which they can activate, or ignore for an end of game penalty.  Different, and slightly weird, system where cubes are allocated out onto an action wheel, which is then ticked over to give your your cubes for the coming round.  Cubes are spent on driving your ship, acquiring quarters of the city, activating your reserved cards, and so on.  Engaging game, thematically disconnected, but does hook you in.  The early turns fly by, but it bogs down as the cubes pile up, and the final four turns seem to take an age.  Would love it if it was 30 minutes faster, other than that, excellent ideas and a good game.

RATING: 8.5
The clever dice mechanic makes this one a joy to play.  It allows long term planning with just the right amount of risk-taking. There are a few issues with poor card translation or hesitation about the functions of certain cards, and some better word choices for rules translations could have made the game easier to teach and less confusing for new players. This is the only thing holding this back from a higher rating.

THE DEALBREAKERS: The pacing is off; the most interesting part of the game ends before the game does.  By the time you finally get your engine together, it is just not that satisfying to turn the crank on it.  Too much dependency on what dice rolls and cards come up for a calculating cube-pusher.  

I generally appreciate this game and the way all the parts fit together.  At first, I liked the challenge of trying to put together the right engine to allow the purchase of PP each turn.  If you can but PP on just one turn when your opponents can't, you'll have a big advantage.  I also like the trade-off between a couple cubes now or a bunch of cubes later.

However, I'm finding this less interesting with repeated plays.  You need to deal with multiple levels of randomness, so you can't count on either the dice or the cards you'd like to see come up.

I think my biggest issue with the game is with its pacing.  You can't do a whole lot at the beginning. Then, you do a bunch of stuff towards the middle and finally get your engine in play, but then in the last third of the game you are awash in cubes and pretty much just mopping up.  That last third takes the longest to play out because you need to dink all your cards and deal with all your cubes.  Consequently, the game loses some momentum at the endgame.

What is up with the thin cardboard?  The tokens in this game and Notre Dame are barely acceptable.  Come on guys, this is the Alea Big Box series!  Step it up!

So to sum up: I found the game quite interesting at first, mainly due to the dice mechanism, but the game lost its luster for me with more plays.

There is something about Stefan Feld games that feel very similar.   I think it is the penalization, maybe.  Notre Dame has that, In The Year Of The Dragon has it, and this game has it too.   In other ways, it's like a combination of mini-games:  build the biggest cluster on a grid, make deliveries on a map, select abilities/characters from a pool, jockey for turn order on a track.   It's all stuff we've seen before.   Except...  for the dice mechanic, which amounts to an action point system for the current turn and future turns.  Without this, the game wouldn't work.   Good stuff, I'd like to play it some more.

Seems to be very random, but somehow one player can consequently won several plays in a row.

In the other hand, that 'randomness' makes every play completly different and that is why I like this game. You have to struggle every turn, with this what you get (bad cards, dices or both).

Only one play under my belt, so this may change, but I liked the game.  The biggest challenge for a new player was figuring out how to manage the choosing of the dice.  This is critical as one must simultaneously do both short and long term planning.  I absolutely love the wind rose action cube mechanic.

Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 7
A játék nálam kb 8-as. de mivel nyelvfüggő (és nincs magyarul) rögtön -1. (A szerzőt az egy eddigi játéka alapján,amit játszottam: Notre Dame: kedvelem) Jól összerakott, fix 12 körös játék. A kártyák miatt változatos -nem játszik az összes lap egyszerre-. Ugyanakkor a kártyák hátrány is, akkor ha vki többször játszott: jobban sejtheti mik jönnek/jöhetnek, talán jobban fel tud készülni rá. Itt úgy gondolom számít a játék rutinja, ismerete. (Ami persze pozitívum: anno az Endevornél írtam, h a jóságán még gondolkodom, hisz az aki sokat játszott már vele, mégis utolsó lett a kezdőkkel szemben, itt nem volt ilyen probléma: csúnyán lenyomott minket. :-). De és épp ez mutatja a játék jóságát: a 3 kezdő nagyjából egy szinten állt a  végén, 5-6 pont különbségekkel). Ami igazából csak a kockák féleségén áll. Azért alapvetően érdemes az elején teljesen függetlenül a lapoktól 4-5-6-os kockákat sokat begyűjteni, aztán azokhoz igazítani a húzást. 
A kockás gyűjtögetős forgatós óra mechanizmus ötletes, és ha a mi általunk kigondolt, kis forgó kerék, a végeken anyagtárolókkal dizájnolta volna, akkor még feldobná, szebbé tenné :-), igaz jelentősen drágítaná valszeg a játékot.
hibája: picit talán túl hosszú, és az utolsó kör /talán körök/ előre lefutottak.

UPDATE: after revisiting this game a few times recently, I've bumped it back to an eight.  The dice mechanics are unique and way cool.

There are lots of choices for your action cubes and a bit of terminology, which can make things a little confusing.  That being said, it isn't too hard to follow.  It is -crucial- to bank action cubes for later in the game if you want any hope of winning. Overall, it is a fun game, but not the funnest I've played.

Pros
Lots of choices
Dice randmoness doesn't ruin the game.  The wind rose mechanic is actually pretty cool.
The mechanics of the game in general are interesting and allow forward planning.
Your moves can affect other players

Cons
The setting is cool, but the rules aren't always consistent with it.

For me all the bad stuff about Stefan Feld is packed in here. Theme - sucks monkey balls. Gameplay - just pushing things around without any idea of the purpose. Goals - vague. Components - featureless. And for an eurogame it's totally overloaded with text.

Wow - really deserves the hype it gets.  Bruges' older and more mature brother.  You are building a tableaux with cards of people and buildings that give you various perks and abilities but then there is is whole area control and pick-up and deliver aspect to the game.  The windrose is a masterful game mechanic that made my brain hurt (in a very good way).  So happy I was able to get a copy of this wonderful Feld title that has been OOP for a while.  Only complaint is the component quality and artwork which seemed very... brown.

the wheel is a nice game mechanic that leads to some interesting decisions, however the game around it is rather ordinary which normally would give it a higher rating then I do (6.5 initial) but production quality is surprisingly bad... the color scheme is terrible and very hard to distinguish from across the table. the cards are terribly small with small print, and you either have remember what your opponents played, constantly look/ask them what their cards do, or not care... none of which lead to an ideal game experience... i'd rate this as a try before you buy... and that comes from a Feld fanboy.

Fun little thinker game in which "luck" is nicely imbedded so that it can be part of your decisions. For instance, the rose.. lots of resources later, a few now or the cards revealed each turn.

I'd play this again, but my first thoughts are that it's too much chaos for the amount of time it takes.  It took us 2.5 hours with a group of veteran BGGs, though some were new to this particular game.  If it were a 1 hour game, I'd rate it a little higher.  As it is, I'd really have to be in the right mood for it.

Played once.  A good game, but very tactical, with the dice helping to shape your choices.  Not as random as it may seem, it's really about assessing your available options and spotting the "needle in the haystack".  There is also some opportunities for longer term planning, although it seems like it'll take a couple of games under your belt to master that, and the dice or card ordering in the deck still can mess you up.  Fun, though.

A bunch of weird mechanics jammed into a game that somehow works. Macao feels different compared to a lot of euros.

[1 play] I can't say there was any great novelty to this game.  Au contraire, it was yet another Euro with a bunch of cubes, set back in the day, with a trade theme, named after a place.  Stop me if you’ve heard this one before!  And yet I found it pretty agreeable.  

The first thing that struck me about this game was that there was a big heap of green cubes, but they told me I couldn’t be green.  What?!?!  Turns out that the most common colors (actually, green, purple, red, blue, black, gray) have been used for resources, and the player colors are the leftover obscure colors (orange, brown, white, and I’m not sure what else because we had a 3p game).  This seemed like an interesting reversal of the usual approach.  Not sure if there might be a difference in which way is more colorblind-friendly.  

Macao does actually have some nifty and interesting mechanics (and it’s definitely another for the "clever nontraditional uses of dice in Euros" category).  Foremost among these is the wind rose.  We actually began the game with a discussion of whether this should or should not rightly be called a rondel.  When someone says "rondel" to me, I think of the rondel as used in Imperial or Finca, where the slices of the wheel are different actions and you (attempt to) move around to the one you want.  In a way, the wind rose in Macao is sort of the reverse: the wheel moves steadily, and you stack the slices with the resources you want to put in different positions to enable different actions when you get there.  I thought this was really cool.  

One thing I really like about this game is that, although many of the things you can do, and probably the ones you’re most intent on trying to accomplish, require specific combinations of resources, there are other actions (the turn-order wall, sailing your ship) that can be done with ANY resources you have.  It’s very groovy that even if things don’t work out just as you’d like, still nothing goes to waste.  

I struggled in the first half of this game, but made a sweeping comeback to win by a substantial margin.  The Bank (free gold every turn) and the Diplomat (allows you to do the tribute action--buying victory points--twice) were a powerful combination.  The Diplomat was strong only because I had gold to spend and the tribute ratios were favorable, but I think the Bank would always be great to have.  It also helped that I took 6s a lot in the early rounds, and built up a bunch of cubes for later (though not quite enough!).  I think the cards that give you extra ship movement would also be tremendously worth having.

One of Feld's very best.  A bit more [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/777972/macao-or-burgundy]unforgiving than Castles of Burgundy[/url].

Macao evidences true innovation in its game design, and is a veritable triumph of mechanics over theme. The innovative use of dice in the wind rose action cube mechanic, as well as the variety and replayability in the 120+ cards are two shining stars of game design. Given the labyrinth of multiple strategies and depth of gameplay, players will find themselves desperately trying to manage whatever random elements are present, and finding combinations and strategies to exploit in their quest for victory. Experienced gamers who enjoy the challenge of the classic cube-pushing euro and are prepared to immerse themselves in this masterpiece, will readily appreciate the genius evident in Stefan Feld's Macao, and find themselves richly rewarded with return visits.

What the hell? Stefan Feld is one sado-masochistic dude. You are severely limited in your ability to plan but are penalized for when plans don't come through precisely. Holy crap. I felt like I was spinning plates on my toes standing on the back of an elephant on a tricycle riding over a pit of lava and God forbid I should drop anything. I'm OK with being penalized for lack of planning, but I don't like being penalized for planning well but then being totally screwed through no fault of my own. The game commits one of my most detested gaming crimes by catching players in AP as they plan for the risks they wish to take but then having all their planning undone by the dice anyway. Good thing we spent all that time planning, eh? A game for masochists.

My current favorite as of early 2013.  Enjoy the tactical component in having to react and adjust any strategy based on the cards available and dice that are rolled.

The limit of cards on your tableau can add a bit of suspense. If you take more difficult cards to activate, it may take several rounds before the cubes become available - if at all. It is fun to balance short-term goals along with the need to save cubes for later rounds.

The more I play, the better it gets.  Great use of dice to employ an action point allowance system.  Players must manage the benefit of getting little cubes early vs. more later. Gaining money is also important in order to gain VPs through the tribute track.

Many interweaving things to consider, and player interaction is mostly focused on who gets what first - whether it be shipping an item, taking a card, or placing an ownership token in the city quarters.  Takes about 90-120 minutes to play.  There is some slight downtime with reading the text on the cards, but after more games are played the cards become more familiar and 2nd nature.

This is an excellent game with relatively little to complain about.  Everything works well.  While the gameplay is smooth, the struggle to do what you would like is anything but!  There is a noticeable pace to the game.  Towards the end there is a "critical mass" buildup with the combinations of cards players accumulate.  Some brainburning is involved to decipher the best timing of actions, what resources to get, and the best order to use the activated cards.

Stefan Feld is becoming one of the "sure bets" in boardgame design, and is one I will continue to look out for in the future.  Grade: A+

Opinion: Will not play again unless someone is fanatical about playing it.

Played 5 times with 2, 3, & 4 players.

AUG 2010: It feels like a cross between several heavy Eurogames, but the wonderful interlocking mechanic systems work very well and make this game seem more than the sum of its parts. Very "German" in its design, it nevertheless has a lot going for it, and the addition of many different individual character type cards gives this game a little bit of flavor and tactical variability. I liked it much better than I expected, but believe it is too abstract and systemish to be a longtime favorite of mine. Still, great game for those who like this type. 

4th play: 7. 3p - Long time since last play, and this was a German copy. Still, fairly interesting, but very Euro. I want to play this a few more times to get a bit better at it, but the abstraction is strong in this one. Rather play Burgundy. 08/14
5th: 4. 2p - Too loose 2p, and I'm already tired of this game. Doesn't use dice as well as Castles of Burgundy.

A plan ahead game for sure.  12 quick rounds and it is over.  I really liked & want to play again.  Also want to own.  (The box was unexciting, but the board is inviting.)

If you're into specific action planning up to 6 turns in advance with a generous sprinkling of luck, then this is THE game for you!  It's a fairly heavy game that seems to take a little longer to play than your average Alea big box game.  It features the best dice mechanic I've seen yet, and I enjoyed this as much as I was hoping!.  There is a lot going on in this one - some may even say too much.  The 120 cards all with unique text and characteristics reminds me of the barrier that was broken with Agricola's multitude of cards.  In this game there aren't as many total cards as Agricola, but many more will come into play within each game, which means a fair bit of reading must be done by everyone.  As the players activate more and more cards, it's almost impossible to keep track of what players have which special abilities that influence what decisions which way.  This would probably make my list of "Top 5 games not to play with someone who suffers from heavy analysis-paralysis", but I think this game can be played reasonably well just going with instinct.  Some may gripe about the fact that the cardboard components aren't as sturdy as Carcassonne tiles, but I found the quality to be acceptable.  There is some significant luck in this one with the Tribute track and the way cards become available for acquisition, but much of the point of the game is about being ready for opportunities when they come.  I'm not sure that I've seen this much luck (some would even say chaos) combined with this depth of strategy and fiddliness in one game before.  Some may also complain about the lack of player interaction.  Basically the interaction boils down to claiming certain city spaces before others, claiming cards before others, and shipping specific goods before others, and there is nothing direct.  While it may sound like there are a number of potential negatives, I think this game is actually a LOT of fun.  I prefer playing with as few people as possible as it could get pretty long with 4, but it is time well spent.  It gives you lots of options, sets you up with specific dreams of what you can do, gives you significant tension and then rewards as you make your dreams a reality.  Don't let a casual gamer anywhere near this, but it's a very solid gamer's game if you don't mind the luck.

This was interesting. I can see it being playable several times, but it was a bit slow between action phases. The longest part of the game was the part where players chose what goods they wanted. The rest of the game went very quickly. It's a shipping game with a twist. It could get nasty, but all players had the same choice with the same values for goods each turn then they all took different role cards, got punished if they couldn't hold another role, and could activate cards at their discretion. The player that had played the game before won significantly, but it was still fairly close for the new players.

A dull cube management game that uses dice to produce cubes. It also features semi-random cards that you must take each turn and spend the randomly produced cubes on. With virtually no luck-mitigating elements, what you wind up with is a game where you think that your decisions actually have an effect but it really comes down to how lucky you got in matching up your random cubes with random cards.

RATING: 7
Macao is an odd beast of a game. On one hand it's a forward-planning cube conversion game with a strong strategic component, on the other it's a long string of random card flips and a dice bonanza.

That doesn't just sound like a weird combination, it also plays like one. Getting the proper resources at the right time is of paramount importance, and both the cards and the dice can throw one hell of a spanner in the works.

Maybe that means you need to approach the game from a different angle. With a bit of careful planning the most egregious punishments can usually be avoided. In typical Feld fashion that makes the game one of averting disaster rather than constructively building anything. If you look at it like this the game seems rather more manageable. It does seem, however, that if for some strange reason the dice do decide to align benevolently there can be huge windfalls for the lucky player. On the whole I'm still kind of undecided on whether the influence of the dice exceeds the leverage of the players themselves but until I find out Macao provides a very unusual challenge.

thinky Euro with alot of moving parts and non intuitive ways of getting points. very odd way of using dice, which generate future goods. Hard to explain simply, despite the overplayed medieval goods trading theme. 

Mechanisms are a bit too abstract and numerous, and ability to plan cards to build is very limited despite huge need to plan ahead. Card flips felt too random for how long and thinky the game is as a whole.  These factors made this game slip out of favor with my group, so I traded it away.

I like this game. It has interesting decisions a small but important bit of luck (dice rolls).

Feld presents a mish-mash of mechanics that don't feel integrated when you first play. By the end, I realized that was the beauty of the game. There were a number of ways to pursue victory here that you had quite a bit of freedom to decide your own path. Quite impressive for a Euro! The forward planning "windrose" mechanic threw me off until the middle of the game. By that time it was all coming together. Macao is a game that definitely needs a play to get the picture. I'm looking forward to trying this one again. Wanted to give it an '8', but the theme, disconnected mechanics and unnecessarily complicated rulebook sort of brought it down for me. I might pick this one up, though, if there's ever a decent reprint!

Excellent trading game by Stefan Feld with a unique "cubes plus compass rose" mechanic. The cards are hard to plan ahead for, but the game has the same addictive "so many things to do and too few resources to do them" feel as Feld's other gems like Trajan and Castles of Burgundy.

Wow, this is much more of a brain burner than I was expecting.  There are often many possible actions available and many opportunities for optimizing your strategy over multiple turns; this game is rife with opportunities for analysis paralysis.  Lots of paths to victory; strategies are likely to diverge over the course of the game as each player starts building up his unique set of cards.

Very interesting "plan ahead" mechanism.

Very prone to AP and demands laborious bit administration, and yet in the end, the winds of chance can decide one's fate.

As it is, the mechanics are trying to support a game heavier than they should.

The original dice based cube pusher? - players carry out actions which they must pay for with their available "cube" resources - you need to be able to pay the correct cost of each action in cubes (colour and number) - how many cubes you have is governed by a dice that determines both the number of cubes you recieve and how many turns into the future you get to use them - ouch! Actions earn gold and enhance abilities to maximise Vp each turn and at game end. Components are very good. Not a lot of player interaction - this is an efficiency/race game. Good fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Best game of Feld's I've played since Notre Dame. I like Notre Dame more I think as it comes across more polished and the theme fits better.

The planning with the dice, the Agricola-like desire to pick up some good card combos is by far the most fun of the game. The shipping of goods was less interesting, as was the purchase of districts. It's all about the wheel, cubes and cards! There is an advantage if you are randomly selected to start first. You essentially get first choice of cards twice before anyone can pay cubes to change the turn order. 

Still, an enjoyable game.

I like the dice mechanic. This game rewards those who can plan ahead. I liked it more than I thought I would. I need to get a couple more plays and I may move it up to a 7.5. The cards can be a bit confusing and I almost want to just get them into play to avoid negative points than try to get good synergies between cards. There is also a notable lack in player interaction. Other players' actions effect what you can do in terms of selling wares or connecting city quarters, however there is little to do when others are playing besides planning your next turn. Granted planning your next move requires a lot of thought.

Another great game by Feld (it's older than others I played before, but still newer to me). The gameplay is original, makes sense and it's still easy to grasp. It's amazingly fast for the depth of game it expresses. I really liked the planning mechanism , while I did not particularly care for the spatial elements (you build houses to get goods to sell, but you also care for adjacent houses, weird). The cards seem to offer a decent replayability.
I would play this over Castles of Burgundy with 4 players, but would probably still favour Castles with 3. It's very different from Bora Bora, but I believe I like this one better

Macao is a classic Alea game, an easy to explain and not very long game, that flows in a very nice way and offers quite many options. Average Alea components for a game that, without any praise or hype, is settled in the top 200. I think it deserves it. Macao is funny, is fast, is easy and the dice mechanics used are a novelty that I had never seen in any game till now. I really apreciate new designs and Macao is one of them. Although it uses dice, the mechanics create a game that is not luck dependent. It also has more interaction than you could expect at first sight. It lacks theme, and its a dry game that however works perfectly as a fast funny game. A bit under Burgundy and Troyes but still my third favourite dice game (and quite different to the other two).

Macao is an OOP game I was excited to play but fell short of my expectations. Some of my issues with the game:

-The wind rose, the card play, and the mini-games on the board all felt disjointed in a cobbled together kind of way. 
-The card draw is too random and swingy. 
-Going first is potentially too powerful due to the ways cards range in their extreme activation prices.
-Money is insanely tight.
-Buying points, building connected shipping houses, shipping goods, and planning out cubes for future actions ultimately made for boring game decisions.
-Too much set up and faffing about for what it amounts too.

These issues make the game feel much older than 2009. I think, by today's standards, this game would have gotten reworked quite a bit. A couple things that stand out in my mind that would be simple fixes:

-Give players income of 1 to 2 gold per round. Or,  give them one of those starting office cards that allows them to exchange 1 cube for 1 gold. Or, even better yet, allow players at any time to sell a certain amount of cubes for gold. 
-Separate cards into three "eras", something like what you see in Glen More, London, or a dozen other games. First era cards would help you get your engine up and running, second era cards would allow you to develop your strategy through specific abilities, and third era cards would give you really cool abilities but you'd only be able to possibly use them  in the last four rounds of the game.

Another Feld where I can honestly say: I'd rather play Rialto.

RATING: 7.5
Macao is, in many respects, just your standard "build a little personal economic engine and then churn victory points" type of Euro.  We've seen it all before a million times.  Well, almost.  Macao's one fascinating innovation is the numbered dial thingy that the rules call the "wind rose" but that I'm going to call the "Cube Chronometer."

Each turn someone rolls six standard dice, each a different color.  The players can each choose to use two of these six dice, with no restrictions regarding the other players' choices (you always have full choice among the six).  If I choose "green 1" and "black 5" I get one green cube and five black cubes.  But not immediately.  The cubes are placed beside the corresponding number of the Cube Chronometer, then the Cube Chronometer is rotated one position clockwise.  The arrow now points to the cubes that I have available this turn.  So the single green cube is available to me this turn, but I'll have to wait four more turns before using the five black cubes.

The cards you're trying to "build" require cubes in different numbers and color combinations, but - and this is very important - you're not allowed to store cubes between turns.  Use them or lose them.  So the game is a challenge of trying to get the right numbers of cubes in the right colors at the right times.  The dice don't always cooperate, and so you're constantly having to evaluate the odds and create contingency plans and rejigger your strategies.  The game requires a certain amount of planning, but the "perfect planner" type of player is likely to be frustrated here.  Also, Macao is mostly a parallel solitaire type of game.  There is some very important interaction, but most of the time you're playing in your own sandbox.

And that's what's keeping Macao from earning a higher rating from me. As the game progresses, I care less and less about what my opponents are doing in their sandboxes. They're messing about during their turn, doing a bunch of little micro-actions from their various card abilities. These little actions are hard for other players to keep track of, since they're written on tiny cards sitting in front of someone else. And honestly, the other players' little bags of tricks rarely affect me or matter to me. I usually just kind of tune them out and trust that they're doing it right. Playing with two or three players instead of four helps. So does playing with people who can execute their actions quickly.

I do also have some small complaints about a few of the cards*, but overall I do enjoy Macao and the strange type of inexact planning it requires.  For me, this is among Stefan Feld's best games, probably #3 behind Trajan and The Castles of Burgundy and ahead of In the Year of the Dragon.

* specifically, I think the cards that have more powerful effects in combination with another specifically-named card are a bad idea.  The deck is huge, so there's a high probability that the desired card won't even enter the game.  And there's no way to preview the cards in order to know whether the partner card will become available. Also many of the cards are imbalanced and tend toward degeneracy, but I view that as more of a feature than a bug; it increases the importance of the turn order "wall" and adds drama to the game by rewarding ambitious strategies.

This game is a little fiddly. There is a significant amount of luck in the card draw and dice rolls. The game is a gigantic snowball. On turns 1-4 you do almost nothing. In the last few turns you do so much it is hard to keep track of it all.

One play with four. The wind rose mechanism is great, but the hassle of getting cards off your tableau was more annoying than fun. It also seemed like a bit of a crapshoot as to whether you would ever be able to pull off a good combo. Meanwhile, there was a lot of down time while people figured out how to spend their cubes. It's never a good sign when people are routinely getting up and walking away from the table when it's not their turn.

All in all I thought it was just okay. I would play again, but I wouldn't request it.

The action point (cube) allowance system is unique. I really enjoy Macao. The mechanic of getting action cubes AND how the cards worked. It added pressure and choices. It's a cleverly designed game that's simple to explain and challenging to play. It has many different avenues to collect points with lots of tough, important choices. Do you use your cubes to move you ship closer to a port to deliver your goods, or do you use them to get further along the turn order wall or do you use them to take over a city quarter? Among all of these decisions, you have to choose whether you want less cubes now or more cubes later and have to keep your tableau moving as every card you acquire above 5 is a negative -3 points. Excellent depth and great fun!

None of my gaming friends liked it actually. Myself I am indifferent. There are some things to appreciate, like the action wheel,  on the other side it rewards careful planning. There is also too much luck in the money-victory point exchange rate. I just hoped it would be more fun, instead it felt a bit dry. Update: After my second game I rise the rating by 0.5. In the first game we messed up one rule, playing correctly helps enjoying the game.

Players rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track.

Players score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao. Whoever has the most points at the end of twelve rounds wins.

Rating should increase with more plays.  Still getting a good feel for the game.  So far, it seems too rushed and I think it would be a more interactive game with more players competing for ports, city quarters, and wall position.
---
Tried with 4 and the game didn't feel rushed at all.  In fact, it felt quite long (2-2.5 hours).  It was still a very fun experience, but now I'd like to try it with 3, to see if that's its sweet spot.
---
This is becoming my favourite 2 player game.  Just the right mix of randomness from the dice and cards (but I wouldn't call it "luck") and some good old fashioned brain burning strategy to make this a fantastic game.  
I would say it's best with 2 really since I don't think that competition for ports or city quarters adds much to the game.  A few more plays, and this one might become a 10!

Best with 3 because it increases the tension, but doesn't drag too long between turns. Easily one of my favourites and makes me want to try every single Feld design.

RATING: 8
This game adds a new and exciting mechanism which could be called "future action points management".  Players need to allocate action points for upcoming turns (at most 6 turns in advance) and they need to deal with 5 different types of action points.  In addition to that, in each turn you face a number of critical decisions: do I need few actions NOW or do I need many action points later?  And which types of action points do I need?  

Furthermore it has a very nice mechanism of "action cards" which are bought for action points and which can be combined to form powerful combos.

All in all an excellent game (not for the casual gamer, though).  Highly recommended!

I've played twice now, and find the game entertaining with some interesting choices. However, I'm not sold on the Wind Rose mechanism, as it adds perhaps too healthy a dose of luck to the proceedings. However, perhaps it is not luck, as I've won both games I've played!

RATING: 5.5
Interesting use of dice in the core mechanic: generating colored cubes that the players choose and place next to their personal wheels for use in future rounds.

However, there is too much luck in the cards available for draft each round, and being able to activate them depends on having the proper combination of cubes at any given time - which is not as easy as it seems, because all cubes allocated for the round must be spent. So, this activation process may take several rounds, and sometimes you can just hope for the best. Thankfully, the game offers other ways to spend cubes, but overall it doesn't feel very well balanced.

Besides, functionality could be better: as the card powers are simple and not very varied, icons should have been used instead of text. The game is also very ugly and abstract, but it flows reasonably well (at least with three players) and is maybe worth a few plays.

Solid and occasionally interesting. The dice mechanic is very nifty, even when you get hosed by the inability to make needed color combinations (1 each of 4 different colors? Really?), but the actual point-mongering vastly less so. I want the cool bits to be married to other, cooler bits. Also a bit too long considering the level of randomness.

"Első játék után hetes."
Sok kihagyás után jött el a második parti, majd a többi, s most jobban sikerült kiismerni és feljebb értékelni.

Tetszik:
- dobókocka-használat: véletlen és tervezés összhangjának megteremtése,
- erőforráskockák: többcélú felhasználás,
- kártyák variabilitása és általuk irányított nyerőpont vételi lehetőség.
Nehezen kezelendő teher lehet:
- kockadobálás: ha nem akar összejönni épületek ára,
- személy/épület pakli: tervezésgátló, hogy játékosszámtól függően a lapok 30-55%-a kerül csak játékba.

Nyelvfüggő. Mély. Hosszú, tán kissé unalmas. AP veszély adott, rengeteg dologra kell figyelni. Kissé pasziánsz jellegű.
A kinézete nem túl szép, a forgatós kockaszerző mechanizmus megvalósítása nem igazán tetszik, vaksi szemeimnek a kártyák szövegezése terhelő (ikonozás?).

RATING: 6.5
Nice dice mechanism combined with known stuff only. It´s a good game nonetheless, but the cards (luck of the draw) plus the dice is a bit too much for me. I really like the planning and how the dice are used, but getting the right cards can decide the game and you can do only so much about it.

My biggest complaint is the downtime, specially with people who are new to this game. About 75% of the game runs fast, but then everyone needs to read all the cards each round and plan ahead. It really kills it, sadly. May work better when the group knows the game, but that still leaves a bad taste.

I really rate this and can't understand it's low score. Worse than Thundestone? Please (EDIT: Now just above Thundestone - woohoo!). You have to start doubting the overall population at that stage... Everyone will understand what they're doing by half way through the first game of Macao and there is a great mix of a little luck, push your luck and rondel management. The theme is a obviously done to death (shipping! Yay!), but get past this and you'll find a deep yet fun game with multiple paths to victory and some clever mechanics.

Feels like several games stuck together. But I like them all and they interact in sensible ways. Game builds nicely, with simple early turns gradually becoming more complex through slow building of power combinations, keeping it all mentally managable through slow accretion. Some randomness, but eminently managable, will only rarely screw you. Works well 2 or 3 player. Dice and windrose are a genuinely innovative set of mechanisms, always nice to play games trying new things (and succeeding here)

I have no love for the golden oldies of the Alea line and I think the theme along with the box are just boring...

But the game shines like a small gem! It looks like it has the same old elements of every merchant-y eurogame in yet another combination, but after starting to play it you realize you've never played anything like it. You fight to get the resources for that huge building and finally manage to make it, just to understand that you could have done a dozen different and better things with the same effort. Drawing new cards is mostly negative instead of positive. Focusing on area control points you suddenly notice that you really want to use the ship instead because of the piling up of commodities...

It's like all these familiar elements are seen through the eyes of someone else and it makes everything fresh again! If it weren't for the "Siesta" in Havana, I would consider the "Idler" to be the best idea for a card ever. :)

Euro-style game with optimization and resource generation options via half dozen of dice (but same options for all players). Also fighting for initiative.

Card drafting, racing against the board, pick-up and deliver, turn order manipulation, hardcore cube pushing- it's got everything, and even more surprisingly it works. And in 12 turns, it neither outstays its welcome nor ever allows you to fully do what you want, making it rather addicting.

This euro basically has one very cool mechanic that is different than any I have seen before and works very well. It's enough to make me willing to play, but not enough to make it a favorite. I hope the idea of the turning compass is used somewhere else, becasue I would probably like that game more. The shipping just didn't do much for me here, nor did the actual buying of goods. I wished the compass was just used in conjunction with the buildings to get points.

RATING: 6
An interesting game from the maker of Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon.  There are definitely some similarities between all three of these games -- you have many types of commodities or categories which you are trying to balance, and you have to plan ahead a few turns to make sure that you don't get penalized due to running out of some commodity due to the inevitable upcoming events.

There is constant tension between the desire to acquire small numbers of goods cubes early (in order to activate cards from your tableau, to get the benefit of those cards as well as to avoid getting penalty points for taking a 6th card) vs. the desire to get large numbers of cubes in a much later turn (in order to activate more cards at once or to move your ship as far as possible, as well as to avoid getting penalty points for having no cubes in a turn).  Throw in the race to the front of the wall (to get the best cards that either give the best special power or cost the least to activate), the race to get a nice set of wares and a contiguous set of warehouses, and the race to get to the wares destinations first... there is a lot to keep track of!

I don't immediately see a winning strategy, especially since the card draws and dice rolls are so random.  I suppose that one should remain flexible, so that you can deal with the randomness.  I think that in the early game, getting to the front of the wall is pretty important, so as to get first pick of the early cards, whereas it isn't so important at the end of the game, when you might have more cubes to pay for more advanced cards, and when the cards can't be used for many turns (and hence are not as valuable).

It's important to note that on the last turn, you'll have to pick a new card, and if you don't have the cubes to activate it, you'll get a -3 penalty at the end of the game.  So it's important strategically to have a variety of cubes available in the last turn.

There are some rules (on the cards) which are unclear:
- Host+Pub = 3 GC per turn *combined*, not 6 GC/turn
- Baronesses: 3 PP for having one, 8 PP for having two, 15 PP for having all three
- Crane/Healer/Archive: *each* Building/Person/Office card (respectively) costs 1 less AC to activate, not just one activation per turn

========

At times, I really dislike this game... it's because of the ridiculous dice rolls, which can be very unbalanced.  You could say that everybody is facing the same dice, but everybody has selected different dice in past, and has different future requirements on the cards they selected (and those selections were made based on a guess of what was going to come).  So bad dice rolls can cause you to lose the game.

Though I enjoyed the game, no one else did. The need to coordinate the combinations of action-cubes around the rondel (when the availability of those cubes depends on dice) proved too much of a strain.
Still - a solid offering from S. Feld, one of my favorite designers.

RATING: 6
Not for the faint of heart!  An (Action) Cube management game!

It can be quite challenging to plan for the activation of cards when you have no control when, nor how many, cubes of the right color will come out!

Single color cards are easier to plan for, two colors doable but more difficult, but 3 and 4 colors?  You really need to plan 5-6 turns ahead for those, and hope the right numbered dies come up, or you have a Joker token or have already activated card(s) which provide you with a cube of the needed color(s).

With this said, it is possible to, or should I say necessary, to go for card combos.  And there are many possibilities.

Not all cards will come up during a game, so there is a lot of replay value.  At the same time, there is a fair amount of randomness (cards, action cube die rolls), which is somewhat mitigated by the fact that there are more than one copy of a card, albeit with different resource costs.  Further, there are always 2 extra cards during the card selection phase, so even the last player will have a choice out of 3 cards.

All in all an interesting game, but somewhat of a brain burner when it comes to planning ahead.

Far from perfect: the luck factor is HUGE, as is the solitaire feeling. You can't do many things untill mid-game and end-game is a chaos. Theoretically the tableau building is the heart of the game but the cards come ramdomly and is hard to build any real strategy. Yet if you're lucky some combos are hard to catch up. Anyway, for some reason I enjoy matching cube colors -that's actually what the game is about.

This is an excellent Stefan Feld game, and comes highly recommended for the elegance of design and the thinking requirement designed into the base game play.

I loved how Players needed to make card choices, which guided their action cube selection, which guided their activities and abilities.  This is as hard to balance as all those choices in In The Year of the Dragon, but somehow seems a little easier to accomplish here, which I liked very much.

This is a game that really gets it right- interaction, strategy and planning, grabbing the moment, avoiding penalties are all key to success.  I'm starting this at a 7.5 after (2) solo 4-player games; I think could easily advance to my personal top 25 with a few more plays.

Egyik kedvenc Feld játékom. Tetszik, hogy a kockadobások határozzák meg a nyersanyagok számát és mivel csak egy kockadobás van, mindenkinek ugyanabból a lehetőségből kell a legjobbat kihozni. A kártyák nagyon jók lennének, ha tudnánk őket használni. Sajnos azok a kártyák, amelyekhez többféle nyersanyag kell a leépítéshez nagyon nehezen építhetők le, általában csak a játék vége felé és akkor már alig tudjuk kihasználni. Egyes kártyák nagyon jól kombinálhatók egymással, de semmilyen garancia sincs arra, hogy azok feljönnek. Több játékosnál már fontos a sorrend, hogy minél előbb tudjunk a kártyák közül választani. 
Sajnos a kártyák miatt erősen nyelvfüggő. Megcsináltam hozzájuk a magyar fordítást és kártyavédőbe be van rakva. Nem túl elegáns, viszont teljesen jól használható.

RATING: 8
This game is difficult to play well.  You must cope with a large amount of hidden information: you don't know what the dice rolls or building choices will be.  You must develop as many options as possible early, and then pounce on the best opportunities that present themselves later.  There are a number of different building powers with distinct powers, and certain buildings work well with others.  However, you have relatively little control over which buildings you can active, and when you can do so.  Therefore, you must develop your strategy as you play.

Dumb luck could be a factor if you can get a powerful building out early due to dice rolling, but more likely careful planning will earn the victory.

It is difficult to keep track of what other players are doing the first time you play.  They have a variety of colored cubes in many locations, several cards with a variety of colors and powers described in tiny text, a ship moving about with a variety of goods, a turn order marker they can move, and growing district control of the city.  So, it is tempting to play this game "heads down" so to avoid information overload.  However, you can't really win this way unless everyone is doing so.

It's got this Castle of Burgundy vibe going for it--the use of dice to determine action-related choices each round, and the grinding halt of play when it's not your turn. Early on the turns move very quickly, as you only have a few actions available, so they will most likely be spent on acquiring one tile or (if you're lucky) building a building. But by the last few rounds, you'll have 8+ buildings that can possibly be activated once each, a ton of cubes to spend, etc, so each turn will take quite a while.

Planning is kind of mandatory in this game; if you do not have any action cubes to use in a round, you receive a -3 pt penalty. Likewise, each round you must take a [building] card, but you can only hold 5, so if you are full, you must take a -3 penalty and then throw away a card. If you can't build your buildings, you can imagine the penalties will pile up quite quickly. It can be kind of stressful if what you need doesn't turn up (and the fact that you'll have to wait X turns to get X cubes), but since it is happening to everyone, the penalty is at least a wash if it smacks everyone.

There is a push-your-luck element in the resource acquisition phase (do you grab more resource that will be available in the future or fewer resources that will be available sooner).  There is also an engine building element in selecting cards that work well together and build a better VP creating engine.  There are multiple paths to victory involving privilege, shipping and real-estate.

An Alea game with dice?! Actually this is a very clever game, although it's as frustrating as hell trying to get the cubes you want and getting the combos needed for the fancier cards is very much in the lap of the gods. Although I think this is Alea's best release for a while, it's very much a Stefan Feld game, you're pulled in lots of directions at once, there are penalties everywhere and it's as dry as dust.

This is a really clever game that hates you, as Stefan Feld games are wont to do.  It's about managing cubes and getting the right ones at the right time, but it's also about planning out when that will be and manipulating the game so that you have what you need when you need it.  But at the same time, there are also several other things you need to take care of, if you don't want the game to punish you.  I enjoy this sort of thing quite a bit, and Macao pulls it off very well.  Good stuff. (1 play)

Okay, they totally fucked up the translation of this game.  I mean, to the point that it's just not fun to have to guess what the cards are meant to do.

*If* they re-release it without such stupid errors, then I would consider trying it again.

The actual game seems pretty solid.  I don't quite like how stuttery the turns are.  It doesn't flow smoothly like Puerto Rico for example.  Each player will end up taking 1-2 minutes of min/maxing on their turn during the heavy turns.

The windrose is cute and all, but just doesn't make up for the horrible translation work.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

Macau is definitely my favorite of Stefan Feld's earlier games and I have a little trouble figuring out why. I think it might be because this is his first game that combines several mechanically different scoring mechanisms. The cube allocation based on dice rolls, area control in the city that combines with point scoring resources, and the card play that adds enough randomness to each turn that it keeps you guessing. 

The cards are a double-edged sword in a two-player game however as there is too much unbalance depending on the luck of the draw. Cards you are hoping for when setting up a points engine or need for set collection, might be removed from play. This could cause your winning strategy to fall flat. 

Overall it's a classic that I love, one that manages to make every cube feel meaningful. However it falls short of true Feld greatness because of the randomness of the cards.

Tried with 2, 3 and 4 players. Macao is totally themeless, but the mechanics alone are sufficient to make this an interesting game. Resource management (of many little cubes) is at the heart of Macao. The coloured-die-rolling mechanism that constrains player decisions on which cubes are available and when, combined with the requirement to pay for many cards with multiple colours of cubes establishes a healthy tension in the game. The tension is further ratcheted up by the races to buy cheap city quarters and to sell wares first at the ports. Perhaps the only aspect of the game which does not seem to work as well as it could is the card drawing: much can turn on which cards come up and when. But, perhaps greater familiarity with card deck would make this less of a concern.

To call this game dry, long and themeless is to denigrate a decade of dry, long and themeless games that have come from German publishers.  

The dice mechanic is clever and worth a look, it just deserves to be encompassed in a better game.  

Then there is the physical production.  The English translation of the rules and components is so spotty it hard to believe this made it past Rio Grande.  You will spend an inordinate amount of time squinting.  And the "map" is a ludicrous abstraction.  Additionally the turning mechanism which is a critical component is a bit fiddly and not well thought out.

This was a real miss for me.

Generally I hate Feld games.  But this one (along with 'In the Year of the Dragon' (which I highly value) and 'Notre Dame') didn't trigger negative emotions for me.

It's a playable game, possibly too solitaire and with complex choices towards the end.  The last issue makes it too long.

As for Feld it's a decent game.

I'd have to play more to form a final opinion.

Finally just played this in 2013 after waiting a long time. I am currently burnt out on Euros, had I played it 3 or more years ago my rating would likely be a point higher or so, 8 for sure anyway.  

Even now though, I think its pretty good; planning is pretty important, tactical choices provide angst in a few ways, the number of cards and random good setup should provide replay, should scale decent, moves along at a fair clip, can play in 90 mins or so and a few ways to score and even approach the game it would seem.  Luck plays a role here, and it might be a tad high actually this time as which cards come out is random of course but the order is important too, you can fight for turn order only to have all crappy cards come out.  The dice rolls effect everyone but you can also get burned here, overall I think the luck is close to okay but maybe a tad high, and after 5 games or so with the same players is where the “tad” might matter.  

I have not played Burgundy, Trajan or his 2013 games which look to be good, but out of the others I think I would put this in the middle somewhere or a little above.  Its missing a strong theme (there is one here I think just not that strong) and the true angst that can come from crisis management to be close to as good as ITYOTD for me, that is still his best game in my mind, it pretty much has it all.

Nope. Yet another Feld design I just do not get!

At least no one else I play has understood it yet so it is still a luck-fest as far as we are concerned.

The way the dice give you actions in this game makes it almost impossible to make too much of a plan. I felt like I had very little control. That said some of the cards were really cool and helped even out the action cubes you get from dice. The game definitely has some interesting ideas and it was sort of fun, but it didn't really blow me away or live up to what I expect out of a Stefan Feld game.

Like Yspahan and Alea Iacta Est, another interesting dice mechanism, this time combined with roundels.  All three of these games also have a fixed number of rounds which is nice.

Just notched up my rating a little higher again after my now 4th play.  All 4 player games so far, would like to try with 3, and maybe even with 2.  I won on my last 3 plays and am always amazed as things look dire at times and doesn't start coming together til late game.

RATING: 5
Played one game and probably won't be playing another. Mechanically somewhat sound, but at the same time themeless, soulless and just plain boring. Also too long for what it is. Lots of fiddly cube pushing in the final turns. The game masquerades as an economic engine game, but it really isn't one, since the resources you get as income (action cubes) are both random and transient. Components are appropriately boring, non-descript, and hard to read.

I actually liked the dice/action cube allocation mechanism a lot, at least the idea of choosing between getting few resources now, or many later on. However, being coupled with the need to be able to combine specific colors on the same turn, the system falls down flat and makes planning almost impossible. The system of getting harsh penalties for not activating your cards actually just seems to serve to straightjacket people into playing the game the way the designer envisioned. *Having* to take cards, and having to activate them in order to avoid crippling penalties just seems stupid, both mechanically and thematically.

I have never been a big fan of Stefan Feld's designs, and this game fits right in with most of the other ones: Thematically weak beyond belief, procedural, dry. As long as alea seems to favor his games, they're a lost cause as far as I am concerned...

Another awesome Feld point salad. So many tough decisions in this one! How far will you plan ahead? Is it worth taking a certain card that will be hard to pay for, or will you stick with the mono-colored ones? Quietly attractive board. Mean but easily avoidable punishment mechanisms. Love this one.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2012)

It’s been a long time since I played Macao. I remember I didn’t like it and it disappointed me, and from my comments, the game has a lot of downtime, even with three players. I remember I liked the dice and rondel mechanic. It’s possible the game explainer made some rules mistakes, also I have liked most Feld games so I’m willing to play again soon. When I do I will come back and re comment.

I finally played Macao again and this time I liked it :D. The friend who explained it last time made at least 3 mistakes with the rules but this time we played it correctly. This friend was the same that explained Notre Dame to me and it that game he also made big mistake. Nowadays, I no longer pay attention to his explanations :D, I love him dearly, but he can´t explain!

The rules aren´t very complex, you can explain them under 15 minutes. Playtime can be long with four players, so I think it is best as a three player game.

The game´s components and art are adequate, but nothing too exciting.

The theme is barely there, but that never stops me from linking a good Euro game.

As any good Feld, Macao offers very interesting decisions (which cards to activate and when, which dice to take, should I buy VPs, should I claim a district? Should I navigate? Should I advance in the wall?). 

Also, as mot Felds, it has some elements that create pressure, in Macao´s case, you are forced every turn to get a card and if you don´t play it you get penalized. I really like this feature. I also like how the wind roses and dice work, they allow you to plan ahead. 

There is considerable luck in the game, with the cards and with the dice, but the idea is to adapt as best as you can to the current circumstances, so it doesn’t bother me much. The luck of the dice affect all players the same, so it is fair. The luck of the cards can be an issue for me, I need to play more times to see. I also need to verify the power level of the cards, but so far it seems the game has many paths to victory.

Reading from the cards is sometimes confusing, I think the English translation is regular in some cases.

Bottom line, Macao is a borderline 7.0 to me, that is, Macao is a good game. I need to play it more times to see if the game is keeper for me (I think it will be) and I also need to try it with Amy. It offers really interesting decisions and the mechanism of getting resources is unique among the games I have.

One of 2009´s favorites.

RATING: 8
Macao is intensely chaotic but also egalitarian in a very Euro way - the action cube "income" choices are wildly divergent but offered to all players equally to make the best of as they can.  I'm not aware of this type of chaos having been implemented in quite the same way elsewhere.  Yspahan is probably the closest but then gives a huge advantage to the player who happens to be first on particular turns.  Everyone has access to the same action cubes in Macao, so if you can't manage them as well as the other players it's hard to blame the dice for that - though there is a little risk management in the selection of cards.

The theme is stapled on, of course, but the game mechanics are so innovative I'm not sure how much I care about that.  Time will tell whether Macao's shine will wear off after a few plays, or whether this game of Euro wave-riding will have staying power.

Brain burning in a good way.  Random?  Yes, but since all of the random effects every player in the same way (in the form of card availability and resource cube allocation), there is quite a bit of skill in managing the vagaries of "luck."  Even while this game is kicking your butt, you're loving the ride.

Definitely one of my favorite games, comes of the shelf regularly.  I love that there is no direct conflict between players, although there is still a race to collect and deliver goods, the fun is in the puzzle of what cubes to collect. After rolling all the dice you get to choose any two.... but there is a catch!! the color of the dice you choose will be the color of the cubes you get, and the number on the dice is how many you will receive; sounds good right!!!
but the number also depicts how many rounds will pass before you get to use them!!!  
Take a low amount of cubes to use right away to get a card out or stock up for later and play the long game... I have tried many different strategies and they have all been satisfying.

Mr. Feld certainly enjoys dealing out pain in his games. This time he does it with cards and your ability to put them into play.

The game makes good use of dice by allowing you to decide what resources you would like to have available to you as a result of the dice rolled. Once resources are taken you decide how best to use them. Similar to Notre Dame my initial play I focused on minimizing the pain by playing cards but that's not where the points are. You really need to look towards gaining a presence in the city and delivering commodities to distant lands.

Being aware of what your opponents can do and when they can do it is important since it's easy to get cut out of something you want if you are not careful.

RATING: 8
Macao is a strategic dice game with a cool mix of mechanics that will be hard for me to describe. Every turn, dice of six different colors are rolled. Each color corresponds to a different color "action cube" and the number rolled indicates the number of cubes you get and the number of turns it will be until you get them. So if the red die rolls a 4, and you pick it as one of the two dice you get to select, then you set aside 4 red cubes to use 4 turns in the future. You use the cubes to do a number of things - purchase cards that give you bonuses or points, purchase buildings on the board that give you goods, move your ship to where you can trade the goods, and so on. It's hard to say how much control you have in the game. The dice are random, but you select which to use and how far in the future to place them. The cubes you previously selected determine your choices in the present turn. It's like no other game I've played and it is one of those games where you say, "How the fudge do designers create something this intricate and yet so balanced and playable?" Very impressed.

Definitely felt like a Feld game, with the tightly interlocked moving parts, and the turn order "walk-way".  The new thing here is the "wind rose," where you use dice to allocate resources up to 6 turns ahead of time.  This is the mechanism that makes the game interesting; really, without this, it wouldn't stand out from the rest of the Euro crowd.  In my first play there felt like a lot of luck was involved, but it will take more plays to see if this is too much luck for me.  Also, although the mechanism is fun and interesting at the beginning and middle of the game, I wasn't satisfied with how it was integrated into the endgame.

Yspahan crossed with Duck Dealer, with lots of tiny card synergies thrown in to make turns even more over-the-top. 

The mechanisms in this game have to be seen to be believed. I hope Stefan Feld is laughing at us. Sadly, it's probably not meant to be funny. Basically what you are doing is using dice to strategically draft six varieties of action points while also managing your next six turns. 

Let me repeat that. Six types of action points. Drafted using dice. Allocated for future use spread over six turns. WTF? You then use the action points to purchase cards (that you've already drafted). The cards mostly involve squeezing extra action points and gold coins. You need the cards to get some cash flow going, so that you can consistently buy points to outpace your opponents. The action points may also be used to purchase goods and to move a ship around to deliver goods. The game also hands out "punishment" tokens if you make the slightest misstep. Gee, where have I seen that before? 

Not a bad game, but certainly it cuts close to parody the way Ystari's games have done in the past. This game needs to try a lot harder on the theme; it seems like a lot of potential there was wasted. 

I would give this another try or two. Doubtful that it has legs for me.

My hard-core, round-the-clock gaming buddies and I love Macao. There are more mechanics here than a crooked dealers school but they are clever and work well together. A rich card deck that you only see a third of in any given game makes for tremendous replayability. Might be the best Euro overall for balance of luck and skill, long range strategic thinking, variety, and most of all, fun!

After three more plays (2-player) I'm bumping it down two notches!
Both me and my wife feels this is becomeing more and more irritating...
We're done with this as a two-player game, but I can definately try it with 3 or 4 if the opportunity arises.

***
Bumping it up from 7 to 8. This still has a "Solitaire-feeling" to it - not much interaction, but I do enjoy the fact that the cards add a lot óf variation to the strategies. I like the ramdomness of having to choose to get many action cubes (and not know what to do with them) or choose few action cubes (and know exactly what you want to do with them.) I would suggest to do simultaneous actions exept for the sailing and area tile picking, otherwise ther is a lot of down-tie in this game. 
***
A neat little game.
I very much enjoy the compass and the mechanics for aquisition of Action Cubes. After the first play I get the feeling that there is too much cards. It's also a little annoying that the cards come up in an arbitrary order, wich makes it difficult to form a strategy based on the cards. I don't mind some randomness in games, but this one feels a litte wrong. Nevertheless, this is a good game that I will try some more. (BTW, my wife enjoyed it a lot, so I guess it's inevitable...)

I rate this a 9 with two players, but only 8 with more.

This game is generally very good, but absolutely phenomenal with two! The game can tend to drag a little with more players when it's harder to plan ahead and more analysis is needed during your turn. This reduces as people become more familiar with the game but it is a pretty thinky game and depending on the group it can make 4 player games a bit too long.

The mechanics and design are very good, the planning and resource management is very tight and rewarding.

An innovative use of dice and rondelles lead to a unique feeling game. An overwhelming number of cards however, tends to cause some apprehension with some of the other players. I have a feeling that the more familiar these people get with the cards, the more comfortable they'll be playing it.

Fast forward; game traded. In the end, the abundance of cards is what killed it. Too many things going on that are only tenuously related to each other. The dice mechanic is excellent, but is not enough to carry the rest.

Macao scales astonishingly well across the full player count, i.e. one of the few Aleas that can be recommended already for 2 players. Be warned though that with 4 players prone to AP, this will get annoying as players can plan a lot on their turn. The unique turning wheel cube allocation mechanic allows planning up to 6 turns in advance in a 12 turn game. In the action round things don't get easier as the same cubes can be used for multiple purposes: shipping, building, turn order, card activations. Dubbed the prototypical JASE by some, I must say that I enjoy it. JASE wouldn't be a negative attribute if all JASEs were like Macao. The length of player moves keeps it from an 8, at least for now.

I've only played it once so far, but it was a really good game. One of the most ingenious mechanisms I've seen in a game

A lot of the scoring mechanisms and multifaceted decisions are on-par with the standard Stefan Feld experience, but it's the catalyst of Stefan Feld's games of how you make those decision that sets them so far apart. MaCao is no exception to that, and I found it to be one of the most clever systems. The wind rose system provides a system full of tactics, strategy, and an even an element of luck with divergent paths among players. I've never seen anything like it before.

Initial few rounds of the game is basically planning, plays fast and quite boring. The windrose mechanism is unique. Tried with 4 players and it feels more random, each does it own planning. 2 players feels more challenging and the need to block.

I wanted to like this a lot more than I did.  The Alea pedigree is the first reason.  Secondly, Stefan Feld has a fairly decent track record (Rum & Pirates and In the Name of the Rose notwithstanding) with me.  I don't even really care too much about the boring and overused theme.

I like the rotating windrose mechanism - it is clever and produces some interesting choices.  However, I feel quite frustrated while playing the game.  I realize that a good chunk of this is due to my playing style (I'm not really a planner) and probably inexperience with the game.  I'm not going to say that luck is too dominant either.  It definitely does play a minor role, but everyone still has to make do with the same dice rolls.  

So my frustration lies in the absurd number and variety of cards.  I don't know what I can do but it is difficult to achieve card synergy in the first place, and even when you do, it is very hard to get the more expensive cards out in time to make those expensive cards pay off.  I also tend to not like games with megaturns where you do a whole bunch of stuff with different cards.  I think it is best done simultaneously if possible (like in Loyang), since a slow player will more rapidly drain the fun out of games like these.  However, I have not yet experienced the ultralong games that some have mentioned.  1.5 hours is about right, though I probably would enjoy this more if it came in under an hour.

I will probably try and play this a couple more times, maybe 2 player with my wife, before I decide the game's fate.

Only played once and not sure how well it would hold up over repeated plays. But very nice.

What's awesome about the game is how difficult it can be to play your cards. The necessity to plan several resource combinations to show up on the same turn can be rough.

The tile gathering and sailing was ok but yeah, the game is strong thanks to the rondell/resource gathering in combination with the cards.
It has an element of luck that can be very punishing without feeling unfair. It's just... you pushed it. You got cocky and now have to pay for it :p

Excellent game!  The central mechanism -- few goods soon vs. many goods in the future -- is very fresh.  Every game is different depending on the cards that happen to come out, but you can pick from them to try to make some synergy.  And, of course, you don't just get them, you need to line up the right cubes to "activate" them some time in the future.
I also especially like the way that buying a city space combines 3 different considerations into one simple action: what is the cost, which good does it get you, and how does it help you make a long connected line of city spaces.

Fundamentally a good to very good game.  

Interesting use of dice in a Euro to allocate future resources.

There are three annoying/weird things.
The rules translation is annoying and it is very tempting to rewrite it to make more sense in English.

Thematically the fact that you can acquire goods after your ship has set sail and still sell them at their destination port is interesting.

The goods are pictured, but then referenced on some cards by name with no details of which picture matches which description.  Most of the time you can work it out, but how hard would it have been to put the picture of the goods item on the card that matched the tile and the board which only use the graphic image???

Rant over.  Yes these things are irritating, but do not spoil the game or my willingness to replay it.

I wanted to like this one, but glad I played before I bought it.  There are just too many things I didn't like about it.  One, it seems like the kind of game that should take an hour or 90 minutes. Instead, our three player game took 2.5 hours.  I realize with multiple plays, playing time would decrease but it was just too long for what it was.  The biggest thing is it wants to be a game about long term planning.  But since you have no idea what cards are going to come out it's pretty much impossible.  You just roll the dice and pick the best cubes and hope for the best when the cards come.  Yes, you could take other routes for VP, but the cards are such an integral part of the game.  If you ignore them, you will lose too many points.  So the game forces you to pay attention to cards, then throws them at you randomly each turn.  

I think a good variant and one I'd be willing to try is to draft 10 cards pregame (ala Agricola) or even pass them out randomly.  Then you could see your handful of cards and plan accordingly.  Then the dice rolls wouldn't be as devastating when they didn't quite go your way because you could adjust strategies on the fly. 

In my play, I paid little attention to the turn order track and it hurt me, but I am not sure how badly.  One I got a card where I needed just one white cube to activate the gunner (one GP every turn you're last on the turn order track) but in four straight rolls I couldn't get white it where I needed it.  I should have gone another route to get that elusive cube but being new to the game I didn't think to.

I feel this could be a good game and I imagine my rating would go up with multiple plays.  But it feels like one I'd rather play against strong computer AI than against live opponents.  It would be fun to try different strategies and routes to victory. As it is, the game just takes too long and isn't enough fun to want to pull it out over and over.

First play started promisingly.  But as the game went on, and on, I experienced fatigue.  2.5 hours is far too long.

Comparison to Le Havre, where I should read all the cards all around the table, if I am going to try to play well.  And comparison to Tikal, where I may as not bother looking until it is my turn, as I cannot make any final strategy plans until my turn begin.

Obviously I was not impressed.

A Top 10 game for me.  Macao is all about developing a plan from the random stuff that the game and your opponents give you.  There's a freaking brilliant little resource wheel in the game that makes you choose between getting a little of what you want right now and a lot of what you want later.  Altogether, it's fun and tense and just a really incredible game.

Very neat and original mechanic.  A few cubes now, or many cubes later, and try to get them all to line up.  There are clearly combos in the game, and if you get some set up you will demolish those that had the misfortune of not being able to successfully put together a combo of their own.

...or maybe not.  I honestly haven't played this enough to tell.  Either way, a very nice mix of short term tactical considerations alongside almost gamelong strategic decisions.  Very well designed game.

I liked Macao at first, but then it started to feel really restrictive. The strategies are all balanced, so the winner is the person who finds the most synergy with cards and with actions on the board. Sometimes its possible to find synergy easily, sometimes is really just not possible at all. This started to feel a little random. The wind rose is a little too random in that sometimes you need to build a particular card, but the colors simply never line up right, despite you checking for the possibility every turn. Its a good game, if you like Feld you will enjoy it. I'm starting to get a little annoyed with Feld games that require you to plan ahead but then wait for the randomness to allow you to enact your plan, because he usually doesn't give you a way to get around the randomness. Bruges had the same problem for me.

(Almost) Multiplayer solitaire, where only couple of minor things need to be checked in action phase - otherwise everyone can play in a same time (which reduces the time a lot). This game is a full of different kind of action cards which is the element I don't like. But still - and this was a surprise for me - Macao works nicely and I really like it. One of the biggest positive thing about this game is the unique use of dice. You just can't do what ever you want, because it's hard/impossible to get right kind of cube mix in a right time. And that's the problem which every player has to solve and in every round. 

I'm glad that I have the (finnish) summary of the cards which shows which cards you can use multiple times in a round - now there is no problems to solve how and when different cards works (or won't work).

Macao works better with 3 than with 4, but it isn't that bad with 4 either.

Played once, 4p.  Major problem with this game is - it's not a 4p game.  I think this might be a really good 3p game, but in 4p, the fight for turn order becomes all consuming.  Perhaps that's fine, but if each game boils down to that one mechanism, make a game about that only.  I will admit, that criticism is based on one game, but the bottom line is, I did not enjoy my single game because of it.

A Feld's worthy game that's more tactical than usual for him.  Analysis & planning is still possible to a point but is hard.  In that sense it feels a bit like Merkator from Rosenberg but the rewards for analyzing are shallower.  Card text translation is lacking, so read the forums cause there is no FAQ!?!  The rondel cube gathering mechanic is really novel and interesting but ultimately not ground breaking.  It's hard to really screw up and the final scores are generally very close unless someone *really* plays abysmally (very unlike YOTD).  So there is more chance & serendipity involved than in other Feld's game and it's hard to feel firmly in control of your game but it still make for meaningful & satisfying play.  Worth playing to see if it works for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a progressive build-up game.  Turns are quicker early in the game and much longer later on in the late rounds as you have more cards already built for use.  It probably has a one-game learning curve as newbies need to get accustomed to planning ahead for large cube collections while managing to have (a) at least a cube for next round and (b) to build on average of, at least, two cards every three rounds.  1:1 ratio would be ideal, of course.  It's one of those a "punishment" games where you need to plan well enough.  (I tend to like In The Year Of The Dragon, Notre Dame and Pillars of the Earth, better b/c they have less of a punishment factor and it takes less time for me to plan/think/analyze.)

RATING: 7
While I thought this was an interesting game, some of my fellow gamers felt less inclined to enjoy the game.  This game is primarily tactical in nature with a little of forward planning but forward planning is often dependent on a finicky dice roll.  Dice are used to determine what goods come out when in the game (you choose two of the dice/goods and put that quantity that many turns ahead).  Cards are central to doing well - if you can cause synergy to occur, the game will flow more easily.  I am curious to see how many different strategies are successful in this game - there are numerous ways to score points between delivering wares, buying VPs based on the 6 card draw of people/office/places cards, and those action cards themselves as well as longest connected network of quarters in the town.

Picked this up cheap a while ago, but it never made it to the table.
The more I looked at it, and the more other Feld's I played, the more sceptical I was about it. I almost traded it away a couple of times.
I finally played it recently and it's actually pretty good. Yes, it's dry to the point of being anhydrous, but it's not as unthematic as Notre Dame for example (which I hate with a passion) and there are some interesting mechanisms in there. 
It does feel a bit "old school", but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Very strong Euro game.  The windrose mechanism is absolutely unique and drives the game's strategic choices in a very interesting way.  Die rolls and card draws add just enough luck to prevent the game from becoming too heavy.  There seem to be several good overall strategic options to pursue.

We got a copy of [thing=55670][/thing] from our very generous Secret Santa. We had been intrigued by the game and were eager to try it, as we had been looking for a "bigger" game for a while. The game has a lot of familiar things going on (area control, resource acquisition, shipping) that are glued together using the unique dice rose mechanism. The other selling point are the hundreds of cards that can give you access to unique abilities. We've generally enjoyed games with lots of cards, so we thought this would be a sure thing. The theme is almost ridiculously generic (just what are these cubes?), but the I wonder if the dice mechanism pays homage to the real life Macao as a gambling center.

In practice, the dice mechanism really constrains the action. It's almost like having to manage a harvest in [thing=31260][/thing] every turn (and is apparently a trademark of Feld's games, of which this is the first we've played). Since you have to allocate the dice rolls for every turn, the game doesn't feel like it has a natural buildup to it--instead, it feels more like a roller coaster where you stock up dice on a certain turn, hit the jackpot and do all your actions, and then wait again. Or maybe we just need to learn the game better---the first game, my wife hated it, but the second game she warmed up to it.  After another game, she really liked it!  After playing the game more, we've been able to use the cards to help mitigate the dice rolls more effectively. For us, it feels like another entry into the "more complicated [thing=3076][/thing]" niche, giving a similar vibe to [thing=30380][/thing], but working better with two players.

Stefan Feld's latest for the alea big box line, Macao, is an interesting game with a somewhat odd structure, and a novel resource management system. While I enjoyed playing, it's a little clunky for reasons I'll get into momentarily, I probably won't buy it for myself, but I'd happily play a friend's copy. I may even give it as a gift to someone I knew would enjoy it.

The most interesting part of Macao is how resources (called action cubes here, since you can use them for more than just buying things) are generated. A mittful of six-siders are rolled part way into each round, each die a different colour. Players choose two dice (and more than one player can choose the same die, which speeds things up a lot), collecting a number of cubes of the die's colour equal to the number rolled on that die. The kicker is, the more cubes you get, the longer you have to wait until you can use them. I think this is a very good resource distribution mechanic, and one which I expect will get used in another game or two (with some twists) in the future.

The problem, for me, lies in how the rest of the systems are largely unconnected to each other. While everything feeds off the action cubes (except for direct purchase of VPs, and even then you usually base gold income from using cubes) Even the cards largely concern resource management and each other, with only a couple that I saw affecting goods & shipping. The only use for gold is to buy lots of VPs (which are set up by a cool mechanic, but sit off in their own little corner). The wall affects turn order, but only a couple of cards, and nothing else, feed back into it. Had the different segments of the game affected each other more directly, the game would feel much more cohesive and less like a sprawling beast.

There is also some issue about how much you can plan in Macao versus being at the mercy of the dice. I actually don't think this is as much of a problem as some commentators, but it can be a bit tricky to figure it all out. In many ways, the planning is a lot like Race for the Galaxy or San Juan: see what you get early and then develop your plan around that, including trying to coordinate cubes so you can bring your buildings out in a timely fashion. I can see how this kind of reactive planning may not be to everyone's taste, though, and adding the purchase of quarters and shipping of goods to this can be a mite overwhelming the first couple times you play.

I think Macao is worth a try for everyone. It's got a bit of strategy, it's got a bit of tactics and it's got a little dice-rolling. When you get down to it, that's a huge chunk of gaming right there. While I rate it a 7 now, there is potential for that moving up with experience, and a better understanding of how to put everything together.

RATING: 4
The idea of getting less action cubes sooner or more cubes later is pretty cool, but the penalty for not having cubes each round makes it less so in execution. I wish they had instead made it so you have stuff that makes taking less cubes earlier potentially more profitable if you can use them to set up a card engine sooner. Speaking of the cards, I really don't like them. They are all pretty situational, and while you can build an engine with them it feels the other half ofthe time you are just getting rid of them to avoid the penalty for having too many. The rest of the game is a cacophony of thematically boring different scoring methods, ranging from the not too shabby race to deliver goods first to the awful gold to points conversion that adds fiddliness for something that adds about one important decision (gold converts usually at about a 1 to 2 ratio to points, but do I need to start taking worse conversions since otherwise the game will end before I can convert them all?).

I didn't like my first play. The second play (a couple of years later) was much better. I still think that randomness is too rampant without many mechanisms to mitigate it (which cards you get, which cubes you get). Still, certainly different from most games and probably worth a play.

I wouldn't be surprised that if once I learn the cards (assuming I play it more), it grows on me and joins the ranks of other Felds like ItYotD or Notre Dame.

There may or may not be to much randomness in the cube generation. I do love the wind rose mechanism, and there are tons of ways to spend the cubes to make points, so in the long run these option might serve to mitigate my feelings about the luck factor.

Players bring out cards which are drafted and can be built in the game.  The start player rolls 6 different colored dice and selects cubes of that color and places them around a wind rose that rotates each turn providing those cubes for use in the game.  You can use them to build buildings or take various actions.  

This a Feld game that divides his fans, but I like it a lot.  It is a well designed game that has some very interesting mechanisms.  

I consider this an excellent and game and almost always want to play it.  It is a little hard to remember all the rules though.

Wow. The first play through of this was tough - without any idea what sort of actions the cards had it was hard to know what was a good strategy, but it was clear there was some great potential here. In the second game, everything clicked, and it became apparent that this game is fantastic. I love the dice rondel system, and it makes for some agonizing decisions. The game is not colour-blind friendly, and the theme is somewhat flimsy (there is no pretence that the action-cubes are anything but action-cubes), but this is a solid, elegant game that lives up to the Alea brand.

It is very important to play first. 
Is there randomness? yes, it is there to every player. 
Everybody gets the same dice and the same cards to choose from. 
If you play first, you choose the cards first, you get to move your ship first, and to buy a quarter first.
Then, there is a great chance you'll win the game.

There is also one more thing as much important as to play first. Making good plan when choosing the right dice, specially in the first rounds. If you manage to choose well your dice, but not playing first, you still have good chance to win, since there is a lot going on at the sea and at the city to compensate that.

RATING: 9.5
Remarkably simple once you get used to it. There are a variety of actions to take based on how many action cubes you have each round. The tricky part is managing your action cube supply because of the wind rose. Combined with die rolls for determining how many of each type of cube are available you're presented with a lot of interesting choices to make. One of Feld's better games.

Abstract resource management to play incremental effects to score points.
The core mechaninc (dice becoming action cubes on the heptagon) is nice, but the game has too much randomness (not in the dice, but rather in the cards and gold/VPs ratio) to plan anything (you rely on tactical decisions and at times play the odds). Overall its parts (quarters, ships, wall, cards, etc.) feels very disconnected, like many sub-games not blending that well together.

An excellent game that feels like Castles of Burgundy for the weight and Tzolkin for the way you have to plan ahead and delay to get resources. A very clever game that we all enjoy.

One of the better games Stefan Feld has created. Introduction of a new game mechanism, the "goods wheel", that later appeared in other games.

Thematically appealing (for a Feld!). Lots of variation because of the large amount of cards that can be used, that influence the game and your strategy,  each time you play it.

What annoys me a bit is that while playing, certainly during the first few rounds, you are driven by your board with cards. Since you need to make sure your board doesn't get full, you need to collect the resources you need to activate your cards. This is sometimes such a dominant mechanism, that you cannot really develop a strategy, and all you do is "think minimal". Many times the "think minimal" when selecting cards is very effective. 
It could be I don't play this game very well, but to me, this seems like a flaw.

Also, it is quite a solitaire game. Once someone starts using his cards, it's hard to follow what he is doing, since you cannot see what's on the small cards, and actually, you couldn't care less. So everybody is looking at his own cards. Only point of interaction is in delivering goods first and being first on the play order track. Some competition in the city area, but minimal.

Minus: 3 (solitaire, hard to follow what others are doing) - 8 (both, see above)

RATING: 8
An odd yet pleasing game. Unlike a plethora of other designers, Stefan Feld is apparently not willing to just mix up another variation of time-honored ingredients, but strives for genuinely new stuff with each new game. While this is laudable (and ensures that the new Alea games feel less like inferior versions of Alea classics than a whole lot of other new heavy Eurogames), it also makes your first play of one of his games more of a stumble than a run.

This gets better in subsequent attempts, but even then, the resource scarcity and the challenge of getting the right stuff at the right time probably ensures that the machine you build up in Macao will always be a rather clanky and cranky one. Unlike the machine of the game itself, which runs smoothly and intiutively in spite of its originality.

Initially I was excited about getting and playing this game, but no longer.  It's far too long for what it is, a little more complex than I usually like, and fiddly to the extreme.  Still and all, it's not a horrible game.

RATING: 8
One Play... Yeah, I think I like this game a lot.  I love simple rule sets.  The depth in this game comes from the planning and decision-making, NOT from remembering a thousand rules.

I won by quite a large margin, and I think it's because I really lucked out in getting the "get a commodity for one less cube" and "you can get two commodities in one turn" cards.  That was a very powerful combo.

Anyway, I really liked it.  I also love Castles of Burgundy and this has a similar feel.  Different enough to have and play both for sure, but you can tell they're from the same designer and that one influenced the other.

My relationship with Macao is a strange one.  Several years ago (TGD May 2010, The Flood), I saw it being played and concluded, after watching it for 5 minutes, that it was not my kind of game.

Discussions with others supported that conclusion, so I had avoided it for a long, long time.

Finally playing it in April 2013 this game went from a game that I probably wouldn't like to a game that I definitely do not like. 

Abstractly, my issue is that Macao is a longish game that  suggests that it has strategy but which has random elements which subvert strategic planning. At the end of the game I played, I could not look back and see any clear decision that I should have made differently that did not depend on some random outcome to make it meaningful or not.

I'd always enjoyed Feld games, and in fact had played his releases pretty much chronologically, but this one pushed him over-the-top as a must-have designer for me.
Love the use of dice  - the fore-thought needed to load up your wind rose, and then the need for a plan B when those dice didn't roll exactly the way you wanted them to.  It's a wonderfully designed game that's simple enough to explain yet challenging to play. And who really gives a damn about theme when it's all so much fun? A cube-pusher's delight!

10-29-11-Omigosh how we love this one!  It's just plain old fun, trying to figure out what cubes you're going to need, turning the windrose, picking out the cards, buying the sections of town, delivering goods on your cute little ship...and the best part is that no one can be sure who's winning until scoring is done at the end!  Very easy to learn, gameplay makes sense.

RATING: 5
Of the Feld games I've played as of my first play of Macao (Notre Dame, In the Year of the Dragon, and The Speicherstadt), this is the most opaque. It's challenging, though not overly complex, but I don't like that opacity.

In the other three, it was clear at the start of the first play what I should be doing, or at least clear enough to give me a shot at doing something productive. Macao felt like learning to juggle while taking a phone call and balancing on a rope over quicksand, and I didn't love it. I suspect I'd like it better with one less thing to manipulate, or one less layer, but I already have Feld games like that.

I'd play it again, but I can't see why I'd pull it out over any of my other Feld titles unless I had an opponent or group who was excited about it.

Likes:
- Very good for 2 players.
- Very clever cubes acquiring mechanism.
- Ideal balance between chance and long term planning. It rewards long term strategy thinking while at the same time you can't simply count everything and you must take your chances whenever they appear. That's really addicting!
- It speeds up towards the end game.
- Great risk calculation mechanisms.
- Many different paths to victory.

Dislakes:
- Components look a bit dull.
- It can get just a little bit frustrating when the dice are against you all the time (but I still win almost every time I play...).

Brilliant game. Trajan was my favorite Feld game until I played this one. The wind rose is really cool, but what makes this game is the "power moves" that come along which make every 3 or 4 turns quite intense, if not epic. Don't expect any theme, but the mechanics are top-notch. Love it!

Great 2-4 player game. Can run into some analysis paralysis as the rounds drag on and players get a relatively large number of activated cards.  With a few plays though, that hasn't seemed to be an ongoing problem.

At first I hated the windrose mechanic but it's growing on me.

RATING: 7
An interesting game that was far less tactical then I expected it to be. I tried to plan only for the near future and lost because of it.

The first couple of turns were a bit disorienting and they feel like you're struggling not to lose any points instead of gaining them. After a while I got a better grasp of the game and the cards, but you still need to read a lot of new text every turn. It does not help that some confusing terms are used. 'Activate' should have been called 'build' or 'create' because we always confused it with 'using' a card.

The game did not go over too well with some of the other players because of the above points. Still, I liked the game and its unique action point system and I definitely like to play it again to see if it gets better with more plays.

Game did not go over as well as I had hoped. Overall, it is a decent enough Euro, but there are some parts of the game I just didn't love. The cards are especially annoying. They can be costly and don't often do a whole lot. With 4 players, it seemed to drag quite a bit with a lot of downtime. However, I did like how cubes are acquired and planning how to best utilize them in later rounds. Will re-rate with 2 or 3 players. Edit: Played a 2 player game. The 1st half of the game is tedious. However, it picks up the 2nd half of the game trying to race to the ports and clear off your player mat. Just not a well balanced game and the cards can be impossible to get rid of if the luck of the dice aren't with you. My brother likes it, so I will happily play with fans of the game. It will never be my choice to pull out of the game closet though. 1/27/12 Traded to oatmeal1201 for The Princes of Florence

[i]Macao[/i] is a great game that just might be better than [i]Castles of Burgundy[/i].  Although there are many ways to score points, don't believe those who call it "VP soup".  Not all options are equally good and a bad player will get crushed in this game way worse than in CoB.

----------

After a couple more plays, I definitely think Macao is better than CoB.  Why is it rated lower, then?  I think there are two main reasons:

(1) CoB is a more streamlined game.  In Macao, there are a lot of cards that have to be read, which slows the game down if you haven't played before.  Also, the game play is somewhat fiddly.  For example, having to draw 6 cards, add up the values for the tribute offering, then remove a card (in a three-player game) is kind of funky and takes some getting used to.  Also, there is a bit more downtime when others are selecting a card to add to their tableau.

(2) Macao may overwhelm some with the number of possible choices.  There are 15 ways to choose 2 of 6 dice and within each die choice there are many considerations as to how to use cubes of that color.  Do you get your money engine going, buy a card, buy a goods tile, advance your boat and/or advance in turn order?  Do you take fewer cubes for an immediate purpose that is known or do you take a bunch of cubes for down the road perhaps not knowing what they will be used for?

----------

I now think this is Feld's masterpiece.  If this and Trajan were published in reverse order, Macao would be ranked higher.

12/20/11 Played a four-player game. 
What are these 300 cubes in six colors supposed to represent? They aren't money, or goods, or units of time, or influence, or armies, or workers, or victory points, or anything else I've ever run into in a Eurogame. So I skimmed the eight most popular reviews of the game on BGG and not a single reviewer said what they were. Nor do the rules posted to BGG. Apparently they have NO real life counterpart. As best as I can tell they're just something the designer threw in to add "complications" to the game for players to overcome.

Macao is not a terrible game if you can get past the main feature of the game, the action cubes, are never explained. I couldn't. I pretty much mentally wrote the game off five minutes into the explanation. The cubes were six flavors of pixie dust as far as I was concerned. So the whole game felt "silly" to me. The interesting way they were obtained via dice roll, how they were used, the novel rotating wind rose, and the cards that gave certain advantages were merely delicious toppings put on a pizza made of concrete; pointless. 
I also took issue with the silly abbreviations on the cards (AC, GC, PP), That's being opaque for no reason. 
Lastly, being able to receive goods on your ship after its left Macao is thematically ridiculous.

I've only played this one once, but it really didn't entertain me as much as I'd hoped.  The resource collection mechanic is really quite brilliant and is absolutely the star of this game.  The rest of it just fell flat for me.  I've never been particularly good at generating combos from a group of cards and my opponent had much more experience with this game than I did, both of which certainly hurt my overall enjoyment more so than any fault of the game itself.  It was a little too abstract, although that normally wouldn't bother me; I guess there just wasn't enough to keep me hooked.  I'd definitely play it several more times before handing out a final verdict.

I really tried to love Macao. The windrose mechanism is so clever but the game was just too dry. The cards have absolutely no flavor to distinguish one from the other (even illustrations would have helped) but they were also frustrating because there were so many of them and committing to one could mean being screwed over by lack of synergistic cards coming out later in the game. I also didn't enjoy shipping things around the board...not a fan of pick-up-and-deliver style mechanisms when they are just tacked on.

A themeless, soulless abstract of a game.  You are doing things but nothing is happening.  There is no connection between actions.  Some dice are rolled, you choose some cubes and spend them.

I enjoyed my only play of this more than expected. The mechanics of the dice are quite unlike anything I have ever seen and takes a while to wrap your head around and learn how to plan.

And I actually like how the end game changes subtly with more "1"'s being rolled.

RATING: 7
A unique dice mechanic where dice each representing different resources are rolled and then players can choose two of the resources.  If you choose a 5 than you get 5 of that resource but the trick is that you don't get them until 5 turns from when they're chosen.  Likewise a 2 will give you 2 of that resource 2 turns from now (this is kept track of on a wheel).  Players can choose the same resources as other players. 

There are also cards and a number of ways to generate VPs on the board.  Players are trying to time their resources on the wheel in order to cash in (you must spend all your resources on the turn you receive them).  

I really need to try this again.  Rating could move up or down.

Underestimated and overlooked gem of a medium-weight Euro.  Dice randomness provide euro resource cubes... can get one right, or up to six in the future... really loving that mechanic more and more.  And the gameplay is TIGHT!  Players' decisions constantly affect others' play, from card drafts to wall position to city tiles bought.  Surprisingly high affordance... a simple glance at the board will show you all the pertinent info!  Only downside is that the law/people/bldg card text can sometimes be ambiguous.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Can't tell you why, because I shouldn't, but I LOVE this game. Part of it is probably the combination of long and short term planning, and the great replayability due to the different cards coming out in each game... Oh, and then there's the 6 different color dice rolling!

As a BIG plus, this game works great with 2, 3 or 4 players. Not many multiplayer Euros work that well (or are really meant) for two players.

In conclusion: I highly recommend this game to experienced gamers... even though the theme is a complete paste-on, you're still pushing wooden cubes and it is not (in my experience) something your non-gaming friends will enjoy.

I give it a 9/10.

Always enjoy Stephen Feld.  Like his other games you have to maximize your limited choices.  Usually turns go fairly fast.  There still is luck in getting the right dice combo to get the buildings you want to build.  Wife enjoys it as these limited interaction Euro's seem to go over well with her.

Played once with four people.  Players collect cubes, which they then use to build buildings or carry out other actions.  While the cube-collection mechanism is novel and interesting.  On each turn 6 dice are rolled, one for each color of cube, and players can pick two of the dice: the number on each die represents the number of cubes a player gets of that color and how many turns in the future the player gets access to those cubes.  

Unfortunately, however, this die mechanism makes the game extremely luck heavy: players need to get the exact number of cubes needed for each building on one turn.  Thus, if a building needs 2 of one color and 1 of another, they have to rely on the dice to make that possible.  Combine this with a random selection of buildings available each turn, each of which give a variety of special powers, and you have one very complicated resource generating / building-building game.

To succeed, players needed to build buildings that had powerful actions (and could build on each other); given than getting the building requires luck (random buildings are chosen from each turn), and getting the cubes requires luck, this means that the game as a whole required a lot of luck.  

The game took more than three hours; it was not worth the time given how luck heavy it is (a player has to both get buildings that will amplify each other, then get the cubes to build those buildings, and then be able to carry out the actions that will be amplified).

Viktigt att inte satsa fel i början. Man behöver ta både ett lågt och ett högt tärningsslag varje gång så att man kommer upp i smöret efter ett tag med kubfack fulladdade sedan tidigare.

Att få ut kort är inget självändamål: bara man har tomt i slutet så. *Korten ger inga VP.* Det viktiga är att få till *samverkande* kort som alstrar kuber och pengar och VP. Köp inga kort under runda 1-3 om de inte är väldigt bra.

Man kan vinna fastän man inte satsar alls på att ligga först i rundeordningen på muren.

Om man har en bra pengamaskin bör man köpa tribut-VP nästan varje runda.

I just played this again after trading it away several months ago, and it is even worse than I remembered. The "strategy" here is completely transparent and scripted: do little bit of everything, and you will win. If other players do the same, then you might lose, but you won't be able to pin it on anything anyone did; it probably came down to whoever happened to get a sweet card draw when they were going first or cashed in on the first 3:1 VP to gold exchange rate you've ever seen.

The overflow of mechanisms in this game provide an illusion of complexity, but anyone spending more than 30 seconds on his turn is wasting time. Basically, all you do is get as many contiguous properties early in the game as you can, being sure to block others from creating such chains. Generally go for the max dice in the beginning of the game and the dice you need to activate all your cards late in the game. By default pick the cheapest cards so you can get them off your tableau fast, but do grab a couple "Game End" score cards early in the game and play to those as best you can. Cash in when the ratio is 2 VP to 1 gold or better. Then ship your ass off. That's it. Sadly, this is not "easier said than done"; it is in fact quite easy and rather boring. Really don't need to play this one again.

Second hand

Intriguing mechanic of the wind rose - getting cubes fast gives you less, taking higher numbers gives you more actions to spend later on. A typical Feld point salad, not as enticing as Castles of Burgundy but maybe we still need to grow on it when we play it more. The dice results are common for everyone.

"Macao, the mysterious harbor city on the south coast of China, is the Portuguese trading center in the far east at the end of the 17th century. The players take on the roles of the energetic adventurers who sought their fortunes in Macao. Whether as captain or governor, as craftsman or scholar, numerous exciting functions are offered the players. Who will use his various possible actions the wisest? Who will have the best plan and can acquire the most prestige by the end of the game?"

Yes, that really is the game description. Yes, the game really comes with 300 cubes. No, they don't even bother to paste a theme on the different colors, referring to them instead with such exciting names as "Blue Action Cube" or the catchier "Blue AC" for short. Yes, the entire game is pushing ACs around in order to earn more GCs [that's "Gold coins"... duh] with your B/P cards ["Building/person"... yes, the "Midwife" has the same scruffy Euro sailor icon] so you can score more PPs ["Prestige points"... victory wha?]. Yes, the game uses all of those abbreviations.

Despite all this, the game has one redeeming feature [no, it's not that it includes a regular heptagon as a game component] in the form of the action cube allocation system. Every round one die is rolled in each of the six AC colors [damn, I'm doing the abbreviation thing now... as if "action cube" wasn't abstract enough]. The number on the die indicates not only how many cubes you get in that color, but how many turns you must wait before you get them. The greedier you are, and the more actions you want to take using that color cube, the longer you will have to wait. It's kind of a reverse J. Wellington Wimpy offer: "I'll give you a cheeseburger Tuesday, unless you want grilled chicken... then you have to wait 'til Wednesday."

The game penalizes you every turn you're not able to do something, so you often have to sacrifice and satisfice. It's no use taking the promise of 6 beautiful BACs [Black Action Cubes... or was it Blue?] 6 turns from now if you don't have a single AC, much less a GC, to your name to burn this turn for PP [?]. Playing the odds and building a diverse enough economic engine so that you always have the right colors in the right quantities at the right time is a Euro-optimizer's wet dream. I mean, seriously. OMG STFU 2 BAC + 3 VAC W/ THE B/P & 6 GC 4 12 PP FTW! OMG OMG OMG! UWE! UWE! WOWWWEEEE!! [Oops, sorry... got a little carried away]. The entirety of the remainder of the game is all but worthless, however. Stefan Feld is the master of clever unremarkable games, and this is probably the cleverest and... unremarkablest? This would make a great filler; as a full game, it rings hollow.

This is a great euro game. It is strategic and tactical at the same time.  Reminds me a lot of Tzolkin in future planing but very tactical with the dice (remind me of how Bruges manage dice). Very brain burning but with such a simple ruleset. Great game!

Don't know why I like this game, but I do.  The theme is yet another historic port city / shipping / resource management game (i.e. Puerto Rico, Goa, Vasco da Gamma), which in my book is on the boring side.  However, the pasted on theme is there just to make the game more accessible / understandable.  Where this game shines (just as with the aforementioned games) is the game play mechanics and the interesting / tough decisions you need to make.

Feels like Race for the Galaxy meets Agricola, but I like this one better than both of those games. This feels like a classic Euro with how elegant and straight-forward your actions are, though it can get a little fiddly with remembering all the abilities your cards give you. Not as point salad-y as Feld's other more recent games, nor is it very similar to his older offerings. In this way, Macao feels very unique, and is probably my favorite Feld at this point in time largely because of that.

A gamer's game. What I like in particular is the rotation of ship mechanics and if you want immediate or long-term benefit by choosing which cubes you take, and setting up card combos. The small downside is it might appear fiddly because you can't exactly predict what color of cubes will come in a particular slot, new players may find it very hard to plan ahead.

Amazingly good game with many games within the game to focus on and the 120+ building people cards and 24 offices create endless ways to play...as good of replayability as I've ever seen.....I've seen people win by playing a low risk/high return of drafting the cheapest cards and I've seen someone win by high-risk/high return taking the more difficult cards and even getting punished for them and still winning...seen a building strategy and shipping strategy and city district strategy all win as well as a balanced strategy, so this trully is a multiple paths to victory game,where others make the claim but do not live up to it, like Macao......the rosewind/dice decisions really are challenging and fun trying to find the right balance between short-term and long-term returns.

In the old Portugese city of Macao, there are 12 turns. Each player first chooses a card to put on their tableau. 6 different colored dice are then rolled, and players choose two of the colored dice: the number of pips on the dice are the number of action cubes in that color the player receives, but that number of turns later, so some planning is required. Players use action cubes to activate cards, use activated cards, take territories, move on the wall (for turn order in choosing cards) or moving ships to sell goods. Some of the cards requirent different colored cubes to activate, and at the end of the game, non activated cards count against you. 

There are many things to consider, and I like the game. It might be a great game if it could be shorter. There are many possibilities of tactics that requires more play to uncover.

Ugh, I didn't like the wheel and limited resource management. I felt like the mechanic limited you and not in a very fun way.

My least favorite Stefan Feld game.  Yes, the dice mechanism is very clever, but I don't think it's clever in a way that's enjoyable.  Too much emphasis on getting your cards into play before you get penalized for holding them too long, not enough emphasis on actually USING your cards.  With consistently poor luck, it's just too difficult to make things happen in this game...until the last couple of turns, when it's probably too late to make a difference.

Rating is based on one play. I like a lot of the inter-twining mechanics, though I think the last 2 rounds almost ruin things. There's just so many things to keep track of by the last round that some folks can get overwhelmed. I didn't have a problem with it, but I can see that a lot of people will, and that will make this a very hard game to get to the table.

Great mechanisms in an overall boring game. The wheel is a very cool mechanism, but it feels very underused. Completing those absolutely random cards doesn't give you a good feeling of acomplishment, so collecting cubes in the wheel feels a bit boring in the end.

RATING: 10
It's a pretty fast one, maybe faster than CoB, which is a plus. After reading the rules, I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough action cubes to do anything, but it turns out you accumulate so many on the last turn you could sail all around the world and back. Like Trajan, you have to match up the colored cubes on the given turn in order to activate things, but there are 2 things to activate (cards and Macao city quarters) vs the 1 Trajan tile in Trajan. Much of the flavor of the game comes from the interaction of the activated card abilities, and these would seem to vary a great deal game to game, enough to make this eminently replayable. Like CoB and In the Year of the Dragon, there's the Feld variable turn order mechanic at play. Like the former (and unlike the latter), not being able to go first in this game does not necessarily mean that you lose. I like this more than Trajan because there is more randomization turn to turn with the rolls of dice. 
------
Second play with 4 took a lot longer than the first play with 3. So I may have to take back what I said about it being a fast one. But everything else is still true!
------
All of the above mostly true on a third play, although it seems that the "double price for specific ware delivery" cards have won the winner the game each time.
------
Like the best games, Macao just seems to get better with age.  Either that or it hits its sweet spot around plays 4-8!
------
After 15 plays or so, I unabashedly appreciate this game. The flavor comes from the card interplay, and there are so many different strategies to explore because of that, much more than the relatively obvious double price ware strategy. Upping from 9.

After hating Notre Dame and YotD as hatefully as I do, I wasn't expecting this game to be so... fun.  There's the same "too much to do, too few turns to do it in" and "penalty for things that are most likely inevitable" mechanics, but this time, he found a way to jam the fun into the system.

This game should have been language independent. It would be so much faster and easier just looking at the cards seeing symbols instead of text and being able to know immediately what each card does.
There is some luck in the beginning when you almost blindly select resource cubes, and whether a certain color combination of cubes that would match the cards that turn up later would be possible within a few rounds. Later on once you have the economy going it is much less of a problem and planning is easier, so the game is strategic enough. The game reminds me of through the ages (thankfully with managable playing time here, but with AP types it could get longish(3 hours)) a bit with the card picking and activation, and surely somewhat Notre Dame with the active cards providing money and VPs. Overall it seems to be a solid title with good replayability.

Another euro cube-pusher. This game's distinguishing characteristic is the dice wheel, which allows you to choose fewer cubes that you can use more quickly, or more cubes that will be available in later turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not that impressed with the game. With all of the different cards, there can be some synergy, but with the randomness of the draw, you can really get cards late game that are completely worthless. Also, the random resource generation makes future planning nearly impossible. You can try and plan after the fact, but since it's all random, you just have to be lucky to have a resource/card combo that works. Not a terrible game, but not interested in playing again.

After my second play, I don't think it's as bad as I had thought before, but it's certainly not a great game. The difficulty in planning for future rounds makes it a fairly random game. There are only a few cards that get you extra cubes, and the tiles aren't exactly an efficient way to get extra cubes. The fact that I can't clearly say how I can improve my game or what mistakes I made during play tells me that I'm not going to want to play this often, but I wouldn't refuse to play.

I really like the how elegant the rules are after you get them. The soul of the game are cards that break the rules in a way or the other but they also are the biggest downside of the game. Depending how the cards turn out the games can be very different which means sometimes a bit dull games as any building/person card can come at any time. Also there is so much of them that it's pretty hard to have a good idea what other opponent's need and any (partial) blocking of their good cards seems non-existing because of this. Still there is a lot of good stuff going on as you try to make good combos but cannot wait too long also or you'll start to get penalized when you cannot activate your cards.

The dice system is clever and I like especially the fact that everyone will have exactly the same rolls to choose from. My group(s) seem to be awfully slow at this game which isn't a good thing as I'd like to play more of it.. :-(

Maybe one day, Alea will understand that icons are clearly helping the gameplay.

The dice/action mechanism is truly brilliant. There's also some juggling with turn order, and a little bit of engine-building. The shipping and city parts create turn angst similar to worker placement games.

Moves very slowly, though. Cheap components and poor UI choices, of which replacing all the main resources (cube, coin, card, point) with acronyms is unbelievably awkward.

There is room for strategy, with lots of choices and hard decisions to make. For this reason I think that this game can be AP-prone.
The large number of different person/building cards, which only a fraction of are used in the game, assures a different game every time.
Requires a lot of table space to be played (game board + individual boards + cards + dices + wind roses + action cubes)

A pinch of risk-management, a sprinkle of economic engine, and a fair bit of card-combo thrown in. While the dice engine at the heart of the game is enchanting, I'm not 100% convinced it works quite as well as the designer intended. It can be immensely frustrating too, with everyone's game easily cursed by poor dice rolls and card draws, and made worse by the sloppy English translation.

Further Thoughts: I'm struggling to credit this as a cohesive game any more. It can be very tiresome struggling with wonton dice and watching an opponent clocking up dumb-ass-massive combos without being able to do anything about it. There is an interesting degree of balance in the game. But there's less GAME in the game than I had anticipated. Downgraded from 7 to 6.

[i]Macao[/i] needs several plays before all the options and possibilities will gel, but it repays the effort. It is not simple to teach (Stefan Feld, so no surprises there). 

Much like Feld's [i]In the Year of the Dragon[/i], [i]Macao[/i] is deep. It presents complicated long term planning decisions and relatively simple short-term choices. Initially players need to prioritise strategy over tactics: if this is managed successfully the last few turns can see rewarding card combos and big score advances.

A great game! We have only played Macao 2-player as of yet It is wonderful as a 2-player experience but I suspect with more players the dynamics of the game will really shine! The mechanics are really well integrated and the board and components are awesome! The cards...yes the cards...really make the games replay ability different every time! The options of card choices are quite varied. However there is a bit of luck in what cards you may be able to procure; similar to the settler phase in Puerto Rico (i.e. in PR you may really want that coffee plantation but if your opponent takes it...you're out of luck!) Same here! 

Of course, the Action dial is one of the most fun and challenging mechanics of the game! Rolling 6's gives you a lot of Action Cubes on the dial, but you have to wait so long to use them...intense! Finding time and AC's to allow you to move your ships is tricky also...but essential to the game! And what about that Prestige point track...push your luck...or bite the bullet and pay your hard earned Gold Coins for Prestige Points...what a game!

I really enjoyed the first play through of this.  The dice for blocks in the future is cool and interesting enough.  Despite being fun the first time, I have a feeling I will not like it much on the replay.  The strategy is basically take the most of whatever color you can get.  By the end everything will get resolved with the huge influx of cubes.  The game feels shallower than it should be for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For an alleged dice game, it surprised me with how long and thinky it is. First there's the card draft, where you're trying to obtain cards that you'll be able to both build quickly and which have an ability that complements your other cards. Building the cards however requires you getting cubes in various of the 6 colours. The dice mechanism is neat and makes life interesting. Do you take small numbers of cubes for use in the next round or 2 and get immediate use, or do you take lots of cubes for use many turns in the future and get massive benefit then. The latter seems typically better, especially as the more powerful cards requires different colours, and you need to arrange it so you receive cubes in each of those colours on the 1 turn - easy if the dice for those colours all roll the same number, but usually not so easy and you'll want to give yourself as many turns for it to happen as you can. Investing in cards that allow you to manipulate your cube selections or requirements may be useful here. Choosing the 2 colours of cubes you'll take can be a lengthy process, as you're given other options to spend those cubes and acquire victory points - buy a goods tile (get the right colour cubes in the right amount again!), move your ship to eventually deliver the goods tiles before other players, convert cubes into cash and acquire straight up VP's, adjust player order to get better card selections. Lots of things to do, lots of things to think about. It's very solitaire. I've usually got no idea what abilities the other players are using to get along. Another player might buy a goods tile I was eyeing off, or beat my ship to a harbour before I can sell towards the end of the game, or take the card I want in the draft but that's about the extent of the interaction. Almost your entire focus is worrying about getting the right cubes together at the right time to build your cards - and then spending the excess cubes on the rest. It's a game I've enjoyed for this puzzle aspect, and exploring different complementing card strategies, but it's a very quiet game, very Euro.

A slow-building open-information game with card tableau-building, a bit of pick-up-and-deliver, and some path-building, all to obtain PP. Much tactics with attempts for strategy. Some of the game is to alleviate obtaining the "-3 PP" penalties. I love the wind-rose, and the dice-shared mechanism. Boy, does my wife kick my butt at this game!

Game play basics are easy to learn and teach. It is playing that has the Learning Curve due to the "I've no idea what to do or how to strategize" factor. This Feld game is different because instead of being the typical Feldian-Point-Salad game, it is a "Here, breath through this straw for the next 80 minutes" game.

2/19/12 - Add another Euro to my list of games I enjoyed after one play. The use of die each round to draft action cubes that you place around a roundel or wind rose is brilliant. Each phase offers simplistic and easy to understand choices but the agony of what dice, cards or actions to take can be overwhelming for some.

RATING: 7.5
Cool mechanics, but frustrating (in a good way). Based on the dice, you collect cubes in order to play on future turns and use these cubes (like money) to move your ship, deliver goods, do actions and activate cards. It is tough to get what you need, so make sure to not chose too many really good cards that you will not be able to use as they are tough to activate (due to the mix of cubes needed or large cost in cubes). Well worth a try and a great addition to the Alea series. The one thing to note is that the design is not the best. The cards always refer to other cards in the game, but icons are used on the cards while words on the text, so you have to ensure you are taking the right card if you are going for a combo (but this is not a major part of the strategy).

RATING: 7
The windrose/dice mechanism in this game is a very ingenious mechanic forcing players to judge the balance in getting fewer resources now versus more later.  But, boy could this game use some better components.  The same drab artwork is on every person card as well as every buidling card.  C'mon.  Lady Violet should be sexy, not some fat guy with a beard. And the money tokens are some of the worst I have seen.  The game can be punishing, but careful planning can reduce the pain.  For me, the game was good for about 15 plays or so, but my taste for Feld's games has diminished.  Feld used to be a common name on my game shelf, but now I am down to one.  Macao is a decent game overall, it's just that my tastes have gone in a different direction.

Different, which is good. Definitely a euro game - lots to keep track of and lots of decisions. In the "short but heavier" category. 

Game starts slowly. The entire game feels like a struggle to get resources and do anything. I like the challenge, though.

I would prefer chunkier cardboard bits. They were pretty hard to punch out too. Colors are more subtle than many games but I like the look of the game overall. My wife dislikes turning the windrose and wishes it were mounted on a spinner - I don't mind it at all.

Macao is a hot little euro, in the historical shipping-goods-to-markets genre.  Its is deeper than Stefan Feld's other games (that I've played).  It has one of the nicest implementations of a rondel I've seen.  Is it thematic? Yeah right.

It does has a sweet mix of long reaching strategic decisions and tactical opportunities.  There is a lot of chance in the game, for sure, but there is also much that players can do.  Small opportunities, when taken advantage of, produce rewards.  Chance can interfere with all your plans, forcing you to improvise.  General Eisenhower was probably describing this very game when he declared [i]"Planning is essential, but plans are utterly useless"[/i].

The way the dice come out affects the character of the game: a lot of big rolls early will create a very different game than if a lot of small rolls come out early.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game feels like other Stefan Feld designs in that you end up so focused on scrambling to avoid penalties that you sometimes forget to actually try to score points.  The dice do provide some randomness, but since everyone uses the same dice (and you can use dice "selected" by other players), it doesn't end up being biased.  Overall, the game is very tense, and trying to balance short-term and long-term objectives takes center stage.

(5+ plays)

RATING: 8
I enjoy Macao, but it has some issues that I cannot understand how Stefan didn't see (outside of lack of play testing). Nice mechanism with the dice;  Neat to have to balance more, but delayed, resources with less, but immediate, resources.  Suffers a bit from down time issues as each player has to optimize a strategy on their turn.  The end game is rather flawed & borderline broken:  you can lose 3 points from a bad draw of the cards (which you can't plan for); if you have a money-engine based strategy, you can be shafted by low tribute prices at the end;  leftover money is worth nothing at the end either;  several times I have been annoyed that I planned for 'average' tribute prices & then it is randomly cheap, allowing other players to get more points that they couldn't have otherwise afforded & then my leftover cash is worthless.  The wall-based turn-order mechanism is also flawed due to the need to often sacrifice cubes on the dice-selection to get the color one needs; making some folks cube poor & other cube rich; thus the rich get richer because they can select earlier.

Macao is an ok game, but not more than that. The way that dice are used to distribute resources is innovative, but it is the main reason that the game lacks tension. Because you start with few resources, and you can choose to get few now or a lot later, you cannot do a lot the first couple of rounds. The game really starts to shine in the last 2 or 3 rounds (of the 12 total), when you have enough resources to plan. The first three quarters of the game on the other hand are boring.

***

Have not played much, but this game gets a little less interesting with every new game. Minor downgrade to 7.

***

A minor downgrade from 8 to 7.5. (Two 2-player games and one 4-player game.)

***

I like the mechanics, but the sum of the parts is perhaps not better than the parts itself. 

Need to play more.

Theme is artificial. Don't like abstracted maps. There is some detail in the presentation of the theme (the cards) but it doesn't really help.

A lot of damage controll - you mainly activate cards not to get hurt, the functions of the cards are second prio. I don't think that there can be so much real long term strategy involved. The variarity of the cards and all it's possible implications suggest otherwise, though...But many of the end-bonus-cards could be impossible to draw profit of even if you draw it early on: the other cards you need for the end-score-bonus might just not show up at all, at least not all of them that is required for your bonus - I think over 40 cards are not used in the game. And even if you are first to choose, in a game less with less than 4-players, some cards that you want to grab could be just thrown away. Anyhow, the cards you get to deal with creates variation from game to game and I think that it should be hard to rely on "pet-strategies". And that is the up-side of course...

But it is a fun game - or, it is pleasant to play.

Macao is the wind rose mechanic and that's not entirely a bad thing. It's a novel and inspired mechanic, after all. The downside for me is that the rest of the game seems to be only present to provide a reason to play around with it.

Still, the wind rose is a very clever use of dice, perhaps the best I've ever seen and even if for that reason alone Macao is a game worth playing. 

It's not Stefan Feld's best game but it's still a fun and interesting experience.

This game grows on you the more you play it, but I do wonder if it will grow old quickly. 

It's a risk management type game with interesting mechanics and decisions. Unfortunately player interaction is minimal and the game is really dry, like Hansa Teutonica dry. Good thing the game play is so intriguing.

If the game had better player interaction and if some elements were fleshed out a bit more (shipping) then this would have gotten a much better score. 

If dryness and solitary type play doesn't bother you then consider this a 9.

Solid engine-building euro, exactly the type of game I enjoy.

I've really come to appreciate both how it uses the dice and how it lets you use the engine you've built. The cards can be a little too powerful in how they randomly come up, but I think the scroll cards help alleviate that. This is a game that gets more fun the more I play.

I always have fun when I play this. Dry abstractness combined with an awkward translation mean that I don't play it as much as I might, though.

The game requires both planning and luck, and the disparate elements fit together well in play. The fact that only half the cards show up in any given game makes for considerable replay value.

Update:  I'm not sure dice and cards are a good combo in a euro.  The dice-choices mitigate the luck of dice, but the cards add such crazy curve-balls.  I'm just not sure how many more times I want the game-mechanics meatloaf.

Old:  I love this game.  There are so many possible card combinations that might give you the edge, there is endless variability.  I also enjoy the area control/resource collection aspect, and then racing to trade in goods.  The wind-rose is a head trip, and planning ahead is so difficult, but I love that too!  This is one of those kooky games that feels like they stuffed everything in there, and it still came out like a good meatloaf!

Multiple mechanics and many strategies make this game a brain-burner. The wheel mechanic means you should play 3+ moves ahead, but the multiple ways to getting points means you have to specialize in something or get penalized in other areas. The cards means there's many powers to "embelish" the game and make it replayable. It's a likeable victory point with some good parts to it.

I'm not normally a fan of Feld's designs, with their convoluted point-collecting optimization mini-games, but I rather like Macao. It has some superfluous mechanisms, but is otherwise quite tight (at least, for a Feld).

It has a very interesting mechanism for gaining cubes, and then a couple of ways to spend them for points, which are not all that interesting. The fact that you have some control, but not a whole lot, over which cubes you get which turn, makes that you can't optimize everything perfectly. A bit like Trajan, in that regard, with perhaps less tension. It sounds like a somewhat artificial limitation on player options and perfect planning, and I guess in the end that's what it is, but in practice it's quite fun. It doesn't feel frustrating when you can't get what you want, and it's exciting when everything works out.

Macao isn't a game I'd go out of my way for to play, but with its dice rolling, wind rose turning, card collecting and engine building, playing Macao is a pleasant experience.

This is a fun early Feld, where we see the inspiration for many future games. You roll dice to determine resources, you collect sets of tiles, you have the turn order stack mechanic he puts into his games, and you have an early version of his card combo mechanic you see in Bruges. It's an interesting game to play, and it's nice in how uncomplicated it seems compared to his later designs. Sometimes returning to the basics is refreshing. I didn't hold onto this as I have many of the games that overlap the mechanics, but I certainly enjoyed playing it.

One of the slightly tighter Feld games rewarding future planning. The more you can plan in the future the better. Lacks theme but has lots of replayability and card combos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It has a nice core mechanic, where the dice system creates a pool of available options - the further out the more options. The windrose is a nice way to represent those future options. The card drafting is as much about surviving as giving you an opportunity. It is still a point salad where you are collecting resource chits to score either by delivering on building a chain on the board. Converting resources to points, juggling starting order which is more important because of the limited card draft. At least there is significant competition on the central board.

While you may be able to get one strategic option going, much of it seems to be tactically driven base on the limited card draw. You spend time planning your risks, and if the dice don't come about in the right order you're hosed. 
I see a lot of what went into Trajan in this one. While I liked the concept behind the windrose and the cube allocations, I can wrap my head around the roundcala and the tile draws in Trajan better. I can see why this is popular, however, I'd prefer to play Trajan

End of the day - it just confirms my opinion that I'm not particular fond Feld's designs.

This game by Stefan Feld has many ways to earn points and the theme is thin. Writing this down is like saying that water is wet.
I like the clock cooperating with the six dice that will give you the action cubes. It demands a bit planning.
At the beginning of each turn, in player order, a card has to be chosen. And because icons were minimally used this card selecting requires a bit too much time.
And at the last couple of turns you might have so many cards that running your plans can be a bit too complex to run it smoothly.

RATING: 4
R.A says how I feel about this game exactly "I haven't felt this let down by a game in a long time. Perhaps I came into it with expectations that were too high-- my eternal fandom for 'In the Year of the Dragon' made any Stefan Feld an auto-buy for me. But, much like the tedium of the four hour bore-fest called Loyang, Macao is extraordinarily procedural.

My favorite feeling in a game is the tension from having way to much to do and not enough time to do it; I love that perfect and by-design torture of being pulled in twenty directions... wanting, no needing(!) to do it all. Right. Now.

Part of the frustration I felt with Macao is that for the first two to three rounds you do feel that gamey-goodness. Macao teases you, lulls you into thinking that you are about to play something great. But the longer the game progresses-- most oppressively in the last third of the game-- the more the choices are dictated by capricious dice rolls that collide (for better or worse) into an engine that is already too built to change.

A game like Macao offends by constraining your choices, squeezing them down narrow pathways until your work as a gamer is to simply eliminate untenable options and pick from the leftovers. While the compass-rose-dice-wheel-thing is fresh, it is also dictatorial: your choices are so narrowly determined by the fickle hand of fate that later, once you have access to the action cubes, the allocation feels limited and prescribed. 

In effect what this means is that the game comes down to drafting cards. Yes, you want to get some synergy. But the choices in each round of card drafting are also narrow. If you are pursuing a particular path because of what you have built already, the card drafting too is often obvious. This leaves the "game" in allocating dice rolls for action cubes. But here again the choices are constrained. You have to fill out all the empty spots or get dinged with negative points. And when you are free of that threat, you are left with this:
"One gray, two black are useless-- although four gray would have been great, to bad that isn't what was rolled-- I guess that leaves 4 green or 3 red... yawn."

Macao let me down not because it is a bad game, but because it gives the illusion-- but not the substance-- of a thinky, tense game. You want to build this fabulous engine and tweak the motor for maximum effect, but because the course you set for yourself often clashes with the confining and fixed possibilities of the dice, all that is left is for the monkey to pull the levers and for the engine to run itself."

Nov. 2016: From 2 to 1.

Torture.

Three word strategy: Pick big dice.

The rondel could be substituted with random cube draw.

==========================

Nov. 2011: This game rubbed me the wrong way.

It's a kitchen-sink Euro (like a lot of Euros coming out now). There's card drafting, auctioning for turn order, territory expansion, pick-up-and-deliver, and cube-pushing resource management. Not my kind of game, but so far nothing too offensive.

What really annoys me is the mechanic used to get new resource cubes. Simply put, if you want more resources of one kind, you must choose to receive them at later turn. Because resources are so scarce, the best move is usually get cubes later in the game. This by itself is fine. During the game, you draft special ability cards. You activate these cards with these resources. This itself is fine. You could draft the card first then try to get the required cubes later.

What really, really annoyed me is the luck fest involved in getting the correct cubes at the right time. I won't explain the cube/rondel mechanic here, but simply put, you do not have a free choice of which resources you want at which particular turn. The choices that you do have are determined by dice, and the options available are usually very, very restrictive. For example, during one turn, if you want red cubes, you can only get them at one particular turn sometime in the future. And if you need those cubes at a particular turn, then you are at the mercy of the dice.

To me, the game amounted to planning ahead (meaning getting lots of resource cubes that will appear later in the game) for something you can't plan for -- a special ability card with the appropriate activation cost (in cubes).

I enjoyed playing. It was like watching a good movie. All the parts worked well together and I stayed awake. I give it an 8 because of its design. As you play you admire how it all fits together. I would like to give it a higher rating, but I just can't because of the theme. At no time did I ever feel involved with trading goods or building areas of the city beyond an abstract nod to how many points I would be getting.  A favorite of mine, Roma, has the same problem regarding theme (Rome could just as well be New York) but I rate it higher because it is more interactive and shorter.

Still a fine game that my wife will play with me.

I won't lie, it was weird to play this, Notre Dame, and Rialto for the first time. After starting with games like Amerigo, Trajan, and Castles of Burgundy it was quite a departure to play much tighter designs from my favourite designer. This game in particular was quite interesting because you would like to do so much but you are so limited on what you can do and when. It is so risky to try and be ambitious and if it doesn't work it is impossible to catch up. I really like the game and am looking forward to trying to get better and more efficient.

For me, this is a perfect blend of controlled randomness, tactical play and planning. It's a rare game in the euro crowd, because it has almost tangible tension. And while we're often able to reach all our goals (activate all the cards, spend all the gold, gain control over sizeable districts), there's always that uncertainty in the back of your head: Am I able to pull it off?

Like in every good game, all your decisions matter. A game that makes you think after satisfying session: could I do it any better? In my book - a masterpiecie.

RATING: 7
Macao combines just enough luck with just enough skill to deliver an incredibly satisfying experience and intrigued me on anything else Feld has designed. Plus... it has goods delivery, which I have always been and always will be a sucker for.

Pros:
+ Amazingly calibrated balance of luck and skill.
+ Rewards forward thinking and strategic play, but also demands something of a tactical mind when executing built up turns and positioning on the wall.
+ Beautiful, simple components.
+ Goods delivery!
+ Many ways to generate victory points.
+ Cards provide a different game every time and help shape your strategy. The synergy between different cards can be incredibly satisfying.

Neutral:
[b]o[/b] Not newbie friendly. While the game has luck a skilled player will nearly always TROUNCE a new player and it takes a couple games to get the hang of things.

Cons:
- Pretty fiddly and you'd probably better either bag each type of cube separate or do what I did and buy some Plano boxes.

I can certainly see how some people would really like it. It's fun. It's kind of crazy and although it uses dice, there is not really that much luck. Macao has twelve turns and during turn six, I was thinking that I'd rate Macao a nine. It was fun to pick the dice to get the action cubes and to plan out what kind of actions I'd need for future turns. But about turn nine, I realized that Macao doesn't build the way I'd like a game to build. Usually, games start out slow and as the game goes on, players have more resources and can do more cool things. Because at the end of the game all of the dice are essentially ones, you only get one action cube to place. Earlier in the game, when you can collect large numbers of cubes, you can't possible know what cards you will have access to at the end or what cubes you will need to plan for these final turns. You do get to collect a pool of the action cubes ahead of time but without knowing which cards will appear at the end of the game. 

Additionally, as the actions you can take decreases, you've got a ton of cards to activate, so each player's turn takes a long time while they aren't really deciding anything they didn't already decide to do six turns ago. The end game is time consuming, boring and it squashed any excitement that I had at mid game.

Another clever use of dice game by Stefan Feld. The wind-rose mechanic makes for some agonising decisions; choose big on resources that you won't be able to use for a few rounds or choose less to use sooner!
The game plays over a set number of rounds & you really need to keep on top of things as the end comes much too quickly when there's so much you still want to do!

With so much to do each turn and several ways to gain VPs (delivery of goods, expanding quarters in the city, buildings) as well as a fair bit of randomness (dice and cards) this can feel like a tactical game of short term opportunism and optimization vs. one rewarding long term strategizing. The rondel + dice mechanic is unique and brilliant, as is the tradeoff between volume of goods and how soon you will gain those goods. To be played strategically, this is a long game (and prone to AP).

RATING: 1
A journey between boredom and tedium, with the most exciting thing to happing in a turn is moving along a wall.

The turns are too long and the game pace too short. Hard to formulate a strategy. Hardly a trading game as you would think it would be given a name like Macao. Boats take forever to move, generating resources is too limited.

Simply dreadful, I will not get those 2 hours back, which is a shame since there are so many better games to play.

Interesting strategy game that has some tactical decisions with the dice rolls.  Definitely a game that multiple plays makes you play better.  Knowing the cards is helpful. Very intriguing game that has multiple strategies  to victory.   The most interesting thing is the dice roundel which forces you to continue to decide whether to play more now or play for the future but also not take a penalty for not having any resources on a turn.  This is a thinkers game that is a fun euro and actually maintains a feel of building something as you go along.   One down thing is AP can happen toward the last few rounds as there are lots of options that you have created through your tableau of cards.  However, the first few rounds sometimes feel like they play themselves as there aren't many options.

RATING: 6.9
A simple points scoring game. You have various methods of scoring points using resource cubes. The resources are a selection from a random set and arrive after you have chosen then, the more you choose the longer the delay. You can use them to purchase victory points in various ways. The most immediate is taking over districts in a city to form an enclave, the least immediate is selling the goods from that to far off places. In between is converting your cubes to gold and buying victory points on a fluctuating basis, or purchasing development cards (worth effectively 3 each but they give bonuses to other things). 
The mechanisms are easy to pick up but the strategy is more difficult, you can focus on one aspect or find synergies between different parts.

This used to be one of my favorite Felds - and I still think it's a good game, but it's definitely gone down a bit in my estimation recently, which was confirmed by a recent play. (I rated this 8 for a long time.) The mechanics, while relatively simple, are as always with Feld, completely original and lead to tough decisions. But Macao is a little fiddly what with all the cards, not to mention he cubes which you have to keep in 7 clear different sections as you rotate that wheel in the middle of them (if only this game were to get a deluxe edition with fixed sections for the cubes and a pointer you could rotate!). And ultimately I find it less enthralling than many other Feld games (chiefly Trajan, Luna, Aquasphere, Amerigo and Bora Bora). It's a good game, but I do think it lacks a certain something.

Lots to think about and manage in this game, which I enjoy. I particularly like finding the balance of selecting dice that will allow you to do something small now versus waiting several turns to do something larger.

Multiple plays are needed to become familiar enough with the cards to discover synergies but it is well worth playing. The steps to complete a turn are also very simple so this game is surprisingly simple to teach for how much is actually going on.

(+) Original gaming mechanism, feels different
(+) Accessible to beginners, yet strategically challenging enough for more experienced players
(+) Rather much depth for a rather short game

(-) A little too luck-dependant for my taste. The dice offer an original gaming mechanism, but this is the most luck-driven Feld-game I have played so far (which includes "In the year of the dragon", "Notre Dame", "Luna", "Trajan" and "Castles of Burgundy".
(-) Artwork looks ok, but is very unfunctional: too many text cards granting players special abilities quickly become confusing, certainly to get a good overview of what your opponents are capable of
(-) Boring theme

This is a Feld I would rather not have played - as always some innovative mechanics but the execution is less than stellar this time... unlike most of his games there is very little one can do to mitigate luck here, and the game is all the worst for it. The card combo and mostly tactical nature of the game make the game unbearable with more than 2, especially when AP prone players are taking part - so an occassional 2p only in my books.

Quick playing (4 new players finished in under 2 hours) engine development game.  Has definite phases - the slow initial phase where you think nothing will get done, the middle accelerating phase as things start to come together, the final rush to finish and maximize points.  Lots of cards with variable powers are the key to the various paths one might exploit to victory.  But with so many options, one does need to stay focused on a few paths for maximal benefit.  First playings likely to seem more random due to all the new cards, dice, etc in the game.  But with familiarity, will settle into a more structured game with choices.

Some cool ideas here, but I wish there was a way to mitigate bad luck.  I couldn't seem to get cubes to stack on spaces and wasn't sure how to advance my position.  Maybe a way to trade 4-1 for a specific cube, or tone down the punishment markers to 1-2-3-4-etc. points as you get more.  I dunno...the cards initially felt like you should target them in synergistic ways...by the end they felt like pain to be avoided.  Would try again.

I like the dice mechanic in this game. It's a really neat idea and it adds a lot to the game. But it's too competitive for me. All your plans can be ruined by the decisions of another player.

Also, it's a difficult game to do what you want because of the randomness of the die rolls. You may never get to play a card because of how the dice end up rolling.

The first Stefan Feld game I really liked.  The action wheel/allocation of action cubes is a really nice mechanic.  Once you know what you're doing, the turns fly by quickly, so it feels a lot shorter than it is.  My main gripe is just that there really is no theme at all - just different ways to get points, but it doesn't bother me as much as Trajan did.

There is enough going on in this game that a player could pick a different strategy nearly every time they play it, which means a) I can always think of something I should have done differently, and b) I always want to play it again.

I really like the windrose mechanic here.. It's very clever and original. The way the dice work is also very cool. Just played it again today after 6 months without playing, so I need more sessions to appreciate the layers. First couple of rounds do feel quite small as you're just grabbing the first cards. So it's not easy to activate the good ones because you won't have the required cubes more than likely. So I found myself claiming a lot of areas in the city for resources early on. I also like the little stock market where you can buy vp's for coin, based on the cards that show up for the round. I feel like this game and Luna are the most unorthodox games Feld has made, they're very different from all of his other designs. The rulebook is very well written, but the components are shite. Am thinking of ordering some meeples to replace the 48 ownership markers.

Sold. This game is just too dry for me, taste has shifted and I must be in accordance with the changing weathers. Had my time with it, just moving on.

This game was not on my radar at all and I was blown away by how good it is.  The decisions are very rich and the game play gives lots of ways to advance.  The resource planning is the best part of the game.  The goods delivery was the weakest I thought, a little too open compared to the difficult planning in the rest of the game but still solid.

Macao gets a bit fiddly in the final couple of turns - especially if you've stored a lot of cubes and have a lot of plans. I think I like the game quite a bit. More than Notre Dame with its multiple methods of collecting points and resource generation through cards.

Interaction is fairly gentle. There's the positioning on the wall building to allow you to grab better cards, build city spaces before others and get your deliveries in before your opponents. Other than that there's bugger all interaction, but a lot of waiting around for other players to run through their actions. If players plan while others do then you can keep the pace up, but the game does drag in places and it suffers as a result.

I like the resource wheel idea in Macao. I like that all players select from the same roll. I like the planning ahead with limited information of which cards are coming up. I like the different strategies you can plan ahead for. Sure I feel like an accountant doing it, but for a fairly dry game it gets my juices flowing. It's a bit of a puzzle.

The wife doesn't like this game. Too fiddly and hard to keep track of everything she's entitled to on her cards and what others are entitled to on theirs. She had some interesting ideas about improving the design of the game to better keep track of the bits and actions. I think with a bit of self organisation you can separate your every turn and building entitlements with your end of turn and specific cube entitlements. When you get a system you can manage it fairly easily. You have to keep an eye on what your opponents are picking up too, but only if you want to do well.

Can't work out whether this game is a 7 or an 8 for me. Afterwards it feels like a 7 - the next morning it feels like an 8.

Fiddly as it might seem at first sight, this is a very solid game packed with awesome (and original!) ideas. I love the action wheel! And I always like when there are a lot of possible combos with the cards.

At first I was afraid that what looked like replayability might actually be randomness... but after repeated plays, I must say I like how there can be no winning strategy, as one never knows which cards will (and won't!) come out.

Gain prestige through tributes, shipping goods, utilizing people, constructing buildings and offices, and controlling adjacent districts in Macao. What's not to like?

UPDATE Oct-25: Bringing it up a half point. I like how the game gradually leads you from feeling weak to powerful, and at that exact moment it's over. :P

UPDATE Dec-3-2010: I suspect this is a solid 8.5. I am always happy to see this come to the table. By definition, that makes it a 9, but with only 7 plays I suspect half a point is just from the novelty of it, which may wash out after another 7 plays.

Edit 11/10: I REALLY don't enjoy playing this game. I managed a win by like 38vp last night, but that didn't make me feel any better about the annoyingness of the game during play.

I continue to think the following is true:

I think I would like Macao better with the following house rules:

1. Roll dice BEFORE drafting cards each round
2. Each player has a built-in Warehouse which can hold 1 cube over from round to round.
3. Office cards (the ones that allow you to trade a cube in for a gold coin) may instead hold a cube of that color over for the next round (so either trade a cube for a coin or store a cube)

RATING: 5
I can see why people like Feld games, but after this experience, and Trajan, I'll be wary about playing any other of his designs. The mechanic in Macao is interesting - like the Mancala in Trajan, but what is the point of it? It bears zero relation to the trading theme, and this is what bugs me. The player is trying to solve a puzzle which bears no relationship at all to the theme. What do these "Action Cubes" represent? The luck element is high, some cards are very strong, especially if they appear early, and turn order can be critical. Everything appears to be too random. Component wise, the still available city quarters were hard to detect from the ones already taken, adding to the frustration of the other factors in the game. As it happens I won the only game I've played of this but didn't enjoy the experience at all.

RATING: 10
My absolute favorite crisis management game.  It has many different avenues to collect points with lots of tough, important choices.  Do you use your cubes to move you ship closer to a port to deliver your goods, or do you use them to get further along the turn order wall or do you use them to take over a city quarter?  Amidst all of these decisions, you have to choose whether you want less cubes now or more cubes later and have to keep your tableau moving as every card you acquire above 5 is -3 points.  This may go up to a 10 with additional plays.  Excellent depth, controlled chaos, and oodles of fun!

Update following my first 4p game.  Wow, I didn't think it could get better, but it did.  It is incredible.  Macao is just one of those games that I can't get enough of.

Macao --

Played once; three-player.

I love the choice the wind-rose forces:  a few resources soon, or many later.  A nice mix of strategy and tactics, with the luck of the dice preventing strategy from playing too strong a role.  Conversely, the luck can be a problem if you don't acquire at least one of the cards which helps mitigate luck.  Turn order can be quite important in acquiring key cards, but once you've established a card engine (activated cards whose powers  interact reliably), then turn order becomes merely a matter of convenience.

I like Macao a lot.  If we had unlimited space, I wouldn't hesitate to add this to our collection.  As our crowded shelves currently stand, I find it difficult to devote space to a rather slow-playing game we would likely play only infrequently.

[i]Update 07 Nov 2010:[/i]  After deciding we didn't need to add the game to our collection, Rich and I found ourselves talking about the various mechanics with such admiration that we realized it does indeed belong on our shelves after all.  The dice selection / wind rose mechanic is the most novel feature (with some similarity to Yspahan, I admit), but the other features (like the changing value of turn order, and the collection of tokens in the city quarters, and delivery to matching ports) are notably well-balanced.  The card powers can be unfair, but they bring such interesting interactions.  After our first game, Eric showed us some cards which had not happened to come up, and we found ourselves looking forward to seeing how they would affect play.  So long as we commit to playing our turns quickly, this game may hit the table more often than we originally anticipated.

Three games. The right building combinations go a long way to success. But just as important is getting the dice to roll the right numbers/colors for the buildings that you need to activate. They dice may be working perfectly for someone else and not for you, or vice versa. I don’t want to plan dozens of cubes each round for future rounds, but I mostly don’t want my results to be entirely determined by getting lucky based on the buildings I happen to have acquired. Still, you can do better when you pick a plan and follow through with it from the beginning of the game.

I have already made a fix that goes a long way to helping: you can pay 1 GC to make a die +/- 1 (this affects only you). This helps A LOT, but it's still not quite enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Macao's wind rose mechanism is a flash of minor brilliance. You ideally want as many action cubes as possible from the dice you pick, but getting more cubes also means that you'll be waiting longer to access them. Equally important is the combination of cubes you get, because a good part of the game rests on activating cards to be used in a rudimentary engine. 

Despite the game being largely dependent on dice rolls, there are ways to manage luck. You have to compete for turn order to avoid getting stuck with dross from the draft, powerful cards are balanced out by complex activation costs, and so on. Of course, you will occasionally struggle with even simple activation costs, and this brand of randomness won't sit well with many. However, the luck still falls within acceptable limits for me, and I like the feeling of building up for big turns where I'm able to fire off several cards at once.

Of course, Macao still has a few real shortcomings. On the surface level, the pointless abbreviations (GC, AC, BP) are a minor annoyance. Digging deeper, this game can yield to some nasty AP when observing your opponents' potential moves, especially in claiming city quarters. And even if you aren't AP-prone, a few rounds can really grind by as you manage a bunch of accumulated cubes while your opponents simply watch on. The game also scales differently as competition for shipping and claiming city quarters tightens up considerably with more players, so pick your poison.

All things considered, Macao is a great medium-weight game of luck management with a sleek ruleset. Achieving a good spread of action cubes provides most of the game's tension. The VP paths here are remarkably constrained, so I consider this the most accessible of Feld's big box efforts. Having long given up on Feld's attempts to adhere to theme, I can even overlook the fact that goods are able to teleport onto ships in the middle of the ocean.

RATING: 8
The 'wheel' mechanic turns this fairly generic-themed euro into something outstanding.  The mixture of planning, compromise, and reaction that must be balanced in pursuit of VPs throws tons of good choices at you, while the lack of foresight into the rolls of the dice keeps human calculators from mathing out and dragging the game into AP land

#67 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Macao is classic Feld in that there are a lot of things going on. What I like most about this game is the way you collect cubes by selecting dice and placing the cubes at certain points of your wheel, which advances each round. You have to do a lot of planning ahead to be competitive in this game, so if that isn't your thing, this isn't for you.

Most pasted on theme ever! This could have just as easily been a space game or an old west game. The components are thin cardboard chits with small cheap cubes. The cards and board are too small. The colors can be hard to tell apart in certain lighting... especially the purple and red. Who chose the colors for this? Bleeeccchhh! Some of the translation is terrible and a handful of the cards are ambiguous without any card sheet for reference in the rule book. Is there an FAQ anywhere?
With all that said, I LOVE THIS GAME! It definitely gets better the more you play it is always a challenge. I think this is a game I will keep coming back to over and over (8 plays so far).

Terménybegyűjtős, foglalós, kereskedős játék a Macao, amely fő ereje a hatszögletű keréken alapú mechanizmusban van. Igaz, hogy a játékban akár nagynak is mondható a szerencse szerepe a kockadobások miatt, de mivel mindenki ugyanolyan feltételekkel választhat a kockák értéke szerint nyersanyagot így mégsem olyan vészes a dolog. Izgalmas, fix fordulós a játék. Többféle stratégia is győzelemhez vezethet. Egyedüli negatívuma a játéknak a minden körben szerezhető lapok száma miatt a játék végén nagyon komolyan kell figyelni, hogy átlássa a játékos nemcsak a saját, de ellenfelei lehetőségeit. Ettől függetlenül több játék után már bizonyosan jól átlátható a játék, ami a nagyon sokféle akciólap miatt nagy újrajátszhatóságot biztosít.

Igazán megoldhatták volna képekkel is a kártyákat a szövegek helyett.

[2012-07-21]
Második játékra közel 2 év után került sor. A magyarított lapok könnyebben átláthatók voltak, de még így is nehéz 12 lapot jól menedzselni, a többiekére is figyelni pedig szinte lehetetlen. 12 kör sok. A játék most is nagyon sokáig tartott és néha nagy a holtidő 4 játékosnál. Most kevésbé tetszett, mint elsőre, de a ponton nem változtatok még.

[2017-07-16]
5 év után újra. Ugyanazt tudom írni, mint 5 éve. Az utolsó két kör nagyon hosszúra nyúlhat 3 játékos esetén is. A játék végén megmaradt pénz és terménylapkák adhatnának még pontot valamilyen formában. A játék továbbra is tetszik, de 1 pont mostmár lejön.

The 5th Feld game I've played, and I was mind-blown by this one. My best Feld so far; just edges out [thing=31594]In the Year of the Dragon[/thing]. Relentless pressure to think, think, think.

This game needs to be approached with a long term strategy... otherwise you'll be constantly engaged in firefighting and not score very high.

RATING: 5.5
Fans of drafting cards with a bunch of different ways to convert cubes will love this game.  Six cube currencies combine in different ways to buy stuff.  You can't save them from turn to turn so you never know if you will be able to match currencies together so you play the odds.  At that point the game is yours to lose rather than to win.  If the odds don't line up (either from random card flips of what you can buy, or by getting the cubes you need from the dice) your screwed sucka!  I don't mind random screwage in eurogames like Peloponnes because the game is only 1/2 an hour long here if you get screwed you have to sit out the rest of the game.

The end game is really dull, too.  Many of these engine building euros suffer from each player's ability to do too much and the turns drag, but here it is the opposite, as you reach closer to the end of the game there are fewer options for you (the cubes start drying up).  

The real madness is the VP cash-in, who knows if what you are buying into is worth it.  If you are unable to generate the money when the market is right you are screwed.  When three gold will get you 10vps that is the equivalent of delivering all the goods to one region.  How can you feel good about continuing to play the game when you miss that?

The theme not only is nonexistent, but is aberrant from any reality.  Macau has such a cool geographical lay out, yet they ignored it to the point where they put the ocean to the west of the city.  WTF!

The dice wheel is cute though, it might be nice to see this in a war game for unit resupply.

So, this would likely be a 10 for me if it didn't have a harsh "punishment mechanic". It is really an amazing, fun, involving, deep game - right up my alley - Love the Feld. It has a really cool dice mechanic that you've never seen before, nail biting decisions, a really fun tableau system, cool cardplay, etc etc - just fantastic. 

So, the punishment comes at the end, if you didn't manage your tableau correctly. Don't get me wrong - it doesn't make me dislike the game - but from a design standpoint I've come to realize that there is really no need for stuff like that. I feel that mechanic adds more stress than interesting, deep play, and there are so many amazing euros without that element, that it seems a tad "old" to me. Take a look at Castles of Burgundy: (from Feld as well)a "10" on my list - and no punishment mechanic at all.

Interesting mechanics, in how the rolls that you get help you plan for the future.  I played with incorrect rules the first time that I played, so there were way too many cubes and the interesting challenge was gone, plus it dragged the game out a bit longer.  I'd like to play it with the correct rules sometime, although I'm concerned that the luck element is a bit too overbearing for this one to be elevated to elite status.

UPDATE: Played it with right rules and it just seems that you don't have nearly enough control, and are constantly assaulted by having to fulfill yet another person/office. I think that if you could choose three dice per round, it would be a much better game. I'd like to try it one more time before finalizing the rating, but I'm not that crazy about this one.

Wow, this [b]is[/b] a great use of dice! There is randomness in the initial turn order, but the rest of the randomness/luck in the game is shared equally amongst players since everyone uses the same dice roll from which to choose 2 specific dice (and all have access to the same cards, based on turn order). You have to try to plan up to 6 turns in advance, arranging to get the cubes you want (hoping, of course, that the right dice rolls come up). Cubes (6 colors) are used to activate cards (which generally give you a bonus each turn), collect goods from the city, move your ship between various ports demanding those goods, advance on the turn order track, etc. But because you cannot count on a specific die color rolling a specific number (even after 6 tries), you have to maintain flexibility and find other back-up ways of using any cubes you have been collecting ... so choose the right cards and collect the right goods tokens!

As someone commented, this is like Yspahan crossed with Duck Dealer: great use of dice, with accumulation of action cubes used to do stuff. Unlike Duck Dealer, though, there is a reasonable limit on how many cubes you can collect and the actions are much simpler -- meaning that there will be no 30-minute turns!

The main innovation here is the dice-rolling and cube-distribution-rondel-thingie. The gold-for-points mechanism is also interesting. Cards-that-do-things is an oldie but a goodie. All in all, this is a terrific cube-pushing resource-managing theme-deficient (although I never missed it -- the underlying mechanisms are really quite interesting and fun) Euro I am looking forward to playing more!

But I'm not sure why they couldn't say "gold" instead of "GC", and "cube" instead of "AC", or just use icons!!

This is amazingly popular at the Tennessee Games Day.  [I mean relative to other recent Euros.]  I have ended up in a game of it the last 2 years.  I enjoy the city connection and goods delivery.  The cube collection method is kind of meh.  The money subsytem seems totally grafted on, and the cards don't add all that much relative to the effort involved.  Overall it's not bad but I think I've had enough.

This is the second of Stefan Feld's games I've played after In the Year of the Dragon.  ItYotD is the better game in my opinion but I still quite liked Macao, there's an awful lot more depth to mine out of it.  It is one of the heavier resource-allocation Euros I've played and games like this typically put me off before I even give them a chance, they always just seem so dry and stuffy.

I was interested in this one though because of, and one of the things I still loved after playing it, the wind rose component.  The wind rose is a wheel that you turn one tick every round and the pile of resources it points to after turning is your supply for that round, those piles are accumulated by rolling different colored dice each round and getting the number of cubes of that color in that many rounds for use.  This is a really unique and interesting twist on typical resource management.  You have to plan in the short as well as long term to collect all the different colored cubes necessary for what you want to do because that supply is only available for that round.  You also take a point penalty if ever you don't have cubes available for a round.  This game forces you to think on a rolling 6-round time table.

There is also a good variety of things to do with those resources every turn.  There are buildings/people/offices to activate then use once activated, gold to acquire and then use to purchase victory points (or use certain activated cards), city quarters to buy, a boat to navigate, goods to sell at port, and a turn order marker to move.  The amount of depth and strategy necessary to find the most profitable combination of these actions and plan for them on such a long time table provides a very attractive amount of depth and variability for me and the random factor of the dice makes it not feel as mechanic as other resource management games.

This also makes it so, like ItYotD, there are many paths to victory which also gives this game a lot of replay value since you can try many different strategies and they could all be viable.  My first game was with 3 players and each player played a little differently and our final point totals were very close.  2 players vied for first position on the wall to ensure they got their first choice of building but one focused on card combos that allowed him to collect and sell goods at port while the other focused on collecting large amounts of money to buy the point tribute every turn and cards that would give him an every turn point bonus.  Meanwhile I neglected my position in the turn order and focused instead not on card combos but simply buying a large connected city string and selling as many of those goods as I could at port.  And my opponents attacked an opportunity in the final round by buying up the two cards I could have played with my last turn resources so I took an end-of-game point loss for not completing my entire tableau so there is opportunity to interact though that is one of the shallower areas of the game (player interaction).

100801: Macao plays 2, rating 7
I liked Macao better than Notre Dame, a game that gave my a similar gaming experience when I first played it. The luck factor makes it easier to play with non-gamers. My first, and hereto only plays, where with a gamer and a non-gamer, and it went really well. The three steps you do every turn is easy to remember - card, dice, actions - and even if the first play was not even in any regard, so wanted my non-gamer friend instantly play another game of Macao. She liked it, I, thought it was OK. I bought this game thou it was cheap and it will get some more plays.

RATING: 6.5
This theme is super pasted on and bland even for a euro game. I liked aspects of the game, but I didn't feel like the mechanics meshed well together. Sometimes in was impossible to get two colors in the same section of the Wind Rose. Maybe if there was a mechanism that helped to mitigate some of this randomness, I would have enjoyed it more. I did enjoy the engine building though that was also sometimes frustrating as the cards available each round were very random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Too many cards in the game turning it a huge turn consuming with lots of repetition. Also the random dice throwing could actually be more interesting if the rondel physically worked out but it doesn't. When playing I'm always arranging cubes around the rondel which is annoying.

The rest of the game is just a few well know mechanics in a themeless game about Macao or Jamaica or South Africa.

Best Feld game. Suspect better with 4 than 2! 2 player still a bit solitaire.

After 4 game think it is very interactive 1) Competition for city quarters, turn order (choice of building is vital) and the race to ship.

Variety in cards means no 2 games have felt similar and there are a lot of paths to victory.

The theme is a total paste on and, like Hansa Tuetonica, it feels rather abstract.

Card rules poorly worded (translated) and rule book needs a section on meaning. Components not great and graphic design could have been better

Having said it's a great game, too much to do not enough time and a delicious tension between the need to get things done quickly and stock up cubes for the end game

Typical Feld game who has admittedly makes a game based on a cool mechanic and then builds a game around that.  In this case the mechanic is the dice being rolled to produce cubes of different colours, but then the higher the number, the more dice you get, but the longer you have to wait to cash them in.   Interesting mechanic, with a typical Feld "point salad" thrown in there too, this game doesn't make it to the table often, but I enjoy it enough when it does.

The usual Feld game : all mechanics and no theme.  Also, like most Feld game, it's very punishing and limiting.

Another comment compared the game to riding a bucking bronco, which I think captures the feeling pretty well. In the first few turns you're forced to take cards you can't afford, then have to try and work them into a plan for the (uncertain) future.

There's an annoying luck-factor, though it can be mitigated and I don't think a player with a balanced strategy should suffer too many negative effects from it. But lucky rolls or lucky draws [i]can[/i] have a huge positive effect.

What I most like is the forced forward-planning. You can make a reasonable showing in Puerto Rico playing purely tactically, but Macao literally [i]cannot[/i] be played without planning several turns in advance. It's an interesting experience.

--

I have to lower the rating to reflect my general distaste for, in particular, keeping track of upcoming characters. In practice, though, this game was just fired by Trajan and Tzolk'in. Everything I liked about Macao, they do better. Traded for Imperial.

After three plays, this game is an interesting mix for me.  I don't like that turn order is EXTREMELY important, and I hate the terminology and wording on the cards.  On the other hand, the core gameplay is outstanding, with a great mix of long-term planning vs short term tactical decisions.  I guess that means it's about an 8.  It's a game I'd like to own, probably, but I wouldn't be willing to pay the exorbitant OOP prices for it.

Rulebook is in color with many examples, and for the most part well written.  Game time is about 2 hours which seems to go quick.

This can be a very frustrating game and one I like to play only when I have all of my mental faculties up at 100 percent.

This is probably more of a personal problem than anything.  Its a great game with enough depth to make me want to revisit it again & again!

RATING: 7
A single play so far, but I would like to play it again, mostly to correct what was my biggest mistake -- not being first enough times on the wall so that I could choose the best card. With suboptimal card choices, you end up just staving off the -3 points and not building the efficient engine you need. The first time I play games like this or Le Havre, I never fully realize the importance of having cards that give you dividends each turn and not just grabbing gold.
I really like the innovative use of dice such as in Yspahan because I don't like dice games usually. Also good is cubes as action points and the turning wheel.     
However, a couple of things seem off. First, the idea that the goods you buy should be next to each other to create an area makes no sense. Also, the map makes it look as if European cities are in the middle of the ocean. Lastly, there is one card that is way too powerful -- the one that doubles the points you get for delivering goods.

Typical alea. Thoughful, resource-juggling, largely solitaire. A Delight.

Acquiring the right cards (which to some extent depends on your turn-order position) plus choosing cubes to activate the cards and then exploit the card powers seems key - the equivalent of the game’s economic engine. Maximising the number of times you can use the prestige bar to buy VP is important (and choosing the right turns to forgo the purchase). Buying town tiles and delivering them has always seemed a weaker strategy in our games, but maybe we just haven't seen anyone really go for it in this way yet.

Uprated to 9 after 8 plays (of the German edition). After 9 plays of the German edition I now have an English copy. Uprated to 10 after 24 plays.

I truly hate this game.  It's frustrating beyond all belief.  I'll never play it again and actively hate it.

Macao was my favorite play at GenCon 2010. CAUTION: Don't expect to win the first time you play. It takes a whole game just to figure out your strategy options for next time. The die roll mechanic was fresh and unique. It's a meaty sucker--the stuff I thrive on!  The rule book was a hard read though.

A lot going on and a ton of cards to get to know.  Has a few solid ways to score and a lot of little nickel and dime ways as well. Certain cards will give you good end game scoring if you can get them out. I want to play more and explore it.  So far getting my butt kicked by pick up and deliver heavy wife.  Meanwhile I'm trying to get an engine going that only comes to fruition 3/4 through the game.  Finding the balance of when to take loads of cubes versus short term is key.

Update : I recognize this is a good game.  I do.  I have been able to get a good feel of cube acquisition and card use.  I was happy with my plans.  I am just done with the pain factor.  I just don't like the disconnect between the card use and the pick up and deliver in some games.  I think the part of the game of goods delivery and city area control is just superfluous and boring.  It has multiple paths to victory but sometimes it just doesn't feel like I am doing anything even when I am doing well.  This ship has sailed.

The game has many interesting ideas, but all tied together by a random background which peaks with the cards. I like the idea of the activation cost of the card based over quantity and quality of cubes and the wheel of dices, but in overall I suffer too much the randomness.

Very interesting game.  It seems like the first part of the game is trying to spread our your resources to be as potentially flexible as possible to avoid getting punished.  There is a lot to take in at first with 24 cards on display to start and at least 4 new ones every turn.  Couple that with the play on the board, the area control of the market and the weirdo resource rosette and it gets a bit complicated.  Overall, I'm intrigued and am looking forward to giving it another go sometime soon.

I love Stefan Feld and we own quite a few of his games. This was yet another winner. Tossed the insert to use a large weekly pill container to hold the wooden cubes (and there are plenty of them...). Downside: I could see this game getting fidgety with more than 2 players very quickly and needs quite a bit more space than the board itself would suggest.

This is by far the best Euro to be released in quite a while.  This one rapidly shot up my game list and now sits near the very top of my games of all time.  There are multiple paths to victory often driven by a deck of cards that you will only make it halfway through - thus allowing for EVERY game to play differently.

Interesting dice mechanism (something like in Roma). Random, too random? I don`t know. Taking the wares is too much eurogaming (you don`t take only the ware, that you wan`t, you wan`t to have many markers in adjecent regions). Interesting that you become a card in every round and you must buy them later. Wan`t to play more

You don`t only become a card for a combo, you try to become a card that you can activate, because when you don`t activate cards you become minus points.

On the wheel you can take many cubes in future rounds or less in present round. When you don`t have cubes in present round you cecome minus points. You can risk.

17-Mar-10: Played Macao last week. Innovative cube-collection mechanic. But too much luck in cards available per round. Still, the card powers are nice. 

It's interesting with how you collect cubes. There's 6 different types of cubes in 6 different colours, right? Each round, someone rolls 6 dice. Each dice corresponds to the colour of a type of cube, so a red dice gives red cubes. Then everyone decides which 2 dice to choose; they are allowed to pick the same dice as another person so player A and player B can both choose red and blue dice. Depending on the number on the dice, you get cubes. So a 5 on red dice produces 5 cubes. But now the catch - you've got a little wheel in front of you which depicts 7 segments:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/668203/macao

When you pick a 5 red die and get 5 cubes, these cubes go next to the Segment number 5. After everyone gets their cubes, everyone turns their wheel clockwise 1 segment. Notice the segment with the arrow? That segment now points to the cubes that you get to use this round. So those 5 red cubes you just collected? You'll only get to use them 5 rounds from now. 

So you need to forward plan a bit. This, I like.

You also must try to spend all your cubes because unspent cubes this round are wasted. This, I don't mind.

What I don't like is that you don't know what cards are going to turn up 5 rounds from now. To me, it seems to be counter-intuitive to the whole "forward planning" thing. 

A big part of the game is setting yourself up in a future Killer Round with heaps and heaps of cubes to spend. The cards break the rules; card powers are like "Get an extra red cube when you collect red cubes", or "Game End: Get 7 VPs", or "Everytime you pay Gold to get VPs, get an extra 2 VPs". There's quite a bit going on with the ships on the board, and the markers in the city, but that is fairly straight forward.

07-Apr-10: First choice is key in Macao IMHO

02-Nov-10: There's no such thing as a "quick game of Macao" :-p

Wow!  Excellent game for gamers.  It's a bit heavy for anybody but people who know euro-style games.  It's a bit pusher game.  But the glee in building up that stack of cubes can't be beat.  Sometimes turns can take extra long.  The end-game is a bit of a let down.

I really enjoy all of the cube pushing that occurs in this game.  The dice are used in a fun and unique way, such that the players must weigh the pros and cons of few goods now against more goods later.  That, and trying to get certain colors of goods together on the same turn make for an engaging game.

There's quite a lot going on in Macao, and the many options make for difficult choices, given the limited resources available to players. There also typically are difficult decisions to be made regarding whether to take resources in bulk regardless of type or take fewer of a type that may give you the right combination to activate a building. The paths to victory are varied and the the decisions along the way are always tough, which for me makes Macao a winner. One big caveat, however, for potential buyers: the graphic design on the cards is just awful. Instead of a picture of a coin, Alea chose to use the confusing initials GC (for gold coin). Instead of a picture of a cube, you pay and receive AC's (action cubes) and victory points become PP's (prestige points). Just to carry this crazy nomenclature to its extreme, you also acquire B/P cards (Building/Person). Terminology also is confusing. When you pay resources to put a card into play, you do not build it, but rather "activate" it. And while many cards can be activated each round, this is rather called "using" the activated card. The coins also are cheesy; a missed opportunity by Alea to enhance the theme a bit. So ... some terrible graphic and terminology decisions by a company that, as a veteran publisher of true gamer's games, should know better. But ... the stellar game play definitely makes this a keeper despite all the superficial flaws.

Macao's rotating compass rose--one for each player--is a stroke of sheer brilliance.  Do you want 1 resource, 1 turn from now; or 6 resources, 6 turns from now?  The downside is a blizzard of samey development cards that crowd the tabletop.  The result is oddly dense and  paths to victory are fragile.  Macao is too long by 1-2 turns.

RATING: 8
One of the most interesting use of dice I've seen in games. "When do I need what?" That's the crucial question that one is concerned with (or will be concerned) in a game that delivers plenty of scarcity and that is almost too overwhelming during this first session. 

Off into the book of games I'd like to play again but probably won't anytime soon. 
--------
Played again and this game is unique. Games with dice-based mechanisms have a tendency to either be or seem more innovative(sooner or later that'll wear out too) But even within this already innovative segment Macao stands out. I like the fact that each player has the same options when it comes to the choice from the pool of dice.Plus:I like scarcity games.

Macao uses a dice-manipulation mechanic in which one player rolls the dice at the beginning of each round. Players use the dice as a menu of action-points to choose from. There are six dice rolled, all different colors. If players choose a dice with a 1 on it, they'll get on action point (APs come in the form of cubes) in that color, and it will be used in the action round immediately following. If a player chooses a 2, they get two APs in that color for the following round, and so on, all the way up to choosing a die with 6 pips, and waiting to use 6 APs, but 5 turns later. The trick is taking cards that can be completed by the APs, and that will combo well for your plans. The hard part is knowing exactly how to plan for those since information is limited as players only know for certain of 2 cards that will be up for grabs at the start of each round. What's more is that players [i]must[/i] take cards to start each round, and you do it [i]before[/i] you roll the dice. So there's a bit of a hope-I-get-lucky element in every turn.

My concern going into the game is that there wouldn't be enough competition on the central board. But I was pleasantly surprised that there is. There are basically three things players are competing for on the central board: 

1. The Wall Race
This is strictly advancing your token further along a track. The track determines play order--which can be a big deal with other races on the board, and choosing your cards first each round--and it's also a tie breaker for final scoring.

2. City Locations
Players use APs to grab certain wares tiles in the city of Macao. They place ownership markers of their colors on those city sections, and will score 2x the number of their biggest connected network of ownership tokens.

3. Shipping
Each player has a ship that sails to distant markets overseas. They use the wares they've collected in Macao to deliver. The first player to arrive with wares, gets more points than those who come later.

I like the game. The dice-manipulation is simple and it keeps the game moving along at a decent pace. I honestly thought it would be a longer game than it ended up being, which is nice.

I have Trajan in my collection--another Feld title--and I think that with time, I'll feel compelled to choose between them because they share the same "feeling". In both games, you've got a unique action-selection mechanic that drives everybody's mini games going on on the central board. This one is lighter. There are less things going on than in Trajan. I also think the rond-cala in Trajan is a bit more brain burning than the windrose in Macao. I usually prefer heavier experiences over lighter ones. So my guess is Trajan will win the battle in the long haul.

I give Macao a 7 out of 10 after just one play. This is very subject to change with more plays.

An absolutely fun romp that may turn out to be a good game as well.  I'm so enamored with the clever windrose mechanism that I don't know if the game itself will have much lasting power.  The variety of cards that come out (since so many of them are out of the game each time) means you can't quite plan ahead (not to mention that your opponents may swipe the card you want just because it's cheap).  8 plays in, and I'm still enjoying this very much.

Update: The next 6 plays saw me getting progressively more disappointed with the game.  Not only are you at the whims of the dice, but you never know what goods you will need in the future since you don't know anything about the upcoming cards.  I really wanted to like this game, but the lack of control was too much for me to take.  

As a last ditch effort, we tried to tweak the game a bit to give us more control.  We overdid it the first time, making offices too powerful.  After taking a look at some of the variants suggested in the forums we gave it another try and the game was great fun again.  We'll have to hammer out the details on which of the variants we prefer, but it looks like Macao is back to stay!

First Impression:

A long eurogame attempt with very interesting mechanics and a somewhat working theme.

I loved the rondel (dice excluded) and first player selection and I liked the tribute system. The game flows well. Minimum downtime. Great scope and passable theme (which is an exception for Feld)

To Mr. Feld's credit, this is the best implementation of dice I've seen in a euro. It almost gives me hope that one day there will be a euro with proper use of dice. Not this one though. The game would really be better without them. As it is now, the combination of dice+cards makes for a very chaotic game. Skill plays also a significant role, but it's like playing piano in a brothel - it helps being mozart, but other "sounds" will probably dominate anyway.

All in all, I liked the concept and flow of this game, but I was highly dissapointed by the artificial chaos that the dictated use of dice creates.

RATING: 9
The game revolves around rolling six dice.  You pick up the number of resources corresponding to the number of the die, but you do not have access to those resources for the corresponding number of turns.  

The game then presents with ways to spend your resources which is highly skewed towards "getting there first."  This creates a delicate balancing act of generating more resources to be less effective later, or less resources to be more effective now.  With the randomness of the dice and card draw, its impossible to play perfectly.

Throw in the subgame of deciding whether to focus on shipping one or two types of goods, building a long chain of housing districts, being spread out in the resources you collect, hone in on a specific color, focusing on creating gold generating combos, drafting cards based upon the strength of the reward, focusing on easy to fulfill cards (etc. you get the point) while dancing through a sea of unknown and randomness.  

The game forces you to have a flexible plan, which makes it a beautiful thing.  The game has so many decision points, but combined with so much randomness with the dice rolls and the blind card draws.  It would seem the game is determine by luck, until you see the same person winning time after time.  It has a relationship between the dice and cards which was counter intuitive to me at first.    

This game is unlike any game I have played before.  It is incredibly rich and varied with so much to explore.  I can see how other gamers on this site are off put by the lack to perfectly execute their long term plan, but I can not recommend this game enough.  Probably not worth buying if you think you will only get to play this once or twice, but if not, there is a lot of game to investigate with repeated plays.

I think the "fun" is infused with the sense of gambling, without a sense of press your luck.  Namely, the two gambles on the GC to PP conversion, and selecting cubes based upon fulfilling missions early.  The gamble depends strongly on position in the game, contingency plans, and you ability to acquire a solid contingency plan.  This feel of gambling also gives the game a sense of something special.  Only four plays, so too soon for a ten, but damn I love this game.

Takes too long with 4 players (see Torres)
Should probably only be played with 3

I agree with Cymric on this one:
"In practice we found that the game is gearing up towards round 6 or 7, then really 'works' as the character engine shifts into high gear, and after that it's just going through the motions to the game end, obtaining as many points as possible. Frankly, we found the latter third part of the game boring as hell. You can't do much anymore at this stage if your engine isn't working at this point you simply lose"
I would sell if it weren't part of The Alea Collection

RATING: 6
SOLD (8/25/11) --- This is the kind of game that I particularly feel incapable of evaluating after a single play. However, I do know I want to play it again, which is a good sign. I tried Macao at BGG.CON (thanks to Dale Yu and his teaching prowess), and have been looking forward to an opportunity to give it another shot ever since. The one thing I do think for certain is that, while Macao is very different from Feld's two preceding Alea titles - Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon - it nonetheless feels very similar. Fans of Notre Dame and/or In the Year of the Dragon are certainly more likely to feel right at home with Macao. On its face Macao appears to be a kinder, gentler game than either of those, but underlying that I believe is a nasty engine that ruthlessly hands out negative points to unwary gamers. The game has prompted many to trot back out the phrase that was used incessantly upon the release of Yspahan a few years back - "it uses dice, but in an interesting/unique/clever way." Macao has the group collectively roll a handful of multi-colored dice, and then everyone individually selects which three dice they'd like to use. You then get action points in the color of the die equal to its face value, but don't receive them until X turns later where X equals the face value of the die. This is a very straightforward in practice because if you choose the red die showing a 2 then you get 2 red action points 2 turns from now, but if you choose the blue die showing a 5 then you get 5 blue action points 5 turns from now. You need these actions points to build buildings (different color action points build different types of buildings) that give you victory points and money (used for purchasing victory points of course). You can also use action points to advance on the turn order track (analogous to the Year of the Dragon turn order track), or to purchase chits representing various goods, or to sail your ship throughout Europe to deliver those chits for victory points. Did you catch that? You sail your ship throughout Europe. It doesn't make any sense. It didn't hit me until a fellow player pointed it out, but once she did I couldn't stop thinking about it. Just look at that board. You sail around to cities like Marseilles, Amsterdam, and Hamburg, and the space between them is all water. Is this some post-apocalyptic Europe where the entire continent has been flooded except for a few select cities? I smell a re-theme! Regardless, as you've probably gathered from the general description above, the theme is irrelevant because this is a game about the cleverness of the interlocking mechanics, in the classic Feld mold. The reason I say up front that I need to play more to properly evaluate Macao is that I can't say after one game how frustrating the die rolls will be and how much they'll ruin your best laid plans. I don't mind dice in Descent, Queen's Gambit, or War of the Ring, but in an Alea game about collecting action points to convert into victory points, dice playing too large a role feels very incongruous. It looked upon first blush as if there were potentially enough decisions in Macao to mitigate the dice, which I hope to confirm through subsequent plays.

This is a game that some people don't care for.

This is one of my favorite games. There is no real reason that I have to own this game.

A really clever use for dice in a game. Everyone has access to the same ones, but not everyone will want the same or even get what they wanted. This is just how the game plays. Many interesting choices that combine set collection, pickup and deliver, actions allowed by the amount of cubes (that you get through the dice) you have in every round.

Macao is a hard game to play - it is from a time when Feld didn't give you points for almost everything and actually liked to take away points! It is tough to control your cubes for actions, while having to build things, activate cards, collect goods, move your ship, fight for turn order, be ready to pay for points when the value is good. All this from the same pool of cubes. I loved it! But I definitely can see why someone could see is a chore!

For what it is worth, I think it is great, though awesomely dry on theme.

I was drawn to this despite a lot of reasons not to like it: Cards with special powers, lots of randomness, somewhat solitairish play, point-saladishness, weak theme, micromoves (in the boat movement), and the negative opinion of prominent geekbuddies.

I think it's pretty good though. Fun at least. I will list some factors that save it:
1. It plays quickly, at least until you have a ton to work with. You typically can't do very much on your turn especially early in the game.
2. Interaction is visible in multiple places: Wall position determines your card drafting and turn order. There's sort of an area control game with placing markers. When you have goods of a type there is a race to be the first to deliver it.
3. I also very much like that the dice outcome each turn applies to all players equally. If everyone were rolling the dice separately the randomness would be intolerable.
4. While the special powers on the cards are annoying, they aren't very complicated, and the cards also play a larger and more interesting role as liabilities that you need to "pay off" and get off your board so that it doesn't fill up and earn you punishment markers. This kind of reminded me of In the Year of the Dragon.

Uncertainty about whether the role of luck is too great (particularly in what cards come up and are available for you to draft on your turn) keeps my rating down a little bit. There is some intriguing promise that maybe through sufficient and clever planning I can make the stars align for me, but that may not be true.

Un puerto con distritos y mercancias, una empalizada y barcos que llevan las merancias a las islas. 12 turnos. Se escogen cartas por orden de la empalizada, se tiran dados de seis colores, se escogen dos dados cada uno y se ponen los cubos correpondientes en el numero correspondiente de la rosa de los vientos. Durante la accion puedes activar las cartas, comprar mercancia en distritos, transportarla en barcos a las islas o avanzar puestos en la empalizada, y al final cambiar monedas por puntos de prstigio. Te penalizan con PP por no tener provision de cubos en el turno siguiente, sexta carta en el tablero y cartas no activadas al final de la partida. Muy dinamico, tablero bonito y duracion justa

of the recent Feld games (Trajan, Castles and this), this is the heaviest thinker-planner, with the wheel of actions. But the gameplay on the board doesn't seem to match the level of thinking required to get there. Does that make sense? I don't know. To me, it is not as fun as the others.

Alea Big Box #13. I've read the rules and am ready to teach any time (bringing to Oasis of Fun in Atlanta 2010.) I taught Ben to play 2 player so I've finally had a chance to play, and its not that complicated, should be easy to teach multiplayer. Had a really deep and fun game (got my ass kicked) at Oasis of Fun in Atlanta 2010. Taught Brian and Jim, and it works really well as multiplayer, Jim thought it was too long for what it was worth.

After having played Trajan, The Castles Of Burgundy and Notre Dame, I consider Macao to be a typical Feld game. One of the early ones, that I enjoy more than his later titles. Macao is easy to teach and the huge deck of cards ensures replayability. It does seem to involve some more randomness than most Feld games however. Surprisingly good with just two players.

On the fence for this one. It is not a bad game. The rose wind mechanism is new and certainly is intriguing and requires some planning. But certainly, this game is a brain burner. Not for the faint of heart. We ended up playing for more than 2.5 hours on the first run. I like the tightness of the game, but did not enjoy all the minute card-counting toward the end of the game where you have to "activate this to get that and then triggering this to complete that". It is a little too tedious in my book. This game maybe elevated slightly if not for the sheer amount of text on the game. Need more solid plays before I can judge this game accurately

I really like the dice and wind-rose mechanic. Plays very well with two, am interested to see how it does with more.

Edit: Yes, yes and yes! Macao is easily my favorite of Feld's games. Tactical play with dice, planning ahead, and a great dash of luck and variety. While the correct combination of cards can make or break you, it never feels like you're doing poorly due to sub-optimal play.

While Burgen von Burgund has a similar feel, I vastly prefer this game due to it's larger planning element. Normally I fancy myself a tactician rather than a strategist, but when it comes to Macao, I get out my binoculars and scan the horizon with glee!

After 1 play. Not sure about this one. I like it less than Notre-Dame or In the Year of the Dragon after the first game. It seems to be harder to planify actions. It seems that the best trategy is to take the more cubes you can take and take buiding depending on the cubes you have.
After a second game where I always took the biggest dice result: I've finish second, three points behind the winner which has applied the same tactic and far away from third and forth that tried to tade cubes they needs.

The weakest Stefan Feld game I've played so far. I feel like I have very little control over what I'm doing - there is no chance mitigation mechanic like the workers in Castles of Burgundy. It's also far more fiddly, with literally 300 little action cubes in 6 different colors to sort and keep track of. The pick up and deliver element of the game feels tacked on.

The bland, stale theme and mediocre production values (sadly typical of Alea games) are also strikes against it. It shares these qualities with Castles of Burgundy, but in Burgundy's case I was willing to overlook this because of the superior gameplay.

I haven't felt this let down by a game in a long time. Perhaps I came into it with expectations that were too high-- my eternal fandom for 'In the Year of the Dragon' made any Stefan Feld an auto-buy for me. But, much like the tedium of the four hour bore-fest called Loyang, Macao is extraordinarily procedural.

My favorite feeling in a game is the tension from having way to much to do and not enough time to do it; I love that perfect and by-design torture of being pulled in twenty directions... wanting, no needing(!) to do it all. Right. Now.

Part of the frustration I felt with Macao is that for the first two to three rounds you do feel that gamey-goodness. Macao teases you, lulls you into thinking that you are about to play something great. But the longer the game progresses-- most oppressively in the last third of the game-- the more the choices are dictated by capricious dice rolls that collide (for better or worse) into an engine that is already too built to change.

A game like Macao offends by constraining your choices, squeezing them down narrow pathways until your work as a gamer is to simply eliminate untenable options and pick from the leftovers. While the compass-rose-dice-wheel-thing is fresh, it is also dictatorial: your choices are so narrowly determined by the fickle hand of fate that later, once you have access to the action cubes, the allocation feels limited and prescribed. 

In effect what this means is that the game comes down to drafting cards. Yes, you want to get some synergy. But the choices in each round of card drafting are also narrow. If you are pursuing a particular path because of what you have built already, the card drafting too is often obvious. This leaves the "game" in allocating dice rolls for action cubes. But here again the choices are constrained. You have to fill out all the empty spots or get dinged with negative points. And when you are free of that threat, you are left with this:
"One gray, two black are useless-- although four gray would have been great, to bad that isn't what was rolled-- I guess that leaves 4 green or 3 red... yawn."

Macao let me down not because it is a bad game, but because it gives the illusion-- but not the substance-- of a thinky, tense game. You want to build this fabulous engine and tweak the motor for maximum effect, but because the course you set for yourself often clashes with the confining and fixed possibilities of the dice, all that is left is for the monkey to pull the levers and for the engine to run itself.

Brian Bankler: "Feld’s formula — take a good (possibly great) idea and then bury it in 8 layers of crap."  Can't say it better (and after a single play of Trajan, I think Manacala is a better idea than the Wind-rose, though of course Trajan pushes the layers to eleven).  That said, I have quite enjoyed my plays of Macao, though I think that has been my reaction to succeeding at the game, rather than approval of the game itself.

RATING: 6
Euro that has some inventiveness behind its mechanics.  Feld's common struggle-against-the-game style is here, in the form of the punishment tokens that you take if you don't meet minimum thresholds for actions or building.  Theme is still pretty light.  We happen to be traders, this time traders from China.  The victory points feel just as arbitrary as usual, with bonus buildings and persons that you can acquire with the right combination of cubes.  As with most Euros, there's very little story to be had, beyond "I grabbed this slightly more potent card combination and was able to get more VPs than my opponents as a result."

The goods roll is definitely the star of this show.  Cards and punishment tokens will force taking some suboptimal rolls, and it's up to the players to decide when to sacrifice a bit to get what they need now, rather than later.  There's some juicy decisions here.  I wish the game would be a little longer and more involved, with structured building patterns like, say, [gameid=35677] to allow slightly more predictable paths to victory.  As it is, this is a very tactical game.

Controlled chaos, trying to manipulate things so that the dice and cards all work out for you. Did pretty miserable my first time out. Not helped by the wife who didn't read one of her cards fully, so received a benefit 8 or 9 times instead of the 2 or 3 she deserved.

Enjoyable, immediately left me with a "I need to play that again right away" feeling, which is always good.

A resource management game with dice, cards, etc.  There is a lot of stuff going on - reminds me of Hermagor in that way - with what appear to be multiple paths to victory.

RATING: 6
Macao presents a unique twist on the dice management concept. In Macao, 6 dice are rolled every turn (1 for each color resource). You get to take resources in two colors of your choice; the number on the die represents both how many resources you get and how many turns you'll have to wait for them. It is a tension of less now versus more later. The ultimate twist is that you can never store resources, so you must coordinate to get the color combinations you need. 

The juxtaposition of planning and randomness will be jarring to some people, but I've found the challenge an intriguing one. I think once you understand the dice odds and temper your expectations accordingly, as well as learn to work backwards from what you already have in hand rather than plan forwards to depend on particular dice rolls, then the game unveils itself as an enjoyable mid-weight experience. 

Finally, what I like about the game as well are the myriad of person and building cards. There are 120 or so cards included, but only 40 or so are used each game. They went with an Agricola variety approach so to speak, and it really adds to the experience. 

I'm usually down on games that are this self-absorbed/non-interactive, but Macao presents such a unique and interesting puzzle that I'm not too bothered by it.

Solid Feld game. Feels like a puzzle you are constantly trying to figure out. Planning ahead can be difficult but rewarding. Many ways to score.

RATING: 5
I have to admit, I really like the rotating turn mechanism, and how you can plan future moves based on what you roll, and where it goes.  Unfortunately, that seems to be the only real gimmick of the game, and the rest of it just isn't as interesting as that one part.  There's the race element of trying to be the first to get to the markets, and then there's the area control aspect of controlling the cities.  Neither one of those parts of the game are as new and interesting as that turn mechanism.  This isn't a game I would clamor to play, but it's not one I would turn down, either.

Only one play, so the rating will change.  Too many options for points makes it somewhat confusing when starting out in the game.  The wheel is a neat idea, but it just turns into one more thing that you have to watch to not lose points.  Getting the correct cubes for the buildings you want seems to be based on how lucky you are.

Before Macao, I didn't understand the infatuation everyone had with Stefan Feld. I didn't see the point of games that arbitrarily give you points for every action you take. My first game of Macao completely changed my perspective. The unique way the dice are used to generate resources and create a time frame for them to be delivered on a later turn was logistical puzzle I had never encountered before. It's fascinating trying to decide between instant gratification and investment for bigger rewards, all the while needing to sync up those shipments, large or small, so that they can be fully utilized.

Nothing in the game is even remotely thematically grounded. You are generating resources by collecting dice, to pay for cards and buy points. But the puzzle those resource dice create is so wonderfully challenging. Once I learned to love the logistical aspects of Macao, it blew the doors off my disinterest in point salad Euros. Now I'm grabbing Feld games as fast as I can find them and diving into their unique puzzles. I'm glad I get it now, because they really are some of the most satisfying games in my collection.

A bit of a strange combination of intricate planning and some pretty wild randomness here and there. Overall, I don't think agonizing over every little thing gets you all that much, so it's a game to play fast and enjoy the swings rather than optimize to all hell.

Really like the asymmetry of the B/P deck, as this is usually where euros get very parallel and "samey," but here you can see they tried.  The septagon works nicely, but I don't know how excited I can really get about "action cube allocation" on its own (and really: AC, GC, and PP instead of actions, gold, and points? ridiculous).

The overall package, though, is pretty fun.  A purchase I was unsure on, but I like alea, and I'm glad I took the plunge. Also, my wife likes it, so that's a bonus. I think alea is back (thank you, Stefan Feld) after some really bad choices (no thanks, Moon/Weissblum).

RATING: 7
My first 2-player game was rather disappointing. It's not a bad game, it's just that there's nothing about it that's particularly interesting. The tribute track shouldn't be in this game, it feels completely out of place. 

The windrose is very intriguing, but it's a weird mixture of tactics and strategy - you make those elaborate future plans, but you can still be screwed by dice on round-to-round basis and there's nothing you can do about it really. 

There are some cool card combos that may occur, but the way the cards come out is totally random and you can't really make long term plans regarding your engine. You don't see enough cards in a 2-player game. There's also not enough competition for wares. This is clearly a euro designed for 3-4 players. I will give it another go with higher player count - if it doesn't click with me, I'll sell it without regrets.

[b]/update:[/b] Bumped from 6 to 7. I played it again with three players. After a few plays the thought process behind every decision became more enjoyable for me. When you acknowledge the fact that you have to manage the risk and take more tactical rather than strategic approach to the game, the puzzle becomes more intriguing and less frustrating. The positives started to outshine the negatives, planning for those big turns can be really satisfying, but Macao as a whole is still far from being as good as Trajan or Bora Bora.

Components and artwork are excellent. Theme is good too. Size of box perfect. Mechanics are original and work excellently. Lots of decisions. Planning ahead, having to amend plans according to dice/cards. Some say too much luck - I don't. I agree with  the idea that there is randomness which every one has to manage.  This randomness does not lead to chaos, but rather I would argue adds to the replayability of the game. A must buy.

Surely it doesn't shine for originality of the theme (rrooonnn rrrooooonn...).
The game itself works correctly till the end. 
The fact is that, out of 12 turns, the first 5/6 turns are devoted apparently to almost nothing, that is, you don't perceive you are doing anything worth of the effort. 
The mechanics are rather original, and this saves the game from an insufficient rating, graphics is not outstanding for clarity (but it's nice). In the city of Macao is not particularly easy to see which parts are taken and which not (probably I am blind...).
All in all, not an overwhelming experience; i don't feel much like retrying it

RATING: 7
My preliminary rating of this game is based on a solo play (two-handed), so my opinion may change if I ever get to play against another person. I found that the bulk of the challenge of the game was in the initial selection of card and dice each round; after that, each turn pretty much played itself out mechanically. It's too long to be a quick filler, and while it's complex to the point that I suspect I will have trouble teaching it (meaning I likely won't have many opportunities to play it against others), it's not quite complex enough to be completely satisfying as a thinky solo puzzle. Thus, it kind of falls between the cracks at this point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What can I say? I quite like the die aspect and the element of collection, buying, shipping. I don't like the need to plan so far in advance and found that being forced to buy cards deterred from the game somewhat. It was fun and I would play it again, but certain elements were not my favorite. It is challenging but not in a particularly stimulating way- then again, it is not too challenging to turn me off of it. Rather, I will probably like it better once I get the hang of it.

In the Far East we are Portuguese traders trying to set up our shops in the quarters of the city to pick up goods tiles like tea, china, and jade.  We select and build office cards, influence local politics, and later in the game will ship our goods to markets back home in Europe.  Each player has a windrose that represents planning for future actions.  Different color dice and cubes represent different systems of the city.  One of the first games I can think of that forces you to commit to future plans.  Too dry for me and frankly too hard to balance the short term resource needs and committing to future turn plans which almost always go awry.

My initial plays left me a little uninspired, similar to Notre Dame - the sort of game I would always agree to play but not suggest or push to play. This is mainly because it is just too heavy for most occasions and runs too long, especially with 4 and as people get bogged down with their big turns late in the game. I can imagine with the right group who know the game there is some really great strategy and variation with the cards. However, I don't see myself able to unlock this value.
'17/12/03: I have concern about how the card draw is swingy - for example, you may have a card that synergizes with another, but that other card may never come up. I'm not sure how to mitigate this - if it comes up you're in luck, if not, you can do something else. The final few card draws are also quite swingy because you may or may not have the cubes to build them. You can mitigate this by piling up cubes on the last turn. It is an interesting game, just not a classic that I will return to.

Een heerlijk spel met een zeer origineel gebruik van dobbelstenen.

Spelers zijn handelaren in de vrije haven van Macao en handelen in allerlei goederen en verschepen deze naar de oude wereld. Ook al hangt het thema er in losse flodders aan, dan nog heeft dit spel een heerlijke combinatie van vooruitplannen en taktische zetten op de korte termijn. De grote hoeveelheid aan gebouwen die gebouwd kunnen worden en de dobbelstenen zorgen ervoor dat het spel iedere keer weer anders wordt ingekleurd, ook al blijft de essentie hetzelfde.

1 play, so rating is provisional. A lot of these Euros seem the same to me. Collect little coloured cubes to activate cards to gain points to move you round the victory track on the border of the board. Could have been Lords of Waterdeep. El Grande or whatever. What seemed amazingly unique to some (the rosette dice allocation thingy) just seemed like another randomisation method to me. Maybe euros just ain't my thing.

Interesting use of dice although the heart of the game is risk management when it comes to the cards. Great variability because of the huge number of (poorly translated) cards, leading to different strategies each game. Another Feld hit.

Amazing game that hits just the right mix of strategic vs tactical decisions for me. I love the card combos and "mega-turn" potential, but also needing to balance long-term planning with immediate needs and racing against the other players.

Hands down my favorite Feld, and I am a huge Feld fan.

RATING: 7
An exciting game that combines several interesting strategic elements.  I love the wind-rose which provides the perfect strategy/randomness tradeoff. Yet the strategic side is upset by a very large card deck that does not allow you to know if your strategy will pay off or not. I like Feld's designs and I like this one, my complaint is that there is a good amount of calculating and thinking while taking shots in the dark.

This feld has grown on me a lot recently, there is something very satisfying about the delayed gratification and super turns mid to end game, that bring me back to this time and again....

My favourite Stefan Feld game so far (I have not played all his games as yet).

I really love the theme and how the game plays. Highly recommended!

This game, and the wind rose in particular, fascinates me. There are enough ways to "push cubes, earn points" to mix strategies up game-to-game but it otherwise quite tactical. Though you really have to be on the ball to maximize your points (and minimize penalties), if you play it as "multi-player solitaire," you could be outclassed by players who are more aggressive against you (taking your cards, blocking your developments, delivering goods before you, etc.).

Fantastic! A bit dry, perhaps, but the dice rolling mechanism makes this different from most of our other euros.

RATING: 7.6
Definitely more complex than it seems. Requires a lot of planning to get the correct cubes to get cards in play. The cards should give it a lot of replay value and the components are decent. I liked the different paths to VPs in shipping, cities, prestige table, and cards. The rondel also makes things very interesting. 

Lower score for now but I expect it to go up with more plays.

This is quickly become my favorite dice management game.  The balance between alot of actions in a later turn vs. immediate need is very fun.  and the fact that everybody is basically pulling from the same resources, but playing different games.  Very fun yet pretty quick (only 12 rounds) game.

This is a good game, but it does suffer from having a card like the 'Wet Nurse' from Agricola.  Our group has played 3 times, and the person who got the card has won every game through its use, while the other players employed varying strategies effectively.

I like the plan for later rolling, making this the first game that uses dice in a way I like.

had some really good mechanics, and game play.  was a little bothered that so much of the time is spent warding off negative victory points for no gain.  also bothered by having lots of neat tiles and cubes, but nothing to do on the turn to improve the victory points.  the tie between the tiles and shipping needs to be much stronger.  still i like the use of dice and cubes placed around the dingus.  that all the potential tiles are layed out front i think just encourages too much AP, and would prefer if a more limited set were available.

A fantastic game!  An instant-hit with the wife and me.  Figuring out which dice to take, which cards to take, and which city tiles to buy make this a very enjoyable, strategic game.  The wind-rose mechanic is fantastic and really adds to the game.  The more I play it, the more I love it!

First play (3p) - 7 - I like the mechanics but my play was awful. I was thinking that I can play better as I know how the gameplay flows.
Second play (4p) - 6 - it was long, awfully random and there was a lot of downtime. Almost no way to plan anything
Third play (2p) - 4 - still it was random and you just can't plan anything ahead.

Good dice game. Different mechanic. Have yet to play with more than two players.

RATING: 7
Macao is a strange one and seems to have a conflicting design at its core.  It punishes you for not planning ahead, yet it discourages you from hoarding resources.  Combine that with the random nature of the dice roll and card draw, you can never be sure whether the colors you kept for future rounds will actually be of use.  I like the different take on the action point allocation, as well as the multiple paths to victory through the city quarter, goods delivery and prestige purchase.  Your strategy will be mostly dictated by the cards you acquire.

There are a lot of good ideas in Macao, but I think the disparity between the different elements of the game ultimately hurts it, as well as adding a lot of analysis into one's consideration that will more often than not prove to be useless.  I enjoy it but I don't love it, and I doubt it will ever become a favorite.

Update #1: After two more plays I've warmed up to Macao a bit.  I've decided to embrace the randomness rather than to fight against it, as a result, I actually found it to be a necessary charm to the game.  Yes, it is frustrating not to be able to plan to far ahead, but that is what risk management is all about.  It also make each experience different enough to warrant another look.

This is a Feld-game, what means that you’ll get a game with lots of possible choices and a pasted on theme. If you like Feld-games, you’ll also love this game. If you hate them, you’ll hate this one.

As we like Feld a lot, this was another one to get. Biggest minor point of this game, is also the biggest plus for this game. The windrose…. Very nicely done with the dice, and the way you can use this. You’ll have to decide if you want to do a long- or a short-term planning. Pain in the ass, as it comes to turning the windrose to the next round. This is were it should have come with an extra board for storage of the cubes and the possibility to mount the windrose on the board with a plastic screw.

Not too difficult to teach to other players. Enough depth to stay interesting to advanced players. Just another very nice game (or maybe we should call it great) of Stefan Feld.

A few months after my first few plays, I'm raising my rating from 8 to 9.  I'm not sure any game uses dice better than Macao.  A wonderful blend of heavy strategy and light tactics.  Dry as any Euro, but so satisfying.

Ooh, brilliant logistical, speculative, gambling agony!

Macao is a great one for the masochist in all of us.  Its core mechanism is a heptagon for each player, depicting the six values on a die, and an arrow.  There are six colors of [i]action cubes[/i], and the corresponding six dice in those same colors.  Each of the twelve turns, the dice are rolled, and each player may take cubes according to two dice of her choice.  If I choose the 5 that rolled on the blue die and the 2 that rolled on the red die, I take 5 blue, and put them outside the 5 position of my heptagon, and put 2 red outside the 2 position of my heptagon.  Next, the heptagon rotates clockwise, and the action cubes at which it points are my very ephemeral supply for this turn.  Those are the only ones I can use this turn, and this is the only turn I can use them — leftovers get discarded.  The other thing that happens each round, and before the dice are rolled, is a forced draft of one card per player.  Those cards have costs of 1-4 cubes in 1-4 colors.  Of course, our dear Stefan likes to motivate the players through punishment, so you are punished every time you let those cards accumulate too much on your board (i.e. without "activating" — buying — them).  There are two other types of punishment, as well.  The good part is that the cards you activate are yours to use for the rest of the game, and they enable you to do special things.

Macao is a game that encourages repeated plays to try out different methodologies, and because there are dice involved (as well as opponents, of course), it may take several tries just to execute one methodology successfully.  In the first four days after opening it, we'd already played it three times.  It would have been four, but we were too sleepy the third day from starting it late at night the first two....

One "issue" this has in common with [thing=31594][/thing] is that you [-]basically must[/-] almost need to vie for start player.  [-]You can't[/-] It can be tricky to win off the table scraps.  Knowing that, however, play and have fun!

Another problem is that, due to the tactical nature of the individual turns, there's a little more downtime than I would prefer; however, it's not too bad.

Competing with Aquasphere for my favorite Feld ever. The wind rose is a fantastic mechanism that requires so much good planning. And when you have a turn where all your plans come to fruition, it's amazing! The first few turns seem really slow and boring but it picks up a lot in the second half as you get more cubes to use.

Solid game - haven't played it much, but it has nice mechanics and seems to reward strong eurogamers.  However, it won't be back at the WBC thanks to Rafael Lehrer not submitting his GM report.  

All together now...

Rivals Luna for my favorite Feld title.  I suspect that blowing off early game planning for a plethora of resources mid to late game works more often than it doesn't, but the game is a good ride no matter what.  Possibly AP inducing the first time through as the options are legion.

Clever new mechanism (at least for me the first time I saw it) with the dice and resource selection. There's a lot going on and hundreds of different possibilities and ways to play. On the downside, everyone is playing a bit for themself, especially if you want to speed up things. Overall a worthy Alea game but no new No.1 or even Top 10 if you ask me...

Lowered the rating to a 7 after some time has passed and I played it again. Still a very good game.

Nice mechanism, but that says it all. We're used to better Feld games. After round 8 there's too much down time. In Burgund or Trajan, which are equally long games, every round takes the same time. Not so in Macao ...

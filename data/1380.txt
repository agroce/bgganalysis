RATING: 3
Race game which uses a mechanic similar to Detroit & Cleveland Grand Prix. Sadly, each card only moves one horse, often over large distances. This removes a lot of control over the proceedings.

RATING: 8
Always had immense fun in this race game. The uncertainty of who has backed each horse overshadows the actualk outcome of the betting.

Another game that's follwed me through from my garage sale days in the 80's. There are only two things wrong with it: 1) THe foam rubber backing on the play mat has succumbed to dry rot, and 2) I can never beat my wife at it.

Chaos....basically a card game with a horse theme wrapped around it.  Looks pretty good for an older game, but the gameplay is ehh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
2 plays (4p, 5p)-- like it. Moves quickly. First game ended up with $5,500; winner had $6,200 based mostly on a wild round 3 bet. 2nd game I had I think $1,500, based only on a last round 1st place pick. It inspired a discussion of luck via chaos. It certainly is helpful when other players' bets coincide with yours, but it helps them too. Until I play it more to further my opinion, I would just like to say, "Jockeys like to party!" (Always Sunny in Philadelphia)

Published in the [[Ravensburger Casino Series]], but owning the regular Ravensburger edition.

The right mixture of fun and frustration make this an engageing game to play. One session of play takes 3 races. Winner is the player with most cash in hand at game end.

RATING: 6.5
A surprisingly nice vintage around a theme which, at the beginning, i didn´t gave much credit: Bets around horse races! 
Players secretely bet some chips in one or two horses from a set of four, according to each own set of cards held in hand which came from an initial draft.
Some of the cards held in hand push for a specific horse but others push for any horse that happens to be in a certain position during the race, 2nd, 3th or 4th. So, it might be useful to let "your" horse lose some ground, only to give it later a more relevant push...
Very straight foward, the game goes smooth and easy, and it´s all over just after some 30 min.
Near this column you might read "Prev. Own" and ask yourself why is that, well...yeah, you got it right - my mother gave it away in a donation...

It's one of those games which are used to end a game evening. Fast and fun, no much strategy and lots of luck, but hey that's what betting on horses is all about...

RATING: 7
This game seems pretty simple but there is much more planning than what originally meets the eye. Knowing when to use which cards. Knowing that some times its best to not touch your horse letting him fall to the back of the pack and then with a couple of quick plays of the (+30 to within 5) or the (4th place +20) cards huge amounts of turf can be made up and your last place horse might indeed finish first. Also trying to figure out just what cards you have and who you should bet on based on those cards  and then playing the cards in the proper order to best make use of your particular cards is challenging.

I remember this game fondly!  Enough to pick up another copy, YEARS later... Too easy to win money, but there is some nice strategy.  I question the 12 and up age range: it is the difficulty or the fear of the gambling aspect?  I cannot believe the former.

RATING: 6
Plays fast and furious, generates a great racetrack atmosphere. In a way I prefer it to Knizia's take on horseracing, as there is not much thought or planning in Jockey; games take 30 mins and are involving throughout. Of course, this means that the outcome is also fairly random... Well, it's fun randomness, so I don't mind

Very decent and fun horse racing game that I received as a kid (somewhere in the early 70's). 

Raters that complain of lack of control for some reason don't understand that this is not a 'race'-game but a betting-game (with a lot of bluff added): when determining on which horse(s) to bet, don't just look at you own cards, but try to deduce what cards the other players have (and thus will bid on).

GOOD: 4 metal horses, race-track (see below), betting pad and complete set of great condition cards.

NOTE: Rules printed off of BGG.
NOTE: Missing money. A pad & pencil could keep track of bets.
NOTE: Race-track felt surface in good condition, but rubber underneath falling apart.

Vecchissimo gioco, ormai raro, poco conosciuto ma che consiglio. Siamo alle corse dei cavalli, abbiamo un piccolo capitale e la possibilità di scommettere sul vincitore e sul piazzato. Una volta fatta la puntata, grazie alle carte in nostro possesso già prima della puntata, dobbiamo far di tutto per far arrivare al traguardo i cavalli come più aderente alle nostre puntate. Gioco diverte e veloce. Molto piacevole ma anche semplice.

RATING: 9
Casino-Edition / really nice tactical game of bluffing/double-guessing and wagering that actually feels like a Knizia. It's not a pure racing game in the sense, that you control one horse and try to let it win. You try to let the horses win, that you have bet on, but you also move other horses. You rarely have enough good cards for "your" horse to win, so you need to hide your bets good enough by good bluffing so that your opponents help you with their cards. A lot of tension is in this little game and a lot of horse wagering atmosphere. But my impression is: don't play with more than 4 people, it will lack control then. With two players luck is nearly not present and it's a pure tactical game where you will need to outwit the other player. Players who rate it low probably only played it with too many players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat racing game with hidden betting (leads to lots of bluffing). I think it will work better with more players. This way, horses that don't have bets placed on them don't get stuck behind (thus rendering the come from the back +20/+30 cards useless!).

Well produced and will make a good filler.

First Ravensburger edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played the version at Yucata.de, called Race. Differences:
- one lap only
- simplified betting: merely bet on 2 horses to place; payoff based on their finishing position
- track is shorter, with cards weakened accordingly

Compared to Jockey, Race seems a bit too random (single lap, betting system both make outcome less skill-based). I'd probably rate Race 6; I'll give Jockey a +0.5.

I wish I could give two ratings. One for the rating when I was a kid. I loved this game. Easy to learn, fun to play. 20 Years later I got me the game for my game group and was disappointed. To easy, not much control. If you have kids keep the game otherwise it is waisted space in your inventory. If you really like a race game get Ave Caesar.

update:  did i say filler?  pft.  you can make an entire gaming night out of this game.  its one of those rare games where we are all on the edge of our chairs rooting for the horse we want to win.  its a very vocal game that really shouldn't be.

RATING: 6.8
[EDIT]: after a few plays, I must say it is not that stupid as a game. You can play it in different ways and there are different strategies you can use to reach the victory, even in 2.

------------------
Simple but moderately fun. Not much control, some tactics, very small amount of strategy.
Quite meaningless with 2 players

Played the online version on Yucata.de called "Race"

RATING: 6
Fast horse racing game. You bet on the 1st or 2nd place horses and then try to make that happen. there are only 4 horses so the more players the more horse move before you get to play again. It can be over quick.

RATING: 3
After 1 Play: This felt like the mangled carcass of a better racing game, such as Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix. The cards are designed to keep the pack tight no matter what, in order to give the illusion of tension, but the winner is completely random

A good horse-racing game.

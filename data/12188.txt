Probably one of the most true to theme games out there.  Very nice artwork.  Bit of a deduction game that can be played relatively quickly, and is relatively straightforward to explain.  Watch out for those weeds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Only one play.  It isn't until the weeds start appearing that you realise how much is going on here.  Like all good games,  you want to do far more than is possible, and there is an excellent blend of helping yourself and hindering your opponents.  Weeds are vicious!

RATING: 7.5
At first I was going to rate this a 7 but after a couple of days of thinking about it, I boosted it.  It's a tight game with some great choices to be made.  The weeds are wicked if you do not work the first half the game to keep them at a minimum.  It has me thinking about the next game, and that is good.  I have the newer version which is very nice.  Nice tiles, artwork on the tiles, clean and clear.  I thought it played well with three.  You got to worry about yourself but yet you have to try and send some weeds to your neighbors to get into your competetors yards.  My one neighbor's yard looked like my real yard.  LOL  I think the theme fits well, too.

Played with five, very cool with five.  At the end, there didn't seem like anything to do the last round if you had your weeds under control and all the flowers that were relavent were gone.  I can't boost it up because of that.

Looks like an interesting game, but the price and the shipping costs are high enough that I can't afford it.

RATING: 7.5
Didn't see how this could have enough tension to keep me interested, and then the weeds appeared and things got interesting.  Deduction aspect is only moderate (in my opinion).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The game is thoroughly over-designed and the theme is ridiculous and arbitrary.  

Don't even get me started with the whole "weeds" mechanism which requires a PhD degree to understand, and which requires you to pass seeds and weeds and who the heck knows what else to your left and your right (still not sure in what order) at random times of the game.

[ Note, in fairness to the author:  we played on a very early copy with very rough boards and I was in a particularly cranky mood.  Perhaps the game has been refined a bit since.  Perhaps.]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Feels like a game that could be great with a little more development, but as it is, it's just so-so.  The hidden scoring is somewhat interesting, but creates a weird follow the leader dynamic.  If one person buys a rose, everyone buys a rose until there are no more roses left.  Scoring seemed like kind of a crap shoot, and didn't make for very interesting gameplay.  With some more polishing, I think this game could be a 7 or 8, but it just falls a little flat as it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game, easy rules, plays fairly quickly.  It's not a great game, and you can get stuck on a turn having nothing special to do if you don't watch out.  It slows down a little after the weeds start coming out, which gets a little fiddly.  I might give it a 6, but it felt unique, so it gets a point for standing out.

I've been itching to play this and finally tried it at the BGG con. It was very much what I expected but thats because the description is accurate not because its a bad game. The elements all work together to make a interesting game. Its worth owning just so you can bring it out for your wargaming buddies. Nothing gets the conversation going like are you thinking of planting Roses or Tulips. Right now for me I'd buy it if it was a better price. On a side note the women do seem to like this game so it would be a great game for the family or a couples night.

Clever system of choice-optimization along with memory elements.  Little player interaction, but considering the theme, that's appropriate.  Decent-quality components, for a game produced out of one's home - laminated mats, thick counters.

Second edition is a very beautiful game with high quality components.  Easy to learn, yet game play has a bit of interesting light strategy.

RATING: 7.5
Pleasant garden game with fiddly weeds mechanic. I like the deduction nature of the game and the different kinds of flowers. Don't really like how fast weed grows, but I guess it captures how annoying real-life weeds can be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Interesting game where you're trying to accumulate points by planting flowers according to what you think the judges are looking for.  Also adds an interesting twist with weeds added in the second half of the game that can be extremely annoying.  May be a bit long for what it is though.  Better with more players.

I have one big issue with this game: no garden gnome.  Where is the garden gnome?  Will there be a garden gnome expansion?

You'd have to be a vegetable to not have Garden Competition grow on you.  Ha Ha! Get it?

Ok, ok, sorry.  Anyway, Garden Competition is unique.  It's a great mix of a puzzle game, deduction and area control with a perfectly executed theme.  I couldn't help but think of the rival gardens in the Wallace & Gromit movie when I played this.  Maybe a rabbit expansion is in order?

Maybe I'm being a bit generous, there's a lot in this game I should like.  And I enjoyed it.  Just the right amount of 'up hill' battle and a little bit of several different mechanisms working together.  But, somehow it just didn't have a 'wow' factor to it.

What starts out as a typical euro engine suddenly changes into an all-out war with your neighbors as the weeds show up about halfway through. The weeds are what really make this game interesting. Without them, you have a boring, fiddley, poorly-produced game. The theme doesn't do much for me in terms of excitement, and the graphic design puts me to sleep. There's a lot of bookkeeping as well. It's not a bad game, and it plays nice and fast, but it just doesn't get me excited for some reason.

RATING: 7
02/09/10 - On a first solo play this is a very nicely integrated game.  It reminded me a little of Agricola coming out of the box, but it doesn't play that way, though by the end of the game there are still plenty more actions to choose than you have time to take.

The two actions per turn seem sufficent to start but once the weeds start popping...

Nice integration of actions, theme and play. I think this one will be a real keeper - 7 initial rating.

Solid light-medium game that mixes money management, majorities, and hidden-but-deducible goals.  The most unique thing about the game is the way that weeds spread, which turns the second half of the game into an interesting balancing act.  Very brisk gameplay, as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Expect the guys to be thinking hard about how to save their gardens from an onslaught of weeds and wondering why Doug just bought tulips. The game's mechanics are fairly familiar, but one novel idea is having a mini non-player board placed between players (The Next-Door-Neighbor) that can spread weeds from one player to the next. The game play is solid and would get a 7 in my book, but the excellent execution of theme is what really sets this game apart and why I'm scoring it an 8. This game is a unique creation in the game hobby - and it works.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
There seems to be more rules than game here.  At its core, players know some scoring cards but not all, and then plant "flowers" based on the victory conditions he is aware of - trying to discern what other players know.  However, the hidden aspect is not very interesting.  A player plants a rose - you try to plant a rose.

However, there is a lot more to the rules.  There are tile placement issues, majority fights, and more.  Problem is - none of it is very tense.  There needed to be greater consideration given to what really works to make the game involving, rather than to just build in lots of mechanisms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is classic Euro: simple rules, no luck, a benign theme that obscures some subtle player vs. players action. Feels a bit solitaire-ish, until you realize how quickly the desired seeds disappear from the nursery and you have to out-favor your opponents for the good flowers. I wasn't blown away, but this is fun and the theme works. And I think the weeds have potential to make some endgames very interesting.

RATING: 4
The game seems to suffer from lack of development.  I must admit that the homemade nature of the game may contribute to this opinion, but something seems wrong with the game.  There is a lot of guesswork and randomness in the judging cards, and certain flowers can sell out so quickly (especially if there are only two of them) that sometimes it comes down to where you sit in the turn order.  The rules could definitely use some cleaning up, but they are adequate.  Even so, they seem unintuitive for some players.  For me, the theme is an asset with this game, though others are more skeptical.  I have the same problem with this game as I did with Hameln.  The theme is there, I can understand how things work thematically, but mechanically the game seems to be a mesh of parts that work, but not smoothly.

RATING: 5
Garden Competition is an interesting blend of deducing from other players' actions what the judge is looking for in the flower competition, a little bit of area influence/majority in trying win the favor of neighbors and receive free gifts, and preventing the asiduous spread of weeds.  Weeds negatively effect your final score and can be very severe BUT can practically be eliminated from the game if people care to spend their actions to do so.  I prefer this game with 4 or 5 but its okay with 3.  I'm not thinking three doesn't work well AND I'm wondering if weeds shouldn't start earlier in the game.  There is just something missing from the game that I can't really put a finger on - other than perhaps a lack of tension when playing the game most times.

RATING: 7.7
A definitely unique blend of mechanics that seem to work very well together. This title offers a lot in a short amount of time. The rules and play time are shorter than you might expect from a game that turns out to have quite a lot going on. You only have 2 choices out of several options to make the most out of your turn. The biggest gotcha in this game for newcomers are those weeds, you have to nip them in the bud or they will start growing exponentially!

RATING: 8.1
Rating after 3 games. I am loving this game right now (November 2008). The theme is a turn off to some, but I love it too -- growing the types of flowers in your garden that the judges want to see while trying to prevent the weeds from overtaking them. This is an example of a theme that is well integrated with the mechanics making the gameplay seem intuitive. It is a unique mix of mechanics that work very well together. A little area majority, a little deduction (more like follow-the-leader) and a very effective mechanic that spreads weeds between yours and your neighbors' gardens. I haven't met a gamer yet who hasn't enjoyed this game once they have played it. In addition, the new edition is absolutely beautiful (with the exception of the tiddly winks for money)! Amazing considering this game is self-produced by the designer. This game surely deserves a wider audience -- so much so that I plan to GM it at my next local game convention. Positives: Beautiful presentation, interesting and effective blend of mechanics, sufficiently gamerly, unique theme. Negatives: the money, definitely better with 4 than 5, slightly pricey due to it being only available directly through the publisher.

Not certain it has sustained variability for continued play.  This is after one 3-player game, but adding the fun of 4 or 5 players will mean that this simple process will extend beyond the 100 minute mark.  It's also quite fiddly.

My dislike for this game is based 70% on it's theme...  it doesn't appeal to me at all.  Sharing resources with your neighbors is a mechanic I'd like to see in other games.  Admittedly I was playing under incorrect assumptions for scoring, but this points out a need for either a rule summary or a couple of cheat sheets.

Really, this game is ingenious.  It functions both as a very clever Eurogame and as a thematic experience game.  If you think that gardening is dreadfully boring, then you will be pleasantly surprised by the vicious weed spread.  It is a lovely engaging system that really needs to be more readily available.

UPDATE: The new version is out!

RATING: 6.5
I really like the novel concept of how the weeds affect the other players and for a small-scale publishing, the quality of components is pretty good.  Still, the game seemed to miss the compelling decisions and it was a bit too easy to determine the judge's criteria based upon the actions of the other players.  Also, I thought the game dragged on a bit.  Would like another play with more players to see if the rating changes (first play was with 3 players).

I can see the seeds of a good game here, but the scoring system needs to be refined and simplified.  There are just too many ways to score.  Also, there isn't enough tension each turn.

Positively the best game about gardening competitions I've ever played.  Actually it plays surprisingly well, and offbeat themes are always a plus for me.  With only 24 possible actions per player per game it's possible that this might get a bit stale after a while.  But I'd definitely play this again and again, at least for a while.  It's quite good.

Fun mostly for it's novelty value, yet there has been some decent thought into the balance and mechanics.  I love the idea of having to 'meet your neighboors' and help them do chores for cash and favor.  We definitely learned that picking weeds is vital before they spread!  Also that the last turn is probably always going to be 2 actions of weed picking.  Interesting that you want to pick up small flowers if given the choice, yet the large ones both can get you more points and fill up your garden; eliminating more space for point-scoring flowers yet on the positive side, eliminating space for nasty negative point weeds!

A very pleasant game with some surprising depth to it.  I haven't had this much fun in a long time.  The deduction aspect seemed rather superfluous and underdeveloped.  Too bad it's reduced down to just copy what other players are planting in their respective garden.  The spreading of weeds is both brilliant and painful.  Regardless of your feeling towards the theme, this is an experience everyone should have at least once!

RATING: 8
I like Garden Competition a lot.  The theme is unique and the mechanics mesh well with the theme.  You're able to plan ahead (with seeing what's coming up in the following round(s)) and there are limited actions (reminiscent of Princes of Florence).  Lots of good stuff going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The nature of predicting the yet-unknown "preferences" of the judge can easily result in an animated 15-minute discussion after the game is done.  Underestimating the devastation power of the weeds can kill you:  Weeds unchecked keep doubling.  This is a rather good game.  On one hand, you have to be willing to accept that you know a minority of the point-giving factors, and must try to observe or guess at the rest; on the other hand, you have an absolutely cruel two actions per turn, which is insidiously meager.  The garden competition is coming up, and you have to prepare for it in your minimal spare time; however, it's a worthwhile competition!

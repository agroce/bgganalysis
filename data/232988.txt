It's hard to keep track of everything going on, especially when you've got to mark up your game board with pencils and can make mistakes. You might get frustrated with many turns not being able to do anything because of what is rolled.

Surprisingly good.  Didn't feel too much like [b]CoB[/b] original, but it had a good character and flow.  The shortest of the games so far.  Looking forward to laminating the boards.  Almost a little small, if you can believe it!

RATING: 6.5
Neat little dice game from Stefan Feld which comes in a small-sized, portable boxed. I like the idea of a more complex roll and write game (more complex than Qwinto or the upcoming Roll to the Top!).
The artwork of the sheets is okay. The sheets are almost too small for all the printed on tiles. Sometimes you loose track of tiles you already own. Moreover, the game is abstract: after each roll you have to look up the matching colors and values of the dice which is not that much fun and lengthens the game. The puzzle and decision-making is good for this kind of game, but not fun enough to keep it. 

Players: 1-5
Time: 15-30m

RATING: N/A
Similar to the full Castles of Burgundy, except the dice aspect makes it feel like it should be a quick game (when options take just as much time to figure out) and everyone having the same dice to pick from led this game to feel "samey".

I'm guessing that this is not the normal outcome, as we may have just been bitten by groupthink, but it didn't lead to a great experience.  I'd rather play the full game than this, and I'd rather play other games than the full game.

Finally! I've found most roll-and-write dice games to be disappointing, primarily because they get more and more restrictive as the game goes on: as spaces get used up, you have fewer and fewer places to expand to. 

Here, you are limited at first, but then see your options open up for you as you go along. You can then make it even more open by trying to diversify your available numbers. It's much more satisfying. Of course, you also want to close off regions to score early. A very nice dice game, definitely a keeper.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great roll and write game that is thinky and fun, that really keep all the feel of its big brother.
++ You really have to think in order to keep your options opened, to make the best use of the random dice rolls.
++ Even though it's easy to learn and play, it's somewhat hard to master (i.e. to consistently have great score).
++ Great travel game since it's a super portable game by its size and can really be played anywhere with its really small footprint required. And as a bonus it support solo play!
++ Super easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- As a lot of people have complained, the pencil should have come with an eraser. But this is no big deal, as we can supply our own (and also our own small pencil sharpener).
-- For the solo game, the randomness of the dice roll is higher as you just want to beat your high score (so for a given duchy, better rolls will end up in a better score). But, this is not really the case in a multiplayers game as all players used the same dice rolls to achieve the scores we compare at the end of the game.
-- This is fine with us, but for the record, this game is multiplayer-solitaire (like a lot of game of this type) as the only player interaction is completing all hexes of one color before the others).

Ick, ick, ick. Not at all a fan of this admittedly unique design (a dice game 'simplified' by another dice game). The scoring sheet is very dark and tiny, making it nearly impossible to see what you've marked. There are also a ton of rules in place which burden the simple dice selection considerably for no other reason than that the game demands certain aspects of the original to be present. It reminded me painfully of the ill-fated Tigris & Euphrates cardgame, issued a lifetime ago. That box... just didn't work in the way it was supposed to. It carried over so many rules that the simple card core was overloaded. This is exactly what is happening here too.

Go play the card game. Or the original. Better in all respects.

Made a PnP copy.

Great little dice chucker that plays so quickly, you eyes never leave your sheet to see what others are doing. Tends to run itself for the most part, since there are often times you simply score the hexes that match your dice, still it is pleasant to play for the excitement of accomplishing mini goals.

Don't expect a terrible amount of depth. Replayability comes from the gambling element and not any need to try different strategies.

* Make sure you don't make the same rules mistake we did first time playing, of buying up to 2 hex per shake of the dice. It made the game end quickly and dumb.

Quickly losing interest after 15 solo games. It's a totally solitaire game without an iota of player interaction, yet designers did not design an AI for solo play.  So the more I play the more I ask myself, what is the point of this game? Who exactly is this game supposed to appeal to? A low price point, but also a disposable game with very limited replayability. Glad I made my own version and didn't buy it.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2018)

I love The Castles of Burgundy, it is the best Feld game IMO and I always want to play it, later, they released The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game which is a good game, but it is a lesser game than the parent game. I was expecting something better than the card game from the dice edition, but I’m still not sure if I like the game enough or not. 

The rules of the game are easy to explain, but there are many rules. You can explain them under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 1 hour, but I think this time can decrease a lot if players are familiar with the game.

The theme is cool, but pasted on. I like that it conserves some of the essence and art of Castles of Burgundy.

The game´s components are ok. The sheets are too obscure so the pencil markings aren’t clearly seen. I will laminate some of them and use colored markers.

In this game a player has to roll 4 dice and each player use them as best as they can so the luck doesn’t bother me at the beginning as it affects players the same way (most of the time), later, as players need different colors/numbers, luck plays a more relevant role. I don’t care much in any case as the game plays fast and it is light. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very complex. It is a family level game.

It seems the replayability factor is low. If the players start at the same location, their cities will develop in a similar fashion. I would have liked more sheets with different layouts.

Best with 2 players.

In The Castles of Burgundy: The Dice Game is very easy to cheat, intentional or unintentionally, and that bothers some friends. Still, it would be nice to see what other players are doing, but it is hard to do so in this game.

Bottom line, The Castles of Burgundy: The Dice Game is an ok game. I´m still undecided if I like the game or not. It can be interesting or perhaps it can bore me. I need more plays to verify. It is fun to throw dice so I will keep it for now.

Unlike the card game this actually plays quite a bit faster than CoB. They also managed to get some sort of CoB feeling in the game. However, it's more of a CoB themed diced game than it is a dice version of CoB. 

Compared to other dice games this one falls well short of average, let alone excellent. The main issue is the almost complete lack of interaction. Specifically, there is no interaction where the dice are concerned. Players have their heads firmly down, and if they were to lift them they would have a horrendous time trying to scan someone else's sheet from across the table. The sheets are hard enough to decipher when they're right in front of you.

FUN: this a roll and write game that I can see myself enjoying longer than other games in the genre. Maybe Roll Through the ages is better, but this is a lot less work.

UNIQUE: I enjoy the added push your luck system coupled with the irregular advancement of time.

NEGATIVES: the sheets are difficult to read. This not nearly as good as the cardgame, so I will probably always pick that over this game.

There are some clever ideas here, but it really is just a solo game. I did enjoy my first three plays, but the game is marred by a very small and dark map, and it is very difficult to discern what you've marked. I think it's fine for a twenty minute diversion, but it lacks dynamism and long-term interest.

Nice implementation of the original to a dice game. Since it is a pure dice game, you need to be lucky with the dice and sometimes you need to gamble for the next dice roll, if you're lucky you win, otherwise you lose the game. It's super fast, 15-30 minutes depending on the amount of double sand timers rolled. The papers should have been printed a bit lighter imo so you could easier see what you encircled but apart from that a pleasant experience. Definitely the lesser game of the CoB trio but still a decent roll-and-write game. You should be careful though not to make mistakes.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I will try any roll and write game I can find and usually they are cheap enough that I'll take a flier and buy them without much hesitation. I already played and didn't really care for CoB: The Card Game, but I thought a quick dice game based on a heavier dice game could work. And while it does, the game feels overdone. CoB: The Dice Game is rules heavy when compared to the greats in this genre [i](which in my opinion are Qwinto, Qwixx and Noch Mal)[/i]. In the end you are still solving a spacial puzzle based on numbers, but there are a lot of rules surrounding how you can manipulate/place dice which loosely tie in to the mechanics of CoB. I think some folks will like this game and appreciate the added complexity, but the complexity is really based on having to earn a bunch of special powers to be able to do anything interesting on your turn. A huge part of my obsession with roll and write games is that the rules are simple and easy to teach, but behind that there are some thinky decisions to be made. 

I consider Qwinto to be an elegant design for what it is trying to accomplish in the board game space, whereas Cob: The Dice Game feels clunky and honestly not to fun to play. You have too many turns where you really can't do anything with the dice that are rolled or the decisions are fairly obvious. CoB: The Dice Game lacks any real tension that comes from the players' choices; the only tension in the game is caused by bad die rolls. 

I'm glad I tried it, but I can't think of any games I've really enjoyed that are a "... the card/dice game" of a heavier game [i](I really like Roll for the Galaxy, but that isn't a simplified version of RftG)[/i].[/i]

It is a multiplayer solitaire game but for what it is - a roll and write game - it is brilliant. I am usually not so keen on dice/luck driven games, but this one lets you manipulate the dice results as in the big CoB. Different starting positions and four different set ups guarantee for some replayability and it's sooooo quick.

This was one of the coolest plays I've had. TheOneTar Youtube channel did a live play through and invited the audience to participate. I printed the available sheet and played along (not live, but of the later posted video). So, I got to log a play with them along with Nettersplays and Maggibot! The game was a lot of fun. It was a fun puzzle to figure out where you should go, what bonuses to shoot for, and when to use those bonuses. All points are received from finishing areas based on what round you completed them, and also for shipping. A decent little roll and write game that has a little more too it than the typical one. I highly recommend checking it out. It might not hit my collection since I already own La Granja: No Siesta which gives me a similar overall experience.

very opportunistic game with little strategy; difficult to get the combinations you want, and the dice manipulation is very limited; player sheets are very small and hard to read, and the rulebook does not explain scoring at all (scoring is not difficult, but it should be referenced in the rules; there are 4 different maps, but they occur in different places throughout the book of player sheets, making it very difficult to extract the one you want to use without separating the book

1 play, 4er, where I totally screwed up the orange rules!

A roll-and-write game that keeps much of the theme of the base game. It also shares a problem from the base game: pretty pictures on the hexes that don't actually tell you what the hell the hexes do! Fortunately it's much simpler in this game since there are only 6 things (legal dice for each of the colors) to remember, and the key to that is right there on the left of your sheet. And yet I still forgot how orange works! How easy would it have been to put the little "=" on the hexes on the board? Also, the icons and paper sheet is a little small for these old eyes of mine. 

In addition to production issues, the game play just isn't very interesting. Everyone uses the same die roll, which is nice to minimize random luck. But then, because of the small board, people end up building similarly. The strict building rules also help people who start in the same locations to often build in the same direction as one another. Variable use of the special powers, though, may alter players' build paths. Regardless of what others are doing, your own choices generally aren't very difficult. So you can play quickly, but I just don't find it very fun.

Decent, but I prefer other roll and writes over this one.

Light, simple, and fun.  I wish there was more variation from sheet to sheet.  It can be very likely that you end up with a pretty similar board to your opponent if you use the same letter sheet.

Toussaint's OctoDice has been a huge solo hit for me, and this game has that same addictive feel to it. OctoDice may have a slight advantage since it has a more variable setup (the tech tree), but gameplay-wise Castles probably seems stronger.  I'll find out after more plays.

It is too much solitaire.

Seems like it shouldn't work, but it very much does. Keeps the simplified play and shrunk components of the Card game, but still feels very much like CoB. The only drawback is that this game needed pencils with erasers on them, as the mechanics are just complicated enough that mistakes are easily made.

Still, a very pleasant surprise.

Very nice game.  If you like dice games with score pads (like quixx, quinto, yahtzee) then this game is a must have.

Being a big CoB fan, I'm not surprised I really like this one.
I find it condenses very nicely the feeling of it's big brother.

Stripped down roll-and-write blackout bingo variant activating terrain special powers.  Since there is no interaction and players can make their moves simultaneously, it could be played with large player counts as a party filler maybe on laminated sheets.  Just call out the color-number combos and write them on an easel until someone yells “burgundy bingo”.

Solo. Wish the sheets were larger, icons are hard to see. May try laminating as I couldn’t see pencil mark well either. That was the only frustrating part. Gameplay was quite fun.

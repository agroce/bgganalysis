RATING: 7
While it's an older game that may get lower ratings, Starship Tactical Combat Simulator offers some mixups to the hex an chit genre that aren't often emulated even in modern games. The inclusion of single ship tracking sheets is wonderful as you see individual systems failing with each shot. Being able to have extreme control over ships sets this game apart. I'm not a Star Trek fan but these space battles are really great.

RATING: 7
Not the most elegant system around, but the simulation is deep and complex. An excellent complement to FASA's "Star Trek: The Role-Playing Game".

RATING: 7
Having read the other reviews, I'm left a little perplexed as to what we've been doing wrong. Having played it on numerous occasions, I've always found that the games ran rather slow, certainly not the fast paced action that other reviews would seemto indicate. Having said that, I don't dislike the game, and there is still a great deal of satisfaction to be had from finally finding your way through that blasted Klingons shields. Maybe the game speeds up with repeated plays with the same players, but I have trouble persuading people to play a second time, due to the length of the first game. Nice system, now would someone like to show me the speeded up version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Results of play: simplistic
Effort to play: moderate
It neither feels like the shows, nor the novels... It plays. The off-map counter-on-sheet-based tracking was also annoying, especially since it was released in an era when photocopying was reaadily available.

This was the game we switched to after Star Fleet Battles became unplayably complex. Dated by today's standards with strange rules for shields but still fun.

I'd rather play this than Star Fleet Battles.  It's just the right level of complexity for me, plus the direct link to the sci-fi series doesn't hurt.  We had some fun add-ons, like the starship construction kit, and came up with some really good variations on play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Masses of photocopying required. Took a long time to set up. Too detailed for my liking in those days and Federation vessels were always overpowered compared to the Klingon and Romulan and Gorn enemies; massive unbalancing. Adding another enemy vessel then massively unbalanced it in favour of the enemy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Good for casual gamers, or ST completists. Very light for a serious tactical space combat game. However, the game's hex-shaped chits and map are good replacements for the (rather staid) SFB chits and maps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Had this box set for years. Lot's of wonderful spaceship, planet, asteroid etc. chits and a great big map. The control panels are a little mind numbing, and rules a bit fumbly, but I have a lot of nostalgia for the 'ol FASA games.

RATING: 8
Captures the flavour of classic trek, simple easy to learn system, and doesn't have Kzinti in it. The 'graduate' level is not as good as the intermediate level although a few rules are worth pinching. There is a good deal of subtlety in outguessing your opponents power allocation and deciding which phase to fire in a turn...too soon and you might not penetrate the shields but you might just take out the forward torpedoes...an underated classic. The problems are sides need to be very equal,even a slight advantage will unbalance things- making campaigns problematic. Also Federation ships have an advantage with generally longer ranged (and banked)phasers and shields. Banks mean 2 or 3 phasers make one dice roll to hit, take shields away from damage, apply probability theory and realise this is a huge advantage. Klingons tend to be better at knife fighting but after a while the fed player will reverse move and keep it at medium-long range. Solution match more powerful Klingon/Romulan ships against smaller Feds - the recognition manual expansions are great and avoid the points system used. Defensively a stationary cloaked ship, with the non-cloaks well back and with a high allocation to movement for counterattacks works. Hasn't aged badly at all - but I'm still waiting for a decent 3d space combat system that obeys the laws of physics.

RATING: 6
There is a tremendous amount of detail in this game, and FASA worked very hard to create a good game. Unfortunately it is limited by its necessity to be compatible with the role playing game that gave it birth. It works fine with one or two ships, but fleet actions are brain-burstingly complex.

A personal "10", but I 've recently reevaluated my rating after being "honest" with myself.

The game is lacking in a few areas and although I love the theme and the potential, the enjoyment I get from actually playing the game is mediocre.  

I grew up on FASA's version of the Star Trek universe (which, btw, was completely Paramount authorized until Paramount superceded it later- as it has done several times with other license holders now...)  I've spent a lot of time over the years updating and expanding the ships used in the system.

Could be fun, and a lot simpler IMO than Starfleet Battles aside from ship construction.

Only intended however for a small handful of ships per side(s) given the double-sided ship status sheets.

RATING: 4
Used to play this 20 years ago.  Tried the computer version the past week or so and was reminded why I have no interest in picking up the game again.  There's almost no strategy involved (or at least 'non-obvious' strategy) and the ships are far too fragile.  The pluses for the game are the very nice counters, the well put together ship recognition manuals, quick setup and playing times.  The minuses are, as mentioned above, almost no subtle strategy or chance for surprise, ships that go boom too quickly and a distinct lack of maneuver once ships are within range of each other.

Excellent space combat game that gives a good feel for the pre-Next Generation Star Trek Movies Universe.  Much easier than Star Fleet battles, and a good game to teach kids.  Fan based web pages contain Next Generation ships as well as expanded movie era hypothetical vessels.

RATING: 8
Captured more faithfully (to me at least) the look and feel of starship combat in the Star Trek universe than any other tactical level game I know of. Manoeuvring, power allocation, and careful planning combined with rules that can be ramped up slowly from the simpled to the more detailed make this a winner. Probably the game I have played second most often in my gaming career prior to 2001.

I became a ST:STCS addict in high-school, when I was starving for sci-fi strategy outlets.  To those who argue that 'Starfleet Battles' is superior, I must admit that FASA's version has its flaws, but I play a heavily home-modified version, and many a 36-hour battle has proven its worthiness...  ^_^

An often unappreciated classic from FASA that I feel really captures captain dueling in Star Trek fairly well. It very much favors doing "alpha" strikes against enemy targets. The sheets are a bit cumbersome, but still a great part of my collection and my first "real" starship game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great star ship combat game.  Fleet actions are easy and fun with this system.  I love using the Micro-Machines for Star Trek for a great miniatures game.  FASA made Task Force Game's Star Fleet Battles look like rocket science with this easy playing classic. Very fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The control panel printout is really fun and the game has a very nice Star Trek feel.  There's less strategy and more "Fire all weapons!" than I'd like but its still the best Star Trek ship vs ship game I've played.  And there's a solid online following so you can get stats for virtually every vessel in the Star Trek universe.  I'd like to see a modern version.

Good starship battle game. Only thing to make it better is the addition of miniatures to replace the counters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is more fun than it deserves to be, but is still a scream.  Take a ship from either the original Star Trek or Star Trek II-IV and go sailing around space making other players ships go away.

Heavy tactics, light strategy, horrible bias towards the Federation (Klingongs, Gorn, Romulans, and Orion pirates also available).  Some scenarios you can try out, but generally most fun when you just take a ship or a fleet and go bash one another.

Important safety tip - if you're not going to power your rear shields, don't put the Excelsior at the back of your fleet...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A somewhat inept attempt to boil down a system resembling Star Fleet Battles into something folks could play. The result was a game that was ludicrously deadly in which phasers cut through shields like butter and ships exploded all over the place. This was fine if what you wanted to see was lots of death, but for a rolegame module it was a bit of a crock as it was a surefire way to wipe out the player characters in an evening. Needed some tweaking to make it acceptable. To say it was better than Star Fleet Battles is damning with faint praise. It's an indictment of FASA design philosophy which seems to be to take a facile game system and then clamp as much chrome as possible on it. (See also Battletech and Renegade Legion: Interceptor.) It ranks a 3 rather than a 2 because the system can be rescued with a little work.

A great game where you judiciously allocate your ship's power to weapons, shields, and movement.  Some weapons are very deadly so ships can be destroyed quickly.  It's less complex than Star Fleet Battles so it plays a little faster, and since it's licensed, the game is truer to what you saw on the original Star Trek series or in the early Star Trek movies.

I loved this game when I first played it.  Over time, I found more and more shortcoming to this game.  There were some weird things that made it not feel like Star Trek like for certain ships, it wasn't worth putting up shields at all.  I've since discovered other spaceship combat games and found them vastly superior to this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A nice try on FASA's part, but there's too much luck involved.  Luck with the dice overrides any tactical maneuvering or techniques with various ships in the game.  Basic StarFleet Battles (without the tons of add-on rules) plays much better.

RATING: 7
I like this game from due to it following the movies and expanding upon them with some excellent history and ship designs.  Star Fleet battles was superior with the simple way of keeping track of damage to shields, ship, etc., but the rules generally speaking, for this one were more streamlined.  The perfect game to me would be a mixture of the 2.

A fun, relatively straightforward starship combat game developed by FASA in the mid 1980s. As a FASA Trek fan, I felt they developed an excellent universe and history from the Original series, novels, and movies through ST:III. Unfortunately, Paramount rewrote much of that fictional history with ST:TNG and threw away a lot of great work. This game could be used with the Star Trek RPG by FASA or as a standalone starship combat game.

RATING: N/A
Looking for Star Trek II SSCS or Star Trek III Starship Combat Game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It has a strong spiritual connection to its predecessor by FASA - the "Starship Duel" series of games.  Basically, it takes those games, VASTLY increases the number of ships involved, and adds movement into the equation (not just changing course and moving at a fixed 'speed' as the Starship Duel games provided for).

A comparison must naturally be made to the [i]OTHER[/i] Star Trek combat game - Star Fleet Battles.  And, in this, it falls down.  A lot of the ships feel like they were designed solely for "gee whiz" effect with little tactical consideration.  And the game's universe and backstory are also rife with...odd things.  They are both 'military' games - starship combat simulations - but while SFB was clearly designed by people who actually were IN the military, FASA's STCS was clearly NOT.

Which is not to say it's a bad game.  The use of power 'counters' to allocate power to ship systems is interesting - and certainly involves less "paperwork" than SFB's method....but it also feels 'shallower'.  How SFB handles it feels like it gives you more options, more ways to hide your intentions, more ways to try and outthink your opponent.

And, of course, there are the critical hits.  This IS a game where a single unlucky die roll WILL lose you the game, *period*.

I've always found that this Trek game plays better with a mixed smattering of the basic, and advanced, rules. There are some good ideas in the box, but not enough for it to be dragged into daylight anytime soon.
Certainly quicker to play than SF Battles, this system kept us amused for many an evening, especially using the basic control sheets; nothing better than sliding control chits along a power/shield track, rather than writing numbers down in a box.
If you love Star Trek and fancy a good time with cardboard starships, bag yourself a copy.

NB. These rules have been superceded by my own Red Alert hybrid game. I've taken the best elements of both games to create the ultimate Star Trek starship combat experience. I doubt if I'll ever play this game again - in its standard form.

A fun game much simpler than SFB. The only change my local group made back in the day was to divide the bigger torps into 5 point volleys to give smaller ships a chance. I'm up for Vassal/Skype play.

We played this CONSTANTLY in high school with custom ship designs.  I think it turned up in Target's clearance aisle for like $5, and all of us bought a copy.

Easy rules, fast game play, a little luck, some chaos, good production value, irrelevant theme, no direct conflict. This a classic euro game with all the good, the bad, and the ugly characteristics of its genre.

At least it plays fast, and hence I'm ready to play it any time again.

Most underrated game unfairly.  This game is fantatic. It should be up with the top family games like Ticket to Ride Thurs and taxis among others. The components are beautiful and the board art is from the one and only Michael Menzel. This mixed with Mr Odenhoven great game design and mechanics. It is a very simple game with strategy and depth that will keep gamers and casual player entertained  and wanting more.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this okay, but a few things confused me... the game ended very quickly so it seemed that scoring districts earlier might have been powerful... we didn't react enough to one player's move to claim nearly an entire district, and didn't react enough when the places the Baron would end up became obvious. The leaders were runaways, I was in the middle, and the loser was very far behind.

Is it really the case that after I make all my moves, I can move the bobby as far as I want in an effort to hose the next player?

RATING: 8
Thought it was a train game about mushrooms :-) Initial play with 4P skipped mid-action bobby movement, which is a huge part of tactical play. Initial plays in later turn order can feel restrictive, but there are clever outs and the 'even number of turns' rule gives an endgame edge. Lots of room to play this light or seriously, and it'll end quickly either way. Highly recommended, consider it underrated.

I grow fonder of this game with each play.  The game is one of those few games that really starts rolling early and just keeps on moving at a good clip until it ends.  The end will likely catch epxerienced gamers by surprise as it will come up right when many games are just hitting the middle mark.  While play is fast, there are plenty of options on each turn.  The game can feel a little chaotic as more players are added.  The end game is most critical and one must position themselves to take advantage of it if possible.  A very good game that lies somewhere between filler and main event game.

This is a nice gateway game that has strategies that reach much deeper than one might originally expect.  It's intriguing to me the way that you occasionally have to choose between scoring a district and placing more market stalls.  The end-game in particular is deceptively complex as you have to figure out how to maximize your points, and if you can delay the conclusion of the game in order to make that one final big move.  I have seen a few games turn at the last possible moment and swing in a new player's favor with one clever action.

This game is also delightfully short, some might even argue that it's too short.  This makes it almost a filler game.  I also find the 2-player game exciting and strategic.  On every turn (in fact in every action) you can be absolutely stumped by which action to take because you want to take them all.  This is one of the deepest and most enjoyable 45 minute games I have ever played.  But what amazes me most, I think, is that players will be scoring well over 100 points in most games, and yet every game we've played has come down to a victory by only a handful of points.  The endgame is so tense and really makes this game a winner that will never leave my collection.

I owned it, then sold it without playing it, then reacquired it.  I've played once with my six year old, but need to give it a try with my older two.  It seems like an okay family game, not one that I would actively seek to play, but not one that I'd turn down either.  I like it for it's simplicity and for the mathematics it forces my kids to use to play well.

After one playing in 2007 using a rules translation I wondered if there was a game there? It just ended quickly and wasn't engaging or challenging at all and I rated it a "3". I played again in 2008 using the rules from Playroom's version of the game and really liked it.  I don't remember any differences from playing it the first time but I now may end up getting a copy at some point.

A good short game. Once you know the rules, it usually takes around 30 mins for three players. There are always intersting choices to make, the game is beatiful, and there is a lot of player interaction. If you are looking for a good short game, try this out!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another underrated (abstractish) gem. Easy to set-up and learn, and quick to play.  For a game that can be played in 30 minutes or less,  Portobello Market offers surprising depth. Tactics and timing are key in this game, which can end quite abruptly and leave you wondering "what the heck just happened"; particularly in a 4 player game.  Portobello Market can be an aggressive game, and the district scoring action can you leave with a "take that" feeling. It scales well with any number of players, components are top notch, and replay value is high.

RATING: 5.5
Ends faster than you'd expect so you need to play once or twice in order to get the hang of it.  I feel that players have too many actions per round... which causes the game to end too quickly.  Doesn't scale well... in the 2-player game, there's very little tension over when to turn in your x2 or x4 pieces compared to the 4-player game.

Portobello Market is a very good filler I would like to try a few more times before deciding my final grade - it might go up or down by one as I think there are some flaws in the game. The biggest flaw is probably the fact that there is quite a big first player advantage; the first player is always a move ahead and probably gets to score first and get the best reserve action tokens and first dibs on most of the things. I think the other players should start with more points to make up for this. Second, the points you get when somebody moves the pawn across a street in which you have majority just doesn’t make any sense at all! They lose 1 point and you get 1 – but what’s the point of this when the final scores are something like 100-150?! It makes absolutely no sense, it should be increased tenfold or so! I thought clever placement of the building to get majority was key to victory, but it is not. What is important is to place your buildings around the middle and preferably around the same block so you can score the points x4 with your token. Of course you also need to place the grey and pink workers in a clever way to score points. These workers are drawn randomly from a bag, but the seemingly randomness is mitigated somewhat by the fact that if you draw a grey worker, which are worse than the pink, it might be a good move to place it on other players’ intersections so they score fewer points. So the luck of the draw isn’t really there.

What I did like was the extremely short playing time, the two different ways the game can end and the mechanism that you can score a district only twice during the entire game! However, this is also a small negative as it can be quite randomly and lead to very big point swings; probably too big for my taste. All in all it’s a good game, but I feel there is wasted potential when you only lose a point for crossing streets with other players’ majorities; it’s always worth doing so if you can place a house in a better spot which you almost always can.

Good, short euro to play with the kids.  Decent amount of simple math involved along with an opportunity for them to think about tactics.  Our first play (3 player) didn't go all that well since we really didn't know what we were doing - it was over before we felt we'd started - but the second play (2 player) went much better.  Better with 2?  First player advantage?  Need more plays to decide.

We have found it to be a satisfying, quick two-player game that is usually quite close and can have some impressive last-minute changes in position. I would recommend it as an addition to the collection of people mostly playing as a pair.

My friend Sam bought this at Gen Con. Afterwards we sat down and tried it out, finding it to be a really fun little area control game. I kind of wish I had purchased it at the heavily discounted price that they had at Gen Con. But I am not TOO worried about it. If I really want to get a copy of it, I can, and its not like I don't have a ton of light games to play.

Players set up markets in alleys, trying to maximise their victory points.  Very simple "placement for points" game , where players are restricted as to where they can place markets ... unless they pay points for opportunities to place elsewhere.  Lords, nobles and commoners are placed on the board to dictate just how much the markets are worth.  Game is over in about 45 minutes.  Very light to play, reminded me a lot of Web of Power in terms of game "weight".  Better than I expected, but nothing terribly new or innovative here.  Loosely themed on the Notting Hill markets (I assume) but no sign of Julia Roberts!

This is difficult type of game to pull off.   Lots of big wooden pieces and a nice board, so it looks and feels like a "big boy" game, but really it's a very light filler in disguise.   (The same could be said for Sheepland, but I liked that one, and this one not so much).   Just felt a bit bland, and missing some spark or fun-factor.

2015-03-14 : This is a Euro in its purest form. So clean it's almost an abstract. Purely tactical game where you need to "see" the opportunities as they present themselves - the kind of thing I'm really bad at, but it's still fun and it plays really fast

July 2013 - 8 ... this will probably go down, but it's still kind of fun.  Two plays (4p, 2p).  Many compare it to TtR. There are similarities but it is really its own game.

When I saw this being played, it looked immediately like a railway game, so it's not surprising to see it's origin here. So, the theme is pasted on, but it looks good and plays well. It's a nice variation on placement and scoring, with the draw from the bag to add randomness. We had a good game, but it did descend into counting possible scores to make optimum moves and that detracted a lot from the end game. Also, I just couldn't understand the end conditions. The game went on longer than I expected. But I'd really like to try this again, I'd certainly play differently. Also, we drew all 5 grey people first, so we felt it got a bit imbalanced early on. Nice game, more for gamers than families, i feel.

First of all, this game is not similar to Ticket to Ride at all! For example, there is almost no randomness (none at all with the variant) there are no hidden objectives and you are not building routes. The only similarities are due to the board layout and the fact that you place colored rectangular "things" on it. The game is good on its own and fills a rarely explored niche: quick territory games. In fact, you are doing more than building "territories", but this aspect must not be overlooked so the game becomes quite strategical. Yes, it may be spiel-des-jahres-calibrated, but it strives out of beaten paths and I like it for this exact reason.

Portobello Market has simple rules and is over fairly quickly. As some have commented, that might make it look like Spiel des Jahres family fare. However, the game has a fairly mean streak to it and if you already thought that turn order and sitting next to the worst player were important in Puerto Rico you're sure to find the same here twice over. It is extremely important not to leave great opportunities for the next player in line.

Portobello Market is just one of those games that somehow makes an immediate strong impression.  Portobello offers remarkably deep game play within a short time frame and has absolutely gorgeous components.  The game play is fast, ferocious, and brain melting yet when the game is over you don't feel expired like from other games.  Portobello actually feels lighter than it actually is, which for me is a good thing.  Comparisons to Ticket to Ride are ridiculous, as apart from colorful blocks being placed on the map these games have nothing in common.  Portobello has zero luck (if played with the variant rule, and minimal luck if played without - as you can place citizens anywhere), has opportunities for some extremely clever play (timing is key), the quick time forces players to truly maximize scoring potential every turn, and each player has to constantly be aware of potential points they are helping others achieve.  

UPDATE:  This game is a gem. I think in a lot of ways it is grossly misunderstood. One and two plays doesn't do this game justice as one is only beginning to familiarize themselves with the pace and timing of the game. Portobello is a fast game, and it's ending comes roaring at you. However, when people are used to strategy games being labouring events that consume an evening (even 90 minute games) Portobello can come across as some discombobulating paradigm that they are not willing to acclimate to. Claims of overbearing luck are misinformed or unseasoned, and frankly I prefer the random customer draw as opposed to the open information variant. I say this because although the customers are drawn randomly, the placement is nothing but strategic and can be used to totally hose an opponent. And the lord always being a constant makes the placement of customers become a vital strategic option. The strange thing is this is the only component in all of the games mechanics that presents anything random, so disregard any attempts to reduce this game to being luck driven. Knocks against theme are going to be common place with Portobello as with almost any and every Euro game. However,one can easily see the theme in this simply as competing vendors battling for prime selling spots so therefore it ties in well. Sit back, and enjoy.

A surprisingly enjoyable game that plays quick that requires the player to consider four different actions that must take into account the other players.  Good player interaction and with the prescribed variant, no luck whatsoever.  I don't know how long the game will take to wear out its welcome, but after 2 two player games I'm hungry for more.

678- It's the beginning of the 20th Century & the Londoners have $$$ to spend! As a smart merchant, you know the 3 most important rules of marketing are: location, location, &  location. That just happens to be in the area of Portobello. By carefully placing your stalls, you have a chance to attract the well-heeled customers. In some cases, it may help to bribe the Bobby! This game is suitable for a wide range of gamers. The style seems to be that of a non-cooperative puzzle.

Maybe this will improve with future plays, but right now I am pretty lukewarm about it.

What I would call a typical euro with point optimization and indirect confrontation between players. Compared to other similar games it's something middle of the road. Not too exciting, but really nothing to complain about. It's a 7 much thanks to that the game is relatively quick. I played it as a 3 player game I think it worked fine on that number of players.

Tendency: I don't expect the rating of this game to either go up or down. It's a quite solid 7.

This game is tough. You want to score points, but not allow others to score them. But most of the time they will be scoring along with you, so you want some points at least. However, where you place your market stalls and how you lure the customers to your allies really brings out interesting decisions. Plus, you think you have all the time in the world to build your stalls AND bring customers to them. Not true all the time. Sometimes you have to choose the lesser of the evils, if you're up the creek. Very interesting game that doesn't get played enough.

Hmmmmm. I like it. But I'd really like to rEEEally like it. Not there yet. Seems to end too quickly. Maybe we played it wrong? WOnder how it would play if each of the 4 players would get 20 stalls rather than 16? Would it change the game significantly? Or just extend it by a few minutes. Somehow I wanted this game to last longer than it did. It almost seemd as if the first round no one scored much. On the second several people ran up large scores. On the third, the guy in last place cruised past everyone to eke out a win based on placing his last stall on the lane with the Bobby. He, and two of the other players still had a pile of unused stalls left over. Is that normal? Would have liked another round or two of jousting on the score.

And yet, we weren't disappointed that it really was a speedy little gem!  And there's plenty of room for strategy, planning and that extra level of randomness with customer draws.  It's a nice one to have in the collection when you want a fun game, challenging strategy and interaction, and yet speed of play and set up.  Certainly a keeper!

This is a solid and well designed eurogame, but it embodies almost everything I dislike about the genre.  It is an abstract number crunching game with some extra bits thrown in like variable # of actions per round and paying VPs to move a rook which determines where the action takes place.  I can recognize its a good game and well designed, but this just isn't the type of game that I like to play.  I would rank it a 3 if I actually followed BGG's ranking system.

Könnyed egyszerű, gyors játék. Szerencsére az ára sem túl rémisztő. 

http://jemmagazin.hu/469/

A játékban mindenki egy piaci árust alakít, aki szeretne minél nagyobb haszonra szert tenni azáltal, hogy minél jobb helyekre, minél több standot állít fel. A játéktáblán utcák találhatók a standok részére és terek, amelyekre vevőket helyezhetünk. Standokat mindig csak olyan utcába szabad helyezni, amellyel éppen szomszéd kerületben van a Csendőr. A Csendőrt a körében minden játékos mozgathatja, de ez akciópontokba kerül. A játék egyszerű mechanikával rendelkezik. Minden játékosnak van 3 akciólapja. Amikor rákerül a sor, dönthet, hogy melyik akciólapot használja (2-es, 3-as vagy 4-es) és ezt képpel lefelé fordítja. Abban a körben ennyi akciót választhat. Tehát három körönként újból mindegyik akciólapot visszafordítjuk.
A lehetséges akciók a stand felhelyezés a saját készletből vagy vevő felrakása, amelyet egy zsákból húzunk ki véletlenszerűen. Háromféle vevő van: szürke – segéd, rózsaszín – polgár, fekete – lord. Amikor egy utca megtelik standokkal és mindkét végén lévő téren van vevő, akkor kiértékelésre kerül sor. Mindenki a standjai száma után pontot kap.
Ha valaki feláldozza a 2-es vagy 4-es akciólapkát, akkor elérheti, hogy egy kerületben lepontozzák a standjait, de csak az övét, ilyenkor a többiekét nem. A játéktáblára felrakott akciólap helyett kap egy másikat, de ezen már kevesebb akciópont van, azaz jól kell taktikázni, hogy mikor áldozzuk fel az akciólapjainkat. 
A játékosok megpróbálnak a másik előtt egy lépéssel járni és olyan helyeken értékelni, ahol nekik jó, de a többi játékosnak nem. Persze a többi játékos is erre törekszik, így sokszor oda-vissza lépések történnek. A játék könnyed, gyors lefolyású. A dobozán 35 percnyi játékidőt tüntettek fel, de ketten akár 20 perc alatt is lejátszható. Miután a gondolkodást és a szerencsét megfelelően vegyíti, a szabályai pedig egyszerűek, ezért gyerekek is nyugodtan játszhatnak vele, vagyis igazi családi játék.

Good game.  Easy to learn and quick playing.  A cross between a Euro and an abstract, in my opinion.  The game is a Euro strategically, but the rules are so simple that it feels like an abstract at times.  Can bog down toward the end as people run through all the math for their last couple of plays. It's a slight brain burner.  Fun to play and overall a very good game.  (I think the wooden stalls are ugly, but the game quality is good overall.)

A slightly engaging, themeless abstract with some problems. As scoring usually earns points for more than one player there's a quite serious kingmaker issue when more than 2 are playing. There don't seem to be enough 'stall' pieces in the game as several streets are still empty at the end, and why did the publisher have to be so mean as to include fewer pieces for some colours? Is wood so expensive? I just love that Bobby piece though! It's a classic!

Very straightforward game in which you are spending actions to place market stalls and "customers", it's all about getting your stalls into the right places so that the customers can score you the most points.

Not very deep nor is it particularly exciting to look at, but it plays very quickly and there's enough strategy to make me want to play it several more times before moving on.

Received this game free from Tygo..thanks!  Rule reading made it a bit fuzzy at first, didn't seem as intuitive as others, and reading the rules forum here added to some confusion...so I just played it and then it all made sense.  Not a hard game at all, quick, leaders can change quite a bit.  My 8 and 12 year old got it and played competitively. Nice board and bits, a solid game indeed. Can cause a little AP, many things you want to do in your turn, but those pesky limits are there making the choices hard. Non gaming hubby liked it. 10/08

RATING: 7.5
Rated after a two-player and a three-player game.

The board looks great, but this quickly disappears and a highly abstract game appears once the game starts.  The varying market values (higher-lower vs. lower-higher) make positioning choices interesting, and when you use your district scoring is critical.  Quick-playing.  Interestingly when I played three-player the game almost went too quickly.

You see the 30 minute play time listed (our 1st game actually took 40 minutes) and think it's a quick filler... but some AP can take place near the last third of the game and there are some interesting choices.  I think next time I'd like to play with open info variant regarding the order of the customers (like in Marracash).

RATING: 6
Rating after two 4p games.
There are a couple of things I don't like much in this game:
1) the last few turns can be extremely slow as every player tries to get the best out of his actions while trying to predict what the other players will do.
2) your score can be heavily influenced by other players choices.
Maybe these two problems are caused by inexperience and I will surely play it more, but I don't think my rating will ever go higher than a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial rating. Enjoyable, quick game. Simple rules, plenty of strategy, very thin theme. The game Ticket To Ride should have been. :) Be aware, that with the advanced variant (where customers are pre-drawn) the game is essentially a no-luck abstract game, and as such can get pretty cutthroat. The two-player game feels particularly so (since multiplayer-induced chaos is removed), and I don't much care for that.

As I enjoy light Euros and this was supposed to be something like a quick version of Ticket to Ride, I was expecting quite a bit. But the game didn't live up to the expectations yet. Is that really all? Too abstract as well and potentially biased against players early in the turn order. There's hope that it will pick up with experienced players as more players will see the value of picking customers themselves and not just fill up the board with their market booths as quick as possible.

RATING: 6
I can see where the complaints of a rapid ending come from.  It's nice that the game is so quick, but at the same time the end always came too soon.  Maybe this is because we would always just lay down as many trains/stands as possible on our turns and pull out the customers at the end.  I don't know - maybe that's the wrong way to play the game.  But when everyone else is laying down pieces every turn, it's hard to take a turn off to place a customer.  I'd like to play this more, as the game still feels a little weird to me.  Ridiculous retheming - sure, there's tons of train games around, but this theme makes absolutely no sense.

Traded away.

A very weak and typical Euro game. Nothing special here, I'm sure we've all played this game in one form or another. Players have 3 actions chits (flipped over when used, and returned when all chits are flipped). Each action chit allows players to place 2, 3 or 4 markets on the board or place scoring markers on the board. Ho-hum. 

I personally thought the game was broken. It ended too quickly, there was no room for much strategy and left me feeling quite dissatisfied (as though I hadn't played a REAL game).

You put down investments with some simple spatial constraints. With more than two players shared interests are inevitable and kingmaking is manifest in mutual gain ("I'll boost this row for Bob and me") as well as mutual loss ("I'll stop Bob from scoring big at my own expense"). It is surprisingly quick: before half of the board is filled in you need to think about the end of the game and what you need to do before then.

Fun, easy to play, moves quickly. A pleasure.

No 'theme' at all, very abstract, except that it has 'atmosphere'. Always makes me think of [GameID=4636] somehow. I think this is because the focus of the game moves around the board in the same way as it does in [GameID=4636].

HOWEVER, we made a mistake in reading the (poor) rules. Turns out that you can't start market stalls on either entrance of a street - you can only continue from the same side already started. Thematically it makes sense to be able to start from either side, and it makes for a much better and much faster game as well. And after playing some the 'proper' (poorly misworded) way, we will stick with our own interpretation (of yet another poorly laid out set of rules).

Definitely does *not* feel like a train game.

I like this game is a bit random and is hard to see how it is possible to have strategy by it is possible. It is not a random game. My favourite think in the game is that there a not bad moves and although they are good and beater and in fact the best moves. The second think is that all payers create commune situation on the board and they have to react to it and it is always changing situation. In general I like games in which payers create commune game situation and there is a lot if interaction, I guesses that this liking is form chess. In a way it is similar to Ticket to Ride

A lot of game crammed into half an hour playing time, and apparently there are several possible winning strategies available. It's a tight little package, nevertheless quite easily accessible, and the only thing that might keep it from standing beside my current favorite light game, Yspahan, is that the small influence of the only random mechanic (scoring) might decrease replayability. I'm quite willing to find that out, however!

Score victory points by filling lanes and bracketing them with meeples, or use a special ability to score a whole area.  The color of the meeples determines the score multiplier, and provides the only random element in the game.

Enjoyable at first, but I'm not sure there is enough here to keep it from getting stale with repeated play.

This has the makings of a good game, but not in its current form. The scoring mechanism is combined with how fast the game plays, normally a good thing, but here it can ruin the game. There just doesn't seem to be enough time to work out a strategy. I have some ideas on how to make the game a little more stable, but I'm not sure if it would make it better. The player that gets to place the final piece (the black pawn) seems to have too big of an advantage over everyone. There are too many other good games to waste my time trying to make this one good.

The mechanics feel solid but not very original. Game is quite fast to play but when played with 4 players it feels to end too soon. There are relatively few turns/actions per player. Might be better with 3 or even just 2 players but 4 is a bit too much for the game if you want to play seriously. Might be better as a lighter game for non-gaming crowd.

RATING: 7
Portobello Market is an abstract route-building game, with "market stalls" (trains?) placed on route spaces and "customers" (stations?) placed on juctions. Players share routes and score jointly when they are completed and customers are in place. There are incentives to work together with, or in opposition to the other players on different parts of the board. Portobello Market really wants to be a train game.

But the chosen theme works quite well, largely due to the board, which is beautifully illustrated by Michael Menzel.

Portobello Market takes about 30 minutes to play, and seems best with four players (it is still quite good with two or three). It is easy to teach, and there is depth to the strategy. It is not simply enough to to maximise your own score - players must also know when to inhibit their opponents and when to cooperate and share. Timing, especially at the end of the game, can be critical.

規則:
*起始根據人數使用不同的攤位數
2: 30 紅黃
3: 20 紅黃綠
4: 16 全部
*每個玩家拿對應幫助卡跟起始三個行動圓片，中立行動圓片按數字疊起，3在最上面，分數標記放在10
*除了黑色以外顧客丟進袋中
*起始玩家選擇警察放哪並開始遊戲，當有玩家放下最後一個攤位，且全部都進行一樣回合數時，遊戲結束
*每輪有兩種選擇
1.從開著的行動板塊擇一翻面並作該行動數(全翻下回合再翻回來選)，行動二選一
A 放攤位在警察所在區域邊邊，空的可選兩邊開始放，不然就要繼續連著放
B 袋中抽顧客放在街區的邊緣
2.選擇開的2or4行動板塊放在街區中，統計環繞街道上的該玩家顏色攤位數*行動數獲得分數，然後抽一個中立行動板塊取代自己放出去的
* 隨時可移動警察，如果跨過的街區自己是多數沒事，空的扣一分，別人是多數要付別人一分
*當街道兩邊有顧客且擺滿攤位時計分，分數為街道上數字總和*顧客連線分數
*顧客全抽完會自動把最後一個黑色放在最後一個位置，遊戲結束如果黑色那條有街道沒完成，依舊計分
*變體，遊戲開始前先一個一個抽顧客照順序擺，所以所有玩家會知道顧客順序，黑色依然最後

Based on one play: A quick and light game, in the same category as Ticket to Ride, but even shorter. You do not have many options on your turn, but within each option you want to optimize your points. Lay down markets for later scoring and to gain points when the active area token is moved or use your action token to score some quick points. As it is quite short, do not wait too long as not all areas will score.

I had decided not to buy this because I had read comments about the similarity to Ticket To Ride. 

Picked up the game on clearance for $15 CAD, and discovered that there is no resemblance to TTR at all. 

Only problem is my copy was missing 1/2 of the blue & green stalls. Haven't heard back from Schmidt yet.

I enjoyed the designer's more obscure Die Dolmengotter and there are some clear family resemblances, but I found this a little less interesting. Both are quick and subtle Euro-abstracts, and I might have liked PM more if I hadn't played it right at the end of a long gaming weekend.

Purchased with a gift card for my fiftieth birthday, I had to go with what Barnes and Noble had available. Not a bad little game at all, but neither is it terribly innovative or captivating.

From a glimpse of the board, one can tell that Portobello Market's prototype used to be a traingame. It looks exactly like the Ticket to Ride board. That being said, I never played Ticket to Ride and as such, Portobello Road has a lot to offer to me. A solid Euro and light brain teaser, with only very limited luck. The theme is lovely and so are the pieces. The two player game is more of a brain teaser, more focused and tight while playing with more players, especially four becomes more frantic and chaotic, in a good way. Still, the game is missing the big WOW factor and while being a solid and entertaining game, it will probably not see much play to many better games being around.

RATING: 5
NOTHING about this game is remotely better than any other game out there.
a) It is overproduced, which should increase the cost beyond what it should be (wood stalls? why?)
b) The theme is so absurdly non-present, I looked in the rules and couldn't find where or when it was supposed to take place. I find it listed here on BGG (1901, apparently) but I don't know ehere that info came from.
c) It doesn't seem remotely balanced. I happened to go 1st in a 4-player game, and my first turn ended up winning me the game by a mile (after alley and precinct scoring). (Redacted after finding out it was a rules oversight)
d) The age recommendation is patently incorrect - 8 year olds are simply not ready for the strategic combinations, and that's all this game has.

And wow - [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/28499/comment/741134#comment741134]look over here[/url] - Portobello Market is THE worst game on BGG for people lowering their ratings. That really is interesting - it may show how thin the theme is and how easily-exposed its mechanics are.

--May2007-- I can't say I really knew what I was doing, at least until after the game was over.  An ending, I might add, that came even more subjectively-abruptly than that of Through the Desert.  But there's still an interesting game there.  I'd be happy to play again, though I don't know I'd seek it out.
--Sep2011-- For my second play, I was much more careful with paying attention to the onset of the end game.  As it happened, there were only 7 turns, so each one matters.  I need to remember to pay more attention to the number of remaining customers next time.

Bought on the strength of all the comments here which highlighted the speed of play, accessibility to new gamers, depth and variety of playing strategies.

What a great find.

Cracked it open when my brother and his other half were visiting (not exactly boardgamers, although I have previously subjected them to Talisman and Settlers at successive xmases). Game went phenomenally well, they loved it, my brother occassionally murmuring in stunned surprise "This really is a good game."

Serious contender for my first '10' rating, although with my butterfly taste in gaming experiences, I am not sure that that is ever achievable by BGG criteria.

Edit : the novelty has worn off a bit as a 2 player, for which I would usually prefer to go for Hansa or Cartagena. Still think it's a first rate game for it's niche, which would be 3-4 players, fast play, accesible depth.

RATING: 7.5
A delightful surprise! Easy to learn, short game time, but a significant amount of weight! A great gateway game!

[b]Edit:[/b] I'm starting to become very suspicious of this game. Frequently the winner is the player who is seated in the last position for turn order. Why? He has the distinct advantage of being able to force the end game condition without anyone having the chance to respond. If any other player triggered the end game condition, all players after him in turn order have a chance to respond and possibly supersede his point value. However, the player in last position has always the option to quickly dart ahead to score just a point higher than the leader, trigger the end game condition while doing so, and abruptly win. No other player has this ability. In the end, the game is unbalanced. Perhaps if I rotate the turn order every round? Not sure. I will playtest it but I shouldn't have to fix a published game's mistake. Lowered the score a half a point.

This is a perfect example of the pasted-on-theme-style Eurogame. It has mechanics: choose 2, 3 or 4 Action Points to either place markets in alleys or meeples (which trigger off scoring multipliers depending on what meeples are placed at the ends of alleys).

The game is mercifully short but players don't make any real meaningful choices. It's quite processional and there is little hard choices (aside of timing the use of the 2 and 4x scoring pieces). It's overpriced and would have worked better as a small box filler. Great looking pieces and artwork though.

Although I quite like this one, sadly no one else I've played this with shares my feelings. Thus this one will be heading out the door.

Plays a bit like Ticket to Ride, but a lot quicker and without the need for card collecting.

Action Point, Connection. Rating after 4p x2. Surprisingly tough for such a short game. Not sure I've grasped all the strategy yet, but hard to argue with this much play in only 30-40 minutes per game.

Traded after it went unplayed for a couple years.

The game is short and that is a plus. The map looks gorgeous and the mechanics are fairly good as well. However the whole affair is too mathy and abstract for me, plus it almost always ends quite suddenly and unexpecedly.

RATING: 7
This walks the fine line between an abstract game and a Euro.  I think that there is a bit of a first player advantage, but what can you do, it probably won't win the game.  I do like the constraints of the game as you are constantly faced with controlling scoring vs manipulating board position and thoroughfares.  It plays quick and easy and works well with multiple players (which I find is sometimes difficult with abstracts).  The pasted on theme does do a good enough job for you to pretend you are actually doing something "substantial" which is something I usually require when dealing with abstracts.

RATING: 6
It's an interesting idea. The board shows a town divided into districts, with each district having 2 streets with spaces for market stands. Stands are worth 1, 2 or 3. There's a police token that functions like El Grande's king in reverse -- you can only place your tokens (markets) in the distirct with the Police marker. You may move the Police at any time on your turn, paying VP to the player who controls the street you're crossing. Players have 3 chits - 2, 3, 4. On your turn, you choose which of these to use, and flip it over: it indicates how many actions you get (after all 3 used, they become available to choose again). Actions include playing markets (fill in from one end of the street towards the other) and drawing People tokens. People are grey or pink, and are placed at intersections. Whenever both ends of a street have a Person AND all stands on the street are filled, the street scores: Stand pts are multiplied by 1, 2, or 3 depending on which people are on the ends (gray-gray, gray-pink, or pink-pink). The game ends at the end of the round when a player uses their last market; that player gets to place a black Person, which will score streets with a 4 or 5 multiplier, even if all markets on the street are not filled. One last rule: you can use the 2 and the 4 once each as 2x and 4x multipliers for the NUMBER of your markets in the district; these are left on the board (only 1 playable for each region) and replaced by a 3 action marker. The player with the most VP wins.

It's a neat idea, but seemed to end before it really got going. Probably poor play on my part (I lost by a large margin) but no one really enjoyed the game very much. There seemed to be the problem that when one person could end the game, SOMEONE needed to waste their turn to block them. Perhaps worth another try, but not necessarily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just not that fun.  Spend action points, lay down your markers, repeat, etc.  Near the end, which comes too fast, spend time calculating your optimal points.  I think the seeds of a good game are present.  It just needs one or two additional elements to make the game more compelling.

Great simple game. The game's core is  route making but unlike so many other games of this type player interaction is the key to victory. MrsSorp gives this the thumbs up. 
Update! Played it 3 players yesterday and i think it's much much better as a 2 player, 3 players felt a bit too random. 2 players you can apply a little strategy to the game. Down rated from 8 to 7. Definitely 2 player, in fact good 2 player game. There are a few paths to victory - exhaust market stalls, control customer placement, area domination, or play tactic/reactive using your area score tiles to restrict your opponent and get a extra action.  Rating high as a Mrs Sorp fave.

I've only played a two player game of this so far. Great components, and looks very nice, especially as the alleys fill with stalls and customers as the game progresses.  Its speedy (which I like), but with two players its over too quickly and lacks any real tension. I can see this being much better with 4 as the bobby is bounced over the board by each player.  Its been compared to Ticket to Ride, but is quite different. The theme of market stalls actually makes more sense here than a train theme would have.

An elegant, simple design that presents a ton of difficult choices for players each turn. The end game, however, can spark way too much analysis as players calculate potential scoring moves and decide whether it is to their advantage to play their last market stalls and wrap things up. Still, this streamlined game plays pretty quickly overall and I didn't see that as a fatal flaw ... but enough to knock Portobello Market down a bit in my ratings. I've also seen some complaints about kingmaking, but I suppose the same claim could be made of any game where defensive moves are possible, and Portobello Market definitely allows for some key defensive moves, mainly in the placement of the lower-value customers. It's a shame this one has such end-game problems because there's a lot to like here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Situated firmly in the category of abstract games, Portobello Market is made brilliant by snappy gameplay and a refreshing theme that avoids the obvious but exhausted train genre.  The simple story of street vendors, beautifully illustrated by Michael Menzel, makes this easy to teach.  Portobello Market isn't that much harder to learn and play than checkers, but it is eons more fun.

A game of trying to win majority scores on routes, made a little more complex by placement constraints + restrictions, and the per-endpoint-type route multipliers.

Placing customers for the end-point multipliers is critically powerful, but doing all of it and not getting to place stalls of your own provides a nice balancing penalty.

The game is very simple to play and the speed of the game leaves you grasping for any way to get enough actions to score your stalls.

Part of the Playroom gateway series, along with Ilium and Livingstone.  Scratched the first two-player game when we realized that we were going to run out of markets a lot sooner than we realized.  We hadn't put out many citizens/aristocrats, and so the scores were really low.  Fortunately, my partner was okay with starting again, and we were able to play where things were a little tighter.

RATING: 7
I didn't know anything about the gameplay of this game going in. What I did know about it was that it had been clearance bin fodder for a good long while bottoming out at about $5. As such, I was a little hesitant to try it. As it turns out, I rather enjoyed it.

In the game there's various streets connected via intersections. In the game you have three action tokens, a 2 action token, 3 action token and 4 action token. On your turn you flip one and take that many actions. You only unflip these once all three have been used.

The general idea of the game is that you're placing your market stalls along streets and customers in intersections. When placing markets in a street without markets, you must start at one end or the other of a street. All subsequent markets on that street must continue in the direction. This is important because market stall spots are numbered from 1 to 3, so some spots are more valuable than others.

Additionally, streets are only scored when a street is completely filled with market stalls and there are customers at both ends of the street. The customers on the street determine a multiplier for the values of the market stalls. There are three types of customers, gray (5), pink (5) and black (1). The black customer must be the last customer placed (and might not come out). Gray are the worst customers and black is the best. So Gray-Gray is worse than Gray-Pink which is worse than Pink-Pink, etc. Multipliers range from x1 to x4.

There's a "bobby" (policeman) in the game that occupies "districts" (areas surrounded by 3 streets). When placing markets, you must place them in one of the streets where the bobby is. However, you can move the bobby at any time during your turn. If you move the bobby across an empty street, you lose one point. If you move the bobby across a street where someone else has the majority of markets, you pay them one point. If two people are tied for the majority, you must pay them both. If you move the bobby across a street where you have the majority of markets, then you lose nothing.

Instead of taking actions, you can give away either your 2 action token or 4 action token. You don't take any actions, but you place the token in a district and score point equal to the quantity of markets you have bordering that district x2 or x4 (depending on which token you used). Then you draw a replacement action token. There's a stack which starts out as 3's and then drops to 2's and 1's by the end.

There are more streets than it's possible to complete, so you don't want to start a street that won't complete. But if someone else puts low level customers at the ends of a street you've started, no one else will want to join you on that street. Meaning either you abandon it, or finish it yourself. If any player ever uses all their wooden bits the game ends (everyone has the same number of turns), which can mean the black customer doesn't come out. If the black customer does come out, then his streets score at the game end, even if they aren't completely filled with market stalls.

There's a lot to think about in this game. It's a very tactical game where things can change quickly.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=27356][/thing] has a [thing=9209][/thing] feel to it. It is a more complex game, however, since the scoring has more layers, as it changes accordingly to the customers put, and also requires more timming to use the individual markers to gain points.

Basically, everyone in the game wants to put their stands in the market and, also, put (the best) two customers at the end of the streets in which your stands are. Stands can only be put in streets adjacent to the Bobby, and this one can be moved by paying points (if you have the most stands in a street the Bobby is crossing, you pay nothing, if there isn't stands in the street, you simply pay 1 point, if someone else has the majority of stands in the street, you pay 1 point and the other player gains 1). Move the Bobby is a free play.

In his turn the player uses one of his markers - they are numbered 2, 3 and 4. The number is how many actions he will have in that turn, and once used is turned down, and will only the available again when all the markers are used. There is only two main actions to be done: put stands or customers. Stands must be put from left to right, or right to left (the first stand put in a street decides this). Customers can be put anywhere in the board, but only one per square. The third possible action is use the marker to score an area: the player choose the x4 or x2 and put it in the center of an area, scoring the number of stands he has in the adjacent streets times the number on the marker used. The marker is then substituted with a neutral one.

When all the spaces for stands are filled and there are customers in both ends of it, the stands will score. The players gain points equal to the value of the stand (written in the board - it goes from 1 to 3) multiplied by the set of customers (two citizes is x1, a citizen and an aristocrat is x2, two aristocrats is x3).

The game ends in the round the Baron enters in play (it is the last customer available) or when a players puts all his stands on the board. The round still continues until everyone have the same amount of turns. Streets connected with the Baron will still score, but others that haven't been already, and aren't connected to it, won't. The player with the most points wins!

[thing=27356][/thing] showed itself as a good game - both easy to learn and to teach. Turns are mostly fast and a plays usually last under 40 minutes - it is this fast. Still, with all of this, [thing=27356][/thing] has some depth, allowing for more control in the game than the one present in [thing=9209][/thing], for instance, as the amount of actions (which marker) is decided by the player, and the movement of the Bobby also - the only random element in the game is the customer, but even those can be organized in a order, at the start of the game, so it will be clear which one will come, instead of pulling them from a bag.

Also, the screwage factor is a little higher, as is more direct (as is obvious) than that from [thing=9209][/thing]. If you fill a street, but doesn't put customers there, chances are you will end up with two grays (citizens) in both ends. [thing=27356][/thing] calls for a little cooperation, as your chances get better of having better customers if someone else also have stands in the same street.

The bits are nice, but I usually like fillers (and [thing=27356][/thing] is one, for sure) to be small, as it is easy to carry together with the "meat" of a game night. Only a small caveat, I know (important for those that go to the game nights with a backpack with games, like me).

[thing=27356][/thing] was a big surprise for me, beign much quicker than I thought (when the end game was triggered I was almost taken aback), while also allowing room for strategy and smart plays. It is a filler, as I said, but sure is heavier than most of the ones in this spot.

I'm not sure what to think about this game, really.  It moves quickly, which is a good thing, and it has some interesting things going on with how you place your pieces and when you choose to place a customer, but a lot of the game revolves around the "Don't leave the game in such a state as to make it too good for the next player in the game" principle, which makes me feel like I'm giving too much of the game to the person following me.  I'd play it again, but I'm not sure if I'm going to clamor to play it over other, more similar games.

One thing that it's important to note, though: This is NOT a friendly little game.  Just because it says "Playroom Entertainment" on the box, don't expect it to be a game where everyone does their own thing and doesn't interfere with other players' moves.

A solid 7 Euro that fits into a perfect time niche of 30-45.  Good enough to be a filler but can also be a main dish if you want to play it a few times.  Nice choices to be made without causing AP or overstaying its welcome.

Looks nice and pieces are nice. Theme is ok too.  Quick to play, easy to learn how to play.  A game I would happily play again but would not suggest it myself.  I have rated it a 7 rather than a 6 because I think I would like it more with 3 or 4 players.

OK game.  Kind of bland.  Good mechanics/scoring, but not very "fun."  Typical Euro . . . theme painted on.

This game plays super fast which is awesome as it still has interesting strategy in it. You try to control certain streets with your markets in order to maximize your point values. 

The game only comes with enough pieces for 2 players in 2 colors though, so if you want to play as one of the other two colors in a 2 player game you're out of luck. The same thing applies for 3 players.

Played once (with 4 players). A short and very light game. The ideas may not be very original, but they work quite well together - however, I have not found anything exciting in that game. The components and illustrations are nice, though.

Fast and reasonably fun little game.  It offers some fairly interesting choices.  The bobby movement penalty is interesting.

Has some interesting mechanics, but the game is over very quickly. I only use it as a quick filler if we've only got 30 mins to spare, and then only if there is nothing else to play!

There are several different parts of the game to be managed in order to optimize your play.  Only being able to use 2, 3, or 4 actions once until all action numbers have been taken give a balance to how you want to approach building.  In addition, using these actions as part of the scoring mechanism (District Scoring) makes you think about how a scoring may change your ability to take actions in the future.  And finally, you cannot ignore the customers.  My wife did, and I controlled their placement, for the most part being able to place the Lord in a very advantageous position for me.

Update: I have upped my rating from a 7 to an 8 after another play.  This really is a fast playing, deep strategy game.  I hope I can get my wife to play this more often.

This game scales well with more players although the more players the less forgiving as you will have fewer chances to 'fix' a bad play.

7 after 1 play.

Simple and easy to teach. Theme is rather pasted on and it is an abstract game at heart. Components are good quality.

Lacking any real means of strategy, the gameplay in Portobello Market is fairly generic and the decisions are often painfully obvious.  There is actually very little one can do to affect the other players, with the exception of taking away a valuable district scoring from the leader.  Although the experience is made inoffensive by the relatively short duration, I am pretty sure there are plethora of better games to spend your 30 minutes in.

RATING: 7
Portobello Market is certainly a fast game.  Some interesting tactical stuff going on, pretty abstract.  Not a ton of depth to it, but enough to make it enjoyable for its length.  Room for clever plays.  I like it so far.

First thing that has to be said, is the fact, that we both love the artwork and the theme. Especially the theme is different. You’re building a market in the streets of London. Then the game. It’s set-up in about 5 minutes. Read the rules and explained the game in another 10 minutes (I know, I should read the rules before we start a game. But, we decided what to play, when we’re in front of our game cabinets, so that might be difficult.) Each player has 3 tokens in front of him, with the numbers 2, 3 & 4. He decides which token he wants to use, and the number on the token shows how many actions the player can do in that turn. He can choose between two different kind of actions. One is place a market stall on a street, or two call a customer and place him on a square. He only can place a stall in the area where the Bobby is situated. When he wants to move the Bobby, that isn’t considered an action, but he might have to pay to move it. But, there is no money in the game. The player has to pay with points. After one player has placed all of his market stalls, the round will be finished and the game ends. The player with the most points win.

That’s all there is into this one. Not difficult to play. Not a lot of tactics involved. Luck is involved by calling the customers. But that’s not a drama. Not a bad game nor a great game. Just a nice family-game for every now and then, when you’re in the mood for a no-brainer.

It seemed like a nice little filler (maybe comparable to Taluva), and was cheap, so I ran for it.

Costed 2990 HUF (was heavily discounted at FLGS).

Update: this one is getting better and better. Once you get comfortable with the rules and the basic gameplay you can fully focus on the strategy! Maybe one of the best deep and fast games.

Looks easy but definitely is more an abstract brain burner (if played so) than a light family game... Great components, easy rules and a fast playing time.
I enjoyed my first game even though I made lots of bad moves. I have to play it again to give it a proper rating. From my first impression I would say it's a 7 (mainly because normally abstract games don't attract me that much).

Debes ir gastando fichas que indican cuantas acciones tienes cada ronda. Puedes colocar mercados, colocar clientes o mover al plicía (determina dónde puedes construir). Puntúa cuando una cuadra tenga todos sus puestos y clientes en ambos lados.

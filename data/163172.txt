RATING: 8
Tried Hougoumont, the introductory scenario, within a few minutes of the game arriving. It is one notch above Napoleon's Last Battles in complexity, otherwise very similar. Correct facing and formation is left to junior officers whilst the player operates each 20-unit corps/division in turn. Sixteen event cards moderate luck etc, being exchanged  between players rather than discarded after use. Skirmishing is done with light units attacking more effectively and cavalry gets into combat more easily, but otherwise they are similar in combat to infantry & artillery, which back up each other. Thus combat is simplified to the most sensible degree.
Map and units are very nicely presented half-inch size, with German-family-game quality die-cutting. A downside is the usual C-grade English translation - why they can't get someone to proof-read I can't figure. Numerous play-aids round out the high-quality package.

Very much enjoying it so far. Some of the rules have you thinking that isn't right but when you play it out, it works very well. See firing as an example.

RATING: 5.5
You can give it 10 for production, the map, the historicity, whatever you like but as a game, according to my tastes, it doesn't work very well.

It takes way too long to play, at least a full day for sure.

Wristage is significant.

I can't see any innovative mechanisms. Morale checks on 2d6 have been around forever, roll-to-activate formation whether through chit-pull or otherwise is nothing new.

It may feel right but gamewise, linear tactics battles where the decisions leading to the clash are already made, is boring at best, especially if you don't have any specific passion for Napoleonic era like me. So no, I don't think I will ever play this again.

But I understand that some folks may rate this as a 10. Personal tastes, really.

Terrific and engrossing game.  Gorgeous and good quality components,  rules have a few quirks, some things to remember, but in the end straightforward and manageable for its size.

RATING: 9.6
Game looks great ... terrific production values.  The cards that come with the game all punched themselves in transit (not a complaint because it shows how neatly and thoroughly the cards were stamped out).

"Magnified" map comes in two pieces and doesn't fit standard 22 x 34 size ... might need new plexi to cover on table.  Counters are attractive and readable.

Rules are very tight, and the game play is really good (it's on the light-medium scale of difficulty).  I've got a playing on the table right now, and will be playing a FTF game shortly ... so will have a very good grasp of this game fairly soon.

Not normally that keen on tactical games, I find this one exactly right for me. Just enough historical detail, just enough of "game", just enough complexity. Easily on my top five list of wargames, and visually even higher than that.

Moderate complexity, mechanisms looks interesting.

Very well done regimental-level system, with sufficient tactical representation while avoiding the morass of the lovely, but plodding, Clash of Arms version of the La Bataille series.  Looking forward to the release of Rising Eagles, which translates this system to Austerlitz.

This game is simply excellent and very thin. 

Excellent simulation, that does not care about the smallest detail but gives the player an excellent simulation of what the generals could do.

a hell of fun playing this game but, ehm... imo it isn't too much "napoleonic" (particularly in the tactical treatment of cavalry and overall about the losses issue). 
Fallen eagles is a game "about Waterloo" in which the Emperor can try to play Kolin instead of the actual battle (my buddies actually tried it), play out the historical battle or whatever. 
I'm working on a couple of house rules to address and assess differently the cavalry issue.

Accessible rules and a cleverly designed and relatively quick playing game. 

The component quality is superb (way better than anything I've seen from any of the US wargame publishers). You'll wish every wargame you own looked this good.

Highly recommended for anyone wanting to play Waterloo at the grand tactical scale.

Awesome production value.  Every component is perfect, typical of Hexasim. Napoleon's campaign in Waterloo in one game at a Corps-Division scale. A refreshing game from the French perspective. I played the game in 2015 December, just in time for its Bicentennial celebration.

Excellent game overall.  The only one point knocked off was that I was not entirely convinced by the Corps command system off-map.  The orders, geographic or defense, are hidden first from the opponent and revealed when the corps move closer to the enemy.  Before that, however, whether the movement complies with the order is purely an honor system since a certain number of orders can be changed once a turn according to a dieroll.  The alternative way is to put them onto the corp leader counter or a house rule to require reveal of the orders at the end of the game turn. The Overall Commander of the Army seems play no greater role than any other leaders in the game.  So Napoleon and Wellington don't have much effect on the play, which is not quite expected of them in many literary works.  But well, Napoleon didn't commit his own Imperial Guard only very late in the day.  Otherwise, the command activation system by the leadership initiative factor feels very Napoleonic!  

The rules are very organized and concise. Nonetheless, I forgot to choose the Tactical Cards in the first place but that is something that can make-do. I wonder if it is due to the order of the rules which make us missing the part. Some very important special rules are written in the Playbook instead of the Rulebook, e.g. restriction on Napoleon and Guard activation, French movement to the east of hex row xx33, etc.  Be sure to check in the Playbook as well when you are playing the full campaign. At some other places, they can be tightened a bit more to avoid casting doubt, e.g. the artillery fire worst DRM should apply, and hence no -1 for adjacency, even if the other artillery fires from one to two hexes away from the target, not literally just for three or four hexes away as on the player aid.  Another example is the movement rule on the eZOC - while it is allowable to move from eZOC directly to another eZOC with all MPs, it is not allowed for a unit to exit one first and then "re-enter" into another.  The rules are there but conceptually they can be intertwined to cause confusion because a direct move into another eZOC can be seen, at least to me, as "re-enter" as well.  A one point knock-off from my rating of the game as a result. Perhaps I should adjust myself from reading the rules too literally in the case of French writing.   

Replayability is extremely high. The initiative determination and formation activations make sure no two game will be the same, despite the general attrition between the lines on both sides. There are shorter scenarios to play for those who can't find the time to complete the "long" campaign game (well, it might be short, who knows about the dieroll result during the End of Turn phase?)  Nonetheless, Fallen Eagles is extremely PBeM-friendly and I suggest you to play the campaign game with Vassal.  Glorious-looking, Fallen Eagles is sure to become a classic for Napoleonic operational-tactical level wargame of practical sagacity.  As each formation moves in dandified uniforms with art illustrated on the counters, there is an indefinable air of resolution of alertness, very much alive like you are watching a movie or reenactment on-site. I am thrilled by what operational options the game can offer to the players in a tactical situation and I can't speak highly enough of it. Fallen Eagle is a complete package.  I bought every Hexasim wargame along the way and they never disappoint! Plus, the game contains odour of fragrance of quality materials! Overall, an exquisitely created game.

Nice game. Good use of some classical wargame concepts.

A LOT of die rolls. 

The Cavalry rules could be better.

The dark hex numbers occult an otherwise beautiful map. Come on guys, look at how Clash of Arms do their maps and emulate! :-)

Great game, gorgeous component, activation system smooth and well thinked, great replayability, and good balance between the two armies. 
It's not easy, neither for Wellington and Blücher, neither for Napoléon to handle the battle. 
You have to adapt to events and circumstances in constant evolution, the simulation works well in the global scope, even if some détails may seem odd.

Best deluxe tactical napoleonic box game on the market. Leadership, moral, fog of war, orders, everything is there. Top quality components. Beautiful die-cut counters, superbe large hexes map (but the number on each hexes should have been printed lighter). Many ''What if'' possibility thank to a small deck of playing cards. Unfortunately, lot of die rolls. A Napoleonic masterpiece.

  Vive L'Empereur !

Great components and an interesting system.

Tried the first scenarios and they seem better for solo play.
I also tried Plancenoit and it is more fun (maybe because I played as Prussian) but the system runs very well and is really enjoyable.
Now I have to test the full battle!!!

Game design is excellent. Game play is tense and interesting.  

Played scenarios 1 & 2. Very good system.
Started the full battle on the Oct 26th - most enjoyable.

Arrived 22-10/15  - boxed edition. Beautiful components, excellent map. Counter quality is the best I have seen in 40 years of purchases and play. The map is lovely with large hexes. All in all a superior product.

Gorgeous componments. Very entertaining game, yet failing partially to simulate key factors of this battle like the French grand battery, the defense of the fortified farms or the cavalry attack of the squares. For instance, arguing that Ney's grand charges can be reproduced in a way that matches their historical result is just a joke or a false advertisement ( yes, cavalry rules are terrible... )  Also too many tweeks to balance the Allied army. However highly replayable.

Excellent opus sur le thème. Une grande jouabilité qui n'enlève rien aux sensations procurées en se retrouvant à la tête de l'armée. Vraiment un très bon rendu.
Déjà plusieurs parties à mon actifs avec le même camp et toujours autant autant d'ouverture à tenter. 
On se prend sans peine à imaginer d'autre scenarii dans la série et pourquoi pas, la campagne 16, 17 et 18 :)

RATING: 10
Waterloo 1815 : Fallen Eagle is a great game, a piece of art of Walter Vejdovsky : the simple system emphasizing on command and control of your army with little to no micro-management (no orientation nor formations) let you take command of your army, trying to get the things done with your divisions or corps while they suffer great attrition. Then you have to send your reserve at the right moment or you will loose everything. 
The full battle of Mont Saint-Jean, some 12 hours long, is fairly epic and difficult for both sides, the French being very powerful with strong artillery, corps and cavalry but having to draw Wellington from his strong positions before the Prussians can outflank him.
Everything about Waterloo is here, in this game.
The fantastic defence of the Foot Guard ? it is here !
The destruction of the cavalry charging unsupported against English squares ? it is here (and you shouldn't try it...) !
The clashes of heavy cavalry leading to complete oblivion ? it is here with great deal of drama and epicness !
The retreat of the Guard, leading to a full rout ? Also here !

And as if it was not enough, strategic cards allow you to modify on the operationnal level the whole battle : what if it didn't rain ? If Grouchy hated Strawberries instead of eating them and drove the Prussians from Wavre ?

There's so many in this game...And I haven't talked about the map...Just know that we (French people) got some DNA material from Rick Barber and were able to clone him...The name of the clone is Sebastien Brunel, a rising star !

Thanks Walter for that awesome game, thanks allowing me to play and replay it !

Waterloo 1815:FE is not a difficult game. It is more advanced than NLB but not exactly complicated. It has some quirks. The battle in itself is not the easiest one to make a good game out of. Defenders in fortified farms are really difficult to dislodge, which is historical in the case of Hougoumont but less so in the case of La Haye Sainte. I expect that a freer set-up is more desirable as the historical scenario appears quite hard to pull of for the French. The rules for cavalry are so and so, there could have been better rules. Over all, this is a somewhat better than average game, but less fantastic than described elsewhere.

My first board game.
I played this one so much that I consumed the counters, I had to buy a second one!
Similar to The ride and decline of the Third Reich, but more simpler, always strategic level.
It adds the research facility. You can do research so to pay less your infantry or to start producing missiles.

RATING: 9
A really great game that allows you to play the whole war with relatively accessible rules and a great system of research and development for unit types. Does take a long day to play it out but can be finished unlike others that become multi-day marathons. One can argue that it is oversimplifies things and allows possibly far-fetched strategies but this a view of unimaginative historical hindsight. Before WWII many of the things that did happen were generally not foreseen the way they did work out. So why create a game that is a strait jacket where everything must happen as it did? Indeed that approach was the weakness of SPI's WWII, which while more of a traditional wargame feel, was a disappointment.

The slapstick comedy version of WWII. Any resemblance
to history obtained by playing this is purely coincidental.
The designers used some intuitively sound seeming ideas,
but the combat system fails entirely in portraying the
actual events, and the production and research systems
create a gamey min-max type of atmosphere.

Still, like slapstick, there is something delightfully
absurd about playing this farce. It is indeed good fun,
and provides far more laughs and excitement than say,
Axis & Allies (which although simpler is far more realistic).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think a common mistake people make with this one is to go "all in" with the rules; I did the same thing "back in the day" when I was first exposed to it. The real game here is goes up to just the first set of optional rules. The final set of rules (carriers, leaders, etc.) are a mess and to be avoided. The even more extended fan optionals even more so. I revisited this with just the rules up to research et. al. and was actually quite impressed at how robust and clean the game was, generally speaking, and had to revise upwards my opinion. The short playing time is a huge win too; there is a lot of (generally pleasing) chaos in the system, but this means it can go a bit off the rails if someone is lucky or unlucky (say, a Soviet player who can't push down his cost of Infantry). The good news: it's done in a couple hours.
---
A neat little game that had a lot going for it (the research system was especially nice), but these days suffers from the same thing that dooms many of the middle-weight offerings from the 80s - too much complexity for not enough payoff. Hitler's War is in truth not *that* complicated, but it's enough stuff scattered all over the place to cause problems; it lacks the solid "central mechanism" of an Axis & Allies: Europe or EastFront, and as such feels complex because it's more of an aggregate of lots of little stuff, none of which is very important. Nontheless, one I would play again, and a game that is better than many of it's competitors (mainly Blitzkrieg General and Axis & Allies).

This design is full of unusual but brilliant ideas. A true strategic game, the players have to plan for their production. It plays faster than any other WW2 game and has more depth than most monster games on the subject. The scale of the game is huge : a few hexes for each country, 4 gaming turns per year.
Alas, there are crippling gaps in the rule book (sea invasions and morale rules for instance) that need  fixing. It would certainly be worth the trouble to make a revamp of this game.

For its time, HW was a decent game. And some of the core systems in HW are pretty good. I especially like:

<ul>
<li> The way combined-arms forces are represented through strength points on the roster sheets.
<li> The different capabilities of the different unit types.
<li> The assault/advance rules for representing mechanized combat.
<li> The short playing time, especially considering the wide scope of the game.
</ul>

But the game has a lot of problems, most of which center around the inclusion of too much chrome that's irrelevant for a grand-strategic level game:

<ul>
<li> The research rules have no basis in reality, involve far too much luck, and don't really add to the range of viable strategies. There are things like Inf and Mech and Bombers that you simply must research as much as possible, and others like Missiles that are basically useless. And I hate the way a few lucky/unlucky research die rolls can make a big difference in the size of force that can be bought by a side.
<li> There's no advanced planning of production. This means, for example, you can go from producing no bombers one turn to spending all your production on a huge bomber fleet the next turn. This leads to weirdness in strategic warfare.
<li> From cost/benefit analysis, you can easily see that some unit types are never worth building, such as missiles, A-Bombs, and aircraft carriers.
<li> There is too much detail in the naval subsystem (e.g. fleets and carriers) relative to its actual importance in the ETO. Handling of submarine/ASW warfare is reasonable, though.
<li> There are various problems with the timescale. In particular, we found that the Allies can't build enough Amphib units fast enough to make it possible to invade Italy and southern France. Instead, they're always better off just doing a single large Normandy-type invasion. And despite the coarse (4 month) game turn scale, armies can advance *very* fast across enemy territory, much faster than was historically possible. This makes the frontlines pretty fluid, but also makes the game "brittle" and quite unforgiving of mistakes.
</ul>

Overall, this is not a game I'm likely to want to play these days. "Barbarossa to Berlin" seems a better choice.

"Hitler's War" is a relic of it's time; an ambitious but dated attempt to draw the "Axis & Allies" crowd into more hardcore war games.  The game does a lot of things right.  It's hex-based, allowing flexible movement and supply cut-offs. It starts in 1939.  It employs an innovative and fluid strength point system which gives different units logical attributes and armies real character.  The tech development is actually superior to "A&A" in ways.  We also have a time track that gives suitable amounts of flavor but doesn't punish moves in opposition to history.  It also makes an effort to simulate everything in the war: partisans, bombing raids, anti-sub warfare, U-Boats, missiles, fleet actions, paratroops, leaders and even the A-bomb.  The only reason I don't rate it higher is because it's quite antiquated.  The rules set it back further than it deserves.  The programmed method of learning would have been great if not for the fact that the rules start to be contradictory.  The changes in fleet operations and amphibious attacks alone between the "Battle for Germany" scenario and the "Campaign II"/"Optional Rules" give me fits.  I swear that if someone bought the rights to this, streamlined the rules and improved the components, it would be a winner.  I'm hoping "Sturm Europa" may be the future WWII European theater game of my dreams but until then, "Hitler's War" is my favorite wannabe.

Very nice game. It fills the slot between and over simplistic Axis&Allies and more complex games. 
The rules are simple and straightforward, the gameplay tense even if I cannot commend on replayability: some choices seem better then others, but you have the feeling of total freedom (you may attack the US with the UK if you want!) so I don't feel the game to be streamlined in any way. The only problem is the number of Armies available that become for the Axis a true problem: I didn't see for this reason any advantage of executing Operation Barbarossa, and I would "turtle in" after conquering Poland and France. Nevertheless it is a clever game with excruciating choices, and a very stringent economic system. It does show its age, but I would recommend it.

Interesting design, not incredibly historical.

Optimal strategies in a game always turn me off. Let's not even talk about the Morale rules which turn the game into a "mad bomber" exercise...

RATING: 6
Unique high-level wargame about World War II in Europe.  The game is built around two mechanisms that are both brilliant yet terribly flawed.  The first is a research system whereby units become cheaper to produce as the technology behind building them improves.  There are some very nice mechanisms for handling this, but the effects are far too uneven.  Researching some technologies is nearly worthless, while getting a lead in others can be so decisive that it decides the game.  The second is the operational system.  The game is scaled at the army group level, which means that there are only a few units per side on the map.  Combat and movement are tied together; each enemy controlled hex that is entered needs to be attacked (even if vacant) to be captured.  The general object is to surround opposing army groups with your own, cutting them off and destroying them.  This renders the essence of blitzkrieg nicely.  The problem is that the system is designed around offensive operations.  With this small unit density, there's no way to set up a defensive line except on a narrow front.  In order for this kind of thing to work, some type of reaction system would probably be required.  Still worth a couple plays, but ultimately in the valiant failure category.

One of the games that I should have but I didn't.  Strategic in scope and fun for multiplayer.  I think it can do a strategic WW2 game in a simple (well, relative simple) without the calculating Third Reich die-rolls or the straight-jacket-everywhere rules in Europe Engulfed.  It didn't receive a special high praise among wargames. I guess it is because of the abscence of operational aspects (it is mostly about the war economy.  The military part is abstracted to the very grand strategic level) and the many players at the same time that would find appeals in "Hitler's" War.  I would try this someday.

RATING: 6
Preliminary rating is based on playing the Barbarossa and Fall of Germany scenarios. I like the basic mechanics, although there's a lot of record-keeping involved. The game seems to allow too much freedom in moving strength points around (you can transfer as many points as you want, over any distance, through any chain of friendly hexes, no matter how long or convoluted). The combat system slightly undervalues infantry, but it still works pretty well. The Fall of Germany scenario reinforced my opinion of the game and produced a very unrealistic quick victory by a deep armored Soviet thrust that captured Berlin. I don't think I'll play the campaign--too long and involved and not necessarily a productive scenario to play solo. Honestly, this is barely a 6 and might even deserve a 5.

I had this marked for trade but couldn't find it when a good offer was made. My apologies, but apparently it has gone missing. I was sure I had it still.

Needs a few fixes/variants to be balanced.  Germany seems to be too strong.  Interesting design and such a compact game.  

It would be interesting to see a modern design like this (compact, non-trivial, historical, strategic level WW2 game that still plays quickly).

RATING: 7.25
Short (based on its contemporary titles of the genre) hex-and-counter strategic level wargame.  Although the attack mechanisms should be renamed (assault and advance), they work relatively well - although it took us nearly two complete scenarios to complete the sequences correctly.  Units are army-level and represented as task forces on an off-board record sheet.  Programmed instruction helps digest an already-simple ruleset.  After playing the second scenario, some key vagaries in the rules (overstacking, forts, defensive assaults) really disenchanted this game for me.  Too bad.

RATING: 8
A very nice evolution of the classic Third Reich, but now technology is much more developed.  Who wouldn't like a game, where Russia, Britain, or Germany can develop the "bomb" before the U.S.?

someone please tell me. can ground units move from the netherlandsQ9 to KeilQ10 or not really.  Its vital for a couple of reasons.  I if they can then the german fleets are stuck in port until either they take denmark or netherlands and if the allies hold denmark keil may or may not need to be defended.  Thanks

I have the old Metagaming version which is graphically sparse. That said, the game succeeds at what it is trying to do - simulate the entire war in an easy-to-play format and can be played to completion in an afternoon. Yes, there are much better simulations out there and the AH verion is the better one to own since the graphics are light-years ahead of Metagaming's but the game does fill an important niche since not everyone has the time and/or inclination to play something bigger and more involved.

Everyone stresses that it's a poor simulation, but I was surprised at how "realistic" it is given how what it's trying to do (I'm comparing to A&A I guess). As much as I like programmed learning, the shorter scenarios aren't much; research really changes the game. I'd dump or revise the morale rules and am not sure what's going on with missiles, but you can adjust as needed. And it does have the whiff of a game that may reveal some loopholes and gamey strategies once played enough times. Still, it's great fun.

RATING: 7
Just the intro Barbarossa scenario so far. A very different wargame feel where attrition and taking ground are very separate things. It's not about counting movemant factors, hex by hex, nor is it moving strong armies hither and yon; Strength Points are freely reallocated every turn among any of up to 12 armies, with unlimited movement in friendly territory. Has both interesting strategic and tactical decisions. The only drawback is playing time. As with many wargames, the amount of onboard action is not nearly as grand as with a typical Euro. But for a wargamer this isn't an issue because the game is really in one's head, just acted out on the board with the random element of a 1D6. (Euros more often use card play for randomness over rolling dice, but it's there nonetheless.) Computer version listed above works pretty well for the Barbarossa scenario (Germans 2 (both early wins), Russians 1 (last die roll victory as Germans fail to take Stalingrad).

This game is absolutely broken.  The Germans build up a large army of maximum troop strength and unlimited aircraft and there is no unit the Allies can field against it.  All you can do is point defend your capitals, and you don't really have the production to do that well.  This is memory from 20 years ago, but I *hated* this game.  Maybe AH fixed it somehow?

A very good idea and a game that I would really like to work.  Unfortunately, the amphibious rules are completely broken and the game suffers from unnecessary mid-80's complexity.  It would be a prime candidate for a re-design and streamlining.

RATING: 9
Innovation in game design is something that appeals to me and this game was very innovative indeed. Prior to the AH publication I had the Metagaming Concepts original version - sold in a tiny box with a paper map - never in the history of gaming can so much brilliance have been squeezed into such a small space! WWII at a grand-strategic level with economic production, technological research, armoured breakthroughs, para-drops, amphibious landings etc etc. Some say the game that 3rd Reich should have been. Really excellent - I can't quite understand why it doesn't poll higher ratings.

This game gets a lot of gruff over it's inaccuracy as a simulation and history.  If that's what you're after, you shouldn't be looking at this one.  This is fun game that looks like WWII's ETO and I don't think it was really meant to be more than that.

RATING: 4
‘Hitler’s War’ offers some intriguing design concepts but is an unfinished product, a design that was never subjected to development or testing.  It is entirely unsuitable for instructional purposes and will remain so unless and until developed into a finished product with competently organized, complete and coherent rules.  A thorough-going graphical ‘face-lift’ would help, too.  However, the game is an artifact at this point; numerous newer products offer comprehensive European Theater of Operations (ETO) coverage that instructors can employ for pedagogical purposes.  Nonetheless, theoreticians of modeling concepts and publishers seeking promising prototypes for development and re-publication might find value in some of the rough-hewn concepts this game featured.

I have elaborated a bit on these remarks in the Files section (‘Hitler's War (AH)_AASGC Review’)

Nice. Fun. Hitler's War was a go-to-game in the 80's because it was so accessible. As an extra bonus it was the first I had seen with a pretty fun technology tree. An many ways I found it superior to the ultra-gamey Fall of the Third Reich and SPI's attempts which were either extremely simple or too large and complicated. A unique experience.

Si te gustó el SimCity de PC, ésta es la mejor implementación a juego de mesa que se ha hecho :D Cuidado que es largo (+ de 2 horas y 1a partida mucho más, alta curva de aprendizaje) y tiene miga, sobretodo cuesta planificar el espacio, pero se disfruta mucho!
El juego tiene mucha variedad, y además tiene expansiones/variantes muy interesantes que todavía le dan más vida y rejugabilidad al juego. (Mirad la del discurso del Alcalde, si no os gusta el puteo del original, o la variante de los parques, que sólo puedes construirlos de Nivel 1, pero también crecen)
Mirar las reglas en inglés del autor y las FAQs. La traducción en castellano colgada en BGG, estoy pendiente de retocarla, ya que tiene varios fallos de traducción y alguno gráfico que lían bastante.

Heavy, beautiful city-building game. THIS is the closest thing to the delicious, evolving bureaucracy of something akin to Sim City: The Board Game. 

However, it fell a bit flat for my wife and I. Ultimately I think it's a flawed masterpiece. The core of the game is brilliant, and the intuitive organic expansion of your city is riveting. However, there is too much exceptional rules minutia for our taste. I'd say we could muscle through it, but in the end, there are too many fabulous and streamlined games to rate this higher then them. It's a tough call--seriously. This game is truly excellent, but riddled with lots of little things which keep me from rating it higher.

The rules are heavy, but natural, the gameplay wasn't boring at all, but the game is far too long. Sometimes I play games from this lenght, but I'm sure with enough time I will play another game. It's a real puzzle to make all things right and the possibilities are wide. So far everything is good, but I don't think this will see the table often.

Take the following with a giant grain of salt. Excluding a few learning games, I feel like I've only fully, and correctly, played the game once. Some of this is for my own reference if I get the itch to buy this game again, especially since Mr. Viard's games appeal to me. Small City is, no doubt, an interesting game. However, it seemed long for what it is. The automatic growth is the fun part of the game, but the other systems seemed a little rough or too many. The various sub-systems didn't seem to integrate with each other as smoothly as a Lacerda game. Due to the length and seeming roughness to the overall system, I moved this out of my collection, as I'll get the automatic growth at a lower play time in Card City XL and, if I want something heavier, I have Lacerda games that I prefer to this system. I'd play Small City again if I ran across someone with a copy that wants to play, but its not one that I need to own.

----------------------
I found the engine building aspect of this one really interesting, but again found the puzzle of placing tiles a little wonky.  I liked the game, and thought it was fun, but I am not crazy with it at this point.  The production quality on this one is much better than Clinic, and I do feel it kind of takes 1 play of this one to really wrap your head around it.  One I would like to try again soon.  Also interested to check out the advanced rules...

It reminds me of a chromey version of Antiquity meets Town Center.  One thing I'm learning about Viard is he's all about the auction/turn order selection.  So, each game feels like it's got a chromey/fiddly mechanic for it.  

Excepting that, I really like Small City... tight money, tetris-style special power building, a small amount of interaction.  I continue to waffle on keeping this, but that's more because my opportunities to play it are small.  Very good game.

Juego de construcción de ciudades, tipo simcity. Muy interesante. Hay edificios residenciales, industriales, culturales, servicios, comercios y energia, con determinadas reglas para colocarlos. Los industriales pueden producir recursos que se pueden convertir en ventajas a través de los comercios. Además, también puedes enviar "turistas" a las ciudades de otros jugadores.  Cada vez que se produce, se crea un nivel de polución que se va acumulando a lo largo de la partida, que dura 9 turnos. Al final de la partida, obtienes los puntos que has conseguido menos la polución acumulada. Además, puedes llevarte bonus extra por unas cartas de "estrategias" que debes cumplir. Es un auténtico quemacerebros. Muy, muy recomendable, aunque creo que solo para jugones. 

Lo jugué porque lo tiene Max, pero creo que viene de un KS y está a un precio prohibitivo. Creo que unos 70€ o así. El juego es bueno, pero tampoco está justificado ese precio. Lo de los KS se ha convertido en una locura.

I'm glad, I gave Small City a second chance. In our first play, we missed the rule that you get 1$ income for each tourist. This little oversight turned Small City into a real cut throat experience which I didn't enjoy.

With the correct rules, which we used in our second play, the game felt much better and I had some fun developing my part of the city. Still, Small City is a heavy game and because of my limited gaming time, I'm not always in the mood to commit so much time to a single game. So, if I had to rate it today, I would give it a 6 or 7. But since I've only had one correct play, I'll reserve judgement until I've had another chance to play the game again.

Too long and convoluted for me. Besides it feels very scripted, I guess you could make one perfect build strategy layout and just use that one in every game for maximum points.

Nice city builder, enjoyable puzzle. Try to build your city, keep your election promises and keep polution low. The 'self growing' mechanism adds a nice twist.

The mayor blocking two spaces is an annoyance, I can see this to be problematic in a two player game. However with 3+ you aren't suffering too much from this 'take that' principle.

Just played it for the first time and found it a bit too heavy for my taste. Repeated plays can make this easier and more enjoyable for those willing to persevere. There are just too many specific rules for the various buildings and a lot of iconography to digest. The lack of player interaction and the overall flat experience makes it a game I will most usually pass on.

Nem egyszerű játék az biztos, néhol egyértelműen ráfért volna egy kiadó, hogy gatyába rázza a dolgokat. Emiatt pár helyen nem igazán elegáns, fiddly maradt a játék. De mindezek ellenére nagyszerű kis játékról van szó. Mélyen tematikus, egyedi mechanikák, kemény döntések. A szerepválasztós mechanika nagyon tetszett, az építések optimalizálásában valószínűleg igen-igen sok van. A máshoz beköltözés is sokat ad a játékhoz, nagyon át kell gondolni, hogy mi milyen sorrendben fog megtörténni. Kicsit emiatt a költözés miatt volt olyan érzésem, hogy a legjobb épületeket nem annyira érdemes megépíteni, mert más fogja használni helyetted. Persze rendőrséggel védhető, de azért az már elég nagy macera. Nagyszerű a munkahelyekkel összefüggő beköltözési kedv is. Érezhetően a tematika volt a központba a tervezésnél, és sikerült nagyszerű mechanikákat találni hozzá. Megérdemelne egy kiadót, kis streamlinosítást és egy igazi kiadást.

Initial Impression
The rule book is bad, there is a misprint on the board and certain things are not very clear or easy to miss. Take a look at bgg forums before playing. This is a ding from me on rating

With that said, the game was interesting. The layout reminds me of urban sprawl board, very grid based city building. You aren't competing for tiles since everyone has access to them all but it's about properly laying out your city. There is also player interaction with tourist, selecting roles and mayor blocking.

I'd be interested in trying the advance game. I could see the variability of this game going down after a few plays once you figure out proper positioning and "figure" things out. But I also know there are a lot of small expacs for this game so maybe they keep the game fresh enough

RATING: 7
Bunch of things going on and this game desperately needs a good player aid. Score could go up 1 or down 1 after my next play. It's city building/planning with trying to keep pollution under control as at the end of the game any pollution points are negative points. Rule book is a hard read through to figure out what is going on.

This is THE city building game.  So much to love!  So much replayability with alternate victory conditions, new maps, and extra tiles.  This is one of those games I find myself thinking about at random times, considering new things to try.  There are a fair bit of rules, but most of it gels after a game or two.  (The solo game is good to hash out the basics before introducing it to others.)  Much of the play is simultaneous, which makes the game feel like it is clipping along, even if it takes a couple hours.  With that, your first multiplayer game should be 2 players, or maybe 3 if experienced games.  However, it plays wonderfully at any player count.

That said, my rating requires the tweak to the function of the Mayor.  Getting blocked in the last round at a key location after multiple rounds of careful planning is simply no fun.

Other than that, this is a marvel of a game!

Components: ok components
Complex: not so difficult rules, lot of things going on
Weight: heavy
Players: 3
Length: 2 hours, more or less
Mechanics: city building (I know this would be the category, but I think is the best way to reflect what is going on)
Decisions: a lot, which bonus to take, turn order, what to build, should I expand, what development
Opinion: only one thing to say... Love it!!! I like city building games, and this one is awesome. The rules are not so difficult to understand, although your brain could explode after the explanation or rules reading, but everything makes click after the first turn, and everything makes sense in the game...
Build residentials, but not close to industry, if residentials are close to cultural they will upgrade, commercials next to residentials and so on...
Citizens come to your City Hall, then move to small residentials (yes, they are poor and cannot afford something more expensive), from there they move around the world, and more citizens come to your borough if you have free industry, as you are creating more work.
Briefly... you select a bonus to start the round, build several buildings or expand your borough (with automatic upgrades if requirements are met), move citizens to work or rest or to other boroughs as tourists, receive income, check your pollution (people in your borough generate dirt, as well as factories working) and go for some development. All this done in a lovely way.
About the citizen movement, liked the mechanic, you can send some to other boroughs to mess with their buildings while you take advantage of the building, and you cannot repeat the same space twice in a row.
The pollution is going to kill you, but you are taking some advantages on it too.
Only flaw I could see is that some players could tend to AP, in the building phase and in the movement phase, the latter should be done as fast as you can, but in the end of the game you could have so many people to move...
Finishing my comments, loved the game, willing to play again soon (loved all, the planning and building phase, the movement, how people come to your borough and how they are moving around, the pollution issue....)

I find this quite fun but lack of development will keep it from being played much in my group. Rules are not that difficult to remember once you have learned them but they are not smooth. Has the sense of many small rules added to fix playtest issues but needs smoothing out. 

Has some very interesting mechanics. The roundel to pick roles and the city growing by itself are very cool. Really does need the expansions to add variety.

RATING: 8.8
Note: This is only my first impression based on one play using the solo variant in the rule book.

Small City is a mind melting puzzle that remains enjoyable due to the escalating scoring and the beauty of seeing your small city grow into a thriving, although perhaps polluted, metropolis.  

The zoning restrictions are logical and thematic.  The manner in which buildings and neighborhoods automatically sprawl (i.e. upgrade) based on the mix of adjacent buildings adds a lot of depth. 

Small City, however, is complicated and I'll need repeated plays to understand how utilize the resource generation and commercial operations to maximize my scores.  Nevertheless, I am eagerly anticipating playing this with more players.

For a self-published game, I am very impressed with the components and attention to detail that went into developing the game.  I am a fan of the art style, presentation, and graphic design.

requires some forum reading to fully understand the rulebook

after 2 plays of the basic game: 

I'm not convinced on the mayor, it seems like 1st player isn't attractive enough for other players not to leave the mayor in your city, permenantly blocking a juicy space for multiple rounds

This is easily the best city building game, it's longer than suburbia, city council etc, but it's well worth it, you have far more control and arn't at the mercy of the randomness.

Wow. What a rich and complex game this is! The first play was long and rough as it takes most of the game to start to internalize the construction rules. While everyone is building their own borough, movement rules allow players to move their citizens to other boards to produce goods and make money. While citizens visiting other boroughs can collect some great things (and block players from collecting goods and money from their own buildings), they are also at risk of getting killed off by that borough's high pollution. This makes everyone's personal player board a shared space, of sorts and this really gives the game its unique feel more than anything.

There are a eight steps on a turn, more than one of which are consequential and require consideration. Late in the game, turns can go long as players ponder their move options each turn. There are a lot of choices! I had feared that the building rules would end up more cumbersome than fun, but I needn't have worried. The production on this game is on par with Splotter titles - Viard used Splotter's manufacturer - so this game is similarly under-produced in a charming way. It has the wide-open, forge-your-own-path game play I love so much. A little rules heavy, for sure. I look forward to playing this again and again.

There are some really interesting mechanics in this game. The tourist mechanic has a tendency to draw out the game quite significantly though. It makes it close to impossible to preplan your turn. Especially the first time playing the game. Additionally i suspect that the initial setup is a bit too static and if played enough times, people will start settling into very consistent building patterns an strategies. Additionally the promise cards seems like a very ill conceived mechanic since it is much easier to just pay a couple of coins or points. Instead of a high likelihood of loosing 5 points.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really enjoy this city building game although it may well have a few extra aspects in the game that could have been smoothed out with a little more development. Oftentimes, I enjoy those little quirks and those sure don't bother me here. This is still very much a puzzle of a game as one must be careful how to place one's buildings. One can also lose workers due to pollution - pollution can be quite nasty. I would highly recommend playing with the parks variant as the standard way to play as the parks feel overpowered otherwise. Wish it came in a regular sized box!

Alban has given players perhaps the best tabletop implementation of a SimCity-esque game.

Small City gives players a fairly wide open canvas upon which to work, but keeps them in line with the right amount of restrictions in the forms of pollution and the forced rotation of workers to keep them on their toes.

The role selection each round gives a nice start layer of player interaction, and the ability to send workers to other players' boards ramps that up.  Though remember, these traveling workers do face the perils of pollution if they go to a city facing too much pollution...

The only thing keeping me from getting more plays of this in is finding players who can give it repeat plays.  The layers of this game reward those who continue to explore, and I do intend to explore as much as I could.

This game can be really mean, but you have to tease it out as the charming illustrations provide a false sense of lightness.  The question of where to place the mayor gets easier as the game goes on, which can be frustrating if you're on the receiving end of him - but he's only going to be really devastating if the stars align just right.  At 2p the stars can seem fixed in the firmament, which will be either good or bad.

The back two-thirds(!) are minor adjustments to stick the landing.   There's not too much interaction in this game but it's enough to keep you on your toes.

The expert board really is hard; the parks variant is essential.  Have not played with the peaceful mayor, but suspect it works well.  I think I would prefer using the mayor to block, promoting agile cities, but the production-management and layout incentives for the peaceful mayor sound interesting.

[b]2016-05-01 8.0[/b] After 3x 2p 1x 4p:
One of my favourite city building games. The building growth and precious real estate are so fun to juggle. It effectively retires some of our other city building games, especially those with unpredictable markets. The rules seem a bit daunting or fiddly to begin with. But after 2 games or so, they stick quite well and it is easy to structure everything in your head to teach. One minor gripe: The 6-pt and 12-pt endgame scoring cards are not often used as players try to aim for 18-pt goal. It results in low variability if players are to stick with the base game Votes victory.

First solo play: wow, did I mess up the pollution!  At level 92, so my final score was -47.  Gotta figure out how to keep that down!  Of course, I forgot and scored pollution for those in the Town Hall, but that would not make too much of a difference.  Much easier building rules in practice than on paper.  The symbols on the board were a bit unclear to me but the basic flow of the game is pretty straightforward.  Definitely looking forward to a multiplayer game and to see how others handle the pollution!

Right: build parks.  I need to build parks.  Plus, I did not adequately understand the free upgrades.  Knowing this, I did better but still lost because I had too much pollution compared to my opponent.  Great little game.

June 16: Right, this time I kept down the pollution.  Actually, I think it is too bad when everyone spends so much effort keeping down pollution as it is a fun part of the game, but my opponents were obsessed with it, so I had to do the same or lose badly.  We added tons of expansions and had a great game, but took close to four hours.

Interessante gioco con ambientazione edilizia. Il gioco offre diverse modalità di sviluppo e la possibilità di scegliere diversi 'scenari'. Nel complesso è un gioco semplice ma le fasi di programmazione, l'elevato numero di variabili ed edifici rende il tutto un po' confuso. Anche la grafica, quasi da playtest, lo relega ad un prodotto di nicchia. Il gioco per la verità risulta strategicamente molto interessante e difficile da pianificare, sicuramente va giocato più volte per avere un quadro più chiaro del tutto. Sicuramente passato troppo inosservato.

心得:
遊戲建築細項規則頗多
許多建築區域會增長是有趣的設定
主題還算蠻貼切的
會讓一開始行動毫無頭緒
整體規劃很重要(如果蓋了就不允許動的話)
訪客讓遊戲互動增加
商場跟工廠不能連續踩的限制讓遊戲思考度增加
不過任務難易度實在是有差
發展路線是否很多是個問題
蠻難有機會開的遊戲
規則:
*回合標記放上，八張行動卡(有星的先移除)，根據分數把目標卡分成三疊，地下鐵醫院大學警察局消防局都比人數少1放在供應區，隨機起始拿市長
*每人拿一圖版(選擇簡單或專家面)，市政廳123格文化建築，精煉廠港口各1，拿走一個顏色標記，圓片一個記分，兩個到中央議會區，一個記城區大小，兩個記汙染，最後一個之後放行動卡用，市政廳放進城區並放三個工人，準備區放11個工人，照順位拿錢4/5/5/6元，三疊目標卡各抽1並選一張保留
*遊戲進行8輪，每輪有8階段，結束後所有分數+目標卡分數-汙染數最高獲勝
1.特殊行動 行動卡洗勻圍成一圈，照順位放圓片選擇特殊行動，下個玩家選上個玩家相鄰的不用錢，每差一格1元(被選的不算在內)
*建築師 蓋文化建築可少花一個資源，只能使用在一棟上
*協調者 建築少花1元，但是最少要1元
*城市顧問 可付資源前進一個市政廳軌，成長要在建築階段才會成長
*所有非起始玩家放市長米寶到起始玩家城區，某兩格不能建造或是事長放在市政廳的兩格連續空格上(沒有就放旁邊)，相鄰的六格每個人產1分，最多2分
2.建設 基本上可以改三棟建築 或是蓋一棟建築更成長城區，所有玩家用擋版同時規劃蓋
>文化建築要花資源蓋，其他建築如果符合規則任何大小都可以蓋，1格1元
>每個建築所有相鄰包括對角格都是影響區，市政廳算文化建築
>建築行動可換成拆除行動，每格1元且會增加1格汙染
>當回合蓋的建築要下回合才可成長(商業/住宅/工廠)，成長只要符合資格即可，不需花錢
>成長時工廠跟商業區原本位置產的東西要一樣，有工人就維持在上面
>住宅區 一格的蓋了市政廳的人馬上會過去，兩格已上附近有被同樣數目的文化建築影響，上面的市民會產分數，每一區分開計算，不能在工廠影響區
>工廠 1格的會伴算一個倉庫在影響區，2格要精煉港口至少1，3格要都有(2,3不會有倉庫)，精煉港口也不能影響住宅區，港口2元蓋，水的部分沒有影響力
>商業區 每1格旁邊需要有對應數量的住宅區，工人在上面對應格有對應效果
>文化建築 自己的不需啟動有效果，地鐵不需啟動可派兩人去別人城區工作，醫院啟動不會死人，大學啟動產3分
>警察局消防局 上面有人可啟動，警察影響力範圍內不能被他人使用，消防局派出去的人不會死(被警察局趕走的回到該玩家市政廳，每格則回圖板供應區)
>公園沒任何限制，會降低汙染，作者變體只能從1蓋，有人在上面才會成長
3.移動市民 市政廳以外的人自由移動(可到其他人那邊工作，但每個其它玩家你只能派一個)
>只有住宅區跟特殊建築的人可以不動，工廠跟商業區同格不能連續回合使用，他人可用
>移動到其他人版圖的工人每回合一定要移動，如果產資源你沒地方放就要送給該版圖玩家
>所有移動完後，市政廳的人會移到自己圖版上1格大小的住宅區，工廠有幾個沒人就會有幾個人從職業所到市政廳
4.收入 每個旅客1元，商業版塊對應格啟動，工廠版塊獲得資源，資源不能亂棄
>市政廳只能存總共4個資源或人
5.投票 每個住宅區根據裡面有幾個人拿對應分數，大學啟動有3分
6.汙染 每個市政廳跟死掉以外城區上的人(包括旅客)，生產幾個資源加總扣掉公園格數為汙染值，汙染超過100直接退出遊戲，有人汙染超過10後，該回合汙染最多的死一人，死掉的人債城區一格，之後死的要盡量接近，平手則比汙染總值多的，在平手就都死人

Ordered the game, then read the rulebook. Or, tried to read it. Big mistake. I immediately cancelled my order.  What a mess. seriously in need of an editor and proof reader. Makes it look like the game was either rushed out or put together in a basement. Numerous syntax errors, unneeded words, poorly organized, jumbled and non intuitive attempts to explain what is clearly a fiddly game. Fiddly games need to have clear rulebooks.

I had read warnings about the rules but after getting througn Madeira, Zhanguo, polis hegemony, Vinhos without a problem, I didn't expect this to be a challenge. After the fourth instance of repeated sentence fragments in the same line, I was already frustrated. Luckily, I was able to cancel my order before it shipped. Game may have merit, but my rating is based on the rulebook.

Excellent excllent city building game ...one of the best we have played ...a real brain burner that has been heavily influenced by my all time favourite game form Splotter games ...Antiquity ...

Very clever puzzle / engine building with a fair bit of interaction during various stages of the game...

Small publisher with reasonable quality components ...like Splotter you seemed to get enough pieces for a whole army of players lol...

Pretty clear rules ...and lots of expansions now available but it would take yrs to exhaust the main game ...

Not a quick game and strongly suggest avoid playing with those prone to AP too often ...

As I result of this game plus Radhos run through I am going to pick up the Clinic...

The gameplay is superb. Every player is trying to build his economy and fulfilling objectives and in the meantime controlling the polution level of it's city. I just abolutely don't like the look of it. So as with Supurbia there goes another game I didn't buy.

RATING: 8
It's like Antiquity and Urban Sprawl had a love child.

I don't think this game is as rules heavy as other reviewers *cough*vasel*cough* let on. Yes, the game is a bit more complex spatially as well as it being quite a brain burner, but I never felt weighed down by the rules. I also didn't feel it was as mean as what was initially let on. I do worry that the building constraints are pretty heavy and force you to build awkwardly, but I suppose it's part of the charm.

I have yet to play on the "expert" side or the advanced game, but man it looks brutal.

City building with finely tuned costs and benefits to each type of development, civic, commercial, manufacturing, and residential.  Stellar, smooth game play.  Lots of tiles and meeples to move, which is great if you like that (I love that).

I think it will go up after more Plays. The first 2 Player Game together with my wife was great Fun. At the beginning a little bit fiddly, but you get used to it really fast. 

Great Mechanisms, and also thematical enough (for the People who need to know this ;))

Although it was great un i think we scored really bad in the end. But in my opinion this is a game that has to be learned being played.

A game I bought on a whim. I enjoy city building games and this seemed to be the perfect one. Rules are complicated if you haven't played Alban's games in the past. It is the 3rd game in a trilogy and I hadn't played the other games (or at least 1 game of Town Center doesn't count, for me). Played a few times and it is becoming clearer with each play. A bit long for my taste but I am looking forward to playing it more to discover what I can do.

Now this is a city builder! Each round in this game players build 1-3 building tiles, or they build 1, and expand the area they are allowed to cover on their boards. The building tiles are tetrominoes, and their placement rules and abilities change slightly depending on their size. Similar to in Town Center, to have a larger building it needs a certain number of adjacencies of the correct colors. This can be extremely challenging, because while this is all happening you need to worry about creating enough jobs to attract new meeples to your board, and you need to worry about managing your pollution levels, because each turn you accrue pollution which converts directly to negative points at the end of the game, and worse yet, other players can send one of their meeples to your city, to get in your way and take those crucial action spaces on your buildings that you so carefully constructed.

The game is complicated, tense and really fantastic. I can't wait for more plays of this game.

--Jul2015-- It's intriguing, in that hates-all-players kind of way that reminds me a bit of Neuland (with the original rules, naturally) and four players.  It's a ferocious forward-placement problem that (fortunately) ends just before that placement becomes completely intractable.  I'm not convinced I'll ever love it; but I could come to enjoy it more in time.

當初的賣點是 Alban Viard 的城市系列最新作，所以自然而然以為又是個小遊戲，結果突然變成了一個深策大盒遊戲，所以非常期待。玩了以後，發現自己前半場基本都在懵逼……他喵的這個遊戲到底要怎麼搞？？？？實在想吐槽遊戲規則未免太煩。不過遊戲的套路還是很有趣的，可惜被過分繁瑣的規則淹沒了，遊戲中各種限制條件太多，導致城市建設並沒有想像中的愉快，相比之前同類型的《郊區（Suburbia）》，該作還是太無趣了些

RATING: 6.5
Complex city-building game from Alban Viard that takes the growth/upgrade mechanism from Town Center and expands it with workers, pollution, factories, tourists visiting other player boards, hidden goals etc.

I'm inclined to think it's a step backwards: managing growth is easily the most engaging part of the game and Town Center already did it and did it better. Part of the problem is that many of the additional mechanisms don't seem to work very well. The character rondel is unnecessarily reshuffled every round, for example, making planning for it difficult; tourists stuff up incentives to build. The mayor as written is far too swingy (the official "peaceful mayor" variant is far superior). Goal cards appear to be wildly unbalanced.

There's a lot to like, and if you like solitaire optimization puzzles then it's an engaging one. If you like high interaction, look somewhere else. Since many of the less-effective elements of the design apply only to multiplayer games, and significant downtime is added to boot, I think it's best as a solo game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The potential I saw in the rules didn't quite come across in the gameplay, but I've only played solo so far.
Update April 2017 - Sold, just not the game I wanted it to be, and a little too formulaic for my tastes. The hunt for the great city building game continues.

RATING: 7
A very well designed game with varied levels of decisions and synergy. Easier to play than I initially thought after reading the rules, but playing well is really tough (don't get frustrated on your first few tries as mistakes and errors will be made). 

This game hits on all cylinders, and thematically it makes sense. A worth successor (equal?) to CliniC. 

Has many expansions, we really haven't explored them much lately.

RATING: 6.25
Okay city building game. It has some really neat things, like the special card selection at the start of each turn, and the ebb and flow of building up a city. However, the game can be super AP prone as you need to position things so their influence zone allows for proper growth. Also, the game can be very long for what it is. Finally, I don't know how much replayability the game has as there isn't a ton of randomness or variability that is introduced each game. The "bonus objective" cards seem to be very imbalanced, with going for one that you'll obviously complete when going for VP seems the best (as the effort for others isn't worth it generally). I think I might play it one more time now that I have an idea of what to expect from start to finish, but unless it played differently I don't think it is something I'd ever seek out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Looks heavy, dry as wallpaper. 
Not a real fan of puzzle games nor civ-building games.

Somehow it reminded me of Carson city (role selection + tile placement) but it seems to have very few interaction for a lot more work. 

My gaming group (heavy into interaction) will never play this, my wife will find it waaay to heavy and I'm more into theme. Pass.

After two plays of Small City I wanted more. After 11 I still do. It is a shame the English rules are not that great because it causes quite a bit of confusion. More rules and not as streamlined as its godmother Antiquity but not as harsh either and there is more timing and player interaction in Small City. That I like a lot. The spatial aspect of the game is great. Inspired by Town Centre you need to build other types of buildings next to a building for it to grow automatically and you cannot build the large one straight away unless you already have the needed buildings. That makes it the game a cool dynamic spatial puzzle with a tight economy. As in all Viard games, there a lots of variants and expansion modules if and when you need new challenges.

Expansions: Player Board Expansion No. 1, 2 and 3; Character Meeple Expansion No. 1 and 2; The Big Tiles Expansion; Small City around the World #1: Asian Cities.

This is much more of an actual game than Town Center or Card City. However, it still has problems. The rulebook is one: it's very poorly written and in some places it is simply incorrect. More importantly, it seems to be very dependent on turn order. Getting points from building materials is easier and more efficient than getting them from residences, but the way things work it's entirely possible to be shut out of that unless players build lots of I3s and C4s. It's possible that one of the advanced game victory conditions would be better, but I don't like the game enough to try playing again, at least with more than two players. (With two the turn order isn't an issue.)

Pretty heavy economic tile placement city builder sim that accepts adjacency...yeah! This game introduces to me some interesting new mechanics and uses clever and provoking twists on some old ones. I love how city building types can grow on their own when certain conditions exist. I like how the game system simulates the flux of population growth (and loss) based on available jobs, housing and the pollution level. I dig how worker movement represents workforce relocation. The rondel concept added to Puerto Rico style Civic worker roles is great. The favor system to represent bribes and kickbacks works well and adds a too familiar aspect of bureaucratic corruption.  Some of the rules are pretty obscure which takes a bit to become familiar. I even enjoy (though annoying as Hell at times) the interference of the First Player Mayor. With this, plus the rondel cost of roles, and Ora et Labora style of workers placed on other player bouroughs creates a good amount of interaction.

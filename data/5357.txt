GAME: Von Manstein's Backhand Blow
RANK: 3381
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The designer took this system over from the games he had designed for Moments in History and it was supposed to be the start of many in the Schwerpunkt system for GMT. To date the only one. Deals with third battle of Kharkov and Von Mansteins restoration of the German front after the disaster at Stalingrad. The use of chits add great variation and the system plays clean and quickly. Nice map and counters ad up to a fine game. How about another please?

Fairly standard design with a few twists like the 3 players sub-segments each turn using C3i points and the combat chit based on Tactical Rating system.

OK overall but like others have noted, combat results are unpredictable. CRT is very attritional especially for attacker.

Does not work very well for me, far too long to play (about 4 hours + for intro scenario), I can't see how I could get through the grind of the 17 turns campaign.

Nice system.  Good for solitare play and would be quite exciting with two players.  The 3CI element was one I had not encountered in other games and I found it to add the randomness not found in other games that makes the players feel more like the actual commanders with that touch of the uncertain lingering in the background.

RATING: 3
Clever and interesting mechanics on the operational side, but I think the game is ultimately killed by the combat system. The whole chit-pull thing brings the game to a screeching halt during combat resolution and is amazingly fiddly - I would have much preferred a simple way to integrate tactical superiority (as in the OCS surprise rules) over this time-consuming one. This combined with a CRT that is hugely random even at high odds means combat is very dicey - particularly for the attacker. It's pretty rare to get more than a hit or two once combat chits have taken their effect, so usually the defenders walk away pretty much scot-free while the attackers take losses, even at extremely high odds (like, 10:1).

Also, the pace of the game is too slow. 10 hours for the whole thing? I think not. Too much lather-rinse-repeat for my tastes, with the turns just not having enough variety or action. I really like the whole schwerpunkt mechanic of "bonus" actions, but it means the game just takes *so* long to play. And with the choice between an uninteresting learning scenario (4 turns) and a "real" but very large scenario, it's not much of a choice. This is a system that wants to be played for 4, maybe 6 hours at the outside.

I am also unconvinced on the balance issues. I don't see how the Germans are ever going to get enough combat factors to stage a plausible counter-attack. The odds you need to get to have a chance of accomplishing something meaningful are immense, and rarely are going to come up. Which brings to my last gripe: wow, there is a lot of math here. We were adding up attack factors and getting into triple-digits for some attacks. The numbers just get too large to easily handle.

Also, there are tons of production issues - many if not most German counters have the wrong turn of reinforcement printed on them, some setup codes are wrong, the TEC has a formatting issue, and the rules are needlessly opaque for a simple game.

Anyway. Playing the short game once was OK, but I am not inclined to play again however. There just isn't enough excitement in the game. Even though I wasn't a huge fan of A Victory Lost, that game is just more fun and seems like it actually might have some semblance of balance.

RATING: 5
My preliminary rating after 1 play of the 4 turn short scenario is positive.

I enjoy the system. I like the concept of tactical superiority, which ties into the chit drawing, which provides some variability in the combats instead of a straight up die roll. The C3I command system is an interesting mechanism that provides a nice way of both creating and restricting large offensives.

This is definitely a step up from [i]A Victory Lost[/i] in terms of realistic game play, but then it's a longer game, too. It appears to sit between [i]A Victory Lost[/i] and [i]Ukraine 43[/i] in terms of complexity.

I'm not sure what I think about the ability to avoid step losses via retreats. This may provide too much of an advantage to the defender, but more play is required for me to make a final judgement.

Update: After another play, as much as I like the C3I concept, I just don't think the game works overall. The CRT makes it very difficult to cause any kind of damage when combined with the retreat rules, advancing is difficult due to the EZOC restrictions which turns the game into zoc-chess, and the tactics chits get to be tedious.

RATING: 9
One of my favorites. This game does everything right. The rules have a lot of interesting innovations, such as the limited ability to move and attack with your army during the schwerpunkt segments. Gameplay feels desperate and nail-biting from both German and Russian perspectives. Combat GREATLY favors the defender in this game. The chit pull system for combat modifiers, along with random events and SNAFUs, enhance the unpredictability of the game without feeling arbitrary. Gameplay takes a few turns to master, but quickly becomes sleek and intuitive. GMT's production values are terrific as usual. But the rules and gameplay are where this game really shines. I'd love to see more games done using this system. I can't recommend this one enough.

I might have rated this game a perfect 10 if there was more variety in the scenarios. As it stands, there are only two. The first is a short 4 turn introductory scenario (with no weather effects) which is a good way to learn the system, but it is almost impossible for the Soviet player to win. Then there is the full 17 turn monster scenario.

RATING: 5
I haven't played this ftf yet, but after my solo plays I like this. Schwerpunkt rules are fast but not very complicated. C3i points simulate nicely concentration and preparation for important sectors. Also the battle is very interesting. My only problem with the game is that the starting situation does seem to be too good for the Wehrmacht. The Red Army can break the line easily and put germans on the run but after the retreat behind Donets the situation stabilizes. The Red Army doesn't have the forces nor supply lines the make the great thrusts for Stalinograd or Dnepropetrovsk or Poltava. Thus there are no feel for the great danger that existed for the whole Army Group South nor the need for the great backhand blow. But still, the game system is great and it is fun the play althought I don't think it is an accurate simulation for the one of the most interesting battles of the Eastern Front. A big minus because there are only two scenarios. There should be a scenario about the actual backhand blow.

It's hard to defend as the Germans, but even harder for the Russians to complete the historic drive south-west.  The chit system makes for just-unpredictable enough combat, and the variable movement system introduces a welcomed uncertainty while still having a measure of the possible movement.

RATING: 7
The game is pretty tense for both sides, and has some interesting mechanics, a low learning curve, and good replayability.  However, there was also a lot of so so stuff.

I like the concept of the chit pull system in battles but felt it was not well executed here.  Most attacks are (by necessity) at such high odds, the changes from chits are not usually very important.  It adds a step for not much game play benefit.

I don't like that in many cases you have to surround a unit to be sure to do any damage (especially mobile units that can avoid two hits by retreating two hexes).  The game becomes a long series of tiny encirclements.  Otherwise, you have to attack at the ludicrously high odds I mentioned earlier to get the same result.

There is an administrative movement system intended to allow accumulation of combat power behind the lines allowing for surprise offensives or counter attacks.  I like the concept;  in most other wargames you can see where troops are massing behind the lines and respond in advance.  However, the system used here just feels like you are teleporting formations around.

A excellent operational view of the soviet onslaught toward Kiev  after the triumph of Stalingrad, and the famous counter-attack by marshall Von Manstein, inflicting heavy losses on the Red Army.This game amphises very well the superiority of the armour on foot slogger on a clear hex, using the clever tactic chits, which are randomly selected according the troops quality. It adds a pleasant uncertainty to the combats. The only negative point is that the sudden death conditions make it hard to play the game to the finish.

A really beautiful game, both components and map-wise with a great combat and C3I system. I had only played it solitaire, but after one FTF play I loved thiseven more. Great game play tension, and the proficiency of the units involved makes you feel the difference between the two armies. The administrative move rule allows you to reinforce success, or prop up a threatened wing that's about to be overrun. I'm hoping that the system is used in another game on the Eastern or Western front, it's that good. If you haven't played this, you should, you'll thank me.

Limited play thus far.  Very intriguing system.  It's simple, but not as easy to pick up as the marketing suggests.  May not mimic history, but it's a fast-playing beauty of a game.  Should be good for entry-level gamers intrigued by the Eastern Front and who are ready for something more "wargame-ish" than block or Euro-hybrid games.  Well suited to solitaire play.

RATING: 8
A gem of a wargame. Pros include:

-The rules are both simple and clear making it really easy to pick up(a rarity in wargames!). 

-Both sides have a victory point "deadline" that they need to reach each turn or automatically lose which keeps things very exciting from beginning to end. 

-Due to the low counter density and difficulty of head on attacks there is an emphasis on maneuver which I really enjoy. 

The biggest problems with the game would be that it takes a long time if it runs all the way till the end without a sudden death victory (unlikely) and that there is really only one scenario (there is a second one but its just the first one with less turns) but despite this I keep coming back to it over and over again so it can't be a too big a deal.

There is also some irrelevant but annoyingly bone headed counter errata.

RATING: N/A
No actual plays yet (just a couple of solo run-throughs), but I do really want to play this now!

Hmm, static setup, basically one scenario (two if you count the one where you quit early; I'm not sure I do).  Combat seems to be pretty horrible for the attacker, which encourages maneuver to cut the enemy's supply, which is cool.  I'm not really a fan of the split rulebooks; they might be a benefit if I had other games in the series, but I don't, so having two places to look for rules is an impediment.

I don't like the divisional integrity rules in America Triumphant because they require you to repeatedly stare at microscopic numbers on multiple 1/2" chits; I think that sort of thing is handled better in this game, where you can identify formations by their color.  (You still have to check the rules, though, to see whether this is one of the formations where you need three units instead of two, though--I don't appreciate that.)

RATING: 7
While not my favorite simulation of this battle, VMBB is both fun and playable.  As noted by many others, the Schwerpunkt/T3 system has its pros and cons.  I like the combat chits as they add a second level of strategy to battles.  The same holds for the schwerpunkt segments where you can move and fight key units using extra resources.  These two game features do, however, slow the game a bit though and add quite a lot of uncertainty to both movement and combat.  The much discussed ZOC rules play out reasonably except for movement.  The inability to back out of a salient can result in most of the game's mobile forces being locked into a single yin yang spiral somewhere.  The only way out is to slug it out until attrition opens the map up a bit.  Ugh.  That's about the only rule I'd change though.  The suddden death victory conditions politely push the Russians to do realistically dumb things at the operational level, but can make the game duration rather erratic.  This is not a big issue when playing solitare, but might be grim if you've worked to set up a face-to-face game.

The components are nice and the player aids (cards, weakened substitute counters instead of hit markers) are first rate.  Set up speed is the fastest of any game of this class.  It beats even the usual GMT approach.

RATING: 7
Tennis the von Manstein way!  The Schwerpunkt system is very clever and incorporates many of the essential features of operational warfare (supply, c3i, attached assets such as artillery or air power) with a minimum of overhead.

Unfortunately, the basic system is not well served here by the scenario.  This is a game where the eponymous "backand blow" is unlikely to happen because the Soviets do not have enough incentive to over-extend themselves as they did historically.  Additionally the sudden death victory conditions are such that the game is seldom likely to go the whole distance.

Not awful but Velikye Luki is much better.

A top notch wargame. Love the simplicity and clarity of the rules (one of the rare wargames where you dont have to scour the internet for rules answers). The schwerpunkt and general segments are a really clever way to model control and i love how elegantly the logistical problems of the russians in respect to the germans is modelled. The tight instant victory cutoffs make the game very intense from turn one.

My complaints are the mistakes on the counters for turn entry (but its not as big a deal as it may sound, dont let it stop you buying it) and the lack of scenarios. Only two scenarios are provided and theyre both basically the same, it would have been great to get a third one, perhaps dealing with the backhand blow itself.

Hope to see some more games in the Schwerpunkt series one of these days!

A very interesting system that takes a few turns to get your head wrapped around how the turn sequence works.  Once you do, however, it is a much different take on East Front warfare than seen in most games.  I can see where some gamers might complain about the combat system taking a bit longer, but I found it to be unpredictable and you need to respond to ever changing tactical situations.  Overall, it's a much better than average operational level game.

A few comments after having played the first four turns of the campaign - which ended in a Soviet victory after the liberation of Dnepropetrovsk:

The game system is not complex: The two rule books are very manageable and there were few instances where we had to search for a specific rule.

The game play is tense and there are several interesting decisions to make each turn. As usual on the Eastern Front, the German player cannot afford any mistake. [For instance, my opponent kept its GD Division in first line and... lost it almost entirely!]

Can the German player win? I believe he can avoid losing early, but this requires very good play and some luck in support drawing & combat DR...

Personally, I think supply is a little bit too "easy": I would have preferred a classic system: "X hexes to a road connected to a supply source", instead of being in supply virtually everywhere if you are not encircled...

Also, there is no rule for the Dnepr River, which should be impassable everywhere, except at bridges - But it can easily be added if both players agree...

Sold because the game system has been abandoned and because I believed I could find another game on the subject with better historicity...

Very interesting system especially the Administrative Movement and combat chit / tactical factors components.  With no ability to infiltrate ZOC's, though, line can become very static after the initial thin Axis line.  Some folks at ConsimWorld have been criticizing the use of rigid ZOCs in VMBB, which results in a fairly static game when the German line stabilizes. I've asked if anyone has tried it with modified ZOC rules, e.g., motorized to non-motorized ZOC move OK at full movement allowance, with no response. I suspect that it might entirely destabilize the game, but I am curious to try it....  But not that curious.  Traded.

After having tried this out at least 5-6 times, I think it's time I abandon it...

It's a decent game with a good system (the chits add some nice flavor / variability), but the victory conditions leave the "sudden death" door open far too wide as it is far to easy for one side to lose the game via Sudden Death due to 1-2 turns of bad dice (1-2 turns only covers 6 days at most which seems far too short to have the campaign declared a loss).

Component wise : rules, map, and counters are all well done and have seemingly avoided much in the way of errata.  And there are literally tons of player aids (7-8 or something like that) that help keep things visually referenced.

Lastly - good luck getting the "backhand blow" as I'm not sure there's anything in the game that really pushes you to the position where you'll see it happen (you will see the Germans gain a tactical and operational advantage though, just nothing as sweeping as happened).

Unfortunately. GMT only published this one as series Schwerpunkt. The T3-based system that was developed by Dirk Blennemann inside Moments in History, is one of the best that have ever been designed for the Eastern front. Each turn is divided into subsections called Schwerpunkt segments that alternate between the two players but always with the initiative on the Russian side. The tactical value of the counters and their influence in combat is sometimes more decisive than combat capability itself. The number of available actions in Schwerpunkt segments depends on C3 points available. Random events and a SNAFU, cause when a player thinks he has the situation under control, that everything will come down and take a 180 degree turn on stage. The Russian player must fight their slowness and the need to divide his action points between two fronts, while German will endure as possible the arrival of reinforcements or be lost. In my opinion, this is a game that if the Russian does not win in the first 7 turns, he is doomed, because thereafter, the German player receives many more points C3, reinforcements and replacements. The system tends to a draw. If you like the Eastern front and do not have this game, do not hesitate a moment and grab a copy.

RATING: 5.5
Things I like:
* The first four or five turns are very exciting - can the Germans hold out?
* Every-turn "sudden death" victory conditions are always good.
* Administrative Movement is a great way to handle "strategic movement"; more games should use this.
* Nice counters, map and player aids.
* Small enough to fit on one table and in one counter tray.

Things that are so-so:
* The chit system - I like the fact that the player doesn't have to explicitly allocate air, artillery, etc. but the chits are too small to be comprehensive, so I printed the info onto stickers for old playing cards.  There are some interesting choices to make, but I wouldn't say it gives a "tactical feel".
* Counting step losses for VP - I tend to forget :*)
* The activation system - games move faster when you can't move all your units every turn, but there's no way to defend a line, it's all "point defense".
* Supply rules - it's easy to determine supply because the only way you are out of it is if you are surrounded (called a Concentric Attack in the game), but there's no incentive to break through to the enemy rear since you can't affect supply from there. (Well, you can mess w/the Soviet Fronts some.)

Things I don't like:
* ZOC rules - you can't move from ZOC to ZOC, so two units on opposite sides can trap any stack.  Also, friendly units don't negate enemy ZOC's for movement or retreat, so the only way out is to attack...
* Activation costs - ...and each attack has the same cost, whether two or twenty units are involved. So part of the game is to make your opponent attack his way out of ZOC traps, thus giving him fewer units to move, which means you have more stationary targets to trap... can you say "vicious circle"?  Large attacks are much more efficient and are more likely to cause casualties...
* Victory conditions - ...which are the main source of VPs.  (There are only six cities that give VP.)  As others have said, there's no reason for the Russian to be aggressive.
* Two rulebooks - too confusing, especially for combat resolution sequence (I needed to write up an aid for that).

I may play this again in a couple years, but I won't miss it much.

Easy to Learn but Difficult to master,
Beautiful game on Kharkov Subject, it will be difficult to repeat the true Backhand Blow because soviet Player will be more cautios than historical counterpart.Seems that the soviet can win only in the first three turn otherwise he will be doomed.Despite this little balance problem a good game 
This one however is a good game with many good ideas, like draws chit during combat and command points activation.

Didn't like the T3 system at all. Took all the fun OUT of the player's hands IMO.

Nice game. Plays very smoothly. The rulebook might seem intimidating, but the game can easily be taught in 15 minutes. The chit drawing becomes somewhat tedious in the long run.

Interesting system but you never get to have a backhand blow!

A perfect wargame to begin with.  The rules are easy enough, the C3i point idea works very well, and those chit draws add a lot of fun.  Basicly, it's a FUN wargame with minimal fuss.  I REALLY like this one, go and buy it!

I finally sat down and played a short solo run of this game.  My initial issue with this game was the two rulebooks.  I understand wanting to keep a set of basic rules for a game series, but dividing the rulebook was unnecessary and confusing.
The game mechanics are tight, but the chit-pull system tends to slow battles down, and requiring a greater than 3 to 1 advantage during an attack seems like a cheap way to make the Russian artificially difficult.  I don't believe that these issues are enough to drive anyone who enjoys Eastern Front wargames away, however.

I wanted to find a simple operational game about WW2 on the eastern front. This is the one to get, the game system is excellent, with a good tactical feeling without complexity. The chit system is brillant, troop quality often makes the difference even against the odds.

Both sides must be played carefullly as both have good hitting power and big weaknesses.

Very good design. C3i points, tactics chit, fluid interaction between players, all add to the pleasure of playing this game.
But the system punishes mistakes very hard & the at start situation combined to the sudden death conditions make it very difficult for the Germans to reach the turns when counterattacking becomes possible.
My feeling is that Sudden Death should be replaced by a system with VP penalties which would make easier for the game to continue beyond turn 7.
I would rate the system higher than the game, especially now that experience teached me that there are not many strategies possible & that the game lacks replayability.

Very good mechanics, but the game is badly bugged with its victory conditions. Sudden death is unevitable with german player if the russian one does his job. Playtested ?

An innovative system a bit spoiled by the use of rigid zoc.The sudden death conditions don't work as intended.

Solid hex and counter, with some twists. Use of combat chits I found somewhat confusing, but otherwise a very clean rule set. Crisp graphics, not much to complain about.

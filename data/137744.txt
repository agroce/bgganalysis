Fast play but without the cute themeing of something like sushi go. And only plays two, so it doesn't get many outings.

Kickstarted

Man am I terrible at this game. I have a hard time paying attention to what I'm doing and what my opponent is doing at the same time. 

The winning strategy seems to be to attack as often as possible making your opponent defend.

A favorite of my wife's, we've played many games (I've not won one yet) moves very quickly, like Speed, but with more strategic choices.  We received our Tessen Classic copy very quickly and eagerly await the upcoming full release.

My daughter loves playing this one, and I will play it with her; but I do find the game too simple for me and I'm not the biggest fan of speed games. (With the exception of escape and space cadets).  I will play this with my daughters though!!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Speed game with a few tweaks. It works fine but I'll stick with Jungle Speed. (Outside of speed, the two games are not similar in the least bit).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Keeping this for now to play with my nephew, and as a quick travel game. Not sure about the longevity, but a good set collection game at first blush. Definitely better if you play with someone who is about the same speed as you since it's a real time game of laying down cards and slapping down warrior cards to steal/defend against having some of your animal cards taken.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Trick taking game with the real time aspect added on to try to make it interesting.  Not a very interesting game and the real time aspect isn't a very good fix for its lack of depth or fun.

This one was fun! Great artwork, plays really well. Only reason for a 6 rating is because I'm not always in the mood for real-time card games - if you are, I'm sure you'll love this game. Happy to have it in my collection!

Bumped to a 7. This one is growing on me.

A fantastic, refreshingly innovative real-time card game. Beautiful artwork, especially for the prototype version I played. Avoids a lot of the pitfalls I've seen with other real-time card games. Plays smoothly and elegantly. Will definitely pick this one up when it becomes available.

Tessen is an elegantly designed two player real time set collecting game. Players try to collect sets of animals and can use warriors to attack the other player's sets or defend their own. A game is typically a three out of five match with a simple but effective catchup mechanism to keep matches tense throughout.

Like most real time non-digital games, timing ambiguities come up occasionally. In my experience, this is especially true after an attack, when the action stops and each player can come up with a plan to execute immediately afterwards.

Lopsided rounds based on luck are also possible. If one player starts with a lot of warriors and the other none, the player with warriors can attack the other player, who is defenseless, and that player's stacks will all become clogged with warriors. That player can then do nothing except discard cards until she finds warriors to clear out her play area, giving the first player freedom to collect as many sets as possible.

All in all, a very fun, action packed game. Oh yeah, and the art is great :)

Fun Fast Simple Real-Time Hand-Management Set-Collection 2-Player Card Game in a Beautiful Feudal Japanese Setting. Wonderful art and graphic design. Easy to learn, teach, and play.

Play this with 5 rounds. It goes fast. Also consider sleeving these cards.

Family Game. Beer-N-Pretzels Game. Dexterity Game. Portable.

This scratches my itch for the card game Jab. I enjoy this theme better.

"Clever, simple real-time 2p duel. Definitely not my kind of game."

What I like:
- Pretty straightforward
- Real-time works well
- Turn-based variant also works (apparently)
- Each round only takes a few minutes

What I don't like:
- I'm not a fan of duels, nor real-time games

Got the original art version, AND the new one.  Played several times at a bar.  Good casual game between beers.

New art version is a bit easier visually, but I prefer the original.

Very quick (real time) 2P only card game.  It's a simultaneous set collection game where you can 'steal' cards from your opponent to complete your sets.  Of course they can block your steal, and then you can re-steal...this back and forth (at a furious pace) is a big part of the game and surprisingly engaging.

Solid Speed variant, with animals! Great to play with kids but not a lot of decisions to make for adults. Still fun with the animals and ninjas flying all over.

The best real-time light 2-player card game I've played, although that's a small field. Attempt to create sets of animals in 3+ cards so you can score them (but with limited slots some cards aren't useful), use warriors to steal cards from the other player and block a slot unless they can immediately defend.

Plays super fast, quite interesting for the lightness.

RATING: 8.5
A real-time, take-that, set collection card game that I really enjoyed!  The short play time makes it perfect to carry around in your bag and play whenever you have 15 minutes to kill. The more I play it, the more I love it!

Own both classic and second edition. Classic is harder because the artwork all looks very similar, so it's hard to match from across the table.

Fast, fun to play.  Great quick game.  I liked the classic artwork better, but it is easier to see what is going on with the new graphics.  Sending a warrior off to the shogun after each round is a great way to balance the game - every round you win you are down another warrior.  Its a clever way to keep score as well.

Two-player real time set collection card game. Race to the bottom of your deck and score the most points from your collected sets. This reminds me a lot of the live action card game Speed that was very popular with my cousins and I as kids in our own king of the mountain challenge tournaments. Needless to say, I like this game already just for the sentimentality. This variant kicks it up a lot with separate tableaus that can be stolen from by playing Samurai cards.  Love it. The only problem is the price point? Is it worth that much for two decks of cards?

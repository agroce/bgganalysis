Sounds pretty awesome.  I don't have a lot of use for solo games, but something thematic like this sounds like it'd be a nice use of time.

Participated in the Playtesting process. Amazing experience. Great game design and very fun game to play over and over and over....

Perfect example of "easy to learn, hard to master" type of game.

Stage of siege game from VPG, your castle is surrounding by an ever approaching horde of beasts and monsters and you need to push them back, minimal production (feels like print and play) has kept me away from this game (shame on me) which is very rewarding at times and passes its theme of siege very well to the player.

This should click with me but didn't for some reason. Maybe because it feels more like tower defense than the rest of the SoS games...and I don't enjoy tower defense games.

mind the morale, time it's use to the max. Mind the defenders loss (else decreased number of attacks). Use as many spells as possible. About quests, forgo all, unless they allow time tracker advancement.

One play, and I like it! Typical states of siege game, where you aim to keep the invading creatures (tracks) back from your castle. But they are relentless and you have to play your actions (including spells in this one) to repel them as best you can. Pray for lucky dice rolls! Looking forward to exploring with the other heroes, and adding the expansion when I've explored the base set thoroughly.

overpriced considering the shoddy print and play component and lack of replay value.. other than that it got nice state-of-siege game system.. but the overall package is unbearable

I just got this game in the mail this past weekend (in Feb 2012). This is a new type of game for me (solitaire, "States of Siege") and my first game from the publisher Victory Point Games. I really enjoy this game! The balance is good, I found the first scenario a little easy - I won 2 out of 3. The second scenario is a little more difficult and I have won 1 out of 2. The loss was very exciting because it was very close and it came down to the final time slot!! I feel like there is some decent replay value here, especially if more scenarios and event cards are added. I will *definitely* be picking up more of these solitaire games from VPG, especially if the price point is a little lower (many of them sell for $14.95).
2/29/12 - note my last 2 games vs greenskin scenario #1 have ended in decisive losses! I must have been lucky on my previous wins :)

It's difficult to rate games like this using the BGG system.  I might not play often enough for it to be a very high rating, but it's a GREAT little solitaire game which sold me on the States of Siege series.  After playing this game I immediately bought Dawn of the Zeds and preordered GMT's Revolt and Revolution.

Fun defend-the-castle-against-hordes-of-monsters solo game, designed by Chris Taylor of Fallout fame. I like this game a lot - it's full of interesting choices (should I create acid trap or cast spell to boost morale?) that really make you feel like defenders against the horde that's coming every which way. I can see myself playing this little game for years to come.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game, the state of siege system really translates very well to the fantasy realm.  I found the game challenging as usual, have no doubt that it plays very much like other state of siege games.  BUT, The added flavor of randomize monsters and heroes and spells really adds to the replayability.  

I rather like the new victory condition of the game, instead of going through the whole deck of cards like the rest of the SoS series, you have to survive several turns and hence you don't get through all the cards every game and I think this also adds to the replay value.

If I have any complaints, it is that I wish the game came with more scenarios and monsters.  It comes with 2 scenarios and 2 basic sets of monsters: Goblinkin & Undead of 30 or so counters.  It wouldn't have taken much to create more options to the player in the base set.  

I am sure there will be expansions to rectify this but that will also add to the cost of the game.  But I guess wanting more from a game is usually a good sign that the game is good.

This game does suffer from lack of historicity, I found the flavor text on the cards not as interesting as the other SoS games and this leads to a sort of emptiness in me during play.  But for someone that loves fantasy theme and want to play a solitaire, this is a highly recommended game.

This is a fun solitaire game with plenty of claustrophobia as the enemies close in.  There is a substantial element of chance, as to be expected, but there are some tough decisions to be made of when to take the riskier option.  Having two sets of enemies and many different combinations of heroes gives a respectable amount of replayability for such a compact game.

Some praise for Victory Point Games: I had an old copy of the base game and a newer copy of the expansion, and the cards were not compatible at all (without sleeving).  They sent me a whole new set of the base game cards free.  I have happily continued to buy several of their games.

Fun game, lighter than the other Victory Point Games solitaire games (We Must Tell the Emperor and Zulus on the Ramparts, the two that I own). Good theme, but doesn't capture my imagination. The expansion adds a lot, though, and is highly recommended.

Fun defend your castle solo game. Plays pretty quickly once you've got the rules down and leads to some fun nail biter moments hoping the next card you turn over doesn't send baddies crashing through the front gates.

Playable Solo, after a video review, it's probably one of the only state of siege game I have seen that makes sense, and it's probably the non-historical aspect of the game that makes it possible.

It's a defend your castle type of game. Still, I'll have to check out if the game is really random or if there are really meaningful decisions to take.

Has some similarities with defenders of the realm, but it plays solitaire.

Read the rules in diagonal, it seems OK for a small solitaire game. You basically try to spend actions and use all your tools to push back the enemy and try to survive until reinforcement arrives. The only frustration is that the enemies cannot die.

RATING: 6.5
I have played this game solo more than any other game solo. It takes just the right amount of time and setup. Each turn is spaced nicely and you allocate your action points to the things you need to deal with the most. There are a few spells that mix things up a bit, too.

It is still Amerithrash, so you tend to roll and fail a lot, but there are lots of bonuses that, if used correctly and you pace  yourself well, give you a great chance that you'll make it through. I usually win my plays, so it is a forgiving sort of game.

First play was OK, but I didn't play it right which made the game far too easy.  It's a straight up solo affair that is short enough to insure I'll work through it several more times.  Seems to me to be a keeper.  I did laminate the board and player reference sheet, sleeve the game cards and replace the die due to component play-ability and longevity concerns.

I liked Ottoman Sunset but wanted more choices.  Legions offers more choices, but at the cost of lots of little rules scattered all over the place.  The game can still end ridiculously fast if you are unlucky, and you still have very little overall control over luck of dice or cards.  While many of the added rules offer more choice in theory, in practice you have little to inform you about what choice is best, other than obviously going for the nearest threat or hoping you are dealing with what the next card will advance.  The extra rules add some depth, but mostly that depth is swallowed by the randomness.

Also, like most generic fantasy games, the fantasy is just so...generic.  Part of the appeal of Ottoman Sunset was the thematically rich history that justified and added charm to the tall odds, random events, and special case rules.  Generic fantasy doesn't have the richness, and seems even more prone to lots of little special cases even than historical simulations do.

Update:  If, like me, you want Ottoman Sunset with more rules and more choices, play the 2nd edition with all the variants added.

The only negative I have out of the bag is that the map is too small; for a grand siege such as this, an 11 x 17 map would convey a much better feel (the 8.5 x 11 maps are just fine for the intro SoS games, Israeli Independence and A Blood Red Banner).

Not my cup of tea, sorry.

VPG is still keeping the State of Siege series fresh.  More meaningful decisions than Runebound offers.  After 2 plays though, it does not seem as deadly as some of the others in the series.

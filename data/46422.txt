Nostra City has some nice thematic ideas and some very nice artwork, but as a game it just falls apart.  

Central to the game is the trial of your mob's boss.  If he is found guilty, all loyal players will lose.  An FBI snitch needs the boss to be found guilty.  The jury is influenced by bribes, placed face down.  

There's a problem here that we've previously seen with Android and its guilty/innocent chits played face down. There is insufficient information to do anything more nuanced than piling in or gambling that the right result will somehow turn up. Nostra City tries to rectify that with a mid-game peek at the bribes, but that - and everybody loses being a better result than an opponent winning - just means that the serious bribery happens later on.
 
There is another problem. The game introduces a "traitor" element (the FBI snitches). Unlike Shadows Over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica, the timing of your discovery that you are a snitch (and whether you have a fellow snitch) is down to random draws from the Vendetta deck. This can lead to a very unbalanced game. A player who draws the only snitch on the last turn is quite probably screwed. In the three player game, a solitary loyal mobster against two early snitches is also very likely screwed.  Of course, the snitches make our first problem still worse; Giuseppe may be giving generously to the jury, but you've no way of knowing whose side he is on.

The rest of Nostra City might almost be a classical efficiency game in which you first work to build up income and then switch to scoring victory points.   Vendetta cards can effectively derail your engine and so in our last game we tried to avoid giving reasons to draw them.  That made the game less chaotic, but also rather dry and dull. Almost blind bidding (you know how many bills a player has bid but not their values or what for) in auctions for new cards adds yet another layer of chaos.

I don't know quite what to make of this.  I really am drawn to it.  I think it has a lot of neat ideas.  I really like the hidden element the snitch provides.  However, I have a major issue with the rules.  When cashing in, the rules say you decide whether to cheat an opponent after having looked at the bills drawn.  This provides little incentive to cheat other players, as you can just stick them with the crappiest bill (often times a measly $5,000).  This, in turn, virtually breaks the game, since it becomes a predictable race to respect points without the threat of a snitch via the Vendetta cards. Half-way through our first game, we house-ruled that you could not look at the bills before deciding whether to cheat others during cash-in.  With this change, the game became quite interesting.  We still ended up all losing, with no snitch and a guilty verdict, despite a plethora of Vendetta cards being doled out after the house rule was implemented.

Bribing the jury weakens your position towards the other players, since you lose money without getting a benefit that doesn't also benefit every other player. Thus, no one bribes the jury. And thus, the game just doesn't work.

Good game, but the key mechanic doesn't work.

Nostra City is one of the better Mafia themed games I have played and somewhat underrated, but I'm still looking for my Mafia grail game. Nostra City has some good ideas, is easy to play and features plenty of take that game play which I like, but the balance seems a little off in places.  Overall, Nostra City is a good game, but I would probably choose to play other games over it which makes it hard to get to the table.

Really nice theme where you are trying to influence the outcome of the mob boss trial. 

Some of the cards are a little overpowered such as the give away one of your rackets to take two of another players. This can lead to shutting somebody out of the game if played early.

'screwing' other players as a viable mechanic (they draw a revenge card) is a nice and interestingly different mechanic not seen in a lot of games. 

Needs more than 3 players.

I had a hard time finding this game, but had read good things about it, and was persistent.

This is a low key partnership card game.  The end conditions have some similarities to Shadows over Camelot.  If someone turns into a snitch, and the Godfather is found guilty, the snitch wins.  If the Godfather is found not guilty, then the lieutenant with the most respect wins.  If the Godfather is found guilty and there is no snitch, no one wins. The Godfather starts out guilty, but the jury can be corrupted if the lieutenants work together.  

It's very thematic: payouts, contracts, respect, FBI & IRS investigations, NYPD raids, turfs, cheating, revenge, snitches, bribes--all in a game that is supposed to last an hour (both games lasted longer for us).

Some of the complex rules and examples are confusing.  One icon on the cards is not addressed at all in the rule book.  Several rules could have easily and simply been added to the game board or the card--for example, respect gained is indicated on the cards, except for dual turf cards, & you have to remember they give 1 respect.  Player aids would have been helpful.  

There is a lot of luck in the beginning deal.  It is easy to immediately fall behind in the first & second rounds (6 rounds total), and very difficult to catch up.

After a couple of games, I am undecided.  Need to play again with more than 3. And the game really needs player aids before it is played again.

Pardon me? 24 pages of rules for a game of bidding & bluffing?  And has anyone actually playtested this?  A bidding game where you randomly draw the money and the money notes go from $5.000 to $50.000?  No thanks, never again.

RATING: 7
It seems to be an interesting 'blind' bidding game with a couple different bidding points.  First you need to allocate income (or give people vendettas which may be worse then just giving them the money) and then you blind bid on things to help you build for future turns and points and then you blind bid on actually winning or losing the game.

I've given it a 7 because I feel there's a game here worth exploring even though we had a 'rough' first game. But, I think it had a lot to do with trying to play a game that was NEW to everyone at something like 2 am after about 8 hours of gaming.

Semi-cooperative with a possible traiter.
The Designer wanted way too much..:

Traitor mechanic, Semi-cooperativ, bidding, worker placement with special powers & economics.

- If you do something for the group, you will slim your chance of winning the game.
- You can play as good as you want, in the end everyone has some overpowered Vendetta Cards that will swing the outcome completely.

The Theme is cool & under all the debris is a good game.. but playing it as it is, is no fun at all.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (February 2016)

When I was reading the rules of Nostra City, I realized this game wasn’t for me. Still it was in my list of “new games to play” this month so I played it :D.

The rules are easy to learn and teach, however reading them from the rulebook isn’t as easy as it should be. I’m not sure why, perhaps they could be a lot clearer or I was tired the night I read them. 

The box design is different. It resembles a book. I’m indifferent to it.

Nostra City drips theme all over the place. The decisions aren’t that obvious, you need to plan carefully who to betray and when. Which card to bid on and perhaps convince your “family” to let you have it. It has lots of trash talking and negotiation. I like this part a lot!

The idea behind the game is to corrupt the jury so they find innocent the Don while at the same time you gain respect from many cards. I love that there is a possible snitch among us trying to bribe the jury as well, but looking for a conviction! In general I really like the idea of the vendetta cards. The only thing I dislike about them is that they seem very powerful, so you (almost) never want to betray someone, or else, they draw more Vendetta cards. Nostra City thrives on “take that” and betrayal, so, if this is your cup of tea, you should like it.

I’m worried about the snitch system. A player become a snitch not by choice, but by drawing random cards and that can happen in any phase of the game, so it is pure luck if you are a snitch or not, that means you can never plan for it.

Some players can get angry over the game, for the same reason it is very group dependent. You need some backstabbing friends for it to shine.

Bottom line, I’m surprised by the game, it is a cool mafia game and more enjoyable that I initially thought. As I wrote before this is not my kind of game, but it is one of the best of its kind I have played and it was fun to play, perhaps it is an underrated game. I already sold my copy of the game, but if someone request a play I will play happily. It is a blast with the correct game group.

Only played one game, at the start it was fun, lots of choice and mechanics that reminded me of Battlestar Galactica. As the game advances, the choice were obvious and the game was way too random to make choice that did really matter anyways.

This is a really clever, suspenseful little game. It blends elements of worker-placement, auction, and Werewolf-style hidden ID games into an imaginative story about a branch of the Cosa Nostra at the crossroads as they wait for the end of their Godfather's trial. Art is spotty but mostly quite fun and thematically pertinent, and there's lots of opportunity for fun table talk. 

My only very mild criticism is that there are relatively few chances to earn Respect points, given that there are essentially (with one important proviso) how you win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
If vendetta cards are not drawn then no one can become the snitch which is a problem since worrying about who might be a snitch is half the fun of the game.

Next time I'm going to do a variant in which each player is given a Vendetta card at game start and there is a 50% chance one of the players starts the game as a snitch.

Карточная игра. Довольно неплох выдержан антураж гангстерский. Есть некоторые места слабые, например, стать помощником ФБР на предпоследнем ходу, когда попытаться выиграть уже маловероятно. Некоторые фазы хода на последнем ходу могут оказаться бессмысленными. Некоторые элементы игры как бы не очень хорошо взаимосвязаны между собой, т.е. сбор денег и найм\захват. Нет как бы целостности в действиях, они как бы локализованы друг от друга. Но в целом ощущения хорошие, есть азарт и напряжение. Пойдет как игра для компании, вероятно, лучше играть 5ром.

Of course, I expect no less from a mafia game and I think many will enjoy this more than me.

Neat bluffing/backstabbing game about mobsters trying to bail out their boss while fighting for survival and the upper hand in the ranks.

An experience game with a somewhat fragile framework that includes some good mechanic ideas.  In the wrong group, unwilling to generate conflict, it could be quite dull.  There is a division of spoils by blind preplotted bid that can be either catastrophic or nuanced, depending on the amount of negotiation beforehand.  I wager that if anyone at the table is "happy" with you at the end of the game, you've played badly.

This game is remarkably more enjoyable than it has any right to be.  

Let's look at everything that is awful about this game.

*Random auction draws that can make player growth and possibility of catching up impossible.
*Blind auctions so you don't know what other people are bidding on.
*Blind bidding on auctions where you lose your money.  
*Economic engine that encourages a runaway leader.
*Extreme "Take That" mechanism designed to keep the leader in check, so everyone should gang up to stop the leader if you want it to be self balancing.
*Extreme blind denomination rewards: values of 5-50
*Event cards that take away fun powers, leaving a cold dry random lottery.
*Encourages negotiation that makes the game more clinical and shallow.

The biggest failure to me is the snitch system.  The fact that you could randomly turn into a snitch at the last minute is bunk.  You aren't encouraged to save the dude, because you can use the cards to make points, but if you sacrifice them to save him, you could switch to wanting him to fail at anytime.  If you know you are a snitch early on it is VERY easy to blow his ass up.  Of course you can't be a snitch unless someone screws you, so as long as no one messes with anyone then the game will be balanced (but that isn't really that fun).  Plus, you would think that I would be more pissed off if people played vendetta cards on me destroying my infrastructure than someone shortchanging me. Thematically, why would I not get a vendetta card if my right hand man is whacked?

With all of these elements stacked up against it, it holds together pretty well.  The art is nice and it does give you something of a sense of place.

But, without the players acting the part, there isn't a lot of joy here.  Rather it is just a game of point accumulation, grinding along with nothing particularly clever to do.

This looks promising, but I didn't realize that it was all in German when I bought it. No problem for me, but I'll need to get around to making some paste-ups before I can actually play it with anyone I know.

Played once with 4 players. I didn't like the game. First of all I tried to get one character with the bid and didn't get it because someone had a super card and a 50 thousand dollar bill to use (I did spend 70k but didn't get that character - I guess I didn't have the luck I needed)
After that I had no money and a Vendetta card that I could use to eliminate a wise guy but paying 20k!
Without money and without any luck in getting new cards from the bids (no prestige cards, no new location cards to increase my income, nothing) I was out of the game soon enough to play it simple.

Overall, I didn't have any chance of winning the game. I didn't get any really useful vendetta cards, no prestige cards and no traitor card. The only time I got lucky was once when I've drawn 3 cards from my single income card (a location card that I had from the beginning) but immediately after that and against all odds (simply because I was no menace to anybody) another player played a vendetta card on me and took all my money! 

So, I won't rate this game for now but only because I don't want my rate to have too much weight on the game. I don't like it, I will never (ever) play this game again and for me this is probably the worst game I've played this year. 

It has a fun theme and I like the artwork a lot.

A tense game about betrayal, confusion, violence and chaos control. There are a couple of subtle strategies in here that, when utilized properly, could give you the win;

Careful restriction of vendetta cards, timing when you whack the other players wiseguys, how much you commit to the auctions and utilization of the wiseguys abilities is key.

One play, Essen 2009. Well, it was late, and we were all tired.  But the game did seem overly complex, and reluctant to yield up the fun of its theme until the rules had been digested.  Actually, the mobster theme is one of my least favourite, so perhaps I'd miss the point even then.

I so wanted this to be better than it was, but it is still pretty good. I like the risk/reward of cheating people out of their earnings, and the possibility of the secret traitor, but this one lacks that one little extra push to make it great.

Recommend it if you like mobster themed games or you can pick it up on the cheap.

Very good co-operative competitive traitor game with a sort of worker placement, screwage when dividing loot, light negotiation, blind bid auctions, "take that" cards, and secret trial influence actions. Initially, everybody needs to work together to get the Godfather cleared in his trial, but at the same compete for the most respect to win the game; and during the game one or two players may secretly become FBI snitches secretly trying to get the Godfather convicted, but at the same time competing for the most respect to win the game. Tough choices between using your few wiseguys selfishly or co-operatively to earn money from your existing turfs; to try to recruit new wiseguys and take control of new turfs; or to bribe jurors/witnesses to affect the trial.

Is a variant of Battle Line/Schotten Totten, with cute artwork. Plays quickly and fits in my pocket. Fantastically simple game to teach but has a lot of tough choices for a mini game.

Really solid two player area control game.  Doesn't do anything explicitly amazing, but some clever mechanisms and fills a proper niche.

Basically, Omen: A Reign Of War without special powers on the cards. I didn't know that was a good idea! Turns out yes.

(Area control battles at several spots laid out horizontally on the table; each turn you choose a balance between drawing cards and playing them; some cards in your hand can be played for advantage or kept for points; players have shared control over when each battle is resolved and manipulating that is key to winning.)

This game is great. It takes less than 10 minutes to play. There is a lot of strategy to consider with several difficult meaningful decisions.

RATING: 7
This compact 2-player card game is a satisfyingly strategic experience that lasts as long as it should.  I was surprised by ORC, I didn't expect it to be this good.  It is somewhat in the tradition of a lighter Schotten Totten (sans poker hand stuff).  At such a low price, great game for your dollar.

Fun tug of war with a tiny footprint.  I also like the tension of leaving cards in your hand to score otherwise the area majority doesn't matter.

A type of Battle Line, but simple and plays in a few minutes.  Not sure you can come back when you start to lose, although the hand scoring for matching cards you have conquered may do this.  The artwork is pretty good for a game that comes in a box the size of a chewing gum pack.

Okay game that feels like a relative of Battle Line. This one is very quick and dirty in comparison though. The rules are also written kind of oddly for this game, as I didn't realize that the number of Orcs pictures on each card mattered at first. This game is fine, but it's definitely the weakest of those in Pack-o-Game wave 2.

Cannot recommend it enough! Super light, breezy game. You know those long periods of time when you and your significant other spend in front of the TV without talking a word?
Well... break that monotony with this light game. 
You can easily multitask, and this wraps up in 5-10 mins!

2p Tug of war game to get the area control and score the most points in the colors. I can't say that like this type of game. I think the colors and the artwork is great but the overall game play is not my kind of play. I really don't like the tug of war type games. If you do then I think you should check this game out for sure. Small and very easy to teach.

There were only 2 games from the Pack-O-Games 2 that we decided to keep.  This was one.  It plays [i]super[/i] quick - in fact, it takes more time to setup than it takes to play.  Not a bad thing.

I'm not sure how much replay value is here, but it'll be a good game to play while waiting for food at a restaurant.

2 player area majority with no second place and random draws.  No special twists.  Win by being lucking in drawing the color you need when you need it.  It's tiny, it's functional, it's fast, and it's quite devoid of anything interesting.

I am not big on area control, but this game was fast. I liked the original cute orcs better than the final video game-ish orcs. I don't have many opportunities for two-player games, but I hope to play this more.

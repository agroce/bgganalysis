RATING: 4
1st play: Enjoyable tableau builder with a somewhat tired theme. The card actions are a little limited but the bits are top notch and lots of chained actions make you feel powerful. This plays well with 3 but I think 2 would be better since it's fairly solitaire. 

No second play.

Does not stand up to repeated plays for us. A little bit random. End up feeling lucky instead of skilled when the game gives you the cards that you need. Enjoy the chain building tile placement of this game.

RATING: 8
Very solid engine builder here where you are throwing down relics and spells to affect both other players and your own VP tally. I like the individual boards and how you can purchase up such different tiles to fuel what actions you can select later. Not as much of a 'magic school' feel as the amazing Argent: The Consortium, but it plays so differently that there is room for both in my collection.

RATING: 7
The combination of tile placement for action selection and chaining is interesting, and lends itself to some good, albeit simple, engine building. While very fun, the game starts to fall of towards the ending and feels like it needs something more. My rank would likely go up with a decent expansion.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's a light engine builder with a good amount of strategy, but the game is ruined by an excessive dependence on luck. Bad luck early game can ruin your chances of winning by preventing you from accessing good tiles. To make matters worse,  you will have to sit there and watch the runaway leader take long and complex turns while you can't do much with your weak board.

Fun, light-ish to middle-weight game I played at Gen Con. The theme and 'pop' of he components is generic, but the gameplay is very solid. There didn't seem to be anything that made this a standout for me: would absolutely play again, but wouldn't buy nor go out of my way to suggest.

RATING: 8
Played with a number of groups already. Exemplifies the idea that you don't need complexity or that sometimes simple is good. The rules are light and easy to learn, but the game is very engaging and there is a lot of room to maneuver. I've ended games as the winner with a full board full of tiles chaining off of each other. I've also won with only 3 tiles on my board. It's great.

This game is pretty awesome. The game play is super simple, but the way the tiles on the board work, allows us for a ton of depth. I will likely never turn down a chance to play this game.

RATING: 7
A missed opportunity. I really like the tile-laying and adjacency-activation mechanic, but the powers are so boring and limited that they don't offer many interesting decisions: gain a crystal, gain a will, activate a card, etc. Similarly, the bonuses gained from completing lessons could have done a lot more within this system, but unfortunately seemed a little bland and uninspired to me: gain three crystals, draw a card, etc. 

I'd love to see an expansion for this that added more icons and abilities (maybe even extra spell boards), providing an opportunity for more actions and more interesting combos. This could have been great. As it is, the game is just "okay."

Some cool twists present in the game, but overall the game itself just didn't feel that interesting to me. Building your personal grid is a simple puzzle, and should only be built to fuel victory - so it is not as if you have to plan carefully to fill every box. You only fill boxes to fuel your run. The two currency system is not particularly interesting in this game (get blue from actions, get reds from actions), and the cards remind me of Seaons: combo-able, but fairly simple effects that we have seen 100 times before in other games.

Interesting, fast playing engine game that... dunno, just didn't seem to do it for me. The components seemed underproduced, the luck all too present and not a lot of interaction to be had.

Exactly what I'm looking for in a light game:

-Engaging game play
-Quick play time
-Meaningful decisions

Makes you feel clever as you pull off big turns or combos.  Definitely see this getting a lot of play by me.

Update after 10 plays:  Still a solid 8 for me.  The game is more enjoyable now since I've learned the cards in the deck.  You start to get a feel for which cards combo well together.  Depending on the cards you want to build or strategy you want to pursue, you'll map out your tiles differently.  Definitely a keeper and excited to play it more.

Not necessarily a con for me since the game is light and plays so quickly, but may bother others - there is not much of a way to stop a runaway leader.  This game has some engine building in it, but no in your face direct interaction to stop people from steamrolling.  There are a few minor cards that can annoy your opponents and slow them down a step or two, but not enough to keep them from winning.  I have noticed as we've played more that you do need to watch what your opponents are doing and that will help prevent large victories.  If I notice my opponent has a couple of item cards that combo well and can mean big points if he can extend the game long enough, then I know to start focusing on will and pumping out cheap spells to speed the game up.

(4/17) 5. This rating may go up with a couple more plays.  The card drafting element would probably improve if I better knew them.  The tile placement/chaining optimization is also interesting.  It just didn't necessarily get me very excited for whatever reason upon my first play.

(10/17) Drop to 3.

Surprisingly clever action-chaining, combo-building, cuteness overload of a game.

Arcane academy is a neat tile laying engine building sort of a game. The graphic design in nice but basic, but the component quality is all over the place. It would have been nice for the player mats too be thicker and maybe even dual layered like Spirits of the Rice Paddy.

However the game play is quick, thoughtful and fun, as you race other players to make the best combinations of actions to achieve 8 goals first. Tiles can be linked to surrounding tiles to make stronger combinations which is a great little mechanic that elevates this game. Worth checking out.

I bought this game because I like the designers.  I've played it about half-a-dozen times with my son plus a couple more with my wife and son.

It's a solid game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  In terms of time, I think it plays in 45 minutes or less.  It has interesting decisions.  But for some reason, it doesn't resonate with me.  Maybe it's that building a set of tiles to be able to play cards/spells doesn't feel like it matches the theme especially well for me.

Still, I will happily suggest it if I don't have a lot of time and will probably only turn it down is someone else suggests it if we have time to play something longer.

First play impression: I certainly love the idea of this game. Really simple engine-building, fast turns, and perfect game length.

I'm just not sure how much the game plays you vs you playing the game. Meaning, it seems like if somebody gets a good combo early on they can sail to victory. This could be because they spotted a sweet combo and out-played the other players, but it seems more likely that they just have lucky tile draws and the right cards available at the right time.

This is one I'll play again, but I won't be buying it because it feels like luck can dictate the game.

This game was pretty much exactly what I wanted it to be, an easy to teach sort of "heavy-filler".  Everyone enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's not going to blow you away with it's novelty, it's not going to leave you thinking longingly about it's depth and strategies.  It's more of a Splendor-style game where you're in a race to build, and execute, the best engine with some neat spell combo'ing along the way.  


I wish it could go up to 5 players if I wanted to, and I wish there were a few more interesting tiles with more connections, and more assignments for variety, but it's a solid little game in modest box that I'm happy to have.

This game is on of my 'Hidden Gems'. The mechanisms in this game are very unique, the slate where you construct what kind of actions and combos you can do in a game is just one of the most fun elements I've seen in a board game. The artwork is very vibrant, rules are easy to learn but there are tons of varying paths to victory with long term planning (scoring cards) and excellent tactical decisions ( drafting and executing tiles on the slate). It plays very fast but you get a great game length to amounts of decisions kind of ratio. I highly recommend it.

I was surprised by this game. It has a theme I don't really enjoy (wizards, etc.) and it looked like a bunch of cards with a bunch of powers, which is neat but exhausting. However, that's not quite right. 

It's a zippy design, easy to grasp, with the ability to mess with your opponents but not overwhelmed by it. It has clever mechanisms that are also straightforward. A short playtime and simple scoring also help.

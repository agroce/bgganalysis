Player interaction on this one makes things quite interesting as there are enough workers to place that competing for similar paths to victory points is a legitimate strategy. Iconography is good. More variability in player conditions would be an improvement. Awesome go-to euro.

Worker placement with a railroad theme and very unforgiving exponential scoring.

The game plays over 6 rounds, scales very well from 2-4 players, and uses the classic worker placement mechanism. Each player has their own personal board which shows three major railway lines and an industry track; the goal is to progress on at least some of these tracks by moving up lower value rails in order to allow for forward movement of higher value rails. The industry track works differently in that there is no upgrading but instead lower points are paid out quicker and key bonuses can be unlocked earlier. The main rails also unlock bonuses and scoring multipliers but this usually takes some time to achieve. 

There are several different actions to choose from, including many rail movements (black, grey, brown, tan, and white which are listed in ascending value), money (which serves as a worker placement but is also required for some actions), train engines/industry cities (needed to score your rail tracks or advance your industry marker), engineers (this is one of the few innovative features of this game; there is a stack of engineers of which only a few enter a game and they can be used when on the board but once they are hired they serve as your own private, generally superior, worker location, as well they serve as the round counters and score endgame points), as well as a few other actions. 

Scoring occurs every round and it starts slowly but ramps up massively as players start to push their valuable train tracks forward.  This is where the game can be a turnoff to new players; final scores can differ by several hundred points(!) buts that's just how it works in this game.  If you can get past your first few games, it's surprisingly addictive and "fun" and it should be noted that all of the expansions really make the game shine by increasing variability significantly. 

Own the [boardgame=181693]German Railroads[/boardgame], and [boardgame=206944]American Railroads[/boardgame] expansions and the [boardgame=166410]Mini-expansion[/boardgame].

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#FF9933][b]aaj's FAVORITE WORKER PLACEMENT[/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]
[i]tl;dr - Russian Railroads has little to no theme, but the puzzle that it presents you is exciting to solve anew every time. This is my favorite way to exercise my brain with some tough reps, alongside two or three other workout buddies. Highly recommended.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

How do I love thee, let me count the ways? My father-in-law recommended Russian Railroads to me, and I bought it tentatively, because it's rather heavy compared to what I normally play. Despite this, RR has blossomed into my favorite heavy game (with the possible exception of Terra Mystica) and I always relish a chance to dive deep into its inner workings. 

Russian Railroads is, at its core, a collection of point-scoring mechanisms; but unlike a Feld game, these pieces all come together into an engine-building experience that's even thematic. You start out very slowly, earning 3 points here, 4 points there, but by the end of the game your engine has been built to full potentially and you are harvesting whole swathes of points, pulling in 60, 80, even 100 or more points per round. 

People have called this the best 'pure' worker placement game and I'm compelled to agree. The board is completely open and your only obstacles are the other players. Russian Railroads will reward players who can evaluate what everyone else is doing and construct an engine that zigs when everyone else is zagging -- this will let you take spots that have gone unnoticed and sneak into a lead! 

The base game is interesting and exciting, but a few initial moves can be on rails (the engineer/gold/double workers spaces will always be among the first picks), and German Railroads, the first expansion, totally shakes that up. You now have variable player boards, that let you specialize your tracks to meet your particular strategy. This mitigates opponents blocking you a little bit, and opens up your options. The second module, coal, also provides more spaces on the board and more ways for you to earn points. 

Let's be clear: this is multiplayer solitaire. But it's multiplayer solitaire at its absolute best, and that's OK -- sometimes you just want a puzzly game where the winner is not the one with the biggest fists, but the most finely executed strategy, brought to completion with ruthless Russian (or German!) efficiency. Highly recommended.

[thing=181693][/thing] [b][BGCOLOR=#00ff99][COLOR=#00ff99]_[/COLOR]8[COLOR=#00ff99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] - The variable player boards are a real winner so far! I enjoy the flexibility that they provide and they keep players from getting painted into a corner. RR can be a harsh game so this mitigates this a bit. Coal adds more spaces on the board and new ways to use the base structures of the game.

A great game of optimisation. This is worker-placement through and through, with very little feeling of theme. There is nice artwork throughout, but you are entirely absorbed by the mathematics of it all, not by the "world of the game". It's very clever, works well, and enjoyable.

3 plays / 3, 4 players

LIKE: Hard decisions, every option is good. Interesting mechanisms with the sliding rails. The personal board is tidy yet holds lots of information. Lots of strategies once you get to know the big combos.

DSLIKE: Unforgiving game, but that makes it interesting. Experienced players have a great advantage. First player has large advantage. Difficult to catch up when behind. Points go over 200, so counting can be fiddly and math heavy.

OVERALL: The game was quite abstract for a train game, but that doesn't bother me. Some scores compound round after round, so those are the ones to go after, making strategy limited to certain choices. After a few plays with some pointers, the game is growing on me.

RATING: 7.5
Its a Euro-worker placement game - and by that I mean it has resources in the form of tracks and workers that are used to take actions. The personal board that tracks your railroad building is first rate albeit nearly overwhelming with options. That's one of the reasons the game takes a bit of time to get off the table, but I don't think it overstays its welcome: there's alot of game to enjoy here. However, I do take pause with some aspects. As fun as the building rails system is - and how counter intuitive! - it still feels like once you play the game a few times, the surprises are essentially over. To be sure there's lots of things yet to explore at that point - but you know the paths of victory and what's left is nuances, not revolutions.

It is *very* good for all that - better with perhaps 3-4 and not 5 (the game just lasts too long). The components and general design are very polished. So I like it and would suggest playing at least a few more times.

Uno de los mejores juegos euro de colocación de trabajadores! Muy euro duro sesudo, bastante seco... sí, contruyes vías, pero en plan abstracto, avanzando sobre 3 tracks de vías, a ver quien la hace (y llega con las locomotoras) más larga! xD Adquiriendo bonos al alcanzar ciertos puntos y buscando combos de estos. La fase de colocación para las acciones es más tensa que Rajoy intentando hablar en inglés! Por ello puede ser áltamente estresante, no recomendado para mentes sensibles a la catatonia y pérdidas rápidas de cordura.
Siempre lo he jugado a 4, y me flipa que se saquen más de 400 puntos de victoria en las partidas! Falta ver cómo escala con menos jugadores. Actualizo: 3 partidas a 3, se juega perfecto :)

Russian Railroads is a relatively simple worker placement and an euro at its purest. What I especially liked was that you score several hundred points in a game, which makes those little differences count. However, the fact that you score more than half of the points in the final scoring (after the 6th round) feels a bit stupid. In the end, the first five rounds matter very little, since basically you are just building your position for the last round point rush.  And building that position is not too difficult. 
 
What I would have liked to see is possibility for great plays in the early game as well.

Rating dropped after a few more plays. The game has started to feel rather one dimensional. You select a strategy and push it with 100%. There is no changing plans in the mid-game even if you see that your chosen strategy is heavily contested.

Wow!  I like this one!  Pure worker placement for individualized benefits along 4 tracks on individual player boards.  The interactions among the disparate elements mean there are a few different directions to pursue and you will always, ALWAYS want to do more than you can.  WHICH IS AWESOME!

I was a little concerned with some of the spots on the central board being generally more powerful than others up until I realized that the real balance is in the opportunity cost of taking these spots before other, even more desirable ones.  That is, getting extra workers for a round is nice up until it costs you the spot(s) you wanted to use them on.  WHICH IS AWESOME!  MORE TENSION AND A META GAME!  WOOT!

So yeah, there's all this potential for screwage and meta gaming and intrinsic balance via opportunity costs.  And there are a few personal choices to be made and they really are rather significant.  WHICH IS ALSO AWESOME!  Also, each game will be at least a little different via the different engineers used.  I wish there was a bit more replay value, but maybe there's an expansion or two lurking in the wings.  Or maybe the engineers are enough?  NEED MORE PLAYS!

Rating has the potential to go down (or up, I suppose) after more plays but I don't know that it will.  I *really* like this game!

1st Play: Really hard to judge this game. There's an engine building aspect to it that I very much missed in my first play through. It did seem like a good early round would lead a little bit to a runaway leader problem. I knew I was out of it by round 3. I'm not typically a fan of that in games.

2nd Play: This game turned out to be a prime example of why a game needs to be played twice before I rate it. It's still not amazing, but I had a decent time playing it. The action choices made more sense, the way the tracks work seemed to flow better, and I understood what was going on more completely.

A fun euro to be sure, but it's a little distressing that the first three actions of each turn seem to be pretty scripted in a 4 player game (engineer purchase, money acquisition, and dual worker pickup). The opportunity cost of choosing when to be first/second player is important then, and multiple paths seem to be valid strategies as in my game I saw a heavy tech specialization lose barely to a heavy rail specialization. 

The theme is paper thin at best, and really is kind of just pasted on, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless and plays pretty quick for what it is. I'd play it again for sure.

Edit: Okay, so this is playing like a 10 right now. I'm sure the lack of a randomness and the small amount of engineers / scoring cards will possibly make the game run out of steam, but it's currently really fun to play. Namely, progressing along the tracks feel like you're unlocking achievements and the scoring each round, seeing how your gameplay is ramping the game up. Going from six points a round to a hundred does feel satisfying and like the nice culmination of a game's worth of strategy.

---------------------------------------------------

Parts of it may eventually feel a bit scripted (grabbing Engineers and then money) or certain tracks might not be completely balanced (e.g., it seems that at least getting the bonus tokens from St. Petersburg is near mandatory) or the bonus tokens themselves might not be balanced and etc.

And, of course, this does become a bit of a concern as there is such little variability between games and no randomness after the setup (I guess maybe some uncertainty in not knowing which bonus cards have been removed as far as directing strategy). So there are certainly concerns regarding that and also the inability to kneecap a leader and etc.

Nevertheless, it was a very satisfying game to play. All of the components sort of mesh nicely and the whole scale of the game is pleasing and doesn't feel too artificially inflated. In some games the game will introduce something to artificially ramp things up (I think, quintessentially, the extra worker from Lords of Waterdeep fits this in a way to make later turns feel like more is going on). Obviously, the massive uptick in Russian Railroads is sort of artificially codified into the game, but it feels thematic and is rewarding.

Just a game that was lots of fun for me.

Russian Railroads does have trains with numbers that denote how far they can travel, in the style of 18xx games.  There the similarity to 18xx ends and a fairly abstract optimisation game of development along four tracks - three of them railways, one industry - begins. A focus on one track over others provides the strategic options.  There's a hatful of opportunities to score victory points. Worker placement is the main mechanism and, as in the best games of this sort, throws up some real dilemmas of prioritisation. 

Russian Railroads is handsomely produced with artwork that adds a thick gloss of theme.

It's a good game but with some ugly warts.  I will admit that I warmed to it just a little tonight.  It has limited strategies which, I fear, limit it's replayability.

This is a "classic" worker placement game with a nice theme and beautiful pieces. There are multiple strategies while the rules are simple and straightforward. The final is epic, you may reach 150 points (out of the max 400+) in the last turn, rewarding players for a long term strategy. While there's no obvious innovation, the game plays flows nicely and the mechanisms are well glue together.

Not entirely sure why this game is so highly ranked on BGG at the moment.  It seems like a nice enough "puzzle" wherein you use very straightforward worker placements to advance markers of different colors on your player card in order to earn victory points each round.  

Presumably, the thrill is in figuring out how to squeeze out the most VP's by manipulating different colored markers (track markers they say) better than the other players. Each player quietly does their manipulations on their boards with the other players not really watching.

Theme is strangely close to nonexistent in this game, really an afterthought. Interactivity feels nonexistent, and curiously, lower than your average worker placement game.  Still, it is sort of fun in a mellow way.  There might be some replayability here as you experiment with manipulating your markers from game to game, though actually, I cannot envision much fun in doing those experiments.  I might play one more time I suppose.

This is basically a "victory point salad" worker placement euro game with very pasted on theme. But it's fun and very tight. The tough decisions, small race game elements and clever blocking of opponents are the biggest pluses and I think the (point)engine building aspect is very satisfying. The components and art are great and even manage to bring some theme to the otherwise totally mechanically themeless (or at least the gameplay does not support the theme at all, especially the factory-line) game. Replayability is also a big issue as there is little randomness in the setup and the amount of strategic variance is not that great. Still, the game manages to be interesting every time it hits the table.

Even though I don't llllove it, and aspects of it seem subject to path optimization, I think this is a shining example of what a middleweight gamer's game should be.  The railroad stuff itself doesn't sing to me as a theme, but it's not invisible.  The game has a healthy amount happening, and it's fun to explore.  Kudos.

There is lots of meat here. There are perhaps 30% more rules explanation than ideal. Has the right number of turns: feels like all different sorts of focuses can pay off about the same. whereas if it was shorter points right away would dominate or a turn longer and the trans-siberian would be unstoppable.
Works best with 4, but still very enjoyable with 2,3.

The archetypical railroad game: A working theme, mechanics that appear to be complex but are rather simple, "block this" interaction, nice design and a certain amount of boredom. 

I like the general idea, but having a game where you block other's choices just to realize that in the end, everyone gets VP no matter what the players actually do is not that amazing. It's not worth the hype, but not a bad game.

RATING: 8
Mathsy 'point salad' approach to scoring, and tight worker placement gameplay. There's very little benefit to blatantly 'take-that' style play, as every action has the potential to advance the construction of your own scoring engine. Theme is painted on really doesn't seem much rationale for four rival companies to be building railway lines between the same three Russian cities at the same time, but really, that's never stopped a Euro. What shines through is the tight design that definitely leaves you completely mentally drained at the end of it's surprisingly long play time. A solid wp game, that suffers from a lack of sexiness.

RATING: 7.7
Initial rating, based on playing once. I find this one quite hard to rate. There's nothing in the game which really stands out as particularly positive or negative. It's well put together, with moderately interesting mechanics (I always like worker placement) and seemingly well balanced between the different available strategies. There, I guess, there's a slight negative, in that those strategies seem to be pretty limited in number, making me think that replayability will be on the low side. The game reminds me in many ways of Snowdonia. Has a quite distinct feel and flavour to it, but its general... "blandness" somehow feels the same.
Still, for the moment I like it, and definitely wouldn't mind playing again. I don't think I need to own it, though.

First game.  Was pleased to win with my Kiev and St Petersburg purple hex strategy against the trend and others’ expectations.  Nearly slipped up by giving around 50 points away when returning a couple of early trains.  Really liked the way I had a huge lead mid game but was clawed back to within two points by the white track.  Quite a balancing act by the HiG team I think.  Excellent game.  First rate graphics.  Clear and logical.  If only other publishers would follow suit.

Nagyon jó és kiforrott játék, sok jó apró ötlettel. Tetszik a mozdony- és sínfejlesztés alapkoncepciója, és nekem a téma is átjön, nem értek egyet azokkal, akik szerint totál absztrakt, és bármi más is lehetne a téma vasút helyett. Az ikonrendszer szuper, nekem a Tzolkint idézte abból a szempontból, hogy minden infó a táblán van. Néhány dolog ami tetszett még: a sorrend kompenzáló GYP-k, az iparosítás (csak akkor lépegethetünk, ha közben gyárakat is építünk), és tetszett, hogy figyeltek a részletekre, pl. az utolsó körben már nincs értelme a sorrendre menni, ezért akkor egy újabb akció jelenik meg. Egy kicsit szokni kell a nagy pontszámokat, kevés olyan játék van, ahol ennyire dőlnek a 20-30-50 pontok:) Sokutasnak tűnik egyébként, ez jó! Bár kicsit erősnek tűnt elsőre tisztán a felső vasútra menni.
---
Néhányat aludtam a játékra: Ha valaki lemarad, kérdés, hogy mennyire tud visszajönni a játékba. Másrészt kevés a random faktor a játékban (a mérnökök random kerülnek be az elején, de végig láthatjuk, melyikek játszanak majd, illetve 2 végcél kártya is kiesik mindig), ezért gyanús, hogy számolható, melyik részre éri meg rámenni. Valószínűleg a tábla felső része az erősebb, de majd utánaszámolok.

After seeing a play through this game intrigued me to hunt it down and I'm glad I did. While I understand, people without that sense of 'seeing' the tracks laid down and being built, can't enjoy it like I can, I really enjoy the strong sense of choice, Do I focus on Industry, Technology or Tracks for points, don't forget the mini game of Engineers, Which Track matches my path best? It really feels like a clean direction and I have yet to find a "best path"

that said, They could replace the wooden 'track icons' with 3D printed tracks that snap together to form little train tracks, with a little train icon, showing the 'furthest path' and it would bring so many people to this game.

My first impression is overall good. I like worker placement games and this one is not an exception. However there were a few minor problems I've had with this game. First of all - at least in my group - two first actions that were taken were "two coins" and "two temporary workers". I don't like when games have such must-take-first actions, those should depend on one's situation, and not be almost always the first thing to grab. Secondly, I didn't feel there was enough interaction. There are so many similar action places to choose from that you do not really feel like you're blocking someone. If you do, you do it as a side effect of an action you wanted to choose anyway. Due to that I feel like everybody was playing his own game with very little interaction with other players. I will give it more plays, however I wouldn't like it to turn into a multiplayer-solitaire optimization type of game, because I'd rather have more blocking options. Maybe as we know the game more we'll draft those engineers and other bonuses more consciously, more wary of other players' choices.

This is a train-themed game designed by an 18XX designer. But it is absolutely not am 18XX game!
Russian Railroads is instead a resource-management worker-placement game.

The games lasts 7 rounds (6 in two-player), during which players must develop three different russian railroads. Each player develops his own railroad in his own player board: there is no common board for the tracks (there's no tracks at all to be placed!) as in other train-themed games. The common board has instead the action spaces (like in most worker placement games), that are exclusive (once used, it is not available until next round), and players take turns placing workers (some action spaces require more than one) until everybody passes.
Rinse and repeat for 6 (5) more rounds.

So, what about the game if everything sounds familiar?

The unusual crossover of theme and mechanics is intriguing per se, but there's more to it than what I previously said! 
1. The three different railroads can be developed with different colored tracks (I guess they symbolize various kind of luxury wagons offered to passengers). This is quite unique and the choices you're making are very tight.
2. Every railroad gives you access to different kind of developments and, since you can't do everything, you must specialize and different strategies seem to be available.
3. There's also another way to make points: by developing factories, and this is another possible way to go.

Overall, there's lots of interlocking parts in the game, and it's a great brainburner (about the same weight as Agricola) of a game.

Lots of lovely components although the down side with that is a little more set up and put down time.  Would take a little time to explain and probably with the zero luck in the game its a game that who knows it best will win.  Still the amount of strategic planning, the combo moves, unlocking extra meeples and train line types all looks lots of fun.   Like that they have got it set up to scale well from 2-4.  Played this a lot online and own the German Railroads expansion which adds a lot of variety to the game.  Also the mini expansion is a lot of fun too.

It took me a while to finally play this. The game has a great graphic design. Not to be confused with a train game like Ticket to Ride. A very enjoyable worker placement game with a lot of options. I worry that there isn't nearly enough variability in setup to play this long term. Also, I have a sense that this game can have a runaway leader problem. If someone gets up on you, it is hard to make up enough ground to catch them. You can basically play the same strategy each game. The expansion is supposed to correct this issue. With all of that being said... I really love this game after many plays. That is without playing the expansion. Something about selecting the worker actions against other opponents is so challenging and rewarding. It seems like the variety of engineers adds a little more variety than I initially thought as well. This game is surprisingly climbing in my rankings.

First play: Worker placement which translates to the constructions of track and purchase of trains of escalating range that build a point scoring engine over 6 rounds.

While I have some issues with a few logical inconsistencies (why does the gray track only get you 90% of the way there?), this is a fine worker placement game.

Towards the end, the amount of victory point calculations you are doing is a little ridiculous.

It's just another point salad. Might satisfy you in the short run but will leave you wanting more very soon. Glad I got to play this before I pulled the trigger on buying this one.

RATING: 8
Pro's:

1) The points ramp up is quite spectacular, scoring a measly 5 points or something in the first round and then scoring 100+ at the last rounds is very fun.
2) The slow progression of the tracks feels great. While it isn't exactly like you are actually building the railroad thematically, it does feel great to progress each individual track or the industry track.
3) Plays very quickly for a game of that weight.
4) Aesthetically very pretty. Has one of my favourite colour schemes of any board game I own. Plus the little rail pieces are very cute.

Con's:

1) Playing sub-optimally will mean you lose quite badly. You are likely looking at a difference of 100 + points in some cases. While I don't think it is a major flaw, I think some players would feel significantly disheartened.
2) I always wish I could do more or progress more tracks in the game.

Not sure:

1) The scoring phase, I honestly don't know here. As it is both tied to the fun element of the ramp up and the not so fun element of teaching it. The game provides the little guide sheet, though players are so unsure that they are doing it correctly that I invariably have to double check their scores.

Lighter, faster and simpler than I thought. A fun worker placement game which is reasonably tight and certainly contains enough interest to make me want to play it a few times over. Strategy seems to be to score really highly on 2 of the 4 tracks rather than fairly well on some of them.

RATING: 10
This game is so brilliant, so amazingly fantastic!!! Now this is absolutely my favourite Euro game, best worker placement game of all times! And I have over 40 games in my colleaction, so I have a base to compare...

Russian Railroads plays really smooth, the rules are very intuitive and easy to explain. With people who didn't play it before it takes ~15 minutes to explain everything. So far everybody with whom I've played it enjoyed it the most among all of our games, and demanded to play more and more. Now the game has even became the favourite game of my wife, even though she is not a fan of strategic economy boardgames.

Russian Railroads is easy to understand and get used to, however it has extremely deep mechanism and huge amount of choices how you build up your strategy. You can win the game many many ways, and there are no standard ways for what you have to go for. 

Forget the simplicity of Carcassonne or the over-complication of Bora Bora. Forget about long long explanation of Agricola. Russian Railroads succeeded there, where the other games failed to balance: it can be simple to explain and understand the same time while it offers a huge variety of playing and multiple choices for your strategy, at the same time offering great fun for everybody.

// Russian Railroads is a worker-placement game and it's
pretty heavy on planning, which is actually great because
it makes for very interesting decisions. The game is just
open enough where getting blocked on an action isn't the
end of the world, but can still hurt. My only complaint is
that engineering scoring is probably too strong and can
swing the end-game score too significantly.

GrandCon 2014 - 3 player game; learning game for two new players who were destroyed by the experienced player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable worker placement game with several ways to score points, but the point values feel imbalanced; therefore I'm not confident that there are multiple paths to victory.  Perhaps playing exclusively with experienced players will improve the balance.  The purple track seems too lucrative considering that no engine is needed; meanwhile, it takes a large effort to generate points from railroad construction (advance track marker, obtain engine, unlock next more valuable track (color), advance that track marker, repeat).  Also, the second path seems useless except for unlocking bonus  chits.

There is almost no luck in the game aside from the sequence/setup of the engineer tiles (which is public information) and the choices/mistakes made by opponents during the game.  My biggest complaint is that there is too much contention over turn order and the engineer tiles (partly because there are very few good actions).  Also, the engineers are probably too powerful... giving you private action spaces for workers and a chance at a large point windfall (40/20 for most/2nd most).  My secondary complaint (and partial compliment) is that the game is fairly unforgiving of mistakes and suboptimal moves; experienced players usually an and can be runaway leaders, making the game difficult to introduce to and enjoy with newbies.

This game is as good as a worker placement game with very low interaction can get. It does give you a lot of options and rewards planning. 

On the bad side: It is quite unforgiving, does have a runaway-leader problem and is rather mathsy. There's no way to comeback after a bad start.

On the good side it manages to offer a variety of strategies and still remains mostly intuitive. The playtime is ok.

RATING: 4
Provisional rating, might change if I play it again (probably down to a 4 ...)

I can see why some people love this game - if you like worker placement and VP optimisation games, give it a try.

For me it is too abstract, I felt no real connection with the theme based on the mechanics. No idea why I have black track then brown then white, which score different (increasing points) nor why some things cost rubles and some don't.

All in all - nothing I haven't seen before and no desire to own, and little to play again.

But I would play it again, nothing here to completely turn me off.

** Update, and down to a 4 (as I predicted), really don't play this with AP prone players, there's too much analysis, and it rewards planning and having a strategy rather than react to what happens in game. All in all, many other games I'd rather play.

In a 4 player game you had more than 20 times a lot to Accounting for final standing bigger than 300 VP´s. Late at evening you better use your calculator. This game is like solving and creating an excel sheet. So i prefer to play a 18xx with more direct competition and will pass the russian locomotive calculator game.

A solid, medium-weight Euro with a great rulebook.  

It has a little bit of an 18XX-theme, but very little.  There are basically 3 different paths and specialization is rewarded.  

It's good enough that it's gotten 20+ plays but it's nothing special.

Pure worker placement and engine building, with a thin veneer of train theme.  Russian Railroads is a fascinating study on the worker placement mechanism, and how to build a game where all players start with the same stuff and rapidly wind up with different incentives and values for commonly available stuff.  

Ultimately, while I liked the single play of RR I had on yucata, this game always seemed to be a little too long, a little too opaque, and a little too rule heavy for my usual gaming partners, and I never had the courage to bring it out.  I think it's a great game, but there's no reason for me to own it.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores muy elegante y muy bien calculado. No tiene ninguna mecánica complicada o especialmente novedosa, pero está muy bien calculado el juego. En todo momento ofrece muchas posibilidades. Puntuaciones muy altas, en el rango 200-400. No es un juego para no iniciados, porque es un poco quemacerebros, pero si uno es jugón, garantizado que le gustará. (si te van los euros, se entiende).

The theme here has zero bearing on the game play. It could have easily been themed practically anything, so don't play this if you want a train themed game. If, however, you want a game that makes you constantly shift your strategy as other people place their workers before you, you will love this. This is a game that will have you saying at the end of the game, "I should've ! Let's play again!"

Feels like a pretty standard, well designed worker placement game. 
Almost no connection to the subject matter
though. One thing that was intriguing was that although
(like most WP games) jumping first down a path has advantages,
there is also some benefit to coming later to particular 
strategies - trains and factories improve over time, so
the first person obtaining them gets less valuable goods.

Solid seeming gameplay with a lot of options, fitting the
modern pattern of difficult to figure out optimal strategy
within the constraints of others' picks. Probably take
anyone a few plays to really grasp.

Great Euro worker placement game. Really not much in the way of theme tie in, but discrete paths to victory without the game becoming a point salad is the highlight.

It's more subtle then you might think after first few plays. You really have to read the engineers. Plenty of room for expansions with ? token and engineers.

Worker placement at it's finest, but after some 20 games or so you feel a bit limited in the base game and presumably know the best strategies.

Played online at Yucata.  This is a game that has not clicked with me.

I can not work out what option is best, so felt I was just randomly placing my meeples.  Others clearly can work out a strategy, since I lose badly each game.

This may be a game you really have to work at to get good, but I did not find it fun enough to want to do this.

Behind the fantastic components and the thin theme, this is another worker placement game. And while I enjoy playing RRR, I wonder if it has the legs of other games in the genre. There aren't many strategies, and I doubt you can win by playing tactically on a turn-by-turn basis. Future plays will determine whether it is a keeper or not.

Ugh. Another Worker Placement VP salad grab. Themeless abstract. Games aren't balanced leading to huge blowouts. 
Absolutely nothing original.

Pick 2 of the 4 tracks, and stick to it.

Please, no more unoriginal WP that contribute nothing to the genre.

So tired of WP games where extra workers is always the best thing to do ASAP.

No thanks.

Streamlined workerplacement game with interesting theme which falls a little flat. I liked the game still quite a bit because of the elegant mechanisms which feel to be developed well.

Do you want to play a rail game where you get to build sprawling track in Russia and convey goods and passengers over vast distances? Do you want to play a game where you ruthlessly run rail companies, wheel and deal shares on a dynamic stock market, smell the diesel and taste the vodka? If you do, then DO NOT play this game. Have you ever wanted to run an excel spreadsheet on a player board-fruit machine to maximise points on various dials? Well then, this is your game - a dry multiplayer solitaire Euro masquerading as a rail game. The sad part is that there is a generation of gamers out there now who will never have tried the 18xx series. Sure, they have flaws, but I would tell anyone who wants to play a train game to go play one of these ( 1830 ideally to start off ). There you actually build track, buy/sell shares, run a company, engage with players and perform railroad activities that fit in with the theme. It is a sorry state of affairs where a lifeless,  abstract VP fruitsalad like this, without any real railroad features can make the top 50 and get lapped up.

I owned this game and have played about a dozen times.  While I like it, I haven't decided yet whether I love it.  I have not yet mastered the game by any stretch.  But, it seems there are only a couple of primary strategies to follow--from there it is executing tactics.  Not yet sure this will have staying power.

Choo choooooo....

It's nice to see a fresh take at a train game.  I really enjoy the combination of worker placement and the way the track types work in this game.   

The only problem I've got really is that it appears there are only a small number of viable strategies, and it is absolutely critical that you not do something that someone else is doing in order to maximize your opportunity.   The problem, of course, is that a player who decides to do what you're doing well after you have started doing it can... derail... your game pretty quickly.

So I wish there were more viable strategies, but apart from that this is a great game.

Rating may be premature, but wow, what an amazing game. It has all of the limiting/blocking tension of a typical worker placement game, but with the most kick-ass action and scoring combos I've ever seen in a Euro. What I love most is that everything in the game seems good: all the tracks are good, the orange tokens are all amazingly good, the engineers are all good, and it is difficult to figure out which combinations of good things will benefit you the most. Building too much infrastructure will make you fall behind over the early rounds, but if you can time it right, you will be scoring an unbelievable number of points by the end of the game (my favorite moment of our first play was when we scored a round and someone said, "WHAT!?! How could you have possibly scored THAT??").

I've never had so much fun doing multiplication.

A solid worker placement game with multiple paths to victory.  It's pretty fun picking your chosen path and trying to run with it.

However, I think it has a bit of mechanism overload, and isn't quite as streamlined as I like to see.  Some things are a bit clunky feeling, and feel like they may have been added on for the sake of balance.  Either that, or some designers just keep designing well past the point where it seems like a finished game.

I'm not totally saying the complexity and mechanisms and top of mechanisms is bad, per se, especially once you know the game.  It just makes it one of those games I'm totally going to forget how to play between playings, meaning at some point it won't come off the shelf because I won't feel like re-learning it.

Overall, a well done worker placement game on the heavier end of the spectrum; it's just one I don't find myself getting back to or desiring to play.

Solid worker placement game about building railroads across (you guessed it) Russia! Despite the common train theme, the game is a lot of fun to play and provides ample opportunities to score satisfying combos and score tons of tons of points. My biggest complaint about the game is the absence of variability in the set up. The same actions, goals, and bonuses are in every game and therefore it becomes a bit stale once players have had a chance to figure out the best strategies. Because of this, I tend to prefer its card-based twin, First Class.

I really like the set up and how this game plays. Worker placement to advance your track on your own player board. It does feel like it may suffer from being very samey from game to game as not much varies from game to game and we had a slight worry of the rich getting richer possibility. 4 Plays.

Russian Railroads surprised me with how interconnected different parts of a game could be. I thought Tzolk'in was the peak of having various things interlocking. However, the way the 3 rails + the industry track connect together, each allowing the others to inch up further, and increasing the value of each other- this really surprised me. I made it to almost 300pts the last time I played, but as the game comes with a 400pt+ marker, I look forward to coaxing these interlocking tracks using a better strategy, and have them start singing for me a multitude of points.

This is straight forward individual player board worker placement. Like most games where players have individual boards, this game has a solitaire, puzzle-optimization feel to it. It also has the point salad feel of a Stefan Feld game, but without any of the ingenious mechanisms that make some of his games at least somewhat fun and interesting for me. 

Basically, all you do in this game is build track. Most of the available actions are building track. You can also take more guys/coins to build more track. You can select an engineer character which gives you a private action for the rest of the game - most of the engineer actions are building track. You can take a locomotive action, so you can use your built track for special privileges (extra workers and other bonuses). The purpose of building track is to get different colored track so you can build that track, for even more track-building excitement!!!! And then there is industry, which lets you move a purple disc on another track for points. What variety!

It really is that tedious and boring and repetitive. Even for people that like this type of game, I can't see it having any replayability - the setup is the same each time (outside of having different engineers) and there is little to nothing dynamic happening between the players that would give rise to variability. 

There is nothing in the game that makes you feel like you are doing anything other that moving track shaped pieces in a line. Compare this to Snowdonia, a similarly themed game that I much prefer. There is a great feel of building a shared railroad, clearing rubble and laying track through different weather conditions, until you reach the top of the mountain. Everyone is fighting on the same track, and the weather and order of the dummy actions all add to a very tight and variable experience. 

I give this a few points because the rules are pretty simple - you are up and running relatively quickly and it plays fast. 1st play 4 players was less than 2 hours with rules explanation, so this should come in at 60 minutes with experience. So for those reasons, I wouldn't fight too hard if it were to be suggested by others. But I still can't believe the hype this is getting. Feels very generic to me.

RATING: 4
This game is really interesting. It basically represents an optimization problem, which you get better at solving every time you play. 

However, after a few plays, the game becomes repetitive and a lack in replayability becomes apparent. Perfect information without options for different setups just isn't for us. Up for trade/sell it goes.

Russian Railroads is a very good game, in fact it’s almost a great game! It’s a very good worker placement game in which you actually aren’t collecting resources and converting them to victory points, so that’s refreshing. It’s relatively deep and has some very interesting strategic decisions. I like that you can pursue various strategies (points from industries, bonus chits, high point rail tracks, doublers on the Sibirian track etc.) Also, there isn’t any randomness in RR at all, except for the starting player and which engineers are available throughout the game; just like in Terra Mystica. This is something I love in hardcore eurogames. Even though some claim that a game need randomness and variety in order to be interesting, Terra Mystica (and perhaps RR) are examples that prove this wrong in my opinion. As said, the only randomness is which engineers are available during the game, but they are all face up before the game starts, so you can build your strategy around those available. 

However… Russian Railroads definitely has a problem. A serious problem actually. And that’s the replayability, or rather lack of it. Sure, there are various engineers, but they don’t really change the game too much, and basically there are only 3 tracks with 3 different strategies (or a combination of them). It’s not just me who raise this question about the lack of replayability – it’s something everybody I know who has played RR also says… On the other hand, I have tried it 13 times, which is an extremely impressive number for me as I often play a game just a couple of times. This is a testament to how great RR is. But there is absolutely no doubt about it that the enjoyment you get out of Russian Railroad diminishes over time as the game starts to feel kind of the same due to how few strategies you can pursue in the game… Regarding these strategies, the two major are probably Vladivostik and Kiev+factories. The St. Petersburg-strategy (double points on track number 7) is a tough one to pull off because it also requires you to advance on the Vladivostok route, and the tracks can net you a lot more points on that route due to the white tracks. However, I can confirm that I’ve won a game by using this strategy, so it’s not impossible, but it’s definitely a much weaker strategy than the rest. 

Oh, and speaking of the St. Petersburg line, I’ve never seen anybody not getting both of their bonus tokens in play (although it was a close call once, and maybe it did happen in 1 out of 13 plays). It’s simply rather easy to get, so it doesn’t make sense not to get those bonuses; and that’s a pity. Again, some more strategies/paths to victory or other action spaces or something would enhance the variety and therefore replayability, because as it stands now there isn’t a whole lot to do. You can mix some paths, but it likely won’t do you any good. RR almost forces you to focus on a single strategy at the beginning of the game and then pound that, whether being Vladivostok or Kiev+factories etc. It’s too hard to change strategy and shift your focus, and I don’t really like the huge focus on strategy over tactics.

Speaking of strategy/tactics, coins seem pretty important as they essentially give you an extra action, though it also means that you forfeit a better action immediately (as you take the coin action now). Workers are also good. But probably the best spot is the engineer, which costs you a gold, so you need to have a coin and be first in player order. It’s not always the case, but it’s honestly quite rare that the starting player doesn’t grab an engineer or coins if he hasn’t got any. The engineers give a bonus action only you can use (so they cannot be blocked), and they’re usually quite powerful. Not only that, but they also give you 40 or 20 points at the end of the game if you have the majority. Speaking of points, you get a gazillion of them in this game! However, unlike Stefan Feld games, you don’t get them for doing everything, and as I said you cannot do a little bit of everything (unlike, say, CoB or Trajan). Winning scores are usually over 400, but it could also very well be below 300 – it depends on the number of players, the engineers and how fast players buy trains; if all of the players sit and wait for the rest to buy the lower numbered trains, the scores will be lower. I’ve actually won every single one of my plays of RR with various strategies (all of them I would say?), and though there isn’t a recipe for victory, I would say that extra coins are important as well as getting an extra worker asap as well as getting at least 3 chips, one of them being the one which gives you an end-game scoring card. Engineers are important too, but I’ve won many games in which I only had 1 or max 2. Also, while the 9-train is powerful, it isn’t broken as some people say.

I’ve played it a handful of times as a two player game – and those games have taken around 30-45 minutes with one of the games taking 20 minutes! Yes, 20 minutes! That’s just insane! And it wasn’t because we didn’t think about what to do, it’s just that if you have a strategy, you know what to do without thinking too much. One of my plays with 3 players took 1 hour, and for such a relatively meaty game this is awesome! It’s a tense game with 4; with 2, the competition isn’t as fierce as there are too many spots (as is the case with 3), and you probably go for two different strategies meaning you don’t really compete over the same spots. But, truth be told, I would play this game again with any number of players!

So, all in all I like Russian Railroads, but I have to once again mention the caveat of the limited replayability. I played it 8 times in 1 month and 12 times from November to January, but I haven’t played it since. I think RR benefits of not being played repeatedly because of the few strategies available – and that’s why I ultimately ended up selling it. Still, it’s a good game and I hope they publish an expansion which opens up for more strategies, more variety in the setup and hence a better replayability. Edit: they have released an expansion, German Railroads... So now I had to purchase RR again, and I don't regret it one bit as it really is an excellent game, especially if not played extensively in a short span (but that goes for almost every game except for perhaps Agricola and games like that).

Still has to try this one more often; by now I don't know if all the different paths for VP are really equally strong, or if the Transsiberian route is dominant.

There's nothing really new in this "just another worker placement", but it's got a very big PLUS-factor: it's deep, it's complex - but it plays in 60 minutes!

Update: gets very repetitious; not really a game to try different strategies, which is a pity. Thought about getting the expansion German Railroads, but in the end it doesn't hit the table often enough, thus sold.

This game has nothing to do with railroads.  It's a points-fest without a theme that could just as easily have been done with different colored widgets.  I grew tired of waiting for other people to min/max their options and felt that there was no thematic strategy, only a dedication to a specific point-grabbing scheme, hoping that other people didn't beat you to the things you wanted.

Many people like it and I respect that.  I hate it.  I have a copy and will, seriously, trade it for just about anything.

Awesome worker placement game! The rulebook is written so well, makes the game even better. The game is simple yet complex, and the decisions making is fantastic. Scoring certainly does escalate later in the game. It may seem a little repetitive with consecutive plays and following similar strategies but still a fun engaging game. Combined with the expansion I would rate a 9.

RATING: 9
This is a great worker placement game. There are a lot of great choices because a lot of the spaces are good and blocking your opponents seems to play a big role. There are many ways to score points and the limited power/objective cards open up many opportunities. The black rails being limiters is a cool mechanic, and makes the spots to move them compete with the other good spots. I just hope that repeated plays don't show one spot to be too good (the money space) or one strategy to be too dominant (extending te second line for the two ? Spaces). First play impressions are extremely positive. 

--after 3 plays, this may be in contention of my favorite worker placement game.

There is too much math each round for the theme to really come through so I felt the game was just too dry for me. If there was a better way to calculate score I'd probably have gotten into it more, but it felt like I was just moving tracks around.

With that said the engine building is crazy as you go from a few points at the start to almost 100 at the end so if you love engine building this may be the game for you.

One play and I'm pretty sure I will avoid this game. Not because it is bad, but because it is not what I like. It is a point-salad if ever there was one. Points just littered all over your player board, the cards, the engineers, everywhere! Admittedly, you don't just get these points thrown at you. There is thought required. But the problems the game asks you to solve are efficiency questions. As usual in these types of games, the interaction is in the form of blocking, so the secondary problem the game presents is understanding what path your opponent is on.

The fact is, RR is really very good in its class. And, to the degree that I occassionally look for this type of constructive entertainment, I'm likely to reach for this one.

Wonderfully deep worker placement game.  (Despite the 'rail' name/theme, it is not a 'rail' game).  You place workers on the main game board to build several increasingly valuable tracks along three routes, one main route and two smaller ones.  The main track will likely be the lion's share of your points, while the smaller tracks offer bonuses to help you win.  There is also an industrial track that mechanically works very similar to the above tracks, which offer custom bonuses based on the type of factory you build there.  Engineers can be employed and eventually purchased to assist in your domination of the Russian rail system. 

It's a wonderfully designed game in almost every way.  The only possible negative is that it is very math intensive.  Scoring happens seven times during the game and final scores can reach several hundred points.  While this isn't an issue for my group, others may be turned off on it.

Too many notes, my dear Mozart.

A toybox giddily overstuffed with bits and gewgaws and ever more ways to score points. Plays like De Vulgari Eloquentia if someone swapped out your Adderall for MDMA, a la the old commercials for Folgers Crystals. It's a solidly designed game at heart and I'm sure it would reward repeated play but like a lot of the currently chic style of worker placement games with their nominal-at-best themes and their crying lack of interaction and their propensity to Make It Rain with the VPs like so many NFL defensive backs in so many seedy gentlemen's clubs, I ultimately found myself indifferent.

Slap these same mechanics on a game with a narrative that justifies them and I might come around for a second helping.

The theme of railroading is not very prevalent in actual gameplay.  I didn't feel like I was building a railroad, or running factories.  I felt like I was playing a points-salad Euro.  That said, the game was very well done with many options to score points, and not very hard to learn.  I would definitely play again . . . but I have a sinking feeling that at higher levels of play, it's a tight contest for a few key things, and if two players at the table are pursuing the same strategy, they are likely to lose.  But that's just conjecture.

Expansions: German Railroads

Notes:

Thoughts: Quickly becoming one of our favorite games. The learning curve is steep enough that you want to make sure new players commit to at least a couple of games before beginning. After that the game really shines with multiple paths to victory and strategies determined each game by what spaces other players take and what engineers are available.

Initial reaction after one game:
After reading the rules, this felt like an easy 8+. But upon playing it, I realized that I don't think it has enough variety for me. I mean, there are different paths you can take, but there isn't much interacting with other players along the way. I mean, yeah, you're competing for the same action spaces, those action spaces make up like 97% of the player interaction. This is pretty much a multi-player solitaire optimization exercise. Honestly I don't think players even really cared what other players were doing. Even when scoring (simultaneously), all players added up their own scores, and moved their score markers. 

I would really like to see a little more game-induced variety. There is a [i]tiny[/i] bit in the order of engineers that come out. Which is seen during setup, and zero randomness during the game. Engineers are kinda nice in that they are worker spaces that are not static. But that's not much. Maybe everyone should be dealt a random end-game goal card or something--I don't know--but this definitely feels like the kind of game where a player can decide they're going to do XYZ and then proceed to do exactly that. I'm realizing I'm not a big fan of games where players can map out the whole game in advance.

Having said all that, it's still a decent worker placement game, which I hope to get a few more plays out of.

10 years of worker placement design has culminated in this offspring: stock-standard worker placement choices of Snowdonian simplicity. Nothing original has been attempted here, and that is to some extent saddening: more was definitely possible here. Of course there is some blocking of desired actions, but if that is an issue move the starting player through an action and do what you want on the next turn.

The game itself is then nearly completely relegated to the players' own boards. In the finest Euro tradition these have nothing to do with the supposed subject, and are all about whirls and whorls to squeeze points from their structures. Differently coloured H-profile tokens walk down track, with later pieces never being able to overtake earlier ones. Since points are to be had for how much track is behind a coloured piece, you want the highest grossing colour to be as far along the track as possible, necessitating movement of all preceding colours even further. Along the track there are various events like H-profile colour unlocking, bonus points, bonus tokens, and world peace. In total there are four tracks: three resembling a railroad where the profile tokens move, and one for a simple hexagon token which simply moves from start to end representing level of industrial development. The further long a player is along this track, the more points he obtains. To make matters even more difficult a 'train' indicates the maximum distance to which points are awarded: so while your profile tokens can be further along the track, if the train doesn't match them, you've been inefficient. Trains can be upgraded, and the upgraded trains turn over and become one time industry actions which fill in gaps in the industry track.

The game plays more or less as you might imagine. It is a point amassing design which is mostly uninteresting: and it is that because it really adds nothing to the body of titles already out there. But I suppose one can say it works, and that is not altogether bad praise. What I disliked after my first skirmishes though, is that the dynamics of VP gathering are far in my uncomfortable zone, to the point of unplayability: with a little effort scores of 400+ points are possible. Considering that with the same effort you can score 125+ of them on the last of your 7 turns, and that you start out with 15- on your first turn, this means that the range of VP handed out spans two and a half magnitudes (!). Small errors in the beginning can be tremendously blown up: not a pattern I enjoy. But it will probably appeal to those who want to have their games go out with a Bang.

All in all a playable game, but not one I'm keen on revisiting any time soon. It would have gotten a 5 were it not for the uninspiring worker placement core, the weird scoring dynamics, and the atrocious rulebook (which I haven't even mentioned yet).

I love the way this game escalates. The game is tight and you have to pay attention to the other players strategies, whilst still be open in the approach you take. The key selling point is it is exceptionally well executed. The game has a great balance between short and long term, with the option to achieve consistent scoring throughout the game with more muted growth vs exponential growth. Each of these strategies are viable.

I've now played RR online enough that I feel comfortable rating it, and in fact I enjoyed it enough to buy it!

This is one of those games that could be perceived as multi-player solitaire, because you're trying to pick a strategy to focus on, and continually do what you can to get to that end.  The main competition is in the action spaces for your workers, which can get a bit more cutthroat as the game progresses.

What I like about this is the myriad scoring opportunities.  There's a lot to explore here, and repeated plays mean you'll likely be able to perfect your strategies.  It moves very quickly once you get the hang of it, and I can see my friends getting very absorbed in this interesting game.

This is a very cool point-salad Feld style game where no matter what you do the game rewards you in a way that feels neat and fulfilling (and you are always jealous of the rewards your opponents get).

Most commendable are the slick streamlined rules (which have very few exceptions or special things to remember) which together with what might be the best graphic design in a game I've ever seen make the game a breeze to teach (especially when compared to games of similar weight).

Sadly I never felt I was building railways in the two games - just placing workers to gain vp's.

RATING: 6
The workers placement mechanics seem completely copied from Lords of Waterdeep. On top of this the game add an extra strategic layer with the individual players board developments.

The result is a game less streamlined and thematic than LoW, but more complex/deep.

I really liked my first game (2 players) but the more I played it the more I had issues with the games:
- Victory points score exponentially as turns move on. this is not necessary a bad thing but here it is so extreme, that you can score more VP in the 7th and last turn than in all previous turns.
- This encourage choosing one strategy early on and sticking to it.
- Once each players have choose their "routes" to victory points. The workers placement core mechanisms, may result in more or less contested choices just based on those strategies.
- If you try to take another players desired action you'll loose a lot of potential point, compared to maximizing your own score. This is OK in a 2 players game, but with more, the others players will benefit more from you attempt to block someone than you.
- For a workers placement game, I felt that some choices were so automatic it almost reduced the decision to zero (same patterns appeared every turns) in the early placement rounds each turns while the final placement where not contested at all.
- Workers placement with limited game turns (7) is not so great.
- Some special actions(extra black worker) or engineers are very powerful and might affect balance.


Overall I had the feeling to be on "rails" from start to finish despite tactical decisions making.

Point salad, right up my alley! Found this on Yucata.de, though I'm fairly confident this will end up being a purchase before long. The railroad theme is quite thin; the rules and mechanics may as well be applied to cupcake making, but the options for point gathering are well-balanced, and everyone has the same options for play since everyone has their own tracks.

Interaction comes via the worker placement mechanic, which may disturb your decision tree as you would expect in a WP game. So I don't feel like I'm playing multi-player solitaire, but at the same time I don't feel like other people's plays are fully dictating my strategy, forcing me onto a specific track (see what I did there?)

If I had one thing to change, it would be to add the ability to use an opponent's purchased Engineers, at a cost of one coin.

While Russian Railroads (RR) doesn't do anything groundbreaking new and is at it's heart a worker placement game coupled with engine building, I do really like it. Although I'm normally not in the running for the win, I have a lot of fun optimizing my own play and discovering new tricks. I find it very satisfying to choose a strategy at the beginning of a game and trying to execute it as good as I can. The only downside I can see is that people could tend to choose the same strategy that worked for them over and over again, thus reducing the replayability a bit since plays could feel samey. But that isn't the failure of the game and I've yet to get to this point.

Maybe I'll change my rating at a later point in time, but until then Russian Railroads gets two thumbs up.

After playing Russian Railroads a lot over on [url=http://www.yucata.de]Yucata[/url], I have to lower my rating a little bit. The base game get's a little stale once you have seen and tried most of the strategies. It's still a nice worker placement game and the engine building is fun, it just isn't that exiciting anymore. Luckily, with German Railroads, there is at least one expansion (haven't tried American Railraods yet) that really takes the engine building to next level. Check out my comment and rating for the expansion if you're interested in what I think about it. Spoiler: It's great.

Lots of tough choices.  Enjoyed playing it.  I wonder about replayability.  I thought I had lost by a wide margin then came back strong in the last 2 turns and won by a such a wide margin it got me to thinking whether my strategy is the only strategy.  Need more plays.

Dropping from an 8 to a 6.  I just don't find this one to be all that fun.  The strategies are very limited and many times you must decide which to pursue very early.  And if too many others pursue the same strategy as you, it is often too late and/or costly to switch.  My interest in this one fell off very quickly after just a few plays.

Players are Russian railroad moguls, trying to milk the most victory points from the game as they develop three railroads, and the associated industry.

Standard worker placement fare, but from the wonderful publisher Hans im Glueck, so this one is worth a look.  We are at the meaty end of the spectrum here, as players acquire rail, trains and industry advancements to unlock bonuses on their private player board.  The key is to get a victory point generating engine up and running over the six or so turns in the game, and not be left behind.  Scores are totalled at the end of each round and added to the tally, and begin to escalate at an alarming rate.  

Lovely design - thinky, without overdoing it.  The presentation of the game, rules and components, is striking and first class.  No fluff here - no resources to collect and mince into other resources, no workers to feed - just collect the points.  Refreshing.

Excellent game.

There's a meaningless excalation of victory points, for me. Tried to change strategy while playing but was not such a good idea. It's hard to counterattack the overpower of leading player. Run till the end the longest railway with all the three materials and you'll probably have a strong chance to win.

Need more plays anyway

In the same way that Dominant Species taught me the ways that worker placement games can be amazing and unique, Russian Railroads taught me the ways that a worker placement came can be look amazing from the outset but ultimately be pretty standard.

While the points-game of Russian Railroads is where the buzz is at (clever play will exponentially explode your score gain each turn,) the actions just come across as yet-another-worker-placement-game. Certainly not a bad thing, but not worthy of massive praise either.

A solid worker-placement game but compared to similar games, there are a few issues I found.  

Like the German educational system, you basically have to pick your career path/track rather early on in the game before you really know what you are doing or what or want to do and stick to it right until the end; changing a strategy halfway through isn’t really an option.  

It is generally to the benefit of each player to take a different track/path so that they are not competing over resources.  This takes away from the very tension of most worker-placement games of trying to anticipate/bluff with other players to see who will snap up much needed resources first.  Basically, you pick a unique track/path and continuously place workers on the same spaces round after round to continuously to obtain all the resources you need and keep doing it until the end of the game with the hope that your path is more successful than anyone else’s path.  Thus, the game feels very scripted.  Some paths also do seem more convoluted than others, but apparently the designers of the game do say each track/path is a viable one to victory.  

Something that I'm not a fan of is that you can actively look though the special action cards and select the one that you want.  This stops the game dead-in-its-track (as players read through the rule book and debate which one to take), experienced players automatically know which cards to get which brings me to my third point: some special actions seem overpowered compared to others and feel unbalanced in the game.  This seems apparent in the run-away leader problems here as scores between players vary much more widely here than in similar worker placement games.  

Many people complain about Euro-games being dry, soulless and without theme; however while I almost always disagree with that statement (good mechanics in a game are always better than theme), "Russian Railroads" really is the poster-child for that criticism.  You basically take a spot so you can move a black cube to the right, so that you can later take a spot to move a brown cube, then a white cube, and that's basically it.  At no point do I feel this game has anything to do with railroads or building a railroad company.  And as for interaction: while I'm not a big proponent for mandated-interaction in games, this is one of the few games where we really all sat in complete silence as taking spots doesn't really interfere much with other players (see 'everyone takes their own unique path' statement above).  

While it is a solid and well thought-out game mechanically, I would recommend games such as Pillars of the Earth, Lords of Waterdeep, Lancaster, Agricola/Caverna over this one as they are more balanced, streamlined, interactive, thematic and engaging.   

As a lark, they should re-theme this game with Gymnasium, Realschule, and Hauptschule tracks.

A very enjoyable worker placement game.  Race to take options before they are taken by others.  Interesting mechanic for improving your track and scoring more points.  (Point scoring is a mixture of one time scores, end of game scores, and building an "engine" to score more and more end of round points each round.)

[b][FirstImpression22ndNOV2013][/b]One of the best crop of Spiel 2013. Played this a month after it's release (Spiel 2013) and I was spot on about me liking this game.

I like how pushing the rail works on your player board, and the use of trains (that has values on them) reminds me so much about 18xx (which is no surprise as the game was designed by 18xx fellas). The factory marker that serves as a bridge for your industry marker also pretty neat (there's a grove at the bottom of your player board which you can slide in a flipped train). All in all, in terms of function and design, they all worked perfectly.

In terms of gameplay, it's just a typical worker placement game where you send your worker(s) on the board and do the action immediately. Nothing so great about the part. But the decision and the action that you do onto your player board, to see how it all function and work are probably my favorite part. There are a lot to focus on, and choosing to focus in a certain area is probably the best choice.

In our first 4 players game, it took us nearly 2 hours, and that didn't include the explanation. The first 1-2 rounds of the game, players were still figuring out the available actions, 3-6 where it got more serious therefore were the most AP prone rounds, and the last round went very quickly as everyone knew what to do to maximize their points. 

I still think the Engineers are powerful and it is everyone's job to compete to get the engineers. Otherwise, 1-2 players will have too many engineers on their side and that will benefit them greatly (although the values on the engineers actually balance that out).

The point scoring in the game is nuts as they increase in folds, round after round. If your total points in a round is about the same as your previous round, then you know you're not doing so well. 

This is again, one of my favorite game from Spiel 2013. Believe the hype.

[b]Update[/b] Sold the game. After repeated plays, I've found a strategy that I like and proved to be a winning strategy for me against my opponent. My subsequent plays, and my stubbornness to experiment with new strategy proved to be an experience of boredom for myself.

I love it when you hear claims that a game is broken and that there is just one path to Victory, and then when you dig deeper you find that different people are claiming a different path. So don't believe it when someone tells you that Russian Railroads is a broken game. It is not. This is a real thinky worker placement game. If you are in the market for a more complex Stone Age, of perhaps near Tzolk'in complexity, then this could be the game for you. There is lots going on and it all moves along seamlessly with four distinct tracks available to gather rails or technologies for. I am definitely getting the impression that specialising in one is the way to go. Which is a shame as it is good to find a game where doing a bit of everything can reap as strong a reward as overt specialisation. Still, whilst not especially innovative, this is a good, solid, and worthwhile addition to my games collection. Perhaps my only reservation is that the last round is definitely one of points optimisation and so can slow down as AP sets in and people work out the best use of the final turn.

Wow, a worker placement game that isn't boring as hell.  This is an incredibly tight game and the best part about it is that you are managing your own stuff.  There is still competition for spaces, but you're not farming for resources like sticks and bricks - instead, almost every action you take advances your railroad industry or helps to facilitate it in the future.  It's really just a matter of who does it the most efficiently to maximize their VP generation each round.  Great game.

Russian Railroads is a very good worker placement game. It's a nice change that the worker actions in this one are building track, factories, etc. rather than the resource collection and utilisation found in Stone Age, Caylus, etc.  The choice of which track to focus in is important and difficult.  The game plays nice and quickly and it works really nicely with 2 players.

A really fantastic pure worker placement game. The multiple victory paths and the interesting build up of the scoring as the game progresses makes this a really fun game. I personally love how scores range between 250 - 400 points every game. The base game alone gets a tad stale after around 10 plays or so in my opinion. The German Railroads expansion helps with this and adds in more variety.

Second play and with a completely different strategy stranded only 10 points from the winner. This game definitely has multiple avenues to victory and it's going to be fun trying to explore them all. Got an idea for something different for the 3rd game in my head.

This is a good worker placement game that doesn't involve feeding your people. You are developing on 3 rail tracks and an industry track. Every game, you will have a different assortment of Engineers and there are various bonus cards and tiles that you can pursue based on your strategy. One thing I dislike is that it seems easy for someone to miscalculate their scores each round. You can slow the game down by everyone showing how they calculated their points so less mistakes happen, or everyone doing their own and not only risk mistakes, but not really understanding where they are getting their points. This is less of an issue when playing via yucata.de (an awesome digital implementation). I worry the various tracks are not evenly balanced which could lead to replay value issues, but the expansion addresses this issue. After the initial setup, there is virtually no luck in this game, which some will find appealing.

RATING: 8
This is one giant bottleneck puzzle. Identifying these bottlenecks in advance and capitalizing on those of your opponents is crucial. There is a constant struggle to keep the low scoring tracks pushing forward, to accommodate the higher scoring tracks, but without pushing your other tracks forward to capitalize on points you'll get left in the dust. The round end scoring is tedious, but it forces players to develop both long and short term strategies, so the game is less about high return on investment as it is about making several micro improvements every turn. The base game seems to be solvable, at least to a certain extent, but the German Railroads expansion blows that concern to smithereens. Also the length is perfectly calibrated for this game, and magnifies everything this game has going for it.

Ever get the itch to optimize a point engine?  This is the one for you.  The great thing is that you always maximize the point engine the same way.  No need to learn fresh new strategies.  Just do the same thing as last time.  I'm always sure to let people who appeared bored at the idea of maximizing a point engine know that this is a very thinky game.  A spectacular 5.

Point Salad euro. Good for what it is, it doesn't re-invent the genre so it won't change your mind about this kind of game if you don't like them already. Pretty standard worker placement to build your point-producing engine that just gets better and better each round. There are no catch up mechanisms, no punishment mechanisms. You just snowball your way to victory. There is no theme. You never feel like you're in Russia or building a railroad. Player interaction is minimal, the standard action denial of most worker placement games. There are a lot of components in this game which can be fiddly to set up and put away, similar to other euros like Puerto Rico or Castles of Burgundy. Component quality, graphic design, and art are all excellent. The decisions are engaging. The game moves pretty fast for it's weight. There are a lot of icons to learn about but they become intuitive quickly. Overall, a good heavier euro.

I'm glad I had the opportunity to play Russian Railroads, as the reviews I had read had sparked my interest. In practice, I found it to be a very workman-like worker placement game with a pasted-on railroad theme, wherein the primary form of competition is the standard limited number of spaces for workers (with the same three or four such spaces being claimed immediately each round). There are multiple tracks on which to push cubes (or collect tokens) to score points, but focusing on one or two leads to compounding (if not exponential) victory points, as long as the related actions don't see too much competition from other players. All in all, Russian Railroads feels very much like multiplayer solitaire/spreadsheets and not at all like a railroad game. It's a competent (and relatively heavy) worker placement game that I'd be willing to play again, but have no desire to own or recommend.

(Rating based on 110+ asynch online plays on Yucata.de [microbadge=19345])

The board game equivalent to a pinball table. You get points and bonuses for everything - and then some more. There's almost no theme, but the mechanics are intriguing enough on their own to carry this game.

It rewards multiple plays so if you play it for your first time, chances are you will get slaughtered. You need to at least know the basic strategies so you know what to do.

My favorite part of this game is that you have the ability to pull off some huge combos and monster turns. Especially when everybody has passed early and you can take multiple turns in a row.

The only downside is that the game can feel a bit samey when you've played it a bunch of times because there's not much variation in the setup. You have different engineers, but that's about it.

This is what one geekbud calls a "churn-and-burn" game in that you get through the arc of discovery and (relative) mastery pretty quickly. I see the appeal of trying to beat your high score while navigating the tight worker placement spaces the game presents, but after one play I can already see the end of the ride. 

The game is basically a dressed up spreadsheet where you claim cells before other players do so you can add up higher and higher amounts each turn. Each turn, more spreadsheet cells are up for competition. Any relation to railroads is strictly incidental. People who like heavy doses of incrementalism and positive feedback will be in heaven here; be wary of their ratings & comments unless you like that too.

I'll probably play again at the request of my group because I found the worker placement interesting. Among equally experienced players perhaps the competition for the 9-train and scoring in general makes for a compelling  experience. I can't help but feel like I've seen all there is after one game so it remains to be seen if trying to achieve higher and higher scores will hold my interest. I could see the game going up a point, but for now, I came in 2nd my first game at 344 and that feels like enough for me.

A worker placement with multiple avenues to victory.  We're ditching this one as it basically boils down to per turn math and knowing how to work a few of the rails well.  Unless you're interested in playing it over and over to work out that puzzle (and then after that what's the point?) I'd pass.  This feels like a game that I should just write a program and have it play the game for me.

Played twice : once at the Spiel'13 game fair and once at home, so rating might change in the future. Big up for the guys at the Z-man Games boot btw, for providing good explanation of this somewhat complex game, in the context of the Spiel, is somehing of an achievement. Really enjoyed both games, and want to play more. A first remark : there is absolutely no theme in this baroque worker-placement game, despite the great cover and the nice graphics. It is quite difficult to actually understand what on earth you might be doing by moving black, then grey, then brown, then natural, then white track pieces... on preexisting tracks (???). Nevertheless, the game is tense, very tense, without any downtime, every move is important. Some obvious strategic axes are detected by players in the first rounds (if not during the rules explanation), and all seem to work rather nicely. For instance, I won a game by maxim out my transsiberian and ignoring industries, and the other one by developing industries and maxing out the two "short" railways. Further, the game is nicely produced, with great components, in with beauty does not obfuscate function -a very important point in my eyes-. Further, while long, the rules are extremely clear.

From my inexperienced point of view, a few points might bother me in the long term :
- the game seem overly, or to be frank, artificially complicated. [Update: Does not really bug me after 2 games].
-I feel that some obligatory steps have to be taken by all players (maybe getting an extra worker and getting cards at least). [Update: getting last round scoring cards seems difficult to ignore. In our last game, I scored more than 60 pts -two end cards- in a game that was decided in 370 points, so 1/6 of my score came from the card and 5/6 from the 6 scoring phases (n.b: 3-player games last only 6 rounds)]. 
-I wonder how the number of players affects the overall balance of the game. [Update: 3-player games are just as tense as 4-player one. Still have to try the 2-players configuration]

Purest worker placement! A lot of strategy, planning and game vision are crucial to victory in this game with luck factor absent in game mechanics. We will build our railroads by allocating our workers in the basic actions available on the main board and in engineers who bring special actions. The development of the railways will release improvements and bonuses for the players. The game lasts several rounds, at the end of each one a score is made. In the first rounds there are few points and at the end of the last one, with the sum of the bonus cards, it is possible to double the score. A game with elastic scores in which a win by 20 points has been won in one detail and a big win can only be considered with more than 80 points difference! *** Best with 3 players ***

Up to a 10 after expansions. With the solo variant, RRR can be officially classified as an 1-4 plyaers game. "Emil" acts as a block-your-way computer and I think it does a fine job even in a 2 or 3 players game if you want some extra excitement on the board. The addition of coal brings more options to the table in helping to achieve your strategy.

With 2 players, while it looks like there are many viable paths to victory, the reality is quite different: the game is good at obfuscating which choices are best, but after a while you'll be able to evaluate every strategy's different growth curve and determine which is the best one. Done that, the game will become a battle of optimization between the two players, where all but one strategy are discarded. Or at least that's what I'm seeing. A possible way to fix it would be to find a better spot for the extra worker in the Vladivostok line, at the moment I believe it helps too much the strategy that is already giving the best returns.

For 3+ players the game might be better if the increased competition makes the not-too-good strategies viable.

A very solid, elegantly produced, tight worker placement game about building the Trans-Siberian railroad.  This is a game where you will only be able to do about half of what you'd like to as you move along up to 4 different progress "tracks" simultaneously. It feels a little more scripted than I was expecting, but the wealth of options that enable you to progress keeps it feeling tense and engaging. My only real con is the amount of math necessary to add up scores at the end of each round.  You start out getting a few points after the first round, but by the last you may be getting well over a hundred.  Don't let the somewhat pasted-on train theme scare you: if you like worker placement, you'll probably love this!

Juegazo de colocación de trabajadores que quizás innove poco pero que gusta muchísimo por su profundidad y múltiples caminos de victoria. Me encanta la sensación de ir haciendo crecer las vías y potenciando tus estrategias, aunque a cambio tenga que lidiar con la parte negativa del juego: el recuento de puntos cada ronda, que puede ser algo tedioso. Los componentes y la temática son una pasada. Lo jugaría muchísimo más a menudo si me dejaran.

RATING: 7
A fun worker placement game, where there really are many different paths to take to win.  My only possible concern is that buying engineers may be *too* important in the game, and if you can shut other people out and get the majority of engineers, you are much more likely to succeed, regardless of what strategy you take.  More plays are required to confirm this though.

Nem sok jóra számítottam azok alapján, amit hallottam róla. Ez részben be is jött, de részben meg tudott lepni a játék. 
Az biztos, hogy ez egy excel tábla. Három trekket tologatunk minden téma, ráció nélkül. Jó lett volna, ha legalább tényleg épülhetnének az a vonalak, és nem csak egyetlen síndarabot kéne előretolni. Szóval teljesen lélektelen darab.
Ami viszont meglepett, hogy a szabálya egyáltalán nem bonyolult. Kis túlzással egyszerűbben tanítható, mint egy 7 wonders. Ez mindenképpen kellemes hír, különösen, hogy azért elég komoly mélység van benne.
Ami viszont megintcsak nem annyira tetszett, hogy nem látom benne az újrajátszhatóságot. Félek, hogy minden party szinte teljesen ugyanolyan.

RATING: 6
Worker placement and engine building go together fairly often but rarely is the snowball effect more pronounced than in Russian Railroads.

Mechanically, the game offers nothing new, you've seen it all before. The execution is top-notch, though, straight-foward in both gameplay and design. It's a crowded genre but if you're still looking for a worker placement game and don't have an aversion to either trains or snowballs you can do a lot worse.

You should be aware, however, that you may feel a little railroaded by the game after a few runs. The game offers a few very clear-cut tracks to run on, and the challenge is solely in figuring out how to squeeze another point out of the available actions. Russian Railroads doesn't tolerate dithering or switching strategies mid-game. You've got to choose one lever and crank it hard. While that's okay for the first couple of plays it certainly becomes a little same-y after a while.

First multi-player game was really great. Took two hours from the start of the game. All three of us really, really liked it. It isn't so much a brain-burner, but it does take some time to think of your choice, especially when the persons before you take what you had planned to do. 

There are so many things you can do on a turn - build track (one or two, different colors); build a locomotive or a factory; advance on the industrial track; take a doubler, or take money, or take two temp workers; or do an engineers action, buy an engineer; or move up on the Turn order track. 

You will have from 5-8 or 10 actions you may take per turn depending on how many workers and how much money you have. 

There are tracks that give you bonuses as you advance along them. Their are locomotives that provide points based on where your track is laid. There are engineers that that give you special benefits. There are Factories you can build that can score points, or special bonuses. There are End Game Scoring Bonuses you can secretly obtain. The list goes on. So much happening.

Yet, the game flows so intuitively. The hardest part to grasp is how to score. 

A great, great game! I really like it.

Russian Railroads starts off in the stratosphere: excellent rulebook, well-designed components and graphic design, and a scoring mechanism (involving moving pieces of "track") that I haven't seen anywhere else and I found highly interesting.  I was very much thinking this an '8' game after the first two rounds.  But by half the game, it begins to feel repetitive, the mini-maxing increases to a point that becomes irritating, and the runaway leader problem starts to rear its ugly head - and there's still half of a game to go!  I definitely liked it all the way through, but by the last couple rounds I was sort of ready for it to end.  Rarely have my expectations built so highly at the start of a game and become rather deflated by the end.  Still, I rate this game a '7' for its interesting scoring mechanic - while though mathy and abstracted from the theme - is unique and should be noted.  But there is definitely a feeling of the game running away from itself by the end.  The compounding score "thing" feels a little ridiculous and I wish there was some mechanic which would have curbed it. So- good game, but not consistently intriguing to really make it stand out from all the other excellent worker placement games out there.

Very excited to get this to the table. I'm a little leery of all the math that's required every single round, but from all the reviews I've read it seems to be worth it.

--
Got this played at board game night and greatly enjoyed myself. The math is present, about on the same level as Power Grid but never interfering with the gameplay, only adding an aspect of optimization to the later turns of the game. I would love to get this to the table more often, it's as straightforward as they come, but with multiple paths to victory it doesn't seem like it will wear out any time soon.

Worker placement game to get a victory point engine going. But the theme is lacking and confusing. What are those colored rail pieces for? Am I building better tracks out of Moscow when I move the grey and brown pieces? I already built the track, certainly there can't be 5 different qualities of track in real-life that I keep re-building.

So, not much theme, just a point generator game. Which is not that interesting, but it's serviceable. I do wish the points were all dropped by a factor of ten. It's silly to  have to fart around with a point here and a point there, when final scores are 300-400.

Although the theme is a bit pasted on, the game is really awesome.

You feel it? That's the weight of a box filled with awesome components, a lot of which are wooden.

Excellent worker placement strategic game. Great theme, excellent components and simple, yet very deep game play. In Russian Railroads there are many ways to score victory points together game engine building and tough worker placement decisions, which all make this game one of the best worker placement games I have played. Heavy competition for all good places to place workers. Engineers are great, but not overpowered. Everything seems to be so smooth and balanced in this game. Scoring is mathy in way that many different points are accumulating, but that makes this game great, because you can always find interesting way to score points.
Theme exists in game, however thematically this game is made from railway building manager desk perspective. This game is not about building railway actually as you see it, but as an manager you hire engineers, plan and give orders.

Personal: as a Worker Placement game is great, the rules are quite easy, but you need more than one play to get the real game. Although you see the trains, you have to abstract yourself from that, place your workers, do the action score points, sounds easy. Best I can say is that you can follow any strategy you foresee in the game, as all of them have their option to win (1st railroad, industry, 3rd one...) It has become one of my favorites

Another uncreative worker placement game. Yuck! Why can't people come up with new game mechanics instead of just copying other's? :(

Anyways, the game is playable, has some fun into it, but misses that little thing that would make you buy it I think. 

It really doesn't feel like a train game, it might just have been a walk in the park game, or car game, or plane game, or even a space race game. The game has no personality or theme that matches its mechanics. So, no flavor. I think it's just a game about making crappy victory points (yes again, another game with victory points) and lots of them, period! Nothing else interesting in this game

I wouldn't spend more than 5$ on that one.

I love this game, so many options but the victory point paths are highly transparent. That is, there's no esoteric convert resource X->Y->Z->points as in Rosenberg games (which I love) so strategy becomes more important. The game is indirectly interactive in the way worker placement games tend to be, but here the number of "good" actions is highly limited so it's more intense. 

Probably a game I will keep in my "always play" stack with Castles, Puerto Rico, Ora, etc.

UPDATE: After 7 plays, I still love this game and always want to play it! I'm seeing some of the more strategic points (not every engineer is worth hiring even for the 40 point bonus, for example, and countering at least one opponent's strategy is important). Fantastic game.

Preliminary rating after first full game.  Based on the fun I had I'd rate it a '9' though.

Old meets new, i.e. worker placement combined with a number of fresh ideas. I especially like the various ways to score points, the idea of having several scoring tokens on one scoring track and the avalanche of points in the last two rounds which give the game a nice feeling of a (positive) chain reaction.  

Be aware though: this is a completely abstract game which is very different from all those 18xx-style games designed by the authors.

Will definitely play this again. Final rating will depend on how well the different strategies are balanced.

Edit:
Raised rating to 9 after 10+ games. Feels fresh every time.  Excellent play value with any number of players from 2 to 4.

RATING: 3.5
The core mechanic is bland worker placement, wrapped in a ridiculously convoluted scoring system - which is triggered at the end of every round. You can move 3 to 5 markers with different values in each of 3 different tracks, build factories in yet another track, get locomotives and hire engineers. If you reach certain points in your tracks with a specific marker, you can unlock other markers, gain new workers, get bonus points or choose among 7 bonus chips with varied effects. And all of this is completely abstract.

I admit the game works. There are various strategic paths and no randomness after setup. But having played it just once, I have no idea if it's balanced, and considering how dry the experience was, it's unlikely that I will ever find out. It's simply one of those spreadsheet efficiency exercises without any semblance of fun.

Given, this is a good game, but it's just the same old stuff. Place workers, block others and make points in xy different ways. This is really the opposite of innovation. I do miss interaction, as it's too easy to just play your game in a very straight way.

After more plays, it's still fun to plan ahead and all, but it lacks interaction that is needed to force the players to some more tactical moves. As it is now, you can simply go your way, no matter what.

Using industry is the most fun you can get in this game, as there are different possibilities, while all other strategys are set in stone. Not to mention that there are only a few viable strategys available, which is bad for the replayability.

Also, Saint Petersburg is by far the worst track. Yes, you can get 2 very useful and strong "?" markers there, but that's all the track has to offer. They could have ended the track right there, as it's a waste of time to spend anything else there. This gives the game a bad aftertaste.

More plays confirmed my guess about the replayability. There are only 3 strategys and one of them does "always" grand you the 1st or 2nd place.

Joc de col·locació de treballadors, té diferents estrategies, però totes molt relacionades entre si. La puntuació es fa torn a torn i no hi un únic camí per fer punts.

Opinió després de més partides: Molt més estratègic que tàctic, però en el fons, no té tantes estrategies possibles: o vas al Transiberia, o a la medalla de Kiev... Les partides es repeteixen bastant. No em negaria a jugarlo, però ha estat una petita decepció el tema de la rejugabilitat.

Very enjoyable and meaty worker placement game. So far games have been interesting and I'm really eager to play more of this. I can see the game becoming samey because the only randomness in the setup comes from the engineers. But that has not happened yet. Theme is paper thin but I like it. I have the Russian edition so the box looks cooler. My favorite worker placement at the moment dethroning Caverna (23.1.17)

RATING: 6.5
I love euros, and this one has enjoyable worker placement and lots of tough choices and trade-offs. But, for me, it was just too mechanical/mathematical. I think it also suffers from a lack of variability and replayability. Each game, you simply go through the motions, with a few dominant strategies emerging for experienced players. That often results in runaway leaders, which can really drain the game (indeed, any game). Not a bad game by any means, but one that will frequently lose to other options in my collection.

While there is nothing that is new here, this game does what it does relatively well. And what is it that this game does? Carefully blends the euro-tropes of new (e.g., worker placement) and old (e.g., resource conversion) into something that still feels relatively fresh. While the lack of actual train connections (say on a map) makes the link to the theme a bit tenuous at best, the game still provides an interesting mechanical structure within which to compete with other "railroad" barons. This game, like many of its brethren, encourages specialization (through and with an economic snowball) -- however, with only one play, I am curious as to whether the multiple paths to victory are relatively similarly weighted or if they are supposed to  balance out through competition for positions.
Overall, good but not great.

A really good game, but I have to say, that I think just is a little too much to keep track of. The basic structure of the game if very well done, but all the "tacked on" stuff, like the end-game cards for example, make it just a bit too fiddly and conveluted. I'm lowering my rating to a 7. Have both big expansions for the game (German and American), and German is n my opinion the best way to play, even if it actually makes the game even more conveluted
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not bad, for worker placement. What you are trying to accomplish is to move up 4 different tracks, which provide bonuses, points, or both. It's not as elegant as games of yore but at least it all hangs together in a relatively coherent whole. The high scores are exciting, even if the scoring rules are a bit byzantine. I am hard-pressed to understand how this theme relates to these mechanics, but whatever. It's enjoyable for advanced Euro players (and probably nobody else).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not very impressed. It is okay but mostly a multiplayer solitaire. Now don't get me wrong I am a eurogamer and I love indirect player interactions but this one just feels flat. The game creates little to no tension because a) the strategies are so independent to each other (3 different rails + 1 industry track) which makes blocking not rewarding; and b)the game system does not bear any excitment or clever maneuver possibility so the gameplay is kinda boring。

Moreover, the heaviness of the game comes largely from the sheer amount of rules rather than cleverly designed mechanisms.

Oh and personally I think the rulebook is TERRIBLE. It does make the rules "easy to understand", but to a certain extent it's like reading "layman's guide to antitrust law" - sure after reading that you'll probably understand the very basic ins and outs of this specific legal field but you are far from mastering the subject. I found myself needing to reference back to the rulebook much more often than other games of the same weight while I was playing the game. In summary, the rulebook sacrifices logical structure for the sake of "being easy to undersand"

2 - 4 players

I enjoy this worker placement game so far and have not exactly seen a dominant strategy yet other than do what other people are not doing.  Even if I end up losing I have fun building up whatever I have chosen to do.  Sometimes it does seem like you are forced into certain strategies though.  I usually like to build up the Trans-Siberian line as much as possible but there have been times where I'm pushed toward doing industry.  There is more competition in a 4 player game but I think I might prefer 2 or 3 players just so the game is shorter.

Brilliant, I'd need to play over and over to establish how balanced the different strategies are but the premise behind it all is fantastic :)

Ok so I'm now 5/6 plays in and I'm downgrading this to 7. It's good but there's nothing even close to being revolutionary. It's also not as diverse as I first thought - the primary strategy is to advance the white track and get the x2 multipliers out, but if more than one players go for it then they will both lose.

The expansion seems to make both boards more replayable but I'd still rather play something else

---

Downgrading it to 5. Played loads on BGA now and there's a definite alpha strategy. Just rush for the 9 loco advantage and then push all your energies into Kiev and Industry. Simples. Broken.

(05/11/2014) Comment based on 4 plays.

An interesting twist on worker placement, with a somewhat well integrated railroad theme. However, it is not a route network building game.

On my first play, this seemed like "Just Another Soulless Euro" worker placement. Each player gets five/six workers, just like in Stone Age, and there are a myriad of action spaces that are on a first-come, first-served basis. There seemed to be clearly two obvious paths to victory. Either: 1) Build the Trans-Siberian Railway (the top track), or 2) Build a bunch of industry (along the bottom track). However, whoever can leverage one of the two middle tracks along with one of these strategies will likely win.

Re-playability seemed questionable at first, since there are only two likely paths to victory. However, it seems that the character of every game will be determined by the random assortment of engineers that will come out each game. There is also the hidden element of some end-of-game victory cards not being available. Still, after four plays, the game starts to feel same-y.

It is unlikely that a player will win with a "balanced" approach, making progress along all four tracks, because it is simply not possible, given the limited action spaces and limited turns. Thus, there seems to be issues with player count. With three, two players will go for one of the two paths, while leaving the third player free to maximize and win with the other path. With four, two will go for the top, while the other two will go for the bottom. At that point, it is a matter of the player that best strings together actions and benefits together to maximize play. 

The theme drips with pre-Soviet Russia, yet there really is no feeling of building a railroad or network. There is the innovative mechanism of having five different "rail tokens" inch-worming across the top track, as it is a race to see if one can build from Moscow to Vladivostok, but beyond that, it is a matter of grabbing action spaces before others do.

The components are very good, and there are lots and lots of bits, which will make any Euro-fan happy. The rules are very well written, too, with most corner cases covered. Play is smooth and fast, with very little down time. If you want a worker placement, that has a lot of bells and whistles, that forces you to optimize and jump through a lot of hoops, then this Euro is for you. Personally, I don't find this design that interesting. It is a solid "7".

(05/17/2014) Update after 5 plays. Someone in our group finally broke 400 VP! It is possible to complete all three of the upper tracks, and half-way through the bottom industry track. Groupthink thought this was impossible--either chose the upper or lower track, with some leveraging in the middle two tracks. The lower industry-only strategy garners huge number of VP early on, enough to discourage the players pursuing the top-track strategy, but the top-track strategy eventually catches up, and exceeds the industry-only strategy, with VP ranging from 125-145 VP, compared to 55-85 VP. There's plenty of interesting, non-linear decisions to be made for a 2-hour game. Still not convinced this is a great game; it is a solidly "good" game.

(12/06/2014) Update after 8 plays. The group appeal is wearing off, finally--I'd been quietly putting up with this design for months. I claimed early on that there were only a few paths to victory, but a few people claimed there were still lots of choices to explore, so I reluctantly went along, although I could not articulate it.

Then, BGG User [user=qwertymartin]qwertymartin[/user] summarized it most eloquently here in his [blogpost=36394]blog[/blogpost]:

[i]A game of choosing one of (at best) a handful of baked-in paths at the outset and spending the rest of the game executing it as efficiently as you possibly can. Player interaction consists of being aware of the furrows the other players are ploughing so that you can identify the 'hot zones' on the shared worker placement board that you need to prioritize.[/i]

I couldn't have said it any better. It is not very satisfying when all you're doing is quickly select, and then build on a chosen path as efficiently as possible.

I like heavy euros and do not mind if they are abstract and dry. Somehow I did not like the very abstract feel this game had. Additionally I did not get a good overview about how to score points efficiently until the end of the game. And there are a lot of points to score all the time.

Since I have only played once my rating is to be taken with a grain of salt.

Finally, a worker placement game that I enjoy!  The theme is irrelevant, and the object is to build an effective points generating engine as efficiently as possible.  It is possible to follow a strategy from start to finish, although your opponents' actions may well force you to change tack.

A year down the line and this game is just as engaging as ever.  The decisions are superb fun despite being entirely abstract.  It plays very well online too, because it rewards careful consideration of the options.

This is "Agricola on tracks". Low interaction (apart from picking actions before others do), but high complexity and interwovenness. And the player sheet (rails and industry, not food and animals) grows and develops in front of you. 

But the in-game scoring? Oh, this one goes to eleven! Meaning way to high up. Normal end scoring would be around 300-400 points - on a 100p track. So theres one little minus. Apart from that, its a lovely complex game.

Fun "puzzle" type optimization game.  It works very well as a solo game (with the German expansion) because of that puzzle feeling.  You are only competing with other players to get the spaces you need to optimize your board.  The person who optimizes best, wins the game.  This game works very well and has a satisfying feeling.  Lots of fun!  Try it as a solo game with the German expansion.

Worker placement games aren't normally my favourite genre, but I found this game very enjoyable, if lacking the fun theme of Caverna. It's all rather abstract, I can't fathom what the black-grey-brown-natural-white track upgrade sequence represents in thematic terms, but there are plenty of action choices on each turn. Two problems: the first is that there are only 2 viable strategies: Kiev with Medal and Industry. I've won with both, but without the right engineers in the game the Trans-Siberian just isn't competitive. Second, the game's a snowball, you can tell who's in contention after just a couple of rounds. I really want to like this, but it falls into the 'so nearly' camp for me, I love the theme but little balances just aren't there. This is still among the best games from Essen 2013, but in my group it went off the rails after just a few plays.

A worker placement game, similar to Agricola but not quite such a brain burner. I can see it getting repetitive after many plays but we haven't reached that point and the expansion (german railroads) makes it lots more complicated if you want that option.

There is a lack of theme but I really like how the victory points grow exponentially, our games have been close and we've no idea who's won until the end.

New hotness, but probably justly so. I like the worker placement with differentiated costs (1 worker for some actions, 2-3 for others). You need to make an early decision about which railroads are important. I like the little bonuses and the many steps that you have to consider when advancing your railroads.  The engineers are a little frustrating because they make turn order more important than I want it to be. (2 plays)

I play this on BGA quite a bit.  I love worker placement games, and this is a pretty fun one, but I don't like that there is so little variability from game to game.  It's more about tackling what strategy you want to use than analyzing that specific game setup and trying to best your opponents against it.  About 10 games in, it is getting pretty stale.  Would always be willing to play if someone requests it, but I doubt I'd ask for it to be played.

As rahdo has described, this gives a sense of escalation. While the theme is admittedly dry and there is little luck involved, but my wife and I like to compare it to a train ride that is going faster every round, giving you a sense of accomplishment for being the most efficient engine builder. 

The lack of theme may prove a steep learning curve but once you grasps the whole scoring mechanism, then you will be able to start building your engine.

I think having a persistent point scoring engine is actually something new to us and we definitely enjoy pulling off combos during the game. The only thing that prevents this game from going to a 10 is that you can only do 4 players but admittedly most euros cannot go more than 4 players without feeling too long and possibly disengaging. Still a 9 despite that.

Really nice worker placement.  Very slick mechanics that make you grind for points in many different ways (following through on a strategy can be difficult when you get blocked but allows flexibility to pursue other paths (sticking to a particular path and building it up in the most concise manner is the tactic to follow, which can be hard to do as you get distracted by other easy points just within reach).

Loose thoughts:
- Seems to emphasize forward planning a lot. Having a game plan can really help you out.
- Turn order and roubles interact in an interesting way. Spending your last rouble doesn't necessarily help you, but if someone else is in front of you with cash on hand, it gives them a big leg up to know when they have to take certain actions.
- Focus on figuring out what actions other players cannot get a benefit out of right now. There's no point in taking a non-contested action early if there's a chance you can wheel it back to your next turn.
- Seems kind of like Agricola, in that early games of players tend to look very different, while late games tend to standardize a bit. Not as pronounced, but notable. Will be interesting to see if any wild strategies start to spring up.

Based on train theme, Russian RailRoads is combined worker placement as a main mechanic. Unlike the game name of Russian Railroads, the game is not a classic train game, but actually a worker placement game. This game has a lot of advantages to attract gamers. First, the game provides easy-to-understand rules, so that players can enjoy smooth progress of game from the game beginning to the end. Second, the game has successfully shortend long train game such as 18xx games without removing fun and theme. Surely, Russian RailRoads is one of the best games issued in 2013. Though, it is quite sad that Russian RailRoads has not overcome the limit of worker placement system. It has only increased the list of worker placement games. When I assume the game without the train theme, the game is just a normal worker placement game. On the one way, as a worker placement game, Russian Railroads is surely a wonderful game. On the other way, Russian Railroads has remained a sense of frustration while I am considering the game as train games. After couple of plays, I've discovered certain repetitive play patterns by game participants. The first move of the first player is usually settled to the Engineers action. Because the Engineers action provides personal action choice and big scores at the end, the first move is quite limited. I doubt this kind of so-called standardized patterns easily lower the game value.

A real "real get richer" game, in which the leader will steam ahead (get it?) leaving the other players in the dirt. Played this a handful of times and every time the winner has been painfully obvious very early on - not a lot of fun when the game is relatively long.

I like the determinism of worker placement games. They are simple and deep without having to resort to shallow theatrics and dramatic mechanisms, but instead favor subtle interactive tensions created by evolving strategic landscapes due to opponents' tactics. They are the mental equivalent of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FflIMq-ZCIw&feature=youtu.bejt8Q3FW6ZA]Tai Chi[/url]

I generally enjoy games which others would consider dry and boring.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I really do not enjoy this game.  I may be overlooking something, but I just do not find the decisions in this game to be interesting.  Moreover, a main part of the game is moving tokens (i.e, track and industry markers) up their respective tracks.  It's simply hard to get excited about any turns in this game.  Woot! I got to the White track space before you and pushed the white track marker two spaces head.  Take that!

Other games have tracks where you essentially push markers ahead on tracks which I do enjoy (e.g., Goa, Endeavor, Hansa Teutonica).  I think the big difference is that in those other games, I get a sense (perhaps wrongly) that I'm accomplishing things other than simply moving markers up their respective tracks.  In other words, there seems to a be a bigger separation between the actions and the tracks.  Though I'll admit that such separation is fairly lacking in Goa.

RATING: 6.5
There seem to only be two strategies, but they're fun strategies and implementing them will look different enough from game to game that it doesn't seem to be a problem. Mostly the best thing about this game is seeing my point generation go up steadily. I generally feel like a bit of a loser if on the last turn I don't get at least 100 points from my board. It probably says something bad about my psychology that that's so satisfying.

Update: bumped down to 7 since I'm much less excited to play this game again as it generally feels like there are few decision points after you pick you main strategy (from a list of two strategies - though I've been told there might really be three).

Probably the most streamlined of any worker placement game I've played in a while. I like how the actions integrate with each other and the tension for getting what you want when you want it.

However, it really needs a map. Railroads need to be contested. While I can see why game-wise that each player is working on the same railroads independently (on each player's own mat), I can't get over the illogical nature.

In our game, too many ways to score led to everyone being at about the same score at game's end. There was some degree of screw-age in the action-taking round there just wasn't enough of it overall. I didn't feel enough "uh oh"s, because usually there were multiple good things I could do and I was pretty sure my opponents didn't want the things I wanted. We were all scoring.

How to be competitive in your first game: Figure out what everyone else is planning and pursue your own unique strategy relentlessly. If everyone is ignoring doublers, get the doublers every turn and max out your top rail--get the track value upgrader ?-thingy. With the big White track 5+ deep on all doublers, you will rack up the points. Try to keep a coin in reserve in case you get a crack at those engineer guys at the bottom of the board.

With the way you score VP's every round just building on top of the base you set the previous round(s) it could have a problem with runaway leader.  First play was fun though, and do want to play again... but also wonder if reply-ability will suffer once certain best strategies are known.

Original comment: I like dry games, but WOW this is a themeless pile of mechanics. All of the separate tracks don't feel like they are part of the same overall system. Even the guy that won was just like "ok... I have more numbers. Next game"

Update: I've played this more now, and I really like it. It's still utterly themeless, but the snowballing nature of the game makes it extremely interesting. It's easy to get behind, but it's still enjoyable to try to dig yourself back out. The learning curve is basically vertical, but once you hear all the rules, it plays very smoothly.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (July 2014)

WOW what a great strategy game! I don’t particularly like the theme (and I didn’t feel it when playing the game) but the game itself is very good. Russian Railroads is a medium weight, worker placement game.

It has a lot of rules, but they are easy to grasp. Besides the game has a great graphic design making easy to explain the rules. The game components and art are also good. It has a satisfying depth and the decisions are very interesting (which action to use, should I use a worker or a coin?) and in no way obvious. You have too few workers to do all the things you want to do. The playtime isn’t that long for a game with such strategy and depth, a huge plus for me. It has a very low luck factor as everything is known from the beginning.

At first blush the game seems to have many paths to victory, but I’m a bit worried that the Trans-Siberian track is very powerful/unbalanced because it is the one that gives you the more valuable (colored) tracks. Also it seems you have to stick with your strategy if you want a big VP payoff so the winner of the game can be decided some turns earlier. The engineers by themselves aren’t that powerful BUT if you get a lot of engineers and score them via industry they can generate A LOT of VPs, that also feels unbalanced. There are almost no player interaction, this isn’t bad for me but I know it bothers some people. 

Bottom line, Russian Railroads is a solid Worker Placement game. I want to play it a lot more. I need to review if the game has multiple ways to win or not. I think I will buy it in the future.

I finally played with the expansion Russian Railroads: German Railroads and I like the game a lot more with it! It fixes the static and replayability issues for me. 

On the other hand, I´m happy to report that I have seen players win with strategies different than the Trans-Siberian track, so my appreciation for the game has increased a bit as well.

Good rail road building game.  Solid elegant design. My only concerns so far are that openings seem scripted - go for enginers, coins, then black rail movement.  Also to do well against experienced players the game forces you to chose a path from round 1 and follow through - and there are really only a set number of paths that can score competitively with experienced players. I think the expansions may fix some of these concerns but i cannot confirm.

Russian Railroads doesn't do much that is new but executes extremely well.  Despite the train theme, RR is NOT a "train game" in the tradition of the 18xx family or the Winsome series.  It is a worker-placement action drafting game.

Probably the game's greatest innovation is its scoring system which relies on multiple different types of "track" on three different routes.  The five different track types have different actions during the action draft, rewarding players who unlock higher level track early as they have little competition for the high level track actions.

I am certain to enjoy this title for at least 5 plays; my concern is that there isn't enough replayability here (only in the conductor draws) to get to the 10-20 play level.

I originally gave this game a rating of 8 after one play.  On subsequent plays, I've found that there are a couple of minor flaws that take away some of the enjoyment of the game.

Early worker placement seems to follow a pattern, and the game is VERY unforgiving.  If a player falls behind in victory points early, they are pretty much out of the game unless the other players make stupid mistakes (not likely).  

There are ways to gain big points at the end of the game to boost a player who is trailing, but with careful play by other players this will probably never happen.  A bit more randomness is needed to keep the scoring tight.  As it is, the game is just an excercise in optimising moves to maximise points... not very much fun.

The train theme, which really doesn't mean much, gives it a little bump in my rating... which is now a 6.

I didn't expect to like Russian Railroads. I mean, it looked like it would be fine, but it didn't look special at all. It looked like one of those games that brings nothing new to the table, but just does what it does well. And I guess that's pretty much true, but I've really enjoyed my plays so far. I'm still figuring out scoring and strategies, but this went from "meh, it looks okay" to "yeah, I'll probably pick it up".

RATING: 7.5
Nice medium/heavy worker placement. On first play I'd rate this game a solid 8, but it seems there is a limited diversity in optimal strategies, so the lack of re-playability prevents a higher mark. The snowball effect in point accumulation can cause a problem in catching up the leader. Game requires some arithmetics after each round, but nothing really cumbersome. All in all, a solid thinky WP, but one that just misses that little extra 'thing' to really excite me.

Wow. This is an impressive mix of worker-placement and medium-weight railroading. Not an economic game, income comes in the form of points, and the scores can run VERY high by game's end. This scratches two of my favorite itches in one box and I look forward to keeping this and playing it quite a bit. 

There are some fresh mechanics here that are not that difficult to grasp. In most railroad games you upgrade your engines and extend your railroad. This abstracts the extension part and puts the focus on upgrading. You upgrade not only locomotives, but also track and industrialization - and you can get specialty engineers that give you unique actions you can perform. I do think that both railroaders and pure eurogamers will find a lot here to enjoy. My rating could easily rise to a 9....

This is a really great worker placement game in which you are trying to build up to three railroads and an industry track. The three tracks offer different ways of scoring points including. The industry tiles give special actions. There are also special spaces on each track that when reached give very big bonuses. Points rapidly increase at the end of the game. I do worry a little from my few plays that the path to victory may require only one specific strategy. Still it is a fun game.

First impressions; it seems that there are many different viable strategies to this game, that continued plays would present more and more interesting ways to play.

Furthermore the scoring after each round slowly builds steam - pun intended - so it feels like round after round your points are compounded based on the events of the preceding round.

A strategic worker placement game that has to be learned. Enough depth that an experienced player likely will thrash newbies, lots of elements that need some time to be explained and will fend off all but seasoned gamers. Nonetheless, all elements come together logically and once explained few questions are left.
Discussions show that there are a few strong strategies that need to be countered actively or otherwise a clear victory will happen. The good thing is that there's not a single superior strategy.
Objectively, this is a really strong mid/heavy Euro. In principle, I like it. In fact, my personal enjoyment hinges deeply on playing successfully and as this is one of the strategic games where I usually suck and need a lot of practice to be halfway competitive, I can't rate it higher than a 7 for now.

A competently done but very vanilla worker placement game. The economic engine is interesting, unique, and multi-dimensioned. (Or maybe it's not even an economic engine - there's no exponential resource growth, just varying allocations of a static resource pool). I'm somewhat tempted to puzzle out good build paths as a solitaire exercise, which is a reaction only a few games with particularly well built engines have managed to elicit (think Homesteaders or Roads and Boats). 

The problem is that the core gameplay and interaction mechanisms are completely stale at this point. Just dealing with a different set of resources is not enough to make the gameplay interesting outside of the solitaire puzzle. If you haven't played too many worker placement games, this is probably a great one to start with. 

Also, it's pretty impossible to see even a hint of the supposed 18xx heritage here. So anyone expecting something like that will be disappointed, this is pure eurogame to the core.

After reading the rules, I expected this to be a slow brain-burner, and sort of didn't want to play. Putting it on the table and going through all the steps, I found that it had "gears" that once set in motion meshed quite nicely and I enjoyed it. It really doesn't have a lot of downtime once everyone knows how to play and thematic elements made sense. I will say that this is NOT a gateway Euro. People pretty new to the hobby will find this perplexing if someone doesn't teach them. For experienced players, the challenges and rewards are here and the mechanisms do offer something new.

RATING: 8
I like this game, but I have a feeling that it might be nearly "solved."  I thought the trans-Siberian might be dominant, but I was beaten by the Kiev/factory strategy when the third player also went for the trans-Siberian.  I think it was due to the lack of competition in the factories rather than competition in the trans-Siberian.

The problem lies in that to execute the trans-Siberian requires a full commitment for the whole game or it won't be effective.  So the game might come down to which strategies people commit to at the beginning of the game.  The person with the least competition wins.

Fortunately, I like playing this game to see if my theory holds.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find opponents that are at the same level of experience.

J'ai gagné avec la piste mauve mais il a vraiment fallu que je mette tous mes oeufs dans ce panier: à tous les tours j'ai essayé d'avoir la case qui donne des sous (pour acheter l'ingénieur) et la case qui met 1er joueur afin d'être le premier pour acheter l'ingénieur. Ce qui fait que j'ai eu 4 ingénieurs, dont deux valaient plus de 10 points (total 31 ensemble). Après il a fallu que je prenne les 3 bonus qui donnent un point par valeur d'ingénieur (j'ai été chanceux de les avoir), et j'ai attendu à l'avant dernier tour pour activer 2 fois le bonus (avancé le pion mauve de 3 cases) pendant que j'avais 4 ingénieurs pour une valeur de 31x2, puis au dernier tour j'ai réussi à le refaire, pour un autre 31 points. Je doute que ce soit possible à reproduire...

Beaucoup de façons de faire des points et beaucoup de chemins différents dans ce jeu. Bien calibré. Le jeu pardonne un peu, vu qu'on a au moins 6 actions par tour, on peut se tromper de temps en temps. Et il y a plusieurs options pour faire la plupart des actions (comme avancer le rail noir), c'est juste que certaines sont plus coûteuses, mais au moins tu peux la faire.

Par contre, vraiment pas de sentiment "d'accomplir" quelque chose ou d'être dans un thème. On fait des points pour faire des points. Un excellent worker placement très bien calibré et qui pardonne, mais il manque un petit quelque chose pour qu'il se démarque, que je puisse dire qu'il a un quelque chose de spécial qui me convainque de l'acheter parce qu'il est différent des dizaines de jeux de worker placement que j'ai déjà...7/10.

A very compact and polished, but at the same time somewhat typical blocking worker placement offering with many possible strategic routes for victory and heavily snowballing VP generation. There's a feeling of bland Feldian point salad in here. What makes this special is the track development part happening on your own player board that opens up new actions and scoring opportunities for you during the game. Player interaction is mainly in the worker placement department and there's a bit of variability in setup to create replayability.

Very, very impressive game. Fantastic worker placement machine. There's a lot going on and, although player interaction is low, you have to keep a close eye on what your opponents are doing.

The track system is such a brilliant mechanic, plus it leads to short term objectives which are part of the bigger pictures, some HUGE turns, and many different strategies. This is an incredible game, and it's made even better with the expansion.

Love the game but IMO it's somewhat broken.  The Vladivostok/White track strategy always works, unless other players block it.  To me that's broken.

When I saw it at Spiel '13 the theme made it an immediate pass for me.

Later I played it and realized... that the theme is as irrevelant as it gets. And that the worker placement game beneath it is exceptionally good. Love the snowball-effect-escalation of the game.

RATING: 5
Russian Railroads is an elaborate, nonspatial, luckless, themeless (or with a failed theme, take your pick) action drafting game where the game state progresses on separate player boards and interaction happens while drafting for turn order, minor bonuses, actions, and various types of more or less exclusive features. There are only two currencies, refreshing and non-refreshing workers, which are used to pay the variable costs of the action draft. Most actions serve to push markers up four victory point income tracks. Just so no one should think the game isn't very elaborate, the income tracks are variously draped with tinsel of all sorts: tinsel that launches additional markers, tinsel that makes markers pay off more, tinsel that makes tracks pay off more, tinsel that gives one-time currency, action or point payoffs, tinsel that enables or completes the tracks, tinsel that gives you more tinsel, and so on. You win by sticking with a "path to victory", maintaining action efficiency and not having another player trying to hog your spots.

I've seen this described as an 18XX, which obviously couldn't be further from the truth, and as a cube pusher, which is still a bit off. Certainly there's a tangible flavour of "you can get three lemons and one banana for one coconut, or you can get one lemon and one cantaloupe for two coconuts", but as mentioned there's not a lot of currencies to grind through gears of transformation and not so much in the way of setting up feedback loops. It's more of a pure spreadsheet optimization, embodied by a multiplicity of arbitrary additions and multiplications on the individual income tracks. Player differentiation is forced by incidental means, there is no actual shared economy. It's really a simple idea - push those markers to get that income - decked out with a whole lot of tinsel and prize blocks for players to periodically bump for rewards. And it's not what I feel I need more of in my gaming.

This is a solo rating, to be taken with the customary number of salt grains.

Nice economic game. I must confess that I quite enjoyed it, it's mechanics are clever. However I am lacking any real theme. Because your actions are not so greatly tied to theme. And these days theme and experience leading from that becomes most important aspect for me. If game does not feel very thematic it greatly reduces my enjoyment.

This was my favorite game of BGG Con.  I was lucky enough to purchase it a few weeks later.  A fantastic worker placement with a lot of placement options, multiple paths to victory but still a tense and extremely strategic endgame.  The components are fantastic, the game play is easy to understand, set up is a bit longer than some other similar games but it's worth it.

Update: This is the best worker placement game ever made IMHO.

Relatively bog standard worker placement although I like the way the track progresses as you improve the colours available to you and the choices each track offers as you improve it. It may be bog standard with a theme that matters very little, but its enjoyable enough to be worth keeping. 

There is a good reason to work towards improving each track, and obviously not enough moves/opportunities in the game to max them all out for a bonus, that creates some nice decisions as the game unfolds. Unfolds is the right word as well, your priorities can change as the game progresses and different players grab different things and leave others alone.

Haven't played a game this good in a long time.  I really loved everything about it.  So many different paths to take, all seemingly valid and legitimate.  If you like worker placement games and you like games with multiple paths to victory, you'll love this game. (The game reminded me a little bit of Lords of Waterdeep, only better...and I really like LoW.)  

After my first play, I thought about the game long into the night and am anxious to play again.  I would have racked and stacked and played again, which is unheard of for me, esp with a two hour game.

Edit:  Dropped my rating some.  I think there is one path to victory that is so much better than others. It's hard to deviate from that path.

I'm having a hard time trying to determine how I personally feel about this one. For one thing, the rules are not very complex on the surface but the game is quite crunchy when it comes to the details. I can't say I'm used to a game with such simple worker placement mechanics making my head hurt so much. The engine building is fantastic considering on turn 1 you might get 10 points, but by turn 8 you can be scoring 100+ points for that round alone. It's a great game, but it's sitting on that threshold for me between fun and too puzzley.

Average worker placement game with different roads to disaster. Scripted first moves in almost each of the rounds as the engineer, the money and the extra meeples are mostly obvious. Lacking in balance between the different scoring options. Industry track is the most promising. Make sure to maximise at least two of the tracks. Too much tedious counting for my taste with victory points going up to around 400.

Must have from Essen 13. didn't get it because of big price difference english (40 euro) and german version (29 euro)

since it isn't language dependant I should have gone for the german version.

Bought it for a good price. 
and all I can say is wow. will play this again as soon as possible and probably  again soon after that.

This is the best easy to explain worker placement game I have ever played. Scores are snowballing. after two rounds scores were around 20 points for everybody. In the final round,6 rounds in 3 P game. I scored a massive 179 points to reach 300 points. The person that came in last was sure he had the victory but lost with over 50 points (he was a good  20 points ahead). 
Say no to close scoring and luck. Play Russian railroads.

second three player game
419 against 438 defeat. thirs player was 150 points back

An excellent game, positive players will love this game - it is in the rules that you cannot make a negative play :). My only reservation was the huge jumps you get in scoring at the games end which always left me wondering whether I won by skill (the correct answer) or just the big numbers involved. i.e. Most players score less than 10 points in the first turn (of a 6 turn game) and well over 100 in the last turn. Having played this game a good dozen times I am happy that skill in making the right choices is key to the game. Most scoring bonuses give you 20+ points and it is making sure that you have the right bonuses in place for your game that counts and will get you the win.

On the heavier side of worker placement with very euro, abstract mechanics where the theme is very subdued.  The various paths to victory are well balanced and the mechanics interact with each other in interesting and intricate ways.  Despite very low player interaction, the game is fairly intense and quite competitive.  There's a lot to like.  My only reservation is about repetitiveness and replayability, but as long as you don't overdo it, it's a great game.

Dry as dirt, devoid of theme snd soulless. Suffers from runaway leader. If you mess up your first rounds, there is no way for you to catch up and the only thing left to do is watch your opponents run laps aroud you on the scoreboard. Scoring is unnecessarily complicated and there is almost no interaction between players.

It's not a bad game. Russian Railroads offers eurogamers a lot of interesting choices and decisions. Multiple plays exploring different strategies will no doubt be rewarding. But this is not the game to play when you're trying to convince friends and family that today's boardgames are fun and exciting.

Ein Arbeiter Einsetz Spiel.
Durch Einsetzen seiner Arbeiter versucht man seine 3 Bahnstrecken und seine Industialisierung auszubauen, die nach jeder Runde entsprechend Punkte abwerfen. Nach 6 Runden ist der Spuk auch schon vorbei und eine kleine Schlusswertung findet statt.
Um seine Strecken richtig wertvoll zu machen muss diese erstmal mit schwarzen Gleisen gebaut, dann mit sibernen überbaut, gefolgt von braunen -> beigen -> weissen Gelisen, was enorm viele Aktionen benötigt. Alternativ kann man auf Streckenabschnitte gehen und sich Sonderpunkte freischalten oder eben auf die Industrie, die jede Runde auch Punkte akkumuliert. Eine großartige Mischung zwischen allem ist dabei nicht angeraten...
Spiel gefällt mir gut, aber ich brauch noch Übung... Man hat leider immer das Gefühl, dass man mehr machen möchte, aber nicht kann und das Spiel somit viel zu schnell vorbei ist, bevor man überhaupt was erreicht hat ;(.

What I was hearing about this made it sound like it wasn't going to be my type of game, and hoo-boy is it not. This one IS "just a mish-mash of point-generating elements" with nothing holding it together. It really feels like it was developed by a child, who just decided that this spot right here is the Lucky Frog spot and if you get a hamburger token there you get 20 points. Also this is a train track but THIS one is a Special Train Track and this one is Special Plus and this one is Special Plus Extreme. Glaze it with a varnish of Worker Placement (which isn't an element I dislike, but it's quickly becoming the Lazy Designer's Auction) and you're done. There are strategies an multiple paths and all kinds of stuff to try but, like Tzolk'in or Trajan, none of it is particularly interesting or engaging.

Very fun game. Well designed. Gives players lots to think about. Good mix of strategy and tactics.  My immediate reaction after two games back-to-back was to think how I can continue to hone my strategy.

The graphic design is superb and is a great example of how well-executed graphic design can enhance the gaming experience.  The scoring rules, which on first blush might seem a bit fiddly, are represented well by the graphic design on the player boards.  Very intuitive.  The artwork is also well done.  Russian Railroads is a nice looking game.

Overall, this is a well-polished game.  Super high-quality.  Will definitely hold a place in my collection for awhile.

I won my first game but I didn't really enjoy the game that much. It's just not for me because I don't like games that are too "math-y".  It's too much arithmetic for me.  Ok, I have 170 vp + 25 + 18 + 6 x 2 +.... ARGH!!  A lot of decisions come down to which will give me more points but in order to figure that out you have to do like 4-5 calculations in your head, total up all the numbers and then make the decision.  Blahhh. Not for me.

It also feels like each player is really just doing their own thing until someone takes your spot.  But people are usually taking spots not to harm the other person but because they need that spot.  So from a strategic standpoint it doesn't really matter what other players do.  We often found ourselves asking each other "Oh, did you go yet? Is it my turn?" because we didn't need to pay attention to each others turns.

More an evolution than revolution, yet it's a tight design loaded with tense moments. There are multiple scoring avenues to persue in a myriad of combinations, none of which seem to be best. 

The actual worker placement is the star and it's handled brilliantly. Engineer allow you to add to your personal options, they also serve as a revolving futures market that is shared for a time. 

One thing is for sure: Make sure you manage your turn order or you will regret it.

Update: Another play and it's a 9.

It's another worker placement engine-building Euro with no thematic ties to speak of! Do stuff to build a snowballing point engine so you can end the game with the most points (whether or not you've built much in the way of railroads).

There's a lot of interplay between various parts of the game; it's clearly a rich engine-builder even if it's dry as toast.

This game is an abstract train game, but it is a deeper game than it appears on the surface.  There are a number of combinations that enable you to accelerate the number of points you earn.  It has a myriad of different ways to win that you may not have considered.  There is a mini-expansion which is a must own expansion.  Otherwise the four player game becomes moderately difficult for an inexperienced player to be competitive.  

It is an excellent worker placement game that has a lot of depth.

RATING: 9
Start the game scoring 12 points per turn end it by scoring 180 per turn. Like a train gathering speed, you are constantly building up an engine that gives you more and more points. Awesome feeling at end of game.

RATING: 8
Interesting worker placement game at first blush.  Not sure how much staying power the game has, as it seems like there may be a dominant (or two) strategies for the most part.  Still, I like it enough to find out.

Update:  Played a few more times and it's hard to see a better strategy than the TransSiberian.  You have some extra actions to advance some on another track or two, but the primary strategy of TS always seems best so far.

Further update:  I can see how powerful the Kiev bonus points can be together with industry, depending on the flow of the game.  There are at least two or three viable strategies.  Enough to keep it interesting.

A fairly simple game to learn, [b][thing=144733][/thing][/b] appears to have multiple strategies to pursue.  Engineers, however, should not be overlooked and thus far have been dominating my two-player games.  Though I have not played it with more than two, I suspect this game is best at higher counts.  Too bad, because I quite enjoy it.

Played once. I don't get the hype. It's just another worker placement game, and although it has done away with the cumbersome resource conversion, it has instead a box full of bells and whistles that make no thematic sense whatsoever.
Ok, rant over, it's a decent game that forces the players to often make tough decisions and that allows a number of different strategies. It's also a bit too long, but that might improve with further playings.

Update after three plays: I'm getting the impression that it's not as scripted as I first suspected, so upping the rating by a point.
Update after a bunch of online games and another FtF play: It's still somewhat interesting to me, but it also feels too much like multi-player solitaire. Rating back to 7.

Interesting mash up of 18xx and a Euro.  Mostly Euro.  Fun, not too long, and HIGH SCORING.  I scored around 350 points both times I played.

RATING: 9
Fun game. It takes longer to teach than your average worker placement game. However, it is one of the few that actually plays in the stated time on the box.

Overall, I really like the game. There are lots of paths to pursue, and it is fun to earn the perks you get as you are working on them. I do, however, have two big complaints. One is that the 40 VP for most engineers is, IMO, way overpowered. The second is the VP earned for level 1 factories is also too much.

Très bon jeu de stratégie, par placement de meeples, sur le thème des chemins de fers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a bad game, but, you need a bookkeeper during the game. Too much counting. After every round, every persons board needs to be scored, and you need to pay good attention, because the counting is not straightforward.

Despite that counting, this is a exciting game, that for some strange reason, keeps you in suspense the whole time. 

It's a bad idea to let one person get away with one extreme strategy. So although you have the reflex to concentrate on your own board only, you should really have an idea what others are trying to do. 

Worker placement for building a point machine, is nothing new, but here it is applied to make up for an exciting game.

The theme stays very deep in the box and hardly pops up in your mind while playing the game

Minus: 2 - 5 - 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An impressively tight package, this is probably the deepest worker placement game you can finish within 90 minutes. Individual strategies are easy to describe but hard to implement, so although there is quite a steep learning curve, you can already have good fun while climbing it. And although it is not a breathtakingly original game, there are still some impressive design novelties in the details, first and foremost the upgrading of the tracks and how it notches up your capabilities.

In spite of all this praise, for my own taste this veers to much towards being a pure abstract, and there is not quite as much interaction as I tend to like in my games. As far as I can tell from this somewhat reserved stance, this seems to be a great game if you are looking for something you can really sink your teeth into – with a dedicated group, this should be a very rewarding game with lots of counter-strategies and feinting going on.

Standard worker-placement game. Not great, not bad either. Unfortunately the theme does not exist and the "Russian" railroad could very easily be, e.g.,  "australian". In fact the implementation of theme is a little strange with all these different rails. There is no interaction between players (as you might expect) besides the competition for an action, although some actions are obligatory at the start of each round, but there is no real tension for them, as everyone knows that they should choose these actions irrespectively of their strategy, so they prepare accordingly.

On the possitive side, the game has easy rules, the gameplay is fast (although prone to AP and a relatively tedious setup) - takes about half an hour for each player - and seems fairly balanced (the not-so-many-as-it-seems-at-first paths to victory are equally strong). 

I don't see why should I pick this over another well-established worker-placement euro, but I would play it occasionally with the right group.

One of my favorite games from BGG.Con 2013.  It was the first game I played the morning of the con and I was not disappointed.  It wasn't even on my list of games to try before the con started, but I'm glad fate dragged me in that direction.

It's a worker placement plain and simple.  Unlike Agricola where you get penalized for missing items like sheep and veggies, in Russian Railroads a nice balance isn't required.  Pick your path and go nuts.  At the end of the game it's victory point palooza.

The scoring during the game is a bit wacky, but once you understand it, it makes total sense.  Took us a couple of rounds to really understand how you scored each track.

Cute worker placement but strategically repetitive. Seems to be just 2 major strategies of vladiwostok or kiev/industry and the cutthroatness of worker placement can be lost if players don't have overlapping strategies.

RATING: 7
Decent worker placement game. The computational burden (every turn you have to calculate a huge amount of scoring points from the different tracks) was a bit too much though. The theme also didn't shine through too much, and at the end you had the feeling to have completed almost nothing, while an enormous amount of points comes your way through a huge range of combos.

I really like this game. There are so many paths to victory and so many strategies to try. It's got just enough depth, and play time to not feel like you've wasted a whole night in a losing battle.  You can sometimes see who is probably going to win by the mid-game but depending on strategy others *may* pull it out at the end.

All in all, a great game with a great rule book.

I love train games but they're often very heavy (with exception of TTR, which while my favorite game of all time, isn't that thematic). Not sure if this one is that thematic either but it's a lot lighter than things like Steam.. But it still has a sense of building. Not sure if it's worth all the hype, there are so many worker placement games already... I also think it sorely needs an expansion for more variability, hopefully DSP victory encourages them to make one.

RATING: 6
Pure worker placement game with tough decisions.  I'm not a fan of the end game and question mark bonus cards, though perhaps they are necessary to keep the game from becoming stale given that the only random element is the engineer grouping/order. It seems that the best strategy is to go heavy on one line (or industry) while getting the two question mark bonuses from the middle track. Much like Caylus (which I also rated a 7.5), I admire the design of the game more than I wish to play it again.

Interesting game. I like the various engines that you can build. At the moment I am still trying out new routes and tricks, so I am not done with the game yet. However, in the long run I suspect that plays will become samey. After all it is just another worker placer like so many. At least I don't have to feed them and there is no fuss about resource collection and conversion. Like in other worker placers interaction is limited to grabbing a spot just before someone else does, otherwise you are optimizing on your own.

At first it seems you have a lot of choices. In the beginning, you don't get many points for anything - to amass lot of points, you really need to focus on one strategy. It seems that one is rushing industry and kiev (bottom), the other one is focusing on transsiberian(top). Progress both with st. petersburg(middle), when handy. A bit disappointing when all games go through like this. However, if I didn't play this lots and lots of times on Yucata or BGA, I would have never found out.
Love the art and the mechanics, as well as the engineers to buy with coins. Often, beginning of turns feel very samey though.

Nếu bạn là một gamer thích những game có hỗ trợ các nước đi thần thánh, những nước đi có khả năng lật kèo toàn bộ game hoặc khiến mọi người phải trầm trồ thì Russian Railroad không phải là game dành cho bạn. RR là một cuộc đua mà chỉ cần bạn hụt một vòng so với đối phương thì coi như kết quả toàn game đã được định đoạt, bạn không có quyền mắc sai lầm trong RR nếu muốn chiến thắng.

Game lấy bối cảnh xây dựng đường sắt ở Nga, nơi bạn là người đang cố gắng xây dựng 3 tuyến đường sắt huyết mạch một cách nhanh nhất và tốt nhất so với đối thủ. Game có 4 đường để ghi điểm khác nhau, và cho dù mỗi đường có những điểm lợi và hại khác nhau thì chỉ cần bạn kiên trì tới cuối 1 đường, số điểm thưởng sẽ là cực kỳ lớn. Điểm của bạn sẽ được tính vào cuối mỗi vòng và nó sẽ liên tục được tăng theo cấp số nhân qua mỗi vòng. Game có 6-7 vòng tùy theo số người chơi và số điểm cuối game của một người chơi thường ở mức 300-400 điểm.

Bạn dùng những công nhân của mình để xây đường sắt, xây các đoàn tàu, xây nhà máy. Bạn dùng tiền để thuê thêm công nhân, các chuyên viên để hỗ trợ cho việc xây dựng và cải tiến các công trình của mình. Đường sắt có 4 cấp độ và đoàn tàu có 9 cấp độ tương ứng với 9 loại nhà máy khác nhau vì khi các đoàn tàu không còn được sử dụng, nó sẽ được rã xác để xây nhà máy. Mỗi loại đường sắt được ghi điểm dựa trên cấp độ của đoàn tàu của bạn, nhà máy ngoài việc cung cấp điểm thưởng mỗi vòng còn cho bạn thêm những hiệu ứng phụ lợi hại và rất hữu ích cho toàn bộ công trình của bạn. Khi bạn phát triển mạng lưới đường sắt của mình đến từng mốc thưởng trên từng đoạn đường bạn cũng sẽ nhận được những hiệu ứng có sức ảnh hưởng lớn. Vậy nên việc phát triển ra sao, đường nào trước, đường nào sau là tùy thuộc vào khả năng của bạn. Việc xây dựng của bạn và người chơi khác không có ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau, nhưng nó lại ảnh hưởng đến những hành động mà bạn có thể làm trong một lượt, vì nếu cả hai đều đi cùng một hướng phát triển thì việc bóp nhau liên tục thường xuyên xảy ra. Bạn cần có những kế hoạch dài hạn và thay đổi kế hoạch ngắn hạn thường xuyên nếu không muốn bị hụt trong cuộc đua đường dài.

Nhiệm vụ ẩn trong game là hạn chế và thường dễ đạt được, cũng như tổng số điểm không chênh lệch nhau bao nhiêu. Cả game mỗi người chơi chỉ có thể có một nhiệm vụ ẩn hoặc không, và nhiệm vụ đó cũng chỉ có thể cho bạn từ 30-40 điểm. Trong khi số điểm một vòng bạn có thể ghi được lại từ 100-200 điểm và hầu như ai cũng có thể hoàn thành được, nên gần như nó không có ảnh hưởng lớn đến kết quả chung cuộc. Đây có lẽ là một điểm trừ, nhưng nếu nhìn theo cách thiết kế tổng thể của game, dường như tác giả muốn người chơi phải thực sự tham gia một cuộc đua quyết liệt và không được mắc sai lầm thì điều này cũng hợp lý.

Nhìn chung RR là một game worker placement tốt, hành động và đồ họa đều gắn kết với theme và yêu cầu khả năng tính toán cũng như tập trung cao của nguòi chơi. Có vẻ game chưa được cân bằng tốt lắm vì có một số đường khá mạnh hơn các đường còn lại, game cần kết hợp với bản mở rộng Germany Railroad để có thể trở nên hoàn hảo. Nếu bạn ưa thích worker placement và race game cũng như những game có thematic tốt thì đây là một game dành cho bạn. Đánh giá base game : 9đ

A really cool, but rather abstract worker placement game. You are building up train tracks and factories in Russia, only you're not doing it on any kind of map. Instead you have three train tracks on your player board and one factory track.

During the game you try to build up the best engine possible to score points. The first couple of rounds may earn you only a handful of points (you score your board at the end of every round), but it won't be long until your engine truly kicks off. The clue is to pick your strategy and stick to it. If you stray from it, you will lose momentum which can make a huge difference towards the end of the game.

It's very enjoyable, but definitely more for people who enjoy math-y and think-y games.

So far a test game, but I liked it enough to buy a copy.  Too many ways to score makes it hard to tell if you are doing well.  Total theme gameplay mismatch, and no direct interaction drop it down a bit, but still quite interesting and a lot to explore.  Don't like the box edge art, though, and that is what I have to stare at on my shelf.

Plays pretty well as two player but you have to choose a scoring path and stay on it.

Very nice worker placement. I love the spaces that require 2 or 3 workers or those that require coins (joker workers). Even the first player debates his move over a blank board because he must balance economy with power. The engineers offer an ever-rotating pair of action spaces that ensures the rounds don't remain stagnant, but it's the locomotives and factories that push the progression of the game rather than Agricola-style round progression. There appear to be so many paths to victory, or at least a different mix of balances between those strategies: four different tracks, deep or shallow, bonus points or track upgrades, engineers or industry. I really like this one.

I think I've played this enough times to know where it stands in my collection. This can be a pretty fun game if you're playing with 3 or 4 and at least a couple of the players are "getting it." With only 2 or with inexperienced players, there just isn't nearly enough interaction or confrontation for my tastes. As far as these point engine euros go, it's pretty good and if I'm going to own one it might as well have pictures of trains on it.

But the feeling I got out off it was very disappointing.
Nothing really new, optimization VP engine, spreadsheet game style, with no theme whatsoever. Multiple scores that give tons of points, colors and tracks and numbers. mehhhh.

Provisional rating. I don't like worker placement games that have some really forced moves--in this case, there is exactly one spot for money and one spot for hiring an engineer (for which money is mandatory), so there are some opening moves that are just incredibly strong. So then you end up fighting for turn order and basically it feels like the game is directly _forcing_ you to be a jerk to other players rather than making aggressive play an _option_ or a _strategy_. -- That said, it's got a lot going for it in other ways, so I'll persist playing it for a bit to see if the initial sour taste wears off. I've only been able to play it online as it's been inexplicably out of print for a while.

Next play: ended up basically 2 turns from the end with nothing to do (all the trains were taken, so that was that). Still feels like a particularly mean-spirited game, and while it sucks to be on the receiving end of the meanness, I'm not sure I want to get good enough to be doling out the meanness instead. As with Caylus, it feels to me that unless players are extremely well-balanced in terms of ability, the balance will tip very early and it's basically not much fun to continue playing.

RATING: 7.2
This is a worker placement game where there are always more things that you want to do than you can do. As you move along the tracks on your player board you gain action abilities which mean that the scoring in the early rounds of around 10 - 20 VPs are completely dwarfed in the later rounds where you are scoring in the 100s. I wanted to play this as it has got a lot of marmite press around it either being the greatest thing since the creation of a meeple or broken with a single path to victory. In our game it was clear that not specialising in one (or maybe two) tracks means that you never get the high powered benefits and the player who did the point salad approach lost by nearly 200 VPs. I have a slight concern as to how the more powerful engines ever come out, but otherwise the game is good.

After a second play, I really like this game. But I still have concerns over how the more powerful engines come into play as we only got as far as the 5 engines!

Excellent worker placement with some sweet combo-building. The theme is pasted on and it's not a train game by any means, but that doesn't bother me at all, since I like the feel and visuals of the game. Plus the cascading of the points is quite satisfying. In the end it's "just another euro", but a good one at that.

Heavy worker placement. With the German Railroads expansion you get some much needed variance in the game. There's three or four strategies in this so after a few plays it can feel repetitive. It's long so it won't get played that much so it's not as pressing an issue as in other games.

A very fun game with really limited replay value. If this wasn't such a spreadsheet experience, this could easily get an 8 or a 9 from me. This is a game that doesn't hide the fact that you pick one of 3 or 4 paths to take, and try to avoid taking the same one as everyone else. This is one of those games that can be "solved," but I still look back on it fondly. Feels counter-intuitive to focus on one railroad though. I think it should be more rewarding to dabble a little into everything.

Excellent game. Full of things to do. A million paths to go. It may turn to be a little solitaire at the end, and getting an engineer it may be a no brainer move to the first player. But I really liked the experience. More plays will say if the rating will increase or lower a little bit.

Update- after only 2 plays the game starts to fell a little samey. The first 3 moves on each round seems a bit scripted. Take engineer, money and workers.

Update: two more Plays, in one one of the player bet heavy in the indústria. Won by a huge margin.
In the second game I only play in the top line. Get all the blacks I could. Ignored, everything else, got 399 points.

You must specialize to win. 
It should be a bit longer. I always want to play one more round.

Based on building the Trans-Sibera rail lines, this worker placement game allows players to expand up to five different rails on a single line. The trick is that the rails have to be developed sequentially, and the later rails are worth more points. Players are also rewarded with extra workers, bonus cards or advantages as they further advance their lines. There are also engineers in the game, which a player can claim and use as their own for the rest of the game. 

This is a very good game, with many paths to victory, and different things to try. This is a very tense game as you try to develop your VP generating income. You don't know if your opponent's strategy will be better than yours!

Strategy wise, the first person to get the 9 locomotive is going to have a good game. If you were racing to get the 9 locomotive and fail in the attempt, then your game will suffer. On the other hand, the Trans Siberian strategy can be effective as well, but you have to be focused, and a few things have to work out, such as your opponents not taking X2 tokens. I've played many games, and I'm still looking forward to more plays. I certainly haven't mastered all the strategies, and sometimes end up on the wrong end of the scoreboard, but still try to get better at this game. 

My only past criticism of this game is that the person with the 9 locomotive will have a strong game. I believe this can be countered by a Trans Siberian strategy, and happy to play both strategies. Currently, my only criticism would be if multiple players are trying to do the same thing, then that may leave another person to potentially run away with the game. 

This game scales well from 2-4 players as well. This would be my vote for game of the year for 2014.

Reinforces how much I dislike WP as a mechanic. It lends itself to higher downtime because if the player takes the action you planned and/or changed the relative value of a variable in a game right before your turn, you need to renalyze the board state to make your decision. When all 4 players do this, it leads to higher downtime. In contrast, games with a card selection dont have this as the value of the card in your hand is usually constant and cant be taken by others. Similar for role selection and simultaneous games where you can still do an action usually and its a faster binary choice of you whether to do it or not, if you can.

This game's negatives: scoring the tracks points is a bit confusing the first time, ignoring the bottom part is very difficult/impossible, and a lot of little bits and pieces. This makes it fiddly but deep, not always the best combination. Positives: the game's action spots were generally well done and is polished and clean for the most part without need to check the rules and such. The math was alright and building up semi interesting. One issue is if a player got ahead, you cant soeasily catch up at all aince the point difference will just grow.

A pure worker placement game. After reading the rules I thought that the game was too scripted and that there were too few choices. Instead the game is very exciting to play, in a surprising way, so much more than what I supposed reading the rules.

The reason I don't rate it even higher is that choices, although more "personalized" and creative than what I imagined reading the rules, are somehow a bit too "easy", there is no possibilities of an extremely creative move, but a sum of optimization moves that may result in collecting a lot of points. Also I am not sure about replayability.

In any case a nice game, relaxing to play.

UPDATE
After 6 plays my wish to play again has become very low, the game is somehow too scripted for my tastes and replayabiility is low. Sold and lowered the rating.

This game let's you do so much with very little. Once you know the different strategies it becomes a very cutthroat race to the limited spaces. Normally not a Fan of game with too many points, this game makes it just right with ramoing up the points. It's very satisfying to make 7 or 8 points in the first round and as much as 200 in the last one.

Russian Railroads is a polarizing title. For those who were expecting to enjoy a new Train game, prepare to be disappointed. The opposite is true for those who were dreading another Train game. RR is a Worker Placement game, and a rather abstract one at that.

RR is complicated, with lots of things to do, giving a variety of paths to victory. One must be flexible when blocked by an opponent and yet stay focused on only a couple of these paths. Lunging for the lowest hanging fruit and only trying to achieve the next nearest VP payout each turn is a surefire way to lose.

Unfortunately, much of what you do in RR makes little thematic sense. The main mechanics of extending your rail lines, improving the trains that run on them, hiring staff, and improving the industry supporting it all I get, but how does one explain the overlaying of grey, brown, creme, and white track? It may sound here like a small aspect of the game, but it is a primary way to gain points.

Victory points skyrocket in RR, possibly reaching over 500! In games with new players versus a veteran I could see this leading to absolutely crushing defeats where the experienced player laps the noobs a couple times.

This is a great worker placement/train game.  I love the different paths to victory that I still have not discovered quite yet.  

I successfully completed the top route for a win with big points, but the other tracks still elude me to play correctly when opponents are in my way!  

Great game, and would even consider the expansion if I get tired of the different routes to victory in the original.

RATING: 6.5
A big honkin worker placement, NOT a train game. Think Belfort remade by a Feld doppelganger who has the "multiple ways to score victory points" technique down but not the heart or elegance (and loves to have players doing arithmetic). Good experience, might play again, but it felt overdone. I'm also not terribly keen on the unfettered victory point grab-- in that sense, this game reminded me of Royal Palace. Another dampening factor is that I wouldn't play much differently on a second go-round -- I think I chose the right path to score the requisite obscene number of points in rounds 5 and 6. Lack of strategic variation game to game is fine for shorter games, but this clocks in at around 2 hours, and that makes me wonder what I'd get out of a second play. 

(Also of note is that this is one of the more or less silent-strategy games, as opposed to the party-strategy games [Witch's Brew and VivaJava] and the muttering-strategy games [Through the Ages and Twilight Imperium]) 

Things for a newbie to know: always unlock the bonus card ? thingy.

midweight development game. on your development board there are four tracks to develop. on three of four there could be more than two advancing development markers. acquiring higher numbered locomotives allow to score developments to higher numbers on those three tracks. On the fourth track industry tiles allow to climb further. additional workers, bonus scoring tiles can also come from more development. this is a worker placement game and most of the actions are moving development markers. there are locomotive and industry tile actions as well as a money action. money can be used as workers and also engineer tiles can be bought that provide an exclusive action space of your own. there are 6/7 rounds and there is scoring after each round.
the game is relatively fast. since scoring is cumulative it may be difficult to win if you are behind early. I can imagine this game could turn out to be samey after several plays.

It's a nice worker placement game, with a completely abstract core, that offers you 5 tracks you can advance on, each one with shorter and longer term goals and bonuses.

I enjoyed more the 2 players ones because you can see more what you're doing, you can plan your strategy better (probably because they are shorter too). With more players, you make your move and just pray that not all the other players will pick the spots you want. With 2 players, you can easily see what he's doing and what his interests are; and, in the worst case, you know he will steal only one of your spots. That gives you much more space for planification.

What the games excels on is the decisions. You have to take plenty of decisions, with some risks. 

Still, I'm not in love with this game, as seems to be the case of many many people.

I don't see a lot of variability to grant long term replayability.

A solid worker placement with that precious HiG touch: Even though the game looks heavy at first sight, the structure is very clean and intuitive, and the only hindrance is calculating the scores. The low number of rounds also makes sure there's never enough time to do everything you want.

Quite impressed after first play but it is interesting to see how this holds up after multiple sessions.

RATING: 6
Tipico piazzamento lavoratori che offre diverse strategie da seguire; il gioco non è un ferroviario. Ci sono tre tratte ferroviarie principali che offrono differenti vantaggi, ogni giocatore dovrà interaprendere la propria via, il più delle volte 'specializzandosi'. L'interazione è presente al momento della scelta delle azioni, che vengono quindi precluese agli avversari, ma è difficile riuscire a contrastare efficacemente un avversario in altre maniere. Da approfondire.

RATING: 4
Another worker-placement and resource optimiser, but despite the general lack of originality, there are potentially a few clever avenues to explore. The 'score as far as your train goes' mechanic is nice, but elsewhere there's too much Caylus-like procedurality and ill-advised if-then-or planning required. The points-gathering and adding-up phase is excruciating. 

The whole thing could easily be shorn of the game-end bonuses and industry track in favour of making something a little tighter, I'd have thought.

[b]Russian Railroads[/b]

[i]Update - Really want to play this again with the new German map especially since my one play still sticks out in my mind and my kids are much older. However; I ended up ordering First Class: Unterwegs im Orient Express instead. If that's a hit maybe I'll still consider picking this one up.[/i]

[i]RR is going on my wishlist, but it is definitely too heavy to be a family game at my house right now. I also do not think it would be quite as good playing 2p with my son. So for now I will play it whenever I get a chance at a con, etc. My rating could go up with a few more plays, but for now it is an average game.[/i]

首次玩300分 感覺是分差會很大的遊戲
兩人遊戲目前尚未突破400分
雪球般的滾分是很特別的一點
成就感不錯的遊戲
規則挺清楚的，比較沒有容易混淆的地方
規則:
*起始五張獎勵卡打開，額外加分卡暗抽掉兩張，火車頭分類放好(2-9)，工程師照AB分類洗勻，三個A放右邊，四個B放左邊
*每個人七個工人(一個放回盒子)，起始五個工人一塊錢可用，個人圖板最上面放一個1的火車頭(其他沒用到的1收回盒中)，黑鐵軌放第一格，工業軌放對應位置，每個人再拿額外工業軌，獎勵圓片
*隨機發順位卡給每個人，在照反順位拿起始獎勵卡，獎勵資源拿了卡片就移走，起始玩家無獎勵
*每回合輪流放工人，放完工人就執行行動，沒事做就pass根據順位卡計分，七輪後結束，每輪結束計分，錢可取代工人
1.推鐵軌 可分開推不同鐵路的同顏色軌，後面顏色不能超過前面的
2.火車頭 拿數字最小的火車頭放或當成工廠(工廠可拿供應區的)，火車頭放的時候取代其他的，被取代的可放到其他格，如果都滿就放回供應區成為工廠，工廠五個蓋滿後可以任意取代
3. 僱工程師 僱完的成為該玩家的額外行動區
4. 順位格 不能踩在自己順位下面，一個人只能採一格，沒踩的往右推，該工人可以在移動到其他格(第二格先動)，如果首位玩家採第二格且第一個沒人踩，順位不換
*個人圖板如果有符合該標記可獲得獎勵(有火車頭的話要火車頭能涵蓋到)
*每輪計分 每條鐵軌案火車頭涵蓋到的範圍計鐵路顏色分數，還有工廠計分
*之後工程師右移，沒被僱的就移出遊戲，最後一輪順位格會被額外行動取代
*遊戲最後工程師額外加分(數量平手就比數字最大)跟額外加分卡加分
*兩人用另一面圖版，每個火車頭用兩個，工程師3A3B，工人全用，起始六個，起始兩塊錢，可踩在自己的順位格上
*三人火車頭用三個，工程師3A3B，最左邊空著，工人全用起始六個

Very good worker placement game that flows well and easily. It's an interesting scoretrack progression mechanism, having to spend actions to push the lower scoring markers along to make room for each successively higher scoring marker. I also liked how there were choices to make between actions that cost 1 worker or the same action with 50% more power that cost 2 workers. It combines freedom and room to move. Plus the variable actions that the game introduces each round, but which can also be "won" for your personal use. In fact, there's lots of things to like. Not so great is that the theme is non-existent ... it really is a pure Euro worker placement game designed to force you to specialise so as to maximise your points and hope that other people leave you the actions you want to maximise that strategy (ie do what others aren't!). Still, if this is your thing, it's very elegant with obvious replay.

Have played a few times. One of the longest lasting games from Essen '13. For me it's a bit to "short" just when you get going and start having fun it ends. I prefer games where you try to reach the end as fast as possible rather than getting as much as possible done in a limited number of actions. Especially in games like this where you want to do so much more than there are enough actions for. But this is one of the better games with that feeling.

A solid euro. But rather heavy for Hans im Glück. Still very well designed and fun experience. The game hits all the right buttons for Euro-lovers. The theme is pasted on and could also be about duck hunting.

This is a standard worker placement with a train theme. You place workers that allow you to move track forward which in turn triggers bonuses and points. Nothing really original but it is done very well. There are tons of options and combos here you can really get caught up in it or it may be overwhelming for some. But for those who like heavy worker placement (like me) where every action your opponent takes frustrates you, this is a must.

Definitely an elegant worker placement in which there is depth with a low barrier to learning which is fantastic. 8 is a tentative rating for now. May go higher or lower. Time will tell. 14/5/16

Down to a 7 now. You begin to see some of the holes in the game and the stronger strategies. This is via 3 2 player games though. Will need to try with more players to see how that changes things (which I expect it will). 21/5/16

On further reflection I think this one should be 7.5. It is a better game than a 7 even though the replayability may wane. 26/5/16

Russian Railroads is a worker placement engine-building game.  You're placing your workers to advance of various tracks (literally) on your player board, and you'll score after each round according to how well you've built out the tracks.  Where the game really shines is in the variety of rewards you get for your tracks--building out to certain spots gives you an additional reward, like an extra worker, access to a more valuable track type, or a reward of your choice that can include stuff like end-game bonus cards or better multipliers for the rest of the game.  This stops people from hammering specific tracks, as you have to do a variety to gain these rewards.  There's really a ton of options here, and it just feels really rewarding to try and make everything fit together.

Initially I was absolutely in love with Russian Railraods. I played it again and felt like 2 player flopped a bit. After playing it with a full count of players, I feel like thats how this game really shines. Tension, fighting over spaces, the full side of the board is great and if people aren't actively buying trains, you kind of flounder with shitty trains for a while.

The components are great and I feel like there is some space to explore, but as of right now, not sure how deep exactly you can go. I'd have to say I'm also more impressed with it 2 player than I initially was. It's still tense and having only a few spaces for some critical actions makes it very tense.

Includes the Mini expansion.

One of the best worker placement games of all time, in my opinion, featuring many roads to victory, all heavily contested. The base game can be good post-gateway game to complex worker placement games, after [thing=34635][/thing]. The indirect interaction between players can be heated and tense as valuable actions are blocked. The quality of the components is outstanding, nevertheless, the base game cannot take a perfect 10 as it can get scripted after repeated plays. I take into account all released expansions to-date in my rating.

Let's not bang the gaming revolution drums, people. This game does seem solid, however. All of the scoring paths are varied and seem equally viable. In fact, there are so many paths and strategies to scoring that I feel I have to play a bunch more times to even try them all out, let alone refine them. 

Hilarious scoring, with turns near the end of the game piling on the points so fast you'll be whipping around the board like go-karts powered with nitrous oxide. 

This is based on only 2p version so far. 

EDIT: Seems pretty good at first, but there is really no strategic variation game-to-game. The lack of variety is disguised initially by the fact that there are at least four very different paths to victory, and they all seem to have a fighting chance, but that's the thing: they all seem very different but are functionally identical. And once you have explored each of the four strategies, which one you will pursue any given game is almost arbitrary. Not a bad game, but one that does not have replay value beyond 3-4 shots.

Pure worker placement game about getting train tracks built and having trains to go along them. Yes, the game is very dry. It does however have a very streamlined feel, it's open but the different parts do play into each other very nicely. This game is all about getting your engine rolling, and trying to get bonuses, industries etc. to help the snowballing scores, as you score close to everything (there are a couple of end game bonuses) after every round. Calculating what would provide most points can be a turn off to some, and it feels like the game sometimes punishes you for not committing to tracks or industries. Overall enjoyable!

Plus the rule book is fantastic and the play time is perfect at around 60-90 min including set-up (we play mostly 2 player games).

My single play of this was quite enjoyable. Russian Railroads is straightforward to teach, learn, and play. There seem to be several viable paths to victory, as players in our game took divergent strategies. There are several ways to score points, and many of those ways allow players to accumulate points at the end of every round. Such a system may lead to a run-away leader, but I would need more plays to be sure. I can’t say anything too damning about RR, except the fact that there just isn’t much new that the game offers. It is a very solid worker placement game, but I’m not sure I need to play, let alone own, yet another WP game.

This is a really shameless snowball game.  It has a point salad aspect to it (but not Feld levels of point salad).  The rulebook is very well done and it was easy to learn the game. My partner tends to dislike engine-building / snowball games, particularly those with a strong dose of worker placement.  These, however, tend to be my favorites.  I'm not sure how much table time this will see, due to this conflict in gaming tastes.

I got to play this on my birthday at GameHaus! 

This game is a decent worker placement game which has some neat mechanisms in the game. The lower quality tracks have to go ahead of the higher quality tracks add in a extra layer of thoughtfulness. In the 2-player setting game we had no problem getting trains so it's probably a smoother sail than a 4-player game. We enjoyed it quite a lot since there is less blocking and more optimizing. 

My fiancee liked it less than I because she felt the theme was awesome but the mechanisms didn't convey that to her. She rated her play at 7.5/10.

Very nice worker-placement game! People who like to brood plans will find a perfect opportunity to do so. Extremly well done rules, lots of nerve wrecking decisions. Players without plan will lose. Period.

During the game there are still possibilities to modify your initial plans. There are short time and long time planning targets. 

Good variability (random usage of engineers and victory cards during set-up), set-up gives perfect knowledge about the situation and players can immediately start agonizing about the perfect plan. 

This is the best game since Puerto Rico came out - for me, it could be that this one even beats Puerto Rico!

Physically this is very well done and symbology and icongraphy is perfect.

Well done, Hans im Glück!

[Update] This game is good with 4,3 and 2 players! Best is probably 4. This game is so elegant because it allows more development and fun within its 2 hour playing time than other games deliver with double playing time or overly complicated rules.

Another big plus: Clear design for play.
No cards with 4/5th baroque graphics and 1/5th dedicated to 20+ lines of lawyer-style itsy-bitsy 2-point red text on pink background. Good choice of colours (boards and pieces), once you know the game you need the rulebook just to check the VC cards for the first few games.

Another boring typical theme-less cube pusher euro game...

This game brings absolutely nothing new or revolutionary to the table... as it's been done a few hundred times.

Also, with 4 players, it took 3 and half hours to finish the game... painful...

I also questions this game re-playability as after 2 or 3 games, this game becomes a boredom. Yes there are a lot of actions to make, but there is only 2 or 3 real strategies in the game. The industry route is kind of broken and the other feels too similar.

This game has a false feeling of depth and variability but in the end, every game feels the same.

Very poor and overrated piece of trash.

Excelente juego de colocación de trabajadores, tienes infinidad de formas de puntuar, excelentes componentes. Se los recomiendo bastante!

Actualización:

Es un juego entretenido, el problema es que obligatoriamente tienes que desarrollar la industria porque quedas en mucha desventaja y eso para mi le resta en dediciones interesantes.

Act#2:

Sigo viendo el ultra error de forzosamente construir la industria, para mi eso rompió el juego, por eso no sube de 8.5 a mi modo de ver. Ah y no tiene absolutamente nada de relación con trenes comparado con railway of the world

Act#3

Descubrí que si pose varias estrategias, no es necesario seguir la vía de la industria, pero ya les contaré en futuros acercamientos con este juego.

Although somewhat engaging, I was unimpressed considering the hype. A worker placement and optimization game in which players try to maximize their victory point generating engine. It seems unforgiving to the new players, with a run-away leader problem. If the first player gets a good Engineer, it would be a big advantage and could give a good start to the player's VP engine with potential snowballing effect.

There are lots of much better worker placement games I would rather play ahead of this (e.g. Puerto Rico, Caylus, Stone Age), but I'll give this one a couple of more tries.

In this game, players use worker placement to build and improve the rail lines on their player boards. Once everyone passes out of an action round, each player's board produces victory point income based on how far you've reached with your different lines. Once your lines reach certain points on your board, abilities unlock improving your income or giving you a big one time bonus.

The base game alone is very fun, but it does have a few 'best paths' through the game. This is completely solved with the German Railroads expansion, which replaces the player boards from the base game with some that have spots to customize your boards when they are reached with rails.

The worker placement process itself is fascinatingly built where actions require different numbers of workers depending on the strength, and the fantastic tension created by the concept that money can always be used in place of workers, but money is tight, and some of the most important action spaces can ONLY be taken with money.

I have to say I'm baffled by the compliments this is getting for its 'many paths to victory' and 'overwhelming options'. To me it seems to be a game of choosing one of (at best) a handful of baked-in paths at the outset and spending the rest of the game executing it as efficiently as you possibly can. Indeed, the most thematic element I can detect here is the extent to which the game railroads its players.

Player interaction consists of being aware of the furrows the other players are ploughing so that you can identify the 'hot zones' on the shared worker placement board that you need to prioritise. But even then the game strongly rewards you for hiving off your most vital actions to your player board, via the engineers. The whole thing resembles nothing so much as a complex piece of machinery (complete with prescriptive operating manual), the sole purpose of which is to spit out exponentially-increasing gobbets of victory points. This is what "Euro" means to many people in the 2010s and it makes me sad.

Hard to give it a fair evaluation after one play. Impossible to play well on first try even knowing all the rules. All tracks are not equal so if you choose the wrong one's you're screwed.

I'd consider giving this one more try if I had to.

My only thought is: Gaming time is very limited. There are thousands of games but only dozens of hours to play them. Why bother? 

It's a game that has a complicated tech tree. You need to know where you're headed and have an idea what you'll be doing in the last round if you even want to have a chance. Not knowing the path I was spending actions for 5-6 points each while Josh and Kin was getting 25-30 points for each of theirs. The chasm between players is so large why do they all bother playing? I would never expect to see 4 players within 20 points of each other in this game at the end.

The Rich get richer and the losers are just cannon fodder blocking actions knowing there is no chance in hell of scoring half the points of the winner with 3 rounds left to go.

RATING: 8
A straight forward worker placement game. The interaction primarily is the competition for board action spaces. Otherwise and individual optimization effort to pursue as you try to get your victory point engine going. 

The game looks great, and is smooth playing, but I fear that it will lose replay value. While there are multiple paths to pursue for victory points, they look to be static. It looks to be an optimization game to have your general strategies, with enough flexibility to see where others are going so you can work around them. 

I really liked how the engineers were dynamic - I wish there were other parts of the game was like it. So that the players would have slight different goals or strengths.

It looks like a game you would like to play a few times and put on hold for a while to rediscover later.

I could not wait to play this after hearing a lot of good things about it, but for me it did not live up to the hype.  I did not feel at all like I was building or running railroads.  It is a pure worker placement game, which I morally really like.  I just felt like I was crunching numbers with no theme.  The industry part of the game just felt like a game mechanic and not at all like building industry along a railroad.  It was not a bad game, but there are a lot of other games  I would rather play.

Double-O-nonXX is roughly as promising as it can get. I am not a big fan of worker-placement games, but this one seems to work quite well. The (almost) exponentially growing points per round are a bit scary, making the game hard to approach and causing some AP for the last 1-2 rounds, especially for people not so good in mental arithmetic.

RATING: 6
When I first saw the game I lost interest because there is no map of Russia in this game. In essence this is a worker placement where you try to develop three railway lines or your industries. You move your building blocks up to the destination.
There are so many ways to collect points that it nearly feals meaningless what you do. Interaction is minimal because there are enough choices who look similar.

RATING: 8.5
My most anticipated game of the Year

Edit:  After one play, this feels NOTHING like an 18XX worker placement game. Which is the idea that this game was sold to me on before it's release.  It's a OK worker placement game (which I like) but nothing breath taking or ground breaking here.  I will play it because, well, I enjoy these kind of games, but the same itch can probably be better scratched for me by either Agricola, Caverna, Le Havre, Ore et Labora, or Euphoria.

RATING: 7
This needs an expansion somewhat desperately. After, at most, your second play through you're going to realize that the decision space is such that the game is really about somewhat odious blocking and fussing about for turn order as the big scoring opportunities are limited.

Lucky for us, it got it. But the question remains: why not just start with German Railroads and never print the overly limited Russian boards in the first place?

An excellent, thoughtful euro.     Scratches that worker placement engine building itch, and offers a multitude of different viable strategies.    
The overall gameplay doesn't vary much from one play to the next, but if you like it for what is you'll find that it offers a surprising amount of depth.

This is a good Eurogame. It is more abstract and deterministic than I prefer, but the mix of scoring objectives is enticing. There is a nice sense of just being one action short of what you hope to accomplish each turn. The difficulty of novice players to challenge experienced players can be a turn-off for less committed gamers. The math is deep, but once mastered a player can win much like a chess master against lesser opponents.

Straightforward worker placement but with so many variations of strategy.
Three train lines to build offer three different ways to get points, plus the industry track. Do you focus on one or spread more thinly for a litle of each.

A great thinky, mathy, worker placement. I was worried about the replay value until I started mixing up my strategies. It seems there are many paths to victory, despite some paths seeming overpowered at first. Crazy how many points you can score in this game, and it can feel very swingy at times. The score track just doesn't cut it. Looking forward to expansions to mix things up even more.

After one play: Seems like an excellent example of a complex, meaty worker placement game. Tight competition for useful actions combined with multiple ways to score, and the eternal choice between actions that get you points now and actions that improve your efficiency for later, make for interesting and difficult decisions.

RATING: 6.5
Lowered the rating... There seems to be 1 or 2 main strategies/paths that you mechanically follow in order to win/place very well. Had played the game once or twice some time ago and now one player that knows the game well did exactly that: he followed consequently, and in a way that I find extremely mechanical, a strategy (if you can even call it that, because it is basically to get the 9 locomotive and the Kiev star), and won a landslide victory. After the second round, it was very clear that he would win by a large margin, which made the game extremely boring.

RRR is a very conservative, but excellently designed and balanced worker-placement Euro game. The interaction between players is limited to the worker placement and snatching good spots away.

In the game you advance on 4 different tracks (3 railroad tracks and 1 "industry" track). Each track is unique in the way it awards VP and gameplay bonuses (early VP vs. late VP; low VP + high bonus and vice versa). At first the game may seem to be a victory point salad (which is somehow true), but what you do is not arbitrary. You rather have to stick to your strategy, which is selecting some tracks to work on (you cannot do all). The order in which you work on the tracks matters very much and the key is to use synergies between those.

There is no luck and only little variation in set up, but  I think trying out different approaches offers some replayability. RRR does not force you to do anything and gives you much freedom in your strategy. It does not do anything innovative, but the gameplay has a very good flow (as a said: a well designed game). The scoring at the  end of each round is  a bit fiddly, but is not detrimental to my enjoyment of RRR. 

Gameplay is pretty  much abstracted from theme. I like how the different tracks represent better developement of the network and the track tokens only represent the frontier of the network (elegant way of representation) and that there is a separation between your network (tracks) and service (trains). But the bonuses for achievements on the track have no thematic representation (why can you only build premium tracks when you have advanced the Transsiberian track?); but these bonuses are the core of gameplay and give rise to the different strategies. The main source of victory points are track and industry advancements (so far thematically sound), but these are accompanied by multipliers, arbitrary end game bonus cards, turn order bonuses and engineer bonuses. While this guarantees the good balancing between strategies, it is a thematic  disconnect and the reason for RRR to be marked a "point salad". However, Soviet Russia is one of the very few settings, in which an economic game without any money makes sense! (These coins are not really money!)

Players have four interacting development tracks from which they score points. These tracks are advanced by placing workers on spaces on the central board each round and points are scored at the end of every one of the seven rounds. The game is challenging and fun and the components are very good but I've only rated it a 6. To me the game had a problem with its scoring, and that was the arithmetic. Each round you have to add four usually two digit numbers to an existing two digit number. The strain of this showed on even quite serious players who just weren't use to doing that in their heads. And that would limit the groups I could play this with quite a bit.

RATING: 10
2013 was a year of many very good games (as opposed to 2012, a year of a couple of true greats but relatively few others which have become regularly played for us), but this for me is easily the pick of them. What is perhaps most impressive here is that this is an intensely strategic worker placement game with absolutely none of the "I collect these resources, and then do x then y to convert them into victory points" which is found more or less explicitly in just about every other WP game. Instead, everything that happens here is all about scoring VPs, with no intermediate steps - pretty much everything you do is something which sets you up to score more victory points either in the end-of-round scoring phases or the end of the game. And yet what results is not at all a very mathematical or in any sense "solvable" game. There are several paths one can follow in this game, either exclusively or in conjunction with others, and at my current stage in learning the game (yes, I'm still very much learning after probably around 20 plays) it is not at all clear which approach is best.

I'm still quite excited to play this game, even though I played it more than a dozen times in just under a year since owning this, which is pretty frequent for us with any one game (and at all player counts - this works amazingly well with 2 players, another rarity among worker placement games). And I've played it several times since, without getting bored. Perhaps it is possible that, despite each game differing in the available engineers and which scoring cards are in the game, there may eventually prove to be just one path which needs to be followed to get the best possible score. But I don't expect to ever reach this stage, if it exists, so it's really only a theoretical problem for me. This is a game whose appeal is difficult to describe succinctly to someone who hasn't played it, but anyone who enjoys Euros ought to at least give this one a try - it's unique, deep, and tremendous fun.

(+) One of the best engine-builders I know
(+) Smooth gameplay
(+) Little to no downtime, game takes about 30 min to explain and 2 hours to play: very reasonable to me
(+) Interesting mechanics: Due to different engineers some options will be different every game. The game also supports multiple strategies increasing replayability
(+) Nice components

(-) As this game is in its very core a very sound engine-builder, it is possible for an early leader who gets the job done in the most efficient way to emerge around mid-game, leaving the other players behind uncontested on the victory points track. Personally, I don't really mind this issue - a good engine builder can be unforgiving in my opinion, I like the fact that this game doesn't help ineffective gameplay by adding randomness.

Approx gametime: 30 - 35 min / player

Simply love this game. One of the best Euros out there. Multiple paths to victory, lots of things you want to accomplish, limited number of moves and competition with the other players makes this a tense, moderately thinky game, that will test both your planning and adaptation skills. Short versus long-term planning is strong with this game - do you go for quick points from the start, or big points that will require multiple combined steps? And will you be able to accomplish all those steps without someone blocking you on the board? You must also be flexible in this game - the actions you were counting on *will* be blocked by other players (a la Ticket to Ride), and you'll have to improvise and adapt as you go.

If all this sounds good to you - you MUST get this game. It is 90 minutes of pure fun, tension, and very satisfying engine building. 

Of course, this game is not for everyone. There are lots of things you'll want to do, and not enough time to do them all. You must optimize each step, which can be AP prone to some. Also, your plans *will* be tampered with (it's a tight worker placement game) which can be frustrating if you're a long-term planner who puts all their eggs in one basket. You must remain agile, and quickly formulate new plans on the go to do well in this game.

Summary: This is an excellent, excellent Euro for the medium-to-advanced player. It combines everything a Euro gamer could want - suspense, planning, good player interaction, beautiful artwork, and lots and lots of points. And as if that weren't enough, it has some very good expansions by now that just make it even more fun and exciting. Highly recommended game.

A worker placement game that I feel plays quickly and keeps all players engaged as everyone races up an ever accelerating points engine.  Several ways to gain points and several way to combine actions and effects to harness even greater points make for a thoughtful game.  Can't do everything, but are you doing enough to beat the others?

A rather indistiguishable worker placement game if you think about it--most of the choices are move marker down the track.  Eventually that will earn additional markers to move, bonus tiles, etc.

Not really bad, but nothing innovative for the genre.  And no real flavor of being a railroad game.

Pretty heavy Euro - pretty loose theme and lots of ways to get points, but 2 main paths - lots of track and/or lots of factories. Winning scores are in the 300's or 400's, so lots of points - it makes getting 3 here and there feel a bit meaningless even though final scores might be close.  Definitely interested in trying it again, but no huge fun factor for me.

Russian Railroads is not your common railroad game. In Russian Railroads players score points by laying types of track down on certain lines in RussiA each line gives you specific points or advantages. Players use workers to claim actions on the board that advance your diferent railroad pieceand allow you to purchase different locomotives. This game is a pretty deep euro where scores compond every round and the options are enless and divers.

Pros:unique gameplay mechanics, fun worker placement implementation, ability to create your own end goals and bonuses.

Cons:longer playtime.number of different choices can be ovverwhelming, long playtime.

This thing just pukes points everywhere. The first turn or two is a little slow, but once it gets rolling, you can be making triple digits worth of points every turn and there's so many places to do so. The choices here are not what is the least painful, but which level of awesome do I want?

Normally, this type of game turns me off of it as it tends to rob games of tension, but it's hard not to get caught up in the sheer joy of swimming in points here.

One play.  It was a fairly solid worker placement game, and I enjoyed the play, but it didn't really leave me wanting to play again.  Wouldn't turn down a game though, as it was quite enjoyable, and I'd like to try some different strategies.  My problem with it is that it very much feels like you have to choose your strategy for the game before you start and then execute it - I prefer more reactive games, but this game didn't feel like you had that option, as to score VPs you really need to go very deep into a particular strategy.

A fine example of a 'build your engine' type of game with many little innovations regarding the component and mechanic design.

After another play I see that there is not much strategy in this, few choices on the beginning and more important you must adapt it during the game constantly reading others play. I rise my score to 5,5 :-) with potential to have 6 in some time.

There's something sort of masochistically compelling about knowingly playing a game that rejects theme and is all raw, unadorned point-gathering.

Not a lot of theme. Not a lot of player interaction beyond the usual worker placement getting in the way, but really everyone is just doing their own thing. Lots of choices. Place your workers to perform an action that lets you trigger another action that lets you trigger another action that bumps up your victory points either immediately or at the end of round scoring or at the end of the game. It's interesting to see who will come out on top through which path. Sort of like a more brain melting Castles of Burgundy, but without the uncertainty and excitement (mild as it is), of the dice rolls. Lots of tiny little decisions all add up to see if you were the most efficient at the end of the game. The fun bit is in chaining up a series of big payoffs in the one turn. Yet, it's a bit sad that that's the "fun" bit.

A solid, well produced game with a delightfully easy to follow rulebook. Engineer distribution, a couple of random bonus cards not starting each game and, of course, different player moves will mix it up a tiny little bit between games. You'll want to play again because you see a way to improve, but all that counting and calculating maybe ultimately makes it more suited as an online or iPad game.

Good to explore, then explore a bit more, then find something a bit more fun, interactive and thematic to play afterwards. Playing against players of different levels of experience is going to be a problem in this one... if you find close games to be more fun. The good news is that you really only know for sure who won right at the end.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
RRR isn't perfect, by all means. It is very dry, the posterchild of pasted theme; unintuivite (colored rails, really?) and the rules are tricky to explain (and understand) because of the multiple points that rarely actually occur in the game, but make a big difference when they do (yeah, I'm looking at you, bonus chip with 2 cards on it). And don't get me started on the scoring system...

Now that this is all out of the way, I can say that RRR is one of my current favourites. It scratches every itch I have about boardgames. The weight is just right, as is game length (60 min), complexity (medium), replayability (huge, at least in the beginning), player interaction (higher than it seems at first sight) and randomness (brought by random setup and other players actions, instead of luck).

Way to go :)

A wonderful game. Right up my alley. Resources are tight, and you have to be wise about where you focus your strategy. It's a great little puzzle to figure out how to solve the problem of when to move which tracks: you want to move out your browns, but the gray tracks are in the way, which are also being blocked because you don't have a way to move your black track markers along. And you really need to get an upgraded locomotive, but you don't have enough actions left. Really well done game that my wife and I both enjoy quite a bit.

Russian Railroads is a fun VP engine game. Focus is rewarded, and if you don't have an idea of how you're going to score points, you won't do well. The game is all about setting yourself up and completing short term goals in order to give yourself long term advantages while competing over the more efficient action spaces. You score the rail and industry tracks every round, which means that scoring in the late game scales up enormously. Actions are very tight in 4 player.

German Railroads drastically improve the variability and strategic diversity of the game. The German boards give you asymmetric boards that emerge as you play, and incentivize pushing multiple tracks. Coal increases the variability, allows you to accomplish more faster, and strengthens industry.

This is a pretty straight forward worker placement game with railroad theme (note this is not a train game). The game plays fairly quickly and has a lot of interesting choices to be made with many paths to victory. Just like every other worker placement euro, choosing a path no one else has chosen and sticking with that path seems to be the best way to victory. The game does not seem to have too many variables (only differences are which engineers come up) but hopefully offers enough replayabilities as, like I said earlier, there are many paths to victory and often times you won't be able to take the most efficient actions due to other players blocking that action.

As a disclaimer I generally dislike worker placement games, but there are a few exceptions that have appealed to me, and since I'm a sucker for a train theme I was thinking this might be one of them. Nope - probably the only train themed game I've actually hated. More theme-challenged "put a bit here, then another here, in order to do this, which then lets you do this, which then lets you score points" crap. Pretty sure if I ever want to railroad in Russia again, it'd be with something like 1861: The Railways of the Russian Empire.

Played two 3P and two 4P games so far. Russian Railroads is a worker placement game with a minor novelty – it ditches the usual resource conversion system in favour of pushing markers along four different progress tracks. It's a fairly novel system as there are tracks within tracks, and players will need to overcome bottlenecks to push their markers further. The problem, however, is that there are a few dominant paths to scoring. So dominant, in fact, that to deviate slightly will incur penalties. So players will deal with competition for players over certain actions, and maybe adjust their plans a little now and then, but otherwise little in the game will require players to deviate from the scoring paths they have chosen. 

Something also unique to Russian Railroads is that scores [i]will[/i] snowball to absurd amounts by the end of the game. It was pretty exhilarating the first time it happened, but the novelty wore off with progressive games because the scoring system was so prone to miscalculation. 

Once the game's appeal of exploring the few scoring paths available wears off (and it will eventually), you're left with a fairly standard worker placement game.

At first glance it looks mad, but it's deceptively simple. And it's also good. However objections have been made that once you set off on a particular path you need to stick to it rigidly, as any deviation results in defeat. I concede this is true, but it doesn't negate the game entirely. What it does do is place a huge premium on turn order.

#97 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

A worker placement game that seems to have a lot going on, but it's actually pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it. All the mechanics work together well and have been presented in a light that was new and interesting to me. This game is all about victory points and boy do they add up quickly with scores often reaching over 400 points. I wouldn't be too surprised to hear if someone had scored over 500 points, but I haven't came close to that.

This is actually a fairly simple worker placement game to play, but there is a lot of interaction and combos between all of the different tracks, actions, and bonuses that's a bit more difficult to fully understand after just one play.  Despite that, there are clearly several different viable paths to victory.  The mechanisms are easy to understand and turns move quite quickly.  About the only time the game can slow down a bit is when somebody is trying to decide which bonus token or card to take, but that typically doesn't prevent the next player from going. The problem is that the other players might play so quickly that it's back around to the other player that's still trying to decide!  Overall, I enjoyed playing this game and would definitely play it again.

Played a game against one of the explainers.

Solid worker placement game. Nothing extraordinary, but well made.

It does however feel over before it really starts -- I had expected to get to develop a lot more track before the game is over, but being able to develop only a small fraction of it seems to be fairly normal.

And it does seem a [i]wee[/i] bit exponential to me; In the last round, I made 58 points, which is a number that just rings a bit too high for my ears. The game explainer said that his maximum on that weekend so far had been a final score of 318. I have a feeling that if the game lasted one or two rounds longer, scores would finally go to a completely crazy range.

Still, the game was the second out of three possible choices for a "large" game I might want to take home.

Agricola etetés nélkül. Nekem végig ez volt az érzésem játék közben. Sima munkáslerakós játék. A lerakásban érdekesség, hogy vannak helyek, ahova több munkás kell, illetve pénzzel mindig ki lehet váltani munkást, igaz 1 pénzszerzési hely van a játékban összesen, ezért ebből senki se fog dúskálni. 3 vágányt épít mindenki Oroszországban 4 fajta különböző fejlettségű sín felhasználásával. Minden vágány különböző dolgokat ad egyes pontjainak elérésekor. Ezen túl vannak még mérnökök, akik megvásárlásával külön akcióhelyet tudunk szerezni, illetve gyárak, amik beépítésével a táblánkba adott pillanatban adnak bónuszt. Fix 7 körös a játék.

This game is a solid worker placement game and the development of the tracks does make for some interesting decisions. What I think prevents me from really thinking this is an elite game is that there are really good actions, and you snatch those up as fast as you can, and then you have a couple of leftovers that you kind of throw out there. I just never feel that I could get good feedback on how well I was doing.

UPDATE: I don't know what it is about this, but I think it's a somewhat bland game where you're really racing for a couple of key objectives that give you a big jump on the rest of the players. This might be the first game I'm just really biased against because I'm now a seasoned, curmudgeonly gamer.

Expansions: German Railroads, American Railroads

Love this game! The accelerating scoring is great fun and trying to optimize what you're getting to pinch what you need for a victory is always a great time.

Russian - A great map, and the original that showed off how awesome this game can be. Unfortunately suffers a bit in 2-player as there's clear stronger actions that make the start of rounds feel a bit programmed.
German - Fantastic map and has super tough decisions even down to 2 players, I love the track sections you place on the board.
American - Really fun too, loved the double-industry tracks and the hefty points to be had from the bottom 2 lines. I suspect it may suffer in 2-player like Russian though.

1 play, 4er

Very good worker placement game, with a train theme thinly pasted on -- didn't feel it at all, although that might be because it was a learning game. There is a LOT going on here, a LOT to learn at once! 

The game was very enjoyable, but also had a bit of an odd engine-building mechanic: at the start of the game, you're scoring just a handful of points each round. On that final turn, you could be scoring over a hundred! Was there even any point in scoring those few little VP early on? Is there any hope at all of catching the player who manages to get ahead? Also, counting those VP every turn was a little annoying!

I'd like to play it again, but I may prefer Snowdonia if I'm looking for a train-themed worker placement game?!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 4 rail tracks (to 4 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:
- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.
- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.
- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP

The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 4 workers, will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:
- advance 1 or 2 track heads by 1-3 spaces
- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.
- earn 2 coins
- take 2 temporary workers
- jump ahead in turn order
- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you
- get an end-game bonus VP card

Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track line. On each line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white).

After 7 rounds, the game ends; most VP wins!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I actually really liked this game up until about halfway through it.  Loved it, even.  I'm a huge worker placement fan and loved the mechanics of this game.  It seemed well designed with a lot of options, interesting player interaction, and thinky ways to play.

The friend who introduced this game to us even described it as a game where instead of someone screwing you over with a selection they really just divert you but you still have a decent option available to you.  Boy howdy was he wrong!

About halfway through I already started to see the mold on this game's design.  That being that it had a serious runaway leader problem.  I was even the beneficiary of this design mistake but I don't like feeling like I've run away with a game halfway through.  The tension is gone in those situations and the game becomes less exciting.  I was able to "min-max" my board and by ignoring certain tracks and actions was outscoring my opponents by 30-50 points a turn.  By the final turn I was 80 points ahead of my next closest opponent and "lapped" both of the other two players (scored over 100 points more than them).

The final turn is what really soured the game on me though.  During this game a player accumulated 6 out of 7 of the engineers in the game.  These engineers are powerful enough, they give the player who acquires them an action that only they can use.  However, without acquiring these I was still able to make optimal action selections and outscore my opponents every turn.  My whole mentality was that acquiring these engineers wasn't overwhelmingly beneficial to this player because a. he was still limited by his worker total and b. not all of the engineers provided optimal action spaces and many went unused for several turns.  I repeat, boy howdy was I wrong!

Well, not necessarily wrong, I just didn't know about one particular piece in the game that would gift-wrap the win for this player after a 2-3 hour mental exercise.  There are four available factories in the game that let you score 9-16 points for each of your engineers.  With 6 engineers and two of these factories the player was able to score 114 points in the middle of a round when our end-of-round scoring capped out at 90-100.  This is insane.  Sure, we were punished for allowing him to accumulate so many engineers but the punishment did not fit the crime.  Nobody wants to spend 2-3 hours playing a game where even with a comfortable lead they can be buried by one turn, to me that is a huge design problem.

I have to admit (begrudgingly) I did enjoy most of the rest of the game and knowing now about this quirk I would play it again taking care to make everyone at the table aware.  But I would also be remiss without criticizing this game for what I think is just a bad design element.  Maybe games like this exist for players that like the ability to take advantage of broken hidden mechanics like this, but I'm not one of those players.

Lately this game is getting a lot of press and every time I see it I think about how much I enjoyed (loved, really) the parts of the game that weren't the broken points-for-engineers tiles.  I definitely want to play this game again (and may even purchase a copy) but never again will I let it go unknown how important not letting one player accumulate the majority of engineers is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Lots of choices to make in an abstract train game that apparently works very well (played it once, only).

I would prefer a bigger evolvement with the theme because I feel that I'm always only pushing a piece further every time I perform an action. What happens next changes the game but that change is merely numerical, not structural as I would prefer. And the amount of VP bugs me a bit but that's just me being picky.

Overall I enjoyed the game quiet a lot and I think it's one of the best 2013 games I played, so far.

Expecting a train route game and getting a worker placement game but one that I fairly enjoyed. I like that you sort of play on 2 boards, the one where you place the workers to secure the action and then you personal board where you perform the action. As in most WPG you have to make choices because you will never be able to do everything(therefor specialize). And as in most WPG there is probably one best strategy to win but the game should be plenty fun until you find that one strategy and lose interest.
Playing it on yucata, it did grow on me (WPG do that to me), I stink but I like playing it. The beauty here is that even if you play well there is no way way you ever get to do everything you want to do before the game is over. Better with 3 or 4 than with only 2 players.

Rules read through

One of the best rule sets I have read clear consice and even encourages the reader to take a break after page 15 :)

It's a worker placement game with a railway theme. The only xx element is how locomotives come into the game. Te choices look bewildering, especially as there are so many triggers for secondary actions or scoring. This looks a little Feldian to me but will see how it works in practice.

------------------

1st play 2 player. I hope it's better with more. Basically felt like an abstract WP game where you go up 4 tracks (they could be any thing) with lots of chained actions and 'if I score this bonus I get 48 but with this I get 40 oh wait thank means player x gets 34 ......'. There are lots of buttons to push and paths to explore. So underwhelmed on first play but suspect better with more players (so long as none of them have AP.....)

-----------------------

I just had a thought about how Russian Railroads could have been made more 'representational'/thematic - Rather than have the stupid different colours of track following each other up the track they could have started with a surveyor (Black track), then dug out the land (the grey track), then laid ballast (the Brown), then track and signalling (the white). It would then have a passing resemblance to how a railway is built and I would have felt a little more engaged with the process.

Helmut Ohley and Lonny Orgler are known primarily as 18xx designers, and I rather suspect that Russian Railroads started as an exercise in abstracting out the 18xx train rush. If so, I'd love to know if it was their idea to strip out rusting -- i.e., that which makes a train rush interesting -- or if it was Hans im Gluck relentlessly polishing all the sharp edges away in the name of being family-friendly.

The gist is that players score points by advancing markers along three tracks, representing railways; however, points are only scored (and most special spaces activated) if the player has a suitable locomotive assigned. The 2-trains activate the first two spaces on the track, and have to be purchased before the 3-trains, which activate the first three spaces, all the way up to nine.

Trains are acquired and tracks are built with a lot of banal worker placement: there's not much train DNA left, despite the theme. There's competition for the central spaces, sure, but it hews dangerously close to being a solo optimization puzzle. That said, as a worker placement engine building blah blah blah it is truly excellent, and if that kind of game interested me I would be thrilled. It is probably the best such since Tzolk'in, but with a longer-term focus due to the necessity of committing to a strategy relatively early.

7.5 -> 6 (this just isn't the sort of game I like these days, and even the smoothest multiplayer-solitaire worker placement game is still what it is)

In a good economic game things are going to be a little complex.  This is a lot complex.  Many things can happen and the complications that arise from some actions are novel and gnarly.  Perhaps the rules with familiarity will ripen and Russian Railroads will find its groove.

Raw worker placement / track-development / trigger bonuses / action-optimisation type game.

I'd happily play this occasionally, but despite [i]really[/i] attractive art & production values, I don't think I'll buy a copy. I suspect games would become samey, and sticking to tried & tested strategies will always triumph over trying something different.

I can't help but think that moving different colour [b]tracks[/b] along a line kind of misses something fundamental about how railways work.

Good game but feels a bit scripted for the first few actions per turn (Engineer -> 2 Gold -> 2 Workers). The balance also feels a bit off with the 9 train upgrade something people seem to rush for and do extremely well with in comparison to other offers. Besides that it is still a good game but I think the expansion makes it into a great game by opening up the strategy a bit more.

It is clearly a well designed game, with many interlocking scoring opportunities. 

However, to me the fun in this game seems to come from figuring out this engine. As soon as you got that down, where is the replay value?
I see not much (none?) hidden information, no 'surprise tricks' that can be pulled, no luck factors influencing how each game goes... 

Only interaction seems to come from 'I take that spot and now you can't' type worker placement style. Been there, done that.

This, topped with the fact that it is already clear you are losing in mid-game... it might be BGG Top 50 because ratings aren't normalised across gaming categories, but it won't secure a spot in my collection. Pass.

Eventually I'll provide expanded thoughts here.  This game is very enjoyable and I'm glad it plays well with 2.  I like the standard worker placement board and the building of your own little world.  I kind of feel like I'm playing a little point making toy rather than a point making spreadsheet like some recent euros.  That makes it fun.

This game was quite high on my list. It's one of the heaviest titles by HiG. It's from the designers of [thing=76417][/thing], an other train game (with a different theme though) that I enjoy quite a bit. And this was one of the titles getting a lot of buzz this year, so I had to grab a copy.
The rules are the way you've come to expect from HiG: VERY clearly structured, written and layed out. One read of the whole book is enough to explain the game straight away with no questions coming up. Very, very well done. And luckily the game is just as well developed. Everything is very clear and very straight forward. But the combinations do offer multiple strategies to explore, lots of different ways to score points.
I was also pleasantly surprised by the duration which was about 1h45 with 4 new players.
So far this is my favorite of the 2013 Essen crop and I look forward to exploring it more in the near future.

I'm not huge worker placement guy, but this one is ok. I think the base game suffers in that depending on the variable setup, certain strategies may not be as viable as others, which makes this a little less enjoyable. There is also a fairly limited set of approaches and a lot of the game comes down to the art of navigating turn order the first two rounds. 

(though I've only recorded two plays, I've played a fair amount on yucata.de, so my opinions on the game are not based on just a couple impressions).

This is the type of worker-placement game I enjoy. Russian Railroads provides a tight focus on just a few point-scoring opportunities harnessed by limited resources. This is opposed to the contemporary Feldian school of design where there are a multitude of scoring opportunities scattered all over the board.

What's more, Russian Railroads plays relatively quickly. I appreciate the recent trend in many worker-placement games towards shorter playing times. Glass Road and Keyflower also come to mind here.

Finally, Russian Railroads has a clever system that is reminiscent of base-running. You can't advance one runner (track type) past another, but the more you can advance the runner furthers back, the more points you score. Clever.

Subsequent plays only reinforce my feelings about the game even if there are certain set strategies that emerge. As with similar games of its type, player interaction is low and so there is a limited shelf-life to the game. As people settle into their preferred method of scoring, you'll need to spice things up by either moving on to another game or adding the expansion.

A decent worked placement game, but nothing special differentiate it from the sea of worker placement games out there.  This isn't really a "train game" and the train theme is marginal.  I don't anticipate playing it enough for this to be an issue, but there is almost no variability between games, so replayability could be poor.

The theme kept me from trying this for quite some time, but as I am a big fan of worker-placement games, friends eventually convinced me that I simply had to try Russian Railroads. As I initially suspected, the dull and drab theme definitely doesn't help this one. It also felt more mathy and bean-counterish than I like in games. There's definitely enough going on here that the game is challenging, but the zero fun factor means this won't get many plays from me.

Half a game in and already one can see that Russian Railroads continues what Hansa Teutonica, Terra Mystica and Tzolk'in achieved as of recent: Give the modern Euro a refreshing feel on an elegant level while not providing all that much innovation (well, scratch Tzolk'in on the innovation part)but everything's so perfectly intertwined.Maybe its most prominent feature is the lack of resource cubes and thus the absence of cube-pushy conversion frenzies. There's just a great flow to this game, you get the hang of it fast (so playtime might actually be what the box says it is) and there sure are lots of different strategies to approach. Great rulebook and great artwork on top and for once I really don't care wether or not the theme is pasted on rather than captured in the game.

This was the first worker-placement game I ever played, and I love it!  It's quite the brain-burner (which is why I haven't taught it to many of my friends yet), but my wife and I played this a lot when we first got it and will still pull it out now.  I was initially worried that the game would feel a little same-y after so many plays, but the engineers change every game, and that's enough to try out new strategies…strategies that will typically be derailed because "GAHHHH, I WAS GONNA PICK THAT SPOT!"

Despite it generally being a game I wouldn't enjoy (aka heavy Maths and minimal interaction WP), I love this game and cannot get enough.

Just a fantastic exercise in engine building. Points have a very fluid exponential increase as the rounds pass by.

Plays fast and is so damn fun.

This is a complex worker-placement game that involves compounding scoring each round. Adding up scores gets pretty out of control by the final 2 or 3 rounds. After my first play, I couldn't wait to play more to discover new strategies. But after 4 plays, it seems like the winner usually does pretty close to the same thing. More plays will tell if it gets same-y.

First Impression:

A simple worker placement game, refined and polished to an outstanding level.

There is little I can say about this game's core mechanisms. The basic worker placement works very well, with great player interaction that feels just right and tight decisions. There are clear diverging paths of strategy, and players may pursue many of them at varying order in their quest for victory. Most importantly however, this game flows extremelly well, is easy to teach and play and forces constant tough decision making. In short, it's elegant, very elegant. Finally, there is a clear sense of progress and the game doesn't really outstay its welcome, feeling just right in duration.

The game does little to boost its theme, but despite this and myself (I don't really like the train themes in general) the theme carries, even if weakly. The multiple railway layers and the gradual railway progress are intuitive enough, as well as the engines and the gradual introduction of better ones. There are great abstractions of course, but overall it's much less dry than I first assumed.

Overall this is a euro that fits almost perfectly to my preferences. It has simple yet very strong and rewarding mechanisms and a theme that manages to carry through. I look forward to play it more.

If you're expecting a standard train game, this ain't it.  There's no route building, no pickup and deliver, there's no competition to get anywhere.  It's a multiplayer solitaire worker placement point salad game... and it's brilliant.

You're buying trains, factories and engineers and laying track.  There's all sorts of bonuses that trigger when you've got track built to them and a train that can reach that far.  And once you've started building your track, you can come along behind it and start upgrading it... which means it'll score better.  There are three main strategies, go for industrialization and build factories, hire all the engineers, or build tracks and trains.  Although to be honest, you'll probably do a little of everything.

Things start out slooooooow.  But by the end of the game you'll be speeding along.  The game really does a great job of making you feel like you're accomplishing something by the end of the game.  This isn't a game where you feel like your last turn is just eking out a point or two.  About a third of my score came from the last turn.

This was one of the best new games I've played in a while.  I fell in love with this one.

About [thing=144733][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=144733][/thing] is a strategic work placement game in which players try to build their points machine better than the others. Once the set up is done, there is no more randomness in the gameplay, allowing players more control over their destiny and paths to follow.

There is a good learning curve working here as there are many options and interconnections between several parts, as well as timming to make some advancements and/or build factories and getting new locomotives or upgrading them. This all means that an experienced player will likely trounce any new player and won't even have a hard time doing it, as a proven strategy will likely work again and again, with only a few minor changes and corrections along the way.

The production value is good: the bits are nice and the tokens do their job. The art is merely OK but the graphic design is pretty neat, making the options clear and playing easier.

Replay value can be an issue: the only random part is the order of the engineers during the set up. Therefore, plays can follow the same beaten path and the offer few new decisions - it will be up to the players to truly challenge themselves.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Play will last for a given number of rounds (7 or 6). At the start every player will have 5 workers to use, but can gain more by unlocking one or two during play, or hire 2 more for a round, using one of the options on the board.

During the turns, players will allocate their workers and use the spaces on the board. Several advance the development of tracks - moving black, grey, brown, cream or white markers. Others will advance the industry of the player, get money, extra points, new factories and new trains. It is possible to hire the available Engineer, and use the next two that later will be up for hire.

All spaces, except for one that allows players to advance a black or gray marker, once used are blocked for the whole turn. Hired Engineers give extra places for positioning workers, only available for the players that have them.

Turn order is also changed by the use of workers - the ones used to do this can he reallocated once everyone have passed.

A player without workers and money (as money can be used as workers) must pass - receiving some points if playing in 2nd, 3rd or 4th. Once everyone have passed and the workers in the turn order (if any) reallocated, the round is over. Players tally their points - gray, brown, cream and white markers are worth points, if their positions are "activated" by a locomotive - for instance, a track with a 6 Locomotive is activated up until the sixth spot on it. Some tracks give extra points and the industries, accordingly to how advanced they are, also scores each round.

Once the game ends, everything will be scored as normal, as each end of round, with the addition of goal cards, if the player has any of them, and the Engineers: the player that hired more of them will gain 40 points and the second, 20. 

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are plenty of them:
- Where to allocate workers;
- What tracks to develop;
- Deciding between Locomotives and factories;
- Picking bonus tiles;
- Etc.

Players usually need to focus in a strategy, meaning that, although there are many choices on the board (and Engineers), prioritizing give the player a way to restrict options, though being able to seize good opportunities can provide an edge. Alongside prioritizing, timming also puts weight on the decisions, as unlocking some tracks, taking early some bonus, grabbing first a goal or an Engineer, also counts a lot.

Therefore, although the options available aren't truly complicated, the many aspects involved in each of them, and the lasting effects of them, adds difficulty to decide.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Pacing - plays usually lasts around or under 90 minutes, even when having 4 players;
- Nice range of options and decisions;
- No random aspects, allowing for strong strategies;
- Excellent graphic design and nice components.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- No direct interaction;
- Learning curve makes playing with people of different level of experience dicey;
- Game can be over before the game is actually over;
- Dry and with little theme;
- Replay value can be an issue.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in soviet Russia where the trains ride you. Mainly because not even for a single moment I felt like I was building a railroad network or even a train game. I was, more, railroading - as the tracks where already laid there, and I only had to paint inside the lines.

Now, this can be a little harsh, as [thing=144733][/thing] is a pretty solid strategic game: you have plenty of options, no random elements once the game starts, relevant decisions and all put in a reasonable playing time with a fine pacing. Yet, [thing=144733][/thing] is also the sort of dry, solitaire and themeless game that I hardly can get into anymore - I still like very much some of these, but seems that the room for them in my preferences is getting smaller.

In the end, [thing=144733][/thing] has several strong positives, and even some of the "bad news" can be seem as positive to many players, specially those that like to develop their strategies and make their machines work with little interference, except some blocking. You probably know by now if you will like it, or not or be indifferent. I'm in this last group.

Beautiful components.  But will not stand up for repeated plays.  Not enough variation in game plays and there is no incentive to try different strategies.  Two strategies prevail - Transiberian w/ engineer and doubler purchases ( but use middle one track for the ? token) or Factories.  Put all your energy and time in that chosen strategy and deviate not -- after that it is strictly a race and efficiency game in which who gets what first.  Well, with the next German Railroads expansion and solo mode possibilities changes the game for me -- up ticked to 6

I really like this type of optimization game, and RR is no exception. My only concern with this game, is that it has limited replayability because of its deterministic and almost perfect information. That is why I have no desire to own it, even though I would gladly play it again.

I really need to play this with 4. With 2, it's not very compelling. Rating is based on potential.

Update: The mini expansion adds some pretty cool ideas. I quite enjoy it! I've also been testing out the rusting of trains but I still need to work out some kinks. It definitely makes the game a lot more cutthroat as people can get stuck and not be able to run lines every turn. It adds a really interesting dynamic.

Too many worker placement mechanisms, so the choices are many which might grind fluent play down to an excruciating exercise. Avoid German Railroads at all cost!

This might be a much better game than it was in my experience with a group of AP prone players so I could play again, but just with two because I hate downtime.

Good worker placement aspects, clunky scoring, paths for points seem based on obfuscation to make it hard to tell what to do, length is on the long side, some moves oddly scripted.  Overall enjoyable, tough worker placement decisions with an average wrapper around that.

I suppose we're building train routes in Russia or some such.  That's what the cover seems to indicate.  There are lots of tracks, I'll give it that. But they are of the victory point variety.

Good game but I just wasn't cheering afterward. I also don't see the playtime shortening with more plays and this game overstays it's welcome, something I don't see changing for the better with more plays. When first game took 2,5 hours after rule explanation with 3 players and we were not calculating the numbers of our "VP engines" until maybe the middle of the game, this can sadly only cause the game to get longer at which point any 3h+ good game is far superior.

Really enjoy this game. I love the engine building and snowballing scoring that can have you racking up huge points in the last couple of rounds. Even though the 2 player board is more restricted, I think this game still plays best with 3 or 4 so that there is more blocking happening.

RATING: 5
An elegant, well-implemented but bog-standard worker placement VP optimisation game.

No relevance at all to railroads, except the art, and the mechanisms (at least with two) discourage interaction. There were always enough action spaces to get what you wanted, and the challenge was in fiddling with your own player board.

If you like dry VP optimisation games where your opponent doesn't mess with your plans, this is the best out there. I was engaged while playing it, but felt it was all a bit purposeless and there was no need to repeat the exercise.

Played once, left on the shelf for a year. When we discussed playing it again, I realised I'd rather do two hours of work than endure this again.

The popularity of this game, even among my geekbuddies, is simultaneously astounding and depressing. I played it twice just to make sure I wasn't missing something. I just don't get what people are seeing in this game. It's like Splendor all over again. I'm not saying RR is terrible but it doesn't do ANYTHING I haven't seen a million times before, and the decision-space just isn't interesting AT ALL. WTF?

RATING: 6
I like the idea of a worker placement/train game, but truth be told, this is really just a worker placement game with some tech trees on it.  The game could have been about anything (or even any railroad; there's nothing in the game that screams "Russia!" at me), but they chose this theme to make it seem more unique.  Most of the actions seem pretty basic, but adding the personal/variable action spaces make each game a little different.  I'm interested in playing the game some more, but it wasn't quite the game I was expecting it to be.

UPDATE: It seems like the engineers are critical to running a good game here.  That seems discouraging, since players have to waste moves to take suboptimal engineers, only so someone else doesn't wind up running away with the end-game and technology track bonus scoring (or maintaining a low locomotive so as not to discard any 1 factories).

I'm not sure I really get Russian Rails. It feels like pulling random levers on a slot machine. Sure, you can see the different forks on the road pre-printed on the game's player board and bonus tokens, but I have literally no idea what story it is trying to tell, nor what to look for when it comes time to decide what direction I should go.

It's just a flat out weird game. You'll notice I have played it quite a bit though, which seems odd considering the critical tone of my last statement. Well, like pulling the arm down on a slot machine, I can't in any way say it's not fun, regardless of whether or not I'm connecting the dots. It's like watching the flashing multiplier lights on a pinball machine ratchet up the score as three multiplier balls bounce chaotically around the playing area.

I don't get it, but I'm a sucker for the lights, so I'll probably play it a whole lot more. regardless of my complete lack of comprehension.

Thoroughly enjoyable to such a degree that the dryness doesn't really matter. It's not the dryness though, that keeps me from buying it. I think... it's just that it really is a straight-up optimiser, without a comedic component. Sure, Madeira isn't funny either... except I think it actually is, with pirates, also just how rigorous it is. RR is kind of easy, and I actually think that ultimately works against it - only slightly, mind, but enough for me not to want to teach and run it.

What I Like-
Many scoring options and strategies. Improving your player board feels like accomplishing something. Bonus cards for endgame scoring. 

What I Dislike-
Scoring tiebreaker for Engineers bonus based on otherwise meaningless number on Engineers. Was in 3 way tie for most conductors, one player got 40pt bonus, the other 20, and I got 0.  Big swing for what essentially was a tie in that area. Lost by 15 points that game.

Definitely tends towards the point salad (not meant derogatorily) school of games, which I normally avoid, but I quite like this one. In particular, I like that there isn't one approach to take, there are many different options and most of them are viable. It's worker placement, so you know what you're getting into there and I enjoy the tension of someone taking your space from time-to-time, it makes those actions just a bit more precious. I'm glad I own it (even if it was a trade) and I hope I can play it some more.

Currently, this game hits a lot of high points -easy learning curve (at least, to understand how the game works), tricky scoring tracks (reducing the "recipe" of the game), and some strain when making decisions.

I only have room for one railroad game. It is between this and Snowdonia. Maybe save up for both and have a playoff.  This is a strong contender. Love the game play. Racing to build the trans Siberian and other railroads with upgradable engines, and the frustrated puzzle of building forward the separate rail components while be efficient in point scoring. Another path is to build industry for Mother Russia.

A point-sallad machine, but I still enjoy it. The theme is just a facade, but the game mechanics is really solid. You need to like the math-side of games, and be able to try and maximize every decision to enjoy it - but if you do, you will enjoy it a lot.

The expansion gives the game more depth and makes it a more pleasant experience. There are now so many option that it can give you brainfreeze, but in a good way.

No luck beside the initial engineer setup. It is all about players interaction. There is no winning strategy, but you need to have one. You can't just randomly do things because the more you specialize in something the more points it will earn points. But you also need to stop your opponenent to get too much in its "speciality". I really love this game. It is better with 2 players than 3 or 4.

This game seems to have some promise, however my one play of this was in a loud bar.  Other customers were literally yelling at each other.  One of the other players in this game insisted on trying to be louder while speaking with a Russian accent and attempting to be funny (it wasn't working).  The rules were fairly loosely explained (by the half-drunk loud "funny" guy, so I was lost for at least the first half of the game.  I suppose I would give this game another chance.

RATING: 8.5
Based on one play, I'd say this is a very solid worker placement game. Those who find games like Agricola too depressing because of their fight-to-keep-your-head-above-water nature will enjoy this game because progress is only ever forwards, and exponentially so. 

My only worry is about whether repeated play would find the same sorts of strategies winning all the time. It seems like there are a lot of different things to go for, but it's tough to balance these sorts of games. On one play, I have no concrete basis for this worry, but I'd hate to buy the game and find that it's like Le Havre, where most of the choices are illusory and the only viable endgame is steel-centric (except instead of steel, here it would be e.g. everyone going for white rails, and the person who also gets the most engineers bonus wins, or something).

Rating updated to reflect my opinions of the game after playing the German Railroads expansion.

------------------------

I've been able to play this a couple times more recently now and I really enjoy it. It is yet another worker placement game in my collection but has some pretty interesting elements in it that other games in my collection don't have.

Some of the things that I enjoy are the the conductors that come out during the game and the fact that you can utilize their special abilities on the main board or can purchase them to personally gain their benefit from round to round. I also like the upgrading of your trains at they are required to reach objectives further and further down your tracks. Slowly upgrading the types of rail that you have in each of your individual tracks and points that they each give. The bonuses and industries that you can build... and how all of these work together, or if you're like me, against what you're trying to accomplish.

This is very much a euro-game through and through with tons of ways to pick up victory points. The strategy comes from figuring out the most effective way of picking up those points and evolving your strategy over time. Because I haven't played it that much and I tend to like to explore strategies in these games, I've generally be horrible at the game, but that hasn't stopped my enjoyment of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
I love this game the first time I played it, the only concern is the replay value due to the sandbox nature of the game. 

Once you know the better path to follow (wich rails to develop and wich combos to make) it looses the appeal. Need to play it more and maybe the expansions add new life to the game.

Also bothers me that usually the first step to make if you´re the first player is the money or the extraworkers. ALWAYS!

I really enjoy this game! I like the railroad theme and I hope as I play this more that there isn't a dominant strategy present. It certainly seems as if there may be one but I have yet to find it. If you enjoy games that you are constantly scoring a ton of points, you will love this! It is a very different worker placement game from your standard type of ones.

If you like Worker Placement games, Economic/Point snowball games and pictures of trains I think you can't help but like Russian Railroads.  I did find it a little odd that over half our scores came in the last two rounds in the game I played... and while making sure you counted every last point in those rounds was a tad tedious it was nice to have a little time to watch your engine work.

Got bored of it real quick --  and looking to squeeze every point out of the game, but well worth it.

An issue I have with this is that every game seems exactly the same, there seems one or two dominent strategies and that's it -- I don't mind playing it, its just that there is something missing for me in the game but I cannot put my finger on it.

Wonderful production and very sound game design. After first play, I'm quite sure there is a lot to be discovered in this game. However, it is quite serious and dry and only the last three turns are really interesting (first turns are rather 'programmed' since options are limited and the game systems takes some time to get into gear. See also: Macao). 

Probaby in the same league as the heavy Felds. It will take a few more plays to decide whether this one will push Macao or Trajan from my shelf.

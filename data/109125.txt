Far and away the coolest part of this game is the combat-cube-tower thing. I like the secret choosing of moves and the reveal moments as you hope that you don't get attacked in a critical province.

What keeps it from being an 8 is the fact that you can't move around much. It takes a long time to get to a target province, so if somone is scoring highly, you really can't do anything to stop them.

It was fun, and knowing more about it, I'll be more prepared next time.

Really cool hybrid between a light wargame and euro style action programming / construction game. Wally and Shogun are both awesome games. 

Love the cube tower--a beautiful gaming invention that runs on pure magic. Dislike how easily someone can get hosed in certain situations that leave them incapable of getting out of the hole they fell into. But that's a wargame for you.

Wally 2ed gets the 10/10 mark because it includes the available expansions in the box. I technically like Shogun's theme better. Either one + expansions is 10/10.

Really nice area control game. Really cool mechanic with the action-selection and that you don't know the order for all actions when planning. 
Also BETTER than Shogun (Tom Vasel, you're right!)

Wallenstein es una mezcla perfecta de wargame y eurogame. Es un juego de control de territorios durante la guerra de los 30 años en el Sacro Imperior Romano Germánico. 

Además del control de territorios, hay que gestionar los recursos: dinero y trigo, para reclutar tropas, construir edificios (palacios, iglesias y comercio) y lograr alimentar a los condados que se posean.

Por otro lado, es un eurogame, donde gana quien termine con más puntos de victoria (PV), estos puntos se dan por control de territorios y también con una mecánica de mayorías de cada tipo de edificación en cada una de las 5 regiones del mapa.

Las batallas resueltas con la torre de cubos está muy bien lograda, una pisca de azar que da emoción, pero no es tan descontrolado como los dados. Además planificación de acciones oculta, simplemente una maravilla de juego!!!

Shogun with a different map. Shogun was Wallenstein (1st Ed) with some rules tweaks and a new map. Now they have returned to the old map and brought in the extra rules of Shogun. Great game with very little down time, fast playing and a great system. I prefer the theme of Shogun.

RATING: 6
Compared to the first edition I can understand why they did away with the wooden money, but for me that was one of the cool parts of the game.  Also strongly prefer the superior colors and text on the older map.  The big downside was that the cards were in German.  I'm not sure that bidding for turn order does much for me.

The only improvement with the second edition is adding a scoring track.

That said, it does have the cube tower, and it is now clear so that you can see it while seated across the table.  While I prefer the first edition, I'll happily play this. (I give the 1st edition a 2 point higher rating.)

A very fun Euro style "war" game.  I really like how every action really means a lot because there isn't a lot of them.  I prefer Wallenstein to Shogun due to the map.  It's just a little more open preventing turtling.

Rating seems to be slipping every time I play. Disappointed by this game so far. The cube tower can be very random at times and this can hamper your game too much for my liking. I'm all for a bit of random in my games but I'm not keen on spending two hours playing a game where I'm everyone elses bitch due to not being able to win a battle. Will give it a few more tries to see if my opinion changes.

Okay I only played once and I thought it was great.  The rules are pretty easy to pick up on and it does truly offer some Euro elements with a little bit of fighting and area control.  I'm looking forward to more plays and adding in expansions to it.  The cube tower is very interesting way to resolve battles.  Only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 10 is because I prefer almost no randomness in my games.

May'13 Interesting game play esp the dice tower, don't think this game is everyone cup of tea but light wargamer might like this game. I guess I was a little disappointed as I was expecting more of it. Nevertheless, it's still a good game but it's long, not suitable for every gamer, must have the right group. Hopefully can try the expansion in the future and perhaps have a much more interesting perspective.

June'13 Hmmmm the more I play the more dissatisfied I get!

First play, although this is identical to Shogun (with the Tenno Court expansion) which I love. Still giving this an 8, but I find myself not liking longer games as much as I used to, and this clocked in very close to 3 hours. Still, we had 5 players and the game felt pretty brisk. Love a ton of the mechanics in this / Shogun, everything feels balanced with lots of good strategic choices to make. And it has direct combat, which I don't get enough of in the games I play.

Haven't played with the expansion, so basically it's pretty much identical to Shogun. The board is arguably better than for Shogun, 'cos there's more opportunities for conflict -- but I much prefer the theme in the original game. It shouldn't matter at all, given the rules are exactly the same, but I give Shogun a [9] for its theme whereas this one gets "just" an [8].

Simple.

Elegant.

...and still chaotic enough to make it hard to plan.


I'm really happy I had a chance to get this game. The planning in this game is really cool since you can only count on half of your actions. For the other ones it is unsure in which order they will be done. Very nice.

Well... this creates some cursing and wanting to shake that freaking tower when you get money AFTER you need it...for the second time in a row!

The visual appeal of this simple graphic design is the cube-tower which is used to resolve battles. Cubes can "hide" in the tower causing "see above" and can reappear some moment later in the game. I am a big fan of alternative battle resolve mechanisms and this is one of the coolest.

A thing I (normally) hate is bidding for player order. But Wallenstein offers a twist that makes it acceptable and even fun. The bids manage who gets to pick their bonus first but the bonus is randomly distributed to the player order every turn. So getting the wanted effect might result in a bad player order. Very cool.


Very cool game. Should be in every collection assuming you like area-control (or area control without focussing on area control).

I think it might be a good gateway game for risk-players, that is a little different and more complex without the rules going through the roof.

This game disappointed me big time! It was just way too random considering how long it takes to play. The rating for the actual gameplay is probably a bit higher, but the randomness in the game puts me off. Sure, I like games with minimal randomness, but I can enjoy a game with randomness in it - if it does not take at least 3 hours, which this game does! You can plan and figure out a good strategy, but in the end, the winner of the game can be the one who simply got lucky.

I'm not just talking about the cube tower which in itself is random; yes, I know, if you lose a round you’re more likely to win the next, but some of the combats are just more important to win when you’re planning for it. Oh, and the starting setup is so unbalanced it makes no sense – one player (the eventual winner) got lucky and had a bunch of his cubes in the tower, while I only got 1 stuck in the tower and the rest returned… That’s probably one of the worst starting mechanisms ever as it’s just plain unfair. I’m also not just talking about the order of the 10 action cards (and especially the 5 hidden) or the special event cards which are randomized and can be devastating. I'm especially talking about the end game scoring in which you most likely will miss some grain and therefore cause a revolt. This is handled by randomly drawing some region cards and hope those are not the regions in which you have some crucial buildings but only a few cubes, which means you might lose them due to the revolt. In my first game, the winner got very lucky with the 2 cards and the runner-up got very unlucky; if it had been the other way around, the second player would have won (and no, I wasn't the second player, hehe). Yes, this 100 % randomly card drawing decided the 3+ hour long game…

All in all, though the above-mentioned is of huge concerns to me, the rest of the gameplay is decent enough. But the amount of randomness is very high considering the game takes several hours as it's a game which makes you think quite a bit when figuring out how to place your cards. Not satisfying! Therefore, I have to give it a low rating (and while typing this I actually decreased my rating a bit).

Very evocative.  I'll need a few more plays to really come to any concrete feeling about the game but early reports are good.   The action system is smart...and punishing.  I'm a little fearful for players that get caught without cash-flow during critical moments but it seems like there are ways to prepare for that.  The cube tower is very cool.  It nicely evens out the combat results without feeling artificial.  The resource balance is sharp too, I especially enjoy how unrest is incorporated.

All in all, I'm excited.  We'll see if it fully lives up to expectations.

This is an incredibly solid game right off the bat.  The rules can seem a bit complicated at first, but then the flow takes over and it all feels incredibly natural.

Players are vying for various territories in the German empire, using light combat through a unique cube tower where some, but not all, the cubes will spit out - majority rules.  Meanwhile you're also trying to improve your areas economically by building palaces, churches and trading posts.  But the people must be fed!  And every time you tax them, they become increasingly hostile.

For a game with so much going on, I'm blown away by how accessible this game is - and it's just solid fun to boot.  Perhaps the components could use just a little tweaking (those building counters are very hard to see), but my quibbles are minor.  I'll never turn down a play of this game!

Wallensteins unique mechanics (diectower, collective planning phase etc), a permanent tension (where will my opponents attack, will I be able to get the taxes before etc) and the general blend of a euro with a bit of wargame makes this an outstanding game.

Rated this one a little too high to start. Still good, though.

I can't help but compare Wallenstein to El Grande -- cube area control with card play and some bidding. But where El Grande is so elegant, Wallenstein can be fiddly.

Don't get me wrong, though, I still really like it.

Wallenstein is a little more complicated to explain at first, and takes more set-up time, but once everyone's got it, it moves along. It creates some great decision-making moments, because you always want to do multiple actions in one country, but you have to decide which single action is best for now. There's also quite a bit of programming involved and second-guessing who might do what first and in which country.

The cube tower is the best part of the game and keeps everyone in suspense. It's great that you might get hurt by cubes getting stuck in one round, but benefit next round when they finally all come out. 

Despite its fiddliness, everyone is essentially doing the same actions (only in different countries and in different orders per round), but that can feel a little samey after a while. Still, the action order does make it feel like more of a unique puzzle each time.

This is the true granddaddy of early euro area control. Much better than El Grande!

Second 3p session, I'm crazy about this game. The tower can hose you but it's less random than dice and for some reason I actually like it. The fact that it has 'memory' is awesome. Great mechanism, not a gimmick. 

Queen is blowing out big box editions. I can't recommend it highly enough.

The classic game in new clothes. Sort of area majority Euro wargame, if you like. It's very tense and fun to play, the rules are really not very complicated for such a complex game, and as far as area majority goes, its head and shoulders above El Grande, which seems to be the benchmark here. The tower is an especially ingenious method for conflicts resolution, since it tends to even the odds throughout the game.

Second most tense game I ever play (beat by twilight struggle).  Has set actions available each turn where you decide where to take each action at beginning of turn.

I have more than 30 different Queen Games, there was a time I catched up nearly every output from Queen, but after they decided to go only into the high price market of games, I have to sort out a lot. Never I will go first, and never I'll pay the full price for any of their new titles... Still good games, some have to as well, but I can wait for the day they go cheap over the table.
Sorry Queen, but it was your decision.

Selling less games for a higher price, than to sell a lot, simply business decision, I understand, has nothing to do with your (fans) players...

One of the things I hate about Euro games is when someone is winning and there is nothing you can do. In Wallenstein, you can at least attack them every now and then and have an epic battle. The cubetowers are a hilariously awesome design and not as game-breaking as one might think (I won with about 20 of my cubes stuck in the tower once). That being said, the game does reward players for making smart economic decisions as well. Good balance overall.

I really have a thing for area majority games, and this one ranks right up there with El Grande in my opinion.  I played it a lot on Spiel by Web several years ago, but have only just played the actual board game in person, and it was even better face-to-face. There are so many things about this game that are just so cool: the careful planning that's necessary to get what you need without causing the peasants to revolt, the awesome cube tower that can seem to have a mind of its own (a minus in some people's eyes, but a plus in mine), and the fact that a good player has to gamble a little on what order half of the events each turn will turn up in.  People that gravitate towards games with perfect information may not care for this game, especially considering its length, but it hits so many of the right spots for me. I'm very glad to see it back in print and can't wait to bring it to the table again!

Wallenstein is a distant relative of Risk but much closer to something like Game of Thrones. Its two defining characteristics are the cube tower and the action programming mechanism.

The cube tower is a nice gimmick and serves as a sort of dice substitute with a memory. Its effect on the game as a whole is much smaller than one would think, however. The action programming sequence is much more important, and it includes a lot of guessing what the other players might do and even in which order certain actions are going to be resolved. With such a significant shot of chaos Wallenstein is a pretty long game. Much of that time, unfortunately, is simply spent on processionally advancing the game state rather than players actually deciding anything.

The 30 years war theme catches me much more than the japanese theme of Shogun. So despite of being almost the same game (except for the included expansions), Wallenstein is a clear, brain burning, winner over Shogun to me.

I've been wanting to play one of the games in the Shogun/Wallenstein collection for awhile. Really, I've just been quite curious to how the "cube tower" works and if it feels too luck-driven or it adds an interesting element to the game. I'd say it's probably not as random as dice, for example.  There's a good chance that most of your cubes will come out, but with almost equal matching between you and an opponent, it's almost too close to tell!  In that I think it works and it adds a nice, physical aspect to the game and I like throwing cubes down as an act of aggression! The game otherwise has a nice flow and I like planning for actions without knowing beforehand which order those actions will be resolved. A very nice idea! Otherwise, it's a quite straight-forward experience and didn't blow me away perhaps as much as I was hoping. But it all works well together and plays to a definite number of rounds, and I always like that aspect too.  All around a solid game.

Loved this game when it was Shogun, love it now that I finally own it as Wallenstein.  From a gameplay standpoint, the more uniform map shape, as opposed to the elongated map of Japan in Shogun, definitely has a different feel.  

The themes of both cover periods of history I'm extremely interested in, so I may very well end up alternating plays of these games in the future.  I don't plan to get rid of either.

I prefer Shogun's setting and theme over Wallenstein (Germany) - but only by a hair. The German map allows all players to reach one another more easily, which is it's best feature. Both are fantastic games and effective blends of euro mechanisms with some Ameritrash type confrontation. Keeping both for now, since the two different maps from either game give you a different experience (folks pay for expansions for the same game that include new maps- so this is essentially the same thing- but more shelf space required).

I have now finally settled my opinion of the Wallenstein-Shogun-Wallenstein game "engine", as it were.
-First, everyone at the table should internalize what it isn't--it ain't a battle game. It's a building game where your products and infrastructure are vulnerable. If you think of it as a battle game, the limited opportunity for fights and the relatively static map will irk you.
-Second, initial territory selection is key. Like Settlers, you can lose the game before it begins in earnest if your initial selection is poor. Fortunately, there is a recommended initial setup for new players.
-Third, the Court expansion is quite good. It adds very little to the playing time (maybe 5 minutes?) and helps mitigate the static map by making useless armies usable. 
-Fourth, it is best when played briskly. Very briskly. More briskly than people other than me seem capable of. When you've got possibly 5 at a table, the odds that someone will (almost single-handedly) drag what ought to be 90 minutes to 180 is high. This is sad. At a reliable 90 minutes, this is a very good game. I have yet to play that "version", however. 
The duration of the game is the real killer.

Area control game with a lot of direct confrontation between the players.Timing is critical, and you have to pick your battles carefully. Being too aggressive will drain troops and resources and prevent scoring during tha last rounds. The game requires balancing  money, food, building castles/churches and area control. Good game with some luck in card drawing and cubes passing thorugh the tower to resolve battles. 

This game has become one of the favorites in my gaming group. Despite some luck, players will clearly feel the need to plan ahead and develop long term goals.

Nice combo euro/wargame that is more euro than war and in a nice way.  Agonizing over which actions to take in which counties while trying to anticipate your opponents' moves is the heart of this game.  Maintaining your gains is as important, if not more, than expansion.

Some MORON has split 'Wallenstein' editions from 2002 and 2012 and I have to log all my plays under this entry :-/////

--

As for the game, this is basically 'Shogun' (its predecessor, in fact).  Not sure which setting I like better, but the map is clearly superior here.  The plays of 'Wallenstein' are much more dynamic and interesting, because of it (no turtling). 

Both expansions included in the game work really well.   The Emperor's Court increases the complexity of decision-making process by providing new options.  Fortunately not much time is added to the game.
Landsknecht (bonuses for being present in at least 4 regions) is a good encouragement for a dynamic/agressive play.
Play with expansions if you can.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Just a brilliant game. Its an area control game but the fun part is deciding which counties are worth something vs some counties that are worthless. The use of dice towers to resolve battles are a little luck driven but I can see how it mimics wartime uncertainty. Early stages of the game, the probabilities of cubes coming out from the towers are more predictable than later in the game. Some memorable moments are made when those odd results came from the cube tower. Will definitely play it again

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game and putting cubes in the tower and hoping for a good result can be a lot of fun. This game looks like a war game but if you go war-mungering you won't win. This is a more intelligent game of planning your attacks carefully and defending at the right times. Point are gained by owning places it is true but far more are gained by building buildings.... or taking them by force. 
The game plays Ok with two but better with three (haven't played with four or five yet).
Some drawbacks to the game are the hard to follow instructions that came with this addition. I found downloading some on line rules easier to follow and helped me understand the ones that came with the game. Also if you play with someone prone to analysis paralysis then you could find the game dragging.
Some of the games I have found myself wanting to stop after one 'year' of play instead of playing the full two 'years', but that may have been due to the late hour more than the game. Lots and lots of potential. ... time will tell.... so far though, it's in my play list.

1 play with 2 players. 
There are still a ton of bits but now I know what they are for and that's to make a really fun game. The basis is area control and the other player said "looks like risk" but there is no similarity.  The action order and then the selection is a great mechanism and being simultaneous,everyone is involved all the time. The auction for the player order is good but it's a little difficult to assess the value of being first although that may come with plays. The battles are fun.  the jeopardy of having enough crops is good but we spoiled it in the second year because we forgot to reset the track and remove the revolting peasants. Have not yet tried the expansion.

The first game I played that really delivered on elegant rules, exciting and subjective gameplay and historical interest without sacrificing much at all. It's a really tense game, deriving it's tension both from the threat of other players and the limited choices and resources at your disposal. And it has a dice tower. The worst thing about it is that although this is in no way a "multiplayer solitaire" game, too much time is spent individually placing your action cards for the turn to come when you could be actively interacting over the board.

Ottimo gioco! Longevità al massimo con le espansioni. Abbisogna di una piccola modifica riguardo le rivolte dei contadini: ce ne sono troppe e ciò nuoce al combattimento tra i giocatori. Noi abbiamo cambiato in questo modo: le rivolte avvengono (cioè si colloca un segnalino rivolta), alle azioni "raccolta grano" e "raccolta talleri", tirando 1d6 con un risultato INFERIORE al grano o ai talleri ricevuti.
Per il resto grande gioco!

More distinct from Shogun than I expected. Rather than bidding on turn order and small bonuses, the grain/event cards often target specific provinces. I can't say I like one better than the other. The shape of the map (the difference most people point out) did not make an impression on me. Very good!

Easily the best "limited" fighting/area-control game! The meeples fighting tower makes combat enjoyable. Great theme. And the play mimics the real life of the 30 Years' War in 1623-24. You can't just fight. You have to tax and feed. Beware peasant revolts. Make alliances. Or be crushed by them.

This feels like a grown up game of Risk to me. The range of actions and the variable order in which they appear works well and makes planning interesting.
The cube tower is superb and can produce unexpected results which just adds to the enjoyment of the game.
The only downside is that it is an evening filler, so players have to be keen to play a longish game which has a large random content.

[b]Wallenstein[/b] 2nd Edition by [person=60][/person]
3-5 players

Weuro game, Thirty Year War.

This new 2nd edition features two new expansions (Emperor's Court and Landsknechte) and has only 12 event cards instead of 25, and by using icons for each action instead of text allows for a multilingual edition.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1101657/differences-between-wallenstein-1st-and-2nd-editio

My question: Which is the better game? Wallenstein (the new updated 2nd edition) or [thing=20551][/thing]? Which is the better game? 

Preferences differ either over the game map (Wallenstein's Germany versus Shogun's Japan) or the theme (medieval Germany versus feudal Japan). Supposedly there are no other differences between the two games after adding the Tenno´s court expansion to Shogun.

RATING: 1
Wallenstein has hoodwinked boardgamers into thinking it is a game. It has done so by having all the same components of the standard boardgame, and by having many of the same problems of a boardgame like a long setup time with many fiddly bits and poorly laid out instructions where  important info is difficult to look up. 

The real problem with Wallenstein is the way the game limits the number of each available action and how they are chosen. Basically, all players do approximately the same number of all the same things each turn, the only variation being where each action takes place. The method of choosing each location is done by each player placing a card representing a province they own on a grid of each available action, once. No one is able to devote themselves to doing more of an action than the game permits, which makes play feel arbitrarily limited. This system both removes player's agency in the game and allows the now disinterested players to play completely on auto-pilot, choosing actions by just randomly placing their cards. Worse still, players on auto-pilot actually remain competition for the players still engaged in consciously choosing where their actions occur further highlighting how the arbitrary limitations of Wallenstein restrict players ability to do anything meaningful.

Even Wallenstein's famous cube tower lends itself to this auto-piloting as combat has been boiled down to taking either players involved armies and chucking them down the tower with the winner being decided by whoever's cubes spill out at the bottom.

In effect, all players could randomly play their cards down every turn, and watch how Wallenstein plays out like some kind of machine with zero player involvement. This is not a game! It is a box of parts that looks like a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The qualities of the components are nice, but not spectacular; the art is ok, but uninspiring and the graphic design is functional. The rules are so so (German translation).

It has a couple of very cool mechanics:
-> The combat resolution system: a cube tower.
-> The action planning system, with one action per territory and no duplicated actions; only 50% of the resolution order of these actions is know beforehand: you might not know if you'll receive the taxes before recruiting, etc.

And the rest of the game is quite average: the points are given accoridng a majorities system.

There is quite a lot of tactic and strategy in the game, but then the gameplay is very crazy. The actions of the other players can hurt you a lot. Basically, there are many things that can go wrong and you have zero control over them.

Also, if you lose some early battles and you are forced to give away territories, your game might be doomed.

I could enjoy a game as crazy/chaoric/random as Wallenstein, but it would need to be much shorter.

Wallenstein has the CUBE TOWER. That is the awesome! I remember playing the first edition with a few game designers and translated rules from the Internet.  When I saw this second edition I grabbed it. 

Components are excellent.  Rules are long and a little confusing.

Only played it two times since I got it, both times the games went long and players just got tired and stressed about it.

So perhaps I just haven't found the right group again to play it with?

Comment: This game just fired Game of Thrones for me. Way better, much quicker and doesn't feel quite as nasty. Also it's not just strictly war since it involves an economy and picking on the "weakest" player in this is hard to do given everything. The game is a bit fiddly, but it runs quite smoothly once you get going. Rules explanation for this game is a bitch. Everything works in tandem and it only starts to make sense once you get going. After a round, everyone is mostly clear about the rules.

REALLY loved the tower. Thought it was a brilliant mechanic to keep battles tense. Seriously, this is such an underused and underrated mechanic. It's just so damn good.

Optimal Player Count: 5 > 4 > 3

The more, the better. Nothing wrong with 3, but it gets more involved with 4 or 5. Will play with all player counts.

At time of writing, BGG didn't list it, but mine is actually the 'Big Box' edition with the three expansions.

This was a Kickstarter that turned out to be a year late - understandable for a small first-time games creator but inexcusable from a supposedly experienced company like Queen Games. You'd think they'd sweeten backers by throwing in some sort of compensatory extra (most obviously the stretch goal that wasn't reached) but they've offered nothing. I used to be a fan of Queen Games and have been a sucker for their Big Box editions (I think I probably had them all except Lancaster - all the components for which I have separately) but I shall probably give Queen Games a wide berth in future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As BGG hier says 'similar to: Shogun', I expected this game to have at least some tweaks on certain rules. However, they are COMPLETELY the same (I'm comparing the 2012 edition of Shogun with the 2012 edition of Wallenstein), so the only difference in fact is the map and that you have 2 expansions with Wallenstein you don't get with Shogun. I found this to be disappointing and I can't imagine someone would by Shogun if he has already Wallenstein or even vice versa.

Area control with 6 turns. All pre planned and then the actions are carried out in order they were dealt in. 

There is a lot of thinking and planning. A lot of fiddly bits. Actions and fighting carried out. I enjoy the cube tower for this matter. 

In general, it was a bit long for my taste and I won't normally play it. I enjoyed it enough where I will revisit it and since I own it I am sure that will happen.

In this game you get a hand of cards that match the areas you control. On your player board you have card slots that match the different actions that happen each round. During the preparation phase, you program those actions by placing the region cards on them, meaning the action will happen in the region you assign to the slot. The order of actions is randomized, and half of them are public knowlage at the start of the round. The rest get revealed as they happen. The game can feel complicated, but it flows smoothly as most of the actions can be resolved simultaneously. Combat is quick and interesting, as it involves dumping everyone's cubes into a tower and whomever has more spill out is the winner. The cost is that for every one of the defender's cubes that came out, the winner will also lose that many cubes. Cubes that retain in the tower will help you in your future battles. In this way you achieve a semi-random combat system, but the victum of this round's randomness has an advantage in future battles.

The one complaint about this game is the thing that makes it the most interesting. It feels like a dudes on the map game, on shuffle mode. You know where you want your actions to happen, but maybe someone takes that spot out from under you before it resolves. Maybe the order in which the actions happen makes it so that you can't afford the action you selected. Maybe the amount of grain needed to feed your spots at the end of the round is more than you planned for, and the peasants revolt causing you to lose spots. Maybe every combat you get into, both players tie and the spot gets wiped including the high value buildings you spent time making. I go back and forth being thrilled and frustrated.

[I like Shogun, the Feudal Japan themed Wallenstein a bit more.] Easily the best Euro game I have ever played. Simply fantastic. Players can achieve victory points through a combination of combat and building, giving paths to different types of players. So many great things going on in this game, I am awe of the design. I can't wait to play another game. Why not a 10? Maybe with more plays. The flaw I see with this game is that with only two scoring rounds, if you are behind by a lot after the first scoring round, it is very hard to get a win. You may end up playing kingmaker by focusing on the leader at that point.

Love this game with the inclusion of two expansions, bidding for player order, and score track.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(+) Nice blend of bidding, action allocation and area control (possibility to build 3 type of buildings) resulting in an interesting war game
(+) Board gets more interesting as game progresses
(+) Interesting course of the game: if you invest heavily in certain area's they make for popular targets. This dynamic works very well
(+) A certain level of luck dependence, but you can plan ahead for this to sufficient extent (you can assess possible outcomes with event cards, you see the first half of the order of actions, you have knowledge of what's left inside the cube tower, you know how much money your opponents have available, ...). This makes the game accessible for a wide variety of players, while still being appealing to 'hard core gamers'.
(+) The cube tower gives this game a touch of Vegas :) I like it! It's also a far superior mechanic compared to rolling dice, as previous misfortunes will increase your chances of being lucky in the future (however: if all your troops fall out in an unmeaningful battle it will force you to deploy this excess in an undesirable region). As all players are well aware of this, uncaring of whether your cubes are stuck or not, it will benefit you having the tower loaded with your cubes.

(-) It takes a long time to play Wallenstein: you only carry out 6 full action turns, but still... Don't expect this to be played in under 2,5 hours as a 4-player game. I don't recommend playing with 5.
(-) It should have been possible to create a more functional design for the game board: the name of the provinces are hard to read when the map gets loaded with cubes and markers and it would have been useful to indicate the value for coin and grain on the board. It's also a pain during the first half of the game to search for your counties using your county cards each time you plan or execute an action. This considerably increases the game time.
(-) In some cases, the game may muster up certain situations which are highly unfavorable for certain players and they sometimes can not be planned for. This creates a level of randomness I don't enjoy
(-) Your influence over the game might be a bit too limited, especially when playing with 5 players. The game tends to drag in this case.

Approx game time: about 45 min / player

02-02-2014. Nice area control game. Conflict is resolved with cube tower, in which cubes randomly stick. Can be swingy, but a fun mechanism. Rest is fairly standard.

I must say that it seems that for me, either Kemet or Wallenstein will take the area control fight to see which will stay. I guess maybe one may leave my collection.

Risk wasn't Risk anymore at some point--I just became bored by the monotony, the trite negotiations, the samey samey play...this took it all, shook it up and put it through a dice tower, and cubes of happiness came out. Have the 2nd ed, but don't play with the expansions so much, as the base game is good enough. Fight fight fight!

Technically, this is the same game as Shogun with the Tenno's Court expansion(s) included, but on a different map. Both expansions are rather small and don't change much in the game: landsknechte gives each turn an increasing reward for presence in at least four regions, while the 'court' expansion provides a way to turn our armies into courtiers, which can be spent to acquire favors (basically free actions). I don't like landsknechte as the bonuses are in my eyes too strong - it's not only a compensation for less strategical position of forces, but almost requires you to disperse your armies in order to get them, which increases the dynamics and chaos of the game by providing more options for attacking (more on that later). The court is better, because it finally deals with the problem of uneven starting forces in the tower - the cubes that fall out are transformed into courtiers, so your smaller military potential is compensated by more influence to buy the favors. It is possible to transform some armies from a province into new courtiers when you run out buy placing that province on a new order space, but personally I rarely use that option - it's not often that you have more armies you need in a province and don't want to issue there another order at the same time.

Because Japan is more spread out than Germany, the distances here are smaller, and regions usually have more neighbours, making turtling (a potential problem in Shogun in less experienced groups, especially with standard rule of picking from only two cards during set-up) very difficult and giving everybody more possible targets. Not only one can pick a weakest province to attack, but usually you border with all other players, so you almost always have possibility of bashing the leader, which was often not the case in Shogun.

This results in a more dynamic play, and while many prefer it that way, after a couple of plays in Wallenstein and a couple of dozen in Shogun, I prefer the latter, exactly because of more limited choices, in the sense that usually there are few combinations of orders assigned to provinces are that are visibly better than the rest. Shogun and Wallenstein, even more than most action programming games, require predicting what other players will do. The more 'good' options they have, the more difficult this predicting is, making preparing for most potential attacks almost impossible. This means that luck, or fruitful negotiation is a comparatively more important reason for not being attacked than proper build up of forces, making victory for the opponent less probable or short-lived.

Although my plays so far are too few to form a final opinion, my impression is that a better player (more efficient, better at double-guessing their opponents) have a higher probability of winning Shogun then Wallenstein.

A horrible disappointment. Looks epic. Is not. Very simple. Very random. Very bland. Overly long for what it is.

Very enjoyable game that's been well improved by the turn order bidding. Light rules but plenty of interesting decisions to make. The cube tower is a great improvement over dice. Timing, keeping an eye on what's coming out of the tower and what hasn't is a major part of the game. Different styles of play seem to work. Overall it's just good fun and probably the only war-game my wife enjoys playing.

An interesting game which occupies a niche as a combat-centred Euro which isn't just about area control. Players need to develop regions, hold onto them and maintain the welfare of these regions. Some combat is eventually necessary either to expand your options or keep opponents in check.

There are plenty of random elements to the game beyond the cube tower – there's turn order, the events, the sequence of actions, winter revolts and so on. While these elements aren't entirely unpredictable, there aren't many opportunities to react to them either. And so the game is packed with making contingency plans should the random elements not go your way. That's not really an issue on its own, but the game takes at least two hours to complete. It feels a bit too long for a game where luck plays an important role.

This is not Risk!!! Even though the game looks like Risk this is a very strategic game and the Dice tower can sure add some truly memorable moments as the cubes go missing or reappear at exactly the wrong/right moment.  A joy to play with the max players and the order selection leaves you on the edge of your seat so down time seems minimal.
-----------------------------------------------------------Jan 2017 - This game has grown in my estimation.  Never had a bad time playing this game.  The battle cries when dropping troops into the tower and the depth of this game really liven a game night crowd.

This rating will rise.  First play of this went over like a lead ballon.  I loved it - my family did not.  I appreciate the simplicity of the rules and yet the tough decisons you have to make.  To me, that's the mark of a brilliant and refined game.  It is like Tikal, in that you want to do more than you can accomplish on your turn.  You try to maximize what you can do, but you can never execute on everything you want to.  The simplicity of choosing one, and only one, county per action is simple, brilliant, and leads to many dilemnas and interesting decisions.  My youngest liked it, executed a strategy, and did well.  My wifes brain probably hurt trying to choose which action for each county when she really wanted to use one county for multiple actions, and my oldest had a hard time putting a plan together (as she said the cube tower hates her).  Needs more plays.

I give this 1 point more than Shogun because of the more balanced map.
This game really feels like advanced Risk. It's well designed and offer a good time. It is still a little tedious to plan everything at the beginning of every turn with so many things to track. Feels really like each new turn is the beginning of a new game where you have to check back for everything.

This dicetower... it's so great. 
Maybe the best way to solve a combat - if it does not have to be fully deterministic.

Actually I like the map even (which is despised by most). It shows Brandenburg. How couldn't I. Besides that it has cool mechanisms (similar to Kemet and AGoT) in terms of action selection. 

The rioting peasants - when starving - feel very thematic.
Good game.

Good theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Game features a good amount of planning and conflict.  Hidden order track, farmer revolts, turn order bidding and the bonus abilities are interesting mechanics.  The dice tower is unique.  Very good euro wargame.  The components are excellent - mounted board, wood cubes, thick cardboard chits, cloth bag & small somewhat durable cards.  Artwork is average.  Unfortunately the rulebook is not well written and unclear on a few aspects.  Game length is about 2 hours and feels right.

Looks like a area control type game but it´s not. It´s a majority game, but combat will happen, a lot.

Comes with a dice tower for cubes (soldiers) that solves all combats, if you lose, don´t worry, that means your soldiers are inside the tower, and sooner or later they will show up givin´you a great comeback!

Did I mention it´s designed by my favourite creator, Dirk Henn?

Shogun with a slightly less appealing theme but a slightly better map.

A beautifully crafted area control game (it's not a wargame!). It usually clocks in around 2 and a half hours and seems to be just a little longer than Shogun; I'm not sure why.

I love the tower mechanism to resolve wars which essentially is like using a nearly perfectly balanced set of dice.

It is dangerous to be in first place at the end of year one as that player almost always gets wiped out. Beyond that frustrating wrinkle, it's a great game.

Unsurprisingly, the game does also suffer from the AT requirement of having the players balance it; if a player is doing badly, he can be eliminated by another player.

Update: I'm slightly less impressed with the game the more I play it as I'm tiring of the dudes on a map type of game.

Rating down from an 8.1 to a 7.4.

There's nothing else quite like Wallenstein.  The programming board provokes dense decisions, but nearly everything elses adds fizz.  There's a mix of known and random in everything else, including turn order, seasonal events, and the cube tower WITH MEMORY.  It's a long game though.

What a fantastic, fun game. I love all its Euro thinkiness and the struggle on the map for territory. I love everything you have to balance when deciding where to place your cards during the planning phase. I love the way combat is resolved. The cube tower is a thing of genius, and it's just fun and fulfilling to drop those cubes in the tower.

This one gets high praises for a Euro combat game. It goes up there with Kemet as one of my favorite dudes/cubes-on-a-map game.

Shogun/Wallenstein is a flawless piece of game design.  Every time I play it I find myself wanting to set it up and play again.  It's a game I'd like to play several times in a month at some point.  If you have 4/5 players it's fantastic and the battle tower is a great, fresh alternative to some D6 rolls.

If you prefer Japanese theme get Shogun, otherwise the 2nd Ed. Wallenstein is better value as it comes with the expansion.  Shogun's expansion is overpriced and sold separately.

The cube tower in Wallenstein is a rather brilliant combat randomizer. It seems simple, throw in the engaged armies and whoever makes it out of the tower in greater numbers wins. Not only is it unique, but it also adds all sorts of subtle maneuvers, for instance, starting skirmishes you have no chance of winning just to clear out opposing cubes or to seed the tower with your own, for future battles. The clever (and simple) resource management system is also neat, with players trying to predict future moves and outcomes as they must plan their entire turn ahead of time, Robo Rally style.

Such an elegant wargame. The planning phase is perfect, and is one of the best mechanics in any game I have played. The tower (used to resolve wars in the game) is simple and effective. And exciting! I had the first version of Wallenstein, but sold it to buy Shogun. But that game wasn't as good as Wallenstein, probably because I was so used to the german map and names. Now that I finally have the new Wallenstein in english with all the expansions this is a sure 10. Awesome game. Buy it.

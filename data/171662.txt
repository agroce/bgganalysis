Appealing and svelte, Neanderthal presents well for its tiny footprint. The components - from the cards, to the brain maps, and even the tokens - are functional and sturdy. The interfacing of the regions in play is immersive; a surprising achievement considering your tribe is just cubes and their worlds is just a few cards. 

Eklund has used dice and decks exceptionally. Probabilities allow players to move between risk, expected return and safe returns given their context. The way small decks of cards create the shifting climate and availability of daughters is purposeful without needing to be clever. Overall, these mechanisms create a different world to explore each game without changing the nature of the game at all. 

The dynamics of the gameplay are fluidly drawn around the interplay between mating strategies. Although their ultimate distinction is the slightly different ways they score points, throughout the game, the influence your sexuality has on how you grow your tribe or gain access to daughters/language creates shifting incentives and often sharp shifts in ascendancy. 

Solo game - 7; 2-player - 8; 3-player - 9.

3 games with neanderthalensis vs. sapiens and no tribal switch in sight. The multi-step precondition structure coupled with the usual devastating event cards (elder die-off) means you won't get anything done within the 10 or 11 turns the game gives you. It might work with a longer setting (15 turns?). Greenland works much better in that regard and I think I'll stick with that in the future.
Had no problem with the rules.
The 7 rating here is more for the Phil Eklund experience of exploring the theory halo, than the actual gameplay.

Hugely respect the integration of theme in this, but it's such a random luckfest. I understand it works within the theme, but this is the first time I might agree that accurate simulation over gameplay may not be ideal.

Edit: A year later, I've come to respect this and other Eklund experience games more. You just have to take it for what it is.

This is a fun, educational, and imagination-inspiring game. I have mostly played solo so far and it instantly became a favorite. It does take some effort to get all the rules right but it's a fun learning experience as you do. It always draws me deep into the theme. 

The graphic design and components are excellent, and the way this fits into such a small, neat box makes it a top pick for a game to take on trips/vacations.

RATING: 6
The rulebook is a total mess. It took me 3 runthroughs to make everything clear. 30 euros is also too much for such a small game. 
I felt the game is too prone on random factors for it's own good. Some hunt rolls are too critical, also some die-off rolls for the elders can do some serious damage. 
Glaciation can make the environment very hostile or very friendly for no particular reason!
On the plus side it really feels like you are in charge of a tribe of primitive men. Thematically everything is very sound. 

summary:A good simulation but not a good game.

Cousin to Greenland, it shares many of the same mechanics of play as Greenland.  However, I am liking this one a bit more (because it is newer?) because the initial setup is more varied (choice of starting sexuality for each starting species, which already have subtle, distinct advantages) and the process of evolving your knowledge so that you can begin to specialize and even go tribal offers additional decision points over Greenland's basic "survive the brutal environment better than your opponents" theme.

Decent game, seems like a streamlined Pax Porfiriana with the Tableau building... better conflict rules.

The only issue for me is that while I'm not a giant fan of tableau building, Pax has a more interesting theme wrapped around it for me, so although the rules of Pax are more wonky, it's a bit more fun to me. Neanderthal is an objectively better and easier to understand game.

RATING: 8
A game building on the foundations of Greenland, with a really interesting new take on closed 'resource' management system.

I'm trying to sort out in my mind whether I think this is a slightly better game than Greenland because I had already got much of the ruleset in my head before learning the new parts. However, I do. I think it is the better game, but I wouldn't suggest you get this over the other.

One of the base currencies in the game is your 'vocabulary'. You start with 5 in three different kinds - technical, social, and nature. You don't gain any, and you don't lose any during the game. This is your capacity to do interesting things. You need to allocate it to train, develop tools or to cultivate. You allocate it to make bids on cards. If you've stretched yourself thin, and your reserve of vocab is smaller than the number of hunters you have, you are vulnerable to chaos and to a schism in your group. You free up 'words' through experience and through simply thinking about it - "Neolexia" - if your species is advanced enough to start to do that.

I really like this game. The struggle to manage your language discs, build your population, bid on the daughters you needs, advance your brain portals, and survive events makes for a tense and fun game experience. I have had games where the cards have made it easy to build my population and the right Daughter cards have come up. I have also had tough games where nothing is easy and I am lucky to add one population each turn. A very fun game system that I have enjoyed solo also. I enjoy it more than Greenland.

Playtester for this game…. Very engrossing, much more flexible than Greenland ("Sister" game), with a lot more variability (due to daughter cards, implementation of many different new mechanics [sexuality, predator/scavengers, vocalization, mental portals {Origins!}, etc, etc.])

Pretty stoked to see the final thing in person.
I'm almost a little bummed that there will not be a "SMG Classic" print run on the first ed. (Like Greenland, First Ed., Bios, etc.) with the same iconography/graphics/graphic design, etc. I think the new art will be beautiful, but some of the playfulness of the pared down design is a little unserious for the game matter. We'll see.

Typical Eklund game. Strong connection to the theme with a lot of science in it. Not sure, but it might be broken in 2 player competitive: If you are the first one to get a war chief, you might be able to hunt your opponent down very easily. In a 3 player game, this tactic is not such a thread although it still seems pretty effective.
Great game for three players!

An update on how I feel about the different sexualities in the game, which I was initially skeptical of: these make more sense than I initially thought. Our ancestors were promiscuous through this time frame and well through it, probably until settled societies were common and agriculture started to become a thing (maybe 12-10kya?). There is obviously dispute about this; some scientists think monogamy was part of the "cultural package" that turned anatomically modern humans into behaviorally modern humans about 40kya (I don't think there is any argument we were promiscuous before that). We probably can't really know and human experience was probably just as varied then as it is now - possibly even moreso. But I've read the arguments, and I don't find the position that pair-bonding evolved this early - or even evolved at all, as anything more than a social construct that was required after societies became rich enough to generate personal wealth for most of its members - at all persuasive. But that's the joy of games like this - the science is far from certain, and it's hard to imagine that at least a few tribes didn't experiment with pair-bonding or harems (the latter being by far the least plausible of the three to my mind) in this time frame. It's not *likely* (again IMO) that this is how things played out, but it's not impossible, and the game is a fun way to experiment. Clearly humans' approach to sexuality has changed massively in the lifetime of our species, for cultural rather than evolutionary reasons. And the game is about that cultural package.

---

Greenland hooked me instantly; Neanderthal took a little bit longer. The setting for Greenland is easy to explain - natives and Vikings struggling for survival as the climate deteriorates - while Neanderthal is a little more thematically nebulous, and it's not quite as clear what you're supposed to be doing. After the first play though I had enough of the structure to really understand and enjoy the game (both Greenland and Neanderthal really reward playing a second game in a timely manner), and now think it's as good as its predecessor.

In Neanderthal, it's much less about raw survival as in Greenland - although survival is definitely an issue! - and more about navigating cultural development. You need to get some daughters, develop your culture (by developing the brain map), get your alphas, promote elders, domesticate an animal - there are actually a ton of priorities, all of them really pressing, and you can only do a fraction of them.

Like Greenland, there is quite a lot of luck in Neanderthal: climate change and death coming from the event deck and the vagaries of the hunt. I'm certainly not a fan of arbitrary randomness in games, but for me Neanderthal and Greenland are both chaotic in a the sort of way I love: they make you adapt to constantly changing circumstances, they give you a strong narrative drive, and they make you set yourself up for success without giving you any guarantees; you can only do your best. You face a great deal of uncertainty, but your choices also matter a lot. You have to take a lot of risks. The great thing about both games is that they really aren't that long to play (~2hr). The proviso is that with the rules explanation and struggling with the freedom the games give you, the first time through can run long (3hr). That's not super-great, both are much more fun at 2hr than 3hr, but it's definitely worth pressing on. The 2nd game plays a lot faster. I have some concern that Neanderthal might run a bit long - the initial play is certainly longer than Greenland, as you have more choices - but it's pretty clear just a little experience helps a lot.

with a few house rules to mitigate player elimination and luck this game would be awesome. I have only played it twice and both times a player made all the right decisions and weighed up the odds but came unstuck because of bad dice rolls which spoilt their enjoyment of an otherwise really well designed game. There needs to be some type of "gaining workers" to modify dice like in castles of burgundy or you "lose a turn" to regain your starting number of hunters otherwise if you are a bad dice roller this game will just hurt you for 3 hours plus

This is such a tough game for me to rank. I love the multi-use cards, tableau building, and push your luck dice rolling. However, there are so many fiddly rules surrounding those core mechanics that it takes away from the actual enjoyable part of the game for me and makes the game longer than it needs to be. If it was just a bit more streamlined I would totally be into this between the theme and mechanics but as it is I'd rather play something else.

I didn't know it at the time, but this is the game I wanted Greenland to be.  Here is Origins: the Card Game.  

While the game is sleeker in just about every respect, it somehow finds a way to make a larger number of interesting arguments.  I suspect the rating will go up as we get comfortable with the various ins-and-outs of the rules.

Update:  After six plays, I'm giving this one a bump.

Update: 14 plays in this one settles at a well-deserved 8.7.  The game is good, damn good with surprising balance and interesting points of tension.  At high skill levels, Greenland may be the better game, but Neanderthal remains perhaps the more accessible Eklund title yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Standard Eklund quality, both in terms of game and simulatory value, but also in terms of rules roughness. :) 

Compared to Greenland, I found it a bit more forgiving and a bit less polished. Needs a bit of tuning to make domestication and inventions more prevalent. No doubt a 2nd edition will fix these issues. Also, again compared to Greenland, it is a bit more abstracted (vocabulary etc), and a bit less tense.

Still, a great game that will stay in the collection.

I think it's too early to rate this (though that won't stop me giving it a provisional rating). Something didn't feel right when I played it. The end game was anticlimactic as we found ourselves unable to do anything due to an impenetrable walk of ice. We think this was down to some poor luck on our part which left us with no warm events. Nevertheless, I need to be convinced that this is a fun game.

I don´t remember having contact with a game so good and so bad at the same time!...

I mean, there are so many and so good ideias in this game that gives you the will to try it and to play it over and over again: The development of a human species, the decisions about their mating system, the decisions about the hunters, the development of elders, the daughter´s maturation to achieve vocabulary through the development of the species brain, resulting in the upgrade of a people to a tribal organization, etc.
However, all this stuff makes this little game so heavy as most hard eurogames and the worst part is the nightmare to learn its rules or (even harder) to explain them!
Besides, the sale price of the game is anomaly high for its contents.

Big game in a small box.  Takes a bit to learn the flow of the game - best to start right in. I don't think it's giving anything away to say I try to grow my group and then leverage scale to score points. Felt like more of a themed experience than an opportunity to focus on optimising strategic choices - though there certainly are choices to be made. I suspect my scores were more the result of how the games played vs doing anything in a particularly clever way. Spent more time appreciating the play itself vs working towards an outcome. Love the art, and the iconography does a good job of making the game more accessible.

I find myself conflicted between liking the rich use of theme, and disliking how much the die rolls seem to determine everything.

Eklund is a mad man. There is so much here and so many thematic details that intrigue me and compel me to want to try it again. Is hard to make a cogent analysis of it after one play so I can't say much more at this time.

Update, two plays:
Having trouble seeing how to make promiscuous work against non-promiscuous. Promiscuous is ready hamstrung by little vocabulary in the early game and we haven't quite figured out how to mitigate that and formulate a successful path out.

Update after 3rd play:
So it seems like the pathway to success for promiscuous is rather nihilistic: burn it all down. I'm not sure I like this because 1) it means promiscuous is played a very specific way, 2) it forces everyone else to work to counter it. BUT, the game is still evolving. A lot of how each game goes will be determined by the biome cards that come out each game. Promiscuous can work if a lot of gathering is available. If not then they may be S.O.L.

I really wanted to like this since the theme is extremely interesting. Unfortunately there is no game here. The random events can be so devastating that one or two of them in a row can wipe out 95% (or more) of your civilization and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. You could even get effectively eliminated from the game in the first or second round without having done anything. Any strategic or tactical decisions are therefore pointless (My gaming partners constantly asked me if anyone has actually playtested this). On top of all this the rulebook is abysmal. In hindsight, the game is actually not that complicated and with a decent rulebook could be learned in 45min or so, but as it is it took me hours of frustration to learn how this works. 
Conclusion: Totally random, would rather play Monopoly.

RATING: 5
Thematically rich game of survival for three types of proto-humans.  The game itself extracts quite a toll due to hunter and elder attrition as disasters occur and the prey fights back via dice rolls.  Cultural development occurs through recruitments of daughters, marriages and hunt results.  It's more open than Greenland as the daughters are not assigned to a specific side but instead acquired in game flow.

Not as good of a game as Greenland, although I find the brain development theme very interesting. On the whole I like this system the least of the SMG systems. Greenland allows for more interesting decisions and a bit more asymmetry but ultimately timing with events that you have no control over as well as inability to mitigate dice rolling results makes this game less enjoyable than Greenland despite the interesting theme. I hope SMG puts this system behind and pursues more games in the Bios series and Pax series.

Very good simulation game by Phil Eklund.
There is alot more randomness in Neanderthal than Pax Porfiriana (the only other Phil Eklund game I've played) but I love it nonetheless!
There's alot of interesting choices to make during the game but your strategy can fall appart because of random events or dice roll.
If you want a game with complete control, this is not for you but I don't mind the radomness because it matches with the theme.  You can't predict if your hunts will be succesful or not.
The replayability is pretty high because of the available biomes and daughters that are different every time.

A very rewarding (and unforgiving) gaming experience. The subject matter is handled incredibly well; this is both a scientific exposé and a mechanically impressive game at the same time.

It's certainly not the lightest game on the market, despite its deceptively modest footprint, and some players may experience a bit of a learning curve initially. But the core mechanics aren't really that complicated once you manage to penetrate all the terminology.

Plenty of depth and a real challenge. Can't wait for more plays, both solo and with others (my wife loved it as well, which is a huge plus).

RATING: 7
Con dos partidas, de momento es un juego recomendable.

Es un juego que te pide conocerlo, hay que conocer los mecanismos y el funcionamiento del juego, hay dos partes diferenciadas, el juego es narrativo y va generando una historia, pero por otro lado las mecánicas a veces se hacen inservibles al ir avanzando en post de la narratividad. 

Personalmente es un juego que me ha encantado por ser tan temático e interesante, el desarrollo y evolución de lo que somos siempre me ha parecido interesante y aquí está bien llevado en contraposición a juegos anteriores del mismo tema de Eklund como Origins, que es más una simulación didáctica que juego.

Como juego no es tan bueno, hay mecánicas que no están bien adaptadas durante el desarrollo y no es ni elegante ni armonioso.

Como conclusión el juego funciona y si te gusta el tema es muy recomendable, pero si eres un jugador puro y el tema te da igual, no parece que vaya a ser un juego con demasiado recorrido.

Eklund's prequel to Greenland (which feels like a sequel) builds upon in a lot of creative ways to offer a greater variety of venues to work towards "becoming human." The elements are still just as brutal (particularly when you consider big hunts now mean that predators might chase after your prey when you take it down!), but the additional options give you a bit more leverage to survive, that is, should your people become tribal (as you can't both *ook ook* your way through negotiation!). In turn, this may result in more conflict in the multiplayer game (which I'm excited to try out). 

Yet again, well researched package that is chock-full of narrative and game.

Haven't played yet, but seems like a card like The Paintress should not be auctioned, but instead simply placed out and each player can decide to work on it or not, and if they work on it, the amount they want to invest in it. That would seem to fit theme better. Another thought: since players represent an entire species, it doesn't seem right to resolve hunting via dice. There are so many hunting attempts going on that they should be accomplishing a statistical amount based on the amount they invest in it.

This game has a bunch of things I don't normally like in a game: Lots of luck, lots of unavoidable misfortune, and the capability to be left in the dust.

However, in this game, it just plain WORKS. I think the fact it's a quasi-attempt at simulation helps, as playing the different hominid species brings the whole volatility into focus. Fun, fun game. I'd rate it higher if it weren't for the fact that any particular play of the game can go sour very quickly for only one player while two other players get to have a great time. It's never a good time when you're the one on the bad end of the spectrum!

A brutal struggle for fulfilment of the specie's strategy without any moral restrictions set in the archaic times. Delicious signs of the future humanity greatness are visible and shine through the game as your verbal abilities increase. From the darkness of the instinct behaviour where rapes, racism and extreme selfishness rules, your specie learns how to create culture via vocabulary acquisition and visibly transforms into a caring, trading, family-oriented, toll-inventing and nature-understanding beginnings of the modern man as we know them.
A great mystery of the origins of man with a hidden ensoulment moment somewhere between Mamooth fights, flint mining and raising gifted daughters and brave sons. To be continued with the Christian baptism in the sequel game called Greenland.

RATING: 6.5
First impressions, based on a playtest game played 21/4 2015:

Mechanically *very* similar to Greenland. Where the rules differ, the changes are mostly to the better in Neanderthal. However, the game runs long (our 15 round game took about 3.5 hours, which is much too long), and mechanically, the game is not really interesting enough for that kind of play time (unlike, say, Origins or High Frontier).

I particularly like the concept of the "closed economy" of language discs, and how you unlock elders/daughters/your tribal side, etc. A bit of an Origins feel, there...

Karim's artwork and layout looks professional, but also (I am sorry to say) a little bland - it reminds me of a well-done Powerpoint presentation on a boring subject. Looking back at Phil's earlier artwork for the game, I think I actually prefer that... At least the biome cards are much more colorful and evocative in the original versions.


Neanderthal in most ways feels like an improvement on Greenland. It adds the potential for (much) longer games though, but apart from that, most of the mechanical changes seem to be improvements. Luckily, I should add; while I like Greenland well enough, it's one of the mechanically least interesting games I've seen from SMG in quite a few years, so it's only really satisfactory as a shorter game.

That being said, it's yet another "interact-with-cards-in-two-rows-in-a-display" game - like Pax Porf, Greenland (and to a degree Bios Megafauna) before it - and of course we have Pax Pamir and Greenland 2nd ed. coming out this year as well. I sincerely hope that making these card games that fit a certain mold is NOT Phil's vision for the future of SMG. To me, it's the big games, like High Frontier and Origins, that really stand out among Phil's designs.

RATING: 6
Neanderthal covers the greatest cultural revolution in history. Like all of Eklund's designs this one is exploding in subject specific details from hunting/gathering, animal domestication and migration, climate shifts, raids, colonization, technological advances, births, elders, sexual practice, the establishment of language, and ultimately the creation of cultural norms. It has elements of both Origins brain maps, MPI concepts, and emphasis on language as well as mechanical structure of Greenland although the strategic options are more robust than the latter this time around. And all of this in a 90min, tiny boxed, well-researched package. 

WARNING: Like all Eklund's, please do not approach this like a standard, abstract euro exercise, placing cubes and rolling dice for points. Such play sucks all the life and narrative out of the game and you will be disappointed.

RATING: 6
Lots of thought went into this design. Evolutionary concepts are crammed into every inch of the cards. The gameplay oozes theme. At least as long as you accept rolling dice and having two thirds of your tribe eliminated in a single roll as thematic. Don't question yourself at this time why dice rolling is considered as thematic but resource conversion is the mark of a dry euro. Less theme-prone gamers could see the heavy reliance on luck of the dice with only a limited auction part as mediocre mechanisms. Covering a simple set collection of three differently colored discs as 'developing the brain map' doesn't look too thematic either.

Long games with high randomness and few potential for clever moves due to simple mechanisms are not my type of game. Pax Porfiriana is the superior Eklund choice with its focus on pitting players against each other instead of facing a randomly punishing game system individually with player interaction just putting the dot on the i of an adverse environment.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

The vocabulary model is nicely balanced between several goals and influences. Invest vocabulary to gain cultural benefits, keep vocabulary to prevent chaos in large hunter groups, increase hunter group size to help regain invested vocabulary, maintain specific types of vocabulary to keep certain benefits. It's interweaving is much more interesting than a bunch of seperate chrome rules. Would probably rate higher if it felt less abstract and more grounded in scientific fact. Of course the topic precludes much of that, as there isn't much known about the specifics of that time period.

Like some of Eklund's more modern card games, the pacing seems a little too quick for my taste, resulting in a game with relatively few turns and with each turn representing big events that can change the dynamic of the game. It's a bit like a highlight reel of the turning points instead of an ebb and flow.

Neanderthal is a brilliant conception. The amount of immersion i feel while playing this game is indescribable. when I play i'm amongst my tribe members as we struggle to meet the needs for survival. The mechanics are luck driven, but can be mitigated along the way. Ultimately, a large sum of luck lead species along their evolutionary path anyways. The one negative i have is for the convoluted rule book. It took me at least 3 reads through its 20-something pages to full understand, but once you get through that garbage rulebook, you will have a yourself a cave man ruckus. The game is just down right fun. Neanderthal has me dreaming about the free life i could have had if civilization didn't enslave me.

It took me about 5 hours to read and understand the rules, with the game in front of me.

The rulebook is one of the worst: few games draw so much criticism for their rulebook. Some crucial points are not mentioned immediately, but only as restrictions mentioned later in passing (e.g., restriction on *mature* daughters not in E3 but in G1). Some concepts are left vague: "elder" sometimes means "mature elder", sometimes "immature or mature elder"…

The rules are somewhat half-baked, with early updates to the first edition rules, with inconsistencies that I could spot by just reading the rules (without even having to play the game),… While I appreciate the existence of living rules and Phil's presence on the forums on BoardGameGeek, I spent too much time trying to clear things up; so did many other people, I am sure. The situation is similar to Robinson Crusoe's and Ignacy's approximate and evolving rules.

RATING: 7
I always approach Phil Eklund games with some trepidation. Will there be some content thrown in with the game that I'm going to have a problem with, like being lectured about how colonialism was great for all and unfettered capitalism is the best thing ever, even if there's no reason to include it? Will I once again start to regret the purchases I've made?

And there's always the fact that Sierra Madre rulebooks are often...whimsical...in their presentation, and usually out of date from the moment they arrive, thanks to the concept of "living" (aka, unfinished) rules. His games tend to be puzzle boxes with a number of interlocking parts that are difficult to explain and learn, yet work fairly well once you get going.

One game of his I played in the past was Origins, in which the first part of the game is evolutionary biology and then you get dumped into a fairly rote eurogame. This game, Neanderthal, expands on that first, more interesting part more. 

The thing people will hate the most here is the amount of dice rolling involved, with very little means to mitigate it. In fact, there's a whole lot of randomness; if you are someone who likes setting up a plan and just seeing how it plays out, this is not the game for you. Personally, I like a game that includes dice and doesn't try to feel ashamed for doing so.

As with other Eklund games, I liked it a bunch, but it's going to be a bear to get to the table regularly, since learning and retaining the rules (which, since I started this sentence, have changed three more times) is so tough. Hopefully I'll get to see more of it.

ADDENDUM: Somehow I forgot a very important fact. There's a second "half" to this game. After you get to a certain point, you advance to a "Tribal" race. However, doing so is so difficult that even if you make it there, chances are there isn't much game left to do much. In our game two players hit Tribal with only 2 rounds left to go. We're hoping that further play will help players know how to make decisions that will unlock the Tribal game quicker.

Neanderthal is a good paradox.  It is a game for adults that stimulates your imagination just like when you were a kid.  The game oozes theme, in fact it is properly described as a simulation game.  The rules make sense -- they allow you to dive deep into the story that is being narrated by the game while also allowing you to compete.  It is a deep game, with many layers.  It is also the exception to my usual preferences -- I usually prefer no luck/low luck games but in this case, where the game is telling me a story of survival in the face of uncertainty, I welcome the roll of the die, it is part of the storytelling experience.
As I was playing it, I remember thinking to myself:  this is a game for adults!  Then I realized that I was playing with drawn cards and little wooden cubes and yet I could conjure this whole world in my mind, just like when I was a child.  Any game that keeps you engaged for several hours in the unfolding story, that when the final round arrives the players are somewhat disappointed the end is here, and that stimulates discussion after play, is a great game in my book.  Bravo Mr. Eklund!
Make no mistakes -- this is a HEAVY game.  The rules must be studied and taught, the options are many, it is complex and deep even though the basic mechanics are simple (make choice, roll dice).  Also, this is a game where the flavor is essential part of the game -- you want to call things as they are, you don't want to strip away the flavor of the game, in fact all the little details, footnotes, descriptions on the cards, are integral part of the whole experience.  I still remember that nasty, nasty European Donkey that I chased for centuries, always coming up empty handed and losing hunters in the process, or the time I sent my best hunters to court the Neanderthal women and they all died.  This is storytelling in a game.

Very thematic game!

Sometimes the little games are the best ones.

We had a blast playing this at the Sierra Madre Booth. Charlie - a good friend of Phil Eklund (the Designer) - introduced us to the game. There is so much going on in this little gem: Build up your hunter tribe, marry daughters, gain knowledge to grow your brain and get new action possibilities, promote hunter to elders, survive the harsh stone age nature, deal with ice sheets, chaos, events, attack other tribes, gain culture by marrying daughters of other tribes ... 

... this little package is uberfull of good stories. I happily bought one of the few last copies of the Game. Imagine playing "The Croods" (if you know the animated movie) and learn by the way a lot about the genesis of man.

And the best: You can combine that with Greenland (another title from Eklund) and combine your games - so that vou can take your newly created Tribe in Neanderthal and play and survive with it in Greenland.

Survival game, which at first looks like a dicefest and slowly change to very deep going strategy game, which is very well balanced. Another bonus is that the game is actually based on scientific theory about our evolution and all parts of this game have a place in it. The theme is also working very well, and when you play, you can  feel how hard it could be to live in that age.

This is an interesting game, although it can be harsh, and conflict is unavoidable.

I enjoyed this - it is a fun & very interesting theme and the ups and downs are dramatic. I've played a couple of times solo and once with three players. In the three player game, one player was shut out of doing anything for half the game due to unlucky dice rolls. Which was a drag for him and for the rest of us. I will play multiplayer again, but wonder if this might be better solo to get around being hosed by luck. That said, it is a unique and interesting enough game, that living through that kind of hardship might be fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on my first solo game but I see a lot that I like here.  Took the brain map from Origins, simplified it, and tied it into Greenland mechanics, so what could go wrong?  Of course, as in all his games fate can screw you, but that adds to the interest.  Looking forward to playing with a couple other players so things like raids on their daughters are more hotly contested, and player order becomes important

Three player even better.  I am impressed how the game flows and the story the game tells.  The auctions more important.  I lost by just 4 points despite not getting to tribal status.  Great game for a small box.

Some interesting ideas, and a cool theme, but ultimately a very arbitrary and needlessly complex experience. I don't mind rolling dice to simulate chance, but not when you have a 1 in 6 chance of succeeding...sometimes less. I admire Eklund's designs, but they're just not that fun for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Phil Eklund designs games that simulate real life, such as Bios Megafauna which simulates dinosaurs and survival, High Frontier for space travel and so forth. His games are more experiential rather than competitive Eurogames, and usually include a high dose of luck. Neanderthal is no different, simulating the rise of three predecessors of humans in the ice age. 

Each race has three different colors of discs to place into their brain, to make them mode advanced so you can put them into tribes. You gather more hunters by trying to take down animals, and you roll dice to see if you are successful or unlucky, where you can lose hunters.  You bid on daughters to give you more special abilities, and your type of sexuality (promisuous and other types) influence your tribes by limiting the number of discs that you have. 

I only played through a few turns, but there was a ton of luck in the event cards and dice rolling. Compared to his other games, the simulation aspect didn't particularly feel thematic. I didn't know this game was supposed to lead to another game, Greenland. It was interesting to see a few turns, and probably seen enough to know that I don't need a full play through, but could see the Eklund complexities and simulation aspects at work here.

Based on one play: This game was really disappointing, everything was based on dice rolls so you try to get some meeples to place on different cards and to tokens for bidding and then most actions cause you to roll dice. Some to determine loses and others for battles. Roll badly and you get punished while if you role the desired outcome you get rewarded. As you lose meeples it gets harder to advance and random events are constantly occurring each turn. We didn't even finish the game as it was much too repetitive and none of us (three were playing) were having fun, and to stop a game mid-play is very uncommon in my group.

This game shares a lot of similarities to Greenland. From the very limited plays of both, I believe I enjoyed Greenland more. I found this one significantly more difficult based on the difficulty of getting a handsize, the bidding of daughters and the alpha male being useless until you unlock enough portals/elders.

I'd like to do a complete Neanderthal/Greenland run, but I feel like I'd had a hard time getting 2 other players to complete it with me.

A lot of chrome on this one and potentially more diversity in your culture based on daughters and starting sexuality.

Neanderthal is the prequel to Eklund's Greenland. It shares a lot of the mechanisms, but on first play appears to be more strategic and more interesting. Essentially, you spend the first half of the game earning the right to do the things that come as starting abilities in Greenland. That did mean that I spent quite a lot of the game doing not much at all, but I think I'd be prepared much better for the next play.

Only played a couple of times, but surprised I'm enjoying it as much as I am. The theme is great, particularly trying to build up your species vocab abilities as you aim to make them tribal. Nice connection between the hunt, the cultural abilities of daughters and elders, and the jump to tribes as you start to communicate with each other beyond grunts and ooks. 

Like all SMG card game titles, not particularly accessible first time around and there's constant rule book referencing, but then it all connects so nicely after a few games. I don't mind bad luck and poor rolls when I player SMG titles - I just like the experience! It is brutal though - expect one of the tribes (in my two multi-player game experience!) to verge on extinction and be out of the running less than a third of the way through the game. Just hope it's not you, because when things are going really well it feels like you're rolling Yahtzees every turn.

Rating will probably change as I get more plays in. Interesting concept but the rules are a bear to read and quickly understand.  The game has the potential for a lot of challenging play on a small box.

 First two plays solo where much too long with most of the time checking and double checking the rules. 
If  things improve with more plays then I expect to rating to go up. ANd if nt then down.

Hard, random, complex and unforgiving game that is very thematic. If you cannot accept that randomness can hit you hard and go into the game with a "Euro mindset", you will not enjoy it. If you see this game rather as an experience and that you try your best how to cope with all the adversities, this is very enjoyable.

Phil's designs are notoriously brutal due to some potentially punishing die rolls, but are thematically and scientifically grounded (at times, with some controversy). Neanderthal is no exception. In this game, you are one of three species of archaic man. Developing vocabulary into your chosen 'man's' brain is the quintessential key to unlocking your tribe's potential. By developing the social, technical, and nature domains of the brain, you gain access to abilities that bolster your survival skills. Your goal is to survive: endure harsh weather, gather and/or hunt sustenance and produce progeny, and ultimately endure to be the most prominent ancestor of today's homo sapiens. 

Each play of this game is so wildly different and engaging, but the luck is certainly wildly swinging. There is some depth here, and some interesting combinations of powers between your chosen prehistoric man's sexual orientation and the daughter's abilities working together. Very neat design, indeed.

Man, this game is so beautiful. Amazing atmosphere, history, clean functional artwork and tight gameplay. I like it more than Greenland so far. There's a lot of gameplay in a small box for sure, with many paths to victory. Oh, and did I memtion that women rule in this game? Those daughters are awesome!!! Only thing is that it's a very tough game to get to the table and it's not something that I want to play all of the time. There's a lot of little rules, iconography, and man, the rulebook is straight up bad. It sucks to always have a feeling that you're playing the game wrong in some sections, and I always feel that way about Phil Eklund games. If the rules were better written and that faciliated the playing of it and made the experience smoother, my rating would be a 9. It really is a phenomenal design and an incredible experience.

So if you love this sort of Eklund game, Neanderthal is the sort of game you'll love. It's got the deep science, the bonkers randomness, the uncompromising vision, etc. etc. You've been here before.

The chassis is very clearly Greenland with the hunting biomes, themselves a pastiche of mechanics from Megafauna. You send out little cube hunters and hope for babies and stuff. A new wrinkle is predators that will snipe your kill if you're not careful.

The tortilla wrapping around this hunt-flavored burrito is the creation of culture and social structure via the opening of mental-linguistic "portals" in the brain and the concomitant specialization of members of your proto-tribe (the ubiquitous "elders"). Sexuality (down, goat!) also plays a part, in that the differences between pair-bonding, harem-holding, and promiscuity affect scoring, marriage, and a raft of protoculture special abilities expressed through "daughter" cards (culture transmission through child-rearing). You acquire daughters by bidding "vocabulary", a variety of colored disks that you then have to work out how to free again for later use. As you can see there are layers upon layers of unusual abstraction here, but I did say it was an Eklund game at the start, right?

Later in the game, assuming you can survive the nasty, brutish, and short events, you can go from "vocal" to "tribal", locking in your culture but unlocking more robust elders and allowing you to domesticate animals and invent tools. We didn't quite make it to that point in our game last night* so I can't comment on it, but it seems similar to the decision to go monotheistic in Greenland.

Speaking of which, I only played Greenland once, so I am not sure I can do a qualitative comparison between it and Neanderthal, but my first impression is that scoring is more moderated in the latter which will make it a better competitive game. But if you're reading this, that might be of secondary importance to the journey.

So, to sum up, I love crazy Eklund games, they are about the experience, this one is no different, you can play in an hour or so but double that if you have to learn from the rules. By all means by solo with one tribe just to figure shit out before you spring this on your rabid colleagues.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the super graphic design work by Karim Chakroun. I would pay double for any Sierra Madre game that uses his talents, but as in all things subjectivity may lead you to a different conclusion.

tl'dr : two thumbs up laden with caveats

(*) One of the common ball-busting events is "chaos", which straight-up kills half your hunters and usually an elder as well. We missed the bit where you're only affected by chaos if you have more hunters than vocabulary disks, which is an easy requirement at the outset. Sigh.

In terms of gameplay, this is a mixed bag. I like the idea of tying auctions with the immaturity of daughters, as well as the ability to choose your mating strategy, which covers your endgame scoring conditions, bonuses and restrictions. But among the other things which rubbed me the wrong way includes the player order conditions changing three times in a single round, as well as the persnickety rules for courtship. I also [i]really[/i] wish there were more ways to mitigate luck here.

The other parts of the game are similarly mixed – the rulebook is detailed although it suffers from the odd vague term and poor organisation. The graphic design, while a little monotonous, greatly improves accessibility. However, what ultimately makes this game (like other Eklund games) is the designer's passion for incorporating the subject matter into the game. Sure, the science behind it is questionable at points, but it is hard not to pause and admire the flavour text and footnotes sprinkled throughout.

An evolution of Greenland with a dash of Origins: How We Became Human tossed in. Quite fascinating... (still a complex design but there's an improved rule book over some of SMG's prior efforts so don't be put off).

The utility of the domain disks is brilliant. The daughters are awesome. The events make perfect sense. The variety of biomes is thoroughly engaging. Emphasis on language is intriguing. 

I've seen some players turned off by randomness and chaos (good for solo play).

Brilliant design from top to bottom.

Phil Eklund, you bizarre, brilliant bastard.  I have no idea how your brain works, but I love it.

I think perhaps only he could make a fun, compelling game about the influence of sexuality and vocabulary on the evolution of mankind from hunter-gatherers on the ice flow to developing the early stages of culture (assuming your tribe survives the elements).  Pretty luck heavy for such a heavy theme, though.  Seems a bit incongruous in that way.

Every bit as good as Greenland. The economy, which revolves around brainpower, vocabulary, and sexuality (wowza!) is somewhat more abstract and a bit trickier to parse, but that's overcome by anyone interested in Phil Eklund's brand of game-via-simulation.

I much prefer this to the first part of Origins where you also build your genotype's brain. Like all Eklund games the simulation aspect sometimes get in the way of the game but that is also what makes them great. Neanderthal is not as harsh and constrictive as Greenland which means the gameplay is more satisfying to me despite the fact that I prefer the setting of Greenland.

My first Phil Eklund game.  His focus on scientific and non military historical themes is right in my sweet spot.  Maybe the heaviest game by box size I know of other than other small box Eklund games).  Lots of dice and luck, but somehow it doesn't bother me at all.  Amazing game.

RATING: 8
Another gem in a little box by Phil Eklund.  As much as this seems familiar having played Greenland it is a very different in its core.  In Greenland you start off fairly strong, and then the environment kicks your butt.  In Neanderthal you start off weak and need to claw your way up in power.  In that struggle you get to decide how your little band of primates are going to evolve and become tribal.

Based on solo play only.  I believe this one benefits more from engaging with multiple players than its predecessor Greenland.  This i because the auction and wife stealing mechanics are much more in need of human interaction to be interesting.

Originally passed over Neanderthal because I had Greenland (1st ed.) and I thought it would be more of the same. No, it's very much it's own game. I enjoy it so much I got a second copy just to keep in the car. (I also go a toy mastodon as a start player marker.)

The rule book is a massive hurdle with this game, and I'll never understand why that has to be so.

It's definitely unforgiving, but I really appreciate Eklund's accurate, historical approach to his games.

This game is best played while in a drug-induced state, assuming you can keep your head. Works well with 2, but a third player adds a lot of intrigue. Neanderthal is effectively a sandbox game, because there's really no clear path to take to victory. All players may lose, though the player least close to losing will win. Really interesting to poke around and see all the possibilities for the history of intelligent life on this Earth.

Phil Eklund took almost all of the mechanics from his previous game, Greenland and ported them over to Neanderthal, improving almost every single one. 

While the structure is the same, the details not only make the two games distinct but also give Neanderthal a bit more decision space. The auction matters quite a bit more than Greenland because it allows you to evolve along a fairly customizable path. That's pretty much off the table in Greenland, where the different tribes have powers pre-assigned to them and instead only receive things like dice-manipulation tools or domesticated animals for easy food, which are useful...but kind of boring in retrospect.

The biomes are a much more dynamic place as well, with the tableau in a constant state of flux. Unlike Greenland, it doesn't just get progressively worse and slow you down. Sometimes the weather actually improves and things can take a turn for the better. The world is still perilous, but not always as hopeless as Greenland can sometimes be. There is some fun stuff added to the biomes to, such as predators that wander in and steal your kill, or berry bushes and fruit trees, that allow your women to gather while the men hunt. In the end, it generates about the same amount of resources from turn to turn as in Greenland, so the dynamic is about the same, but those little additions make Neanderthal feel a little more alive.

One thing that seems like a minor change but ends up having a big effect on play is the new concept of maturing. It usually takes a few turns for new cultural powers and traits to kick in after you buy them, as well as for new village elders to gain their powers. This counters the slightly more forgiving biomes, as you can't immediately reset everything you lose the following turn like you can in Greenland. It's probably a lateral move in regards to total difficulty, but it rewards planning and brings a lot of tension to all of the game's phases.

There's room for both Greenland and Neanderthal on your shelves because they tell very different stories, but if you only have the time or inclination for one...make it Neanderthal.

Prehistoric simulation between three species of early man competing by advancing culture, technology and social development to become the dominant species of modern man. Early survival while developing language to advance through generations. Hunt and gather, domesticating animals, hieroglyphics, develop tribes, extinction, importance of elders, invent fire. It's all here. Big game in a small box. Pair-bonding and promiscuous mating strategies? OK, I've seen everything in a board game. Love the science explanations and how they relate to the game system. Further proof that fun learning through the vehicle of a board game is powerful. I would have paid better attention in Anthro 101 if we played this game as an intro. Brilliant game, I'm a big fan.

Rulebook is typical, the amount of time needed for me to learn and the absorption to distillation (How long it takes me to digest and be able to teach this quickly and well) is somewhat significant.

Wow, this is even better than it's older sibling Greenland. Neanderthal is one hell of a sweet little educational game about a hugely important event in the history of man. Yes, sometimes Phil Eklund's highly thematic games can feel more akin to a simulation than a proper game, but you have to make some seriously hard decisions in Neanderthal, and that puts it firmly in the game camp for me!

I adore this title. I feel a better person for having played it. This is one hell of a fun game.

I love the themes Phil Eklund takes on to make games about, but man he needs to up his rule writing. A few better examples / pictures should have made our first game go much smoother. 

About the game: It is certainly an interesting game. I already played Greenland and it is similar yet different as well, a bit more 'streamlined'. 

What I disliked most is the very very random elder die off. It's maybe 'realistic' but it is really very annoying and incredibly frustrating. Almost to the point were nobody wants to make elders, though you have to if you're tribal. 

The push your luck part of the game is pretty high too but at least you more or less manage it. It's still frustrating if you don't roll 1 or 2's. 

I would have praised and loved the game if it didn't came with all the dice-rolling. There're still decisions to make and strategy to run, so I do still think it's a good game.

Not a game for people that can't handle the constant punishment the game gives you. Though if you're interested in the theme I'ld check it out for sure.

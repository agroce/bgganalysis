What do you get when you take a well-respected card game with a great auction mechanic, and then strip out that auction mechanic?  Modern Art: the card game.  While the title seems absurd and/or like a quick easy way to make a buck off an existing successful franchise, this game actually really hit the spot for me.

I really like Modern Art.  I suck at it, but I really like it.  Unfortunately, my wife does not and neither do one of my main gaming groups.  Also, Modern Art cannot be played two-player.  Now along comes Modern Art: the card game (I still find this title hilarious), and it only costs $12, it's amazingly portable, and it does play 2-player.  It has the Modern Art "theme" (including the same artwork), and it actually plays very similary in terms of feel and strategy despite completely lacking any auctions.  

It's all about timing and set collection, and of course it helps to have the cards with abilities (like draw an extra card, play 2 cards of the same time in a row, add an extra 2 points to the artist, etc.).  I have only played this 2-player so far, but I have to say it's quickly becoming a travel game of choice for me and my wife.  Surprisingly good, simple game.

LIKE: different style of game. light. interesting mechanism.
DISLIKE: graphic design is dated. scoring is fiddly and needs pencil paper.

OVERALL: needs more play and with more players. may be better with more than 2 players. also, someone did analysis of playing styles, the "tortoise" (slow and steady) vs "hare" (save all cards until the end) play styles, seems balanced. could use money chips to make it more involved.

From the Reviews: A card game that plays 2-5 in 30 minutes is good, the theme is "mellow" such that a new person would be interested in playing. People enjoy this game. It was stressed that this is NOT Modern Art, but it is own little game in its own right. This would be a good game to pick up in the Gryphon line.

A game heavily based on Modern Art. It is simplified and faster, have some strategies for sure and have the same feeling of playing Mordern Art. But the bid system in Modern Art put you into another level of control in this game, mitigating the luck very much, thing that cannot be done very well with Masters Gallery. Anyway, a good filler.

A good party game for groups of similar skill and experience. 

The tone down master gallery is much quicker and much more exciting for casual gamers. Seasoned gamers would prefer the original bidding aspect, as it adds to the tension that not all cards that you play belong to your own gallery. 

Both are good games. Worthy of a classic treatment. 

Only game by RK that is worth my gaming time.

DON'T MISTAKE THIS FOR THE VERSION OF MODERN ART THAT YOU REALLY WANT.  I bought a copy of "Modern Art" hoping to get the auction game.  What I got was a fun game that doesn't involve auctions at all.  It's a pretty fun hand management game with some of the same scoring escalation mechanics as Modern Art, but without any bidding whatsoever.

This is actually a pretty good game!  Initially I did not have much expectation, but after learning the rules.  It's such a good game to play at lunch time.  Enough depth, enough trash talk, fun to think and yet, it doesn't take too much attention (which is good for a lunch game).

Thumbs up for this one!

I rate Modern Art a perfect 10 and MA:tCG really suffers by comparison.  Essentially, it extracts the hand management from its parent and tries to make a game of it.  It just about works, although the everybody plays a card power seems a pretty bad idea.  I can't imagine why I'd play this instead of the original or a vast number of better fillers.

Modern Art without the auctions, and I think it worked surprisingly well.  Fits right in the upper end of fillers for my tastes.  As with Modern Art, playing two cards is generally awesome and the more of those you draw the better you'll probably do.  Seemed like there was a better amount of control with 3P.

I was hesitant about this one because I dislike auction games and have avoided Modern Art for that reason.  But, there's no auction here, and it's pretty interesting.  There's a good amount of guesswork, and the scoring is typical Knizia, but the game is quick and tense.

I won my copy from the Spiel.

A very dumbed down version of Modern Art. So dumbed down it's unrecognisable with none of the original's attributes and none of its skill and finesse.

Yet another hastily and ill conceived offering from Mr Knizia who's need to churn out x hundred puddle-shallow luck fuelled games a year is now the absolute priority over producing a considered creation that has any merit. 

He's entitled to make a living, but his games were all 1000% better when he relied on working in a bank to pay the mortgage and gave us games with something to think about.

When I first heard about this game I couldn't help thinking that Modern Art without auctions sounded like a pretty hollow experience to me. And, honestly, in comparison to Modern Art this is a fairly hollow game, but as a light filler game it kind of works. The mechanisms are very simple, and it makes you think on every turn because you want to get in on the most prolific artists without tipping your hand to your opponents. I actually enjoyed playing, which surprised me, and I think I might hang onto the game for now because it can give me a somewhat Modern Art experience in a shorter timeframe. Perhaps the biggest demerit against this game is that they took away the variety of art, and depict the same painting on every single card for a particular artist. This sucks any theme that existed in the original game out, and suddenly I feel like they could have slapped any theme on this mechanism without changing the experience. In fact you could almost play with an ordinary set of playing cards. Regardless it's still a decent card game, which maybe only suffers because it is named after a truly great one.

What do you get if you take the auctions out of Modern Art? Well my first thought was 'no game at all', but once I had played it I realised I was being too harsh. The answer is more like 'a very simple filler'. Way too simple for my tastes, involving some very basic decision making. OK I suppose but it wasn't even the best filler I played that day (not even in the top 3).

My wife read the box and found it interesting so we picked it up.  I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the game.  Modern Art without the bidding.  I really enjoyed the hand management of the game and with the same type of scoring as MA, it made for some tough decisions.  I only played with two and really enjoyed it.  Looking forward to playing this one again.

If I had never played Modern Art I would probably enjoy this more... I really missed the auctions.  This is definitely a more approachable game than Modern Art, but there are plenty of other set collecting card games that I could play too and the auctions are not THAT complicated in Modern Art.

Surprisingly, it's a lot like Modern Art, but plays completely different.  The same feel is there, but it's more of a react to "what's going on" game.  No more worries about people throwing the game due to bad bidding.  It's quick and interesting and worth playing.

Just doesn't hold interest. Modern Art is way better. There are so many decent card games of the same weight I don't see myself ever suggesting this again.

Removes an element from Modern Art that makes it a true "gamers game" in the sense that incorrect bidding can really mess the game up.  This version will be much better suited to casual play at my game nights, as will most of the Gryphon bookshelf series.

Essen 2013.  I love Modern Art, which is one of the best auction games around.  So a MA game without auctions should be awful, yes?  Well, no; actually.  Not as good as the original as it lacks the same intensity but it's a good, light, cardgame which makes for a very decent filler.  Count me pleasantly surprised, though not overwhelmed.  As for presentation, the 'non-modern art' version featuring the Impressionists is by far the more attractive of the two versions.

Playing a couple more times my opinion of this game totally tanked. Still a Knizia, so it works, but it's pretty boring.
---
Definitely not on par with the classic Modern Art, and if you compare the two, Master's Gallery certainly gets the short end of the stick. But as its own game, this is a good and interesting lightweight game that succeeds where Trendy and some of Knizia's other featherweights failed. For me, this is in a good spot - clever, interesting, well-paced with skillfully managed tension, and enough depth to fill the game time - not on par with his bigger games for depth or theme, but also simple and short. Not a classic, but fun, and more than it appears, as is usual for Knizia.

:indigo: A game that I think has gotten some flak for not having much of anything to do with Modern Art: The Regular Game, and unfairly so, in my mind. This is a quick filler game for sure, but a durned clever one. The mechanics of the game cleverly mimic faddish mobs chasing after the new hot thing (thematic!), and there's some room for clever and creative play in here.

For reasons probably related to the fact that I own iOS versions of this and two other short card games by the good Dr. Knizia (Money! and High Society), I tend to lump the three together. They're all good games, all with simple rules and exactly one ingenious mechanic apiece that sets them apart. Take your pick but you won't be disappointed.

RATING: 6
8+ plays face to face (3p, 4p, 5p) -- like it, and a little wary of the luck factor, but still like it. Reminded me a bit of Trendy and Merchant as well as classic Modern Art-with-the-auctions. Bought my own copy. Update: Played iOS version as well... Not sure what is the right rules!! Which is the best way to play? Weird, possibly problem that in analog printed rules, players may run out of cards before 4th, even 3rd round. There's a logic to it, but it seems unKnizia-like to me to have players sitting out some rounds. ...I like it OK (above average, not great excitement). But... what I really like about it (worthy of a higher rating): it seems to have a nice value as tiny-box, cheap, easy-to-play social card game that is popular with different social groups, and has a fresh-feeling twist on mechanisms. Based on one play with 3p, I think it is better with 4p or 5p.

Knizia seems to be on a tear redesigning and repackaging old ideas lately. I'm still waiting for The Lost Cities Dice Game and Ra the Dexterity Game but for the time being we have Modern Art: The Card Game.

The game features the artists of Modern Art with Modern Art style card distribution. It plays almost nothing like MA though, as player turns consist of just playing a card for an artist. Some of the cards allow players to play bonus cards face down, allow everyone to secretly select a bonus card and then simultaneously reveal, and to place a bonus 2 point chip on an artist that sticks with them. Rounds end like MA when the sixth painting is played for an artist and then score 3/2/1 points for 1/2/3 finish, and like MA the score chips accumulate over the course of the game and all pay out if the artist finishes in the top 3 again. Oh yes, and at the end of the round you can also play out a bonus card for each artist that placed, provided you had at least one of them out to begin with. 4 rounds of this and high score wins.

I think the title of this game is actually a bit of a misnomer despite the similarities to the base game in terms of how the round ends and how the scoring system works. The reason I say this is because it isn't an auction game, and the way I would explain MA is "the most pure and delightful auctions only game that I have ever played." Because this isn't an auction game, it has very little of the feel of its namesake for me, with the hand management being the only real remaining glimmer.

I don't mean to come across as overly negative though, this is a fairly charming filler. It's not as deep as true all stars like High Society, but it has some interesting decisions. Granted, the amount of blind card play can be irksome, but in a game of this length it's not a particularly big deal either. Fast players should easily be able to play this in 15 minutes or so.

What happens when you take an amazing auction game and strip out the auctions?  You get a soulless game of trying to outwit your opponent in set collection.

My main issues with this game are that the cards which offer bonus actions are only scattered in the deck, so if you're not lucky enough to draw the right ones at the right time, you'll be out of luck.  And why have all the various pictures from the original game been removed - leaving just 5 paintings?  Variety is the spice of life, I tell you!

Just six cards for each artist display symbols, which, instead of designating a certain type of auction, permit the player to take an additional action. The other cards you simply play one at a time. The game is greatly simplified from the original, and you avoid the valuation issues that had befuddled some players and bogged down play. For now, I think that there are enough strategic options in the new game to overcome a hand of cards that is short on symbols.

Players are speculating on their art collection, trying to acquire the most valuable set by the end of the game.  Simple play a card type game, where players gradually grow an art collection.  A scoring round is triggered when six (or five) cards of an artist hit the table, with the three top artists for the round paying out points.  Repeat for four rounds.  Essentially a blend of two fantastic games - Modern Art (sans auctions) and Trendy (group-think popularity contest), and the combination works very well.  Easier than Modern Art, more thinky than Trendy, and as usual with Knizia.  The Modern Art "problem" of players holding a lot of double cards is here still, but this is a filler, and forgivable.  Great game.

Neat mechanics, though we kept forgetting to count the "extra masterpiece" in scoring.

Also, we had at least one player not in the final round. Is that supposed to happen?

I feel that with more plays, the flow of the game will make more sense.

My initial reaction to this game was that taking the auctions out of Modern Art was just a crazy idea, and MA is renown for being one of the premier pure auction games.  But as I thought about, I realized that what I enjoy about MA is the manipulation of the artist values through the card play.  The auctions were just a way to get to that, and were actually not the most interesting part of the game.  In fact, I wonder if the reason that MA has so many different kinds of auctions is that they are not all that compelling on their own.  

So, after this reflection, I'm thinking I would rather own Master's Gallery than Modern Art for a few reasons:

1) The valuation you need to do to play MA makes the game rather tough for newbies and also rather fragile.  Someone who misvalues a painting or two can easily hand the game to someone else.

2) I really prefer the use of actual classic paintings in MG.  

3) Having the essence of MA in a easy-to-teach filler package means I will get to play it a lot more.

4) Frankly, I have other games that I would rather play than MA when I'm in the mood for an auction.  I think many of Knizia's own games have more interesting auction systems.  I'd rank the auctions in Ra, Medici, Hollywood Blockbuster, Tower of Babel, Taj Mahal, Beowulf: The Legend all above MA for fun factor. 

UPDATE: Sept 2014
FINALLY played the game, and as I suspected, the auctions are the worst thing about Modern Art.  In contrast, Master's Gallery is a wonderful distillation of the best aspects of Modern Art. 

UPDATE: Nov 2016
Yes, this game is clever.  However, I don't find it all that exciting any more.

Interesting and relatively quick game of painting set collection. It is played over four rounds though which values of certain artist's painting changes based on the cards played by players in previous rounds. It offers interesting and not so obvious decision making and it is on just right amount of fun to be considered occasional filler.

One of Dr. Knizia's best designs IMO.  Modern Art is a great game, but he took the jewel of it - the popularity scoring methodology - and applied it to Master's Gallery, re-jigging it as a streamlined hand management game dispensing with all the (4 different types of) auction malarkey.  I like the quick 4 round game length, the irregular hand re-deals (which really makes players choose to either play cards now or save them for later rounds).  Really tough choices, hidden information that always leads to a tense finish, but never overstays its welcome.  The theme is completely pasted-on, but the art and artists selection is excellent (though Vermeer seems the odd man here vs all the impressionists).  Easier to get to the the table than Modern Art, Master's Gallery is a beautifully streamlined 25min game, fun to play, and one which I very much enjoy playing.

I thought the original Modern Art was already a card game?  Well, this version is almost identical to the original, but with the auctions removed.  It works better than I thought it would, and is one of the few games that will probably take half as long as it says on the box to play (about 15-20 minutes).  Without auctions, there is more luck than the original, but there are still a few interesting decisions to make sometimes.

Much better than I expected. It doesn't approach the greatness of Modern Art, but it's much closer to Trendy in weight and style ... and I'd choose this over Trendy every time. There is some dispute over the wording of an important rule. I play that at the end of the round, you may opt to add one additional card of each artist that you've played. I do think that's what Knizia intended, and makes for a better game than the more liberal interpretation.

RATING: 7
Two  plays with two, six plays with three, and two with four. If Trendy and Modern Art got married and had a child, it would look a lot like this game. There's a little more planning ahead in MA:tCG than in Trendy, because you get more cards up front, but the special-icon cards add back some uncertainty. It's important to mention that you're not necessarily going to like MA:tCG just because you like the original Modern Art, though; they're very different games, even if they share a theme and some mechanical ideas. 

The game is pretty entertaining and can even be a bit thinky at times as players adjust to each others' card plays and try to guess who will be a friend to their cause and who will be an enemy. Some of the special cards add even more strategy into the mix, but the bad thing about these cards is that you need to draw your share of them in order to have a shot at winning. If you never get any that let you play two cards in a turn, you're pretty much out of the running.

How "gamerly" the game is going to be depends heavily on how many people are playing; there's a lot more control in the three-player game than in the four-player game. I probably wouldn't bother bringing it out with five. It also works okay with two, though. 

[b]ADDENDUM:[/b] I just tried the iOS version of the game and discovered that I'd missed a rule for those ten plays. Dang!

[b]ADDENDUM 2:[/b] My opinion of the game has gone up since playing lots of games with the correct rule on iOS.

Knizia's designs are not my favorite thing, probably never will be. But this one is solid fun with some actual thematic grounding: are those cards in your hand worth anything? Maybe if you can lure other people into supporting your pet artist without them realizing you have a whole stack of art ready to sell once the price goes up...

And it's genuinely fast.

A quicker, streamlined version of Modern Art, with none of the interesting aspects of its ancestor.

After playing Masters Gallery from Reiner Knizia, I joked with Keith Blume of Gryphon Games that my review would be just one sentence:  "It is Modern Art without the bidding."  Truth-be-told, this is an accurate description, as the game feels very similar to the famous board game, sans the bidding.  One would initially suspect that removing the bidding would strip the game of its primary element and reduce it to a bland shadow of its predecessor.  Surprisingly, that is not the case, as the card game version, while simpler and quicker, is actually quite fun.

Masters Gallery and its twin The Modern Art Card Game plays in a very similar manner as their ancestor, Modern Art.  Of course, the major element missing is the auctions.  Here, players actually play and possibly score the cards they are dealt as opposed to placing them up for auction.  Removing the auction does simplify the game and remove an element that some fans of the original game might find abhorrent.  Fair enough.  However, I would urge folks not to prematurely dismiss this new game, as it is quite fun and some interesting decisions to make.  Yes, it can be frustrating to play your artists in attempts to land them in the top spots, only to have your opponents play different artists and shut you out of the scoring.  I also wish a score pad or chart had been included.  These, however, are not enough to significantly detract from my enjoyment of the game.  It works well as a light game to open or close an evening, or at family gatherings.  Indeed, it may even find wider audience than its predecessor, which was more involved and required more skill to play well.  Masters Gallery is accessible is more easily accessible, and should have broader appeal.  However, as it is in the real art world, I'm certain there will be appreciation for both the masters and the modern artists!

After playing both Masters Gallery and Modern Art (std), I have to say that I sympathize with those who wish the new game could have added more in return for what it took out.

The original Modern Art game seemed to both flow along more quickly and to be more fun and involving than Masters Gallery, IMHO, despite the added effort trying to value and win paintings in auctions to increase net worth.

I like the classic artwork much better than the make-believe modern stuff used in the older version but nevertheless I have to say the old game is definitely better.

The doc never ceases to amaze here, how he can take certain games like this or Medici and spin them off into other excellent games that actually stand on their own is amazing.  

Modern Art is truly a classic and when I heard this is no longer an auction, that seemed disappointing.  

The truth is, while Modern Art is not replacable, this is a great little game that works very well even without an auction.  

Pretty much ALL the same elements are here except the auction. You have a hand of cards, as do others, and you still need to speculate on what to play, how and when, so you collect sets in front of you just by playing cards.  Instead of different auctions he gave some cards some different special powers to juice them up, so there is a bit of card draw luck here.  

I played this with 2 and it worked very well and was over in 10 - 15 minutes, so a great filler. There could be a problem with 2 where the 5 card max does not get filled, not sure and there must be a workaround (ie if all cards get spent, take 3 extra cards than normal next round) 

It should play well 2 - 4 from what I see though I only played 2 so far.  Good filler with good meat to time ratio, interested to see how it plays with 3 and 4 players

This game has a fatal flaw that ruins even the appearance of fairness. The powers of a few cards allows one player to play an additional card. If one player gets none of these cards they are guaranteed to fall behind the other players since there is almost no way to catch up. This takes a random element (the cards) and exacerbates the randomness effects.

Takes the artwork and scoring from Modern Art (in itself a card game...is this one really Modern Art the other card game?), but uses set collection rather than auctions as its core mechanism.

I found the rounds ending really quickly in this one in my only play, with players only getting 3-4 cards down each round.The pressure didn't seem to be so much on preserving your good cards for the right moment (as per the parent game), more just getting some cards down by the end of the round.

Knizia game in which players put down works of art until one reaches five, then scoring tokens are added, points totalled, works removed and move on to the next round. After four, the game is over. Winner is the most total. Some works have added powers which is nice because there's little variety to the cards afterwards -- and once you pick the strategy to win, you just look out for them.

Instead of bidding for works in auctions players draw and play them directly. The principle of participating and at the same time determining the scoring exhibitions works again. A major drawback is the lack of an element mitigating the luck of the card draws which was done by the auctions in Modern Art. If, in the card game, an opponent gets twice as much cards allowing to play additional cards, there's not much to compensate for this. Other than that it's a decent filler.

For comments on game play, see Modern Art: the Card Game.

The components, again, are just as flimsy.  Chinese produced box, low-quality cards.  I give the game one point higher than MA:tCG because it has different paintings on each artist's cards rather than the same painting, which I thought was really stupid.  There's something to be said for the silliness of the original artists, but I think that Masters Gallery will be a better game to use to introduce non-gamers as the artists are a pretty good hook.

RATING: 6
Of course there is a relationship to Modern Art in the scoring system, but I see this more closely related to Trendy, in which groupthink is very important, forcing you to work together with the other players somewhat, but still needing to set yourself apart with the right artist to get the lead.  

My main gripe with the game is in the production quality.  The card stock is very thin and doesn't feel durable at all.  And it is ridiculous that there is only a single image used for each artist.  For this reason alone I would probably prefer to play Masters Gallery in the future.

I originally bought Duckomenta Art and gave it as a gift.   We've now played it a few times, and I have been thoroughly entertained each play.  The gift was well received, and I would enjoy playing it more, so I ordered a copy for my own collection.

Since its arrival, it has been played numerous times, and two friends have purchased copies for their own collections.

This is tough... Generally, this is a nicely-stripped version of Modern Art with just set collection and a similar scoring method.  Unfortunately, the addition of symbols on some cards that give additional benefits make play too unbalanced based on whether or not you get those special cards.  Still, though, for a game that plays in 10-15 minutes, it's still pretty good.  Overall, I'd give it a thumbs up.

The real art in the Masters Gallery version also makes it MUCH nicer to look at while playing.

Masters Gallery is a smart bidding game that lets you outwit your silly friends with better, more prominent art collections than they have. Even with a few strange rulebook issues and some less fun randomness at higher player counts, Masters Gallery brings risk and mystery to the table.

Pretty good distillation of original game to essential parts. Speeds up gameplay quite a bit but does miss the auction component, which was one of the charms of Modern Art. A little cheap that the art for each artist is the same on each card. A pretty "meh" product.

This is a good card game that doesn't get enough credit.  It is not overly complicated or deep but is very enjoyable. It has very simple game play with a little more complicated Knizia scoring system. This makes it pretty accessible to newer gamers since it's easy to help them see what will score points.

Very little in common with its predecessor though.

This is an absolutely paradigmatic light Knizia game; redolent with the aroma of European culture, and plenty mechanically deep and idiosyncratic enough to engage the intelligence of anyone who's wary of war and rummy clones. Gameplay doesn't feel very much like you're participating in the art market, so the usual charge of "too abstract" does apply here, although I think this would have been aided if a bit more effort had been expended in the rulebook developing the game's theme.

A game based on the Modern Art board game.  You are dealt cards in 5 suits that represent paintings.  You play cards until one color has 6 face up amongst all players.  Some cards have special abilities where you may have face down cards that score.  The most cards of certain color gets 3 points, 2nd get 2 and 3rd gets 1 point.  You then score points based on number of cards played multiplied by the score of each color. 

It is a simple game and really captures the feel of Modern Art and addresses the issue of one player overpaying for another players painting.

I WANT THE MASTER'S GALLERY VERSION.

This is similar to Modern Art (Knizia's classic auction game, heretofore referred to as MA Auction) without the auction. This version of the game (released as Modern Art - The Card Game, heretofore referred to as MA Card) was released using the same artists from MA Auction). Then there was a re-theme of MA Card (called Master's Gallery) where they decided to drop the identical artists from MA Auction (probably b/c they were worried that people would confuse the new MA Card with the classic MA Auction) and re-themed it using classic (and very beautiful) pieces of art.

See Ender's Game review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/404682

While I very much enjoy MA Auction, I think that MA Card (or more specifically Master's Gallery) has enough of a different game play to make it worth owning (even though I have MA Auction). Additionally, the beauty of the classic artists make the game feel very educational (in a positive way). And this too adds to the reasons for wanting it (even though we already have MA Auction). MA Card (or Master's Gallery) also offers 2 player playability (since there is no auction taking place).

We tried this using regular Modern Art cards, so it's probably not quite balanced properly, but it still gave me a feel for how this is supposed to go. I must say I was shocked at how well it worked. It felt like luck drove a lot of the play, but no more so than any quick card game (I'm looking at you, Parade.). There seems to be room for some decent tactics, so the game could evolve as we learn the system a little better. Very interesting.

Not the auction board game version I wanted.

RATING: 7.5
A crunchy filler card game that is considerably reliant on planning your moves (you only get a limited number of cards over the game). The strategic aspect shines with a lower player count, since rounds tend to be over in the blink of an eye with the full complement. I like it, a light card game for some - and excercise in set-collecting strategy for others.

This game was a real winner!  I think a lot of people are confusing it with the old version of the game, which had an auction mechanic; but this newer version is a fast-paced matching game, with a lot more strategy than you'd expect.  Really fun and fast!

I liked this, but I'm not sure I was playing 100% correctly, and it definitely feels like a game that works better with more players rather than less. Aside from the attractive art, this is a pretty simple set collection game that ramps up pretty quickly. I only wish that the game included a way to keep score.

UPDATE: Much better with more players...7->8. Fantastic filler.

The five artists from the original game are represented by cards now. On their turn, a player plays an artist card out of their hand. Some cards ahve special abilities, such as playing another face up card, another face down card, make everyone play a face up card, draw a card, or add a value of 2 to an artist. Round ends when there are 6 face up cards of an artist. The first place artist gets a '3' token, the second place artist gets a '2' token and the third place artist gets a '1' token. Players with these cards in their display score the points. Play over 4 rounds. The artists with tokens only score in the current round if they finish in the top 3 of the round. 

It's a quick 30 minute game. Good game to close a session. There is a lot of luck on your cards, and what other people do. I have played twice with 5 players, and it seemed beyond analysis for me. Perhaps with less players you can form a plan.

Similar to Modern Art in many ways, except that it has no auctions and less overall strategy.  The thing that makes Modern Art the better game isn't so much the auctions (though they can be interesting...but long), but the choice of giving up cards rather then juts simply laying down cards to advance a certain artist.  Somehow I wish there were a better mechanic in laying down cards in this one than simply...laying down cards.  Maybe drawing a second card from the deck after once around would make it less easy to promote the artists you have most of.

Definitely lacking something. A very quick game that is at the same time prone to some appalling Analysis Paralysis was never going to shape up well. Too easy to play collaboratively, an abhorrent suggestion to the devotees of Modern Art, and worryingly dependent on drawing the cards with the symbols. The lack of cash flow has removed everything that was good about the original.

I turned my copy into Modern Art with the assistance of some poker chips and it is all the better for it.

A game where your result seems to be frustratingly outside your control, be it at the hands of luck or of other players. The fun part of the original was the auctions, and that's been stripped. What's left is a game of continual king-making. The power of the doublers remains; and remains a problem. Who gets the most of these can dictate the leader set which people will tend to follow, or finish off sets, controlling the points allocation. Too many first-up issues for me to want to spend further time to see if I'm wrong.

Classy Subtle Card Game. 3 rounds of hand management and commodity speculation of Master Artists and their works.  Worth playing to the end. Bonus that it features classic works of art. This is similar to the game Modern Art but without the auctions. Plays also the same as it's sister the Modern Art Card Game. 

For a Knizia game, this has good feel to it. I like this game better than Modern Art.

One of my favorite card fillers.  It keeps the scoring system of the original Modern Art but ditches the auctions.  Hence the game becomes one of hand management and timing.  You must decide which round is best to use the special ability cards and you must keep an eye as to which artists have the potential to score big in the final rounds.  Some people believe the game was stripped of its soul when the auctions were removed, but this version has much less of the "poor play by one hands the game to a certain player" syndrome.

Played the Modern Art: The Card Game version.  Although it does not have the fabulous bidding part of regular Modern Art, this is a lot of fun too.  It plays quickly and is easy to learn.  I was disappointed that there is only one work pictured for each artist (it is repeated on all of that artist's cards).  A game about art should really have more art.

MA without auctions sounds like you've nothing left, but of course it's about what you put out as well as how and what it sells for.
It's not as good as its parent but it's easier and if you've a player that can't put sensible values on things this gets them around that, and it plays quicker.
But I do miss dreaming up pretentious names for tat and auctioning it: a great shame the cards aren't different bits of, errr, "art".

RATING: 10
Marvelous game design by Knizia. Simple and clever mechanism for driving up the value of the painting. Simple and clever push-your-luck mechanism for ending the round. Mixing in face-down cards and simultaneous reveal cards for uncertainty. Quick set up. Quick game play.

I love this one. You need to do math to compute the score, and sometimes with many players a round can end quickly not giving the last player many opportunities to play scoring artwork, but I am amazed how difficult it is to win consistently at this game. Perfect balance between chaos and control.

Amazingly, given my love of auctions, I like this game more than the original (Modern Art). Getting enough cards that allow you to play more than one card on your turn is a pretty much required if you want to win. But after half a dozen games I have yet to see anyone get too horrible a draw.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yeah, it may look like Modern Art minus auctions but this version feels like Trendy with superpowers which doesn't seem to benefit mankind. The first play with 3 showed the devastating effect a player with too much power can have on accruing huge bounds in scoring, whilst stamping out hope which no canny player can recover from. Befitting their artistic themes, Masters Gallery is a quiet, thoughtful approach whereas Trendy, though shallow and quick has always been a fun outing. Difficult to say whether less or more than 3 will effectively address the superpower issue, though the game may stay alittle longer in the collection for educational purposes. 

Update: I think 4 may be the sweet spot in regards to a balance of control and chaos, though I think the power icons may still be an issue. So the game is interesting in the latter aspect as to how  play well with the hand dealt so rating up a point. However, I can't warm to the game because of the fractured scoring (tokens fragments it further) whereas compared to Trendy where you have a comparative 'feel' as to how you are doing. Now starting to think 2 player may be best.

When I heard Knizia was coming out with Modern Art without the auctions I thought it sounded preposterous, but Masters Gallery is actually a good filler. It's not in the same league as the original game though, not just because you don't have to value the paintings but also because you don't have any control over who gets them. This means you can't change other players' incentives to your advantage, which is the life and soul of Modern Art.

This is another clever game by Reiner Knizia. You try to increase the value of the cards and only if other player follow to join ship you might succeed. So this is a game where you have to spot opportunities.

Okay, now that I've played Modern Art, I figured out what's wrong with this game. There's not as much incentive to win the early auctions since the points are much higher in the later rounds. At least in Modern Art, you need the income to bid in the later rounds.

Rating is the same as Modern Art since this plays so quick.

don't confuse "modern art the card game" with "modern art" which happens to be a card game.  "modern art" is a great auction game".  "modern art CG" is a similar concept without any auctions.  Without the auctions, there is a bit more luck, but still some interesting strategy.

update: the luck of drawing special powers is pretty significant.  The remaining good parts of the game are all captured (better) by the original modern art game, so I see no reason to ever play the newer version.

Played a few times.  The simple rules belie the depth of this game.  I only ever played with 5 players, so the rounds were short, and there's certainly room for frustration when you don't even get to play in a round (I feel the dynamics would change significantly with fewer people).  The "double play" cards can really skew the game if one player has enough of them.  The challenge comes in the balance of future potential value versus real value now.  You want to get maximum points from your cards, but you don't want to lose out by not being able to play them in the end.

Meglepetés volt a Modern Art kártyaváltozata. Kicsit a Botswana jutott róla eszembe, de persze más a játék. Lapokat játszunk ki a kezünkből öt színben, ha valamiből kijön a hatodik, akkor vége a fordulónak. A legtöbb szín 3, a második 2, a harmadik 1 pontot ér kijátszott laponként. 4 fordulós játékban ezek a pontok mindig hozzáadódnak az előzőekhez így egy-egy szín egyre értékesebb lesz. Az egyszerűséget az egyes lapokon található bónusz lépések adják. Plusz kártya kijátszás, laphúzás, stb. Nagyon jó volt 3-an és 5-en is. Egyszerű, mégis van min gondolkodni. Talán nem túl nehéz a jó stratégia megtalálása, illetve a szerencsén múlik elég sok, de alapvetően nagyon jó kis átvezető játék. Erős hatos.

More of a cousin to Modern Art.  You're still trying to inflate the prices of certain paintings over four rounds that end similar to the original, but here it's more of an exercise in timing your sales correctly.  Still, it's a fast-paced, interesting economic game.  I guess you can say the same thing about Modern Art, so maybe it's not as dissimilar as what meets the eye.

It's also a brilliant design - only Knizia could take a bidding game and re-design it and remove all of the auctions.

I'm not exactly sure who thought it would be a good idea to take the auctions out of Modern Art, but it doesn't work at all for me.  I'm not all that big a fan of Modern Art anyway, but it can be fun in its own way, but this game takes what fun and enjoyment I got out of Modern Art and kind of turns it into a semi sort of trick taking game with weird scoring based on Modern Art.

Not good.

Az volt az érzésünk, hogy valamilyen szabályt rosszul játszhatunk, mert nálunk minden forduló nagyon hamar véget ért. Valaki beindított egy színt, és a többek ugyanabból tettek ki lapokat, ennek eredményeknén hamar összejött a 6 lap egy színből. Azt hiányoltuk, hogy semmi nincs, ami arra sarkall, hogy lassabban gyűljön ki a 6 lap egy színből. De mondom, lehet, hogy rossz szabályokkal játszottuk.

A másik dolog, ami felmerült, hogy hogyan lehet egy teljesen az aukciókról szóló játékot úgy kártyásítani, hogy a szerző kiveszi belőle az aukciókat. Elég bizarul hangzik, de itt éppen ezt történt. Egyetlen egy aukció sincs a játékban, annak ellenére, hogy elvile a Modern Art kártya változatáról van szó.

Played once with 5 players. This was an extremely quick playing game, but I don't have a feel for any sort of strategy yet.

You'd think that ripping the auctions out of Modern Art would leave you with a shell of the original, but instead you get a completely different experience.  Yes, Master's Gallery has less player interaction, but the game requires less concentration and is easygoing.   Modern Art is always lively, tense, and can play as a substantial main course. Master's Gallery is lighter, simpler for beginners, and plays as decent filler.  They both work.

Not nearly as good as Modern Art, but since Modern Art is one of my favorite games, it's still decent. 

It is somewhat faster than Modern Art, which is a minor benefit (the original game is not that long), and is less fragile, which is more significant; in the original game a poor player can swing the game to another player. It is much harder to do that here. That doesn't make it a better game overall, but it might make it a better game to play with random people whose ability to think on their feet is not known.

I like that the game takes the basic system of Modern Art and simplifies it to a streamlined, faster game that manages to maintain the same feel of its pappy.  That being said, the game is so simplified that people who are big fans of Modern Art probably won't be too impressed with it.  For those people who like the payout system, and want that same experience in a shorter playtime, then the card game will probably scratch that itch.  Since it still requires the same hand management skills to do well in the game, it really maintains the feel of the original game.

Modern Art without the auctions - therefore quicker. As a filler it is excellent. If get to play more often the rating may go up.

Nothing wrong with this one, but nothing worth talking about either.

After the first round of my first game i thought this was an extremely silly and meaningless game.
At the end of my second game I think this is an incredibly smart game, so simple yet so interesting.
Yes, there can be rounds that end immediately but it means you are not planning ahead for your next rounds!
It's like Modern Art but without what makes Modern Art a great game... and yet, this is also a great game!
Oh, So far i just played it in two and i think it will be much much better in 4 or 5!

I have the duck edition and i must add that the art is truly funny!

The artwork was poor in the version I played, but the game has potential. Hard to judge how much depth there is in the game since it felt like the game played itself in some ways (the cards delt was really important). Will consider raising the rating after a couple of plays.

A little too pared down - I was wanting something like what I've read of Modern Art itself and this is far simpler and pared down. Great art on the cards and interesting scoring, but not a keeper for me.

Quick and addictive. Simplified version of Modern Art without the auctioning.

The only nod this earns from me is the one I get when I'm falling asleep.  Stick with the original, Barbie - even if math [i]is[/i] hard.

After 1 play. Slightly different from the original. Different symbols on the cards. Not quite as good.

But Modern Art is already a card game.

I actually like this one better than full Modern Art! MUCH faster to play and not as much pressure for calculating the value of everything.

I won a copy of this from a game theory class i took for my job. It's been sitting unopened for that amount of time, and now finally, I realize it's a real game. It was hard to find here on BGG, as when doing a search comes up at Modern Art. two different games if you ask me, (and my wife who has played Modern Art).

Very disappointing compared to the old 'green box' Modern Art - no bidding/auction mechanic, which was our favorite part of the out of print game!

RATING: 6
This takes a relatively light game, and makes it even lighter by removing the bidding aspect. 

I can appreciate a streamlined game, as I think Coloretto is a better game than Zooloretto as the interesting aspect of the game is retained and the fat is cut away (or rather ft was added to make Zooloretto), but in this case as interesting part was removed to make a more simplistic and less interesting game.

Modern Art is overrated.  This version seems more fun, with the shorter game time making a bad draw more bearable.

RATING: 6.5
I didn't really care for the auction part of Modern Art, so to me this is the preferred version if I were to play it.  I no longer need to guess at the value of the art, instead, I formulate my strategy base on the cards in my hands and those in people's tableau.  The only thing I don't like is that the game is skewed in favor of those who end up with most of the special cards, especially ones that let you play another piece.  A nice retooled edition.

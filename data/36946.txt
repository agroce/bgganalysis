RATING: 7
This game really suffers from the production quality. Everything is so tiny in order to fit into the small Fantasy Flight game box size. That makes handling the components a real pain. The other reason why this has seen little play after purchase: Several more interesting co-ops have come out since.

Good light fun.  
We got a couple of rules wrong in the first couple of games and it would have been worth someone having learnt the game before our session as reading through the rules put a bit of a downer on the fun.

I was misled by the small box into thinking this was a filler. Whoops. Had I known it was a 1-2 hour game, I would have never agreed to end the game night on this one. Unfortunately, during the enormous downtime I was able to read about it and by that time I didn't want to quit the game and ruin it for other people. I was very thankful when one of our tracks went too high, causing us to fail and mercifully end this stupid game.

Games like this are killing my desire to play coops. The downtime is too long, the game is too long, there aren't many interesting decisions to make to justify two hours of gameplay. Why is the box so small for such a long game? I won't play this again.

A very big game for such a small board.

Easy to learn and play.

Well balanced ,if you have lots of players more things go wrong.

If you have a couple of players ,less things go wrong but you have less gnomes to sort it out.

Fast ,fun a laught to play.

I bought this game because it is playable by one person, and I needed a good distraction for those times when the power goes out and I am by myself. The rules could be presented in a better manner, but the game itself is just fine. Bonus points for coming in a small box that wastes very little space.

WOW! I have never played a Co-Op game so tuff! 
This is not for the faint (from rum) of heart... 
A favorite of Marquis De Sade for sure!

Adjusted rating with more plays, the game dropped from 7.4 due to not scaling well above 2 players (tried it with 4 and 5), the downtime is too much and it just seems to drag, for a co-op game this is just not acceptable and there are better co-ops around. The randomness is also quite unforgiving at times.

RATING: 6
+ Cool theme for a game; You definitely feel the pressure throughout playing.
- The board and pieces are just pitiful.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's way too fiddly for a game of its size.  Add on to that the fact that the components are too small and not that pretty to look at and it was just a chore to get through a game. 
I traded this game for David & Goliath.

Nice little co-op game, with an emphasis on "little". I was impressed by the economy of space used in the packaging and all, but the game was perhaps a bit too small and fiddly when actually played. The game is fun, but if I'm going to play a game where I have to overcome an overload of multiplying problems, I'd prefer to play Pandemic or even Arkham Horror, both of which are obvious precursors to this title. I also wasn't very impressed with the theme (gnomes?) but I must say that the artwork on the cards was very nice, if not perhaps wasted due to the tiny size of the cards. All things considered, I would play this again, but I don't feel the burning need to get my own copy yet.

Juego cooperativo de 2 a 8 jugadores. De pequeño tamaño y componentes muy bonitos. Perfecto para jugadores noveles ya que no tienen que competir entre ellos.
Después de algunas partidas creo que he sentido más tensión con este juego que con algunos de los "juegos para jugones" más duros, pero con jugadores experimentados se hace necesario usar la variante donde un jugador es elegido como traidor en secreto al comienzo de juego y al final gana si el resto de jugadores no consiguen salvarse. Con esta variante los gnomos y el saboteador también pueden atacarse entre ellos.
Por ahora el juego me gusta incluso en modo solitario.

Cooperative game for 2 to 8 players. Small sized and very nice components. Perfect for new players since they don't have to compete against one another.
After some plays I realize I've feel more tension with this one than with a lot of the so called hard "gamer's games", but with experienced players it feels necessary to use the variant where one player is secretly chosen as a traitor from the beginning and he wins if the rest of the players finally are unable to save themselves. With this variant the gnomes and the saboteur can also attack one another.
For now I like this game even in solo-play.

Repetitive and dull, sadly.  Takes FOREVER for what it is -- this is not a "more Ameritrash Pandemic," it's sadly (the gnomes are cute!  there are cards!  it's small!  items are cool!) rather lame.

It's tolerably short with 2p, only playing one gnome each, but it seems to come down to "roll lucky or lose" each time, in a sad way.

Yet, somehow, it's ADDICTIVE.

RATING: 5
Cumbersome rules. I played this as a 2-player game and we forgot that fires affected the oxygen track, so we didn't implement that mechanic correctly. The events seem isolated and random. 

UPDATE: After reading the rules again and then demoing it as a download, I've decided that this isn't for me or my gaming group. Seems like running around, rolling dice, and putting out fires and other "fire" type events. Will be trade piled.

*** Some may say that I don't get value out of my trades, but I don't need to keep any of the traded games and space is an issue. Who wants stuff that you don't want to look at ever again? I just free up some nice shelf space and get to try "new-to-me" games that I'm interested in. For games that I have a passing interest in, math trades are a great way to try new games without having to buy them. ***

RATING: 7
Another good co-op game for 2008. I like that it handles more than 4 players, unlike Pandemic and Ghost Stories, although when you get up around 6 to 8 players the game might drag a bit much for most people's liking. Then again, if you are consuming enough grog you shouldn't be caring how long the game takes! :)  But it is nice that 7 and 8 players is at least an option since I can see this game being a hit at family gatherings and such. 

While many have complained about the small size of the box I haven't found it to be a huge problem and it has the added bonus of making the game cheaper AND saving shelf space on my already packed gaming shelves. We did move the time markers off the board next to the track (but don't bump the board!). I've also started keeping the ghost marker in place as a marker of the original position of the players time marker and then just moving the player marker along the track. Seems like a much more efficient way of doing things that is less prone to errors. 

The gameplay isn't quite as good as Pandemic and Ghost Stories but I like the silly theme and the accompanying crazy situations a bit more. It seems to be a much more brutal game with gnomes dying frequently if there are enough of them on the board so be sure to play with the 'Less Deadly Dying' option.

One of the best themes you can come up with: drunken socialist dwarves on a sinking submarine fighting a kraken.  I had a great time playing with a fun group, and we won in a squeaker, but there was some confusion over the rules and how to treat the rising water levels in the sub that detracted a bit from the flow.  It has potential to improve on a second play.  The mechanic for taking actions/turns is very interesting as you move along the outside track in ways that can have big consequences.

The timer track is neat, and I like the ability to try and ditch all your friends and swim for safety. For the longest time, I was playing this wrong - you don't possibly pass out every round, just when you drink. That makes the game significantly better! Who would of thought that playing by the rules fixes things.

An impressive little package (FFG Silver Line Edition).  A very chaotic cooperative game with a fun theme.

Now, that's chaos.  I love the cooperative mechanic, I love the time element, I love the panic that sets in about a third of the way into the game.

It gets a little redundant after awhile, hence the lowered rating, but still a fun one.

Not all that I had hoped for, but a decent cooperative game nonetheless. There is very little difficulty playing with only three. The rules are horrible and it is very necessary to review the multiple FAQs in order to understand various scenarios correctly. Playing with four gnomes (or possibly more) is definitely the way to go but not with any fewer.

The premise is untouchable...bumbling gnomes piloting a submarine...most likely to oblivion...and probably getting quite drunk in the process. The game has very interesting timing mechanics which represent pushing luck while you're also racing to complete timed objectives that can screw you over. Really interesting Faidutti design, and a lot of fun though I'd rein it in at around four players, we've played with more and it can stretch on a little long (though the scaling of actions still seems fine).

I'm not fond of co-operative games so this could well be losing a point on that issue alone.
I believe it would be easier to play if everything was about 50% larger, as it is all the bits seem too small.
Actual gameplay is a little unclear from an initial reading of the rules, some of which could have been cleared up with minor additions to the cards. The symbol for asphixiation on cards that move that marker for example. (Not my idea, just one I agree with.)

I'll play again, but not before attempting to get other games played instead.

Ötletes kooperatív játék, ahol egy tengeralattjárót kell megmentenünk a pusztulástól (helyesebben kb. 1 órát kell túlélnünk, játékosszámtól függően ez lehet kevesebb is, mint 1 óra). Az idő múlása nagyon jól van megoldva, minden cselekedetünknek percköltsége van, de a percek múlásával arányosan különböző gondok merülnek fel.
Ami nem tetszik, az a rengeteg holtidő, mindig az lép, akinek még a legtöbb ideje van hátra, így lehetséges olyan szituáció, hogy akár mindenki háromszor lép, mire újra sorrakerül valaki. Bizonyos helyzetekben ugyanis muszáj sok időt beáldozni valami sürgős cselekedetre... Másik ami nem szimpi, hogy ki lehet esni egész könnyen, egész korán (pl. ha bennégek valahol). Ami nagyon eredeti ötlet viszont, az az, hogy kooperatív ugyan, de bárki (a megfelelő eszköz birtokában) lehet dezertőr a vége felé, ha úgy látja, hogy a többiek nem menekülnek meg. Ha mégis megmenekülnek, akkor a dezertőr veszít. A mi partinkban a dezertőr nyert.
Még egy megjegyzés: megdöbbentően kicsi a doboz, ehhez képest egész komoly a játék!

The first cooperative game I ever played. Hectic and very fun. 

I love my friends simple explanation of the game:

"You have 2 problems: 1) You're a gnome 2) You're on a gnomish submarine"

Fires, floods, bombs, the Kraken - all of them are out to get you.

This game has a funny theme for sure: who wouldn't like to play an half drunk gnome navigating in a submarine about to be destroyed in every imaginable way?

Red November re-implements the time track of Thebes, coupled with nasty events triggered by the movement of players' markers on the track.
The fun of the theme is definitely there, even if I suspect it would vanish very soon.
The decisions are pretty straightforward, and unlucky die rolls can be devastating. But this is part of the fun of the game...
The coop aspect is ok, and there is even the chance one could leave the others in the submarine if the mission is going south!

In the end, it's a game I would play again if asked (by the right people), but not exactly my cup of tea...

seems I am _really_ not a fan of faidutti. I wasn't sure who made this game, but halfway through the rules I somehow knew it must be his game.

this game is NOT well suited to the tiny box it comes in - the board should be twice as large to be usable. the time track should have clearly shown the star fields, so you don't need to check them underneath other pawns.

the game itself - randomness. quite often you find yourself seeing you'll be doing nothing next 10 minutes, and when you do get to move, there doesn't seem there are any interesting decisions to make. 

push your luck/slightly boring/random game. ghost stories are waaaaay better in my book

Initial Impression: This is a silly, cooperative game that involves alot of chaos and constantly feels as if you're one step away from impending doom. Very thematic. I enjoy the game, as does my son.

10 Plays: I shelved this game for a few years but recently brought it back to the table. I'm definitely appreciating and enjoying the game more now. The game tells an interesting narrative and leaves me feeling that control is just very so out of reach. I'm finding that this game works very well solitaire and is manageable even with 4+ gnomes. So far I've only won once but the victory was sweet. Let's see what the next 10 plays bring.

This game is fun coop and solo. I really enjoy the theme of being frenzied gnomes running around in a submarine trying to survive until help arrives. There are some hilarious moments to be had. I love the way turns are handled. It makes it so easy to play solo and just come back to it as I have time. My only real gripe is that it's a long game and it can feel overly long if players are being super cautions.

I like the theme and mechanic of Red November.  The rules are a bit hard to comprehend though, and in our first play we sort of botched it.  Our next time through it went better although we still had to refer to the rules a lot and the cards have very tiny print!  After a few plays we really got into it and this is now one of my son's favorite games.

The theme of the game sounds like great fun, but game play is repetitive and all variations on the exact same action: use a tile, fix a problem, draw disaster card. Rinse and repeat. All problems solved the same way and decisions are not very deep. Not enough tension to hold the interest of our group of 8 players. Perhaps a traitor is needed?

Amusing disaster management game with some unique mechanics.

Come on, drunk Gnomes trying to survive while their submarine progressively malfunctions more and more.  It isn't long before every room is either flooded or on fire, and the pressure is building and the heat is too much and the missles are about to launch... oh, and the Kraken is coming. Hahhaa... what's not to like?

The mechanics are a bit twisted, though.  Sometimes turn order gets a bit weird.  Often times the person who is the riskiest plays the most, while the Gnomes who take their time to ensure success play the least.  Not too fond of that one.  

It's a fun game, with some issues.

After my first solo play this seems like a decent cooperative game.  I can see it being a bit too long and frustrating with too many players, but with 3 or 4 it seems enjoyable.  Though the game feels a bit too small it seems to fit for the depth of the gameplay.  Still there are those exciting moments where you roll the die and hope for a miracle and then manage it, which makes for a lot of entertainment.

Thanks again to my 2008 Secret Santa!  Don't worry that I no longer own it, it went towards a trade that got me my 1 and only grail game.  You helped with that, so I'm a happy camper.

This gets a three for breaking the laws of physics, warping time and space in order to cram more components into a small box than should humanly be possible.  Great production value for a budget game; what a lesson to other companies on how to keep the price tag low and still deliver a pimped-out gaming experience for its price point.  Fantasy Flight is unquestionably the world leader in bang-for-your-buck components, and they do it here for a bargain price.

Unfortunately the game is tripe.

We stumbled through our first game and it was fun... though we were demolished as we had two gnomes faint with just a 1 level of drunkenness.  It was clumsy and it was fun.

In one game, one gnome died with no time on the clock.  In another game, we fell just shy of deactivating the missiles at the final minute.  We were as close as possible without winning.  I've lost six times now (with 4 players and with 5 players) but had more fun losing than I could have imagined.

Played one blah game that was interrupted halfway through when we were kicked out of our gaming area and had to quit the game.  It was actually looking like a chance for a win, but the game didn't have the same fun going on.  Not sure if it was my lame introduction of the game or just the setting but it wasn't as fun.  Not sure if I'll ever play this one again.

Given away.

I very much enjoyed this. A brutal co-op with a lot of silliness.

However, it had that Galaxy Trucker feel of being heavily out of control, but enjoying the ride.

I love chaotic games and as a matter of fact Red November appeals to my taste: anyhow, it’s way too long for the little game it is.

Were it shorter, I would enjoy it much more: as it is, I can’t but think there are better cooperative games around as far as the play time-good time ratio goes.

It’s a pity, as I wished I would like it more because of its theme alone.

A good co-op game that succeeds in building tension -- and plays up to eight!  Very successful re-use of the Prinz track from Thebes.  Right now this is my favourite co-operative game (though note, I have not tried Pandemic).

Complaints, mostly minor:
* The rulebook lacks a good overview, making it hard to see the big picture through all the rules.  I find it hard to learn the game from the book, and it's difficult to look up important bits of info.
* The item tiles should really be cards.  With tiles, everything is open and there is officially no reason for people to communicate at all.  I think some info must be hidden, like in older co-ops like LotR and SOC, to force table-talk.
* Obviously, the presentation.  I think there'd be a lot more buzz about this game if the presentation was nicer (& bigger).  As it is, I like the small, tightly-packed box, but I would enjoy playing it more in a deluxe format.  Who at Fantasy Flight thought that a tiny board would be suitable for a game that handles up to 8 players?!

This game could have gotten a lot more love from another, hungrier company.

EDIT. The second edition from FFG address the above problems. Well, except the rulebook, it might be improved but it's still far from perfect. But it's FFG, watchagonnado. Everything else is definitely better in the new edition. Except it takes up more shelf space, but hey, this game deserves it.

A cooperative game I would describe more as "clever" than "good"--although it's certainly far from bad. It can potentially drag on (and become increasingly more difficult) the more players are added. That said, I'm still fond of it for the time track, which makes the game not just about "what's the greatest threat we have" but also "how much will we risk for the outcome we need." Plus, drunken gnomes.

I want to love this game more but I think it lacks variation... my guess is a good expansion could make this game awesome; e.g. character abilities you have to choose at the start, a more unpredictable journey to the end (no more "we haven't seen fires yet so we should prepare cause very soon stuff will burn") or side quests you have to prioritize as well... The foundation is there but the game feels... unsatisfying.

One play. Thought I'd like this one as the 'actions as time' mechanism seen in Thebes was one I really enjoyed.

In the continuing quest for a "filler" game to tack on the end of a session, I was attracted to this little guy as much because it handled a wide range of players (2-8) as anything else. Oh, and a passing resemblance to the "Awful Green Things" I had a lot of fun with back in the day...

First impressions and based on anecdotal input I'm not sure it will be a filler after all (def'n = less than one hour to play out), but I hope to get it on the table at some point. It has the usual great FFG production values but is a little overpriced in my opinion (Canadian dollar tanked at the wrong time with FFG raising all their prices). Stay tuned...

Not sure I'd want to play with more than 5, silly game of drunk incompetent gnomes. If the theme of trying to survive in a rapidly failing submarine where you have to quaff vodka before you risk putting out a fire appeals you can't go far wrong.

Co-op, although there is the option to abandon your comrades and make a dash for the surface with the right equipment - suitably harsh, most of the time you're going to fail, but the humour of that is what makes the game.

Not a bad coop game, but falls down vs ghost stories or pandemic.
The game is too long (2h) for a coop and his game weight (annouce a number and roll a die).
Not a lot of descions and the game is driven by the dice rolling and the draw of cards.
The time track is also to fiddly.
In a ccop game every player should have a role or distinguish skills/features. So the others need you. In Red November or Hexer v. Salem the player vary in the items they hold. So this is not enough and luck driven.
And to scale such a game to 8 players is just annoying. This game should`nt be played with more than 4.

Glug, glug, glug....

I feel better after that grog! Now to get into that room on fire and open a hatch!!  

Maybe I can whack Clive the burrow gnome with my crow bar before he can escape.

This game is a clever game with anywhere from 2-8 gnomes battling to keep a submarine afloat until they can be rescued.  There is comedy to it however it isnt as zany as I thought it could be.  I wish there were more rooms and maybe a litte more mayhem that could occur but all in all there are some very nice things to it.

It is small, it is attractive, easy to learn quick to play and amusing.

It lacks some intensity and grit but all in all a nice little cooperative game.

Between this and Pandemic I would choose Pandemic slightly and and I would choose Shadows over Camelot over both of those then.  That being said I can't dislike any and would be happy to play any of the 3.

I like this one. It can play anywhere from 1-8 players, and is small enough to go anywhere. It's cooperative, but keeps things interesting through two outlets: the possibility of abandoning your crewmates to their fate, and sheer blinding amounts of randomness. The "traitor" possibility is well done, keeping everyone working together until late in the game, and allowing a little more player choice than a blind card draw at the beginning of the game. The randomness keeps the game from turning into a game of  solitaire: you can't predict what will be most important at the end of the current turn, much less three turns from now, so it's less like a puzzle and more like risk management. Much more thematic. And did I mention that I love the concept of communist gnomes in a nuclear submarine?

When playing with 2-4 players, I will usually use 2 gnomes apiece. Juggling two characters is easy, and it keeps people in the game in the (likely) event that one of their gnomes dies off. Yes, there's an official non-fatal variant rule, but I guess I just like a crowded submarine. I also play with open hands, just to make things easier.

fun Co-op game.Simple rules with a nice mechanics for time control.
Doing things take a lot of time to complete, and during that time a lot will happen. 
And nothing is good.
A game that really wants to kill you, and has always succeded so far.

Can be good fun in the right group, although IMHO it is too long for what it is.
When in the mood for a "We will all die in this vehicle" kind of game I'd rather play 2 (or even 3) Space Alert missions.
Due to equipment restrictions the decision space and room for planning seems rather narrow. Everyone semms to try something, for which he has an equipment chit.   This might be a newbie mistake, though.

Good, silly fun,. I really enjoy the theme of this game as the gnomes run from room to room trying to stay alive. I also really enjoy the time and turn order mechanism, which means the player further behind always takes the next move. Yes, there's a fair bit of randomness due to the event cards, but that's what makes the game fun in my opinion--trying to manage the chance and randomness. There are times when certain victory is snatched away at the last minute or when you amazingly survive against seemingly impossible odds. This is also any easy game to play solo, which I do with some frequency. Erin enjoyed this play even more than her first (less tired), and we both had a lot of fun. I love this game!

RATING: 5
The problem with this game is that there are much better cooperatives out there. For example Pandemic or Forbidden Island (which I own).

The game is ok, but the time spending mechanic is a little confusing at first. The major problem it has is inconsistent difficulty. The difficulty of each game can vary a lot. There will be some games that cannot be won. Others that are really enjoyable because they are challenging, and most that are just too easy. If the game was shorter maybe it will be less of an issue, because you can just try again, and also the semi-traitor mechanism could occur more often.

With the game as is, it is easy to let most of the chambers with some water, so they cannot be set on fire, and ignore whole right part of the submarine while focusing in the important rooms. Also, it is very difficult to pull the traitor plan, because you need an exact item and perfect timing, and usually the rooms with exterior hatches are left locked.

In summary, it is OK, but suffers greatly from not having a constant difficulty and for being a little long. There are much better options for small cooperative games.

Maybe more focus should be put into the "traitor" aspect of it.

I love the theme. The first edition with the tiny ship is a bit silly and fiddly, but I don't mind and it fits the theme. When playing with many players, we found it to be too difficult. It doesn't scale very well. The difficulty seems to be about right with 4 or 5 players.

Update:

This is a fantastic addition to the co-operative genre.  Faidutti and Gontier have done a knock-out job of this amusing and fun game.  One of the best sessions I have had so far came when my friend and my wife both fled the submarine using the aqua-lung one after the other - leaving me to die in the face of a missile launch!  Although it was a cruel and heartless (and very un-gnomic) thing to do, it was hilarious.  A great little game that packs a punch you might not expect from such a small box.

Red November is ok.  In terms of the co-op genre, which I'm not so hot on, this one has two things going for it.  One, it is unique - the time management system (borrowed from Thebes) allows for planning, and for managing upcoming events (even as those events are unknown).  Very tense and fun.  Also, it is simple.  So, simple and fun, right!?  Well, it is also a little long for what it is.  Simple is good for a short game, or a longer game that is deep, but this is pretty much guided by luck of the draw and roll.  Yes, you can manage things, that's what the whole game (and genre) is about.  But it's a hard sell when you have to commit 60-90 minutes to this bugger, only to possibly be wiped out in the last 5 minutes (which does happen).  Well, maybe these are the same problems I have with co-ops in general, but no matter, this is one of those games I like a lot more in theory than in practice.  Still, if you do like co-ops, this one is cheap, small, and packs a lot of game into its tiny box.  Worth picking up.

RATING: 4
Silly and amusing at first, but boring and repetitive after a while. I wish they had included more varied actions and equipment cards, because each crisis felt almost exactly the same, the only difference being you needed to go to a different room and use a different card to combat it. If the game were 20 minutes shorter, it would be great. As it is, it's only OK.

Lots of little rules to learn.. but once you have it down, it flows pretty nicely.  We won our first game, so I'm not sure how hard the game actually is, but I'd be willing to play it again.  Overall though, I think Pandemic is the superior co-op game, though I would rank Red November higher than Shadows, but lower than LotR.

Two-player game, each controlling two gnomes. First half hour was pretty dull: small, repetitive problems, with no real need for coordination. Then, suddenly, a massive wave of disasters, and planning became more interesting -- and then impossible. Quite fun near the end, when problems flew fast and furious, but very slow at the beginning, when we felt like we were just waiting for the game to really begin. I'm not sure how often we'll play this with the superior Pandemic as an option. UPDATE: The game is [i]so[/i] random with the event tiles that it's basically impossible to plan, so you just spend your time dealing with the most significant current problem. Still, solo play is decent fun, though I don't see a reason to play it multiplayer again.

Fun little co-op game where the theme definitely adds to the experience.  A good balance of decent game play combined with fun thematic elements, such as doing sobriety checks after getting a little liquid courage in order to run into a burning room.  The time mechanism, while no longer innovative, works extremely well here.  While I thought the "decide how much time I will risk spending" seemed clever at first, I felt like the game hinged on these die rolls a little too much.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.

I love the tiny box and the tiny components, so cool.

But the game itself is a combination of random and obvious. Things feel completely outside of your control, there's no predicting what will go wrong, so no planning ahead. And, with no need to play ahead, the best tactical move is fairly obvious.

I wish the game had lived up to the promise of the box and the components.

Initial rating "5" after one play. It's not awful. I like the "timekeeping" aspect... that's a clever way to manage your turn. I just wish there was something other than rolling a 10-sided die for every action check. Compare that D10 roll to something more interesting like the rummy sets of Shadows Over Camelot, the time pressure of Space Alert, or the clever deck manipulation of Pandemic, and a D10 check seems pretty bland.

I also wonder if my lukewarm reaction is due somewhat to subpar production values. It's like they started with the box size, and then tried to figure out how to design the game to fit it. Another play might change my mind, but I suspect other cooperative games have something more unique to offer.

An okay cooperative game.  Certainly not up to the level of Pandemic, which sets the bar in my opinion.  I think Death Angel is also better.  So, this one is probably a pass unless you're really into the genre.  Note that it's possible to backstab your friends in this one, so it's sort of semi-cooperative.

RATING: 7.4
This game suffers from complex rule descriptions that will be off-putting to casual players, and some allusions to violence and death that hurts it seemingly rather innocent gnome theme.

There was not much frantic about the games I have seen to far. In the beginning, there is very little to do, really, so the first player will probably just pick up some items. Even with half the hatches blocked and lots of rooms on fire, there never was any real sense of urgency.

The rules of the revised version did not cover some basic questions that were answered in online FAQ documents regarding the original version, which I think is sloppy. Sloppy and messy manuals seem to be a fundamental problem with FFG.

That said, it is still a nice enough game to add to one's collection of cooperative board games.

The board looks great, but the paper that was pasted to the board falls apart at the fold seam. After only a several uses a nice white line is starting to grow down the middle.

Would like to try a run where nobody can talk. The only time that people can strategize and talk is if their gnomes are in the same room. To make this work the conversing gnomes players would have to go into a secluded area while they talk so that the other players cannot hear.

Decent cooperative game, though I prefer the theme of Pandemic and found that one much easier to catch on to.  First play of Red November was very halting trying to figure out what was going on - 2nd play much better after reading some of the forum posts and player aids posted in the files.  My son really likes cooperative games and enjoys this one for the submarine theme.  I personally don't care for the drunken sailor aspect when playing with kids - we just say the grog is like a caffeine hit.
I suppose a couple more plays will really get us into the flow of the game, though I'm not sure how often this will hit the table.  I fall into the camp of feeling this game would have really benefitted from a larger board - the cramped quarters give me a headache (and though this may seem thematic, it doesn't add to the enjoyment of the game)!

A submarine disaster movie on a board game, it's K-19 the Widowmaker (for anyone whom have seen the movie) except with gnomes and much, much more disaster.

I think the lower ratings are from people whom don't like co-op or tense disaster type games. Personally, my group enjoys the co-op challenge that this game dishes out. The theme is imaginative, as well is the art, and this adds to the game value.

Fantasy Flight hits yet another bulls-eye with this one.

Red November is co-operative game where players take control of a gnome on a submarine. Unfortunately, everything on the sub is breaking, and thus the players must work together to stave off disaster until help arrives. The cooperative element is lots of fun, and the depth and variety is decent. Yet this game can get tedious at times, and it must be played with the right people. But overall, I enjoyed this game. Edit: (2014) Sold this game three years ago because there are better co-ops now. I would recommend pandemic or castle panic over this.

RATING: 7
This game is great fun, primarily for the theme and the frenetic nature of the disasters that occur on the sub. As long as the group can take it lightly and ham up the theme, it's a great time running around trying to fix things, even if sometimes the die absolutely hates you.

My primary objection is I can never seem to remember all the rules, which makes sense because it's published by Fantasy Flight.

Traded away.

An interesting co-operative game in the "impending disaster" genre.  I think it fosters good communication between players and it's certainly challenging.  The luck element (die roll) is a bit too significant and I wish players had more choices.  Still - it's a pretty good game (call it Pandemic Lite.)

Simple little cooperative game. A little bit to simple for me.

As gnomish crewman of a derelict submarine you try to fix one desaster after another.

While this provides some interesting mechanics concerning the way actions are distributed among the players and time is accounted for, the overall gameplay is pretty simplistic - draw card, disaster happens, run there and fix.

For whatever reason this didn't really click with me.  The theme?  Yeah, not the best.  The board?  Crazy small, I can't imagine playing at the upper end of players.  The dice?  A lot of chance when one particular failure might mean elimination or even defeat for all.

Muchas risas en este pequeño cooperativo! El efecto líder está un poco oculto, y es recomendable jugar con la última variante de reglas del autor, la que hace que un 1 (o era un 10?) sea pifia, y por lo tanto, fracaso asegurado. Complica bastante el juego, pero lo hace menos predecible.

Production: Attractive art.  Everything is too tiny, and there is often confusion about the three different danger tracks.

Play: Straight-forward decisions and random consequences.  In a three-player game, I died on my second turn, and it was to the advantage of my fellow players, because for they then faced a third fewer events, and were able to win easily. (2+1+2) (2 plays)

My 11 year old son and 5 year old son both love to play this game with me. We've both won and lost, but everyone loves the cooperative aspect of the game. 

We take this game to Disneyworld, we take it camping, we take it on vacation. The small board and box are a negative to some, but it packs very easily for a great gaming experience on the road.

While I would love a 'big box' FFG experience, the ability to take this game on the road with us has been huge to my family as we can rope my wife and daughter into playing with us when we're away from home. 

Do I like the small size? YES....Would I like a bigger size game? YES...GIVE ME BOTH!!!!!

Best of both worlds here.

Great game, great price, get yourself a copy!!!!!

Something about this game just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe it's that you're rewarded for playing as slowly as possible. Maybe it's that there's very little variety in the event deck, forcing you to solve the same problem over and over. Maybe it's the bizarre way that time progresses during different player actions that makes me feel disoriented. I dunno. It's supposed to be silly and chaotic, and it is, but it doesn't seem to reward players for leaning into that.

Red November is a good game that I'll gladly play... at least every few months. While it is chaotic and fun, it does get old a bit too fast. It's great that the game can be easily taken with you everywhere, but since it doesn't have that much replayability you won't actually be taking it along too often. Red November is not among my favourite coops, but it IS still a good game.

Not entirely sold on Red November yet.  I understand cooperative games need to be challenging but this game is an all-out assault of bad things happening.

This is an abyssmal game. Just wanted it to end as quick as possible. I'd have preferred to be the one drunk and passed out for the entire 60 minutes.

The turn order play mechanic is offensive in an 8 player game -- the game takes FOREVER for each of the eight players to get halfway to the rescued area. 

I was actually praying for a few of the gnomes to just DIE so we could end the game. I applauded a few times when gnomes passed out and had to hold myself back from singing "another one bites the dust". 

There is absolutely NO strategy involved in this game. Purely task delegation. It really just feels like an endless dreaded chore list that someone has given you to complete.

Here's my session report:

Turn 1:
Go to room 'A' roll dice.
 
Turn 2: [25 minutes later]
Go to room 'B' roll dice.

Turn 3: [25 minutes later]
Roll dice , die.

I should start by saying that I do not like cooperative games. I am not a team player and really don't want someone else taking my turns for me.

That being said, I quite enjoy Red November. The theme is engaging and fun, there are plenty of choices to make, it's a good implementation of the time-track mechanism and there is tension in the outcome.

In the right mood and with the right players I rather enjoy this one.

* Fiddly timekeeping/turn order mechanic was slow to resolve and caused problems when people had to guarantee a fix happened without any item to help.
* So many different types of problems required a lot of bits to keep track of while resolving events.
* Soviet gnomish sub theme was a hoot for some, a real turn-off for MANY others
* Too compact; cramped board, small cards, small tiles, and despite the small components, fitting them in the box is a puzzle and a half.
* The "less deadly dying" rule was implemented in every game I played after the first; the player elimination mechanic just doesn't work well in a co-op.
* The game is won mostly on luck; everything has to go as right as can be expected of a game where everything's going wrong. Every die roll, every tile draw and every card turned over has to occur at just the right time for the players to have any prayer of being able to triage effectively.
* The game allows for the backstabbing mechanic of abandoning ship. This usually turns out to be a double-whammy, when the Kraken is looming and the player with the only Aqualung decides to leave his colleagues to their fate.

After 1 play: The turn/time mechanic is really innovative.  The one time I played we lost early on--we suffocated because we could not fix the filtration system (or something like that) in time.  Even after the short play, it already seemed like the play was going to get a bit repetitive and stale.  I could see how this would be fun for awhile but would cause you to lose interest in the long term.  I would like to play again sometime.

We played with 8 players and it took about 2 hours!  Sometimes there would be 15 minutes between my turns where I had nothing to do or think about.  I felt so bad for my wife, who kept looking over at me in exasperation.  I might try this game again with 4 players, but probably not.

The game is overly fiddly (meaning you have to flip over about 3 cards on ever turn, and modify something on the board because of each of those flips), the decisions are somewhat shallow (meaning the odds average out over the long run), and there are too many exceptions to each rule which makes it very cumbersome to learn.

Why play this when Pandemic exists?

This wasn't a bad game, the theme was definitely fun, but I'm not a big co-op fan, and the game seemed somewhat similar to Pandemic.  I wasn't a fan of the tiny board for this game, and I love the graphic design and large board of Pandemic, so in the rare times when I feel like playing a co-op, I couldn't see a reason to choose this game when I have Pandemic.  So I sold it.

Okay, there's not much strategy to it.  Occasionally you have to think for 10-15 seconds to see the best play. Then you make it, then you roll the die. 

This has turned out to be a great party game... you don't *have* to pay attention when it's not your turn, so players can put as much or as little interest into the game as they want.

This game is lighter and smoother playing than I had anticipated, and the latter reason is why I think I like it.  With the recent trends toward brutally complex co-ops (which I do love also, don't get me wrong), I can also appreciate one that is just wacky and easy to play.

I favor the first edition of this with the smaller box for its item tiles rather than cards and the improved portability.

I don't know that I've ever seen another meter management board game, so it has the benefit of novelty.

The random die rolls feel like the most prevalent part of the game. As such, it's difficult to make calculated risks since it all banks on your luck.
The game almost necessarily ends on a boring note.

It's hectic, but not in a good way.

This whole game revolves around trying to answer the question: How much am I willing to risk to accomplish this specific task? Every decision costs time, time you don't have. The more time you spend the better chance of successfully completing the task but in turn that means the more crap hits the fan. So it is a constant weighing of "Just how necessary is it that I complete this task?" Then you set the odds, place your bet and see if you win. Every turn is a little gamble where you get to set the odds. That's what I find so enjoyable about the game. It's funny, it's frustrating, it's exciting and it's random...All together and it's fun.

RATING: 6.25
This is just a straight up fun game. Tons of luck. Miniscule strategy. And yet none of that matters, cause this game rocks. It is quick to play, unbelievably portable and can handle 1 to 8 players. And the best part is that it is dripping with theme. You really feel stressed and frustrated with all that is going wrong with your sub. Finally, when you win (which is rare) it truly feels like you have accomplished something awesome!

[b]6.8.09 Update:[/b] I have to say this game has taken a hit recently, due to the fact that it runs a little long. With seasoned players it can be played relatively fast. But I bought it to draw in new gamers, and with new gamers it takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to win. Obviously shorter if you lose. Rating drops a little.

[b]9.8.12 Update:[/b] Played this a couple of times for the first time in a couple of years. The shine has really rubbed off of this one. The player elimination really sucked and the length was not at all satisfying. My rating has really dropped and I might even add this one to the trade list.

I bumped the rating up by half a point for theme alone, which is perfect for the wacky, frantic mechanics of the game. This is a nice co-op with some clever mechanics and generally good components. I only wish it was all a bit larger. Also, the rules could use clarification in a couple spots (the kraken, for one) but these are minor quibbles that don't do much to detract from a solid coop game experience.  UPDATE: Wow, now it IS larger! I haven't tried the newer, larger version, but I'd probably bump my rating up to a 7.5 given a larger board.

I can't really get into co-op games. This game is good value for money however. Not quite as good as Ghost Stories though, but easier to win. Better with fewer players, since the main obstacle to winning is poor team work. Also it scales poorly in terms of diffculty to number of players. Playing with 2 or 3 is not too hard to win, with 7 its close to impossible

Our first play through we had to quit due to complicated rule book.

Our second play through we were unable to stop the fire outbreak due to lack of grog/fire extinguishers.

Our third play through we were doing great until there was about 20 minutes left, then all hell broke lose.  Fire all over the place ... no grog/fire extinguishers and no path to the Captain's Cabin or the Item Room.

I'm wondering if it's even possible to win at this game.  Seriously.

Strange part?  I kinda like it.  What's that say about me I wonder.

This is an interesting co-op game about drunk Gnomes on a rickety submarine with lots of mishaps going on.  As with most co-ops it's very random and kind of hard.  I like that there are many different variants you can play, such as respawning Gnomes, a hard mode with no Respite in second go through of the event deck, and starting out with so many events already in effect.  This game even has PvP rules in it which I thought was hilarious.  If it looks like the group is going to lose and you have an Aqualung you can abandon ship at a certain point and win if your friends lose, but you lose if your friends win.  Only two things I don't like is that if someone passes out they don't get to take a turn for a while... not ever again if they die while passed out and no respawn rule is being used.  The other nitpick is that this didn't need to be a small box game, I think it's game play justifies  a bigger board.  Maybe not the size of Kingsburg but maybe the larger silver line boxes such as the older Colossal Arena or Maelstrom box.  Decent but better co-ops are out there.

This was a play of the original edition.  I would consider playing the new edition but will not buy it.

I bought this game because I love the size of Fantasy Flights "mini games", sadly Red November ended up being more work then fun. It's VERY random and meant to be be more for laughs then serious strategy, but the play is tedious with the constant drawing of event cards. I guess in the end it felt repetitive and by game end there were no more laughs, just a desire to play something fun.

Light, party-style cooperation luckfest about drunken gnomes trying to save their lifes on the submarine ship ruined by fires, sudden water invasions, engine overpressure, attacking missiles etc. I gave such a low rating because I have played better cooperative games like Ghost Stories and I think that the fun about drunken gnomes is quickly consumed. Too much repetition, not much replayability. Maybe I would have liked this game much more if it had lasted only 20 minutes, 1½ hour with rules explained was too much. Tested 5 player game.

The first game of this was completely chaotic (just like it's supposed to be!) with the added bonus of one potentially hostile player (my wife prefers games with "less rules" ~ I think it would have gone better if one or more of us had played it first), all first-time players, one little kid (who went from the most enthusiastic to the most bored player and vice-versa mid-turn more times than we were in danger), and an interruption mid-game to eat dinner.   The game reconvened with my eldest son and I co-ordinating the efforts of the other players, calling them over one at a time at the small table the game had been moved to...

Still, a lot of fun, and I look forward to a game where the chaos is entirely enclosed in the submarine itself!

(After [b]2+[/b] plays) A compact and humorous light co-op that can accommodate up to eight players.

I hate to give this game such a low rating, but must as I will probably never play it again. Here are my reasons why:

1. Downtime. Perhaps if you played with only 2 people each controlling 2 gnomes, the downtime would be bearable, but we played with 5 people. Often a person would move and then have to wait for the other 4 players to move TWICE before playing again.

2. Overwhelming. Some people don't enjoy games that are built to overwhelm you. I'm the kind of player that doesn't mind a game that is near impossible to win. I think Ghost Stories, for example, is fun. I like Pandemic with 6 pandemic cards in the deck. But my purpose in playing games is to experience the struggle and I enjoy the extreme challenge.

My playing group, on the other hand, was ready to tip the game table about five minutes into this game. As each event card increased the tension, the players began to feel overwhelmed. Some of the cards seemed too harsh. One player even suggested that the next event card ought to read: "Fire and floods rape your mother." When the next card read: "A fire starts. A room is flooded. Everyone discards items down to 4." we all agreed that he had called it.

3. Not fun. Although the ideas that drive the game are interesting in theory (I picked it up after reading the rules and watching a video explanation of the game) they don't actually seem to work in real life. It's just no fun realizing that your gnome is trapped in a room that is on fire and that if he manages to unblock the door, he still doesn't have the fire extinguisher to allow him to survive in the next room.

4. My playing group didn't like it. Sometimes that is enough reason to pack a game away for life. Or at least until enough time passes that my group forgets their awful experience.

I'm giving this a 5 because, as I stated, I like the concept quite a bit. I just can't give it more than a 5 because the game just isn't that fun.

I really like the way this game plays.  It is a co-operative where there can still be 1 winner in the end.  

I do however detest the incredibly small board, cards, pieces.  It makes for difficult play.  We had only four players.  I bought the game so that on game nights, 8 can play.  But the board is so small that it is a complete irritation with more than 4. We have to keep rotating in and out to even see the board; And you can't slide the board up and down the table because the pieces just fall off or dump over. The "look" is nice--just tooooooooo small.

Looking up rules is very heavy, especially when multiple bad events are in the ship.  Through the first 3 games, even though we referred to rules extensively, we discovered we had made some kind of error during the game.

Drunken gnomes face an onslaught of emergencies 20 leagues under the sea.  Fires (!), floods, faulty locks and a Kraken all combine to push a crew of gnomes as far from sobriety as one can get.

I love cooperative games, and I thought I'd really like this one. The time mechanic in Thebes is awesome, and I really liked the sound of the dice rolling / press your luck aspect of the event fixes, but in play I didn't feel like any of it worked. In Thebes there's always the dilemma of how much time to waste on an action so that you don't get too far behind. In Red November I felt like that was all gone. The only way to win the game is to use up the full 60 minutes, so there was never any reason to use less than all, or most, of the necessary time to fix an event. The dice rolling was meaningless since everything became a guaranteed fix, and the time choices just weren't there. Disappointing.

This game just never caught on for me.  It isn't intuative, and therefore was a struggle to get going with.  The play is slow at first, and took too long to get rolling.  The timer mechanism is clever, but akward.  I would be interested in a game that did it better.

The board is just too small, and the player's time markers are best played along side the board.  This sounds okay, but really doesn't work.  One little errant hand movement which moves the board and you are figuring out who was when, because the timers pieces didn't scoot with the board like they would have for any other game.

Finally, the grog element doesn't work for me. I should have figured that out before I obtained the game, but I didn't. It just isn't appropriate for some of my gaming groups, and can't go on Boy Scout trips because of it.  No one has figured out how to work around it yet.

In the end, if you want to play a disaster avoidance game, play Pandemic.  (I haven't tried Space Alert yet.)

Red November is a great party game.  It's nice to bring out when you have a large group of people.  The game supports up to 8 players.  That's about twice the normal amount for a board game.  It's also casual and cooperative meaning that folks who are new to board games, not normally into board games, or don't like competitive activities, can play and enjoy Red November.  The little box contains many pieces and the game's humorous theme and art help to make this a light hearted adventure.
The only downside to this game is that people who crave strategy and are very competitive may find that the game doesn't engage them on a more cerebral level.

Nagyon hangulatos kis coop játék. Teljesen bele sikerült élnem magamat, hogy egy süllyedő tengeralattjárón vagyok és folyamatos problémák jönnek elő. 
Ami kicsit fura volt, hogy úgy tűnt, hogy kifejezetten érdemes az időt siettetni. Lehet, hogy nagyobb játékosszámnál máshogy van, de itt nekem kicsit furán jött ki. Hiányzott a folyamatos krízis is, nem nagyon éreztem veszélyben a küldetést egy pillanatra sem. A vége felé kezdett csak gázos lenni a helyzet, de akkor meg már látszott, hogy nincs idő arra, hogy nagyobb legyen a baj. Lehet, hogy több játékosnál ez is megváltozik, mert jobban pörögnek a lapok. Hármasban pl. a Krakennek semmi szerepe nem volt.
Továbbra is a Pandemic az etalon nálam, aminek a feszültségszintjét valahogy egyik játék se tudja hozni, mechanikában meg annyira hasonló az összes coop, hogy nincs nagyon ingerenciám így másra. Itt hangulat sikerült nagyon jól. Ki kell próbálni többen is.

A bunch of drunken gnomes on an experimental sub that turns out to have one or two warts left in it? Count me in!

There is no shortage of disasters waiting to happen on this doomed boat, and all the gnomes are racing to fix things as quickly as possible. All the gnomes? Normally, yes, but there is a potential traitor element in that gnomes may abandon ship if the situation seems to be getting out of hand.

The rules are simple, and possibly a little too much so. There is only a handful of different events, and many of those are pretty much indistinguishable, so the same things keep happening over and over which means the game might get repetitive very quickly, and I get the feeling that this game is even more reliant on the luck of the draw than your usual cooperative game.

Risk is probably my least favorite game in terms of strategy, but the commanders of 2210 allow for a great deal more thoughtful gameplay. With strategy cards that can create immediate shift in advantage, players may be forced to think twice before trying to sweep across half a continent in a single turn- even when they have the initial pieces to make it feasible. The addition of sea zones can also force players to look beyond the land borders, in hopes of breaking into the back door of a weaker opponent

This game has at its core a very special time mechanic that is fun and elegant that reminds me of the one in the 7th Continent. It is very thematic for a survival game and contributes to making it tense and fun.
I really like survival coop games and this one is fun and silly, but a bit too simple and has no mechanic to leash alpha players. It is quite difficult and you'll need some luck on your side to win.
I like the fact that whoever escapes early in the game will have the opposite fate to the rest of the group, which adds a bit of nice mistrust within the group. But it could have been more central to the overall gameplay.
I did not like the size of the board, cards and components though, which feel unnecessary small. Also, we don't really get to play with the Kraken, so why is it taking half of the board that is already tiny? The kraken doesn't even feel threatening to be honest..
Also, I don't think they thought through the mechanics with the grogue. They tried to add a component of an immediate boost that will hit you back later but it just does not flow nicely. Also, all characters are identical with no special ability. Even their figurine is the same, in different colours, which prevents any kind of empathy or asymmetric gameplay.
Also, the core mechanic is about allocating time to fix something. Once again, placing time at the core of the gameplay. But - in reality, players don't really have the choice. They won't take longer than available - obviously, but it does not feel necessary to push your luck and try to fix it in less time than available. The risk of failure is just too big for the reward. What I am trying to say here is that decision making isn't very exciting in this game. Your next move is quite obvious and the time you should spend to fix it is quite obvious too. If you happen to fail, another player will be able to try after you. And then you hope that you will have enough luck to get to the end alive !

This is a very chaotic, crazy, fun game. I only wish that the box and board were bigger. There's sure to be lots of laughs, with this one.

RATING: 7
Fun co-op, much less thought than Pandemic (which helps give my game collection more balance), amazingly plays and scales well up to 8, but downtime may be a problem with that many (sweet spot maybe at 4-6?)

Edit:
The major problem that I see with this game are the components. It was awesome seeing all the decent-quality components packed into such as small box (some games that come in larger boxes have much, much less components) but this also makes it a bit difficult to play. Taking the components out and setting them up takes a long time, and while playing the game, its easy to knock things around because of their miniature sizes. If the game board was bigger, at least 2 or 3 times, this game would probably be much more enjoyable. (Has seen such few plays as a result of this component issue, as I'm always reluctant to have to "unload" everything).

Although offering some fun moments, the game is mostly in the hands of the best or most experienced player of the group. All the information is available to all players at all times. Thus making the optimal plan is not hard and it falls to the rest of the players to either follow that plan or fail the game.

Players have to be of very similar skill level to have meaningful conversation of the tactics and enjoy the game together.

I don’t mind the theme at all, quite contrary; I think the theme is appealing. There are some other problems though and the main one is the complexity of the rules compared to the game. There are really many rules in comparison to e.g. Pandemic which in this regard can be considered elegant. And still I don’t feel like there is more strategy to it.

It seems to scale very well independent of number of players. The way to handle threat seems to be different depending of number of players, but still the difficulty seems about the same. I have only played once with 7 players.

The game is so much smaller than I anticipated.  Everything in the box is small but functional.

Played a trial solo game to get used to the rules and found the game to be quite absorbing.  Racing around to fix the various disasters occurring around the submarine is quite fun.  Difficult decisions need to be made on how long you want to spent on trying to fix the various problems.  You will need to spend a reasonable amount of time to increase your chance of succeeding but spending more time than needed will reduce the time you have to fix the other problems later on.

Great theme and a very interesting and unique mechanic envolving time. You say how long you'll take to complete tasks and meanwhile other stuff can happen until you get to play again. Everything goes wrong but drinking vodka can help solve any problem, but be careful or your character will faint! The end of the game is fun too, as a player can just leave everyone to die and save himself. If they win though, he is the only loser.

After 1 play: I like it but is a little long for what it is.  The time dynamic is interesting.  We won with two of the gnomes burned to a crisp but the other 4 safe and sound.  A solid coop with a fun theme, but the theme doesn't cover over some of the down-time issues or the issues of randomness.

RATING: 6
A goofy little game of death aboard a gnome submarine. However, it would have worked just as well without the goofiness, and it would have been a tragic battle for survival in the ocean depths. I think I'm glad they lightened the theme (and artwork) a little.

Players work together to keep their submarine running long enough for the rescue teams to arrive. As fires break out and flooding occurs, everyone must run around and try to fix things. The chance of success can be modified by tools and the amount of time spent fixing.

The game may take a little too long for what it is, but you are certainly busy and in danger the whole time, so it doesn't feel that long.

Very light cooperative game that seems to be decided either by luck of the draw or luck of the die. Mildly amusing and quick if you don't play with many players.

I played with four players and can't imagine eight people squeezing themselves around this tiny game. In fact, even the box is too small.

A jewel in the faidutti crown, seems like an experiment on how much you can get in the small silverline box...

Grog-guzzling gnomes on a submarine! What's not to like with a theme like that?
The rulebook could do with an overhaul, the artwork on the tiles isn't very helpful and I'd expect this to grow rather repetitive soon. 

But for now, it accomplishes its goal of being a  fun, fast-moving coop game with plenty of crisis management.

Update: after a few play, the game does become a bit monotonous. Knocked down my score one point.

We're all gonna die! Probably the most fun phrase to repeat over and over in this game. It's a more tongue-in-cheek co-op game compared to Pandemic. Most of my friends are amused by the concept of getting drunk, which isn't so fun when it kills you.

What I like:
The humourous nature of the game. There's an optional rule called "less deadly dying" =) It's a great game to get friends to play due to the level of interaction, though the mechanics can be slightly intimidating at first.

Received as a sweetener in a math trade.  Solid cooperative game that combines a couple neat mechanics with a lot of tried and true stuff.  Tried it with some non-gamers who all enjoyed it.  The bits are good for the price of the game.  Pretty easy but a couple of the interactions were odd.  The theme is great, you really feel the "oh shit" moments.  Its a cool game I would be more likely to pull out with non-gamers than with gamers.  I liked it, more solid silver line size games from FF- easy on the wallet and the shelf.

It takes a little too long and if you play with AP-prone people, it will take even longer and lose its sense of urgency and adventure.

Co-ops don't usually do it for me, so take this with a grain of salt. The main draw here is that it can support a lot of players and has a nice frantic feel to it. It reminded me a lot of Space Alert without the timer, which is an improvement in my estimation. There is a nice feel of teamwork, but there is also that nagging feeling I get with a lot of co-ops that you are pretty much at the mercy of the events and die rolls.

This sub keeps springing leaks, catching on fire, losing oxygen, overheating, getting crushed by descent, starting missile countdowns, and even getting threatened by the Kraken!

Interesting cooperative that is a bit too fluctuating for my tastes. Due to the use of die rolls that don't occur frequently enough for distributions to normalize, the game isn't always as tense as it could be or always providing at least a glimmer of hope (in the crushing way Knizia's Lord of the Rings does so well).

A cooperative game where you and your crew (players) are trying to escape/survive in a Nuclear Sub! You gather items from the storage room to wrench open blocked doors, pump out leaking water, use utilities to fix and repair engines, oxygen room, etc.

Each turn there will be some sort of surprise and the game is great with Vodka! Yes you hear me right! Vodka fixes everything in this game! That's great isn't it?

Survive for 60 minutes and we win! Oh yeah, I forgot to mention there is a Giant octopus and possible nuclear reactor blowing off!

Cute theme and the "minutes to go" mechanics plus last-player-first rule makes for a nice, tense, almost cinematic feeling. On the other hand it seems pretty hard and random.

In the one game we messed pretty much with the rules. E.g. we confused the pressure/heat/oxygen meters very often or forget to adjust them. Also: no water were there's fire already?? Strange rule.

Very funny and challenging co-op game about possibly drunken gnomes on a submarine. All things are in danger to go wrong: fires may break out, there might be leaks in some sections of the ship, there might be problems with oxygen levels, electrics and engine. Occasionally you also have to stop a nuclear weapon of being launched or Kraken eating your crew. It's a constant balancing between being sober and drunk for these gnomes. 
Truly chaotic and hard as a hell, for fun sessions highly recommended. Doesn't however offer too much variation (almost none) to truly compete with the best co-op's I know.

The amount of game this little box holds is good. The value is good. Thematically you're dwarves and you get to go outside and kill the octopus with your harpoon. Sweet.

The game has a cooperative aspect which can get social as you actually cooperate with your fellow dwarves to help run the ship. But then the game kinda drags for me, and there isn't really anything special going on.

It's a good solid game, and that's it.

I was playing GNovember solo and found it to be an interesting game.  Now I need to update my comments as I actually played the real version a while back.  It was fun, but not necessarily exciting or surprising.  It feels very random and while you have full control of your actions and time, the chaos can overthrow potential options of moves to make.  The fun factor isn't as high as I figured it would be for the light theme and quick gameplay, and if people agree to cooperate, the game can just be too easy if randomness is on your side.

FFG sure packed a lot of gaming goodness into this small box! Once I unpacked it, I had to throw out the insert because it wouldn't all fit back inside!

Nice coo-op, race-against-time disaster-fest!

I found the rules to be complete, but difficult to fully grasp the first few plays. It took me two abortive plays and three full readings of the rules before I finally was playing it correctly. There's a lot of nuance to these rules and they bear a more careful reading than the light subject matter would indicate.

Lastly, in my experience, this is a tough game to beat! Playing with the Less Deadly Dying optional rules is a perfect set of "training wheels" for Gnewer Gnomes.

The mechanics are amusing and fun. Although being able to die early can be brutal. It's best played with someone that really knows the rules inside out or you'll be flipping through the manual looking up edge cases or clarifications.

I wouldn't play this with more than four people because it goes really slow with 5+.

Picked this up at GenCon after watching a demo. I am a big Bruno fan and FF Games as well. The positives: humorous flavor, good art, inexpensive. The disappointing: could that board be any smaller, and it's a bit frustrating, unless we were just having horrid luck in the 2 plays so far. May change the rating later, but IMO, too many events are on the time track to make it fun. Challenge is great if it's balanced, but I currently see this as a constant all-or-nearly-all-just-die anyway after 90 minutes of play. Funny deaths, yes, but too brutal so far.

RATING: 5
It has an interestig mix of mechanics, but Faidutti's hand shows once more in the large amount of chaos in there.

Lower Bruno's trademark chaos elements, and we'd have a good game in our hand. As it is, not my cup of tea

I really liked this, although we were all eaten by the kraken the one time we played. But it is very long. 60 minutes? It was closer to 150 (5 players). Fun, yes, but in that time we could have played three other games which would have been as much fun. Not sure whether I will keep this. It might be quicker with less players.

I'm conflicted on this one.  On the one hand, I'm a big fan of Faidutti's work, it plays up to 8p (!), and no other game I know allows you to nearly drown, catch on fire and then achieve crush depth while counting down a nuclear missile launch.  On the other hand it's really just a filler that takes about an hour-and-a-half too long for what it is.  If it played through in 30 minutes I'd probably give it a nine, easy.  I suppose future plays will tell.  Does it get shorter with familiarity?  Will we be willing to jump in again, and enough, to find out?  Will anyone remember that fires deplete the oxygen track?

When you first start the game there's no real "goal" for players to aim at. A lot of time you end up standing in the same room re-fixing the same problem over and over. The countdown markers don't feel like they are placed far enough ahead to really react to them. If you have someone in the same room as them, great. Otherwise good luck getting there (especially through fire and water) quickly enough.

Might be more fun with the right crowd and more beer but it just felt too random for my tastes.

Quite a bit of luck in the game, but it's of the risk-reward type, where you can automatically deal with a problem, but only at the cost of more problems showing up.  Very nice theme.  Extremely chaotic, but really captures the feeling of a grade B "our sub is sinking" sort of movie.  Plays great solo (controlling 3 gnomes) or with 2 players (each controlling a pair of gnomes).  Box is too small, board doesn't lay flat.  Solid game play with quite a bit of replay value.  Glad I own it.

The rulebook is confusing compared to the game itself.
Always though decision to make! We laughted, we cursed.
Great game! Everybody loved it even person I thought they would not! This game is now a classic to me, and I bought a second one to give it to my father in law.
Played 3 games in 2 days.

UPDATE: We won 2 times on 10 games played. Still have fun. it always feel on the edge from time to time in every games. The events are repetitive but I could say that to almost any video and board games and movies so I accept the game for what it is. 

UPDATE: Don't play with a 3 players or less game. 4 players is the minimum. It's was boring.

There seems to have been a glut of co-operative titles recently, but this isn't one of the better ones. There's no sense of a dire situation spiralling out of control, as in Pandemic, or the brooding suspicion of a traitor, as in Shadows over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica. What you get is a monotonous series of tedious events that you have to tackle with an entirely random mechanism. Avoid this like Soviet submarine duty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not quite up to the standard of the other great recent co-op games. This one is filled with chaos which makes it fun but less strategic than Pandemic. Fun every now and then but I don't know that it's got much staying power beyond a few games.

No variety in the mechanics of the game. Luck plays too big a part in whether you win or lose. A burst of events in a single area can give you no hope of success, but if there is no such burst then it's (relatively) plain sailing. And bad luck can also result in a gnome being eliminated right at the beginning of the game; there's nothing you can do about it (except never using grog).

A light hearted Co-op...this game is oddly cute! I love submarine games, I love co-ops, and I love Grog LOL. The mechanic for using time to completing actions is great and thematic and the unending series of catastrophes really do add tension. This isn't as tense as SOC or Whitechapel, but offers a different feel for the team all together.

First played December 11th, 2008. We played a 4 player game which took about 75 min to play. This is a co-opertive game. You are a gnome and have 60 minutes to be "saved". You spend action point (time) to take care of problems (fire/water/launching nukes) with the sub. If air pressure, engine temp or depth exceed a certain level you lose. Each player wins unless you happen to be passed out and in fire/water. I'd recommend giving this a try if you like co-opertive games and looking for another to try.

I think this game could have a higher rating, however I do not think it was designed well for lots of players.  I have played with six people and all but lost all of them a quarter the way through.

It's a fun coop game, I played it 10-20 times and got tired of it, but it held up until then. Two cool things from this game are a) the time track (see also Patchwork), b) players having the ability to win either with the team or alone. Although, I found that out group played for the team to win so this didn't end up mattering.

A decent co-op.  Theme is certainly fun and the mechanics work.  I enjoy the Thebes timeline combined with the move and action turn sequence.  I wish there was a little more predictablility in the card draw though.  The game is deceptively long.  I've only played with five total players and the games lasted 20 minutes (died very quickly) and 60 minutes (died about 2/3 through).  I think the game would lose a lot of the fun factor with any more than that.  Not enough room in my library for both this and Pandemic, but I'm willing to play this.

RATING: 5
Drunk Gnomes on a submarine is not a premise to be squandered. Right? Each of your gnomes gets more inebriated as the game progresses. Unfortunately, that's where the game's charm leaves off and the tedium takes over. Like other, good cooperatives, crises are in no short supply, but in this one the same few happen over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over... irritated yet? I was. They're all indistinguishable anyway: move a space or two and roll a die. If you want to sit out for a while before your next turn, you could make it an easy role. I mean, why not? It's not like you need to coordinate. One Gnome is as good as the next. Our game was cut short half-way though and I couldn't escape the feeling that it should have been over by then anyway.

I really enjoy co-op games--ARKHAM HORROR is the best of the lot!--& this one was a lot of fun.  The theme is great, the sense of humor is great, the mechanics are well thought out & what game isn't fun without gnomes!  Especially when the gnomes are Soviet ones!  The game brings a sense of panic in trying to solve every horrific event (fires, flooding, reactor over-heating, nuclear missile launch, passed out--drunken--sailor gnomes & a big Kraken that wants to eat you!), as well as a smile to every gamers face.  Excellent game from Fantasy Flight.  It also kind of reminded me of an earlier co-op game I had back in '81 with a sci-fi theme:  AWFUL GREEN THINGS FROM OUTER SPACE.

3/5. Great artwork, amazing theme and it uses the last-player-goes-first turn order mechanic which I love. In theory, I love this game. In practice, I LIKE it but the implementation of the turn mechanic along with the events and little rules for each effect make the game just a bit fiddlier than I want it to be. Good, but it usually stays on the shelf as I don't want to teach it. Once everyone knows what they're doing, though, it's a lot of fun.

I'd much rather play this than, say, Pandemic or Shadows over Camelot in the coop genre. This is a helluva lot of fun in a (perhaps too) small box. Some probably would've liked the serious theme this one had very early in development, but the whimsicality of drunken Soviet gnomes on a probably doomed nuclear submarine is far catchier and likelier to draw a crowd. And it's just a hoot. And hard. There's some fiddliness to the rules, and it's easier to just sit down and try it than learn it from the book, but the player aid cards (only two!) do help. This is the most fun I've had with a new game in quite some time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I've played 1,2, and 3 player.  The theme makes the game seem like it should be fun, but the gameplay, sadly, is quite dry and unengaging.  Ironically for a coop game, I enjoyed this more playing it as a solo 'puzzle' than multiplayer.  Particularly introducing this to new players, it falls flat.  It would probably be better playing when everybody is familiar with the rules...
Wish I could give a higher rating, and will give it some more chances, but a lowly 3.5 for now :(

Great concept, but a bit too much of a mess, especially with lots of players. The game has always lasted longer than I felt it should. The game is funny, but it still falls a bit short for me. Also, it has a very poorly written rule book.

RATING: 6
I'm not too big on cooperative games, and this one is pretty much what I expected.  The novelty of the Jenseits von Theben timing system does nothing for me, the theme is kind of funny to imagine, but not any more interesting than Pandemic, which is essentially the same as most coops - go around and fix the problems popping up.  I think I find the dice rolling a little frustrating, though I'm sure that that's exactly why it was implemented.

But ultimately for a game of this type I think I would prefer it to be shorter.  Which is why I would probably prefer Pandemic over this.  Ideally there would be some sort of traitor aspect (which is what makes BSG a stand-out, even if I dislike SoC, go figure), which I guess this has a little bit, but it's so minor (and happens so late) that it doesn't make that big of a difference.

It's a little annoying that it's hard to get everything back in the box, and I wouldn't mind everything being a little bit bigger, but I think that in the end it was probably a good decision.  The price point is nice and the box size is convenient.

RATING: 6.5
Repeated plays may boost my score.  Some minor issues with components annoyed me a bit and I'm usually forgiving when it comes to components.  But the board was a bit too small, leading to issues when slightly bumping it and the cards should have had a tighter connection to the track they were supposed to increase as it got confusing which track corresponded to what. 

The rulebook also could use some cleaning up as it wasn't easy to read and could have used more examples.  (Were there any?  I don't own it so can't remember).  Too much time spent flipping through the book trying to find something.

Still not too bad.  I suspect after playing it a bit it'll get quicker.  Maybe re-reading the rules after playing it once will help.

A pretty chaotic co-op game based heavily on Jenseits von Theben. Players are gnomes on a sinking submarine trying to keep it floating until help arrives. The idea is good. Execution was okay except for some fiddly rules involving hatches and low water. (i.e. Movement was funny because you spend time opening hatches, but you don't spend time moving).

However like Jenseits, it suffers from a bit of downtime due to the unusual player order. It does take a while to get into and the feeling does get a bit draggy especially with more players. I like the portability although I do agree that this should've been a larger box game. Too many components crammed into a tiny box.

Another heavily themed coop game that I love. So much silly fun. Dwarves piloting an experimental submarine that is malfunctioning in the most spectacular ways you can imagine? A Kraken that attacks you? You get super powers for getting drunk? Getting drunk can make you pass out and horrible things can then happen to you? A way to betray your comrades if the ship looks like its going down? The most fascinating turn order mechanic I've ever encountered? This game has all of that.

Best moment I've experienced in the game so far? We had less than 2 minutes of "game time" left to kill the kraken, the only person who could even possibly succeed had to slam three grog for super powers, leave the sub, roll the right number, and then get back in before drowning. He went out, killed the kraken, and then randomly passed out and drowned outside the sub, BUT his sacrifice let us all live! We'll always remember his drunken selflessness. A true hero among men-dwarves.

A fine cooperative game which surprisingly does well despite the included "funny" theme which also actually fares well. The time/action system is really smart and in order to do well you shouldn't waste time in doing something unuseful and unimportant. This isn't an easy game and there is enough chaos and luck included that players cannot forge a winning strategy or even tactics. You'll just have to go with the flow of the game and hope to stay alive.

This game does not have any interesting decisions. The dice roll mechanic is too repetitive and simplistic. The getting drunk part was meant to be funny but really just means that you have to wait until your next turn to see if you will have one at all.

Cooperative game where every player basically plays every character. Choices seemed obvious most of the time.

We used, as per recommendation, the harder start variant/option.  You draw and apply 4 events before the game even starts...

It is small, compact and filled with great decisions and surprises!
Purely coop, but worth it, if not for the drunkedness that ensues!

I waver back and forth on this game. It's overall a really fun game and I've had some good moments. However, I kind of have to be in the mood, and I do think the rules as written are kind of broken. 

On the plus side, I really like the theme (mostly because I have just always like gnomes as far as classic fantasy creatures are concerned), and the steampunk-y graphics and lulz-factor really help it get to the table among our peer group. On the other hand, lulz-factor often equates to novelty, and to my knowledge, we've never gotten this game to the table with the same people twice, which means we never really explore the deeper strategies behind the game or play it to its fullest potential. 

Which is where my issue with rules as written comes in. The way the game is written, this game is extremely difficult to win. This in of itself isn't a deal breaker - there are lots of similar co-ops where the fact that you never win doesn't take away from the enjoyability. However, it's so difficult that I honestly feel bad introducing it to new people as written, because I feel like it would turn them off from other similar co-ops that aren't so broken. 

We've implemented a couple of house rules that makes the game significantly easier to win, at the expense of complexity and strategy, but I'm not sure if we'll ever play the game as it was actually intended. Regardless, it's still fun to play and comes out often enough.

A tense little cooperative experience with a nice push-your-luck action point system.

This game gets a lot of flak but works very well as a solo coop. Having discovered that I don't like games where my character is at risk (Hunters traded for this reason) this game comes closest to a disaster theme with comedy. It can seem overlong but the key is to keep moving and exploit the turn-order rule to leapfrog crew ahead. The time tracker mechanism takes a bit of grokking but is brilliantly simple. From the designer of Citadels, another elegant game.

A wee bit too luck driven, but it's both thematic and short, so can be a blast if all players are in the right mood. Also, I'd rather play a co-op where I feel I'm leaning against the ropes than one where I consistently win, even if that means veering towards a luck-oriented design.

The second edition is subtitled "Revised edition".
I don't even want to imagine what would be a "not revised edition".

The rules booklet is disorganized and makes the reading and learning a real pain, even by Fantasy Flight standards.

Furthermore it has no index. On our first game it took us more thant 15 minutes just to find the point of rule on how to put the kraken card in play.
Some of the cards feature the wrong text which should simply not happen on a second edition.

The symbols on the time track are right in the middle of the spaces so that during consequences phase you have to lift the player markers to check if there is a symbol under them.
Otherwise you can put the player markers around the edges of the game board but then you have to be very careful not to move the board.

The "draw event" symbol on the time track is the same as the one on the back of the item cards, which causes much confusion with new players.

Okay, I guess I just don't like pure cooperative games. The game is done well, although quite fiddly with the various bits, and some of the mechanics are interesting, but matching wits against a game that is based on luck just doesn't seem to interest me all that much. Has some tension, and might be fun everyone once in awhile.

Thank you so much King Friday!

Another addition to the emerging genre of "meet the threats as they arrive" cooperative games.

As often when Faidutti is involved, the rules sound fidgety and overly complex but flow quite well once in game. The theme is funny and there is one mechanic I like especially in Red November, it's the choice given to a player to betray everyone after so much work to survive as a team. My main gripe with this game is that playing it feels so automatic: there is very little choice in what to do, you mainly have to react to what is happening. Which perhaps explains why the game feels so unsatisfying when the team manages to save the submarine. This is a game that is actually more fun when you lose!

The setup this time is to rescue your gnomes from a sinking submarine.  The small map reinforces the claustrophobic atmosphere, although it really would have helped the gameplay to be bigger.  Otherwise, the pieces and tokens are all nicely done.  

Two players isn't optimal, so we ended up playing 2 gnomes each.  Unfortunately, the game really didn't do anything for us.  There was a lot of bookkeeping in moving each gnome, catching up the time mechanism, and triggering and resolving each event.  Although there are a lot of events, they aren't too different from each other, so it seemed to lack variety (oh, another fire?)  We also didn't find the decisions to be too interesting---you could always spend the full 10 minutes to solve each event, and the tension in trying to make more efficient use of your time didn't feel like it was there.  On the other hand, playing with only one gnome apiece would probably not trigger enough events.

We ended up playing this with three players and it still didn't click with any of us (and she was a huge fan of [thing=30549][/thing]).  It doesn't look like we'll be sailing with gnomes very much.

Russian gnomes, trying desperately to keep their sub from succumbing to crushing depths, reactor malfunction, random missile launches, and kraken attack, while fires, floods and blocked hatches frustrate them at every turn. I lost my first solitaire attempt (6 gnomes, learning the mechanics) and my first paired play (2 gnomes each) at this game, and still find I love it. Heavier in the mechanics than your average gateway, lot of bits, and it has a turn-taking mechanism I'd never seen before, but the mechanics are straightforward once learned, so after a play or two you should be able to keep track of Red November fairly easily. Packed in a really small box, it's great for taking in a suitcase, horrible for trying to put back away after you play it.

Fun game of randomness where you try and survive a submarine that is both flooding and on fire
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first thing that has to be said about this game is that for all of the nifty bling you get, the quality of the art and the sophistication of the game itself, Fantasy Flight could have charged three times as much. God bless 'em.

The game flows pretty well after some initial fiddliness. The main problem with a game that simulates a panicky, life-threatening situation like this but that doesn't have time limits on turns (like, say, NIGHTMARE or SPACE ALERT) is that in spite of the drama of the situation being depicted, it can come to seem like a pretty abstract exercise.

A cooperative game where you are on the Red November submarine designed by Gnomes.  I think there was a Salvatore novel that references it, or some other crazy gnome ship in one of his Drizzt novels.  It is a wacky game where you are trying to plug holes and keep the Red November from imploding.  One of the players I played with bought the game that night and I thought it was one of the worst co-ops I have ever played.  It could be that the theme put me off.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another co-op I enjoy. This one is just fun and silly. You are gnomes trying to survive in a sinking submarine long enough for help to arrive. There are floods and fires, and the only way you can muster up enough courage to fight these things...is by drinking. Its a goofy game that needs to be played with the right group of people.

RATING: 5
Played a bunch of times with 2 - 6 players.

Yet another game some friends liked and I disliked.  I'd rather play any of the number of co-ops that have been released in recent years.  The board and components are tiny which makes the game a very "fiddly" experience; if the components were more playable, I might like the game more.  The theme has potential to be fun, but does not deliver.  I find the gameplay less than impressive given its relative lack of opportunity for real strategy and the high chance of a random series of cards putting victory out of reach.  Randomness would better fit a shorter game.

Not interested in playing again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

9/2009 Another collaborative boardgame - these seem more popular lately?  RedNovember is a much simpler rendition than, say, Pandemic.  Luck has a big influence, planning is next to impossible and the events pushing the game along are very repetitive.  Fun for a laugh - and drinking grog gives a bonus on any action.

12/2009 Further comparisons leaves this a one of the weaker silver line FFGs.  I'll unlikely suggest it for play.  Rating down 6 -> 5.

This is not a "serious" game, and I think it really requires a few drinks and some humorous banter to be any fun. The theme encourages this way of playing (gnomes on a submarine!). The rules aren't particularly well-written, so the first game is a bit of a stumble-through.

An deftly light-hearted handling of a potentially gruesome theme.

Fun take on the co-op model, which draws some very obvious inspiration from other co-ops.  Doesn't bring a whole lot to the table that other co-ops haven't already brought, but offers a unique and humorous theme, and a lot of meat packed into a small and economic package.  I would recommend this to people who love co-ops and can't get enough, or one who wants to try one out.

If you already have a couple of the more popular co-ops like Shadows or Pandemic, and you're not necessarily looking for more of the same (mostly) then I don't know that this would merit a purchase.

The Gnomish sub Red November is falling apart all around you, and it is up to you and your friends to fix it up enough to stay alive. But too many things can go wrong, and thats where the fun is! Fires, floods, missiles and a Kraken! All will need to be dealt with and all of them present good points for discussion and strategies among the group.

Rules sound more complex than they really are. Lots of components stuffed into that little box!

RATING: 2
This game looked so promising: great company, great line (the Silver series), great theme...but it sucks monkey dicks.

It's twice as long as it needed to be, comes in a box that's way too small (resulting in a miniscule, irritating board), doesn't involve enough variety to sustain it's stupidly long play time, and at the end of the day just isn't as much fun as a game where you play drunken Russian gnomes aboard a doomed, malfunctioning submarine should be.

As an added bonus, if you get knocked out you can spend well over an hour waiting to get to do anything again -- which is what happened to one player during my group's first and only playthrough, which we gave up on at the halfway point.

This is one of the worst games I've ever played. It's likely that not shoehorning it into a micro-box, which would give it a full-sized board, would improve things, but I suspect monkey dicks would still be gargled.

1 / 5 - Bad.

Yet another "meh" co-operative game with nothing to distinguish it from all the other "meh" co-operative games that seem to be all the rage nowadays except a grindingly un-funny theme involving drunken gnomes. Not enough variety. Nothing to alleviate the tedium of being bossed about by the most experienced player. Nothing to actually encourage discussion and co-operation.

RATING: 6
Enjoyably chaotic co-op with an interesting 'time' mechanic; seems pretty hard to win and I think this is due to reliance on luck, but if you fancy a bit of fun in a doomed submarine, then this'll play 8 people with some downtime. If a player 'faints' then they can be sitting out for quite some time, which can be super-dull for them.

NL: Met zijn allen zit je in een duikboot waarin van alles misgaat: er breken brandjes uit, ruimtes komen onder water te staan, raketten dreigen te ontploffen in de lanceringsbuizen, etc. 

De reddingsploeg komt pas over een uur. Je moet het zien te overleven tot die tijd, dus ga je dingen fixen, al dan niet nadat je een stevige teug vodka hebt genomen.

I don't dislike this game, but I'd never consider it one of my favorites.  I've only played games with 3 players, but we've never had any difficulty beating it.  There's rarely any feelings of tension or impending doom, which is a huge hit against my potential enjoyment of this game.  In a recent session, one of the players asked "When does this become fun?", and I had to agree that it really hasn't been in the few times we've played thus far.  The rulebook is quite confusing, so I need to read through some session reports to make sure we're doing everything correctly, but thus far I'm not a big fan of this game.  However, a recent play with 6 characters might change my opinions about it, as we finally experienced the tension this game needs, which resulted in a much more entertaining experience.

Game in a Nutshell: Play as alcoholic Gnomes cooperating to keep their submarine in survivable condition for the 60 minutes it will take for the rescue team to find them. 

Played as: solo (w/ 3 gnomes), 2 player (w/ 2 gnomes each)

Pros:  I enjoy that they took a game that could have been produced at 4 times the size and 3 times the cost and fit it into such a small affordable package without compromising quality or cheapening the experience. The presentation, from artwork to plastic gnomes is top notch. Fun theme with an excellent sense of humor. Does a good job of engrossing players in the theme by making your sub start to feel like a submersible tuna-can as time passes and the added chaos of scrambling around in order to survive. The time mechanic (ripped off from Thebes) works naturally.

Cons:  Waaay too long for what it is: Move, do an action (btw- almost all completely identical) with random results, followed by a bunch more random bad stuff... rinse and repeat. That would have been fine, excellent even, in 30 minutes but this game can easily approach 2+ hours! Did I mention all the actions are pretty much completely identical? There’s like 7-8 different things that need fixing at any given time and they are all fixed the same way: spend minutes, roll a single die. Variety? That comes in the way of fiddly rules like remembering what conditions do you need to meet to leave the sub, go in a room that’s on fire, how many items is allowable to take, what are the rules to dying, and so on. The game doesn’t develop fully with 3-4 players (never needed to fight the Kraken) but the extended playing time of having more players seems excruciating.  The thought of trying this with a full 8 people gives me a migraine of Twilight Imperium sized proportions.

Other:  I’ve rated this game so poorly almost entirely due to its length. The randomness, repetition, and even fiddly rules I could’ve dealt with because the theme and experience are so rich.  But I just can’t stand that it drags on for an eternity. Almost a fun game... almost.

Best Use:  As a drinking game maybe... fire starts, take a drink; room floods, take a drink... maybe you’ll get lucky and pass out before the Red Nov-hangover begins.

(After one play with seven players)

It's cute and mildly amusing (probably more so with just the right group). The idea is pretty good. The theme is pretty well integrated into game play. It's easy to pick up the rules as you go along: Just let a couple of the more experienced players go first, and you'll have most of the mechanics down just like that.

I suspect, but can't be certain at this point, that it's really hard to win. But I really did not like the tiny, and I mean tiny, game board. I know that the small, cramped board ties into the theme, but enough is enough. There's just not enough room.

I guess for the price, what do you expect? But even 25 percent bigger would have been fantastic. It's maybe a 5 with a bigger board, but it's a 4 with the little one.

Apparently they made it bigger at some point, and no one sent me a memo about it. I still don't really need to play it again.

Spiel bei und mit Caro&Matthias ausprobiert. War nicht so der Burner sondern eher ein wenig langweilig. Ist ein kooperatives Spiel, bei dem die Spieler in die Rolle von Gnomen schlüpfen und versuchen auf dem Boot roter November lange genug zu überleben, bis Hilfe eintrifft. Allerdings wirken die Mechanismus zur Steuerung recht unpräzise und beliebig. Die Schicksalsschläge erfolgen hingegen präzise alle drei Minuten, die die Spieler auf der 60 Minuten umfassenden Zeitleiste, bis zur ersehnten Rettung allesamt zurücklegen müssen. Das Spiel plätscherte so dahin und konnte in unserer Runde keinen so richtig überzeugen. Bin kein großer Fan von kooperativen Spielen, aber dieses im besonderen bietet für mich schlicht und ergreifend keinen Wiederspielreiz. Dann doch lieber noch ein Winter der Toten.

This game is quick and fairly fun- After a dozen or so plays, I have downgraded my rating of this game. I am not sure why, but I just don't enjoy it much. I like the idea/theme, I like the time chart and how it works and I like that is Co-operative. I think it needs to be a bit more complex... or have a bigger board or something...

Cute little game about trying to save a failing sub.  Comical nature, with the option to betray everyone and flee the ship make this quite entertaining.  Borrows from Awful Green Things and Jenseuits von Theben, but in good ways.  For the size package, it does pack quite a bit in.  Plays pretty fast as well.

Decent game, but easy to mess with the system. I found it too easy if you just advance the time meter as fast as you can to get out. I'd play again if given the chance, and I may re-acquire it at some point, too, to give it another shot.

Players are gnomes on a nuclear sub that's going to explode if doesn't flood or burn-up first.  If players can escape within the allotted time, before dying, they win.  The turn-order is based off of the time mechanic first seen in "Around the World in 80 Days" and "Jenseits von Theben".

A great premise but I found it tedious running around putting out fires and fixing parts of the ship.  There's an escape hatch to add some potential competition and I wish the game had more of that type of idea as the underlying game-engine is sufficient but kind of boring.  Perhaps I'm just getting burned-out on these group-think co-op games.

RATING: 7
Fun little game but it should ONLY be played with 3-4 players max.  Even though the mechanics can scale just fine with more players (up to 8), the actual fun involved is inversely lowered the more players you have.  There is just too much downtime involved because not only do you likely have to wait for the other 7 people to do their turns, if they all end with their tokens on top of yours you have to wait for them to take a SECOND turn before you get to go again!  You get bored, your attention wanders, and all the tension and excitement go right out the window.

But with 3 or 4 this game is very intense and fun!

Played once (and lost 37 game-minutes into the game).

You're playing gnomes on a sub destined for the bottom (or a Kraken's stomach), and only by working together can all the players fix all the sub's problems before it sinks.  With one small exception the players play as a team: they either all win together, or they all lose.

The game is dripping with theme.  As you run around the sub trying to fix things, disasters are happening all around you: rooms are flooding, fires are breaking out, equipment is breaking, and doors are getting jammed. The turn-order system is very neat: to do anything in the game players must spend "time"; as they do this they move their pieces along a time-track (that surrounds the board).  The player who's furthest behind in time is the next to go, and they move their token up however many "minutes" their turn lasts (and thus a person can potentially take multiple turns in a row, which is essential for trading items).  As players move along the time track they also trigger random events (floods, fires, etc.), none of which are good. Once everyone's counter has finished moving around the track the game is over and the team has won.  If disasters get out of control before that time, the team has lost.

There is a sense of urgency in the game, as lots and lots of things are going wrong.  Early on we could handle the problems individually, but after a short while everyone had to work together (trading items and planning out who would do what action in a complex sequence of actions) in a desperate attempt to solve the biggest problems on the sub.  

I love the theme, and love the working-together aspect of the game.  The game isn't as high-stress as I thought it would be initially (since the turns can be a bit slow), but it certainly does torture the poor gnomes, and there is a great sense of teamwork (or, if there isn't, the sub is going to sink).  

The game theoretically holds from 3-8, but I'd be hesitant to play with more than 5 players, as even our game with four players had the potential for a lot of player down-time (as the time-track turn mechanism means that players may have to wait a long time in between turns).  Once things get stressful, though, everyone starts to chip in to plan things and the down-time isn't a big deal.

I'd highly recommend printing out "RangerRob's Red November Box-Size Reference Guide" (http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/41072), as it's better designed than the included player-aid and you'll need more copies of player aids anyway (as the game only comes with two, and they're very useful for explaining the rules).

Sorry Red November, you're just not as good as Pandemic. Sure you're fun and chaotic, but something is missing. I think its the lack of a special power for every gnome. Pandemic has this (well not gnomes, but scientists), and the presence or absence of these powers on the table adds mightily to the replay value.  Also, a bit wonky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This will probably be the first game where I throw out the insert. It's out of necessity, as the little baggie of plastic gnomes doesn't want to fit back under it. Pandemic's insert is pretty useless as well.

Oh, and I just got these last night and haven't played Red November yet.

Wife and I played once - she found me setting up the board for a dry run and jumped in. We lost when we couldn't unstick a hatch and the sub overheated or something.

NEEDS A BIGGER BOARD AND PIECES. Dear god.

Traded for Carcassonne: The Castle. Red November isn't bad just never makes its way to the table.

RATING: 3
After three fast plays I can definitively state that this game will add some nice Grog flavor to our regular repertoire. Maybe not as strategic or intense an experience as Pandemic or BSG, but what's not to like about Gnomes running around putting out fires and getting drunk?

---------------

Update - this is definitely not a game for more than five. In fact, I think three players may be the ideal number. Too much going on, too much to harm the players, and WAY too much down time between turns. In the end, we ended up just quitting midway through a game to play something else. A bad sign.

The board game equivalent of being a Cleveland Browns fan.  It's not a question of if you'll lose, but when and how you'll lose (and it's a co-op, mostly, so everyone has the "pleasure").

To that backdrop, add in tedious, repetitive gameplay, with absolutely no sense of satisfaction for accomplishing the meager goals laid out in the rules, and a spontaneous traitor mechanic that feels refreshingly like a mercy killing on the rare occasion that someone pulls it off.

Don't.  Play.

A fun game with an infectiously silly theme. Best played with fewer players, as the game becomes exponentially more difficult and wears out its welcome swiftly with more than about 4.

As of 2011, there is a reprint with a bigger board.

Okay coop with great theme. The game is fine for the first 3-4 playthroughs, however it soon becomes obvious that there really aren't very many decisions to be made. All the crisis events that occur are all handled in the exact same way. Whether it's a fire that needs putting out or an oxygen pump fixing, the way you deal with them is the same. Nothing happens to change the game play. The same criticism could be levelled at Forbidden Island, but at least in that the layout changes every game and each character plays differently. 

The timing mechanism is great but I just wish it had been better implemented. Getting your gnomes drunk is funny but it's not usually a risk worth taking. 

The betrayal element is cool but it hardly ever happens. 

The game is screaming out for variable player powers to make each gnome feel different and to shake things up game to game. 

The components are fantastic and it looks great on the table but there's not enough here for me to keep it.

Just plain dire! 

The board is too small and the pieces too fiddly. It needs an extra time track for the white time marker. If you take long actions (to actually do something useful) you then just ist around!

I really enjoy co-operative games such as Pandemic, Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot, Space Alert etc. which really show how a cooperative game should be designed.

If you think the submarine theme is for you, I would really recommend you play Space Alert instead, which shows how good such a game can be.

Gnomes in a submarine getting drunk? This is a hillarious theme!

The game itself is ok. There is quite of bit of randomness with a mix of "push your luck". This equates to a light game without a lot of control. This is not necessarily a bad in my opinion, but reduces my desire to always play this game.

The game is great for a cooperative game that is easily transported and can handle a large number of players. I often carry this game on my business trips.

Peppy, chaos filled co-op.  Love the theme.  The tension wasn't quite where I would have liked it towards the end of the game, however.  Co-ops should build to a crescendo of do-or-die moments, but instead the tension ramped up nicely at the start and then plateaued.  Still, an enjoyable experience overall...though not necessarily one I'd want to play with 8 people.

A co-op game where players are dwarves on a sinking submarine.  Turns are played by a clever mechanism using time instead of actions so that over the course of the game every player is essentially using the same amount of time.  Fires erupt, hatches break open allowing water to enter, and other various accidents that the players need to deal with so that the submarine stays operational.

A, just OK, co-op that has a silly theme and is fun to play when taken less seriously.

I demo'd this at a GenCon a couple years ago. Then I played a 2 player game when I got it. It just fell flat for me. I'll try it again with 4 or 5 players to see what it is like, but it is probably heading the way of the trade.

RATING: 7.5
A good cooperative game. Some of the rules are less than intuitive, which takes the game down a notch, but once you've got them down the game is quick and fun. The time mechanic in particular is pretty interesting, and rewards risking lower bonuses to your fix-it rolls. And the theme is priceless.

RATING: 4
First impression (5 players): First of all I don't like how the game is a miniature version of a boardgame. Especially for the time marker pieces the board is too small. 

The game itself has a fun theme and I sort of like the chaotic nature of how everything on the sub seems to be be breaking at any moment. However I don't like a bit too chaotic nature of succeeding/failing in tasks. Choosing between 1-10 against rolling a die isn't really the most interesting mechanic. Also the gameplay suffers the same problem as most cooperative games seem to, a repetetive gameplay. Here it bothered me more than in the other cooperative games. Especially in Red November some players might simply be stuck on doing same task again and again without too much else to do and that isn't really too much fun.

I like the theme a lot but gameplay is too chaotic for my taste.

Very compactly packaged co-op game. Played three times now and the first game (4 players) we were heavilly defeated, but on both the next two(4p & 2p), we survived without even coming close to losing. The fact that once we'd gotten a handle of the game and survived so easily gives me a little concern that the game is quite easy. But I think that would be an unfair assumption to make so soon. I'll see what more plays bring..

Had this one on my radar for a long time, but maybe just on the outside of my scope. Then, in June of 2011, a fellow BGG member made a good offer, so I traded for it, in hopes maybe my family would be interested in playing a relatively easy cooperative game. As regards the rule book, it's one of those in which the problem is not with what's in it so much as what's not--although it seems obvious to me that it could have been much better organized. But I imagine anyone who tries to learn this is going to have a lot of questions for which they'll have to search out answers. Rules are kind of fiddly, so this seems to me to be more a gamer-group game than a family one. Don't know if there was a problem with translation or what--two individuals are listed under "editing"--but I have many Fantasy Flight games, and the clarity of their rulebooks tends to trail the quality of the artwork in them (case in point: "Cold War: CIA vs. KGB"). Sold, January 2014.

Nice gaming concept. Somehow it made us thinking of something between a co-operative game (where one in the end still can pull the victory to his side) and a role play (with the drunken sailor).

Wow! Fun game in a very small package! This sub is wracked with terrible problems...one disaster after another! Just imagine being in a sub...on fire...taking on water...being attacked by the cracken...missles overheating...air depleting! These gnomes really have it bad...how are they ever to survive? Well they need a little liquor to help them along...but not too much or they could pass out! Send your gnomes on errands all throughout the sub to keep the sub intact...but your efforts are nothing more than a bandage on an already sinking sub...so keep trying...maybe you can get more tokens to stay alive long enough to be rescued. Or...if you are sick of it all...you can swim for it and let the others go down with the sub!

Stylish game with a cute theme but cooperatives bore me and I found this game long and random. Having a player miss turns for several rounds is a terrible mechanic. (Seriously, miss-a-go rules are something out of a children's roll and move game.) I felt really sorry for the unconscious player who had to wait quarter of an hour before she could do something. Playing this just felt like a gimmicky idea had been spun into a board game too big to support the novelty.

The problem is that in most situations there's not much debate or tension about what the best thing to do is. It's either obvious, or doesn't matter much. And the die rolls can be very aggravating when you just miss, or do a guaranteed time allocation and roll a 1, or move through a sequence of turns trying to roll 1's to minimise time loss - not much fun. Great theme though and that's the one thing that may provide enough entertainment for a few more plays.

Two plays for me so far, and I died in each, leaving my kids (13, 11, and 9) to carry on and save the sub.

I practically had to pry them away from it to send them to bed.

Cooperative. Played once. Steady stream of mini-disasters. Fire? Find an extinguisher and roll a die. Flood? Find a pump and roll a die.

Cooperative game, but inferior to Pandémie. I got the sense that this is more an individual game than team game. Sure, it gives to newbie people the sense that they actually contribute, but I don't find it as fun. Also, early game is very boring, you just wait for bad things to come up, while in Pandémie you get with infected cities right off the bat.

I like its small, portable box, but that's about it. For what it offers, it's a very long game; Pandémie will finish in 45 minutes at most, this could take 1.5 - 2 hours.

A cute little co-op game. Players run around the ship trying to manage the various disasters that occur. It's virtues are the short playing time and how it can accommodate a variety of players.

This is a complete coop that really fits in a small box without feeling that it is not complex. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of different tokens.

OWN: ORIGINAL EDITION [NOT 'Revised Edition', which has bigger board, item cards & clarified rules]

Crazy, frantic co-op game with a great theme. Can be quite tough to beat.

Loads of (good quality) components crammed in such a small box.

WARNING: Can be played by 2 players ("2 players" printed on back of some boxes is actually an error), but requires controlling multiple pieces each for best results (which is actually very manageable and doesn't detract from the fun).

Once upon a time there was only the One, and now we are flooded with co-operative designs. Red November has a quirky and strong narrative which imaginative players can have fun with, but I don't find the 'alcohol' element entertaining, especially if rendered unconscious and you have to wait till everyone catches up. Sure it's 'funny' to witness, but if it happened to me I would find the wait boring. The design feels to me so dated, it has modifiers to strengthen the narrative, but it just bogs down the proceedings, as does the numerous die rolls. I realise how elegant Pandemic is now after playing Red November, as well as more skill is required to card count, rather than the overbearing chaos of the event cards inflicting the sub.

It's a nice idea, where players are running around a sub trying to fix things as other things break, but the events were a little too punishing in terms of forcing you to discard your items, or having characters fall over asleep after one drink due to a bad card flip. It was also odd because many times players wouldn't have anything in reach to do based on the items they had, but they would need to find a way to burn time so another player's turn would come up.

Despite the near doubling of the size of the components from the 1st edition, the box is still fairly small, and so it is not a terrible tradeoff to have cards replace the chits. The rules are so terrible it took me ten plays to get to nearly having them all down, need to make a summary sheet for my own reference. With three players you actually have pretty good odds to win. Four gives you best blend of madness and manageability.

A ok coop game, without the traitor option working at cross purposes to the majority of players. However, one player can gain a "run away" option.

The timeline approach scales the number of players with the number of bad things happening. The game lures you to play probabilities as you try to minimize time spent fixing one items.

Like most coop games - the game system hates you I like how the evil things happening is dependent on time spent not just on turns.

This is a fun "oh crap" game in which anything that can go wrong will... and does spectacularly.  In order to "get in the mood" of the game, I would suggest a brew of your choice, perhaps with a side-rule that everytime your gnome has to use grog for an incident, you down one too!  It's a light, fast paced game that everyone should try at least once.

Kind of reminded me of Sucking Vacuum.  The "Thebes" timetrack is an interesting mechanic, but with 7 new players playing the game it takes waaaayyyy too long to get to your next turn.  Definitely kind of humorous, but not humorous enough to warrant a second play.  Well, I would give it another chance with 4 or less players.  At least it would move quicker.

This game is a lot more challenging than it seems.  So far, we have not won.  It's fairly frustrating to be a drunk passed out gnome waiting for death.  But at least it isn't as simple as I was afraid that it might be.  I do like working with my fellow players to try to beat the evil malfunctioning sub.  I also enjoy hoping certain compartments will burn or flood because they are already burning or flooded.  Good stuff.

A cooperative game that's not much like any other i've tried. The time track is a neat idea and puts a lot of interesting pressure on the players. I like that the game supports a lot of players, even if it's not necessarily best with a lot. I like the newer 2nd edition better than the 1st. Something about the larger cards and components that just appeals to me.

RATING: 3
Mostly a re-theming of Shadows Over Camelot. Okay, not really, but it has almost all the features I dislike about SOC: no really interesting problems to solve, no competition, endless gabbling with every other player before you can make your own move. On top of that it's even more luck-heavy than SOC. At least you're not expected to double-talk around the cards in your hand.

So I don't like cooperative games. Sue me.

RATING: 7
Played once as of 1/11/10 and had a blast.  We laughed a lot at the hazards springing up on the ship (lets just say our sub should have been called the SS Tinderbox as suggested by one of my friends).  We ended up surviving after narrowly avoiding a double missle launch malfunction in the last 1/3 of the game making the ending pretty tense.

I wish the components were a little larger, but I'm guessing the component size allows this game to keep a low price point - which is good for this game.  I am concerned that after repeated plays it may not have a lot of staying power.  However, its a great game to break out with the right crowd.  Joking about how screwed you are, how drunk your gnome is, how absurd the fires springing up left and right are, etc makes for a lot of laughter and a good time.  Its worth a purchase.

Tough to win co-op.  I play most frequently with my 3 (almost 4) year old. He loves it and although he can't read he has memorised the words on each of the crisis cards. Not sure I'd play it that much without him as it can get a bit monotonous.

Dec 14 - played it twice recently - tediously repetitive.  My now 6 year old felt likewise. The rulebook is very badly set out, making it extremely annoying to search through for rules checks. I don't normally sell or trade my games no matter how little I enjoy them, but may have to make an exception for this.

I've played two new true co-operative games (as opposed to games with a traitor) this week and this was the more dissapointing of the two. It contains some clever mechanics but it has really failed to look at what works in other co-operative games.
The resolution of problems (various threats to the ship your Gnomes inhabit) is based on a random mechanism. Ghost Stories showed this didn't work. There are so many random things going on in this sort of co-operative already that it makes it feel like the game is sweeping you along, instead of you actively participating. And secondly it hasn't grasped the thorny problem of how you differentiate a co-operative game from a solo play game (essentially why shouldn't the best player at the table just make everyones moves for them?)

(08/20/09) - This just came in the mail today from the UPS dude. I'm looking forward to some lighthearted co-op.

(05/22/13) - [6] - With a handful of games under my belt, I'm giving Red November a rating of 6. Perhaps because I have not yet "solved" the game, the base version is absolutely brutal with three players. Switching to a six-sided dice makes things a bit too easy, but it also allows the game to go longer than 10 minutes. The gameplay itself is the usual "everything goes wrong at once, do your best" co-op mechanic. Without a traitor mechanic a la Shadows Over Camelot or BSG, the fun level suffers a bit.

SOLD (04/14/2017) - I feel like this title had a lot of potential, but ultimately was pretty disappointing.

I gave this game a pre-emptive 6 - but I was wrong. Once you learn how to play.. and the caveats of the rules... this is a GREAT 2 to 4 player game. (in 2 player, each of you controls 2 dudes).

I didnt like the damage-control co-op with this game at first- but it grew on both of us. The more we played it the more fun we had and now its a staple and tons of replay. Love it!

----
We bought it and have not played it yet. After playing it I will give it a different score.

This is because even though we are pretty hardcore board gamers, the rules, and the rule-sheet, are ridiculous.

They are not organized well, there are caveats all over the place, and the mechanics are odd.

We bought the version with the larger board, and I must say after seeing the smaller board, this makes a huge difference.

You would think that after playing Arkham and Ghost Stories, I could figure out the rules. But every time I sit down with them, by the time I am through reading, I don't want to play the dang game. They are so DISORGANIZED, omg.

again, after playing, I will re-rate this game. If we ever play it. So far it just sits on the shelf while Ghost Stories and Small World and Robo-Rally and Plato 3000 and Aquarius get all the play time...

RATING: 6
 A decent and funny coop game, crippled by a horrible rulebook and excessive downtime when playing with more than 4-5 players.
 I guess that putting a "1-8 players" tag in a box increase sales, but here it's quite clear that the game just don't works with more than 5 at all. Because of the time-slotted actions, you can very well wait 10-15 minutes to get your next turn is some situations, then maybe play a couple of turns in succession, and then wait 10 minutes again. The thing is, it works nicely with up to 4 or maybe 5 players, but crumbles because of the downtime with more.

 It's an OK game to fire now and then, if your group can play it fast, to keep it flowing, because if it gets much longer than an hour, there isn't really enough choices nor long planning to keep it interesting.

Solo Player Value = Poor

Two Player Value = Poor

Three Player Value = Poor


Red November is a game that I really want to like.  But I cannot.  The game simply misses in many key areas.

Red November is a cooperative game where players work together to save a sinking submarine.  Sounds great.

The game does have a few positives going for it: co-op game play, nice artwork and good components.  The game play is easy and clean as well so the game plays smoothly and quickly.  The theme is fantastic and fits the game wonderfully.  

The rules are well written and easy to learn from.

The time keeping mechanic is stolen from Thebes, which a good thing.  That is a fantastic time mechanic.  It has been modified a bit to fit this game and works very well. 

So far the game sounds fine.

But the bad begins once you start playing.  

Quickly you figure out that the game is dull.  There just isn't much to do in the game.  Most of the time you are stalling and wasting time, waiting for something bad to happen so you have something to do.

Even when something bad does happen and death is eminent, it is extremely easily corrected and avoided.  There is a complete lack of tension and feeling of doom.

It is boring.

In fact, I have played a game where I literally did nothing the entire game and I still won.  That is ridiculous.  Why bother playing at all if you can do nothing and win?

And at other times, you can die for no apparent reason besides blind luck.  The best I can figure is that you have about a 10% chance to die each turn for no reason.  I understand telling a player he will die unless he corrects a negative situation within a certain time period.  But this is instant death with with no recourse.  It is a bad mechanic.

There is not much to like in this game.

I played Red November 5 times prior to writing this.  Once truly solo, once alone but controlling multiple characters and three times with a varied amount of players.  It was the same boring game regardless of the number of players.

I feel I have given Red November a fair chance.  It is not a good game.

A great coop game.  Cooperation like in pandemic, with a turn order mechanic taken from Thebes.  Silly and tense at the same time.  This game manages to retain the sense of doom without being so damned hard that it's impossible.  I love that killing off fellow gnomes is somewhat viable and the fact that there is an option to leave the sub early (thus leaving your gnomish comrades to deal with the mess.

Sucked the first time with just two, but got better with 3. I still don't know how many times I will play this in my life. If it actually had any resale value, I would probably sell it.

This is an interesting game because of the time mechanic; but after a few plays the charm of it wore a bit thin. I'm certainly glad to have played the game; but I believe it's been replaced by more interesting cooperative games. 

The artwork does give it a distinctive look and a certain charm.

Bought the second edition because I was certain that I would enjoy the larger board (correct) and the cards rather than the original tokens (mixed). 

I found the game was more challenging at higher player counts, making the larger set more practical; but I also found the original more portable and still own both at the moment.

Sadly, with so many better cooperative game choices on the market, it is not hitting the table very often.

I don't have many expectations from co-operative games, therefore, I wasn't really disappointed by that one. However, with 8 players, the downtime was annoying and I should give this game a 3. On the other hand, I did like the components and the compact/travel style of the game. Therefore, I would try it again with less players (5 maximum) and see what happens.

Funny and simple co-op. The time track is nice and the die gives you a little push-your-luck element. The theme helps a lot, so if you don't like it, you propably don't like the game.

Hmmm I don't feel so much excitment playing this game - mainly because it was easy. Of course in first game we died within 11 minutes of game or so, but we weren't experienced and... well still I wasn't feeling excitment. Rather I wanted to play it again to play more time and then we won...

Not as much as playing: Pandemic or Ghost Stories. I want to play, because I want to try it with more players (5 or more). I played with 3.

As far as cooperative games go, this one is merely ok.  We played with 6 players and it moved very slowly.  It certainly is challenging to win but there are many better cooperative games out there.  I don't really need to play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It isn't as controllable as something like Pandemic, and the game seems virtually impossible with more than four people, but even as your sub goes down in flames (underwater, no less), you will have lots of fun laughing at the crazy die rolls and goofy theme. It's nice to have a game that doesn't take itself very seriously.

Again, I like the mad-science theme (and I always play gnomes in RPGs) and like co-operation, but I do tend to find the gameplay rather lacking. The game plays quite well, and you do get a feeling of panic as malfunction after malfunction occurs over the ship. As it happens, I do think the game tends towards the easy side of things...

Still can't get the thing back in the box, though.

I've enjoyed Red November so far, although it kinda feels more like the "travel-sized" version of a bigger game.  My first two wins seemed to come a little too easy, but as my gnomish crew has gone down with their little sub in all subsequent games, maybe it is well balanced after all.  Having only ever played with two players (each using two gnomes), I want to try Red November out with a bigger group... [NEED TO UPDATE]

There's kind of an optimum way to play this and once you've figured out that half flooded rooms will keep the fires down, camping in the main rooms is effective for dealing with emergencies, playing the clock cleverly is better than rushing around... well then, it's up the the die rolls really. It's a decent game, but the market for decent games is crowded. I commend FFG for packing so much into a little box - I thank them for not selling this as a big game box with a big game price. If only some other game companies took their lead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pleasant surprise from a game that I didn't have too much expectations.  Very intuitive and tense cooperative game in which the crew is trying to survive in a sinking submarine, meanwhile the help arrives.  There is a kind of traitor mechanic, since anyone with the proper equip can try to escape from the sub leaving their mates behind.  Perhaps its flaw is that it can be felt repetitive, since the mechanism to fix the problems is the same in every case.

If you took Pandemic, put it on a submarine and changed the characters to gnomes who like to drink, you'd have something awfully similar to Red November.  Instead of viral outbreaks you deal with flooded compartments, fires, reactor meltdowns and Krakens just to name a few of the events you will face which impact on your life support.

Don't have the right tool for the job?  Drink some grog for some liquid courage.  Just don't drink too much, you have to pass that drunk check!  And for heaven's sake, don't be drunk when the compartment floods or you will surely drown.  

A fast playing cooperative game that has the potential to sink you (pun intended).

I enjoy the tension in this game, but it's not a game that I like playing enough to get it out very often. It's a 6 for now. I'd rather play Ghost Stories.

Okay cooperative game. It's easier than I was hoping, and the game play is less compelling. The time track is a cool idea, but I didn't care for this implementation, probably because I felt like I was just alternating between grabbing random items and fixing something. There weren't enough hard decisions in the game. I'd just rather play a different cooperative game.

This is a cooperative game. They say 3 to 8 players, but it's really simple for two players to just play two characters (gnomes) each. You can even play it alone by taking as many gnomes as you desire (max 8)! It's a cool game.

Replaced the d10 with a more suitable steel-looking one, and have plans to add some paint to the gnomes... that's how much I like it!  I play this solo, just get it out on the table now and then and give it a go; I usually lose but I have fun doing it.

[1 play] This was fun, I could just think of better ways to have fun in a group game. The theme is fun and the game does a good job of implementing the scenario of the doomed sub full of drunken sailors.

The cons are:
- the small board really does diminish the enjoyment
- the iconography isn't good
- the decisions aren't that open to truly imaginative solutions

And finally, I think I'm finding that cooperative games are in a very tricky niche to satisfy to my tastes.

Most recent play 12-20-08 with Brian R, Michael, Corey, Donovan, and Garrett.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Ranks up there in the pantheon of Coop games and one of the more impressive new releases.

Players (2-8!) are gnomes moving around a Russian sub trying to ward off various disasters that have cropped up. The use of 'time' as action points has been shamelessly ripped-off, I mean, borrowed from Jenseits von Theben (Thebes)...but it's used to great effect. Downtime is an issue if you use lots of time and if there are lots of other players (but shouldn't be an issue if you're part of discussions).

There is a nice 'story-like' progression to the game as more and more things happen: fires spread, areas flood, Kraken appears etc. FFG have kept things simple and jammed a lot of stuff into a value-for-money package. They could have easily released this as a $49.95 game but chose to sell it for $24.95. Small fiddly component aside, I'm impressed by the overall substance this game has.

RATING: 6
The game is random and chaotic, but it's still pretty fun.  The theme is unique and works well.  Overall, the game is tricky and winning definitely takes some luck.  Don't take it too seriously and the experience can be enjoyable.

SOLO PLAY:  Since Red November is a cooperative game, then it can also be played solo. To do so, you must control at least 3 gnomes. More gnomes can be used to make the game more difficult, but the game is already quite tricky to beat as it is. This game involves some push-your-luck dice rolling, frantic panic, and a fair amount of randomness. The theme is goofy, but I like it and always have fun playing the game, even if I don't typically win. If you decide to pick this game up and give it a try, good luck saving the sinking "Red November" submarine... You'll definitely need it!

RATING: 6
Starts off slow, and gets more frantic as the game goes on. The last 10 minutes introduce a lot of events, so you want the meters to be pretty low before you get to that point (there isn't enough time by then to really fix much). There is a bit of strategy in what problems you allow to persist, since there is interaction between fire and flooding. The wife enjoys playing it, which is good enough for me.

Steff had one minute to shut down the missile launch or else we were all dead! One minute! That's a lot of pressure! So she drank two bottles of Grog (vodka makes the nerves steady)! Now all she needed was a 7 or less. Wahoo! She made it! She saved us all from terrible doom! 30 seconds later she passed out as she failed her faint check. This game is full of story and thick with theme. I highly recommend this if you have a fun group to roll it out with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
The time keeping and event resolution is quite tedious, and beyond that it just feels like yet another coop game. Randomness also seems to be a bit on the high side; There are phases where you don't know what to do with your time because the ship is fine, and then everything happens at once.

Érdekes, jó ötlet a tengeralattjáró-krízis kooperatív játékra gondolása. A kis tábla és elemek egyrészről jók, mert könnyű szállítani a játékot, de egy kicsit nagyobb és szebb megvalósítás talán növelhette volna a játékélményt. Jó gondolat a játékosok egymás után következésének megvalósítása. Minden játékos fix percet kap, ami alatt megpróbálja a többiek segítségével a tengeralattjárón felmerülő vészhelyzeteket megoldani. Dönt arról hány percet szán egy probléma megoldására, ami alapján mehet biztosra sok időt felhasználva, de ezzel több új krízis merül fel, vagy a szerencsére bízhatja a megoldást, ezzel kevesebb új problémát indít el. Sajnos azonban ezzel előfordulhat, főleg sok játékos esetén, hogy egy játékos akár 20 percet is malmozással tölthet, míg a többi játékos a többi idejét használja, ugyanis, akinek a legtöbb pillanatnyi megmaradt ideje van, mindig az következik. Jó ötlet a részegség megvalósítása is, érdekes a kooperatívságba belevitt egyéni nyeréslehetőség is a játék végén. Nekem egy kicsit hosszú volt a játékidő. Talán, ha fele ennyi lenne még korrekt darabnak is mondanám. Valahogy úgy érzem kevesebb játékosszámmal jobban működhet, bár akkor kevésbé lehet izgalmas. Sajnos nyelvfüggő a játék, pedig a kríziskáryták akár ikonrendszerű megoldást is kaphattak volna. Nagy kooperációra sincs igazából szükség, mindig kb. adott, hogy mely problémát kell a soron levő játékosnak megoldania és a tárgyátadáson kívül nincs más, ami a közös játékot preferálná. Talán jobb lett volna különböző tulajdonsággal rendelkező karakterek megalkotása. Igazából még így sincs nagy gond a játékkal, de valahogy nem éreztem azt, hogy megfogott volna, a kooperatívak közül nem ezt választanám újrajátszásra.
Közben olvasom, hogy épp ebben a hónapban jött ki az új nagyobb verzió, amiben a tárgylapkák is kártyák lettek és a szabályfüzet is rendezettebbre sikerült.

This is a great experience game.  This gives you a sense of impeding doom. It blends group decision making with individual push your luck elements.  It doesn't feel like yet another coop game where you are negotiating with your fellow players to let you try to take the turn the way you want to.

This doesn't just feel like a bunch of abstract mechanics.  While the danger resolution is the same for every different scenario, the ramifications of the dangers are different and their ramifications and interaction feel unique and representative.  You aren't just rolling dice to defeat 4 blue.  

Your decisions also effect your personal game.  You can die heroically, or hysterically.  And if all goes pear shaped, you can bail on the ship if you don't think it is going to make it. 

I can't help but compare this to the parallel release Space Alert.  Where Space Alert is procession and more like a logistic math equation put under a time pressure (where you find out after the test what your grade is) this is all about the story.  

Rating may go up.

A fun little co-op that has a few clever twists to it.  The theme is ripe as well, as zany a theme as it is.  Definitely should have been published in a bigger box, though. *update* - Some of my first-play fears were realized in my second play.  So much randomness!  It still was fun, but the game itself is more of a "collect items, hope you don't lose them to randomness, wait till something bad happens, fix it, die"

Ive played this game once and it was a lot of fun. If you want a fun & simple board game that also has some strategy but its not overkill then this game is perfect. For those new to the board games and euro strategy type games who want to start out slow and not jump to the big games like axis & allies right away then this is the game for you. Its crazy fun about dwarfs on a sub thats being attacked and destroyed and things are going wrong like fire and water leaks and doors being locked and you have to figure out how to get the sub to safety or get out of the sub. But beware, if you get out and the sub makes it to safety, you lose!

Great theme, and they likely have fixed one complaint of everything being too small with the new edition. It's a fun co-op, but just strikes me that it would be a bit redundant after a few plays since there are only a handful of disasters to fight off, and that it's only good for occasional play. Also, I'd play with 3 or 4 players instead of the 6 we had in order to minimize both play and downtime.

RATING: 7.5
A neat little co-operative game, set on a potentially doomed submarine, for those who want a break from 'Pandemic'.  For 3-8 players, but 2 can play fine with 2 gnomish submariners each.  Easiest with only 3 (and the Kraken will rarely appear then), but perhaps too chaotic with 6 or more, IMHO.  A very fun little game, and can be pretty tense at the end.  Feels like a steeper learning curve than 'Pandemic', with more rules and different things going on, but after a few plays you get the hang of it.  Well-produced, and recommended.

I like this so much more than my friends. It can be dull with too many players, waiting an age for your turn, but the turn order mechanic is actually very interesting with fewer players - the selfishness of wanting a turn in the near future starts to affect your decision making, as well as the more obvious aspects of the gameplay.

I also love the tiny board and the (relatively) small box, the gnomes, the artwork, and the idea of beating the Kraken with your bare hands while somewhat merry.

Pandemic meets Thebes. more fun than both. Plays up to 8 but sweet spot is probably 4/5. A sense of humour helps when playing this game. Rules badly drafted and need a play example included not a reference to FF's website. Excellent value for money, nice sized box. Prefer to Pandemic.

One of the better cooperative games I've played. We haven't won yet in three plays, but it is still a lot of fun. The setup is easy, and the gameplay is fast once you get the hang of it. I love the theme of being trapped on a doomed sub, too. The rules make the game seem harder than it is (isn't that often the case?) and, in some instances, situations that do arise aren't addressed. Luckily, you can find out how to deal with these issues on Bruno Faidutti's Red November FAQ. It CAN be played 2 player, and up to 8!

Probably the most fun cooperative game that I've played. With the small encapsulated space and the humour, it reminds me a bit of The Awful Green Things From Outer Space. The newer, larger board seems unnecessary.

Red November is an unpretentious game. It's silly and funny by design, yet provides a good challenge and presents the players with interesting dilemmas. I've not yet one after 3 plays, and that's a good thing in my view. It's not a game I'd play frequently, but it's not one I plan to part with either.

Unique and fun theme, which is important for me personally.  Cooperative, so family-oriented. Crazy and chaotic - randomness may turn off some, but it's kind of the point, here.

This is great, silly, chaotic fun.  The chance for it to turn from co-op to 'stab your buddy' will make it even more fun for some folks.  I've been collecting coops, and I won't say this is my favorite among them, which may keep it from seeing the table as much as it might, but it's not bad, and I'll probably play it again.

Drunk gnomish sailors stumbling around a sub while it falls apart around them...what could be better?!  But seriously, the game lacks the drive at the begining that Pandemic has.  In Pandemic, the world starts already inflamed with diseases making it vital to start curing things.  In this game, the sub is perfectly fine at the begining and only falls apart once the sailors start doing things.  Why not just set the game up...the sub is fine and everyone is alive...we win!

RATING: 6.5
[FFG 2008 edition] {Submarine; cooperative, variable-player-order, dice-rolling; optimal 4-5p} Red November is a new cooperation game from Bruno.  It is fun, engaging, thematic, challenging but it's too long for what it is (it becomes more repetitive at late game).  The rules are confusing and players really need to read the FAQ before playing.  And, I believe it needs one or two games to have all rules correct.  Players have to work as a group to efficiently handle all problems and resources.  Decisions are meaningful in this game: players have to decide which problem to tackle, how long to tackle, etc.  Replayability seems good.  It is quite scalable; yet, it becomes more chaotic with more players.

The components are nicely illustrated.  The game box size is good!  I don't find the small game board annoying.

This is a good try for first-time designer, Jef Gontier.  Keep up the good work!

Another "heard about from Essen" must-have, though it didn't come nearly as strongly recommended as Ghost Stories. I traded away my copy of A Touch of Evil Supernatural Game for enough cash to buy this and No Thanks!, since I was finding more and more that AToE was just not really my speed. After two plays with mostly-new crowds, I'm pretty fond of this little game. The tiny board and pieces do make it feel a bit cramped (though I appreciate the small box!), but it's a fun, chaotic mess of a co-op. It's got some flaws, particularly that a few players felt that there was too much downtime between turns (I personally invest myself in everyone's turns and try to group-problem-solve so I didn't feel this as much) and some rules clarifications that are thankfully on the BGG forums, but for a cheap and small game, I think it's a good buy. Another co-op that avoids the "alpha player" problem by having so much going wrong that there isn't a single right answer; you just have to cross your fingers and dive into a problem and hope you chose the right one.

Nope - not working for me here. I thought at first I was playing the rules wrong, but I've watched the superb instructional video here on BGG, and read through the rules half a dozen times. The theme wears thin fairly quick, and what you end up with feels like an unpolished slightly messy game. I got this at the same time as Pandemic, and it doesn't even come close.

This is a fun cooperative (for the most part) game with a rather humorous theme.  You are all gnomes in a gnomish submarine that is in trouble.  You must prevent the submarine from being destroyed until the rescue ship comes to rescue you.  Compartments can flood, fires can start and a kraken can attack the sub.  There are various tools that help you deal with these situations and then there's grog which gives a universal bonus to anything you try to do.

Másik gond még vele, hogy nincs annyira égető szükség az együttműködésre, mint a Pandemic-ben, így sok a holtidő, amíg újra sorra kerülsz. A játékosok folyton feláltak, és elsétálgattak az asztaltól, amikor nem rajtuk volt a sor.

Played this solo, using three of the gnomes.  It mostly makes sense (though I can see how a fire in room 10 might just stay there...what's the motivation for putting it out?).  I enjoyed it as a learning experience, but it would definitely be more fun with other people...even lots of other people.  Maybe not much interaction on the board (multi-player solitaire with a common goal), but plenty of room for table talk.

It's a cute and funny co-op that truly requires co-operation or everyone is sunk.  It can also be pretty exciting when survival depends on a roll with the odds stacked against you.

It gives off a similar vibe as Galaxy Trucker.  Both are like party games for gamers.  Strategy takes a backseat -- instead, just laugh and scramble as the bad luck piles on.

(My friend's got the right idea.  Play this with shot glasses and a bottle of vodka.  Your gnome has a grog, you have a grog.)

This could have been about submarines, but no, they had to throw gnomes into the mix.  Genius!

Scales well, and too gripping to worry about player downtime even with large groups.  A little bit of manageable luck adds a lot of spice to the game, as you weigh your chances and hoot for joy when things go well at the last minute.  As for those moments when you botch what should have been a slam dunk and your oxygen runs out, well, it plays fast and sets up fast, too.  A great game for the end of a game night -- under an hour and leaves 'em laughing.

RATING: 9
Despite an incredibly frustrating rulebook, once you figure out the inner workings of the game it's a riot. Enormously fun game of Murphy's law.

The time mechanic is wildly original, although some major tweaks are necessary at times. It's also refreshing to see a game where the players work together against a strong game mechanic rather than competing. This game is enormously fun to dramatise and filled with memorable moments.

I highly reccomend you tweak the rules, though, here are some of my suggestions.

My House Rules
----------
We felt that the game was tough enough without certain situations of instant death (which often didn't make chronological sense) so we made some fixes.

-If you are in a room that has been flooded ('high flood') you may use the aqualung to open a hatch rather than dying.

-If you faint with timed events active, you may place your counter beyond those events, rather than losing instantly. If the other players manage to disarm the timed events, you wake up normally.

The rules make no mention of this, but we thought it makes sense to be able to 'trade' with a fainted player (assuming the player actually agrees with it)

I really enjoyed the hectic pace of this game, with fires and floods starting at the worst possible places.  I do wish it was produced as a full size game though, as the bits are fiddly.  Using the tiny score markers, it was hard not to bump them, or the little board around them.

Ever dreamed of almost dying or actually dying in a malfunctioning submarine? This game is for you!

Red November is a great combination of strategy and luck. You must prevent your submarine from breaking down for a certain period of time while your rescuers come. One my main issues with this game is that there are so many ways to lose, including:

Kraken attack
Everybody dying due to fire/flooding
Lack of Oxygen
Too much pressure
Overheating
Accidental Missile launch

And all the while, you're being hindered by floods, fires, and lacked doors. It gets quite hectic.

Just OK.  The mechanics are clever enough (although not groundbreaking by any means), but I just don't like the prospect of really early player elimination in a coop game.  I don't hate player elimination in general, but it doesn't work for me in this context -- I'd rather everyone lives or dies together as in Pandemic or at least have the eliminations come toward the end as in Lord of the Rings.

The idea of drunk gnomes attempting to halt the inevitable combustion of their rickety submarine is hilariously appealing. I like the option to abondon your mates to their doom by abandoning ship with the aqualung. Seemed to lose appeal once the game had been won.

RATING: 4
Chaotic coop game.  My first and only play so far was e with seven which probably detracted from my experience.  I think I would think its okay with fewer, but the  downtine was pretty severe.  

It is tough to formulate any sense of strategy in this game, after 1  play.  We were constantly just reacting to the events and never had a big picture approach.

If it could move at a quicker pace, I would investigate to see how much depth there is, or if winning and losing depends on the order of the cards coming up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First off I'm going to say that I have no problem at all with the randomness in this game. I am after all a big Faidutti fan so you know going into one of his games that randomness, wackiness and frivolity are all par for the course.

So the game is just that. VERY random. That I'll take. Incorporating the time track element from Thebes is awesome in a co-op game bravo there. 

I've played the game twice in one evening. First game lost miserably. Second game won without much trouble. I do attest the 2nd game kind of seems like a fluke and we got lucky with events. That's random for you and again...I don't care.My main criticism here is I got bored doing the exact same things over and over. Yes that's what you do in Pandemic too but something there feels...more fun. Maybe it's in those special cards you pull and Red November doesn't have that.

I plan on putting more thoughts down later but that'll come out in a review so look for that...maybe.

Oh, and I had to get rid of the insert in order to close the box nicely. That bit of printing didn't need to be done. 

UPDATE: I've played the game quite a few more times now and am happy with the 6 rating as I don't see a 6 as a BAD game. It's ok and it's not something I want to play often but have some fun playing from time to time. Still deserved a bigger  box.

A fun game!

I have the newer version from Fantasy Flight, so the size of the board isn't a issue.

I like the game, just no all that much. The "funny" of it wears off though not as fast as I expected. The game it's not fast, but doesn't go as far as to be a long one.

The art work is good and the feel of a sinking sub is there, which is great. Overall, a solid game, but with a faster and less fiddle gameplay, it could be better.

Red November is a cooperative game in a gnomish attack submarine where everything is going wrong. The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there’s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.

RATING: 8.5
First game: Just about made it out alive in 2P, each playing 2 gnomes. Huge fun, nicely complex but not so it gets in the way of gameplay but very much adds to it. Theme and flavour spot on. The time track and ghost takes a couple of turns to get used to but really no more. After that it makes perfect sense. However, like in GhostStories, things can go from ok to cataclysmic pretty quickly so watch out!

The only down side for me is that even though we have the 'square box' revised edition, the board feels like it could have still been bigger. The timing track can get pretty crowded and it would be nice to have a little card store for the Grog in the Captain's cabin, and they could have fitted more of the brilliantly themed artwork on then, giving it all a little more space to breathe (no pun), but genuinely, a fantastic game.

Not bad, but a little bland. In games like Pandemic and Ghost Stories, it is possible to assess the risk level at any time and estimate how good your chances are for the next few rounds. Also you quite often make little decisions regarding the target locations of threats and whether or not to prepare yourself for specific events. In short: You can try to plan ahead. In Red November this is almost impossible, because (a) it is possible to draw A LOT of bad events during a single turn, (b) dice more often than not determine the area of the ship hit by a bad event and (c) the succes of taking an action to get better equipment is largely dependent on how lucky you are drawing tiles. Theme and artwork almost make up for this though.

Wow, a really terrible cooperative game. I can be persuaded to play it but the rules are so patchwork and so many gaping holes. Just check out the faq. There are so many unanswered questions in the rule book. The only way this happens is if the game wasn't properly play tested. I am a little surprised and shocked that they would market this game with so many questions still unanswered. While the game is thematic, the rules were built around the theme without too much thought. Will play again, but unlikely to enjoy it any much more.

I find the spending of time to be an interesting element, but a little bit fiddly. You can ultimately kinda bum rush the ending with this mechanic, though, as we discovered.

A fine but not outstanding fast cooperative game, which puts it in the same company as [gameid=30549].  It's easy to teach and easy to learn, and it does have a great, light feel to it.  The price point and box size are also appealing.  Still, I have cooperative games I would rather play, so this one is going to fall by the wayside for the most part.  This is in an awkward position of longer than real filler, and shorter than a satisfying game.  The cards will sometimes absolutely screw you, and sometimes you will coast through a game with relatively little difficulty.  A very average game.

At first glance, this game appears to be agonizingly tight.  If you're into cooperative games that continue putting trial after trial in your path, so much so that when you finally stop to take a breath, everything falls to hell all over again, then this is your game.  This is a resource management game taken to the point where the board is what you're managing, come hell or high water.  Literally.  Unfortunately, the fewer the people there are in the game, the easier it becomes, since the players and the number of things they choose to do dictate how difficult the game is.  It seems to be more mechanical, dry, and luck-driven than other cooperative games, but at least there are folks who are still interested in playing it.

Interesting coop game. Has some chances for traitor (usually no one will be the traitor BUT because there is that chance no one will easily share the information about their gear which will benefit the gameplay since no one can boss anyone around which can be really annoying and stupid in cooperative games.

One fault to this game is that it can easily feel like players had no real chance of winning and the game was decided (by luck) even before it started. This element might annoy others.

Vodka swilling gnomes trapped aboard a sinking submarine. It's a pretty good effort and the time mechanism adds an interesting twist to the game's decision tree.

RATING: 6
General zaniness and some really clever bits make this a really fun little co-op.  Lots of randomness, but that's par for the course for Faidutti.

The way that fires and flooding works is especially cool.  A room can be dry or have high or low water.  Open a high water room from a dry room and both now have low water.  This can be used strategically to put out fires (which can only exist in dry rooms).  But, water slows down movement and high water can be lethal, so you can't just let the place flood to keep the water at bay.  I really like this aspect.

There is also a drunkenness mechanic that is a lot of fun--drink grog to get a one-time boost and/or charge through fire, but risk passing out down the road.  I just wish there were more ways to sober up to make this aspect a little more dynamic (there's one coffee card in the whole game).

One big beef I have is with the iconography, which I think is poorly done.  I'm a big fan of using icons in games--when used well, they convey information more quickly, concisely, and accurately than text.  Unfortunately, the icons in Red November are counterintuitive and not universally applied.

There are three tracks that must be managed, "asphyxiation", "heat", and "pressure".  These are each associated with a different symbol: a pressure gauge for asphyxiation, a bolt for heat, and a gear for pressure.  The potential for confusion is obvious.

The good news is that these icons are used on the board to indicate where you can lower these tracks, and on item cards to indicate which items help with these actions.  The bad news is, they aren't used on the event cards that often have you manipulating these tracks.  The inexcusably stupid news is that some of the event cards that have you twiddling the pressure track have a picture of a pressure gauge that looks almost exactly like the asphyxiation track symbol.

It's a decent co-op game.  The betting mechanic seemed like it was a good idea, but when we played it last we just always bet 10 min and you would automatically win the event.  Plus, it always seemed that the disasters weren't that bad.  I have other co-op games that I would play over this one but we will see what happens.

The game really needs unique player abilities to become a decent coop. I liked the push-your-luck mechanism, but then it became boring, and it's always so dissapointing when you overshoot it. Also the ending with just time running out is not very epic. The game is also either too easy, or it sometimes randomly creates impossible scenarios.

I think I enjoy Pandemic better as a co-op.  This game feels like (and what I get the impression from the designer) it wants to be a competitive game.  It is enjoyable, and it is very very challenging.  When compared to Pandemic, it seems to be lacking a build up curve.  You just start off screwed and by the end you are very screwed.  Pandemic has this ebb and flow to the diseases that I never paid attention to, but is very apparent to me that is lacking in this game.

Although, Pandemic is missing drunk gnomes in a submarine being attacked by a kraken.  I don't know how that got left out!

This game is brutal but in a good way.  The game is very easy to learn and play.  It is also not a long game which is nice if you want something that is simple and quick.

Though we like it because all the tension and action going on makes you sit on the edge of your seat.

A cooperative game with a much-appreciated sense of humor: frantic gnome activity, grog-driven periods of unconsciousness, the dreaded kraken, etc.  The event deck burns quickly and furiously, and an unlucky series of mishaps can lead to cruel and unusual player elimination, which ratchets up the tension and hilarity quite a bit.

Yes, there are tons of die rolls, but in this case the die-driven chaos is perfectly at home in a game as silly as this one.  

I look forward to playing again.

[i]Update:[/i]

I spoke too soon!  After another play (six years after the last one), Red November is clearly too long and too repetitive.  We had to pack in our last game due to a lack of time, and no one minded.  That's not a good sign.

It wants to be 45 minutes long, but it just isn't.  Rating might decrease with more plays...

One more time a game with not very well written rules (in french), but it is always fun to play it. You will panic each time something starts to go wrong and to see your teammates not to be able to solve the problems at hands. Then they will try to use tools or vodka as a bonus to help them, finally failing miserably because their character is too drunk to act ;) . You also have the possibility to see one of your teammates betraying you at the last moment, but he has to be sure that the rest of the crew die, because if they survive, he is the one who will lose.. :)

A very fiddly co-operative game of fire-fighting on a submarine. I quite like co-ops from time to time but they need to spark some discussion or collaboration. It wasn't awful, but neither was it particularly enthralling and the decisions weren't taxing. The time track is reimplemented from Jenseits von Theben and is a clever way to restrict actions. However, here it can lead to some strange situations. 

Red November makes no attempt to address the co-op problem of one player directing the others (hidden items are no help), so you could just play solo. The board is tiny and although it has a time track around its edge, you have to keep the markers off the track in order to see information on when events are going to occur. It could have used a bit more physical design work to make play smoother. I don't know whether the larger reprint is better, and I'm probably not going to find out as the game didn't appeal to me enough to want to play it again. It works as a game but it took too long to play for something so simple. Our play took 90 minutes; the box says 1-2 hours - I could play much deeper, more rewarding games in that time. And FFG do their usual best to make the game more complicated than it is with an overly long rulebook. The theme is borderline distasteful, the gnome art grotesque. It can accommodate lots of players, so I guess it's got that going for it, but I dread to think of the downtime.

Fun co-op in your typical "race against the clock" scenario. I love the first edition even though it has a terrible rulebook because it's portable.

RATING: 7.4
Like it. Control chaos with style. Like a lot of the neat mechanics. Turn order and the water stick out the most. Might turn down a game to play something I haven't played or a few other higher rated games. But overall fun little work together game.

I'd play this again as the game wasn't bad, with a very entertaining theme. However the components were simply WAY too small. In FFG's haste to make it into a Silver Line game, they should have considered that a slightly larger game with bigger components would improve the game.

I'd have bought this in a second if the box and components were equivalent in size to Pandemic.

Ended up getting this for free as my BGG.con 09 game. Played it again and like it much more.

I really wanted this game to be great.  I thought the concept was amusing and I like co-op games.  I think the problem might have been the funky turn order.  It seemed like a good idea basing it on time but if you get some bad rolls and have to redo actions then you may be sitting on the sidelines for a long time waiting for everyone to catch up.

Another co-op game I can barely win- but enjoy losing. A lot of options here, and a lot of choices, but everything is clear & obvious. I just haven't learned to optimise my actions yet.

There's alot going on, yet the choices aren't all that interesting. Also, if the number one knock on cooperative games is that one or two players can take control and tell everyone else what to do... this game is the worst offender of the lot. In fact, when we played a six-player game, four of the other players quickly stopped paying attention and *asked* us to do their moves for them. Fun!

Rules were garbage. I don't understand how anyone could get a decent play out of it as we stumbled from the start. Important things are buried in random sections while some explanations are just plain started and not finished. There were so many problems with the rules that the game was hard to enjoy.

The gameplay itself is a bit too simple for me and I feel like there are some better co-ops out there. The second revision will hopefully clear things up.

I would play the new edition at least once and expect my rating to go up as long as the rules were clear. I bet it's a little better with more people too.

This is a kind of silly, kind of fun co-operative game. dice and cards and tiles.  Lots of random challenges.  It plays from 3-8.  The more players you have, the more challenging it is, but also the more downtime.  So there is kind of a trade off.  It has a time commitment that increases with the number of gnomes playing.  On the other hand, it can be kind of a fun solitare time filler as well.

It's not a bad game, but with Pandemic and Dead of Winter (co-ops) in my collection, don't see me bringing this to the table.

After our first play, I asked my wife what she thought and she said it was one of those games where it makes you go "Oh [enter your expletive of choice]!" Don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but we both enjoyed the game and would be willing to try again.

The box size in my book is a plus; however, the small time track is an issue. It is impossible to see through the markers on the track to determine if an event occurs. It would have been better if the stars were actually above the track. We took to playing with our markers around the edge off the side of the board.

Sure, there are some illogical things that occur, such as a gnome being able to extinguish a fire before the event actually happens for them. But, hey its a game. Suspend your beliefs rooted in logic and have some fun. And don't forget the grog!

We had a bunch of rules questions on our first run through... but our second was much smoother and more fun.  I do find it to drag a bit and get repetitive in places, but when time is short and your gnomes have a long flooded way to go every die roll is tense and fun.  I do really like how the timing track works as a game mechanic.

I have yet to play a co-op game that I didn't like.  This one is as good as the rest of them.  It is fairly fast, frantic, and extremely fun.

The game is also pretty tough, and since it does use dice rolls to determine results, you could lose due to just poor luck.  For many that could be a big downside, thankfully I love leaving fate to chance in games.

Such a long and ponderous game to play through, especially with a full complement of 8 people.  The sheer amount of down time, discussion, moves to count and bits to fiddle with around a tiny board is actually quite maddening.  I don't expect cooperative games to go very fast, but definitely not this slow either.  I think Red November suffers from the case of too much for what it has to offer.  Unnecessarily complicated for its own good.

Not a _bad_ game per se, just a mediocre one. It's really bare-bones for a co-op game. There's not much going on here, just a bit of dice-rolling. The time calculation can cause you to be passed over in turn order for several turns, as well, so some players may sleep through the game while others roll nonstop. Overall, it is right at home in a small box because by no stretch of the imagination is there enough gameplay here to justify a large one.

This has to be the worst stinking rulebook for constant page flipping, backwards and forwards, that I have ever had the misfortune to have to sit through. FFG also included the occasional section of contradictory rulings which totally messes the game up.

Comparable to Pandemic, and Forbidden Island, although this game is a lot clunkier.

Co-operative games are not really my thing. Although i am happy to play Lord of the Rings, or Shadows over Camelot - however , I think this is the most boring co-operative game I have played. And if someone in the group knows it well, you may as well leave them to play the whole game while you watch !

Of the co-op games I've played, this one feels the most chaotic while having the most fascinating theme. The artwork is great and the game fun to play and watch develop. Mechanics are decent as well. The game really is tiny and could have benefitted from slightly larger components (though I do love how much space it takes up on the shelf).

I don't usually like co-op games, but the exception is Red November.  This has a great wacky theme, simple rules and enough good player choices.  To me it also seems like it successfully minimizes one player bossing the rest around (which tends to happen in my group in co-op games) .

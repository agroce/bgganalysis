[First impressions]
Many, many aspects are crammed around a simple (at its core) system, giving it much detail and an ample variety of options during each turn. However, I must also say that my first experience with this game has been far from great. 
Hannibal seems to be simply too long for the amount of luck it brings into play. Having the luck of the draw to influence an hour long game is one thing, but when we shift gear to a 4 hour title it's a completely different matter. I'm sure that playing time can be reduced with repeated play, but even getting to the advertised 150 minutes can't change the nature of the problem. The huge swings of luck can put you back on game after a false start, but they also ruin your plans in a way that doesn't really fit with our idea of "inevitable unknown factors that can influence a war".
The battle system is just a match of risk taking while you try to exploit the limits of your rival's hand of cards. The problem is that it hardly feels like a battle: only a couple of cards have some kind of effect on the battle itself and its consequences, the other cards could easily show a number instead of a battle manoeuvre. Just a row of text would have sufficed: some kind of modifier on the following rounds or other ways to react to the cards of your rival, instead of ending up losing a battle with a huge advantage of cards because you didn't have *that* card. Is this supposed to simulate those desperate battles with unpredictable outcomes? Ok, but I'd really like to have a part in that, instead of thanking (or blaming) my luck.
After all we're talking about a game that has two tables for casualties calculation, and at least a couple of exceptions on almost every rule. I can understand that many of those exceptions and design choices have their justification, along with the occasional historical flavour, but the gap between that and the combat system is considerable. 
Going back to the rulebook after the game made me notice how much space is taken by rules that come into play just once in the game, at most. On the other hand, you have three different retreat rules concerning cities, that hardly compare with the couple of simple paragraphs about political influence, one of the main paths to victory.
I also find difficult to define this game as being "easy to learn". I'm perfectly aware that there are lots of wargames out there that would make this rulebook look like a leaflet, but there are still lots of rules in there, without an index and not always well organized. Add the time needed to learn how to play this game properly to the already long playing time and you end up with an experience that, I'm afraid, is not my cup of tea.
It's a game that mixes brilliant design choices to a few annoying shortcomings. I can see how it can occasionally really shine, but I'm afraid it's not worth the time investment on the way to that "big, perfect play". Of course, I'll give it another try, but so far I'm more impressed by the design than by the game itself.

Very good game.  It's a bit hard to know what to do on your first playing and there are lots of rules to learn.  Valley Games did a nice job and everything is well made.  I'm looking forward to more games but the time of 150 minutes I think is not long enough.  If you play all the turns I think a time of 4 hours at least.

Just the right amount of action versus bookkeeping to keep you interested for the whole game. 

The only mechanic I wasn't very fond of was the battle system. Somehow I felt it lacked depth in all levels of strategy and tactics. Luckily this wasn't the case with the game, just with the battle system only.

This is one of those games whose legend precedes it.  It's postion as a wargaming super-star is almost akin to that of Hannibal himself in generalship.  What I've discovered over the dozen plays I've had so far, is that this reputation is justified, for this is a game worthy of endless replaying and which is full of huge subtleties and depths.  And yet somehow the rules, though long at the first read, click together pretty nicely and the whole thing seems constantly very rational.  Of course, the War covered is one of the most famous in history and I must say that the designers got it about right in their interpretation.  

I particularly like the way the card system can be used to do so many things and that it is much harder to move as well as fight with certain generals.  The naval rules are simple but elegant and the battle cards keep you on the edge of your seat. So far, I have detected a slight advantage to the Carthiginian player, but there are those who say the opposite...so what do I, a mere beginner know?  I look forward to playing this game scores of times! My fourth play moved this up from a 9.5 to a 10 and I haven't looked back on that since. A great game, but I know it's costly to obtain these days.  The forthcoming reprint will bring a whole new army of fans to this gem of a game.  If you have any interest in wargaming, if I were you, I'd grab it.

I've played this game several times now and it offers a nice simulation of the second Punic war, without being overly complicated to play. The dice make the game a bit luck dependent and there is a rather thin line for both factions in regard to how much bad luck you can take before it becomes evident that you have lost the game. In most of the games I have played, we ended it at turn 6, when Scipio Africanus entered play, as it at that point was very clear which side was winning.

A very nice reprint of a game I've been after for some time. 

I've now started three games, but I haven't yet finished one. My play style and that of my opponent seems to lead to a rather static set of territories. This style of play probably leads to roman victories, but I don't yet know for sure. Looking forward to playing a full game!

A timeless Classic and outstanding GREAT GAME!

Has all that is needed to simulate this epic period: Elephants, Syracuse, Politics, Consular elections, Diplomacy, Legions, Treachery, Navy, Campaigns to cut the breath, cunning battle tactics, Plagues, Alps, Gauls and ... much, much more.
As the second CDG (after We the People), Hannibal RvC has far exceeded its predecessor.
For me, is the best CDG game that combines the wonderful historical flavour with replaybility in a very clean and simple way.
A constant presence in our gaming tables; we never get tired of play it.

The first 5-10 games I played, I lost and put it down to bad luck - I didn't get the battle cards I wanted, the die rolls went against me, I had a poor strategy card hand, etc etc. It was incredibly frustrating, and several times I thought "this is the last time I ever play this game".
I persevered, and after a few games I realised that the game is much about not putting your armies and your strategic/political position in situations where it comes down to luck.

Just played a game of this and I was hooked.  So many decision each turn and you have to play the cards to maximize their effect.  Eventhough we only play for 4 turns, I already got an impression that this one will be a classic.  Too bad I didn't get a copy when it first came out.  Last of the great design from Avalon Hill.  Finally reprinted by Valley Games.  Got my copy 11/05/07.
Unfortunatley the pre-order figures were mailed in their original box and most arrived broken.

This is a case of good intention but poor execution by Valley Game.  Padding?

Hannibal has its good points: while the rules are at my limit in terms of length, they are easily assimilated.  I found the interaction of war and politics quite cleverly done, particularly the draining away of political support after a military defeat. The asymmetry of the two sides is interesting; the Carthaginians with a great leader and lots of good political cards, but short of men and handicapped by Roman control of the seas; the Romans with a really mixed bunch of leaders, but endless reserves of men.  I even like the tension that the maligned battle cards bring.

The Valley Games edition is handsome, though - and here the criticisms start - I find the board artwork rather cluttered and lacking in functionality.  It took a long, hard look to spot the dotted straits of Messana. The borders of Italian provinces could also have been clearer.  

However, my main difficulty lies with the limited strategic options open to Carthage.  A Fortress Spain and North Africa strategy might work, but would be very boring.  Sending Hannibal over the Alps is much more fun but very risky if the Roman has the sense to throw everything at him. In addition, Hannibal's implementation of area control feels crude and dull compared to what euros have made of the genre.

This is a good game, I have played it a few times though and do not really think it is for me. It is difficult to put into words, but I find the game quite depressing :(  You constantly seem to be fighting to survive.  The cards you get drawn are complete luck and very much drive you to a strategy, you don't really have much choice.  Interestingly you could possibly raise the same criticism against Commands and colors ancients which is my favourite game. It is a very subtle difference, and i think very much down to personal taste. This is a good game but not for everyone
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For the second Card-Driven Wargame - and regarded as a classic - this must be a great game, but now I am acquainted with many other CDWs I have mixed feelings.

It is still a very decent game from many respects, but there was room for improvement. I realize this isn't easy to achieve for Valley Games, since you'll have a different game then. Reissuing is the easier way and I am grateful for that.
 
The battle system is a nice attempt but doesn't give you a battle feeling. Dice rolling would have saved time. Furthermore the game swings back and forth too much. Both the Romans and Carthaginians - with the right cards - can land almost anywhere.

The game doesn't force or encourage Hannibal to cross the Alps and bring destruction to Italy. You can use him to defend Spain and wait for opportunities to come in the end game. More scripting was desired by me.

At last this game doesn't reward courage. You can win by going the safe way - one province more than your opponent - instead of the total victory as it historically was.

This game suffers from very complex game rules; there appears to be an exception for everything thus making this game very difficult to learn without constantly referring to the manual. 
The combat phase is actually quite simple but at the same time quite boring, strategy is very limited and ultimately all comes down to mechanically play card after waiting for your opponent to fail playing the same card as you, The opportunity for counter attack is interesting but the combat system is just tedious...

An excellent, and relatively simple, introduction to card-driven wargaming.  What sets it apart from other games of its type (other than We the People) is the way combat is resolved.  The card-based combat mechanic works in this game but can be problematic.  Shuffling and drawing cards for a blowout (Hannibal attacks small roman garrison) is a waste of time.  But the combat system does allow for some interesting situations and outcomes that can't be found using a standard dice-based CRT.

Hannibal se révèle comme étant à la hauteur de sa réputation. Des règles relativement peu compliquées, mais subtiles. Une situation plutôt équilibrée où chaque camp a de nombreuses opportunités. Le seul petit point qui m'interpelle reste la résolution des combats qui fait plus penser à un système de jeu de société qu'à un système de wargame. Mais c'est sans doute ce qui fait que ce jeu est autant apprécié par tous les publics !

I have two issues that prevent me from rating this game an 8 or possibly a 9.

1. The length of time this game requires may be a bit much for me these days.

2. For such an investment of time and energy that H:RvC requires, the luck of the cards is sort of a bummer. Normally I greatly enjoy his very element 0f luck, especially through things like event cards, but I'm not as sure given the commitment this game requires. 

These issues aside - brilliant game. More plays will solidify and likely increase my rating,

A great two player wargame.  The two sides are asymmetric and play differently.  The event cards make each game fresh and challenge you to spot opportunities in each hand.  And the game does a great job of building a unique narrative.

The drawbacks are that the rules are poorly designed, and that while most cases are covered, occasionally you can run into a unique problem that the rules are confusing or just ambiguous about.  And while it's far from a luck driven game, there can be wild swings of luck in card draws or critical rolls.

For both of those reasons, I try to play the game a little less competitively.  And that works, because the narrative nature of this game and the opportunities presented in each new hand of cards keeps things enjoyable even when you are losing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The good: very interesting theme, very good "combat" mechanics, a lot of small decisions that pile up to be a strategy.
The bad: very long, many parts, pretty difficult to "save status" (although I did it once and it did work)

Bottom line: highly recommended for people who are into long war games.

Hrm, down goes another sacred cow for me.  I've only played the VG production, which I found excellent despite my common pre-order issues.  Very clear and legible rulebook, nice art, etc.  I heard that the areas used to be denoted on the cards in the old version, which I'd prefer just to not have to ask where ZZZ is or stare in its general direction and blow my hand in the process due to inexperience.  The rules are fine and not too heavy, just a lot of modifiers.  The consul/proconsul stuff took away more than it added IMO.  I didn't mind and possibly even liked the battle card system, to modest surprise.  My biggest issue is that I felt it was an overwrought game of reversi.  Any game can be distilled and belittled like that, but in this case I don't think the abstractions on top of it did anything to further the case of the game.  It just felt like the game got in the way of our flipping counters from one side to the other.  Just to give an example, I'm not the biggest fan of Twilight Struggle but I don't feel that way about its control changes which are remarkably similar - call that stronger success of its theme and implementation, at least for my tastes.

Rating based on first impressions. Having played the muliplayer "Succesors" I found this pretty easy rules/concept wise..but it's a lot tougher to do well without having a clear strategy from the outset and it's only 2 player. Will definately play further games.

Seems a bit more scripted than other games using this system and Romans somewhat hampered by a variety of restrictions.

RATING: 9
Excellent game, great atmosphere, great graphics. The card based battles are a fine break from odds tables and give one the feeling of having some control over one's armies and having decisions to make beyond rolling dice. Rome has a slight advantage in the game, but both sides are a blast to play with different strategies for each. A classic.

Occasionally excessive card luck prevents it from being a 10.

The Romans, in particular, can sometimes get hosed by bad luck. For instance, it is possible to be dealt a devastatingly bad hand of stratagy cards that make it virtually impossible to do anything for a turn (while your opponent can operate with virtual impunity). Perhaps a greater abundance of 2 or 3 value cards, or greater flexibility in use was in order. Or home cards such as in the GMT multiplayer CDG's.

Extremely good game. One or two rules wackinesses that I'm not perfectly sold on, but other than that it's extremely thematic and strategic. 

It feels like it's somewhere in between a hex wargame and twilight struggle. That's a good thing.

The bad thing is, one bad hand can ruin your game - there needs to be SOMETHING you can do with oppositely colored cards besides just discarding them.

-----

Just looked at my old review... it's entirely possible that when I first played this a couple of years ago, we didn't understand the rules entirely. Just had a second game last night (for which I had to relearn the rules because ID didn't remember them) there are, in fact, ways to spend your cards without them being your color.

Végre kipróbálhattam a kártyavezérelt műfaj egyik úttörőjét! HATALMAS ÉLMÉNY VOLT! (Megjegyzés: ez volt a 400-dik játék, amit próbáltam, jó kis jubileum volt:)) Bár nem teljesen ugyanaz az alapmechanizmus, mint a TS-ben és az 1960-ban, vannak elemek, amik ott is visszaköszönnek. Röviden összehasonlítva: a három közül ez a legfajsúlyosabb darab szerintem, és talán a legjobb is?!

Kezdjük a legegyszerűbb és legvitathatatlanabb szemponttal: a játék gyönyörű! A puzzle-szerűen összerakott tábla, a vezetők, a jelölők... a szebb fajta wargame-ek közé sorolják a játékot. (Wargame-ek körében  elég nagy a szórás ezen a téren...)
A szabály bonyolultsága elviselhető, viszonylag gyorsan elmondható, főleg ha valaki játszott már más kártyavezérelttel. A kártyák nyelvfüggőek, kb. annyira, mint az összes többi kártyavezéreltben. Ami hátrány: 6 óra tisztán:)

De elszalad a 6 óra, mert a játék nagy élmény tényleg. Forulatos, teljesen átélhető. Az első 2-3 körben még nem láttam át teljesen, és ekkor úgy is éreztem, hogy tuti kikapok a punokkal. Szegény Hannibál Kr. e. 216 körül meghalt. Teljesen vesztésre álltam. Utána a Hasdrubal nevű vezetőm megtáltosodott, és kb. 15 ellenséges egységet likvidált, megölte Scipio Africanust is. A két legfontosabb személy amint játékba került, meghalt. Az 5-6. körtől kezdtem úgy érezni, hogy van esélyem (a döntetlen már karthagói győzelmet jelent). Sokáig 10-8 volt a területek aránya a javamra, majd 9-9-on stabilizálódott az arány. De a 8. menetben váratlanul partra szálltak a rómaiak Afrikában, és két hazai tartományomat befoglaltak. Vége szakadt a nyerő szériának, és pont akkor kerültem hátrányba, amikor már csak 1 év volt hátra. Ekkor mindent egy lapra tettem fel, és nekimentem Rómának (ha elfoglalom a várost, azonnal nyerek), de nem jött be, és végül nyert Róma.
Nem szoktam ilyen részletesen leírni egy konkrét partit (önálló blogban szokás ilyesmit), de szerintem jól érzékelteti, hogy mennyire életszerű, mennyire megfordítható a veszettnek hitt parti, és ami így leírva nehezen adható vissza: végig van egy hangulata, és ami fontos, egy lassan változó íve. Majdhogynem egy utólag elmesélhető sztori az egész. Ez a TS-ben pl. nincs meg. Ott ezernyi felé dobáljuk fel a lapkákat, puccsolgatunk jobbra-balra, túlságosan a kártyák alakítják a játék menetét. Itt nem érzem azt, hogy annyira rátelepszenek a kártyák a játékra: alakítják a taktikánkat, de mégis kialakulhat egy vezérfonal. Egyébként nem érzem hogy durván erős kártyák lennének, és egy kártya átlagban 2-3-szor játékba kerül, tehát elég jól kiegyenlítődnek az esélyek. 
A kocka helyett külön kártyapaklival vívjuk meg a csatát, nekem ez nagyon tetszik, mint megtudtam, a lassúsága miatt hagyták ki a későbbi hasonló játékokból ezt a mechanizmust. A valósághűség kedvéért játékba kerülő proconsulok is ötletesek.

10 oldalt is tudnék írni, de kár tovább ragozni: az egyik legjobb játék, amit eddig próbáltam. Nem az a fajta, ami után felugrik az ember, hogy "na de király volt, jöhet egy visszavágó?", hanem olyan, aminek hatása alatt vagyok, de órák óta nem tudom összeszedni rendesen, hogy miért:)  
És bár kicsit kapkodóan játszottam, de ezzel együtt azt érzem, hogy akár sakk mélységű pozíciós harc is kialakulhat két tapasztalt játékos között. Nyerő stratégia? Ugyan már:)
---
Módosítom a véleményemet annyiban, hogy vannak durván erős kártyák a játékban, és ebből fakadóan elég fontos a kártyák ismerete. Új játékossal javasolt végigmenni a 64 stratégiai kártyán játék előtt, mert néhány területet ezek ismeretében fokozottan érdemes védeni. Emellett fontos a hadvezérek képességeivel nagyon tisztán lenni, nagyon nem mindegy, hogy melyik a jó hajós, a jó védekező, jó támadó, jó ostromló, stb... Ez a rész nagyon nagy változatosságot visz a játékba.
A második partim vége nagyon fordulatos volt. Alapesetben összesen 144 lap kerül kijátszásra egy játék során, a mi játékunkban a 142. lap után Karthagó állt nyerésre 9-9-el, a 143. lap után Róma javára módosult az állás 8-9-re, a 144. lap után pedig újra Karthagó volt a nyerő 9-8-ra, ezzel meg is nyerte a játékot...

One of the good wargames I've played.Exceptional battle system that captures the uncertainty,the balance of forces,and other aspects of battle with a rather simple but on-the-spot mechanism!I like the retreat rules also.The board is exquisite,I like the puzzle lock production,but I have two observations.The provinces should be depicted with slightly variant colours so they are more distinguishable,and the board should have a provinces track for easy keeping of political influence differences.Gameplay-wise,I love the balancing mechanisms (e.g. winter attrition) but I still do not find the game crystal perfect.Clearly preferrable to Twilight Struggle.

Initial Impression: This is more than just a wargame. The military aspects are balanced with a need to watch the political scene. The card driven battles make for an interesting subgame which give the underdog of a given battle the remotest sense of hope.

The CDG comes of age as the rough edges of We The People are honed into a truly brilliant game.

Unlike most CDG's it works as a simulation as well, you can take Hannibal's historical path or you can forge new methods of attacking Rome.

(Some player's have attacked the card battle mechanism.  It's not supposed to be a simulation any more than dice rolling is, just a different method of resolving battle outomes and, unlike the We the People card deck, it works quite well.)

I have no interest in Ancient combat so I wanted to try out Hannibal more for it being a CDG than from any historical perspective.  Unfortunately, I find Twilight Struggle to be more compelling in gameplay & theme, so I have no interest in playing Hannibal again.

On a positive note, I enjoyed the Battlecard combat with the matching Flank cards and the various special powers for Generals & elephants.  On a negative note, I disliked the strategy cards.  I found them seriously boring compared to the newer CDG games available.  The funny thing is that the strategy cards reminded me of the Commands & Colors system more than the battle cards.  I'm not a fan of the C&C system and those games take less than an hour, whereas Hannibal can take 2+ hours!

Awesome historical simulation of the second Punic War. Its a game of medium complexity but lots of fun for the history buffs and gamers. Probably my favorite competitive game.

You'll have to take my rating with a grain of salt.  I only played once, trying to learn how by teaching my eight-year-old, and I'm not quite sure we understood it all.  It seemed like there was very little conflict, and when there was, it was very limited.  May have been missing out on something.  Liked the card system, but knowing the high rating was expecting a bit more.  Will have to revisit and play with someone with more gaming experience.  [Christmas gift 2008]

I really like this game.  The theme plays out through the incredible components and mechanics (i.e. Battle Cards!).  I think the two sides are well balanced and the cards create for some interesting decisions about how to best utilize what is dealt in a given situation.  This allows you to plan ahead in detail during each round but having imperfect information about what hand you will get in the next round.  I find that unknown incredibly fun and engaging.

I like it... alot...
Everything seems to mesh nearly perfectly, I like the battle card system.  Wouldn't it be cool to play the battles using C&C:A?  That would make this a very long game, though.  Can't wait to play again. 
Update: This gets better with each play,  no two games alike.  We have instituted a few house rules to make it more balanced...makes it harder for Carthage to build an insurmountable early advantage... 
(May pick up a second travel copy, so I can leave one setup at home.)

DID get a second copy, which my 21 year old son now has at school.  4/13

Joshbot sent me the unpainted generals miniatures, awesome!

FINALLY got time to paint these fragile beauties, will post results soon. edit-They are done!

The more I play this, the better it seems to get.

Have played probably 25 times now.

Now waiting for Hamilcar expansion.

Update...The one game I will keep always, and play forever.

3/14  First game via Vassal completed with my son who is at University of Missouri at Columbia.  We had a great timeplaying and it was so close at the end it could have gone either way...Carthage won in a final battle in Carthage itself.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game, all of the mechanics mesh well and the game is comstantly tense. It's a bit tough to explain the rules, but it is a wargame and that has to be expected.

As with a lot of wargames, if you go down early it is unlikely that you'll ever get back up again without a lot of skill and luck.

Unfortunately, being a longish 2-player game, Hannibal doesn't hit the table as often as I would like as most of the groups I play with tend towards mid-length Euros which don't leave a lot of scope for two players to go off and do thir own thing too often, and especially not for 2.5-3 hours.

This game is on my 'To Review List'. Watch this space.

Two partial games.  My more full play was with the Carthaginians, and I like the tension: they were wiping the floor with the Romans, but it always felt like they were one or two disasters away from utter collapse (in my game, disaster #1: Hannibal's brother drowns with 10CUs; disaster #2: Hannibal is killed by choosing the wrong battle card to concentrate on followed by a horrible retreat roll).

See my complaints below, but this is the only game that I've played for years, so it deserves a 10.

I'd rate this higher if it didn't feel like "Fortress Cisalpania" was the ideal (and somewhat dull) strategy for Carthage.  (Possibly use an alternate set-up.)

Possibly solve by having Rome win on ties.

There are a few useful house rules.

Of all the leader based card driven wargames, Hannibal without a doubt works the best. The political aspect is well integrated with the military aspect, and it means you've always got stuff to do with your ops. Everything about Hannibal is pretty much spot on, it doesn't have too much or too little. The playing time is right, the complexity is reasonable, the unit density isn't overwhelming, the thematic integration is excellent, there's a good sense of tension and decision making, both players get to play some offense and defense, there are multiple ways to win, the balance is pretty good and there isn't too much scripting. I do have a few concerns. One, Carthage is very fragile. You have to scavenge with them and really play the system. That leads to some learning curve due to some counter-intuitiveness and also some gamey tactics. Two, the luck of the draw really is a big deal here. The game is all about delaying and using your last plays to steal territories, but he who draws Messenger Intercepted, the Revolts, the Diplomacy cards, etc is at a big advantage. In fact, I'd go so far to say that Carthage's entire game is based around this sort of thing since they can't win a head on fight in the long run. Third, the game really can stall out in unsatisfying ways with the roadblock strategy. I think I may ultimately prefer We the People to Hannibal due to the mentioned roadblock issue and Hannibal's longer playing time (3 hours), but I can't argue that the systems in Hannibal are much more in sync with each other. And it's definitely got an epic feel for a card driven game, with good emphasis on both unit maneuvering and hand management.

I have only one complaint about this otherwise exciting game and that is the beginning.  It's pretty obvious you want to send Hannibal north into Italy and the obvious Roman response is to pile guys up there.  It would be nice to have more opening strategies or at least to have one that didn't end in stalemate so often. Hannibal is just too powerful early for Rome to engage, but too important for Carthage to risk against a superior Roman force.  So it ends up with both sides going through the early motions before the game really opens up in other spheres.

The theme is very well implemented, and the battles are very exciting, but it seems that you spend the whole game (all 4 hours of it) doing the same things over and over again... hardly anything new shows up. You try to get strong and go into a battle and hope to win. If you don't, you run trying not to get killed. The game seems to move at the pace of a turtle.

Some events are either completely useless or incredibly strong, depending on the situation, which is annoying. Playing Carthage without getting the "Hannibal charms Italy" card is incredibly tough, for an example.

RATING: 9
One of my favourite 'war-game' games length fits into an evening and I like the period.

At one point had both valley games and avalon hill versions. VG generals were a joke, years to get them and smashed beyond recognition.

Didn't much like the VG graphics - traded, kept my beaten up worn (and loved) AH version.

De los primeros wargames card-driven que hubo. Es bastante sencillo de jugar, aunque las explicaciones llevan un ratín. Está bastante bien simulado el tema histórico (por ejemplo, para Cartago, el mar es muy peligroso).. y las batallas son cortas (una serie de cartas que hay que ir igualando y ganar la iniciativa).

Me gustó bastante. Recomendable.. muy buena opción si hay dos jugadores y no saben a qué darle. :)

(> 20 plays) This game is great! It is taking the game mechanics which have been introduced with "We the People" to a higher level. The game rules aren't very complex; you simply have to read 12 pages of rules, but nevertheless the game itself is full of important decisions and its outcome will often be at the cutting edge until the last turn. Great stuff!

Wow, what a game!  In my first game without major rules screw-ups, lost in a battle of disastrous luck for Hannibal in the next-to-last round.  Up until then things were pretty well matched, and both players enjoyed the game.  Would like to play this again soon!

RATING: 8
This was maybe the first wargame I played with my girlfriend. We both like this one !

The Carthage player must be somewhat carefull not to lose Hannibal, while Rome stands in a more safer ground, but both player has a chance to win.

The battle system is somewhat strange, but ok.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Played as Carthage in my first game.  Lots of tense moments with meaningful decisions to make most of the time (except for Carthaginian reinforcements...this is a no brainer).  I do like the battle card resolution mechanic.  Fun stuff that!

Ended up winning during turn 7 when Hannibal defeated Scipio Africanus and wiped out his 9-force army causing him to need to remove one more PC than he had available (only 3).  The writing was on the wall however, as I had ended T6 with 13 provinces to Rome's 3.

Loss game #2 as the Romans and #3 as Carthage.  Won game #4 by sacking Rome in Turn 5 (without the aid of Siege Train).  I had nearly had sacked it on Turn 4.  Game #5 as Rome was not a good experience, as I conceded very early in Turn 3 when I lost my entire huge 19 army to a quick double envelopment (I had one other force of 5 at Rome).  Game #6, again as Rome, is in progress.

RATING: 9
One of the best two player gaming experiences out there. Tense, balanced, historical, a bit of chaos and luck (it IS war) - what an incredible system has been created to simulate this epochal conflict. So much to conquer and control with limited resources requires careful planning. This is more an area control game than a wargame, but a classic. The battle card play during combat makes rolling the dice seem archaic. Any outcome is possible, even if playing a blocking strategy by the Romans in the beginning of the conflict.

Valley Games edition. This game looks gorgeous, but I need to find opponents to play it more often. Looks like becoming a favorite of mine, not difficult considering my love for all things ancient Rome.
-----------------
The more I play it, the less I like it. Cards are unbalanced (some events are so powerful that they dictate your moves) and thus luck of the draw is more important than players' skills. There aren't many different strategies either.

Comments after intial play.

Well, all the hype that I have been subjected to did not disappoint. I really quite liked the experience. There is a simplicity to the rules that I like. Furthermore, I found that the relatively broad expanse of the map allowed for a number of thoughtful decisions; yet essentially being able to narrow those plans down to three theatres with satellite areas. That helps the newbie a wee bit. The play was thought provoking without being a strain over the 5+ hours of playtime. All in all, I am anxious for more plays.

And the battle cards! Well, they were fun. A bit of a game within a game. 

PROS: Challenging situation with what appears to be some replayability. Fun decisions without being weighty or onerous. The card events are interesting and enhance the feel of the subject. Battle cards provide a game within a game.

CONS: The battle cards can slow things down a bit. Initial session ran to 5.5 hours which I think can be reduced to about 4...maybe. Too long for a weekday evening?

Finally got to play.  A thoroughly excellent game.  I love the theme in this game.  It feels a lot like Shogun (or rather - Shogun feels a lot like this), since there is a home front to worry about as well as trying to apply enough pressure  to an opponents territories to tip them out of control (even if just).

Love the game, plays quite simply despite the rules.  Not sure about the combat system - I think I like it, but will have to play more to really cement my thoughts.

Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not entirely sure about this game. The territory control elements are interesting and I like the flavor (plus, the VG edition is absolutely gorgeous). That said, I'm not sold on the card-driven combat resolution and the playtime is *way* longer than I would like. If I'm going to commit that amount of time to a 2p game, I'd far rather be playing Twilight Struggle (or even Hammer of the Scots + a couple rounds of Race for the Galaxy). As a result, I'm likely going to be trading this one away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Now that I have finally had a chance to play it, I can say that the game is fantastic.  I own the Valley Games edition, and it is a top notch production using any standard (I can't compare it to AH as I've never seen it).  The game is a lot of fun and I really enjoy the use of cards for the battle.  It does drag some battles out, which can make it inordinately long for PBEM, but it is actually way more fun than the "bucket of dice" alternative.  The single roll variants may speed up play - especially useful if playing solitaire - but removes all of the drama in the close fights.  The strategy here is clever and close games can go down to the wire.  It is hardly a free for all in combat as Carthage's replenishments are just not sufficient to outlast a determined Rome.  Carthage must play the game of controlling spaces, while Rome needs to exact pain at every opportunity right up to the end.

Playing it online via ACTS (good card management, terrible map management), wargameroom (very well done, live play only) as well as VASSAL and CB.  Valley Games has breathed life back into this game and kudos to them plus the old guard for such an entertaining game.

Hannibal is a great game, and I like ancient war themed games, although I've really owned only this one, and have played not too many.  My fiance is not a big fan, and while I understand our differences over theme, I think she's nuts for hating the card system - well, partly nuts.  The battle deck does get a little old at times, and makes the game longer than it needs to be.

I'm anxious to play this one again.  I liked the feel of it, and the tension involved in the movement and battles.  I'm not a fan of the battle system itself, but I'm realizing that there is a fairness to it that should play out over multiple playings, and its a lot better than rolling dice on a table and shrugging.

UPDATE: Quick Take on the new edition: In general, I like the new edition. It's not perfect, and ultimately isn't overall as nice as the old AH edition, but it's very solid and excellent in some areas. What I like about the new edition: great box, good and attractive rules, the puzzle-board is great and gets you a hgh-quality board without the usual hazards of puzzle-boards (it's a vastly better solution than the "deluxe" GMT boards), and I love the Roman and Carthaginian dice. And assuming I get them at some point, I'll like the plastic generals. What's not so hot: CG graphics are over-used, there are a number of unattractive cards that belong in a computer game, not a board game; they might have been better sticking with the old line drawings. The battle cards aren't great; they're noisy and static, and the disruptive purple band breaks the color scheme of the game in my opinion (plus, as purple is a color associated with Rome, it seems to give the battle cards a bias). The important info on the strategy cards (the number) is too small. What I think was positively bone-headed: the numbers on the CUs are *way* too small. Come on, this is not rocket science. Even GMT got this right. And switching to hexagonal PCs (instead of round ones) boggles the mind; the Cartheginian PCs and tribe markers are graphically much too similar - I have absolutely no idea why this switch was made, the only rational answer I can come up with is that for some reason an appropriate circular die was unavailable or too expensive.

Overall the production is aggravating because where it's good, it's really good, but they dropped the ball in just enough ways to make the new edition not as good as the old one. The font problem with the CUs is the most glaring, but the overuse of CG and the hexagonal PCs are problematic as well. The old edition had its shortcomings, but it was more cohesive and much more usable. I vent about this becuase its always frustrating when a reprint, in which much was re-done and much was done extraordinarily well, is still actually overall inferior to the original because of a few obvious shortcomings. I am reminded of the Brazillian Modern Art, which was so nice in so many ways, but then for some bizarre reason dropped the wonderful, descriptive, internationalized auction symbols that every previous edition had used. 
---
Although only the second game in the genre of We The People-inspired games (as of 7/02, this numbers ~8 games!), Hannibal is really the system at its peak - most of the other games try to shoehorn the system into a game that doesn't quite fit it, to varying degrees of success (PoG is probably the best of the rest, althouh it is also the most significant overhaul of the basic game). Hannibal also represents, for me, a near-perfect design as a game; everything that is included has a significant purpose, the design is clean and coherent, the game has an ease of learning that belies the depth of the game, and the historical flavor is tremendous without dominating the game a la Richard Berg or acting as a straightjacket. This is a fairly complex game when compared to the modern, lighter multi-player fare, but anyone who is not too complexity-averse should try this game even if not generally into historical or simulation gaming.

Nice clean design, very clever political system that both encourages aggression and simulates the crumbling of political alliances. However, the cards do not build a narrative that I found believable. Rather as with its younger brother SWORD OF ROME this game has all the events but not in any order.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is my favorite wargame. Simple. Balanced. Lots of excitement and dramatic turn of events. Wonderful portrayal of the 2nd Punic War. An absolute classic.

Some people object to the battle cards. I think they're great! I wish that some day some newer CDG titles will also employ this mechanism.

Further, it is nice to have a wargame actually having a mounted map. The map look and the cards cannot compare to present-day GMT or Phalanx offerings, but I guess this is state-of-the-art design for an Avalon Hill game (and looks reasonably good). I wish though that Descartes had done more with the German edition I own.

In any case, this game really NEEDS to be reprinted (preferably with better production values). I hear that at least English language versions now cost a fortune at Ebay. Phalanx Games should really get in touch with HASBRO (if they're the ones with the rights) and release a new edition. 

For me, the King of the Card-Driven Wargames (and I'm a big fan of those). And a perfect introduction to the wargame genre as a whole. 

-----
Minor criticisms (and the reason why I'm not giving Hannibal a 10): I believe the Romans are overly encouraged to turn Italy into an iron fortress in the early turns and stacking lots of units there rather than undertaking risky overseas expeditions. I've posted a variant of mine which adresses this concern.

Another point which somewhat bothers me is the relatively low importance of the cities. Considering  the effort involved in besieging the non-capital cities, the payoff is IMO too slim. I've equally posted a variant adressing this - though it may be a tad too unforgiving.

Hannibal is not the world-beater I was expecting, and after having played a couple of times now I am glad that I traded it away way back when.

Lots of difficult decisions every turn. Needs to be played several times to appreciate the depth and to fully grasp the rules. It's quite long (about 4+ hours assuming that neither Rome nor Carthage fall) but the assymetrical nature of this game is fascinating and I'm always surprised how quickly the time goes. About 30 plays to date.

Avalon Hill vs Valley Games versions: The Valley Games reprint is very nice. The jigsaw board is excellent (mine sits flat anyway) as are the counters. The Roman and Carthaginian dice are a nice novelty but I'm not sure that they are totally fair and prefer to use something a bit heavier. The plastic insert holds the components pretty well. The card backs of the strategy and battle cards are confusingly similar and the art on the strategy cards was obviously computer generated and isn't as pleasing as the original Avalon Hill line drawings. Unfortunately the rules aren't totally comprehensive so it is necessary to check the forums for many minor rules questions.

Nice balance between political and military control.  Too many things to do, depending on your cards.  The card draw really dictates how you have to play your turn, so long-term strategy is limited.  What is there is a good time.  The battles are nice and simple.  Really, the game is about trying to have more cards in your hand than the other person for when battle take place.

RATING: 8.5
Classic CDG. Prefer Successors because of the context, but obviously this is a better two player set up with some interesting strengths and weaknesses on each side. Our first game saw Hannibal come within a hair's breadth of capturing Rome, only to be defeated at the last minute by a relief army (which may have not even got there if we had a better grasp of the interception rules). Anyway, Rome was off the hook and managed to slowly get the upper hand, ending in a siege of Carthage. Hannibal was recalled to raise the siege, more for his skill than the paltry remnants of his army, as this would put Carthage on an even BC footing for the final showdown. Varro of all people throws himself in Hannibal's path before he crosses the Med, speedbump style, to try to at least reduce his army by one to give Rome the edge. Three cards is all he has versus Hannibal's six, but three straight flank lefts is all he needs. Hannibal is displaced, and Carthage concedes. Revenge for Cannae!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An excellent game, my respect for it grows with each session.  While it lacks the elegance of its father, "We the People", it has greater depth and is more robust.  Hannibal's rules have more chrome, but the additional time spent learning them pays tremendous dividends.

For example, armies that loose battles can retreat over their opponent's PC markers (unlike WtP), but they loose a unit of strength per PC marker traversed, and must end their retreat in a friendly controlled space.  So there are more rules, but not too excessively so, and the result is one of the best gaming experiences to be had. 

At its core, the game is all about Political Control.  But the rulebook is organized in turn order, so the Political Control rules are relegated to section 19, and the game's most central aspect is not stressed as well as one might hope.  Newbies should read section 19 before diving into the rulebook - as an understanding of PC and the way it pervades all other aspect of the game, combat, movement, victory .. is essential for success and enjoyment.

The Valley Games reprint is much appreciated and reasonably well produced but far from flawless.  The board is graphically *way* too busy - to the point of obscuring important game information.  The colors used in Italy are too dark, making it difficult to see regional boundaries and transit routes.  The strength value on the combat units and the Ops value on strategy cards two of the game's most critical pieces of information, are too small.  The linen texture of the counters and board is very slippery, leaving counters sliding about the board during play.  And as a sort of coup de grace, the Carthaginian six sided die is a waste of perfectly good wood.  Valley Games seems to be cutting out a niche based on gorgeous games with graphic choices that obscure or negatively impact important game information.

Given this game's reputation and the reprint's affordability, it is definitely worth trying.

Played once, was a bit disappointed.  Ran a bit long, and I found the abstractness of the influence markers dissonant with the concrete strategic movement of armies on the map.  I love the tactical battle system of the cards, even if it lengthens the game some.

I found We the People, while similar, a better game.

RATING: 9
[5+] My first five games of Hannibal have been very enjoyable, but I'm not sure I rank it over Wilderness War or War of the Ring in the card-driven wargame department.  I would still like to play more, though, because each time has been enjoyable.  My reservation in rating it higher than the other two card-driven wargames in question lies in the card mixture.  It seems possible in both Wilderness War and War of the Ring to mitigate erratic hands using other facets of the game.  It could have been aberrations in the games I played, however.  I'm also not completely sold on the card-driven tactical combat mechanism.  It's enjoyable, but I'm not sure it's enjoyable enough for the payoff.  Still, I give it an eight currently, which is high enough for me to want to play more!  But I'm starting to itch to go back to another CDG.

RATING: 9
Had it, traded it away. While the gameplay is very nice, and the pieces are of decent quality, I'm concerned about how this game is the "gold standard" of the gaming world. Sooner or later one of the bigger publishing companies is going to grab the rights to this game, and while the general gaming world will applaud, the many people out there who put it under their mattress to asure themselves of the collectability aspect of board games (like that of art and baseball cards) will find themselves sorely disappointed.

Played two of nine turns. I doubt I'll ever play more than that. The strategy cards are too hit or miss, which is a problem in 1960 & TS both of which I like, but it never felt as crippling as it did in this game. I like the influence mechanic. I hate, hate, hate the combat. Too random and it left me just shaking my head and thinking WTF. You can go into a battle with every advantage and two die rolls later be completely obliterated. Then add on all the fiddly little and extraneous rules and it felt like bookkeeping where the final tallies were done at random.

I think when both players are familiar with the decks, the game will really open its petals and I'll see what the buzz is about.I really dig the card-driven mechanic to start with.  I found that for days after my first playing, I've been reflecting on the game and thinking of things to try.  Perhaps the greatest feature of the game is the way that combat is detrimental to both sides, but forces apply pressure that leads to combat eventually.  Just like war.

Picked this up back in 1996 - not a bad game - almost karked it when I saw how high its rating is on BBG! I was impressed by the mapboard and the game mechanics for the time, and love anything on Rome - but got bored with it after a couple of plays.
I now have the 2nd edition and find the game more interesting with wonderful theme and graphics. It does appear a little easy for Rome to win unless Carthage gets a very good hand of cards each turn. There are some fiddley rules and the battle card system is a bit of a lottery but it's still great to play. Unfortunately little chance of getting to the table as it takes a good 5 hours to play.

The first few plays of this will take a long time, but I think we'll get it down to three hours eventually.  Not a ton of meat to this game.  The battles are far from predictable.  VG edition looks incredible.  The rulebook is easy to understand.  My sentences are getting shorter.  

Dec 2011 - Third game of this now.  Solid and not too complicated.  Maybe not enough going on?  I don't know.  Not blown away.  We'll see.

Feb 2012 - Nicest board ever.  Just don't know how often I will get to play this one.

(Note: this pertains to the AH edition of the game) This is overall a very interesting game, though it has a few warts.  I would rate it higher, but I really dislike the battle cards.  They are a-historic in their mechanics and produce the same result as a simple d6 on a CRT.

Very good rather long and complex game.
Interesting to find the battle card fights in an compley game like this, they are fast and simple fun.

Terrible rules, translation errors in the german edition, download second edition rules, but even then the first game might take 6+ hours for players with complex games experience.

I would rate it higher but certain rules are unintuitive and you have to consult the rules book a lot because there are no nice handout player aids and only a few aids are printed on the board.

Complex card-driven [u]strategic[/u]/operational wargame who implements wonderfully the historical period. It has tension, provides tough decisions and it's narrative.

Initial rating after 3 plays. I own the Valley Games edition.

This a good game. It is thematic (rating +1), the sides are asymmetric (rating +1) the gameplay is tense with many interesting choices (rating +2).  Unfortunately it is too long: 5-7 hours, especially considering the amount of luck involved. There is a big element of luck in battle: what cards are dealt, who gets the initiative, the retreat losses roll etc. You can lose even if odds seem to be strongly in your favour. I would be OK with that – the battle system gives the game a distinctive feel – if the battle luck was balanced at the strategic level. Unfortunately there is nothing at the strategic level that mitigates a loss of full 10 unit stack due to bad luck in a single battle: an event that can cost you the game, especially if you are playing Carthage. Moreover, the game is also random at the strategic level, e.g. some cards are always useful but some are rather situational. (overall rating -2 for the excessive luck). Finally, reshuffling the battle deck is a chore.

The board and pieces look nice (rating +1) but there are issues of functionality. For instance, borders of provinces and connections between spaces do not stand sufficiently out in Italy after the placement of political control markers. Or consider the unit tokens: the number on the unit tokens is too small and different on the sides leading to mistakes, the tokens also do not stack well: overall the use of locking plastic chips of different colours (e.g. Modern Art chips) would have worked much better. (rating -1 for lack of functionality). The rules (including card instructions) are reasonably well written but could clearer, especially considering that this a reprint of a classic game. Some cards do not mention all the effects, even though there is room on the card for extra text. Very regrattably there are two errors in the information printed on the board (modifier for crossing non-alps pass, the special ability of Fabius)

Wowza. The rules to this game (VG edition, arrived at long last) are [i]tough[/i]. Not as in difficult, but as in 'copious'. And wargamers think that these are average in terms of complexity...? Closest masochists, the lot of them.

My initial play against my significant other of just 3 rounds was a sobering experience with many mistakes made and learned from. Like: 'Don't have Hannibal walk into Italy without a hidey-hole to retreat to'. Hannibal is a powerful general, true, but he [i]can[/i] be beaten and Carthage should only risk the odds if the odds are [i]heavily[/i] in his favour. Another don't is 'Land a Roman army squat in the middle of Hispania when that area is blue as far as the eye can see'. A powerful do is 'Major Campaign cards are very useful in saving multiple strategy cards for it allows you to move multiple generals with just one card'. All in all, it's a lot more ad hoc and uncertain than I imagined from reading the rules: this is a Good Thing. I disliked Revolution intensely because it [i]didn't[/i] have a lot of uncertainty to work with—unfortunately, I cannot at this moment say with any certainty whether the randomness of the cards is 'too much' or 'just right' or simply 'okay'.

There has been considerably discussion about the battle cards: despite me being an absolute rookie, I'm not sure I like them a great deal. The game is the strategy cards; playing a dozen different cards in an 'I think that you think that I think ...'-subgame feels a bit off for some reason. I could live very easily with a simpler system or just plain dice like, for example, found in Mare Nostrum. Yes, I know, Hannibal should have not [i]actually[/i] have something like in MN: I'm merely using it to illustrate that simple systems are not always a Bad Thing™. The reason for me preferring dice is their speed: a couple of throws, and you're done. Next strategy card, please! Of course, you'd lose out on an important tactic: withdrawal.

But this is all coming from an absolute rookie of course, so don't pay him any attention :-). Nevertheless, this game is serious business, and should be treated as such. I think the diversity with the cards will pull it through in the end; now it's just table time which it desperately requires so you're not buried in a rule book all the time.

[b]Update[/b] Hannibal turned out to be... well, a bridge too far, I guess the most fitting expression is. It's not really an issue of play time, as a game lasting as long will find a way to my table if it is fun enough. No, the problem was the voluminous rules with (paraphrasing here) exceptions to subsubsubclauses. Games lasting this long are only feasible at my table if people 'get' the rules easily and quickly; and Hannibal fails on this account. I wish it were different, but I guess I'm simply not sufficiently hardcore to cope. Hannibal was, quite simply, not a game for us. I let it go, a little wiser about where our boundaries are.

And the rate for this game? To be perfectly honest, in hindsight I doubt it would rise above a 5.

I've probably played this game more than any other wargame and still am willing to play anytime.  The only negative is that the "superstack" strategy by Rome makes it awful tough for Carthage to win.  I still have fun playing even when I lose as Carthage.  And when Hannibal wins, whoopee!  But in my group Carthage only wins about one out of three games.

The Valley Games rulebook is for the most part well presented, but contains perhaps the most misplaced "hidden" key rule I have ever seen buried in a rulebook -- I believe it's a section 19.2 "exception" that is the only place in the rulebook or the player aid that mentions one of the critical dynamics of the game: changing political markers based on the presence of your combat units sitting in your opponent's provinces. FYI!

Card-driven game; I do not understand why this game has such a high BGG ranking. The game looks beautiful and is quite fun to play, but the numerous exceptions bother me and do not add enough to justify them. The game asks to much reference, even after playing a few times; Julius Caesar is a similar game, but it plays much easier and brings me (maybe because of that) at least as much fun. Besides, in Hannibal it is quite good possible that a smaller force beats a larger force just by the influence of cards; even extremely powerful cards exist, which could decide the game; battle results are often unexpected; finally this game seems to always be played according to the same lines; in short, this is a pretty fun game, but it has quite a few disadvantages for me.

I've played Hannibal dozens of times and it's still a very challenging, fun and tense game. What makes it even better: it's relatively easy to learn and the game can be finished in one evening. 
The way the history of the 2nd Punic War has been converted into this game, is amazing. Both sides have there own strengths and weaknesses, but fortunately each game is different. The only negative aspect: it's oop, but not on my shelf... 
Pre-ordered the Valley Games ed. 
08/10/07: got it. Despite the Valley Games ed. looking better than the old AH version, I prefer the latter: info is better presented. For instance: in the VG version it's very hard to distinguish borders in Italy. Anyway, I'm glad I've finally added the game to my collection without paying well over € 100,- for it.

I like the asymmetry here. I like how every card has an event, rather than some just being usable for OPs, as in Washington's War. The game is historically accurate without too much rules overhead. Combat is cumbersome at times, and I have yet to play a game without referencing the rules. Still, it is a wonderful game with many difficult decisions for each side. 

Although the card-based combat system lengthens the game significantly, I'm now okay with it, even though I still think a nice CRT would be great as an alternative. There's incredible tension from the playing of battle cards, and you can't really mimic that with a die roll.

Naval combat has been abstracted away with simple negative modifiers to a die roll for success/failure of transporting armies via ports. For Carthage, that is. Rome had naval superiority during that time and can sail at will (well, still needs a 3 Ops card to do so).

After 16 plays, I'm finally comfortable with the rules (both sides) and can knock out a game with another experienced player in about 3.5 hours with minimal rules referencing. The more I play it, the better it gets. It's just an amazing design, both from an historical and gameplay standpoint. Hannibal is such a badass--but you can't be too bold with him. I have yet to risk sailing with him, and even when he marches into Italy, you have to make sure to keep him near Carthaginian control markers so he has a place to retreat to, in the unlikely event he loses a battle or (more likely) withdraws. Getting Hannibal killed will make things much more difficult for the Carthaginian player, and should be the Roman player's goal.  

P.S. I really don't care that I don't own the generals minis. The cardboard tokens work just fine, and are just as immersive. 

Playing Carthage is difficult for a newbie, I find. Rome is easier to play well as a new player. No need to worry about naval travel failure. With Carthage, I rarely risk sailing until I have a -4 or -5 modifier to the die roll. 

We play with the variant rule regarding the Messenger Intercepted event--the player playing the event must immediately take another action. 

Holy crap are there some glaring errors in both the rulebook (VG) and the mapboard. Crossing a non-Alps pass s/b -2 modifier, Fabius' ability should read simply "avoid battle on a 1-5", and the regions of Italy are difficult to distinguish. Several spelling mistakes on the board and/or general tokens (i.e. Flaminus s/b Flaminius), Macedonia misspelled on the Naval Chart, and "general" misspelled on the "Rome Dismisses Proconsul" strategy card. I would love to see GMT publish this.

RATING: 10
Great game, great theme. Simple mechanics, yet lots of tough decisions to make with the dual op/event cards. The battle card & initiative system and the tie-in with leadership is brilliant. Minimal chrome. A relatively small deck size means every card will be seen at some point during the game, even if it is by your opponent, so you typically generate some sort of coherent narrative.

The complaints about the battle card system should be ignored, especially from the whiny "takes too long" euro crowd. Ancient warfare was usually won by the better general, even at 1:2 odds. The cards, leaders, and initiative system tie that all together in an easy, natural way. Combat systems using a single die roll cannot reasonably simulate (or even approximate) ancient battles, and are completely unsatisfactory.

I can't say I'm a fan of the new puzzle board from Valley Games but that's a minor complaint.

RATING: 10
A very early card-driven wargame, but still one of the best. A few minor modifications from "We the People" have cleaned up things like battle resolution a bit.
More significantly, the map layout and mechanisms for removing and changing political control markers give the game a more mobile and dynamic feel.

It was an unobtainable grail game which, even if I could have got hold of, I doubted I would have found anyone to play it with. However thanks to VG's reprint I now have it, and thanks to BGG I found someone to play it against - only once so far (twice now) - but hey I'm not complaining. Nor am I complaining about the game which lived up to expectations and it's high rating. 

Lots of options/strategies each turn, cards means lots of variety but still a good historic sim, and the battle resolution mechanism is tremendous. Even first game was playable in a session. Recommended

Awesome, truly fantastic game! There are few games out there that really deserve their classic status but I feel Hannibal is one of them. It's easy to teach and play without becoming too simplified and silly.

The game focus on the struggle between Carthage and Rome in the 2nd Punic war with all what that entails. Hannibal of course, elephants, marches across the Alps, tense battles, attrition, political control of provinces and more. The most amazing thing is that everything works; nothing in the game feels forced or out of place. Despite the length of the rulebook it's a very clear system that allow very few gamey moves if any.

Hannibal being a card driven game means you'll have several tough decisions to make with every card play; activate a general, build up some political support, build troops or play the card for its event. The cards also makes certain that no two games will be alike.

My only minor gripe with it is that the card draws can ruin the game on some occasions. There are cards that give one player several activations in a row and that can be a game winner at the right moment. It usual evens out in the end but having several of your messengers intercepted in the same game certainly makes you gnash your teeth. We usually play with the optional rule for "Messenger Intercepted" found in the VG edition rules.

Update: Sold my old German version and bought the new VG one. Excellent stuff! Of course preordered the new Phalanx edition as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game!  It's defintely a notch above We the People.  The card-driven system really shines as Operation Cards & Event Cards have been combined.  No more dead cards in hand.  This is my rating after 2 plays.  I may rate this a 10 after a few more plays.  I need a few more plays to test the depth/strategy.  

Update: Really this should be a 10.  However, there is a good bit of complexity to it...and that keeps me from rating it a 10.

The problem is I get to play it so seldom that I have to relearn it each time. If I could get it to the table a few times a year, I'd probably put it up at 10.

RATING: 8
Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage was a bit of a revelation for me, tying together multiple wargames threads that I enjoy into a complete, satisfying package. It is one of the first games in a long, long time that I have instantly rated a 9 and have found a place in my Top 10. It is a simply a great design. What makes it so great? Well, I will tell you. 

1) Differentiated Leaders. Maybe it is my role-playing game background talking, or my desire to simulate the fact that some commanders were better than others, but I appreciate the fact that different leaders have different statistics and abilities. While it might have been slightly better to separate a leader’s stats into three areas (battle rating, agility, and strategy rating), how they do it is good enough, particularly when you add in the special abilities of each leader.

2) Events and Operations on one card. My introduction to card-driven games came from 1960, Here I Stand, and Twilight Struggle so I am used to having my events and ops combined into one card package. The fact that Hannibal uses this, rather than the inferior events and operations are separate card types of We the People/Washington’s War, is greatly appreciated. I wonder why they didn’t do some work and incorporating this superior development when they republished We the People as Washington’s War?

3) A neat mini-game. Hannibal uses a battle card system to resolve combat, where each player is given a hand of cards, the size of which is based on a number of factors, and where each player plays a card to attack, which the defending player must then match. Then the defending player has an opportunity to seize the offensive. If the player does, then they are able to play the leading card, if they fail, then they must continue matching the attacker. The first person to be unable to match the played card loses the battle. While I appreciate the speed of dice-based resolution mechanics, the battle system of Hannibal is pretty fun. The combination of bluffing and hand management produces building tension and fun in a way that a simple die roll can not.

4) A game of politics, where battles are an extension of this political battle. I am fascinated by both history and politics so the fact that the majority of the card driven games I have played so far (Hannibal, Here I Stand, Washington’s War, and Twilight Struggle) are at their heart political games is something that I greatly enjoy. Games that are purely focused on wars are generally less interesting to me unless they are games focused on individual battles. What I particularly like about Hannibal’s implementation of this idea is the fact that winning and losing battles matter. Every time you lose a battle you have to remove influence markers based on the amount of men you lose. This is something that was absent from the other CDG games that I have played, and makes total sense. Battles can have significant repercussions in the support of local leaders, and the fact that you can lose that support, and thus have to spend influence to regain it is an excellent design decision

5) Antiquity. In euros and economic games I tend to have only a minor interest in theme. As long as the game is good, I am willing to get past ludicrous or pasted on themes. War games are different, and it takes a very well regarded design for me to get past thematic disinterest enough to play it. So my favorite war game theme is ancients, and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is clearly ancients themed. Win. 

There is more to it than that, but if go into any greater detail, I would have to turn this into a review. As it stands, I am tempted to write one anyway, but it will have to wait until I have played it more than twice. Still, it’s a great game and if you like Washington’s War and are okay with a slight increase in complexity and play time, then Hannibal is a great step up. 

Edit: On further play, I have started to find the game to feel a bit repetitive, I am not sure though if that is due to my frequent opponents or simply due to the game. As it stands, I am lowering the game's rating to an 8.

RATING: 10
Players play either Rome or Carthage, and battle out the 2nd Punic War.  Players play cards to move troops around the point to point mapboard, or to trigger events.  The ultimate objective is to establish political control in the various provinces, and the use of force is simply a tool to achieve that end.  We The People started it, Hannibal took it to the next step.  In some ways this is my favorite of the "series" with the perfect mix of complexity and playability.  The two sides play pleasantly differently, as the Carthage player frantically pulls every trick in the book to try and hold back the crushing power of Rome.

[Simonitch] Truly amazing, fun, tense wargame. No economy to consider, just combat and an abstract "political control token" system that is smooth and fast. Win those battles or face unrest at home.

There is a larger learning curve with this game when compared to Twilight Struggle or 1960.  After playing twice I'm beginning to see how it works, but I still don't think I'm appreciating some of the complexities.  Carthage has won both our game by the end of turn 4.

This is my first foray into a heavier wargame (Nexus Ops being the first) and OMG it was amazing. VG , Mike Doyle and Kurt Miller did an amazing job of immersing you in the world of the 2nd Punic War. I love the fact that it not just about kicking ass on the fields of Spain, Africa, Italy etc. but also kickin' ass through political control. 

I LOVE the card driven mechanic which creates amazing tension during battles as having a larger hand doesn't guarantee victory. The choices of how you play every Strategy card are endless, as what you initially set out do could change in an instant by your opponent's choice of card played. 

AHHHH! This hits my G-Spot (game spot) perfectly. Love it! 

A few more plays and this could easily be an eleven.

The game is a 9/10, but the rules are about a 3/10.   No good examples, and about 80% of it you won't need.   But, the game is intense and the battle card system is one of the most innovative and fun combat systems I've ever seen.  The strategy cards aren't quite as tense as Twilight Struggle, but the maneuvering of the armies more than makes up for it.  Gorgeous production (VG edition).   Don't let the rules dissuade you, find somebody who knows how to play to teach you.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Played for the first time.

This is one amazing simulation game I'd say. Of how it resembles and managed to capture the history and put it into play is simply fascinating. I was intimidated at first (I'm sure my opponent as well; we were taught by someone else) with all the rules and what can you do in your turn, thus missing some opportunities to place the Political Counters (PCs) on the open spot on certain provinces.

After only two to three rounds (a round takes quite a while, probably 30-40 minutes) I've managed to stream down of all the options available, but I realized it was too late. Carthage army already breached into Roman (now Italy) wall with his ground units (foot and elephant units) coming all the way from Spain.

The battle is pretty interesting as well. Depending on certain factors, both sides will be given battle cards that is taken from the same deck. The attacker will play a card (usually showing a battle/attack formation) and the defender needs to play the same exact card that matches the attacker card. If you can't, you simply lost. If you do, you have the chance to counter attack by rolling a die.

This game uses interesting mixtures of card driven mechanics and some dice rolling to check for attrition, retreat, sea exploration and such (so there are few tables you need to refer to, which are all displayed on the board).

Another thing to appreciate is how gorgeous the map is. It was an amazing experience, one that I will never forget. Although 4 hours of gaming and knowing that I've lost at the end, was a little disappointed. But it's okay, I always take my first game to be a learning game.

Long Live Roman Empire!

The Epic. This game is great, but requires a little commitment. It can be hard as Hannibal until you get an idea of the strategy. Its also worth noting this game can be pretty cruel. Sometimes, for no fault of your own (a really bad attrition roll, poor card draw), things can do totally south and you can feel like your out of the game. The thing is, this game swings back and forth, you might have lost on the 3rd turn, but be winning by the 5th.

Very historically evocative, constantly asks you hard questions and builds tension.

Played my homemade copy before buying the VG edition. What can I say? It's without a doubt a 10. It's a 10 simply because although the game is 10 years old, no other CDG has yet come to match it. Tense, exciting, great theming and all packaged in a game with a reasonable playing time. It's not totally historical, and you can be screwed by a certain amount of randomness, but the most important thing is that it's very playable. 3 hours of H:RvC or 20 hours of Ancient World vol II: Carthage? You decide.

Pros y contras: juego de guerra excelente, divertivo complejo. Inconveniente: sólo apto para ludópatas y es un bastante largo.
Hay polémica, pero yo creo que Roma lo tiene mucho más fácil con eso del control de los mares; los romanos deben hacer un ejército decente e ir a África, pero mejor por el este y de ahí ­, y por tierra llegar a Cartagho.Hay un cartagines que tiene una bonificación para embarcar: utilízalo y acude a Roma para dar guerra y distraer a los romanos mientras Hannibal y sus elefentitos pasan los Alpes.

RATING: 4
[2 plays] Unfortunately, this is too much of a "grind" game for me.  The battle card system and combination OPs/Event cards should really appeal over a Herman-style CDG, but the game is ultimately too tedious.  There's no tension between the ops/event choices.  

All you can do is but butt heads and gain that extra inch through brute force.  Clever moves (if there is such a thing in Hannibal) are inherently risky and the game obviously favors one side or the other depending whether Africanus is out, so there's little need to be clever in the first place.  There's so little contested political space, entire hands are quickly spent flipping a couple PC markers or nothing at all if you're really unlucky as the Romans.  

I find nearly every other CDG I've played to be so much more dynamic than Hannibal.  I'm surprised it's still so highly regarded considering how one dimensional it feels.  Most other CDGs have other layers of conflict on top of the board and many future considerations - deck management, multiple decks, seeded events, event tracks, etc.  It's all on the table from the beginning in Hannibal, but worse, I feel no tension.  Nothing convincingly pulls me in multiple directions.  I don't feel like I have any flexibility to sacrifice now for the greater good later.  It's just grind, grind, grind.

I must admit, I'm a sucker for all things Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. Someone should make a good film about them, with a better screenplay than Troy. Anyway, this is the definitive card-driven "Euro-wargame", complete with elephants. It's good looking, and the combat is abstract but effective. Happy to play whenever four hours presents itself and only one opponent can be found.

Ojo, tras una sola partida, y después de releer las reglas en busca de la siguiente.
Me parece un buen juego, con una buena mecanica basada en cartas, y lo suficientemente sencillo para que no sea un verdadero suplicio meterse a jugarlo.
Quizás pueda pecar, al cabo de un tiempo, de cierta falta de rejugabilidad, pero, en fin... ya veremos. Esta nota puede variar.

Pd.- Efectivamente :D ; después de jugar varias partidas me doy cuenta que es un juegazo como la copa de un pino. Y que debido a la cantidad de cartas existentes, las posibles variaciones, y los pocos turnos, la rejugabilidad no se resiente, o por lo menos no lo hace con 20 o 30 partidas a cuestas. Definitivamente le clavo un 10.

Kickstarter - Nov

When compared to more recent CDGs in this family it seems a bit dated and burdened by its chrome.  I appreciate the more recent, streamlined efforts.  The different subsystems certainly give it strategic depth and the event cards actual DO something, which can be a critique of more modern designs.  The Valley Games edition is nicely produced.  The map seems a bit dark and murky, but the quality of the cardboard bits is outstanding compared to its peers.

Actually, this one is a 10 as far as wargames go. However, I just don't have the time or energy to concentrate, learn the rules, and play it that much. I blame that on age, and a busy schedule! Those who enjoy lighter war games will love this one.

RATING: 9
Awesome game.  It's the second CDG I've played. (Twilight Struggle was the first).  I really like the way the Roman Generals come in and out of the game and the way the tension builds as Hannibal makes his way accross S. Europe and over the Alps wrecking havoc in his path.  Not a huge fan of the Battle card system but it's still fun.  The production value on this one is awsome as well (Valley games).

This game is AWESOME.  Rules are kind of a bear to make it through, but the cardplay is top-notch, and I actually *enjoy* the battle system, where superior numbers SHOULD win, but there's always that crazy element of battle that can cause defeat to a more powerful force.  That's represented well here.

After playing this, I went and read up on the history--the game was so good, I wanted to find out more about the battles and people it was based on.  (Same thing happened with Bonaparte at Marengo.)

RATING: 10
Simply the best card driven game ever produced. Its re-playability value is also the highest, as is its depth of play. Among its many strong points is its combat system, which is much more exciting then the standard CRT. The game basically is easy enough to learn but some of the stranger interactions require a look at the rules and the ability to compromise. It's an out-of-print and hard to get game. But it's not forgotten. I've seen mint copies go for $200.00 + on ebay. Compared to the number of times you will play it, that's still cheap. Superb. 

Update: The new edition incorporates the errata and is printed on a large jig-saw puzzle type board. The game is still a blast. It's simply the best two-player CDG I've ever played. No 2 games are the same after the first turn and it's always nail-biting time. Just consider it Twilight Struggle on steroids. If your game collection has more than 3 games, this has to be one of them.

RATING: 8
The beauty of Hannibal is that it is wide-open: there is a lot of room for strategic maneuver (about 100 map locations) and only a few units (typically each player will have no more than 3 or 4 locations that actually contain units at any given time).  So you have a few powerful stacks of units combined with a wide-open movement system (due to the use of sea movement, which always happens in every game).  It's so big and so sweeping - with grand-strategic events made possible through the creative play of card combinations that you receive 7, 8 and 9 at a time (depending on the game turn) that it can be really exciting and variable even within a game from turn to turn.

However, the flip-side of Hannibal's greatest strength is its weakness.  The possibility of wide-open grand-strategic change with just a few units in play makes it somewhat brittle - a characteristic that I have realized is true of nearly all of the card-driven war games. As a result games frequently do not go the distance: my experience is that only about every 3rd session of this type of game is actually fun.

When the cards come out in a fairly balanced way the game is easily a "10".  But most of the time: it's not nearly that good.

Neither of my plays represent a completed game.  The first was based on 1 1/2 turns that we got in before we ran out of time.  The second was based on about 3 1/2 turns before my opponent had to leave early.  Normally I don't list a play unless I actually finish the game, but it will probably be a while before I get in a full game, so I'm just going to do it!  Especially since I think I got a good feel for the different systems and how they work together, enough to think that it deserves the ratings it's been getting.

One of the best card driven battle games. It set the standard for others to follow. I never turn down the opportunity to face off vs a willing opponent (but they are far & few these days). The segmented board is beautiful to behold. Just enough tactics (in the form of cards) to allow some variety regarding attack. Very enjoyable if you have 3-4 hours free during an evening.

[b][i]Hannibal[/i][/b] is a great war game. The card driven action system is simultaneously fun and includes many events from history (so be careful, you'll probably learn something). The asymmetric play is tense and rewarding; both sides have tremendous strengths and the winner will be the player who better utilizes their side's abilities. With multiple (at least 2 but often 3) uses for each card, every card is worthwhile.

My biggest complaint is the card driven combat system. It's fun, especially the first few times, but optimal plays are usually easy to determine for an experienced player. Still though, combat is quick and has the right amount of luck.

[b]Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage[/b] [i]Mark Simmonovith 1996[/i]
Appart from Twilight Struggle, Hannibal is the only two players game in my collection. Reason is simple, with these two outstanding games I wont need any more in a while (given that many eurogames like Caylus or RftG work perfectly with two persons). Hannibal is a classic card driven game and probably it is the peak of the system. Battles dont use dice but a deck of combat cards, and movement and political control rules are easy to grasp, intelligent and fit perfectly with the theme. The new Valley Games mounted puzzle map is absolutely brilliant and the carthaginian dice add a very nice detail in such a neat edition. All in all, if you like two players complex games and the card driven mechanics this game will be a hit for you.

Purchased Christmas 2007.  Played once "solo" to get a hang of the rules and system (not very successfully).  Withholding a rating until I play it 'properly'.  Mar 2008 - played first 2-player game.  It was engrossing, confusing and at times frustrating.  But a good gaming experience.  I can see that it will take a few more plays to develope sound strategies, as both of us had our armies waffling around the board.  I imagine an experienced player will destroy the newbie (like Twilight Struggle).  But I believe it, like a fine wine, will getter better with age.  I'll begin at 8/10 being a bit generous and with the assumption that it will grow on me.
Jan 2010 - I've played this 6 times now and I'm still somewhat confused and feel that I don't quite get it.  I enjoy it, but it isn't nearly as engrossing as Twilight Struggle.  A single mistake can also be fatal.  Rating 7.4/10

Raised rating to a 7 after more familiarity.  The rules take some getting used to, but once they're digested the game is quite fun with lots of possible strategic options.  At a 6 for now, but could go lower.  More plays will tell.  I like the fact that there is a lot of strategic movement, few units and lots of map.  Though some feel the rules are well-written, I think there is still a lot of ambiguity, and this is backed up by the 11 pages of rules questions for the Hannibal forum here.

Raised rating to an 8 after more plays.

Raised to 9.  I still think the rules are have too much gray area, but the game is so good, that doesn't matter.

Newbie to the game, bought the Valley Games reprint.  

This is a great game - lots of difficult choices to make.  The learning curve for the rules isn't too bad if you're used to wargame-type rules layouts, and I suspect it's shorter than the learning curve for strategy.Although it's styled as being a wargame, at its heart, this is really an area-control game, pre-empting by some years the popularity of that game mechanic in eurogames.  Yes, there are wargame elements that you don't typically see in a euro, but these are simplified relative to the norm for wargames.  The dropping of a few elements here and there, and this wouldn't look too different from some of the more advanced euro-fare out there.The renewed availability of this game, and the wider forum offered by BGG compared to what was available when the game was first published, should produce some interesting cross-polination with other euro mechanics and I look forward to seeing HRVC feeding the development of some more sophisticated and engaging euros in years to come.

RATING: 6
I think it's been ten years since I last played this game, and while I was glad to get it back to the table, we were both a little disappointed. Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage was the first card-driven wargame that I played, and back in 1997 it blew me away. I loved facing difficult decisions with each play, I loved putting together a plan of action with each new hand, I loved how events were integrated into the game, I loved that a general could have the road wide open in front of him and yet still refuse to march. 

Now, years later, those virtues can be found in dozens of games, and so Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is left to be judged on it's few remaining unique points. There's the subject, which is marginally interesting to me, and there's a chassis that is for the most part clean and fast-moving. But for all that, the game feels a little too long for what it offers, and for a comparable investment in time, I think I'd rather play Twilight Struggle. I am also not fond of a situation that generally rewards nibbling at the edges over taking direct action against your enemy.

Not a bad game by any stretch -- but no longer the titan it seemed when card-driven wargames were the bold new thing in wargaming. I do regret that almost every game that followed Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage found it necessary to be longer, heavier, and more baroque than the original designs.

The Valley Games reprint is very handsome, but it goes a theme too far with that ridiculous Carthaginian die. I kept rolling "P."

RATING: 9.99999
This game is fantastic!

With that out of the way I'll list my perceived problems and suggested fixes.

1) Problem: Multiple  occurrences of "Messenger Intercepted" by the same player can be a game ender.

Fix: Make it an alternating Event, once played by either player it is not playable as the Event by that player unless and until the other has played it as the Event.

Rationale: Mostly pure game balance but how realistic is it for one side to repeatedly lose its messengers who always spill the beans?


2) Problem: The Double Envelopment Battle Card favours low ranked generals. It is much more advantageous for Varro to play DE against Hannibal than the other way around since Varro can expect to lose initiative anyway.

Fix: Auto loss of initiative due to play of "Double Envelopment" occurs against an equal or higher rated general; if DE is played against a lower rated general who matches the DE card the lower rated general must then roll to gain the initiative as for any other matched Battle Card. Consider "Double Envelopment" to represent any Surprise or Unorthodox tactic that would require an equally agile opposing general to qualify for an automatic counter.

Rationale: Hannibal's signature tactic (at Cannae against Varro) is a difficult and dangerous maneuver best left to the experts who also possess superior cavalry.


3) Problem: The Roman long term game strategy frequently hinges on holding out for Scipio Africanus to appear, often creating a "Fortress Italy" mindset.

Fix: Roll 1d6 each turn starting Turn 2 at which time a d6 of 1 brings on Africanus with 1CU; on turn 3 he shows up on a d6 of 1-2 with 2CU; turn 4 on 1-3 with 3 CU; turn 5 on 1-4 with 4CU; turn 6 and later on 1-5 with 5CUs. The catch? Africanus with attendant bonus CU/s must appear with any existing army or CU/s _outside_ Italy. The roll is only made if there is at least one army/CU eligible to receive him and if so the attempt is mandatory. Roman choice of placement if two or more eligible spaces exist. Think of "Africanus" as a leader who managed to rise to prominence through accomplishments and not necessarily the historical Africanus, the way a specific Roman leader is replaced with the same counter if he is killed in combat or by storms at sea.

Rationale: Roman predilection for augury notwithstanding, the Romans at the time did not know they had a guaranteed "1-4" Leader scheduled to appear on "Turn 6" of what they did not expect to be an agonisingly protracted war and could thus play for time by stalling with an oversize stack of CUs at Mutina.  Conversely, Carthage has the knowledge that Hannibal will not face his equal until late in the game allowing mid-game strategies rather than believing, as Hannibal did, that the path to victory lay in the quick kill which Hannibal had expected after the massacre at Cannae. The historical Hannibal couldn't count on the Roman Senate's dogged determination to run through all available dolts before being forced to trot out a Rockstar like Africanus. Like the Arnold Traitor card in We the People the current rule supplies fixed information about an unknown subject, the effects here being even more perniciously influential than in WtP.


4) Problem: Have the perfect card . . . but it's not effective in the current turn.

Fix: Allow players to withhold one card at the end of a turn, the following turn the hand is filled to normal capacity and ALL cards must be played. 

Rationale: Can be a help mostly for Carthage in the first couple of turns with cards that need to be used when Hannibal is in Italy. Establishing a foothold in Italy is crucial for Carthage unless opting for the Sicilian Offense.

YMMV

Deep, demanding, offering many possibilites.

I own the VG editions which - except for the illegible board (provinces, where are the provinces?) - is stunningly beautiful and of top-notch quality. The gameplay itself runs smoothly and rules are coherent and far from being convoluted. Rulebook is clearly written with plenty of examples.

Update 17th February 2010: the rate goes up from 8 to 9. Basically speaking, I really hate how random this game is, but I will be willing to play it any time. There are so many other aspects that I love, including maneuvering and interception, which enables player to create defensive strongholds over certain provinces, that my deep aversion for luck dependence, which is the drawback of all CDGs, is strongly surpassed.

I love this game, I repeat. If it wasn't to frustration two or three unlucky hands my cause, this would be a perfect 10. In the form as it is, it remains at 9. I would love to see this game refurbished, with improved mechanics.

6th April 2010: it is random, indeed, but careful hand management is also crucial. Additionally, few games can convey so much tension and replayability. Today I played my 9th game and found it to be my best game so far. Who knows how wonderful games await me in the future? Rating goes up to 10.

Valley Games edition.  Two F2F and a few solitaire outings did not impress as much as the hype implied.  Much of the strategy seemed to narrow down to a few titanic clashes between Hannibal and whatever Consul or Proconsul is available.

Wow, this was a surprise.  I was really expecting to like this game, but it more than fell flat.  The strategy seems scripted, with Carthage crossing the Alps on the attack and Rome turtling up waiting for Scipio Africanus.

The battle cards are silly (but no sillier than a CRT, really), and significantly increase the game's length.  The strategy cards are generic and gamey.  The political-influence subgame is clumsy and thematically unconvincing.  Each of these subgames feels almost but not entirely disconnected from the others.  Taken as a whole, the game gives one the distinctly unpleasant experience of playing three rather uninspired games at once.

The Valley Games production is beautiful, but has a few serious graphic-design flaws.

Onto the trade pile it goes...

I like card driven wargames. I understand that this is one of the early card driven classics. 

Each side plays very differently but the game is still finely balanced. It's fast moving. It's quite a brain burner - a well timed event card can be brutal. What I like about this game is that the advantage can shift quite swiftly from one side to another. As well as having strategy cards the game also has a card driven battle system that works and makes battles quite tense.

RATING: 9
A great game, deserving of the praise it gets.  The below comments were written at several different sittings.

This rating is (WAS) partially on potential, since the first time I played this, both of us were a little clueless on the strategy for the first turn or three, and it really effected the way the game went.  Rome was on the defensive for most of our game, and the Carthaginian player seemed to have luck on his side and things stayed that way through most of the game.  However, I can really see the potential as a sort of PoG light version.  This game packs a lot of the same punch that games like paths of glory and twilight struggle do, but can be played in less time and with a lot less complexity.  You get some of the same type of gripping decisions that PoG presents you with - fight hard on one front, or try to put the pressure on your opponent by fighting on multiple fronts, etc.  Quite a few times in our game well layed plans got screwed over by one general or another hopping on a boat and heading for an unguarded area of the board, prepared to lay political waste to the countryside or defeat smaller forces if left unchecked.

Strategy card draw effected the game, but luck there didn't seem too important.  The battle cards are a cute little mechanic, and add a real feeling of importance to every battle.  The allies rules seem to tilt things toward carthage a lot, but I think if the romans had been able to take a province in spain things would have been a little different.  

The production values are top notch, with my only complaint being that the dark colors of italy make the lines a little tough to see.  The dice and the chits are all great, and the board is beautiful.  I like the puzzle piece design on the board.  Mine was not warped at all.

Overall, I'm not sure where the rating on this one is going to settle.  I need to play it again to see if some of the negative things in the game were from us HRVC virgins making bonehead plays or if the game really has some little issues.  I think its probably more of the former.  


UPDATE:  I'm raising this up to a 9 from an 8.  The game seems to do a really good job of corralling non-historical decisions.  The rules seem to be geared toward this, but are not too blunt about it.  Its pretty damn clever and gives me new respect for the game.

2ND PLAY UPDATE:  Just played my second game of Hannibal.  This is a really great game.  This game was very close, until the last two turns when some bonehead plays by carthage (me) got some important armies SUNK, including Hannibal's.  You really need to develop a little lead on the Romans before Scipio Africanus shows up with his high ratings.  My first game, I took Hannibal with about 12 CUs into Italy and did very well.  This second game, I wrapped up northern spain faster so I took Hannibal over the alps with a only about 8 CUs instead of more.  I think in the long run this was a big mistake.  If Hannibal loses even one or two battles, he can really get screwed because of the reinforcement rates.  You need to wait and take Hannibal with a full complement into northern italy.  Hannibal with a full army will beat up on any of the non-africanus roman generals pretty consistently.  He can also do it fast enough to not take much attrition.  However, if you go in with less than a full force, Hannibal will be losing a man here and a man there and before too long you will take a big loss...  Not good!   

FINAL UPDATE: This is a fantastic masterpiece of asymetrical balance.

Mixed feelings about this one. The game mechanisms work well for the history depicted but there is a little too much incentive to cut off retreat paths creating all-or-nothing battles and the events that flip PC markers can be distracting.

The play duration is nice, plays easily in a single afternoon. The VG components are top notch.

RATING: 9
Beautiful game.
The cardmechanic shares many similiarities with other CDGs like We the people/Twilight Struggle/Paths of Glory etc. But where Twilight Struggle is only about area control via clever card play Hannibal incorporates armies, battles & sieges.
The two sides are quite asymetrical, Carthage having the advantage early on mainly because Hannibal can be activated by 1 OP cards & then Rome catching up with much more reinforcements & Scipio Africanus entering on turn 6.
One of the best ways to resolve battles i must say is this card-combat system, because it gives the player control.. something that dice do not, while keeping the tention very high!

The map & artwork is fantastic (except for the italian provinces, they're very hard to distinguish)

The game is a very long one.. we're talking 5-6 hours. But those were the days.. ;)

Hannibal is the direct offspring of the wonderful We the People, set in the 2nd Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage.

Both sides have some very definite advantages, which play well off each other: Carthage starts with all generals on the board, including the eponymous Hannibal, who does to Rome what Washington does to the British.

However, while both Rome and Carthage have access to Naval Movement, for Carthage it is often a real risk to attempt it, because of Roman Naval superiority.

Rome has a random draw of politically appointed Consuls plus one Proconsul appointment, so they are limited to three generals for much of the game, until Scipio Africanus enters to equalize the military leader balance.

The political control system is even better then in We the People, requiring force to help turn the PC tide once the base has been set, unless a helpful event comes along.

On the whole, events seem the favor Carthage, but many are not usable unless they are in a position to hold sway in Italy.

This all makes for a tight, well-balanced game.

I had an incredible ending to my first game, with both Carthage and Rome besieged simultaneously, Carthage ahead on Political points, and only Scipio's facility in siegecraft making the difference as Carthage fell in the final round.

I loved the game- I had suspected that I would, but it surpasses the earlier success of We the People with something even better.

I am starting this at an 8, and could easily see it rise from there. This is truly a classic game; if you love Twilight Sentinel, you owe it to yourself to look at its direct precursor.

Rating based on 1 play.  I really like this one.  It seems like it has a lot of complicated rules, but, it is actually pretty simple.  plays relatively quickly for a game of this type as well, once you have the rules ironed out.  We made a couple of mistakes, but nothing gamebreaking.  I tended, as Rome, to put too much stock in displomacy and converting cities rather than military conquest.  The Carthaginians were able to march over the Alps and siege Rome relatively easily due to my lackluster effort.  Sadly, one of the little rules i missed was that the game is over INSTANTLY if Rome is taken... I didn't fight as hard as I could have, thinking i had until the end of the year to retake Rome.  My plan was to let Hannibal wear himself out taking Rome, then march in and run him out quickly.  Sadly, once that token for Rome was flipped I realized my mistake.  Still, it was a tremendously fun game and 1 I am looking forward to getting on the table again very soon.  Really scratches that ancient warfare itch without being either overly complex, or overly simple.  Can't wait to get the Generals miniatures painted and on the board.

I like this game, especially now that I've got enough plays to understand the cards and map better. I'm a little concerned that Hannibal's move to Cisalpine is overly scripted. If he doesn't do that, what else can you do with him? As I play more I become less conservative in my use of Hannibal, though. In my most recent game he sat in Gaul for the first 3 turns before suddenly sailing to Italy with 10. You have to know the cards before you can take try that kind of thing.

Others hate the combat system but it doesn't bother me.

This is comfortably the best of the early CDGs, but even this early in the system's development the number of rules and playing time were already being stretched in comparison to We the People. This is an object lesson in offering a card deck that truly drives the game, it's the flow of events that really determines how the war plays out. Note that few cards are events in the historical sense, many are generic with titles like 'Diplomacy' or 'Storms at Sea', but they remain important in the context of the game. Carthage can be rather fragile, it's only real asset is Hannibal himself, but with only one route into Northern Italy and troublesome Naval Movement rules, Italy can be off-limits to Carthaginian armies leading to the game degenerating into the notorious 'sitzkrieg'. The events can help here, but Carthage in particular must play the hand it's dealt. The Carthaginian die is cool but not really practical (it's also incorrect as opposite faces don't add up to 7). This is one of the few single deck games that truly gives opportunities to both sides without luck overwhelming good play, but this remains a design that I respect rather than enjoy. A variant map is my preferred way to play.

Nicely designed game on the Second Punic War using the We the People system.  Simonitch has made some well-conceived changes to the system.  The more intuitive political isolation rules are particularly appreciated.  Still, compared to WtP, I remain unconvinced that the minor improvements in gameplay and historicity are worth the significant increases in complexity and gametime.  It doesn't help that I can't figure out how to play the Romans competently.

Lives up to the hype.

Very smart mechanics that do a terrific job of mimicking the dynamics of the 2nd Punic War.

It may be an odd analogy, but the conflict felt a bit like the American Civil War - Carthage (like the Confederacy) features superior military leadership, while Rome possesses better resources (manpower) and logistics via sea movement (like the Union).

RATING: 10
I never imagined I would be really interested in this game. It's a war game and a long game (not by war game standards). The games I really like are 1 hour long or less, any other game I own takes at most 1.5 hours. This one, I believe, takes 3+ hours for a full game when both players know the rules rather well (longer if they don't) and has many more rules than the typical games I like, but, the game is really really good.

At its essence it's a game of area control. Luckily for me, instead of moving 50 units of various types and upgrades, the movement is done only with generals of which each side has 4. The events and dual use of the cards make for fascinating decisions. The battles themselves are intense - much better than throwing dice. Still, the game is not about battles and typically is not full of fighting. It's about controlling areas, positioning to keep the enemy away, seizing opportunities and using events wisely. I am amazed at how well it captures the story and theme of the second Punic war. It is not historically accurate, but that's a good thing as that would make the game more tedious, in my opinion. Instead, it is inspired by a true story captured here in so many intricate aspects of the gameplay mechanics and design. Examples include the use of elephants in battle, double envelopment, unique strengths of the various generals, many of the special events, attrition, battle and political casualties, Rome building slowly with more reinforcements, while Carthage has the initiative and is on the offense from the start but lacks long term reinforcement capabilities.

All of this makes for an extraordinary game.

I am surprised to have found a game so worthy without really looking for one. Potentially a personal 10, but I need to play this more before I find out. I am eager to do so, but the length and complexity make it a difficult task.

It's elegant, it offers lots of decision making and the card-play for tactical battles is brillant, so much more fun than just rolling dice on a CRT. Takes severals plays to fully grasp the potential of cards and strategies, after that it is a very balanced game. As a simulation, it has its limits, as a game this one is superb.

RATING: 10
I love the way Hannibal RvsC's theme combines military with political aspects and the way the mechanics mix on-map counter movement with card play. The constant need to decide whether to use the strategy cards as events, to place PC markers or to move generals produces a tense game. Even the use of battle cards, while still an abstraction and not entirely satisfactory, is novel and gives a feeling of tactical control that is entirely absent in the more usual resolution of battles using dice rolls. Furthermore, Hannibal always plays out over the course of the game in such a way that both players are fully involved. If one player gains a major advantage then the game will probably end quickly. But if the advantage is minor then a win can never be guaranteed until the last moment.

I really appreciate the effort and design.

But, sadly, the game is undertested.  It always falls into the same tracks, there are always the same theaters of war (while others are always inactive), there are always the same events on cards impossible to use and there is always disturbingly repetitive state regarding the number and the ownership of the controlled provinces (the balance in the number of them controlled by both sides is very hard to break).  The full potential of the game (which is vast) remains unexploited... :(

'Successors' is much more dynamic, unpredictable, fun and fulfilling game...

Looking VERY forward to this one...

Well an update at last. Finally got to play after 7 years of waiting and you know what, it lived up to its reputation!  TG

Needless to say, this is the shit. The highest I think I have ever rated a game after one play, usually 8.5 is my limit but I got a really good feel for this after just one play and it presses all the right buttons for me including long term planning amongst many other cool things. Not trying to be a wargame like many AC games do with a war theme, this is a wargame (somewhat of a sim too) where units and leaders are moving into other territories (can use the sea too) and causing havoc and having battles where damage is dealt out and retreats happen too, there is an AC aspect here also though. TS borrowed heavily here using the very same card system but left out some of the true war aspects which I really missed. 

The battle card system, well, lots has been said already. For me, better than dice (and a little like Taj Mahal actually) but still random mostly no doubt and you do roll for initiative which is quite important. You do get more cards for having more units though so this helps to give a stronger force a better chance of winning and often damage isn't too bad for a losing force but tables can turn either way for sure. It IS fun however and I like the way initiative changes hands and rolling under your leader determines this, very cool and makes the better leaders very important. Also the double surround card gives a bonus to damage but is risky to play because you can lose the initiative, liked that too. Rolling for the damage though with the +2 extra damage added, yikes, that can really break you since its possible to lose ALL your forces, a little harsh but then, so was war I suppose, and this wont happen too often (at least I think and hope!). Overall I think I like the card system mostly and also the combat system as a whole and MUCH better than just dice rolls for me. I also like the options you have too, got crappy cards, maybe you try to withdrawl from the combat and try your luck another day; don't want to fight at all, try and avoid the combat altogether, options are always good.  

Only played once but it seems like the overall luck in the game is in check here (unlike many wargames) and equally important is that you have many options on how to do things. There aren't any really big blows that will ruin you (except maybe losing all in a battle which will definitely sting and the sea can be harsh too but you know this and can avoid it when its too risky until later events make it more favourable) and mostly it seemed pretty balanced too. For sure the luck bothered me a little more in TS as a comparison (coup and realign rolls) but I have played that 6 times now and this once so we'll just have to see how this holds up with more play, I'm pretty confident though. I seen some small things that could maybe use a little tweaking and I see now Charles has already addressed some of these to his liking like seiges being pretty tough and cities not quite important enough to name a couple, lets see if after a few more games I also go down the tweaking road.    

Rating could go up but I dont know this is high for me, I'm certain it won't go below a 9 for sure, probably settle at 9.5 but it could just make a 10. (maybe just a small tweak here or there ....LOL) 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] - Well halfway through another game and I wonder if the cards arent going in Hannibals favour how much harder it makes it for him. I do have to say that so far I find the strategy opaque which is not at all typical for me so maybe I'm not the best judge of it right now but it seems that to give Hannibal a chance to be a pest in Italy you do need some cards.

Overall luck is definitely not LOW but I dont think its too high either, [i]maybe[/i] for the length of the game though which is maybe the bigger issue, it can go 4 hours no problem or longer in your first games. I might cut a round out or two at least until games go faster from more experience.  

I do think seiges need the tweak too, 2 instead of 3 for non-critical cities to make then a touch easier and to make them a little more tempting a small bonus for conquering like a free CU and a free flip of an adjacent PC seems fair. I also tweaked the retreat table so that you only lose the whole force if you roll an "8" (adjusted 6). Rating likely to stay where it is for good, its a fun strategic game that plays out history well

I don't like it quite as much as WILDERNESS WAR, and the history is both looser and more bland than WW, but HANNIBAL is still near the top of my card-driven wargame list.  It's quick-playing, exciting, and has fair historical flavor.

The Valley version is better than the Avalon Hill version in every way except the map, which is much harder to read - but that's critical and makes the game harder to play for no apparent reason.

Valley Games edition. Great box, good and attractive rules, the puzzle-board is great and gets you a hgh-quality board without the usual hazards of puzzle-boards.

Struggled through a learning game. Seems like potential is there for great gameplay, if you can get through 4 or 5 games--a real time investment dilemma. Awesome theme and board. Loved the strategy cards, hated the battle cards--way too much effort for the payoff. The board (VG) is cool and the dice didn't bother me--they usually don't in a war game.  

My rating is a compromise between how much I actually want to play it, a 6--'if in the right mood'-- and how well-designed I think the game is--an 8. This rating could certainly rise if I get over the learning hump and have opportunities to play it. But for now it's a game better in theory than actually spent playing.

Classic wargame covering the 2nd Punic War. The game was the second card-driven game to be published, following Avalon Hill/Mark Herman's groundbreaking We The People.

Hannibal adds a slight amount of complexity to its predecessor, but stays elegant and quick-playing.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2010)

One of the first games I really disliked when I played it for the first time. I played it on 2010 and in that year, I liked every game I played (because I was new to the hobby).

I honestly don’t remember much about the game. I remember it was a card driven game. I remember it took a long time to play it, in fact I was so bored by it that I, purposely, let Carthage fell so the game could finish, otherwise the game could have lasted  for another couple of hours, never again!!!

Since that incident, I have learned that I’m not a wargamer, I actively dislike most wargames I have played, so I have no desire whatsoever to play Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage again.

Current Rating: 3.5

RATING: 9
Probably the high water mark for CDWGs.  Its fairly simple yet allowing for viable replay and subtle advantage for extended play.  The new Valley Games production is top-notch.  The much criticized Battle Card system works well for the period and gives a nice feel for an escalating military engagement.  The alternative would be a d6 on a CRT and would not work as well.  Basically, its a simple minigame with significant tension that rewards larger armies but provides enough information to allow strategic withdrawals.

RATING: 8
I like the deck composition and the reduced variance in Ops values compared to Twilight Struggle. (TS cards range from 1-4, Hannibal cards from 1-3.) There are good hands and bad hands in Hannibal but even on a "bad" turn I never really felt screwed by my card selection.

The political control mechanic is a thematic way to simulate the effects of military conquest. It feels a little gamey in the application to the barbarian lands of France though. I suppose it's necessary for game balance but those "meaningless" PC markers are placed and retracted so quickly I have trouble making it work in my mind. This is just a quibble, as the game in general is very thematically immersive.

Nowhere is this better done than in the implementation of the generals. Hannibal is well represented as an absolute terror, capable of inflicting ruinous losses on Rome even with the odds against him.

I've decided to rate Hannibal a 9. There's so much tension in the game that I can't really see myself playing too often; usually I enjoy a mellower gaming experience. But when I'm in the mood to ratchet it up a bit, Hannibal will be on my short list.

Hannibal is a wonderfully rich game of strategy, tactics, skirmishes, and diplomacy. The depth and attention to detail here are staggering. The card-driven system provides​ both players a multitude of options each turn. The historical flavor shines through brilliantly with several astute design choices (e.g., the constant shifting of Roman consuls, Carthaginian naval inferiority, etc.), allowing the players to feel immersed in the time period. Chance is a major factor, so learning to naviagte risk and mitigate the random elements in your favor is part of the challenge and beauty of the game. A monumental achievement in the political/war genre.

RATING: 8
For the most part, it's extravagantly, sinfully well-produced. I've come to dislike the map though--it's just so busy, and in places like southern Italy it's tough to distinguish province borders from the point-to-point connections. On top of that, new players are bamboozled by which provinces are politically significant and which aren't, because the map doesn't assist in any way. The rulebook unfortunately contains a host of sloppy typographical errors (par for the course from Valley Games) and is near useless for actually learning the game due to brain-dead organization. There are also some Strategy Cards with lazy typos. 

Keep a close eye on your armies as they gear up for a battle--if you don't have friendly PCs to fall back to in the event of a defeat, the effects are [b]brutal[/b]. This is a pretty tough game to teach because there are just so many little rules that have a procedure of their own: avoid battle, interception, withdrawal, elephant charges, retreat, etc.

I'm not into military games. However I did like the game mechanic used in this game which is card play. And it seemed like something a war game player would enjoy. That said it wasn't able to turn me onto war games and therefore my rating.

RATING: 6.5
This game tells a great narrative about the second Punic war. It has a steep learning curve and will require a learning game. Hang on, because eventually this games rewards you with flavorful stories and after every game you ponder what you've could have done different or better. For me that's a sign of a good game.   

However I do find the game length disproportionately long given the amount of luck in drawing of strategy cards, battle cards and dice results as seen for example on the retreat table. Graphically the second edition map could've been more clearer regarding the province roads and borders in Italy. There's a hefty amount of rules that add realism but complicate the game. The rule book did a bad job at explaining. For example: converting PC markers enlisted as an 'exception' in the bits & odds in chapter 19.2, really?

RATING: 9
This is an epic game of tense, asymmetrical conflict. Hannibal acts as the MVP for Carthage, and can smash into Italy in the early game. However, Rome shines in the long-run, rallying reinforcements at a faster rate. This means that Hannibal becomes more of a roaming, opportunistic warlord as the game goes on, unable to complete the conquest but very difficult for the Romans to defeat decisively. It's a cool trade-off that presents each side with a different set of challenges. I'll have to play more to assess the subtleties of the event cards, but so far the deck impresses. Recommended for anyone who has 3-4 hours and wants to give CDGs a try. Oh, and it's gorgeous.

Very impressed with this design.  The choices presented by the cards feel appropriate for the period while simultaneously creating a depth to the gameplay - part of what the Romans are trying to do in the early game is to find *some* way to turn the Carthaginians away from their attack on Italy.  The battle cards actually work reasonably well - they impart a narrative to the engagements while the counterattack mechanism takes into account the relative skills of the commanders, giving the feeling that the better general gets his chance to shine.

I've played this about 6 times, but in a  every-other-month, distracted-Dads kind of way.  My opponent is a Rome freak ("SQPR" tattoo on his ankle), so I almost always play Carthage.

I love the way this game punishes sloppy play, especially for Carthage.  That feels authentic.  The risk for Carthgage of being lost at Sea is very sobering, as is the problem of supply.

I learned quickly that getting Hannibal across the Alps is only the beginning -- the real question is, can you keep him supplied with soldiers, while the Romans bring their superior regenerative ability to bear?

Unfortunately, the answer to that question for me has been "no."  Every time I invade Italy, I lose.  Every time I pick a smaller battle -- for Sardinia and Corsica, or for Sicilia -- I have much better results.

UPDATE 5/06: I finally managed a successful invasion on Italy -- what a rush!  It came down to one thrilling battle as my Hannibal attempted to cross from northern to southern Italy to receive reinforcements.  Memorable.

I bought this and Washington's War at the same time and they are basically the same design.  My favorite genre of games is the CDG and this game is another example of why.  You have to make tough choices to play more powerful event cards for the more powerful op points or vice versa.  The combat is quite a unique system where you draw a certain # of battle cards based on certain strengths in battle (units, generals, controlled areas, strateg cards, etc) and then play cards in sequence with an attempt to match your opponents cards.  Initiative in battle is absolutely key as you can only win a battle if you have the initiative.  So generals with low ratings can be quite a liability.  The game is extremely tactical and units are in very short supply so decisions need to be made very carefully.

Valley Games Reprint (2007): The typos were annoying, especially the one on the map board itself. Some of the design decisions were also questionable. However, the fact that Hannibal is in my hands *right now* and not sitting in my wishlist next to other OOP titles that are out of my price range on eBay helps alleviate most of the bad feelings brought on by the former.

The game itself is wonderful, especially if you enjoy the period it covers. The system does a fine job of modeling various aspects, from Rome's superior navy, to the fickle whims of the Senate fearing the very men they charged with defending Rome and all the other juicy bits in between like elephant charges, brutal sieges, withering attrition, and opportunistic allies. The nice thing is that the chrome isn't overdone. Just the right amount to allow me to feel I'm really marching some elephants over the alps into the maw of the waiting Roman legions.

The game is a bit complex, as it shares many traits with the typical wargame. However, the investment is worth it if you're looking for a game that'll consume 2 to 4 hours of your life without you even noticing. Once you play your first game everything should click into place. If you've played wargames before, this will be a breeze. If you've played a MB GameMaster game like Axis and Allies, this will be a bigger bite than you're used to, but not much, and the flavor is totally worth it.

The luck in the game is from the luck of the draw and the luck of the die roll. While there is the chance you can get some crummy hands, no single hand should totally devastate a player unless they're already in a situation where even a good hand would still make them sweat. The decisions you can make each turn not only levels out the luck typically, but also lends to the feeling that while you cannot control history, you can at least try to direct its turbulent nature to do your bidding

Right now I'm giving this game a 10. The game length and number of players will always be a limiting factor of how often it will hit the table, but when given the chance I'll try to make sure and see that it does.

Only played once so far. I was Hannibal, and I managed to haul ass through the Alps and invade Italy on the first round. After a failed campaign in Sicilia and a disasterous attrition roll on what would have been my final foray with elephants across the Alps, I managed to get Hannibal killed (er, sorry, "displaced") just before Scipio Africanus would have shown up. What concerns me most about this game is that I think it leads you by the nose a little bit. I'm not sure how much strategic flexibility there is when it the naval roll modifiers so carefully guide you to take over Sicily while mounting a campaign out of Cisalpinia. It's a lot of fun; an elegant, simple system, with a battle card mechanic that spares us the tedium of too much hand management. I'd love to give it an 8 or 9, but I'd need to see how it shakes out over multiple plays. This game should also get a shout-out for its stunning map, and simple, illustrative art. The generals have unique advantages that do a great job of giving each a distinct personality.

RATING: 8.5
Good game - but I am missing some "wow" factor. It feels little bit longer and more random than I would like. 

But I absolutely love combat system. It provides little bit more control than just rolling dice and also provides some strategies like prolonging battles to cause more casualties, etc. So definitely it prolongs whole game but it was very fun and rewarding, much more than rest of game.

For negatives I do not enjoy much these flagging games (your general is in Spain but you are flagging Corsica and Africa) it just feels weird to me.

Very good single-deck CDG.  Well balanced and tense, with many decisions to make.  I'd prefer to use a combat results table to resolve battles, as the Battle Card battles take some time to resolve, and don't really add a whole lot to the game.  Lots of different strategies to pursue, and will take some time to realize which ones are effective and become competitive at this game.  However, I'm just not that interested in the subject matter, and would prefer to play other CDGs instead of this one.

An excellent card driven wargame on the topic. That portrays the swings of fate, and the flow of campaign pretty well. And it is a blast of a game too. It is far more lighter than Paths of Glory which I played first, but it scratches the same itch. And I don't have a headache after a game of Hannibal as opposed to a game of Paths of Glory, and it plays out faster too. So if I have to choose between the two, I will rather play Hannibal.

This one is no longer with me, but went to a friend as a gift on his 40th birthday.

I'm going to miss having it myself, though. 

Happily I still know at least three other owners, so this is still going to get played, I'm sure.

Extraordinario wargame con unos componentes sobresalientes: desde la caja y el precioso tablero que se monta como un puzle, pasando por los gruesos counters, hasta los generales montados en sus peanas. Funciona con un motor de cartas que permite muchas posibilidades estratégicas, a la par que los acontecimientos le dan sabor al juego. El sistema de combate (consistente en ir igualando cada carta que juega el contrario hasta que uno no lo consigue) es ingenioso y muy emocionante. Aparentemente complicado tras la lectura de las reglas, el juego resulta muy fluido a medida que transcurre la partida. Un must have, sin duda.

RATING: 5
At the beginning I have been fascinated with this game giving strong 8 and thinking about 9. It has a complex, but well designed rules. Game components quality is very high as well. 

When playing first time it gives great pleasure. You have a feeling that you are commanding great ancient army and the outcome of the war depends on you.

After next few games I have a feeling that this game is not about taking continuous advantage and winning at the final. It is only about making good use of cards you have. Your ideas have almost no impact on the game flow. Just the cards you and your opponent draw are important.

Mainly cards and dice rolls are changing the game, not player actions. You simple have a luck or not. The game is much too long for this. You could get your cards for the turn and know that that are poor, so next 30 min - 1h you have to watch what your opponent does. Even worse, after half of the game you can know that probably you lost but you have to play to the end next 3 hours...

This game excellently simulates the war - unpredictable events can change advantage to disadvantage or won battle to lost. But playing the board game is not entirely about simulation, it's also about fun and, in my opinion, reasonable awarding good decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a really impressive CDG, unlike other games in its genre the rules are solid and without any pointless chrome, the cards are all reasonably balanced (as in there aren't many which you will never ever see played as an event) and the playing time is reasonable. 
The political game is what makes this brilliant. The end of year political control check maintains a high level of tension from beginning to end and the political penalty for losing battles is also excellent.

The tension in Hannibal still has nothing on that found in Paths of Glory though, which I find to be more exciting and satisfying overall. If you Like Hannibal and can find time for a 8-10 hour game, be sure to give Paths of Glory a go!

Played the Valley Games reprint. Excellent production value, counters, cards. Game plays quickly with minimum of fuss and offers a fair variety of strategic options; more than Wilderness War but less than some other CDGs. I enjoy the "controversial" card-based combat system. Why don't I own this? I have strategic CDGs that are more interesting to me. Still a good game!

The early CDG classic is still a great light wargame. The card driven battle system provides an extra tactical layer and doesn't prolong the game too much.
Battle casualties can be brutal also on the winner and in some extreme cases feel too random but usually it's a minor problem. I'd really like to see the battle resolution implemented in other, upcoming games.

6 may seem a low rating for a game of its calibre but for me I found it too long. The game consisted of much to-ing and fro-ing with both players countering what the other had done the turn before, the only real gains were when one player had a good hand of cards, so for me it seemed that luck rather than player skill drove the game. The rules took a long time to sort out (1st edition) and we were three turns in before we had covered everything, now I realise that in comparison to a lot of AH games the rules are not that complex, but they were not easy either. What got me was that as a learning game we had only completed 5 turns after 5 hours play - far too long for what I was getting out of it. I will give it another go now I have the rules sorted out - but still have reservations.

Played once.  Hmmm...  It's hard for me to impartially evaluate a game I win the first time.  So, I'm not sure what I think of this game.  It was fun, for the most part, but frustrating, unbalanced, and overly influenced by luck at times.  Twice in my first game I was in a position that should've ultimately ended in failure, only for lady luck to aid me (for once, er, twice).  I must play it at least once more, with a better understanding of the game, before I can really know what I think of it.

While the game is fairly straightforward in gameplay, it doesn't really flow for me like Twilight Struggle does.  The action seems very disjointed.  I cannot decide if I like the battlecard system or hate it although it can certainly provide for some surprising and unexpected results from time to time.  The naval superiority of the Romans is quite frustrating as Hannibal (which I assume was probably reflective of reality as well!).

I have long heard this game praised as the best card driven war game. As far as my limited experience goes, I can say that I agree.  It manages to provide an abundance of period flavor while still retaining an elegant system.  I personally like the battle card system very much as it seems to lend the game a little more tension compared to the typical roll your dice and check the CRT format.  Tension, agonizingly difficult decisions, historical flavor and the ability to control well-balanced asymmetrical powers, this game falls nicely into my wargaming sweet spot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Much has been said about this game and looks like it is not a hype.  I missed the game when it was available because of the unfamilarity about the Roman history at the time.  Many ancient games followed and I was exposed more to the period and my interest about this game grew.  Some key concepts are demonstrated in ancient warfare: walled cities and sieges, leadership (movement with the use of cards), tribes and revolts, naval movement and even political control (which is a deciding factor to the victory conditions).  The game possesses a tense (albeit unrealistic) combat system while both sides try drawing out opponent's hand of battle cards.  Results of the battle was scaled back into historical ends according to the number of cards played, meaning even you and your opponent play out all your cards (up to 20 rounds, one card one round) in extended number of rounds, you could still loose only 2 to 3 strength points.  Imagine how impossible an ancient army can change from frontal assault to a left or right flank in an instant.  The avoidance before combat, withdrawals during the combat, displacements of generals and combat units, interception and political control modelling makes this a fluid and interactive game. The timing to come to a battle has never been more important in this game.  You can be on the strategic offensive in one year, and on a defensive one next year.  Hannibal really tests your generalship of what and where to go in a suitable timing to the fullest extent.  The second edition has a substantial update and clarification than the first one.  It shows how many possibilities that this game could have offered which cannot be covered completely by the original rulebook.  I am a little suprised by the popular reception of this game as the game is very abstract to a high degree to most non-wargamers.  Nonetheless, the game mechanics accomodate a lot of the complex operations and concept in a very efficient way.  Every time I play, I have a good feeling about it - a sense of academic accompolishment.  The system is a little bit on the gamey side, but yet it draws you to deep thinking about what the war was about in ancient time.  It proves to be yet another success from Mark Simonitch. A very tense but fun game which, after all, reflects the historically manuveoring tactics adopted by both sides.  A highly recommended item. Valley Games edition in June 06 $65.

I really like the Battlecard system.  I'm glad they are not pervasive, but they are a nice change.   It allows for some strategy during a battle...to fight for a couple turns and withdraw rather than being crushed in a retreat.   or bluffing about which cards you have.

An asymmetric card driven war game pitting Hannibal against Rome in the Punic War.  This is a magnificent game and other than the length and the learning curve involved, I would rate it much higher.  It has a very clever battle mechanic where you play a card that must be matched by the opponent. 

Cards can be used for operations points, events or in some cases reinforcements.  I really enjoy the game.

Best of the card-driven games.  Has a bit of a steep learning curve, both as to fiddly rules and less than intuitive strategies.  Worth the investment to learn, though, as it is a well-balanced game with a great historical feel to the play.  I can see why it (and WtP from which it was derived) has spawned a host of imitators.

[Played 7 times]
It's long, complex (several rules and exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions...) and involving a lot of luck (dice and cards), but also some strategy and some tactic.
The ebb-and-flow of luck grants the possibility to recover, but also reduces the rewards for skillful play.
Since it's for 2 players, it hasn't two of the worst flaws of all wargames: player elimination and coalition against someone (the leader, the weakest, the unlucky...).
In the end, it requires too much time (to learn it and then play it) for an outcome so heavily affected by luck.

Decent game. After playing I found myself dwelling on different strategies I could have used which tells me I can easily play this game again. 

EDIT: Second game and it seems to me that the game really revolves around the political control. Without attention to this aspect, the game quickly falls away from you. Military movement and battles shouldn't be taken lightly and you need to plan out a good strategy for the round with the strategy cards your're given, since that draw can unlock a great opening. If you begin falling behind on political control, it will quickly consume all you efforts and make for a long game.

RATING: 6
Rating based on 2 players.

This game lies right on the edge of the amount of complexity I can handle somewhat comfortably (though still a bit incompetently at first). For my tastes, there are too many modifiers, small rules, and exceptions; however, all these rules do make sense thematically, and while there is a number of small chits to move around I would say the game doesn't feel fiddly overall. 

My favourite part of this game is definitely the battling system which uses Battle Cards, the number of which you receive is based on your army strength + modifiers, and which you must use to match your opponent's attack before you have a chance to roll for initiative and make your own attack. It's a fun way to give someone a definite advantage while still allowing for lucky escapes and mild strategy, and is more exciting than simple dice rolls. It also increases the flavour of the theme, as more powerful generals can gain the upper hand even if they have a much smaller army. I don't think this would work in a game with more players as it would result in a lot of downtime for non-battlers (like in Titan), but it works very nicely for a 2-player game.

RATING: 9
Just brilliant!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What this game is good at is generating tension: the battle card system in particular can be absolutely excruciating, and general card play forces you into tough choices between competing priorities. It also enjoys the distinction of being one of the few conflict games I've come across in which you can properly attempt to bluff through your play choices and not just through banter. It does, however have a number of downsides. The rules complexity is a bit of a nightmare IMO, pushing the limit of what I'd consider realistically playable. The game also seems very capricious - a single event card or die roll can sometimes effectively decide the entire game and it generally seems subject to the whims of fate more often that the heavyweight rules and analysis can carry. In summary, when it works it's excellent and when it doesn't it can be rather dull, and it fails to work properly during a significant minority of plays.

I heard the hype, I bought the game, I played it...and wasn't impressed. For whatever reason the PC-marker system doesn't really work for me, and I found the combat card system to be creative but unfulfilling. Ultimately, the game I played wasn't great, and didn't feel much like a Roman/Carthaginian war. I'll reserve the right to change this rating later, but it's unlikely I'll play the game again any time soon.

Love the deapth and strategy level in this game. Despite the fact, that you have one static map, you have bunch of difficult and hard decisions to make within the game. This leads to great repleyability. 

I also enjoy the asimetrical nature of the game, because it really feels different to play with Rome than it is with Carthag.

Only two negatives, are the fact that game takes around 3 hours to play, and because of that wont hit my table too often, but still I will enjoy when it does!

Second drawback is the rules, because the main mechanics are simple, but there are billion tiny rules which we should remember and are really used in really specific moments. 

I am not a war gamer, nether my girlfriend is, but after second play we managed to learn most of the rules and enjoy the game. 

However, historical flavor is amazing!

Great system that stood the test of time. Owning the German version from Jeux descartes, I like the "old" map better than the new edition. The flow of the game is smooth, the mechanics soon become second nature. Great game for both the newbie and the seasoned veteran. 
The combat cards can make a battle very uncertain - if you don't have the right cards, it's over. But such is life and battle. Thumbs up from me.

Too easy for the Romans to win, just keep throwing everything at Hannibal & more often than not, you will win by attrition, which is kind of what happened anyway, so maybe in 10% of the alternate universes, Hannibal wins.

Excellent game, lots of back and forth with some good tension and variety of options.  The card-driven combat takes some getting used to.  I discover new, exciting things about the game every time I play.  I note the 2nd edition rules made a real change in winning conditions, especially regarding the defeat of Hannibal.  Are the 2nd edition rules much better?

8/2015: a wild game against Bartel.  He had Hannibal on the ropes three times but ech time I escaped with a lot of luck.  Finally, to deflect attention from rapidly declining Italy he went for Carthage but an eleventh hour return by Hasdrubal to help Hannibal killed Scipio, and Rome surrendered on turn 8.  What a great game that has held up for such a long time!  I guess Boldo of Rochester was right when he encouraged me to but it all those years ago.

The Valley Games edition is a decent effort, but is unfortunately marred by some poor graphic design choices, thus I'm rating the VG edition 1 point less.

I'd go with the AH edition (just download 2nd edition rules).

This game is a blast. Clear rules with no chrome, easy to get and to play. A match can last a few hours, but it is worth every minute. This is lived history, the Carthagians (with their elephants) with their top leader Hannibal try to infiltrate Italian, and the Romans with the options to exhaust Hannibal with their armies or to go for counterattacks in Spain or Africa. Very good in all aspects (board, cards, gameplay...). Really everyone should have this!

Some of the shine is off this one - but my rating for it is pivoting between 7 and 8 depending on how much I enjoyed my most recent game. Maybe I should rate it 7.5 but I don't do things by halves. It's a great system but if you get caught on the hop it snowballs in a hurry and can be very hard to recover. The game is a lot of fun if both sides keep it close, but if either of you are up by 3 or so provinces in a turn, you will have a hard job coming back from that. When it plays close, you can see why it's a classic, but that only seems to about 50% of the time in my experience so far.

I wanted to like this one, I really did. I overpaid for it, poured over the BGG entries, gave it multiple tries, but...just too many "Well if you do this, then look at this modifier and add this other modifier and WAIT, you have this card so that modifier is null..." and so on and so forth. Life's too short, in my humble gaming view.

So far this CDG beats Wilderness War and Washingtons War, which share similar mechanics but the battle mechanism really puts this one over the top for me. Every game has always been tight at one point during play where either power was in a position to pull off the victory.

Clunky combat overshadows an very interesting and unique wargame. I love the theme and how games play out. However, combat is based around a weird card mechanic and there are a few too many "reference tables". Board regions can be tough to make out.

RATING: 8.5
After reading the reviews on this one, it became a buy-before-play game (which I usually don't do).  And I am very happy with my decision.  Hannibal plays smooth, and relatively fast.  It requires a reasonable amount of planning and thought - more on turn-by-turn basis I think, rather than a whole-game strategy (much of one's play is in reaction to your opponents play - much more so than in many wargames.  You'll see what I mean when you play).  THis is ok though.  Also, this game really fills a nitch.  It is fairly deep in analysis and planning, but is playable in ~3-5 hours.  This is rare for a wargame, expecially for one that is as entertaining as Hannibal.  The only real downside is the randomness associated with the fact that it is a CDG.  So far it really hasn't been an issue (in my 4 plays), but it certainly could be.  We made a house rule allowing for re-draws if a player gets 4 or more 1's in his hand - and this seems to work well (I know, it's not perfect, but it beats having a shit-hand, and being able to do next to nothing for a full turn). 
Any gamer who likes CDGs should give this game a try.

RATING: 10
Having taken college Latin and being a history junkie, I can say that this game perfectly captures the flavor of the times. From the consul selection mechanisms, to the slow but steady Fabius, to the tribal subjugation and sieges, the game has most everything one would want. 

Mechanics-wise, the game is very easy to learn and teach, even to people who are not wargamers. The battles are tense, since the outcomes can be very variable - just like what actually happened!

The better player, if they get 'normal' cards + rolls, can probably win this game 80+% of the time.  Of course, you can get hosed with bad consul pulls/retreat roles/events, but similar to poker the best players can control their luck enough of the time that at WBC the best players often end up with at least 3+ wins.

If there is any criticism I might have of the game, it's that depending on the situation there can be a severe slowdown of the game on turn 7+. If lots of armies are on the board and italy/spain/africa are locked down, it will be almost impossible for either side to break through, and the fighting will center on one particular province (corsica usually). This leads to a tiresome and predictable 3 turns, and often whoever gets better campaign cards can sail enough troops to take/hold the province on turn 9.

The battle cards also make the game interesting, but I often wonder if smaller battles should have a simpler resolution mechanism to make the game a bit shorter.  Something like a die chart for battles where the card ratio would be 3:1 or more, with attacker/general bonuses factored in. But honestly, this is very nitpicky. If the player whose attack it was shuffles the deck immediately afterwards, it can move along very quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fantasic integration of theme and mechanics - with enough chrome to make things have a narrative arc, but enough abstraction to make choices have profound tactical and strategic implications. Our first game came literally down to the roll of a die.

I almost like this more than Twilight Struggle (and I definitely prefer the Ancient Rome theme!), and can definitely see it as the forefather of the more recent CDG's.

A quick pace, lots of historical flavour, plenty of strategic and tactical options finished with a healthy dose of chance.  The game seems to be really well balanced, with Carthage initially on the front foot (Hannibal's strength) and Rome on the ropes but recruiting troops more readily than Carthage - can Rome hold out long enough?   Looking forward to playing again soon.

RATING: 9
One of the first CDG (Card Driven) wargames, quite unique back then (1996) - We the People hit the market only 2 years before.
Just read the cards (simple, to-the-point instructions), then plan your actions and try to win the 2nd punic war either with military or political pushes. 

A very unique design, combat isn't dice-based instead you have a card minigame, where players use a dedicated deck to outsmart the opponent. This is a very clever twist that impressed its mark in other non-wargames too (like Middle-earth Quest).

Love to fight out battles with another mini-card game, this is the last of the CDW's that plays that way.  Great historical and ahistorical outcomes depending on how you strategize.

I got the game 3 days short of 9 months after i was charged.  Oh, and they never sent the generals!  ***  Updated:  valley games has the nerve to spam me for their preorder of hamilcar expansion.

(Valley Games reprint) Great components (the only problem is that the provinces in Italy are a bit hard to distinguish on the map, but that doesn't matter after a couple of games), clean rules that focus on the important stuff (the original 2nd edition rules don't show any signs of age), and wide open gameplay (there never seems to be an obviously best course of action). Also, the events don't appear to dominate the game as in some other CCGs. Very glad I got this one.

A great game I've enjoyed many plays of, but which nevertheless has some issues for  me. I really enjoyed the card-driven nature of it, but on balance I found that the cards actually drove the game too much - often victory at the end of a close-matched game came down to who got the right 'gotcha' card in the last turn, to steal that vital region from the other player. 

Don't get me wrong, I've had a lot of fun with this one (hence the high rating). I've just started to feel that the effects of strategic play is a little outweighed by the effects of the cards.

A wargame that is accessible by euro-standard. If you take the combat out, the rest of the game will roughly form a card-driven area majority game with a twist.

You get to remember and discuss the course of the game.

RATING: 7
Fast moving, area control, wargame, which I should love, but find a little disappointing. Firstly I'm not a fan of the battle card system, but the real deal breaker is the game balance, where an early swing in political control can really unbalance the game. If the luck is fairly even then the game can go down to the wire (which makes for an awesome game), but it seems more often the game will be decided in the first couple of turns by a lucky card draw, unlucky dice roll or maybe the outcome of the battle. Forgiveable in a quicker game, but for something with this amount of depth I'm more likely to pass over this for something more dependable. The Valley Games version is really beautiful and wonderfully produced.

This reminds me of another GMT production: Mark Herman's "Washington's War," in that both games are designed by talented, clever people, but published by different game companies that in both cases produced rulebooks that are so badly written and especially, organized, that they make the games significantly harder to learn than they should be. 

With "Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage," if you're going to get this game you'd better be ready to commit much energy to learning the rules (lots of information to absorb, and, in my case, rewriting and reorganizing them) and in particular, playing the game repeatedly in order to see how it's really supposed to play and to figure out strategies. 

In my opinion, that's a significant, long-term commitment. This is a perfect example of how NOT to write a rulebook and why rules should be written conversationally--albeit precisely--as though explaining the game to one person. It's just a RULEBOOK--not a sociological treatise. From what I've read, the rulebook for this former Avalon-Hill title wasn't rewritten much from the original, and it shows. The best thing about the rulebook for this game is that Valley Games used 1 1/2 spaces between lines, which gives me room to interject plain English. 

Also, the organization is abysmmal: I count 65 instances of cross-references that require jumping at least one page to find--and not once, in either direction, frontward or backward, is there a reference to which page. Plus, the rulebook was poorly proofread, with typos and mistakes throughout--more mistakes the more I look at it closely. 

This is completely aside from the game design itself, which is obviously outstanding. And the rules themselves aren't that difficult to understand--it's just that there is a lot to keep in mind, and there's no way to do that upon first plays. I see that many people rate the game as "heavy" and I don't blame them: I would have too, until after I totally rewrote and reorganized the rule book. After that undertaking, I rate the rules as 'medium-heavy', which in my book means 'a bit daunting to take on and learn but with an extra effort I can probably learn the game, assuming a significant time commitment.' In any case, it's a major undertaking to try to learn and play this game; people will have to decide whether it's worth the effort. Personally, I reckon it is, based on overall ratings and my own limited experience in playing it (as of January 2017).

In my first attempt to learn the game the rulebook stopped me as surely as Hannibal backed by elephants. I purchased this new in May of 2009, and by early March 2010 I'd completed a total rewrite and reorganization of the rule book. I then fine-tuned my 'rules in plain English' version with additional plays. 

Rulebook aside, the production by Valley Games is absolutely gorgeous, and the game looks fantastic when set up. It's also an intriguing design. The use of cards to resolve combat may not be to everyone's taste, but I don't have a problem with it. I expect I could spend years and years trying to exhaust the strategic and tactical possibilities, and given the complexity of the game, that's probably exactly how it will 'play out' for me.

Comment after one session:

Very tense and exciting play: The winner was decided during the last turn, which is always a good thing. Three turns before, the winner was in complete disarray and thought he couldn't win!

I particularly enjoyed the smoothness of play. The Battle system also gives a nice flavor of the period, while being more subtle and less luck dependent than a single dice roll.

An impressive GAME on the Second Punic War: Highly recommended for Ancient and CDG players!

A very good game if the game length and rules complexity isn't an issue. Interesting control mechanics, the chrome manages a good fit to theme, and the card game within a game battle theatrics can be fun, if perhaps overly luck bound. I'd play more if I had more time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very impressed with this - balancing political control against military action seems to be the key. Hannibal as a general is really hard to beat in the first few turns of the game, but he has to strike early and hard, as the odds are stacked against Carthage the longer the game goes on. Battles can be crippling if you lose and have to retreat(very true to life), and we seem to be using the cards more for ops than events, but this may just be inexperience or the way they came out in the draw. The Valley games version is beautifully done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I enjoyed maneuvering armies and I also enjoyed the struggle for political influence but the card-driven battle mechanism really killed this game for me.  There is simply no thought or strategy involved in battles... you just play a card and hope your opponent can't match it.  Battles were about as strategic as playing Uno.  It's a shame... much of the game is well-designed but the battles are so severely lacking that I don't think I'll want to play this again.

Valley Games version

Both plays have ended with Hannibal easily and consistently trouncing every Roman army sent against him resulting in successful sieges of Rome both times (ending before Scipio Africanus even arrived).

The strategy cards and battle card system seem to work much better in this game than other CDGs I've played allowing many different 'paths' to open to players.

Not sure if it's common in plays or not, but neither match saw any important activity outside of Italy (pretty much no other Carthaginian generals moved other than Hannibal) which made this game a bit short sighted to me (why play other generals when Hannibal is the center of gravity and will almost always have significant advantages over most Roman generals).

This is a greaT game! 

In Hannibal there are 2 planes of struggle: one political and one military. You influence regions and you fight your opponent's armies.  One of the clever things about this game is the way both subgames are integrated and influence each other. When you loose a battle, there are repercussions on the political plane and that's great!

I really enjoy the CDG mechanic. You get a lot of historical flavour without too much added complexity, it allows for clever tactical play and is always a source of difficult decisions.

Playtime is around 3/4 hours for us but I suspect it can decrease with experience. That's not too much, for a game like this.

Haven't really played a full game yet, but it looks really really promising. I really like Washington's War and this seems similar enough that it's a pretty sure bet.

Good game. Might not need. Consider trading.

A pretty good card driven wargame. The battle (mini-game) system here is fantastic and works really well. And an interesting topic for a game. It's a pretty good simulation of the conflict, which is a bit of a double edged sword as it makes the game a bit scripted and samey with repeated plays.

I've only played this once so far, but want to return to it.  Good concept with some interesting innovations - determining the outcome of battles by playing manoeuvre/tactics cards is a lovely idea, but at the same time introduces quite an element of luck.  (I'm tempted to say the element of luck seems too large, but on the outcome of one game it's too early to tell, to be honest.)  The board and artwork looks great at first glance but on playing a few shortcomings become apparent; the borders between regions need to be clearer and the values on the cards could be more apparent.

Having played it a couple of more times now, I'm still of the opinion that the battle card mechanic is the shortcoming of the game.  I like all the other elements of it except that.

Despite only 2 partial plays (4 hours to play 4 game years in one game), I feel I can make some valid comments: firstly, this is one game that you need committed players to spend the time and effort. Sadly, I'm time poor, and the rules and mechanics are unweildy mentally and physically with only time giving you some mastery. Still I find this design provides a stronger political and dramatic narrative than other similar designs: 1960 the Making of the President's political system is incremental via cubes, whereas in Hannibal political control is done by tile flipping. Also the card effects translate better in Hannibal, than either 1960 and Twilight Struggle (there was no real feel of espionage in TS, whereas this conveyed far better in Cold War: KGB vs CIA). Also because of the small card manifest which is listed means there is more chance of anticipating events, which is difficult in 1960 and TS. The other plus in Hannibal is the interesting spatial considerations and exciting interaction of the battles, but again it is still a fiddly process. I really enjoy this series of games using the historical "what if" event deck as the central mechanic as I feel I am learning, and look forward to its huge potential being mined for more streamlined designs playable in an evening.

10 games - By Jove! What a game! Strategic, fun, epic. It's everything I like.

In my opinion, the only issue is the victory for Carthage in case of a tie. Carthage has 8 provinces and can take Syracuse automatically with a card. Too easy. So Carthage takes Syracuse and wins the second punic war? What a joke!

Carthage : 6 / Rome : 4

RATING: 9
4 plays. Best light war game.  Gorgeous board and fun Carthaginian die.  Great balance between the 2 sides considering how different their strengths are.    Lots of analyzing after the game is over, which is a great sign.  Approx 4 hours for complete game if you know the rules.

RATING: 8
Update: Definitely a game I wish I had more opportunities to play. Simply a great game. 
 
-------------------
Nice components, except for the cards, which seem a little on the flimsy side. Rule book is clear, and the reference sheet is fairly well laid out. My only previous wargame experience is Memoir '44 and Twilight Struggle. Compared to TS, there is a LOT more to remember. My first game was with another gamer and it took us 3 hours to make it to the 4th round. We had to go back to the rules numerous times, even though we'd both read the rules, and had the reference sheet. The combat system was actually quite fun. 
Would be a '9' if it wasn't so long. After 6 plays (weekday evenings) , we have yet to finish a game.

RATING: 4
Unopened Valley Games edition.

Update:  Finally opened the game game and gave it a shot.  Made it through two hours of rule parsing, and ten minutes worth of turns before we gave up.  The score I've given isn't a reflection of the quality of the game (I get it...it's like a Euro for grogs, kind of)...just on my total lack of any interest whatsoever in playing historical war games.

Possibly the best two player game ever to exist. I finally taught my 13 year old son how to play and he enjoyed it so much he's now reading a book on Hannibal. So many options for strategy. It simulates the battles and politics so well, very balanced. We love this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First short playthrough made it seem that Carthage is definitely disadvantaged by the sea movement conditions. Maybe I expect too much from Hannibal? Worth another play. Second play, Hannibal raced into Italy and was crushed. Third play, Rome got tired of waiting and crossed the Alps and got crushed.

I'll admit it, I play this game terribly. I want to give it another shot after examining the game a bit more, looking at the card potentials and studying the board. Maybe, if I can play this (successfully) as more of a wargame than just a political game, my ratings will rise.

RATING: 8
Still one of the best CDGs, tied with Wilderness War in my esteem.  WW has better themey bits, but Hannibal is definitely the cleaner design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Enjoy the game. Best of the CDG format. Cards work nicely to control movement, incorporate special events. The cards in Hannibal recycle nicely.

The game is ultimately about securing territory so you can limit your opponents movement, response and to cause additional casualties when retreating. 
Like how the battle results impact what you hold - so losing battles cost you position, this mechanic is nicely done. 
While Hannibal is powerful he doesn't dominate, I generally find the Carthaginian player has the more difficult time.

I enjoy the battle cards, it give a nice tactical flavor sort of a mini game for each battle. Very much like you you can control your losses by the battle card play

RATING: 9.3
Boy is that game great or what? This game has it all. Strategy like chance play a certain role depending on your situation and the side you play. The two sides will require different strategy and you will have to manage the luck factor that comes with the strategy and battle cards. The rules are heavy to learn and understand. You will need a couple of play to fully master all the details of the rules. The rule book lacks dramatically of graphic examples. But in the end every thing falls into place after a couple of plays. The theme is realy present and makes the game that much fun. The material is superb. Can't wait to have my plastic generals from VG.
Update: Tried a game with the generals, WOW! And the game was super.

Quel jeu! La stratégie et la chance se cotoient d'une certaine façon selon les situations et le camp que vous jouez. Les deux camps requièrent des stratégies différentes et vous devrez composer avec le facteur chance lors de la pige des cartes de stratégie et de bataille. Les règles sont très complexes et difficiles à comprendre et maîtriser Vous aurez besoin de quelques parties afin de vous familiariser avec les règles. Le livre de règles manque dramatiquement d'exemples illustrés. Mais tout entre dans l'ordre après quelques parties. Le thème est très bien rendu ce qui rend le jeu encore plus captivant. Le matériel est superbe. J'ai bien hâte de recevoir mes généraux de VG.
Mise à jour. J'ai joué une partie avec les généraux, WOW! Et la partie a été super.

Very open game with numerous strategic considerations. It is probably the best balanced game in the CDG range. Very hard thing to do. My gripe are those battle cards. Sure, they work and they're fun, but they drag the game out with the huge hand sizes. Also makes for a rather slow game on ACTS, my primary source of wargaming. Still, very happy to pick up the new VG print run, as it is a good and fairly quick game ftf.

The best strategy game ever, picturing the second punic war. I've always been found of Card Driven Games, it is a simple and elegant style I just like. 

After a certain time playing you know all the cards and can then try to doubble guess what your opponent might have in it's hand.

There are many Card Driven Games these days and some of them are really good if not excellent. However I don't think any CD game has outmatched this one.

Not sure I'm a big fan of CDG's like this yet.  I will have to try a few more times to confirm.

Things I don't like:
1) Many single D6 dice rolls to determine events game changing events.
2) Cards - strategy is based on the cards and if you don't know the deck well then it is impossible to play well.
3) Events - I like that the events add theme and narrative to the game, but too often they come up when you cannot capitalize on them or they come up in your opponents hand.

A very well balanced strategy game for 2 players depicting the big showdown between the Romans and Carthaginians in the 3rd century BC. The strategy cards offer a neverending set of historic surprises, that will keep you and your opponent on your toes until the finale.

I like the gameplay overall, but the card based battle resolution is not my favorite.  My main long-term concern with the game is that it seems if one player (or at least Carthage) gets behind, there's little they can do to get back into the game later: it ends up being a long, drawn-out, painful death with little chance for a better outcome.

Definitely more tactical battles obscured by a game that has little in the overall strategy.  Hannibal must go over the Alps, if you get cards to make it work, he can win.  If you don't get a  favorable hand, you'll probably lose.

I'd played AH's [gameid=68] once or twice back in Austin in the 90's.

2008-12-06 I finally played the earlier game in this series, Hannibal, with a friend in Wrocław.  Yay!  Real wargaming again!  The first time went slowly, as we kept having to check stuff, roughly 20-30 minutes per turn.  I think of myself as most interested in WW2 for wargame purposes, but I enjoyed the subject of this one too, maybe because of my interest in Latin. :)  I was Rome and won by capturing Carthage.  We've since been playing a couple times a month and enjoying it a lot!

2009-04-01: After playing 10 games and still finding it to be a great game, I'm upgrading my rating to 9. This game has acquired special meaning for me. Normally I don't rate long games so highly, because practically speaking I [i]can't [/i] play them frequently. It's too long to [i]literally[/i] want to play all the time, but when I [i]do[/i] have the opportunity to play a long game, Hannibal is always one I'd like to play.

--Nov2012-- More than 5 years after it arrived in my house, I've finally got it to the table.  Was it the crumbling generals moldering in the corner of my Game Room that turned me off?  The ridiculous Carthaginian die?  No; none of that:  just a difficulty in finding a willing opponent.
In the end, the game is tractable; sensible; coherent.  The decisions are cool, and the "Events" just volatile enough that one could blame a close loss on the card draw (even if that's not quite the truth.)  It's an excellent design.

Tremendous CDG game with great flexibility, strategic options, excellent event cards and a brilliant battle procedure that adds to the game some tactical elements. The board is the most beautiful I have ever seen, the quality at top level. 

Problems: The structure of the rule book is bad. In addition, there are many rules (which are easy to understand ) and the playing time can go up to 4 hours. Finally, as a real complex CDG, you need at least 2 plays before you really start understanding what is going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow, I have yet to find a single flaw to this amazing game. The theme is spot on, the battles are tense (even with the polemical battle cards), the strategic decisions continually renew themselves. Having a grand strategy and adapting it to your hands of cards every turn makes for very intense gaming. The game is long, but who cares when you're having fun?

Add: There IS after a number of plays a certain lack of variability in the strategies and moves available.

For me, this lives up to the hype. It's everything I love about Wilderness War, with a tighter playing time, an excellent area control system, and better components. And I even like the combat cards, so there. The single CDG deck really works well here, because the events cycle quickly and there are a lot of ways to spend your OPs.

Though they are a comedy of errors in every other respect, VG did a very good job on the components here.

RATING: 10
Your first outing here is probably going to be a slow affair as you reference rules and deal with each situation for the first time. All following games are a blast! More so if you read up on and can appreciate the history behind the game. The designer has done a fantastic job of bringing the history of the Second Punic war to a board game and yet creating a balanced and fun experience. 

While I can't help feeling that everything about the game is trying hard to push me down a set path, I've learned to appreciate that. After all, I'm playing the Second Punic War and so there's reasons behind why each side did what they did. Those reasons are cleverly woven into the game through modifiers, abilities of different generals, attrition and sea movement, etc.  I've come to appreciate a steered path over pure randomness.

I've also learned to really appreciate the cleverness of the battle cards. Initially I thought they were a pain - like they are in We the People - but they've been refined here into an often tense battle simulation. Generals can play the odds, give up initiative for the extra glory of the Double Envelopment, bluff with a reserve card, try and drag out the battle for extra battle losses, etc. There's some nail biting moments for sure.

This is a game I'm looking forward to playing time and time again. The theme is one I'm interested in and one the game has made me more interested in. Rules are a bit fiddly if you haven't played in a while, so I'll be sure of getting this to the table at least every six months - it deserves it.

The Valley Games board is very hard to read in Italy - brown borders on brown background. Otherwise (despite the -1 minor Alps typo), it's nice.

A classic CDG that is always fun to play.  I like that both sides are fairly evenly matched and that the road to victory can be achieved in many different ways.  They pretty much all include taking provinces, it is just nice that you never really know which provinces will matter by game end.

Glad to have Valley Games' printing.  Luscious components.  Impressive.

Game itself lives up to the hype and reputation.  Lots of fun and replayability as typical CDGs.  Can be as deep as you want it to be.  Combat seems a bit clunky.  Could there be a variant using the Washington's War mechanic?

Uses the [b]We the People system[/b], including battle cards. The Carthaginians operate on a knife-edge and can't afford to lose a single major battle or too many units, since most of their reinforcements begin in Hispania or Africa, far away from Italy. However, the Carthaginians do get the most powerful general in the game, Hannibal, with a large army at the very start. Because of the inability to easily replace losses, they tend to avoid battle and spend most of their time pillaging Italy.

The Romans have weak leaders at first, but can raise endless legions of troops. In late game, the general Scipio Africanus arrives with a large army. He is the only Roman general to be the equal of Hannibal. The strategy card "Spy in Enemy Camp", allows you to examine half of your opponent's battle cards, which is ridiculously overpowered.

Simonitch takes the superb and innovative We the People CDG system and cranks it up one level. With the setting as the second punic war, it's already half the battle won. The cards are now utterly more useful and can be used as an event or ops card (activate generals, place PC markers, convert PC markers).The gameplay is very tense and there are so many agonising decisions to be made. Each side has a different set of strategies and with the cards, each game can be vastly different. This system is elegant and I believe will stand up to repeated playings.Own unpunched AH version from the last days (sticky taped shut instead of shrinkwrapped). Still has Hobbytown USA sticker on it for $40.

Update: Sold original copy. Preordered VG version.

Almost bloody perfect.
Rules are complex, yet intuitive & logical once you realize what they are supposed to represent irl. The cards mechanics are seamless, and make a very rich gaming experience. Played like 30 games of it, not 2 similar, despite having developped a Romand Doctrine I now more or less stick to.
Only gripe with the game, is that sometimes a single die result can have an hugely important on the whoe rest of the game.
But, hell, "Alea Jacta Est", eh?

RATING: 8
Hannibal is an awesome system. It has aged surprisingly well. Learning the rules took a few games, but Hannibal just seems the capture the right balance of game and simulation. Abstracting history is a tremendous challenge, and I marvel at how well this game has succeeded. There is just enough asymmetry to make playing both sides exciting and different, and not so much that the conflict is unbalanced. Each game is filled with tension...can you tell I haven't played this for awhile? I enjoy the game, but it does require a good 3 hours to play, and it's often a challenge to find that much time for a 2 player game. Also, Hannibal's rules are *just* complex enough that I know I will have to relearn 50% of the rules next time I bust this out. So, those are my two gripes about the game. Even so, this one is a keeper for me, and I look forward to future plays. Valley Games also did a very fun publishing job, insofar as the materials are concerned. The board comes together like a giant jigsaw, the cards and counters are all high quality, and eventually, even my miniature generals arrived!

Gran juego histórico sobre la II Guerra Púnica. Motor de cartas y precioso mapa de movimientos punto a punto. Componentes de buena calidad y gran estética. 
Todos los eventos contemplados sucedieron realmente, dándole una gran ambientación histórica. Dificultad media para ser un wargueim, 9 turnos los cuales precisan una 1/2 hora para completarse. 
El sistema de combate es original: Se resuelve con Cartas de Batalla, aprox. un 25%-75% de estrategia - suerte respectivamente; es uno de los aciertos del juego, aunque alarga el tiempo de ejecución.

Régóta rajta volt a kipróbálási listámon, nagy reményekkel vágtam neki a TS elődnek. Abszolút nem csalódtam! Az egyik játékos Római Birodalmat, a másik a karthágóiakat irányítja. A cél Róma, illetve Karthágó elfoglalása, illetve ha ez nem sikerült 9 forduló alatt, akkor a játék végén, aki több tartományt birtokol azé a győzelem, a döntetlen Karthágónak kedvez, ami jelen esetben nagyon sokat számít, ugyanis a játék jó játék esetén végig kiegyenlített marad. Első játékunkban egyszer sem vezetett egyik fél sem 3-al. A két félnek teljesen más a stratégiája. Lehet a történelmet követni és Hannibállal átkelni az Alpokon, de teljesen felül is lehet írni a múltat. A karthágóiak főleg hadvezérekben erősek, a rómaiak utánpótlásban és lapok terén. Nagyon jól megoldott a csata, talán az egyik legjobb, amivel találkoztam. 6 különböző lap, ebből egy dzsóker, amit csak a harcra használunk. Annyi az egész, hogy amíg a védekező fél tud ugyanolyan kártyát kirakni, mint a másik, addig tartja magát, aki először nem tud rakni vagy nem ugyanolyat az veszít. Természetesen a kezdő lapszám függ a találkozó seregek és hadvezérek mennyiségétől és szintjeitől. Egyszerű, mégis tökéletesen működik. Szép és jó a térkép felosztása, elég jó kiegyenlített a két fél, bár Rómát kicsit erősebbnek érzem. Egy dologba tudok csak belekötni, de ezt is lehet több játék után másképp látnám, hogy az egyes eseménylapok közt vannak nagyon erősek, ami egy teljes provinciát tudnak elvenni az egyik féltől, ami rengeteget számíthat. Nagyon egyben van ez a játék, abszolút megérdemli a top100-ban a helyét. Persze hosszú és a szabálya sem annyira letisztult, mint a TS-é, de nagyon jó játék.

Good: As a wargame this game excels. It brings home a real wargame feel in less time than most wargames do. The strategy deck is simply awesome.

Bad: The combat system is novel and quick and strategic, but perhaps more strategy aimed at counting cards and poker than any war tactics.

Bottom Line: I'm a reformed wargamer. I love wargames but don't have time and can't find players normally. I've played this 12 times in the past year. It's a wargame you can count on getting finished.

Great setting and asymmetric struggle between Carthage and Rome. Hannibal is both Carthage's strongest asset but also its greatest liability. There is tension building up as Hannibal crosses the Alps and must play a carefully choreographed dance with superior Roman forces while attempting to make political inroads. Requires careful strategic play.

Main negative: rules can be a bit overwhelming with bits that can be easily forgotten (in conjunction with no player aids), some typographical errors on the map.

Great theme, nice movement system, great use of contol markers (for losing battles , weathering and popular opinion). Superior to We the People in that cards are much more balanced and you aren't stuck with a hand you can't use (although I kind of miss the othello like quality that the control markers had in We the People).  While I do think this is an excellent game I don't think that this is worth the price that it is going for on ebay (and here on the geek), this is at most a $70 game (and that is stretching it.  Still, it evokes the theme and mood quite well while remaining abstract enough not to get bogged down in the Berg-like details.  My only complaint that perhaps it is a bit too long for what it is (but, I'm not a huge fan of two player war games). Deserves a reprint.

What sets this apart from regular wargames is the political control system; the cleverest maneuvering of armies accomplishes little and can be downright dangerous if you don't pay equal attention to winning over the locals. There's a lot else to like about this game, but I find it hard work to play, requiring frequent searches through the rule book for the first couple of games at least, and always a lot of die rolls and table-consulting. It doesn't help that sometimes negative factors are bad, and sometimes they're good, so that you forget whether you're trying to roll high or low. Call me crazy, but I sold my copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
As far as I'm concerned, this is the gold standard of an elegant CDG.  I was a little unsure of the battle cards concept at first, but now whole-heartedly support them for this game.  

Anyone with a nodding understanding of the second punic war would realize that it pitted Hannibal's tactical genius against the overwhelming strategic advantages of the Romans.

By necessity, tactical games on the war would have to tilt "pro-Carthage", while strategic level games would inevitably tilt "pro-Roman".  Trying to do both leads to a freakin' monster - probably unplayable.

The battle cards do a very nice job of abstracting the tactical combat while allowing the tactical genii - Hannibal and Scipio - to overcome long odds against lesser lights.

RATING: 9.5
A great two-player wargame. I think it's got all the elements that you want in one. The use of the political control markers shift back and forth much like Twilight Struggle (yet the wargame aspect of it makes this game much more interesting). It encourages spreading out of troops in order to gain that control. Combat is awesome - the longer it goes, the more both sides lose, but the loser ends up always taking some significant losses. I love how there are tactics cards in battles, and a lucky draw can get you a win there, but often probabilities hold the day. It just might be the best two-player wargame out there.

RATING: 7.5
Only one play, and a few read throughs of the rules.  I feel I can pretty adequately assess this game as it compares to Twilight Struggle, Successors, and 1960...  it's very good, between TS and 1960 in terms of my enjoyment (TS being one of my very favourite games, period, 1960 being one I just like - -RvC is closer to TS than 1960).  It's probably closest to Successors, which I also quite like -- it's very close to being the 2-player game on which Successors is built, I guess.

It is not as tense as TS, and the card decisions are rarely as immediately agonizing, two factors that push TS over the top into "legendary" status for me.  Still, the battle resolution mechanic of RvC is sweet, and the game itself is beautiful.  My only quibble is that sea-movement seems soooooo integral to me, yet you can be hosed in a huge way by a single roll -- that's very swingy, and while historically accurate might not make for the best games in some situations.  I think those would be rare, however.

Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, after 1 play, rating: 7
Well, I have seen the mechanics before (Paths of Glory, Twilight Struggle, 1960: The Making of the President and so on) and I like them, especially the battlecard part is really good (if the battles are large). I am also a big fan of Rome and that part of the history. I have even read a large Hannibal book a year ago. AND (not but) I like this game. It was a tense experience, and I won so what could I complain about? 
I do not like the victory condition. Why not? Because you are in a disadvantage if you have to attack, but you win the game if you control more then half of the map. So you take a little more then half the map and then let your opponent attack your stronger position. I would like a victory condition that forced you to be more offensive, both as Romans and as Hannibal.
Oh I don’t really know... Might have to play the game some more times.

I rated it a 7 just because I don't want to be unfair to the game.

I find it to be boring. You do the same thing over and over. It's just a matter of taste. There's nothing in the game that I like.

I admit that maybe I wasn't in the right mood and with the needed security on the rules to enjoy the experience.I may have to try it again in order to decide better what to think about his one. The thing is that I'm not in a hurry to try it again and that may be an issue.

For me, the high point of this game is its simple but very tense battle system of dueling card play, always exciting. The rest of it is fun too, with the political markers adding another demanding dimension to your strategy. The finer points of movement, retreats, interceptions, etc. bog it down somewhat to me.

Solid game.  I have not played a lot of CDG but I can tell this one is special.  Seems fairly balanced, although I feel the cards favor Carthage.  But that may just have been my one play and looking at it through (what is the opposite of rose) colored glasses. 

The game is tight; but there can be wild swings in fate.  Many of the events are extremely situational, but if the situation exists, they can be hugely powerful.  So these events are really hit or miss.  Then there is the fate of the dice, where there are situations where you roll for losses (attrition, retreat, crossing the alps) and the one die roll will result in you losing from 0%-50% of your army.  A bad roll here can cripple your ability to wage war.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pretty good strategic war game with a lot of area control. Game play is pretty smooth, we were up and running fairly quickly and it all made sense. 

The board is disappointing; type is distorted and doesn't always stand out well, straights can be hard to see, and the unpolished, amateur pencil drawings only add distraction. With such accomplished illustration and design on the box cover, how could they think that this scribbley crap was acceptable?

My experience so far: Overwhelmed, sometimes lost not knowing what to do, the format of the instructions booklet provokes innecesary downtime.

Should I play it again? Maybe, 1 per month as much.

RATING: 6.75
Very tedius. The game is very beautiful (to look at), but it is not very practical in its component design which isn't optimized for actual gameplay. I like that things are good-looking, but I also like that it is easy to decipher. For instance it should be possible to obtain relevant information by just LOOKING at the gameboard (like an armys size). This game has some problems in this regard. The rulebook could also be better, and the gameboard actually has an embarrasingly printing error on it. Be sure too check a FAQ or errata before you play.

The game in itself is a quite good 2-player, and recommendable. There is definitely a big luck-factor, and sometimes single-standing disasters can ruin the game for either site (For example Hannibal losing his first battle with double envelope and being wiped of the board). Despite this it actually remains a quite good game. War is chancy business! 

The game seems well-balanced between Rome and Carthage.

Great theme play.  Fairly easy to learn, very accessible CDW.  Take some plays to learn strategy.  The combat system uses a diceless battle card system which is unique to CDWs.

The rulebook is well written and very well organized.

I can see what people mean when they say you can "formulate a plan for the turn" when looking over your hand.  It's far more true in this game than in a lot of CDGs, where things like supply issues can really force your hand (and force you to change your plans for your hand).  Partly it's because your replacements are preprogrammed, whereas in games like PoG you're always trying to create a window for yourself to take replacements.

Worries?  Well, it's a pretty straightforward situation--I don't know how much strategic flexibility either side has.  That means that the game may have a certain sameness over time.  Worse than, say, War of the Ring?  I don't know.  Hopefully time will tell!

An excellent light war game.  I'd rate it higher if not for the length.  4+ hours is a bit too much for me.  Most games that long wouldn't interest me at all but I like the subject matter, I like the presentation (new Valley Games version) and it's a very fun game.

RATING: 9
One of the few games I have played 50 times. One of the 10 ratings suggested it was flawless. No game is worth 10 and the game makes Hannibal too vunerable in combat - great system though. The original Herman system went down the pan when the battle cards were removed in later games.

Finally got it on the table, and it did not disappoint.  I am usually a pretty fast player, but, for whatever reason, I'm a turtle in CDGs.  So, my first game took 4 hours.

Card-driven wargame in the mould of 'We the People'. 'Hannibal' takes the main features of the aforementioned game and develops upon them thereby becoming a truly great game in its own right. Cards can now be played for their operations points or to trigger certain events, and the placing of political control markers has become increasingly strategic and less of a tit for tat affair. The introduction of combat cards, where opponents receive a number of cards dependent on their combat strength and these are played until one side is unable to match the cards played by the other, makes battles far more tense occurrences. Overall, this is an extremely deep and strategically rewarding game.

There really isn't much to say about this game that hasn't already been said by the others who have also assigned this game a high score. This is the card-driven gaming system at its peak; a tense game with just the right blend of chance and planning, and constantly difficult decisions. The battle card system may slow down the game a bit, but provides the game with a capacity for upsets that one could not get using a standard CRT - and is therefore well worth it. The best 2-player game in my collection; if not the best 2-player wargame.

RATING: 7.5
Good card driven wargame that is as much tactical as strategic. Overall game strategy is clear for both sides (carthage: rush to North Italy, secure and split off your seafaring general to keep forces occupied and free him for your carthage stack after the reshuffle, use your superior mobility to put hannibal in south eastern Italy taking multiple provinces when the time (i.e. your hand) is right. Rome: keep hannibal and aupport in liguria and prepare for the push towards spain), but it is the tactics that both drive your hand as well as the timing aspects of the overall strategy. Is travel out of Africa still permitted? Does my opponent have a storm when I need to make a crossover? Is hannibal still well enough supplied or should I take my foot off the pedal? Can I already start putting pressure to Spain? Is sicily about to be invaded?

You'll find the same set of moves being performed across multiple games, though not all and at different timing. And it is these last elements, coupled with a pretty cool battle mechanism which even adds in a bluff element, that keeps the game involved at every turn.

Add good theme and you have a great game. Why only 7.5 then? After some games I do start to wonder about the replay value. Certainly not something I expected from a game that is touted as the "best strategy game". More experience will tell.

Great game? Yes. Worth owning? Yes. Go out on a limb to on it? Not necessary.

Incredible game. Replayability is really good on this one. Before knowing exactly what to do with the Romans you will want to try the Carthagenians who will change your perspective of the game (and vice versa). Knowing the cards is of course the real pleasure of "Hannibal". So a fairly good level of time investment is needed to have some fun. The originality of the battle system really please me (cards instead of dice) even if there is generaly no real decision to make. Beware of the damned "Sicilian revolt"...

It's a little hard figuring out the rules if you're not taught and have never played before.  But once you muddle through it, there's a gem in here.  After only one play, I find myself drawn and wanting to play it more.  I just can't find the time.

Hannibal is my favorite war game.  I liked it from the first play, although there's a lot to the game, and you have to assume that rules will be missed early on.  I'm impressed with how the design of Hannibal captures the essence of the Second Punic War.  The strategic depth is deep, but there are still several tactical decisions to be made.

Mark Simonitch had hit the bulleyes!  The political game and battle resolution using cards are inherited from "We the People", but when Simonitch tied the Operation and Event elements into one Strategy card, than the card-driven mechanics is finally mature.
Now each card represent some resource from your empire, you can activate your general (supply troop), hire mercenaries, do some intrigues (spying, bribing enemy allies), diplomacies (naval reinforcement from other country), or even pray for gods (weather, luck, etc).  Your hand management now represents resource management, and playing which card in which order may affect your initiative.  As a result, every card played is a hard decision that require planning, bluff and of course some luck. 
This game also excel that it has only 3 to 4 stacks of armies per side and can be completed under 4 hours, how many wargame can claim to have that many strong points?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After a couple of plays, the only thing I can compare it to is Twilight Struggle and its card driven tense-ness. Combat is random, but weighted and usually won by the better prepared army. It feels fun, but the event cards can really swing the game and in a long tight game, a player can lose in the last turn through no fault of their own if the other guy gets really good cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've now received my copy from Valley Games, and this is a provisional rating after a couple of plays (on wargameroom.com), both of which I greatly enjoyed.  Hannibal is a wonderful mix of maneuver and combat, with politics and area control: concentrating only on winning every battle, or neglecting clever positioning of your forces, will clearly lose you the game.  While the rules are not as clear and concise as they might be, Hannibal is a lighter wargame that plays relatively quickly (1.5-2 hours for my first plays online, so I could easily see games between experienced players taking two hours 'face to face', and 60-75 minutes online).  Like many card-driven wargames, there seems to be quite a bit of luck involved.  Battles especially - in my opinion, this is particularly appropriate in a game of ancient warfare - are not known quantities, and while it pays to play the odds, there's plenty of room for inferior forces, played smartly with fortunate draws, to win the day.

The Valley Games reprint of this game is without a doubt the most visually attractive, and highest production value, wargame, and for that matter, perhaps even boardgame, that I own.  (My only minor complaint with the map is that the lines of the two straits can be difficult to see in certain qualities of light.)

Rating may get higher after more plays, but at the moment this seems just a bit too confused to be fun. It seems that the makings of a light wargame have been stretched & expanded to create an unnecessarily heavy end result. (for example, some of the event cards are way too powerful).

RATING: 8
Excellent game. It keeps everything simple but exciting. A very good game to teach beginning wargames as well. You really understand the difficulties the Carthaginians, i.e. Hannibal, had with supply. The Romans can't just simply overwhelm Hannibal and need to slowly whittle his army away.

RATING: 6
First time I've ever played a war game; we made it through only 7 of the 9 turns in 4 hours. Extremely involved game and very difficult to gain a foothold in a new region. Need to figure out a better strategy if I'm ever to play this game again.

Hannibal taught me I'm truly a Eurogamer.  It's layer after layer of fiddly rules that must be digested for hours and hours, and for what?  Hannibal must follow the same basic strategy every game, and battles are resolved with less sophistication than War.  How about Hannibal: The Card Game?

I prefer [i]War of the Ring[/i] and [i]Twilight Struggle[/i] as far as 2-player CDGs go, but this one also has a permanent place on my shelf due to the fun, unique battle system (that more games should borrow from) and a high incentive for conflict.

As far as the Valley Games edition goes, I think the rules are a hot mess -- definitely more convoluted than they need to be -- though the cheat sheet is pretty good.  The rules are also full of careless typos.  The quality of the components are extremely good, but I'm not a fan of the early-to-mid-2000s CGI which already looked extremely dated the day the game went to print.  And the map is overly busy with indistinct borders.  Overall, a disappointing production even though you tell the publisher tried really, really hard to make it look amazing.

Fun game that I'd like to become more familiar with.  There's definitely a learning curve, though that's true of pretty much any game of this complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I tempted to give this an 8, but I think that's due to the influence of its reputation. I've played two and a half times, and I've found the game a bit at odds with itself. The movement and card systems are so clean and elegant as to be almost stilted. It then comes as a brutal shock when one bad die roll decimates your main army and your hopes of victory. But my impressions may stem from the fact that I have only played as Carthage. Playing Rome might be more forgiving.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great gameplay full of tension and suspence.

Historically good but some critics :
- the sieges are not interesting enough and are not pursued in the game (in the Second Punic War, 7 of the 12 cities have been stormed)
- The Double Envelopment is used a lot in the real war (Trebia, Trasimene, Cannae, but also Ilipae by Scipio and other battles less known) but in the game, the automatic loss of initiative makes it too dangerous to be really interesting, even for Hannibal.
- Overseas ventures should be more tempting for the Romans as in the real war

It can probably be improved by the variants of Charles Féaux de la Croix (Variant 1 : alternate siege rules, alternate setup, but New Carthago and Gades would not enjoy special status as they fell rather easily in the actual war). I'd also like to give to the best generals an advantage to play Double Envelopment which I think is too dangerous to be worth the risk actually and has the same effect as Hannibal faces Varro or Scipio Africanus. An example could be that the initiative is to be rolled but the defender can double his tactical rating in case of a Double Envelopment played, which makes its use easier when faced with a bad general like Varro and seems historical : every Double envelopment who succeeded in the war was against a lousy general (variant 2)
Addendum 15/05/10 : la variant 2 est trop avantageuse pour Carthage. Variante 3 : idem variante 1 mais les engins de siège carthaginois commencent à Carthago Nova (si contrôlé et non assiégé) plutôt qu'avec un général carthaginois. Ils peuvent passer la mer mais pas les cols. Compte comme 1 unité pour le mouvement naval.

Variante 1 : favorise un peu Carthage (à privilégier)
Variante 2 : favorise beaucoup Carthage
Variante 3 : équilibrée

Thanks to Valley Games and their mighty reprint I finally got to play this game of old.  Having never played the AH edition of the game but studied the pictures here on the geek I can say that visually it appears that Valley stayed very true to form.  Map board is as beautiful as ever and the battle cards themselves look pretty much identical.  The game play is amazing.  Card driven perfection.  Again with only 1 game down it's hard to delineate what a sound strategy is for each side but it was fun going back and forth.  I look forward to giving this another try soon.

This game lives up to its reputation as a wargaming classic. There's much talk about how Hannibal is a shining star of the Card-Driven genre, a genre that I generally don't care for. But what makes this game great isn't the cards - it's the balance and decision-making of the gameplay. You don't come away from the game thinking in terms of cardplay like you do in Twilight Struggle (which is still a fine game). The cards keep the game moving forward by reducing Analysis Paralysis and adding historical flavor through events, but what you remember about a session are your strategic choices. The ability of this game to pack so much strategy into a 2-3 hour package is what's most impressive, and what will keep this game coming back to the table.

One of the best card-driven strategy games I've played. Has great feel of history in the making and nice play balance.

There's a slip of paper in the box with the score 5 to 5, I'm playing Carthage.  We just don't seem to play anything repeatedly for a long period of time.  We're always relearning this one.

This is a fun war game for 2 players.  One person takes Rome with Italy and the islands in their control and the other takes Carthage with Africa and Spain in it's control.  The goal is to have more political influence than your opponent.  In addition there are sudden death scenarios.  If Hanibal dies or the Carthage capital is lost then Carthage loses.  If Rome looses it's city then Rome loses.  Play is controlled by situation cards which can either be used to move generals, place influence markers or events.  Battles are fought using battle cards with a simple matching mechanism.  Armies are lost during retreat and attrition after battle or attrition while crossing the mountains.  It's heavy enough to offer lots of choices and light enough that it can be taught quickly.  Overall a great game.

RATING: 8
Very good.  Deserving of its stature as a classic, even if I miss some of the bells and whistles that have come to the card-driven wargame genre since.  Fast-paced, but still engrossing, which is a hard combination to achieve.  The battles are faster than I was worried about, and the continuously-eroding political control system is really fantastic.  I love the asymmetric but balanced sides.  The biggest drawback to this game is that the rules take a long time to explain, much more so than the game itself warrants.  It's important to tell a new player almost all of the rules, because they almost all have a significant impact on strategy - the rules don't leave you much ability to say "There's also some more specifics about X, but we'll cover that when we get to it."  New players need to know the whole from the get-go, or else the game won't make sense.

Not a bad game at all but likely won't play it. I only played a partial game of this (i.e. 1 turn) but it didn't do it for me. Beautiful and gorgeous components. Nice board but this is not the type of game I enjoy though I would much prefer playing this over Descent.

Bought this one recently with the express intent of getting my wife to play a less complex CDW. After a hard-fought, intense game that came right down to the wire she decided she like CDW's.

I can see why this was such a grail when it was OOP- it really is the perfect card-driven war game for Euro gamers, with its relative simplicity and fluid board play. Although I'm not compelled by CDG card management in general (Twilight Struggle leaves me cold), I really enjoy the other aspects of the game like the asymmetrical powers and particularly the battle system which is loads of fun. I do wonder if this overstays its welcome- I've actually never played the full 9 rounds (as so far someone has always resigned) but already by halfway I start to get restless. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is one of those games where I want to rate it a 7 right off the bat, because what's so good about the game works very well, but I still have some slight issues with the game, and besides, we didn't even play a complete game in our first, 4-hour game.  The two sides seem to be balanced well, and the cards seem to allow for an element of strategy, though you're still going to come across a lot of "What the heck am I going to do with THESE cards?" moments.  I'm not familiar enough with the game to know whether the game is initially in Carthage's favor, but the Carthage player certainly has more control over the generals he uses, and can maintain more certainty between rounds, which to me seems to be a slight advantage.

I'm not sure how I feel about the battle deck.  It's a clever enough way to develop a fog-of-war effect, but it can be frustrating to draw 18 cards to your opponent's 7, and then not have one of the two cards that you need to respond to the attack.  Careful planning can account for a lot of it, but no amount of planning will help against a bad draw.  Again, it's the necessary fog-of-war effect, but I'm still getting used to the frustration that comes with it.

I'd play this again.  It's just a shame that it takes so long.

I found trying to understand the rules with its many exceptions to be quite hardwork. However once i started playing all that was forgotten. Great game, feels very open and free in terms of strategy in comparison to Twilight Struggle which now feel very constrained and scripted. I actually enjoyed the sub-game of battle cards which resolves conflict. 

*Update: Easy one of the best games i've ever played. Card play, battles and politics all seemlessly interact with one another.

This was my first exposure to card driven wargaming and I have to say, it is an excellent system. The version I own is the Valley Games edition, which as far as I can tell is functionally identical to the original, right down to the god-awful rulebook. Of course, it's probably a very well done rulebook if you are a hardcore hex and chit grognard. To us dabblers though, this thing is like reading tax code.

Thanks to some help from the player aids on the geek, I've managed to wrap my head around it and I'm very glad I made the effort. It is an excellent game. Beautiful to look at, dripping in theme, (I can count to 6 in Carthaginian!) and fascinating to play. Next stop...Washington's War!

Played it about 5 times until now with a friend of mine. At first overwhelming for a "Euro" guy like me.

Reading and understanding the rules and then actually play it took quite some time. The first games were just a learning experience, making (rules) mistakes, learning to develop a strategy etc. 

The last 2 plays were really exciting! We made little rules mistakes and we played more strategic. Even better, we were able to finish the game!

Playing the right cards on the right moment can be crucial. The battle system is fantastic, far more exciting than dice! We hope to play this game more...

Have both the old AH and newer VG editions.  The only change I see is you can't lose automatically by losing Hannibal in the new version.

after reading the rules and rereading the rules and some more reading of rules, and a bit more reading of rules (hey i'm a german boardgames fanatic, not a war gamer!), I've began to get some semblance on how to play this game. Preliminary rating of 7.5. I think there's certainly a lot to think about. Even 6 years later, some of the game mechanics are quite refreshing to a newbie. I can see why people rate it. Funny how it took this long for a couple of copies to appear in our stores! Initial game length approx 4 hrs so far...only halfway through...although we are learning it! After half a play, I'd rate this a great game. It won't get any higher due to the fact of the length of the game, but some great bit of game in it that's for sure! 290204 Finally managed a win after my 5th game! Playing Carthage, lasted to final year 12 regions to 6, with Hannibal still alive and well!

A very good card-drive game with fairly tight focus, but the incredibly ovepowering role of luck in combat by virtue of the maneuver cards can really leave a sour taste -- you can lose a battle where you have superior numbers by virtue of a bad card draw without ever getting the opportunity to "do" anything... I do not like games where outcomes are predetermined and my decisions are made for me -- but the rest of the game is still fun. Has dropped from a 9.5 to a 7.5 after the last few playings, though -- as the huge swings in luck can be incredibly frustrating.

Excellent 2-player game. Historical flair is great. 

What I love about it is how you plan your objectives for the season depending on the cards you're dealt. There's a very nice balance between "this opportunity is too good to pass up" and "this is a little too risky at this time". While political control is what matters in the long run, you can turn it around with a hearty battle. Send your forces on a campaign and strike a blow, or gather resources and allies. Or do both - but which first? Sometimes the playing order of two cards make a difference. You have to guess your opponent's moves. Brilliant.

The battle mechanics are also wonderful in how close battles can be, and how you can take your chance and win even as the underdog - good risk/reward ratio, and nicely simple at the same time.

Replay value is decent. Depending on which cards you get you can pull off different strategies. Not that there are terribly many different strategies, but it's the execution that counts, and little things can matter.

Once both players are familiar with the game, it actually plays relatively fast and can end quickly if a big battle happens to be decisive.

The best card-driven AH title.  I like the card-driven aspect of both strategy and combat.  I am not the greatest fan of the combat system, but the game play oveshadows the combat system.  The cards as strategy is my favorite part of the game.  With the explosion of card driven games hitting the market, I would say, "Don't buy this game" as you are able to get games that play just as well that are still in print.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The father of other card-driven wargames has a character and a pace of its own. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the design despite (comparatively) old age. The system has its quirks but works very well as a whole. There are plenty of tough decisions to make. There's a constantly high tension level until things start to go Bad for one side. There is a fascinating landslide effect that makes recovery very difficult after some critical but not so obvious loss of balance takes place. Plenty of depth and many things to learn here.

After 1 Play: I'm not much of a wargamer, and this wasn't the game to convert me.  The game is interesting enough to play, but not for the 6+ hours that my first game took.  A large part of the problem is that wargame rules just don't click with me.  I can understand them when I read them, but I don't see the logical framework that makes remembering euro rules very easy.  Instead, I spend half my time during the game in the rulebook instead of focusing on a strategy, which I just don't find enjoyable.

Beautiful map. Card driven war and placement game. Rome has a huge advantage controlling the seas, so it's more difficult to win with Hannibal. Though playing with Hannibal is good fun, he's really very powerful, as should be. Battle system is unique, driven by cards that you have to match. Love that part of the game a lot.

7/19/17 - I've had to come to terms with the fact that I just don't like this game very much.  I recognize that it's good, so I have to chalk this up to my own personal tastes and sense of aesthetics.  History aside, I don't like how the game takes place around the periphery of the board, with just gobs of empty, unplayable sea in the middle.  Also, I feel like there is so little the players can count on--no refuge of any kind from the constant high stakes and tension.  I don't know; it just doesn't work for me.  In spite of its obvious inferiority of design, I much prefer We the People/Washington's War.

4/4/08 - A recent go at Hannibal has knocked it up a pip.  One day my opponent will learn to stop rolling 6's on the Carthaginian naval table, but otherwise an outstanding game.

4/9/07 - I really suck the big one when playing this game.  It's good, if a little long, but I couldn't win to save my life.  If you ever want to feel good about yourself, challenge me to play against you in either this game or chess, and you're guaranteed to win (even if your brain has been surgically removed).  I prefer We The People in terms of fun, but Hannibal is a huge improvement on the system (because battles last long enough to make the shuffling time worthwhile and because the events and OPS are not seperate).

I’ve found this to be a political game first and a combat game second.  I’ve also discovered that if you lose sight of that and transpose those priorities, you’re likely going to lose.

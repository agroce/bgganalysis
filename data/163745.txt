Solid game, got burned out with tournament play style taking over most everywhere I wanted to play. Empire just feels really weak to me (rebel player here). Maybe with future updates I will change my tune but for now it back of the shelf as my gaming buds have largely moved on from this one sadly.

This game is butter in the Star Wars miniatures system, now with capital scale ships and sprawling little fighter squadrons zipping here and there. The system is very similar to X-Wing which I quite liked, but this feels better to me. Movement is cleaner and more refined. Combat is similar, but managing the firing arcs and shields for your large ships is enticing and very fun. Using your squadrons effectively is part of the key to victory. And I haven't even experienced all the subsystems of special abilities and scenarios. But love it.

RATING: 6
I've only played this a couple of times, but my initial feeling is that I like X-Wing/Star Trek Attack Wing better.  Armada feels more plodding and restrictive in its maneuvering, which makes sense for the theme, but also makes it less interesting to me.  I find the guessing game of planning maneuvers in X-/Attack Wing more interesting than the multi-turn planning in Armada, which, for a beginner, feels like a crap shoot.

I'm willing to give Armada some more plays, especially with more ships than come in the core set, but it's not something I'm going to invest any money in at this point.

I've found this game tough to get to the table, but man is it an amazing game experience. Where X-Wing is all about tactical movement, Armada focuses on grand strategic positioning and requires you to think several turns ahead. FFG did an amazing job with this one.

FAVOURITE GAME - This is the big brother of X-Wing. The mechanics is basically the same, it is a tactical combat game, but the emphasis is on big ships, and their accompanying squadrons which gives to this game a more in-depth feeling. Also you have to pre-programme your ship for rounds in advance anticipating the enemy's move, and also it is much harder to evade hits as in it's predecessor. The game is huge, but if you are into awesomeness, then you must buy at least one wave of upgrade, which doesn't come cheap. A negative side to this game are the ships which are less detailed and painted, and the minuscule squadrons are also not the best miniatures from the market.

If you can get past the cost, the need for a large surface to play upon, and a long set up time, this game is fantastic.  Whether you like Star Wars or not, this is just fun to play.  We play without the objectives often and just have it out with big ships.  Once you get going, it's pretty quick with no down time, so I like to play a few games in a row.  I don't play many other mini games, but this one is worth keeping.

The Correlian Campaign has revitalized this game.  It's a great way to play and keeps the game from getting stale.  I've been researching builds and strategies for the campaign a lot--it's captivating.

Rarely does a game so perfectly capture its intent. The maneuvers, the planning, the list-building, the swarms of fighters - it feels like capital ship engagements. The quality of the ships is astounding (which, regretably, makes the unpainted fighters feel very cheap by comparison - the only criticism I can level at the game, and even that has clearly been done for good reason). 

I used to play Starfleet Battles, a notoriously rules-heavy space combat simulator. Armada allows me - with far fewer rules, less time, and less book-keeping, to capture that same experience.

RATING: 6
6/26/15: The fiddliness is becoming more prominent.  Weaving the maneuver tool through all the ships, the tiny cards, the storage of the minis, the crowded table, etc.  Part of the issue is that the guy I play with wants a simpler wargame that would allow larger fleets, and this ain't it.  I think that it's fun, but not something that's going to become a regular favorite.  Our second game took about 2.5 hours.

6/12/15: First impressions.  Finally got it to the table.  Overall seems good.  My biggest complaint is that it is a touch more fiddly than I would like.  The maneuver tool is clever, but with the table space cluttered with minis they are always in the way of using the maneuver tool. Also toggling a slider on the fighter squadrons every turn is a bit inelegant, mostly because you have to continually grab the mini by the base, especially if its in the middle of a dogfight with a bunch of other squadrons. 

Not sure I need to buy another manuever tool, but I certainly need another set of dice.

As mentioned by others, the cost of playing is going to be quite high seeing as you really need to buy additional ships for a decent gaming experience.

1/1/15: Pre-ordered after a heads up via this thread.  We'll see what happens.  (update: received at the end of April.)

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: FFG has done it again with this over produced , glorious game. The ship models are simply stunning and seem well worth the money. This is the fleet minis game that I've been looking for. The capital ships feel slow moving and cumbersome. The squadrons are not underpowered and useless, but instead must be dealt with because over time they can take down a capital ship. Both factions play asymmetrically, with the Imperials large slow and powerful while the Rebels are more nimble, faster, but less powerful. If the game didn't require such a large cash outlay, I would immediately add it to my collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Well paced and highly enjoyable and rewarding pre-painted miniatures game. Captures the essence of Star Wars fleet battles and is a lot of fun to play. No two battles are ever the same, this being one of the crux highlights of the title. Despite the publishing of the game coming off the heels of the likes of X-Wing, it has been exceptionally well designed. You will find many X-Wing players in the international community adding Armada to their collections or converting to it entirely. Expansions and upgrade cards are well balanced and offer an array of possibilities, allowing an indefinite amount of fleet builds and replay-ability.

I like the game. It's really good, BUT: It's crazy expensive. It takes 2+ hours to play. List building is complex. Set-up is complex and very important. All in all is very unlikely that you play this game very often. It takes too long and is not suitable for casual play. This reduces the amount of potential opponents and the occasions for playing this. On top of this you need to invest like 250 € just to get started.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
FFG did a terrible job of releasing this game.  There is simply not enough in the box to make for an interesting game.  However, it is easy to see that the mechanisms make for an interesting, thematic Star Wars experience.  Wave 1 is on its way to me at the time I am writing this, but this game simply should NOT of been released without those wave 1 expansions.

The Dice mechanisms in this one are cool, and its a nice change from X-wing (no defense dice).  The command dial is also really neat and offers up a nice additional layer.  I also though the way Squads interact made for some very interesting tactical decisions.

Deeper strategy than Xwing in my opinion which makes me like it a little better. Downside is long set-up time and intimidation factor for new players due to all of the fiddly bits but I do relish a good space battle on an epic scale that this game provides, though during the course of a game you basically have enough time for your capital ships to move forward and turn around unless you extend the game. Lengthy setup time has prevented this from coming out more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Rating was a 10 but I reduced it. This is a great game no doubt, and maybe my rating will change once the expansion packs come out. However the command dial rules for larger ships are not something I like. Also I really don't think that the rules for Bomber are appropriate, not to mention that X-Wings really should only have 1 bomber attack and not infinite. B-Wings, and Y-Wings should be the only rebel bombers in my opinion.

I was so keen on commanding a Star Destroyer when I heard of Armada.
Well, after I played it that urge was gone. It wasn't the blast I expected.

X-Wing and Armada are two different worlds. The one is fast-paced with dogfighting and adapting tactics while the other one is a slow strategy game where every move has to be well planned.

You really feel commanding structures of these capital ships because you have to select your actions several turns before you can execute them.

I like it not as much as I thought (I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love X-Wing) because it is clumsy and totally different from what I expected. I won't start buying the stuff like I did with X-Wing but I would play it from time to time if there is a chance.

Reduced the rating after 10 plays.

Reason: compared to X-Wings, Armada is far inferior.  

1) The painting of the miniatures are bad and the fighters aren't painted at all.  

2) The price is higher.   

3) The base game isn't balanced and the options are limited.  You need another base game or a few expansion sets to make the game fun to play.

4) 1 ship vs 2 ships are boring.  I give up after 4 plays.  Later, I get the wave 1 expansion and the game seems better.

So I reduce the rating for the base game because IMO, it isn't a complete game.

RATING: 6
Like X-Wing, Star Wars Armada wants larger games - 300 points at least. The 180 point matchup is mostly just a luck-fest. I played two games, one as the rebels I got three hits on my first 10 dice and got hammered. Second time I played as the Imperials, my opponent hit on 7 of his first 8 dice, his X-Wings were reliably getting 3 hits, and both games were more painful than fun. With a larger force you have more opportunity for the luck of the dice to even out and for fleet customizations to matter; the out-of-the-($100!)-box play experience is just dumb. But then you run into the stratospheric cost of acquiring a fleet. I realize Sails of Glory isn't Star Wars, but it's a much more interesting and satisfying game at a fraction of the cost. If Star Wars Armada was more evocative, that would be something, but honestly it's just not - the little movement device is quite clever, but it's still very stop-start-stop with most of the tactics revolving around timing (timing the range bands so that sure you get the first shot is a huge deal). Besides, massive capital ship combat like this just isn't a feature of the classic films. Would have been better to do a Clone Wars setting, where there are a lot more actions to base a game on.
---
Played a couple times. Kinda fun, and games are short, but the cost structure on this is totally out of control IMO, even at online prices. Compared to Sails of Glory - a much better and evocative game - the cost to acquire an interesting fleet is really punishing.

I think it's also problematic that the Imperials are flying a heavily armed brick, while the Rebels are trying to stay the hell out of the Star Destroyer's devastating frontal arc and chip away at rear shields. With the base set, the only real hope the rebels have is to get a mission that reward maneuverability. Otherwise there is no way in hell they can take out a Star Destroyer in a 6 turn, 180 point game, barring Imperial negligence. The defense tokens, high engineering value, and high damage threshold just make the Star Destoyer too hard to inflict meaningful damage on. Maybe with B-Wings? I dunno. It also sucks that the Imperial player's only real option at 180 points is to field a single tricked-out Star Destroyer with a variable number of pesky fighters. They're 1 point short of fielding two ships. That's probably a design feature, actually, but still lame.

Also the relatively small number and very limited range of upgrades, unique pilots, etc. in the card just seems silly. Building a Rebel fleet there were almost no meaningful choices. Even moreso than the X-Wing core set, this is only marginally playable, really, with just the pieces from one core set - a core set that costs a whopping $100! You're going to have to splash out for another $100 worth of figs to make the game work.

I think there is potential here, but I don't get a clear impression that FFG knew what they were trying to do with  this game, so it feels a bit like an unfocused mish-mash. I kinda like X-Wing, despite its weirdnesses, but it's not clear to me Armada can get over the hump given the cost. I think I would enjoy exploring the game space, just to discover the design and push around some cool figs, but it's just so expensive.

As a kid watching Return of the Jedi I always wanted to play out those battles and this game does it.  This game is great and is exactly what I wanted.  The fighters swarm, the rebel ships are quick, the imperial ships are fat and powerful.  The game really got going with the releases of the expansions and I can not wait to play this again.  After now having played it with the 2nd wave expansion, I can certainly say my love for this game feels rewarded.  The new choices and especially the new rogues and bounty hunters are a wonderful addition.

What decidedly tips the scales in favor of X-Wing in my view is firstly the much lower playing time (which makes it much more suitable for tournament play) and the much larger player base.

2017 - bought sort of on a whim, with the sale price on line. Looks cool, so now of course I've bought a bunch of expansions before having played my first game!

October 2017 - I love this game - it's very close to being my first ever 10.

RATING: 4
Wonderful, thematic and tactical - even though I am not a war- or necessarily Miniaturegamer, I do love Armada. It's prohibitingly expensive, it takes a lot of time to set up and even longer to play, it is often horribly fiddly and can get your brilliant positioning turn useless by accidentally shoving ships when measuring their route etc... still really really like it because it does something that a lot of games don't: it creates a hunger in me, a hunger to play it. 

Updated my ranking after ~15 games. Still love it, but I feel the game can (and is) so very frustrating in that I feel really really horrible after losing by a wide margin (and tbh, 10 out of 10 games I play end by concede since one side clearly wins) - and paying hundreds of dollars and a lot of time just to feel bad when I am defeated strikes me as a thing I should not spend much time with. I should clarify that I am usually not a sore loser (in this game, I kind of am) nor do I lose particularly many games. It just bothers me that there is such high potential for frustration in the game.

Update 2: Whilst potentially a good game, the lenght, not-so-evenly-distributed randomness and the fact that the game can turn into certain defeat very early even though there are still >1h to play more and more annoy me. After the initial fun I've had with it, I have begun to hate it. Not a single game I've ever played ended by counting points but by concession because the outcome was clear from turn 4 or even earlier on. It costs a huge amount of money and it's fiddly as hell - with millimeters sometimes making the difference between a wrecked ship and 2 damage. This might sound melodramatic (which it probably is) it is just horrible to see your are losing but not being sure of it and having to play it out. There is little statisfaction in a concession, no matter if you are the winner or loser.

All in all, my initial fancy of the game cooled down very much. Giving it 4 points strikes me as unfair, given that I had much fun with it, but the rating descriptions are 
 cear; I don't think I'll play it very often in the future - and maybe not ever again.

RATING: 4
Solid miniatures system for capital ships in the Star Wars universe. The order system is a simple and efficient way to represent both agility and energy allocation without the need for pen and paper, not to mention the shield dials. The movement and turn modes are elegantly handled using a special tool, and special abilities are represented with tokens. Overall the presentation is excellent.

The game is not without some issues. The generic fighters are virtually useless as far as I can tell. I can see no reason to ever get a fighter group without the Scatter ability. Physically, the fighters themselves can muck up the board a bit and here I wonder if pen & paper wouldn't have been better to avoid the inevitable knocking around of minis when you're trying to adjust shield dials in the middle of a scrum. Maybe shield tokens on the squadron cards is the way to go here if you have the cards.

The effect of the critical hits is a bit wild, and some can be decisive, but I guess it's thematic so you either love it or leave it. Of possibly greater concern is that the smaller ships aren't that much smaller, have nearly the same firepower as the larger ships, and can run circles around the larger ships. It's just not efficient to go for those larger ships against an opponent that knows how to maneuver. Maybe this will be solved as more ships are added and point values get adjusted. And of course, there's the fact that the base game is little more than a starter kit. Prepare your wallets.

That said, whether or not you think there are better sci-fi miniatures systems out there for capital ships, this one is at least decent, is relatively simple compared to other systems (keeping in mind that I'm coming from an SFB background), and has the theme many people are looking for. The nature of the game makes it less suitable for larger groups than [i]X-Wing[/i], however.

On a final note, this game is a case study in how you should take an existing system and rework it properly for capital ships instead bolting broken features onto an existing system in a cynical cash grab. Yes Wizkids, I'm talking about you.

Update: Had to drop my rating. The initiative system is too screwy, where you could end up with ship that repeatedly shoots an enemy ship, then moves before the enemy can respond. Plus, I think the scalability issue is a bigger concern than I initially thought. The base scenarios are too short, and the map too small, for maneuvering to matter very much, so it largely degenerates into a rock'em, sock'em dice fest. I'd rather play SFB, Starmada, or Talon.

Update 2: We tried again with a simultaneous movement system that gryfon came up with. It definitely improves the game, though overall I still find the game somewhat plodding. Plus, you still have the "furball" problem, too, and I think most of the admirals suck and aren't priced properly. So maybe a "6" with the changes, but otherwise skip it.

There is so much to like about this game, especially the duel scales going on between the capital ships and the fighter escorts.

I probably under rate this currently. Significantly better than X-wing. Slower paced, more thoughtful, grander scope. Armada feels more like a strategy game rather than a dog fight sim. I still find miniature games exhasperating as I am not very good at them and the pletherora of setup positions and special abilities throw me off a bit. I tend to prefer games that back, rather than front load the decisions but this is a fun game.

RATING: 8
Thematic space miniatures battle with massive capital ships. Expensive.

It's better than X-wing, but it has 2 flaws:

1.) Takes two hours to play
2.) Sneaking up on the rear of a ship does not always advantage you. Yes most ships have weaker rear shielding, but when you fire first and then move, ships that have been flanked will fly away before you can fire on them.

Otherwise very thematic and great fun to play.

This is a great turn-based, large-scale space combat game. The core set only gives you a taste of how the overall game ultimately functions. You will want more ships after playing a few games. That is only downside I see, the core sets you up for investing in future expansions instead of feeling content with your initial purchase.

I look forward to wave one and 300 point games.

This is the definitive space battle game for me.  The movement tool is intuitive and takes into account the size of the Capital ships.  I love the components, how you track damage with dials, on the base of the ship.  Again, FF took great care in creating this game, while SW X-Wing  is a dogfighting scale, this takes it back to the bigger ships, while including the fighters.

This is the best capital ship combat game I've ever played. It's expensive and takes a lot of table space but it's a very immersive and rewarding experience. When you finish a battle you want to dive right back in again. There's some luck envolved with the dice rolls, but luck can be mitigated to some extent with upgrade cards and admirals. If you've always wanted to partake in a large space battle then this is the game for you.

All of my plays to date have been with just the Core Set. It's fun, but as you might expect, be prepared to invest heavily in this game. You'll need many more ships to achieve the full effect. the Core Set gives you barely enough miniatures to play, and it doesn't feel like a complete experience. There doesn't seem to be enough firepower on the table to blow up capitol ships. Still, there's great potential here for those that do invest.

Miniature Star Destoyers on a tabletop? That's all I needed to hear to pick this one up. Its pricey (especially if you have no friends with their own core set - you will need two) but a lot of fun. This one is taking over my two player game nights, and is requested every time.

The game I've enjoyed almost as much spectating as playing. 
I love how you have to plan 2-4 turns ahead, and how you still have ways to adjust underway. 
It's a rock solid implementation of the Starwars feel in terms of strength vs speed vs agility vs weaponry... it works and is fun to play. 

However - it should be mentioned that the starting pack isn't really enough to get the true feel, a few expansions are needed.

I have had a great deal of enjoyment from this game. Buying one of each expansion gives a really good, diverse fleet. It feels very Star Wars to me to have a motley collection of different things trying to work together. Even the Empire didn't have every ship they wanted at any one time, perhaps barring Hoth and Endor. Definitely a big fan of this, even at the steady pace necessitated by the expansion price.

Gorgeous, which is really what minis are about. Just wish the fighters were painted.

Probably my favorite "freeform" minis game, but still a minis game, so other than painting, it has all the problems that scare me away from minis games, specifically measuring. It's especially bad, as the maneuver tool is kind of clunky, and you have to somehow measure through a bunch of fighters and those giant ship bases. Then there's the clunkiness of turning the fighter bases. 

Honestly, 80% of the fun in this game is moving Star Destroyers around.

RATING: 5
Interesting take on the x-wing model. Ships are larger so less maneuverable so there is a command stack of two-three preplanned actions so you cannot react immediately, so from a flavour point and an tactical point this works quite well.

The thing I dislike most about X-wing (and its ilk) are the movement templates as I cannot really work out where a ship is likely to end up. The flexible ruler in this system adds even more possibilities for movement, yet somehow it is less punishing in this game than it is is xwing.

The ship actions are nice and I like the three different die types for short, medium and long range, but overall I doubt I shall actually ask for games of this. I just don't see the appeal.

Got this for my brother X-Mas 2015. I think he'll enjoy it. After further review it's not exactly my type of game, but if the core cost drops further, I'd consider "investing" in a set to play against him rather than just using his set.

The only thing missing form this game is a 3 Foot/1 Metre long superstar destroyer.

Great fun, and potential.
Games are much longer than X wing, And take a very different approach. instead of quick fast choices indicative of dog fighting, here you must survey the field, and command based on things not happening for an hour.
The movement system really gives the ships weight; and the star ship models are pretty nice. not the fighters sadly, but the star ships. which are the star. 

I didn't say ships after. 
anyways, for me, a star wars war game is a great way to lose my wallet. good game.

Excellent theme; Great quality; great battle system and rule set. Kind of pricey. Too long of a process to play. Of the 3 games played none have been completely finished.

Army selection expect 15 mins of unpacking/ repacking and 15 minutes per 200 pt army list. 15-30 mins setup of your fleet and the board. 240 mins + play time. 15-30 mins tear down.

I like just about everything about this except the "edge of the universe" rule. Losing a ship because it touches a table edge just ruins the immersion with this game in ways that it never did with X-Wing or Wings of Glory.

Another variant on Wings-of-war with nice pre-painted models and build your force with lots of Characters and ability cards based on the Star Wars movies. The game is very good, rules are clear and easy to read and all the bits are excellent.

BUT:
Be prepared for a very fiddly game experience - nudging models and adjusting small dials - not for OCD player.
You really must get into the meta-game of list building, even for friendly games this will be a big part of the game experience.
The cost is exorbitant - the models are nice but there are a lot of expansions and the cost per model is very high.

RATING: 9
They nailed the system.  Generated a full evening game that was deeper and longer than X-wing but wasn't too involved.  Toy factor is great too.  Ships last for several turns so don't feel like large scale fighters but aren't so durable that you won't see ships melt under fire.  List building is fun, balance is good, and the parallel systems (fighter/ship) work just right.

One underemphasized thing about Armada is that it is actually pretty modular with respect to complexity.  You can pull all sorts of thing out and the base engine still works---upgrade cards, special characters, objectives, obstacles...

The real bummer, though, is that despite I deeply loving the game it is incredibly, ungodly expensive---particularly initially.  The core game is not enough game to give you a good sense of the system, it's just an iffy mini demo that doesn't leave an outstanding impression.  In my estimation, minimum purchase for a robust game is the core, a big rebel ship, a small imperial ship, and the fighter packs.  And that is a lot of money.  If you have those, though, you can do a bit of messing around and the game reveals its quality.

Behind the Star Wars is actually a really good skirmish game. The rules are concise and simple enough that we don't have to look at them during a game, a rare feat for FFG.

The ship/squadron dynamic is also interesting and opens many strategic possibilities.

It's still too much a dice fest for me so I'm not sure how often I'll play it, but it's a must try for those into these kind of games.

Side note after looking at some of the comments: No this game have absolutely NOTHING in common with Wings of War (besides having models on a table) and it has very few similarities with X-wing (besides being Star Wars and using the same collectible, upgrade based format). It is much heavier and less random than X-wing which for me is a good thing.

The epic scope of this provides a massive amount of potential. However, there are a couple things holding the core set back. The templates can be tricky to use and moving squadrons around capital ships as they fly by is really awkward. But most importantly, the starter set feels a little light on content. I hope a couple of expansions makes this a far better experience. I've since sold this one off, as it was too much of a money sink for a game that couldn't hold my interest.

What really bugs me is that this is a game about Armadas that comes with three (3) models (I am talking about fleet ships here discounting the tiny fighter plastics), i.e. this box is a starter. And it's not a cheap starter at all, it's actually one of the most expensive starters I have seen. And yet you can hardly play a meaningful battle unless you buy two copies (or you and a friend buy one each)... or unless you expand the game by purchasing additional models. Sadly those expansion models are to be found in the price range of around $30 (up to $50) per model. So go figure how much an Armada is going to cost you. And you really need two of those to tango.

With me the game will not ever see enough play to warrant the investment. I play board games perhaps 5-10 times before something newer and better arrives on the scene that captivates my attention (perhaps up to 20 times if it's "really, really the best thing ever, honestly"), and to me that's a decent investment-return ratio for a retail price of around $50. For the $250-$450 that are required to be able to stage a few reasonably-decently sized battles and have a little bit of variety on top of it, it is NOT worth it. It might be, if I knew for a fact that I would be playing this many, many dozens of times. Alas, while quite nice indeed, the game is not THAT captivating. 

If FFG had cut down the size of the miniatures by half or even just by a third, put three or four more of them into the box... then the starter would have been a proper game in itself rather than just the most expensive teaser ever.

Update:  Increased rating to 7 based on my house rules.  As published, I call it a 2 due to the issues below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ratings quickly fell with each play.  The core mechanic of one player always having initiative, combined with the move-then-attack sequence for ship moves makes for some highly stupid situations that totally wreck the theme for me.

Example - fast ship with short range weaponry maneuvers to the stern of a more powerful ship that has initiative.  The front ship activates, nails the rear ship, then moves out of range.  Small ship can't attack, moves close again, repeat and rinse.

The game resolves around setting things up so that your opponent has to move next to you, so you crush him with a short range attack when they wasted theirs at long range.  Is it fair and balanced? I guess so.  Is it evocative of the fiction or something I want to spend my time on? No, I think not.

Now, I do have an idea for converting this to simultaneous movement and combat - basically make it like Close Action.  I think it will work, but the rating is based on the as-published design.  Even with a satisfying set of rules, you still have the issue of the games's expense, the fiddlyness that comes into play when a few ships and squadrons operate get close to each other, and the generally lame way that non-heroic fighter squadrons operate. 

Includes Corellian Conflict.

Fun game where I think it gets even more enjoyable as the players gain experience and everything speeds up.

You need to swarm and not have some of the capital ships out of the fight.  You want to concentrate fire on one ship if possible.  I didn't appreciate the speed factors and my big guy tried to swing to their back side, but was going way to slowly.

I love this game! Having played quite a bit of X-Wing over the course of a few years, and now playing Armada a few times, I think I prefer Armada. Firstly, the ships are gorgeous, and the overall design of the components is fantastic from a usability standpoint. 

Don't be intimidated by the game's heft -- it takes us about 2 hours to play consistently, but is a very smooth, elegant design. Planning fleet maneuvers and coming out on top is an absolute joy. And, even in defeat I've had a lot of fun scheming on what I should have done.

Great game.

RATING: 5
Improvement over X-Wing with blending of squadrons and capital ships. Both seem to work well enough. I still think Star Trek Attack Wing is the best of the bunch (have not tried D&D attack wing yet).

I've played three times - twice with base game, once with 300 pt wave 1. The base game gives plenty of variety for a first play, unlike the base x-wing which felt very stilted and limiting, albeit at twice the price point. The last game took over 4 hours to draft our fleets and play 6 rounds. I find this unappealing for what should be a fast paced game. The prior two games took a good while, too. In all three, I think only one capital ship was downed.

You would think the pace would pick up as the game progressed along. It only lasts 6 rounds, too, so why the 4+ hour play time? The first two rounds are basically "drive the boats toward the objectives" as you and your opponent play a game of chicken with each other to get into position to score cheap points on the objective tiles on the table. This is resolved quickly, regardless of fleet sizes. In rounds 3-5 the game bogs down big time with the collecting of capital ship tokens in the prior 2 rounds to activate additional commands in future rounds. Now the squadrons can engage and this can take forever for resolution since AP sets in and then you have the abstracted movement of capital ships, then squadrons, but sometimes a flip-flop due to a command token(s). It could make your head spin the first couple of times. You also have to factor in your ships' initial and then final movement position at the end of your actions to both try and keep your ships' guns pointed at something hittable and to simultaneously steer away from enemy fire. On top of this, you have to rotate the capital ships so that the damage gets spread around to the other shields as much as possible.

The abstracted movement works well, with the improved ruler, but with 300 pt fleets there's a lot of plastic to negotiate. You usually don't want collisions, especially with your own figures, but sometimes it is best for the Imperial ships to ram the weaker Rebels to tie them up and to get cheap hull damage (shields are ignored when ramming). The Imperials can afford to take the punishment, whereas the Rebels usually cannot.

To further bog down the game, both fighters and capital ships seem resilient enough to withstand a couple rounds of punishment. So both players have  mostly a full complement of fighters and ships at their disposal.

After the fighting dies down, in round 5 or 6, our capital ships tended to "pass each other in the night." Once they were lumbering on their respective trajectories, they would never get the chance to fire upon each other since time ran out. I realize a lot of this was due to our mediocre skill in playing so far, but still, this is a tactical possibility for one side (usually the Rebels) to hit and run and then get away far enough so as not to lose a ton of points when one of their capital ships gets blown up toward the end. Is there something wrong with this tactic? Of course not. But when it "just happens" without either player consciously doing so, it sucks.

The final round had whittled down forces, with ships out of position and not much to do. You are just trying to pick off out of place squadrons for points to pad your score with. It was anti-climactic in each game.

For such a long game, it should be engaging, but I can't justify spending hours on it for only 2-3 good rounds of combat. It reminds me of a lot of war games I have played where you have to spend hours on the rules and cross referencing more rules, skulking about, and then there is this big firefight that takes not that much time. Then it is over. But it took over 3 hours for some reason.

If one person makes a tactical blunder, it will probably be devastating as there is not enough time to recover and they may lose a critical ship in the process. On top of this, the combat is tedious. It should be streamlined, and in some respects it is, but with all of the "tactical layering" on top that each player has to worry about, it becomes cumbersome and tedious at best.

Some more quibbles:

1) Squadron effectiveness. Your squadrons can only activate if they are nearby a capital ship. So this adds even more tactical complexity. More than a game like this should really have, imo. It just bogs things down too much worrying about the positions of all of your ships, whether or not they can activate, whether or not they can fire/get fired upon, and whether or not your capital ships can soak up the objective counter token points on board.

2) Some rebel ships only have to worry about one command dial. This means that they don't have to "program" into the future like the Imperials do (usually they have to program 2-3 total turns at any one point). Although they can only hold one command token, they can dynamically issue their main command to suit the conditions of battle. I find this powerful since the main command is so much better than a command triggered by a token. Also, if you select a wrong command on the Imperial side, and especially one that you can't use and already have the token for, you could be screwed since this could create a cascade of bad programmed move after bad programmed move that you can't escape out of.

3) Believe it or not, the old Star Trek disk wars game seemed to handle objective tokens better and was a lot more fun for me for some reason.

Again, I know that there are much better players of this than myself. But I just don't have the interest to persevere to get to that level of competence. I will continue to play it given the chance, as I am hoping that with more experience, the game resolves much quicker. Here's to "a new hope."

RATING: 8.5
Unlike x-wing there's slow deliberate movement, you have to plan sometimes 2 or even 3 turns ahead. You can really feel the weight of the combat and movement as you're just barely skirting past other ships and loosing salvo's on your opponent.

Requires a bit of foresight not to fly a ship off the edge of the table as it takes many turns to properly maneuver your ship.

Games tend to last a bit longer than x-wing games.

RATING: 9
A sterling game that I don't get to play enough. A fun, fluid, flexible system that feels epic enough without overstaying its welcome or getting bogged down in minutiae. Excellent toy factor, particularly once the ISDs of wave 2 dropped. Supports a wide range of "seriousness" of play, with fleet-app randomizers being capable of generating fun, viable (if still casual) lists and with sufficient options for more serious manual fleet construction and a pretty open "meta" allowing various approaches.

My reservations are mostly those intrinsic to the breed. Like any minis game, it requires an investment, and getting behind makes that investment steeper in some ways (though latecomers can sometimes benefit, as in probably not needing two core sets as many bought early on and being able to buy fewer ships of certain types whose role has been overlapped by other ships). It's also just a lot of stuff to keep, sort, haul out, and put away, especially as the waves pile up; within the game itself, the options multiply as expansions increase, making getting started harder and leaving new players with a steeper learning curve than that experienced by the pioneering players (a factor mitigated greatly, though, by the viability of many different fleet combinations).

Capital ship scale combat in the Star Was universe at last! I will say that this game is enjoyable, especially because of the quality of the miniatures however, this is also the game's biggest flaw. The game is both over-engineered and overproduced, leading to a price point which is ridiculous even for a miniatures game (The starter set, which includes only 3 large ships, is $100, even games workshop doesn't hit it's customers so hard.) I have enough ships (starter and all current expansions) to have a decent battle, however I can't recommend this to anyone but the type of gamer who drops a significant part of their income on games. Will update after a few more plays. Set is sold, loved the game but it never hit the table enough to justify either the cost of expansions or the massive amount of shelf space.

Great game. This is what I always wanted X wing to be. It's a completely different game really - you use cards with point values to select your forces, but the similarities mostly end there. Armada is much more deliberate, and it adds much more complexity to have lumbering capital ships slowly waltzing around while tiny fighters flit about like gnats. The orders and movement mechanics really nail the feel of an epic space battle. Actually- it feels downright cinematic.

The components, as others have noted, are very high quality, with painted cap ships and unpainted fighters. It will take no time to paint up the fighters, so I'll be doing that as soon as I can. The one downside - only three cap ships are included. This seems a bit sparse to me, especially after getting a huge pile of awesome components in "Imperial Assault."  Oh well.

I don't mind paying for quality though, and I look forward to picking up a few expansions. 

Overall, I'd probably give it a 9 or 9.5, but I'll round up because of the silly one star review.

Great light weight tabletop, but often there is not more than one capital ship blown up because you can negate so much damage and movement of big ships is really very slow. So in six rounds you don't really have many chances to get into shooting position.

I never would have bought this, but receiving in a math trade was fair enough, because I was intrigued to try it out. The system has its quirks and is really nothing to write home about, I might get a bit more out of it if I was totally onto minis gaming.
But the main reason I probably will never play a whole game is the fact that you need two core sets (and preferably some expansions as well) to go beyond the "training scenario". So the "core set" is a shoddy half scenario starter kit with a full game price tag on it. Oh please FFG.

Sigh... I'd probably buy into this, if it was not for my massive X-Wing collection. I just can not own both.

I have to say, I'm very surprised by all the positive reviews of Armada.  I assume that many people are unaware of what else is out there, but I can tell you, as starship battle games go, this one is pretty terrible.  A lot of effort has gone into dressing up a very dysfunctional set of core mechanics, and the result is a pretty game that is fairly meaningless and un-dynamic to play.  I know we all love Star Wars, but I would look elsewhere for your giant spaceship battles fix.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The Core Set feels seriously under-equipped. There is basically one scenario you can play with the Core Set. Of course, I expect most anyone diving into this one knows that it is going to be a money pit and s/he will need to buy expansion ships to keep it interesting and provide diversity in play. I do think the game play is pretty well fashioned with the larger ships having to plan far more in advance although the Star Destroyer maneuverability is horrendously painful.

Good system, but definately a money-sink if you allow it to be. You need one copy of the base game for each player if you want to play a full game; given that you share components. You should get someone to play with on a regular basis so you can each choose one faction each to expand.

This fixes so many problems from X-Wing.

The huge ships are beautiful and play amazingly.  The yaw tool is clever, the programmed command system is clever, and the starfighters are suddenly relevant in the bigger picture.  I'm looking forward to what this line has to offer.  Tarkin!!

Wow!!!  I played X-Wing a fair bit when it came out and enjoyed it.  However,  when I heard about this game, I sold off my X-Wing stuff and I am glad I did.  Even with just the core set, this feels so much more complete than one core set of the latter.  The scale is epic and the play is incredible.  Looking forward to picking up a few expansions when they release to fill out the fleets.  I will not go as heavy on this as I did with X-Wing, but I do feel there I a lot of potential here.

[b]8: Very good game. Rarely disappoints me. High on my request/recommend list.[/b]

Plays completely different than X-Wing and its a good thing. There is room on my shelf for both. Different tactics are required, both games I tried to play like an X-Wing game and lost horribly due to it. Bit more cat and mouse due to the shooting before moving and planning actions multiples in advance.

This is THE Star Wars game.  You really feel like these ships have inertia to them.  The need to plan out changes in speed and maneuvers, the swarms of fighters taking each other out and attempting to swarm the capital ships, the absolute devastation of a capital ship firing on the weak point of another... this game has it all.  It is slow, but that is the point.  Take your time and plan.  You are an admiral, not a pilot.

Really cool mechanics. Seems like a clear improvement on the Attack Wing engine. Movement rules are great, order structure is very nice, the capital X squadron ships are really nice.

However, the cost is too high for the mileage I think I will get out of it - I already have many 2 player games as is.

Personally, I do not enjoy the slots to add crew, equipment, etc, as it just adds to more chaos while trying to figure out what is going on the opponent side during a game (Yes, I am thinking the Start Trek Attack Wing ships that come with 5+ cards for you to track the combos that you may not be familiar with). This alone will keep me away from Organized/competitive play.

Pretty fun game with nice models and all, but boy do they slip and slide easily.  Can't get too worked up deciding ranges and all, else there will be a fight.  Nice blending of characters into the game.  Biggest gripe is the expense: I'd rather have cardboard units and a third of the cost.  The collectible aspect also lowers it a notch for me.

Expensive game with lots of detail that makes play difficult.  Takes time to learn.  Fun to play and great replay value.  Best if you know someone who can coach you, as there are some tricky rules. Best with 2 players but works well as a 3 player game.  Probably not for kids.   3.5 hours to set up, play, and take down.  If you play the same fleet many times, you can set up and play in 2.5 hours.  The Star Wars theme works well and adds a lot of atmosphere.

I do like the big ship action seen in video reviews but I cannot endorse the new miniatures strategy adopted by FFG (and others, but foremost FFG). Guess I'd rather play a real tabletop with longer lifespan and produced by tabletop specialists. I'm not at all sure that not going all the way is a good idea, and I suspect that real tabletop games are a bit cheaper.

I tried our Star Wars: Armada for the first time. The miniatures are great (though the smaller fighter/bomber squadron craft are curiously unpainted) and the gameplay is pretty different to Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game. 

That is, the game is more ponderous (I use that as a positive) and has much more an 'Age of Sail' sort of feel to it as large ships manoeuvre in a much more deliberate manner. Quite good fun. I lost both games as the Imperial player but enjoyed it. I would play again but probably won't 'buy-in' to the system.

RATING: 6
[b]Like:[/b]
-Epicness of 2 fleet facing each other

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Tedious
-Feels like you don't have much choice outside of the deployment
-Command dials, for a mechanic that's hidden from your opponent, aren't really surprising
-Not in scale

Can feel very epic, and I'm still very hyped about the idea about controlling an armada. However, by the time I spend about 400 euros on this game, I realised I could have so many more games that are equally (if not more) fun than this.

And while the command tokens are a pretty cool idea, the execution is quite boring. Sure, I won't argue that careful planning isn't required, but despite being hidden, the commands won't surprise you at all. The squadron command is the only one I can see catching someone of guard (and maaaybe the navigation command), but really, you're not going to have moments like "wow, I did not expect you at all to use the concentrate fire command now, good move!"

Even if you are the person feels like they make a big impact, you can't deny that there are other games that do these hidden commands much better. Take X-Wing for example, where it's as simple as not knowing if your opponent will go left or right. That's much more intense then your opponent powering up his shot or repairing, and at least you can act on it in X-Wing.

And here are a couple more things that got increasingly annoying the more I played:
-Lots of small tedious rules to learn for newer players.
-I feel like most of the game is in list-building and set-up, which makes the 2 hours it takes to fly the ships at each other feel tedious, and I feel like there aren't very many decisions to be made.
-Since this is such a long game, it's hard to bring this multiple times to the table, which is necessary for newer players to understand the list building and set-up parts of the game.
-Squadrons and overlapping feels... again... tedious.
-Once I discovered the miniatures aren't in scale, this really stood out, and I got annoyed by it.

TLDR; tedious

This game has been an interesting journey.  When I first saw X-Wing, it did;t really grab me and I said "if FF makes a game with the Capital Ships I'll buy that."  Three months later this was announced and I was on board.  But, as time got closer to release I got hedgy about it and ended up passing at first.  After some agonizing over the decision I finally decided to give it a shot and the wife picked it up at Comic Con.  I am glad she did.  The game is excellent and easy to get into quickly.  Really like having the how to play rules and the separate reference for questions as you go.  Miniatures are excellent.  Cannot wait for the new waves to come in.  If you have the money to invest and like Star Wars spaceships at all, this is a must buy.

Everything I wanted in a space navy battle miniatures game. For the foreseeable future there's nothing but good for this game and the engine.

The only problems with the game come from mechanical necessities and the intended focus of the game. Lone Starfighters are nearly insignificant, and the turn depth means a standard 300-400 point match will take two hours. It's just how it is.

But nowhere in that two hours is there player downtime or discomfort. The game is engaging and epic without tedious complexity to dampen enjoyment of the game. Would play without hesitation at almost any time.

Star Wars: Armada is an evolution of the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game, but the increase in complexity may be too much for me.

The only element that has been streamlined from X-Wing to Armada, is that combat is no longer a contested dice roll; the defender has almost no say in whether an opponent's shots hit.

Like X-Wing, the ship models in Armada are well detailed and fully painted. Unfortunately the scale of the models is all over the place. Also, the mounting posts on the small ship models are way too thin and I could see them breaking off very easily. The TIE Fighter models are also very delicate and difficult to mount onto their stands.

If I decide to keep Armada, once I get a couple of Imperial-class Star Destroyers I'm getting rid of the Victory-class one that comes in this set. I only want ships featured in the films and I don't think the Victory ever will be. They had the opportunity to show one hovering over Jedha City in Rogue One, where it would have made sense as a Victory is designed for atmospheric entry, but instead used an Imperial-class.

I thought the minis were going to be larger, especially the Star Destroyers. But once you start playing, you overcome and forget this feeling. Otherwise, the minis are really good, and the fact that they are painted goes leaps and bounds into liking them. The only thing I don't like is the box having a hole. I guess they had to show off this Star Destroyers :p

The comparison with [thing=103885]X-Wing[/thing] seems unavoidable. Unfortunately, I have not played X-Wing, but those who have say that this is a longer and more strategic game. X-Wing is a about skirmish and Armada is about a war.

It still seems an skirmish to me tough, which is not inherently bad. It's been enough for me up to now. The ships have very different characteristics and they feel very different. The designers have done a great job with it, they are not mere pile of stats. Also, each side has its own way of playing, the Rebellion has more maneuverability and the Empire packs more punch.

But the minis in the starter set seem quite limited. I guess sooner or later (for me, it would be rather sooner), players will get bored of using the same strategies and will need different ships to try something new. Of course, there will be plenty of expansions to satisfy this need. But considering we're talking about a starter set that costs €100, I don't think this should be the case.

If they keep this level of design with the expansions, this is going to be a really great game. But you will need an equally great investment to enjoy it. 

The game duration at 2 hours seems to be true for AP free players, which is a more than decent lenght for this game.

Suffers from comparison to the superior X-Wing game. This one is more expensive to get into and not quite as gripping. But not without merit. I'm hoping wave 2 (which brings stuff like Imperial Star Destroyers and the Millenium Falcon) will give it the depth it needs.

Update: Wave 2 _does_ greatly improve the game. Still not something I'm going to pick over X-Wing.

*遊戲進行最多六輪，有一方船艦被毀滅則結束，否則算分，每輪有四個階段
1.命令階段  所有玩家秘密使用命令轉盤轉到想要的命令放到對應船艦的命令轉盤最下方，起始時每艘船艦有幾個就一次轉完疊起(根據船卡上方的命令值會有對應個數)，命令有四種如下，命令轉盤效果比標記強，標記上限等於船的命令值，且每種一顆，行動階段每種類型命令只能做一次，但是可以結合標記跟轉盤來做加強
>導航 可加減船艦1速度值，使用轉盤可在調整移動尺上任意節點一格，每艘船有速度上限，最低0
>小隊 可馬上使用船艦卡上小隊值數量的小隊行動，小隊必須在中以內的距離，每個小隊可攻擊加移動，標記只能使用一個小隊
>維修 獲的船卡上的維修點並可使用之，1點可轉移船防禦值1點到任意區，2點可回復任意區一點防禦值，3點可棄掉一張傷害卡，標記則只能獲得一半(向上取整)的維修點
>專注火力 攻擊時可多丟一顆骰(跟攻擊骰的顏色要一樣)，標記則是可重骰一顆
2.船艦階段 起始玩家開始輪流使用一艘船艦行動，每次行動分三個階段
>打開最上方的命令轉盤放在該船卡旁，如果該回合不使用命令轉盤能力則拿一個對應的命力標記放船卡上並把轉盤放船卡上
>可攻擊兩個不同方位(上下左右四區)內的船或所有敵軍小隊(小隊要在同方位同距離)
*攻擊時使用距離尺背面量攻擊單位到目標單位的距離，上面有顯示可用什麼顏色的骰，船的不同方位可丟的骰數根顏色也不同，每個瞄準標記可以讓敵船的一個防禦標記失效，致命攻擊時如果有收到傷害卡，第一張開著結算，致命攻擊只有在攻守方都是船才有效，船艦攻擊小隊時要使用卡片上對應的骰子
*防禦標記 結算傷害前可翻面使用，紅色面的則移除，速度0時不能使用，每個防禦標記每次攻擊只能使用一次，且每種在攻擊始也只能使用一個 
  轉向:可用相鄰區的防禦值抵擋攻擊
  穿透:遠距攻擊時可取消一顆攻擊骰，中距離時可強迫重骰一顆
  護盾:傷害值加總除2(向上取整)
  彈幕:取消所有攻擊骰
*受傷時先削減護盾值，之後每個傷害拿一張蓋著個傷害卡，當傷害卡大於船體血量則船毀滅
>一定要移動 把移動尺打直，根據船的速度轉盤直看船卡上的對應欄，右下到上每一格代表移動尺的一段，-代表不能轉，1代表可以左或右一個角度，設定完將尺的邊緣貼其船的邊，然後將船移動到對應位置(移動完後不能在尺上)，跑出界直接毀滅
*船艦移動後如果重疊小隊，小隊先移走，然後讓對手擺在跟船艦相鄰位置，如果重疊船艦則少一移動尺一格直到不重疊，兩艘船都拿一張蓋著的傷害卡
*行動完的船把命令轉盤放到船卡上表示
3.小隊階段 起始玩家開始輪流選兩個還沒使用過的小隊行動，移動或攻擊2選1
>小隊移動直接使用距離尺，終點位置不能重疊任何單位
>攻擊對象為一個小隊或一艘船，但是當距離1內有其他敵軍小隊要優先攻擊之且不能移動(如果敵軍不再視線內可無視)
*小隊只能攻擊距離尺正面1以內的單位，受傷害時直接轉下面的轉盤
*使用後的小隊可把下方的啟動條推動表示之，如果其顏色跟起始標記同代表還沒行動過
4.狀態階段  把所有防禦標記翻回綠色面，起始標記翻面該玩家放下輪標記到場上
*如果六輪後沒有玩家船都被打掉則加總所有消滅單位卡片上面數字，高的獲勝
***進階規則***
*視線 攻擊時只能攻擊到能夠直視的位置，如果跨過任意區都不行，結算時使用船艦上的黃點，或是小隊上的黃點，如果路徑上有其他船或障礙物，少骰一顆
*障礙物 流星群重疊的船艦獲得一張開著的傷害卡，隕石群重疊船艦獲得兩點傷害到任意區，船站重疊的小隊或船艦棄掉一張傷害卡或回覆一點血量
*建構 使用船艦/小隊/升級卡片左下數字加總，組成船隊，總值小於300，船員卡名子左邊有點的只能用一張，特殊小隊卡也只能用一張，只有一個核心組時，升級卡隨機分發，兩對組件分數180
*組裝升級卡是要對應的船艦或小隊卡上有對應符號，且每個符號只能安裝一張該符號卡，有改裝特性跟頭銜的卡每艘船也只能裝一張，指揮官卡也是只能一張，且該船變成有旗幟的船，雙方至少要一艘也只能有一艘有旗幟的船，小隊分數不能超過三分之一，且要有三張不同類型的目標卡
*目標卡 開始時有起始玩家從對手的三張中挑一張成為這次的目標卡，核心組時隨機抽兩張由次家決定哪張，之後拿到的勝利標記每個值該卡左下分數

Boy, this is a dream come true. Since I was a kid, I never imagined a game like this would actually ever come about. But presently, X-wing fills the niche.

In other words, a few years from now, this might be my Grail game set.

Once you're past the basics it's a fun, engaging and strategic game.  The basic (learn to play) scenario is junky and they starter set leaves much to be desired.  But cost is a factor.  Buying the expansions to make real fleet combat fun is a bit steep, but well worth it.

So disappointed with the scale of this game like others are. Who wouldn't want to field a Super Star Destroyer? Purely rating my disappointment. The game looks really good otherwise. My rating will probably rise when I play it. I can see it playing better than X-Wing.

Update: OK initially p*ssed off with the scale I now see the beauty in the design of this one. Definitely up to an 8 now!

Update: A 9.5. Would of been a 10 if it was cheaper. 14/7/15

Update: A 10 26/7/16

Update: down to a 9 due to the errata from FFG. I hate that the cards become incorrect. I would prefer it if FFG actually got the play testing right for a change or simply resend the nexw cards to players free of charge.

Purchased via Coolstuff for $68 shortly after release in April 2015. My brother purchased also, we played first game on the 17th. A learning game, I took rebels with my nephew and we managed to win by one tie-fighter token essentially, with no internals on the Star Destroyer, and two on one of the rebel ships. The SD made a big loop around the board.

As our first game, we did not play with the Luke or special tie-fighter card, nor mission objectives, which would have added significantly to the game. Now that we know the rules well enough, looking forward to next game.

5-19-15: played second game with J. over weekend. I lost by a single hull point left on the VSD, lost no rebel fighters, but ran the bigger ship off the board by mistake. Great fun. I will be the only purchaser in my area, which will make this likely a special occasion game. However, so far it's a blast, and I'm giving an initial rating of 8. Giving some thought to ordering wave 1 from coolstuffinc.com shortly.

Pretty good, if a bit clumsy. Really fancy components, which is nice. This game takes the system initially developed for X-Wing and modifies it for capital ships. It does this quite well. But it's quite tricky as you have to plan your ship movement too far in advance. The way the fighters work is cool. Lots of dice rolling.

Beautiful components, and this game is so much deeper than the other flightpath games. I really enjoyed my first play of this game, but then my lack of 2 player game time resulted in this sitting on the shelf taking up a lot of space for little benefit. As time has gone on, i've also been less enthusiastic about games that use dice to resolve combat, so despite this being the best flightpath game I've played, it's still a little luckheavy for me. Pity.

Great maneuver tool and objectives build upon X-Wing as a space combat game, yet it plays nothing like it's predecessor. Capital Ships move slowly and no defensive dice means damage is more predictable. A strong, strategic game requiring you to plan your turns well ahead of time. All the models look great on the table. Fighters are a disappointment as they are too tied to capital ships, don't feel fluffy because they are not independently heroic and often not worth taking in the current meta.

I like the design of the components and stunning miniatures, quite usable. The fire first then move according to a programmed selection forces you to focus on position and where things will be a few turns in advance. More of an strategic flair than tactical. The order system and shield dials are simple and efficient way of representing maneuverability and energy allocation. 
Makes it feel more like ships than aircraft.

If you like a tactical-fleet miniatures naval game, this is it. There is a lot of strategy and no defensive dice to contend with like in X-Wing. The only con is the limited amount of objective cards in the base game. The objective cards and the point bidding for the first player and second player really uniquely flavor each engagement. FFG needs to release new objective cards in the latest ship expansions that capitalize those ships' capabilities.

Another winner from FFG and maybe better than X-Wing overall. The maneuver tool, the planning, and iconic ships and characters all work well. While the big ships look fantastic, I love the role of fighters in the system. There's just a lot to like about this one, despite the fact that I certainly didn't need another miniature game.

larger scale version of Star Wars x-wing.  This is more centered in large ships and special powers.

One significant difference is that you shoot and then move, rather than move, then shoot (as in xwing).

On my first game, I was outgunned, but stayed in the battle due to some lucky roles, only to be destroyed in the end.

Rating is pending.  I desperately want to love this game since it's so pretty.  It isn't that complex, either.  At least what I've played of it.

But I don't know if I'm a miniatures gamer.  I would have rather have had a hex map, I think.  Even though the tool is a nifty way to move ships, I hate actually using it.  I can't help but to bump ships or squadrons out of position.

Also, I'm a bit miffed that there aren't more dice.

I want to love it because of the engaging theme and visuals.  But the very models that make it beautiful also make it a bit fiddly for me.

Still, more plays are warranted.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
We've played it once, but my first impression is very positive.  I'll be giving it a go a few more times this first weekend, and then I'll rate and comment further.

UPDATE: I played it four times over the initial weekend.  I like it very much.  It shares a few small similarities with X-Wing, but it's mostly different.  In a good way.  

I am, however, getting beaten regularly by my two sons, age 5 and 7, and I'm pretty sure Vader's going to crush my trachea for being such an inept starship captain.  

I think the game will benefit very much from expansions, as the materials in the box don't have enough variety for my taste.  We'll see how that works.  It's a solid 8, and has a chance to rise as expansions come out.

UPDATE, 5/27/15: I've played a bunch, now, including a couple of 300 point games with the expansions.  I really like it.  It's simple enough that my two boys (ages 5 and 7) can play against me.  They've won a bunch of games, too.  We're trying out different strategies and learning what does and does not work.

One thing we're finding: Fleets without fighter cover are vulnerable.  Always take a few squadrons!  Also: The fighter mechanic is well-integrated with the rest of the game.  It works smoothly and adds to the fun.

Overall, it's a screaming good time.  We're enjoying the heck out of it.

UPDATE, 2/23/16: The more I play this game, the better I like it.  Up to a 9.  The boys and I have great fun with it, and they love the fleet-building aspect.  (So do I.)  The relative lack of variety in the game is getting fixed, and all of the ships handle in different ways.

Like all miniatures games, it's growing as expansions come out.  So far, they've been winners.  I really like Armada a lot.

The activation system forces players to visualize how the board position will develop from round to round.

In many games, when a player activate a piece, the piece moves, then fires. This allows the player to move the piece into an advantageous position to increase the chances of hitting and to decrease the chance of being hit in return.

In Armada, players alternate activating pieces, but each piece fires, then moves. So in moving a piece, a player is hopefully placing it in an advantageous position for the following round. This requires considerable long-term thinking.

Star Wars Armada Game Review
My friend Dave and I have been playing Star Wars X-wing by Fantasy Flight games off and on for a while now. For those of you who don’t know that game was a simulation of snubfighters from the Star Wars universe going head to head in space battle. This is a standalone expansion on that theme. Instead of single pilot ships this game takes you into the world of Star Destroyers and Corellian Corvettes. Lots more ptch ptch instead of pew pew. 

The Components:
This is another winner for Fantasy Flight Games. This company continues to do great things and make great products. Only complaint is that the box this game comes in isn’t very good for storage of the game once you have put everything together. Dave had a comment about the wash on one of his ships being a little light, but I didn’t have that problem with mine. Also that’s an easy fix to bring out the detail in the model if one were so inclined. One of the best parts about this game is that the ships come pre-painted. The squadrons of Tie fighters and X wings are a solid plastic color, but the ships are all set right out of the box. That means you can start playing it right away. There have been some reviews that say you need two core sets to play. I don’t think that you do. Now that there are expansions out for the game I think it is better to go with those than to get another core set for the ships and play tokens. 

Game Play:
The game attempts to replicate capital ship combat in space. The players have six turns in which to blast their opponent into space dust and wrack up enough victory points to win. Points are based upon the point cost of the ships and squadrons. Each of them have a base price and can then be modified by crew and equipment upgrades. Dave and I played the learning scenario twice to really get a feel for the mechanics of the game before getting all wild eyed and crazy with the upgrade cards. The starter scenario is easy and quick to play, as well as providing a quick introduction to the game mechanics. Dave and I took our times playing to make sure that we got all the rules right and didn’t accidentally make assumptions or default to X Wing rules and we still got two plays done in about 2.5 hours. 
Both of those plays were very different in their execution. The capital ships have command dials and command tokens. The commands that can be given basically are your orders to the ship. In each turn the ship may fire, twice from two separate firing arcs, and move. The commands allow you to so other things as well. Things like, command squadrons, repair the ship, speed up or slow down, or concentrate your fire. The larger less mobile ships have to plan these commands several turns in advance so you have to think about not only where your ship is, but where it will be in the next couple of turns. For instance the Victory Class Star Destroyer has a command of three. So I had to plan my moves out three turns in advance, and after each turn place a new command dial underneath the stack I already had. Additionally instead of using the command on the turn you reveal it you can take a command token that matches the command. These tokens can be saved and used later in another turn, they are less powerful than if you use the command from the dial but they allow you to have an element of flexibility in your strategy and execution. 
In the first game I attempted to use my Star Destroyer as a giant space fist and just punch Dave with it over and over. Well, it’s slow and hard to maneuver so I went with Nelson’s strategy and just tried crossing the T with it. Basically, go real slow past your opponents ships and blast them to hell. My tie fighter support was just kinda flying around all pew pew at stuff and playing space opera with Dave’s X-wing. I smashed one of his capital ships but the other one smashed by VSD to pieces. At 85 points that was the end of the game for me. 
On the second go I changed strategy slightly. Instead of flying slow and punching everything in the face as hard as I could I started thinking more about taking damage than giving it out. I spent one dial on changing speed and then the rest on repair in order to restore shields and move them around on the ship. This allowed me to roll slightly less damage when I attacked, but also to absorb more damage. The difficult part was that I only had one capital ship while Dave had two. A Nebulon Space Frigate and a Correllian Corvette. So all of his ships were maneuvering against me, I had no interference. I also deployed my squadrons a little better and used them to pin Dave’s X-wings so that the Big guns could fire on big ships. Ptch! Ptch!
Another aspect of the game that is cool are the defense tokens. There are several types and not all the ships have all of them. In X-wing you roll defense dice to try and counter your opponents attack. In Armada you basically have to take the dice roll on the chin. There is no counter roll to save your bacon, you just take it. (That’s why I didn’t join the navy. Digging a hole in a boat doesn’t give you more cover.) The defense tokens allow you to mitigate the damage. They can be burned to redirect the damage to other shield sections, evade the damage at longer ranges, or just brace. Brace you just basically grit your teeth real hard grab something on the bridge and take the punch. The sour face you make allows you to half the damage that you take. The neat part of the defense tokens is that you can only choose one per attack and then you have to flip it over. If you use it again in the same turn from another attack its gone for the rest of the game. So you have to decide what and when you want to use something. Also your opponent may roll the accuracy icon when they attack. If they do they can then choose to nullify your ability to use a defense token they determine for the resolution of their attack. 

Overall while the game is two dimensional and the ships drift around a bit on the mat because of the maneuver tool the game uses we had a lot of fun playing this game. The price tag on the core set turned me off on this game however, this was also the case for X-wing. Dave and I decided to give both games a shot when we found places that were selling them at about half off and free shipping. That settled it for me and I already have a couple of expansions for our next game when we up the points and use upgrades. If you are interested in getting the game take a look at Cool Stuff Inc and Amazon. Both of them have sales going on right now on the core set and some of the expansions. If you are playing the Imperial faction I recommend not putting the whole maneuver stick together as you won’t have anything that moves that fast and the stick gets in the way when you are moving your ships. Also, because the expansions have new upgrade and crew cards I would recommend that you get those instead of another core set to round out your fleet. Optional things after that would be another set of dice because the core set doesn’t really give enough dice without rerolling some. 
Fun game, will play it again, and will be interested to see what other ships come out as the game grows.

16-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Wow. I severely, severely dislike Armada. It's like they yook everything in X-WING that I liked and removed it.

Armada focuses on the big ships, that is cool. In the basegame, there are 3 of those ships and they lumber around in space. The small ships, the X-Wings and Tie-fighters are way more maneuverable. 

I don't like that there are two types of units with their own movement and combat mechanism. I don't like that you have  measure range 3 times for a shot. I don't like the shields and ability to deflect. It just feels like too much of everything.

Pass for me, I am sorry to conclude.

Armada is my son and I's signature game.  The mini-s are awesome, the game is dripping with theme, the feeling of inertia with the larger ships is super fun, and the long-term view of strategy with your moves in the game result in a very satisfying experience.  My son and I get some Star Wars music playing on the side and can happily lose hours and hours of time into playing this.  Best Star Wars game so far.

Just the big picture tactical fleet game I was looking for. More accessible than Battlefield Gothic, as well as the most refined (and fun) out of the troika of similar games I've played: This, Wings of War and X-Wing. Component quality is through the roof, and the level of interaction between fighter squadrons and capital ships is stunning. Irons out the wrinkles in X-Wing that I didn't quite take to, and sets a more grown up tone to Star Wars space battle - without reducing any action.

Only played a few training games so far, reserving rating until I get some more under my belt - and until Wave 3 hits. 

So far, though, it actually FEELS like a naval game - without fighter cover or AA you get bumsavaged, the fire-then-move design and command dials make planning much more relevant, and escorts are more nimble than the big ships even though the biggest are still as fast or faster. Having to coordinate the majority of fighters from ship-based CICs also plays out well.

X-Wing reloaded, and not badly at all. For some reason the greater scope delivered by engaging a star destroyer makes me prefer this.

Nice take on X-Wing. A solid space game. As many chits - or more - than X-Wing.

Everything about this game is great. The models look fantastic. The ships move like hulking monsters. The command dials reflect the problems getting a behemoth to respond to a changing battle. My only complaint on this game is the price point. The only way I'll own this game is with a big pay bump.

Really interesting and fun tabletop game but what you get in the box is incredibly limiting, and to get the most out of it, you need to spend the same amount all over again, and this is just unfair - sell me what I need to play the game and set the price accordingly. OK, so if you are a regular on BGG and you read the forums, you'll know the contents are limited, but if you just casually picked this up in a shop, you are going to find it very limiting.

Sold September 2015 simply because there isn't enough in the box to get any fun out of this, and I refuse to spend £50 to turn it into a game.

Really good, solid system that is proven in X-Wing and other flight games out there.  Minis are fantastic.  But X-Wing beats it out by a mile for me.  The planning is weird because for some ships you are starting out by planning half of your game.  I wanted it to be longer in rounds, but the 6 you play already takes a long time to play.

Armada is not an easy game to rate. Firstly, it *does* feel pretty incomplete without multiple sets. In fact, even with 2 base sets (and so a £120 outlay!) there is a distinct lack of cards to vary your play experiences. Without limited turns, I'm also wary that Star Destroyers can essentially flee and heal up making the game never ending (I'm generally not a fan of healing in games) but it's difficult to accomplish much in 6 turns (and by much, I mean actually destroy a Star Destroyer). In our games, the edge of the table represented a bigger threat than any player and I'm not sure Star Destroyers can turn effectively in a 3x3 playing area.

That said, the implentation (and abstraction) of squadrons is an unexpected delight; they play quickly and easily and yet offer some real tactical choice, both in how you build your fleet and how you attack your opponent. The Rebels and Imperials also seem to play pretty differently.

So... Praise. But wary praise and with some concerns for long-term appeal.

I play demoed this at GenCon 2014 and was waiting for this to come out.  As time went on, I became less and less excited about the game and ended up cancelling my pre-order.  I only received the game due to winning an X-Wing Store Championship, with one of the prize support prizes being an Armada core set.  We went through a few games, and although I think it's fun, I believe the core set is priced $25-30 more than it should, or enough stuff should have come in it to run a 200-250 pt game for each side.  I'm not sure I'll get everything like in X-Wing, maybe just stuff I want to play with.

A huge improvement over X-Wing and fixes most of the issues I had with that game. However, I'm not sure if I'll be keeping it because it's still extremely fiddly and there are a lot of little situational rules to remember. I hate little situational rules.

Update: I like the idea of the core system and the customization here, but the fiddliness of checking range and movement just kills the game for me. When you put the range or movement marker down you usually have to move a bunch of stuff out of the way. Then when you move your ship you might have to move more stuff. I much prefer a hex-based grid system, so Battlelore 2.0 gives me pretty much everything I want in this type of game (lots of customization built around a solid gameplay system) without the cumbersome range and movement.

Sold.

Traded up significantly for a big lot. Played it once, thought, "Wow, I really underestimated it." Then I immediately put it on the auction block. I can't afford a game where the expansions are between 15-40$ each, and there's  like 5 of  them each wave.

Sorry,  FFG, but you're selling Cadillacs in a recession.

I managed to pick this up for £40 in a sale and it still left me questioning the value for money. Compare this to the amount of game you get with Imperial Assault (yes very different game, but same company and theme) and it becomes hard to recommend this at RRP. 

Still, as for the game itself, I'm a little disappointed the delayed programming of the ships doesn't have more bearing on their actions (it only really affects their 'boosts' for that turn) but it's still fun and certainly worthy of the Star Wars license. 

However, like the X-wing core set, it's cleary an amuse-bouche for a larger game and, as such, it becomes harder still to justify the price.

We like this better than X-Wing, though it's a much bigger time and money investment. 

Where X-Wing in tactics, this game is strategy. The limited number of rounds, pre-planning, and hard-hitting combat emphasize the need to think ahead, wrangle your opponent where you want them, and get out once the advantage is lost. 

Feels appropriately massive.

Disclaimer - I have played X-wing a ton (which Id rate a 9 (GOOD)), as well as Dystopian Wars (7.5 to 8.25)(ENTERTAINING - GOOD), Leviathans (5/5)(MEH.), 

Armada is a real treat. Yes its expensive, the core set really is only worth 60 bucks (maybe 50 dollars of minis and 10 dollars of dice/etc) but I dont care about cost. What I do care about is that it delivers a great fleet game experience. Big ships feel like big ships, and fighters feel like fighters, a bloody furball of fighters tearing each other apart with the big guns of the cap ships thundering by once they bring their best firing arcs to bear. I have played approx 4 times now; after the first play Id have rated it an 8, but the elegance of the system hits home more and more with every play, so I now rate it a 10 (EXCELLENT). Cant wait for the Wave 1 ships to come out. 

My gamer friends would be the first to tell you what a harsh critic I am of games, it is rare to find a game I dont house rule to some degree. SO it is saying something that I can find no rules I would change with Armada. (or X-wing for that matter).

Star destroyers are a blast. Unfortunately, it seems like the rogues are favored in this game. They’re faster in general and have more long range weapons. And X-wings kick the crap out of tie fighters. Yes, they cost twice as much, but it just never pans out it seems. That being said, I’ll play the game. But you really want your friends to chip in some cash and you need expansions for the imperials or you’ll get stomped every time.

Not terrible, but the price point is absurd, and with such an imbalanced core set, players are on the hook to drop over $100 minimum. The ruler for ship flight is nicely done, but with other ships in the field, it was a pain to lay it out. Ramming seems more effective than tedious combat.

RATING: 8.5
Beautiful ships, but some extra highlighting and washing seems to really bring out the detail. Squadrons are butt-ugly out of the box and I would say a minimal paint-job is mandatory to make them look good next to the ships.
The game manages to capture the capital-ship maneuvering and commanding feeling very well and squadrons feel like fighter clouds facing off in the void between the capital ships. The game system is completely different compared from X-wing. The tempo is much slower and there are no more simultaneous plotting. Somehow this still works well and outmaneuvering is still possible.
It is a very pleasant game but a proper timeslot needs to be reserved for this. I do not see this played under 2,5 hours. But with the time to spare this has a lot to give.
A slight annoyance after the first game was that the rebels felt really underpowered when playing a 300p game with 2 core sets. This I'm sure will be fixed with expansions but at this point it didn't feel like Reb300p==Imp300p. However, if my memory serves me right a good balance wasn't found in X-wing either until after a few expansions were added.

I've played it a handful of times now but it just seems too repetitive and clunky. Friend and I both have a core set so we put them together to play a bigger game a couple of times as well. We could see the strategy opening up if you bought a bunch of other ships but even then, this "objective based" game ends up being a slightly varied death match each time so it gets old. Also suffers from a runaway victor. 1 mistake and the other side takes over and dominates. Comparing this to Imperial Assault, I'm not sure why I'd ever play this when a good skirmish of IA is so much more appealing. Even fresh out of the core set there are more options with IA to make it more fun without spending hundred extra on. 

But long story short, it's fun, but not THAT fun.

Although I've always been a fan of the CMG Starship Battles, I have to concede that the non-collectible aspect is nice and the game has more depth in terms of strategy and tactics. As for fleet battles in the Star Wars universe, it's the only game in town worth having now.

Great game, I found it very easy to learn. Is not nearly as complicated to understand as some make it out to be. It has depth of strategy, but a good learning curve. 

I share the opinion that the base game is a little low on dice. Some of the ships in the base game require you to roll 4 blue dice but they only give you three. 

I love the officers and the ship upgrade system. I really like the fact that you can have different versions of the same ship to add more variety.

Fantasy Flight has created the single most accessible miniatures ship-battle game. Simple rules, easy fleet design, intuitive mechanics.

This game was underwhelming and I’m happy about that. I purchased [b]Star Wars: X-Wing[/b] near when it came out. I bought the extra ships and expanded it to the point where I needed a big Plano box in order to store all of the ships and even that didn’t fully contain it. I also bought the fancy acrylic templates. I later realized that I never played the game and it was just collecting dust, taking up space, and it represented an expense that I wasn’t happy with. I was much happier when I sold it.

When I saw [b]Star Wars: Armada[/b] I knew it would be a similar story. I’d end up collecting more ships while never playing the game and I’d eventually get to the point of expansion fatigue and sell it. 

With all of this baggage in tow, I tried a quick learning game thanks to my friend Tim. I think this game [i]does[/i] have a lot going for it. I love the movement of the capital ships and how the bigger the ship, the more planning you have to do. Fantasy Flight most definitely achieved a very different feel from [b]X-Wing[/b] and they should be commended for it. 

However, there’s a lot I don’t like. Let’s start with the squadrons. These squadrons are your X-Wings and TIE Fighters and have different movement and shooting rules from your ships. They  move in straight lines through the capital ships and they can only shoot at a very short range (which admittedly makes sense).  The problem is there are so many of them and they’re in the way of your capital ships. Additionally, they have these little dials to mark their health and these sliding tabs that mark whether they’ve been activated. Both are great ideas, but the execution means you’re frequently going to accidentally move or knock over squadrons.

I think there’s a lot to like here for the serious player, the person who can invest a lot of time (and money). However, for a casual player, especially one who doesn’t have a lot of tolerance for the fiddliness of miniature games, I’d say this is a pass.

pro's: -> great feal between squadrons vs captial ships
       -> nice mini's
       -> very strategic
       -> like the objectives system in the game, to 
          build your fleet around objectives.
       

con's: -> expensive game .base game is not worth 100$ imo
       -> not enough dice in core set (need to buy extra
          set which is another 10$)
       -> squadrons not really painted... could have had
          been dealt differently. 
       -> complexity (i guess for some people they prefer
          x-wing because much easier to play then armada
          If you don't mind to plan 1 or 2 turns ahead
          and you like complex games this is for you. If
          you don't like it to be complex go play x-wing.

Bought this when it was released and bought all the wave 1 stuff. I like the game, I am trying to like it more than I do. I feel like the 6 round limit simply isn't enough. There have been plenty of games where not even one capital ship has been destroyed, it's possible it takes 2-3 rounds just for the ships to even meet. I hope that Wave 2 brings some more bad ass ships to make this game even more fun.

This fleet scale battle displays the latest advancements in the flightpath combat system. The most obvious change is the replacement of the handful of maneuver arcs with a bendy maneuver ruler.  I think this game adds the attack wing critical system? Seems like a lot of battle to manage for just 2 people. I'm sure this could be played as teams.  I have a lot of fun with flightpath games, I'm sure this is no exception.

As a long-time X-Wing player, this system has been a refreshing change of pace.

More of a war-game than a board game, Armada is about the mighty capital ships of the Star Wars universe duking it out for supremacy.

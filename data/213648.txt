Included in a C3i issue bought for other components. It looks like an interesting game at strategic level though that it's not my preferred scale. I'll give it a try sometime in the near future.

This is another, smaller game based on Mark Herman's Empire of the Sun.  Unlike Plan Orange, this is very balanced and quite interesting to play.  It basically is a fight over the South Pacific, centered around New Guinea.

RATING: 8.5
Very tense all-out brawl, immediately violent, a scenario with very little finesse. Enjoyable, playable in 2-3 hours, great replayability because of the card draw. Probably balanced although I've seen 2 in 2 wins by AP despite tremendous losses.

Tight and clean. Is it a good intro to EotS? Yes but only because the choices are more limited than the full game, still requires a good understanding of the full rules.

After I played Plan Orange several times (I don't own EotS and have played it ever) I thought, yes, that is a nice game where I must not learn to much more rules.
But after my first game I must say, the spark will not jump over to me. I think it is a little bit overruled. After Plan Orange I thought, yes, EotS is a possible game for me, but this game frighten me to test EotS.

Slick system and wets my appetite for the full EotS  game.  If only you could find one without costing a fortune or waiting forever for the P500 in process!.

RATING: 8
A nice mini scenario for EotS,  Not sure if it has enough staying power on its own, but a much better fit than Plan Orange for learning the EotS system.  Downside is having to wade through almost the entire rulebook, anyway, in order to play.

Arrived January 2017. C3i magazine issue #30. Very excited about this game; Mark Herman does the Solomons campaign! Woot!

Also, picked up a copy for my brother, and we got around to playing it in the fall of 2017.   Lots of fun.  Looks like this is our gateway drug to EOTS!

RATING: 9
A truly excellent intro to EotS.  Small map and few counters; can be played in 2 hours or less if you have the rules down.  Smaller (4-card + FO) hand and fewer strategic concerns mean a new player can focus on learning the rules, experimenting with how to conduct an operation, playing with probabilities, etc.  There are enough interesting paths for the Allies to explore to keep experienced players coming back; I have about 10 solo games complete and no loss of interest yet. 

But this is still Empire of the Sun, which means it's not a simple game.  It constantly gives you decisions involving trade-offs.  You have to optimize your logistical resources: operations, battle hexes, activations, and ASPs.  (Although ASPs are less of an issue than in the full game.)  Even with a limited number of counters, it takes some real thinking.  And cards will still have a big impact on the flow - so every game has a different story line; it's not a game where you win by learning the optimal strategy and then executing it better than the other guy executes his.  If all this appeals, buy it, you won't be disappointed.  If not, buy something else!

It plays extremely well solitaire, both for fun and as a learning scenario.  Yes, you lose the card surprise element, but it's not hard to envision how you would play a hand if you didn't know what cards were in the other hand.  And on those occasions where there are multiple paths that seems logical, you can always roll.   Overall, the smaller scope and hand size - even compared to the short scenarios is EotS, make it a more manageable solitaire experience.

Japanese are a little harder to get excited about than the Allies, but this is true (for me) of any strategic-level Pacific theater game.  You will definitely learn to play good defense with them, and you can easily fit two games in a Saturday afternoon if both players know the system - so just swap sides and go by net VP differential if you want a fun, competitive play experience.

I like Empire of the Sun, but it is big.

The part of the Pacific war in which I am most interested is New Guinea and the Solomons.

This is smaller than EotS but uses the same system, and focuses on the area of my greatest interest - all in a magazine game.

A great introduction to the EOTS system, although you do need to go through the entire rulebook, which in hindsight, may be a mistake on GMT's part in that a scaled down rulebook might have helped more gamers get into this.  The cards are more critical here than in a standard EOTS game as there are limited options instead of the whole board to play with.  The beauty of it, however, is that you can quickly set up another game if things go bad for one side early on.

I found this to be a great entree to the Empire of the Sun system. It's not simpler or simplified, but it's more focused and you can concentrate on the bread and butter mechanics rather than grand strategy.

As to C3i #30: I don't play COIN or Pacific games, so this time around there was only a little on offer for me: the T&T scenarios and the Alexander scenario/counters.  Still, I think it's a great magazine and will continue to support it.

Very convoluted rule book, even for a war game; the order in which the rules present topics is dubious at best. (Disclaimer: I learned this game by reading the rules to Empire of the Sun, which is essentially the same except for omitted sections that don't apply to this game.) This is a pity as the game is surprisingly straightforward despite the multiple supply rules, multi-step combat, and a bit wonky combat mechanism.

I'm not a particular fan of CDW, but I was impressed with the cards in this game; there seemed to be not many crazy, destabilizing cards (i.e. bard weather: your opponent loses his or her entire turn). Most of them give you a slight advantage on combat if you can satisfy the restrictions of a card or involve shifting a counter on a track, giving (or removing) a small benefit.

I really do like the idea of the existence of this game, a undiluted, independent scenario for a monster war game -- with no dependencies on its parent. Essentially, it enables me to try Empire of the Sun without a big time commitment.

Technically a Scenario for Empire of the Sun. Reuses many parts of EotS. Nice to have the complete package since I don't own EotS. Rules can be a slog; book is for EotS and not tailored for this packaging.

From the C3i Mag.  A gift from Jim.  This is EOTS light, and a nice intro to the larger game.  I'm sure that's why it was put out, and why Jim got it for me.  It worked, I now have the EOTS on my P500 list.

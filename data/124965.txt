I own all five of the Dungeon Command sets.  (Blood of Gruumsh, Tyranny of Goblins, Curse of Undeath)  Likely my wife's favorite game.  A Euro feel brought to a fantasy game that includes a great deal of strategy.  I find it a more entertaining version of Summoner Wars.  

Throws one instantly into a skirmish with asymmetrical teams.  No dice rolling, as in D&D and it works really well.  Plenty of tension as you anxiously await to draw more cards.  Playing strategically matters. 

Play Time: 2 1/2 - 3 hrs.
  
(Never again play with four players...way too long. 4+ hrs).

Above average game play.  Fantastic miniatures.  We regularly utilize the miniatures in our table top RPG sessions due to their detail and accurate representation of Monstrous manual entries. 

While the D&D big box game minis are good, these minis are better as the have the great sculpting as well as being pre painted.

Low-medium complexity fantasy miniatures skirmish game.  It is themed around D&D 4th edition, but has little in common with that game.  Creatures automatically hit when they attack and do a fixed amount of damage (which can be boosted or reduced by card play).  It's fine, but doesn't excite me.  I would prefer to have dice rolls to liven things up.  The miniatures are quite nice for pre-painted minis.  Including cards to use the minis with the [family=9547]D&D Adventure System board games[/family] is brilliant.

This game plays very well, with adequate chance for battles to swing back and forth depending on timing and unit positioning. There are noticeably different characteristics that make each army different while remaining balanced. It will become better and better as more and more sets come out, provided that WotC can maintain balance across those factions.

I don't like to deck build. Fortunately, playing the warbands as they were designed is thematically sound. It feels similar to Summoner Wars, but without dice, and with different resource management mechanics. You don't build magic, just try to put whatever you need out when you need it, as much as you can (given your limited leadership).

The miniatures, while not stunning, separate Dungeon Command from other skirmish games. The fact that this game can almost always be found for less than $30 makes it a good value for what you get.

Specific to Heart of Cormyr:
 - Interesting synergies with dwarven defender make the unit a powerful tactical tool.
 - Slow speed on certain units means taking advantage of cover or positioning.
 - War-wizard can be played in many ways to take advantage of attached cards.

Never really got too much into it, I like the Forgotten Realms universe, but was never much for tactical miniatures combat.  I do admire the way this game works, though.  It's like a combination of a dungeon crawl, a minis game, and Magic (it utilizes the stack for effect resolution).  Maybe someday I'll get around to getting more into it, but I'll probably just scalp it for minis.

Very good lite skirmish wargame - set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe - combines miniatures skirmish wargame mechanics and Magic: the Gathering card play. There are no dice as damage is a fixed number but chance (a simple reality of life and warfare) and "fog of war" is added in the cards which allow game changing moves, extra possibly catastophic damage, and damage avoidance just when your opponent thought he had you cold!

Comes with pre-painted miniatures - very good sculpts with an Ok paint job that you will probably want to fix up and enhance. The modular board is the same as the D&D Adventure game boards and is very good quality as are the other tokens although the heart of the game is very much in the minis and cards. Card art is good although not outstanding fantasy art. The rules are clear and easy to digest and the iconography is simple and clear.

Game play can become a bit abstract between experienced players - placement/positioning and the pre-determined combat results limits replayability - maybe it needs dice?!

Well presented: very nice pre-painted minis; quality art on cards; map on hard stock. I love the fact the that monsters can be directly integrated into other D&D board game sets (Castle Ravenloft, et al) without rules adjustments (brilliant in its simplicity).  I like the idea of various factions and hope that WoC pursues further sets. Basic, fun stand alone skirmish game. The small map squares, however, do not accomidate the minis.

Much better game than I was expecting. Minis were not fantastically painted but good enough and better than plain and i can always touch them up later. A really close battle were I managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat because my son got too cocky and wanted to be up close and personal for his killing blow. Looking forward to more battles to come.

RATING: 9
Dungeon Command has been compared to games like Star Wars: Epic Duels, Summoner Wars, and Magic: The Gathering, and there are certainly elements of all of those here. Dungeon Command is primarily a tactical minis game, with movement and positioning being crucial to victory. However, it is also a card game (hence the Magic comparisons) and hand management plays a big role as well.

Each player controls an army of 12 figures and a deck of 30 or more cards. A figure has an inherent movement, attack value, and special abilities. But all of these can be enhanced by playing cards on them. Knowing when to play these cards and how to position your figures are two of the biggest choices the game offers. Despite having diceless combat, almost nothing in this game is calculable, which I love. There is never an obviously right answer for how far you should move, whether you should get a treasure, whether to stay together or split up, to play a card or not, to cower (which hits your morale) or not (which kills your units), and so many other choices.

For a relatively simple rule set, I think Dungeon Command offers a ton of meaningful choices and a depth of gameplay that will require many games to master. None of that even takes into account the additional layer of customizable army/deck-building. This one is a winner.

Played with 2 players and 1 Faction Pack, this game is terrible. My Girlfriend and I were really looking forward to this, and the game seemed sluggish and fairly predicable after the first few turns.

Think Summoner Wars with cool figures.  The card mechanic is really interesting too.  Depending on your hero, is what your loyalty will start out at.  The minions that you have must have a total of equal to or less than your loyalty. You have to balance whether you would want to bring out your minions or wait for that big character to fight with.  I really enjoy this game and if gives you that fix you need when you want a short miniatures battle.

I was sent a review copy of Heart of Cormyr and the Sting of Lolth sets and a pal and I took a shot at it. Unfortunately I can't really say much about it. This might be the best skirmish-level miniatures game out there but I have no way of knowing because skirmish-level miniatures games are just not my thing. They're worse than not my thing -- I don't enjoy playing them that much. I try to play them but end up ever so carefully moving my guys around and then watching them get slaughtered because I just never have any idea what I should be doing. They're not fun to me. This one didn't change that, but again, that doesn't say anything about this game in particular because for all I know, people who like this sort of thing love this instance of it. I am probably going to pass my review copies on to someone who will have a better shot at enjoying this.

Dungeon Command is grossly under-rated skirmish game pitting two factions against each other in a dungeon or outdoor setting.  Game play is card driven and there are no dice.  It very much has a 4th edition D&D combat feel but without the d20.  

Heart of Cormyr are the "good" Dwarves, Elves and Humans.  There is a very nice Copper Dragon.

Everything I'm saying about this game goes for its expansion packs as well: Sting of Lolth and Tyranny of Goblins.
Strategic, turn based, it revolves around your deck composition and how you manage your card resources.
I played this game a few times now and overall I think it's a good one.
Pros: no random numbers involved, fast paced, and somewhat customizable. Rules are fairly detailed and simple in essence.
Cons: some rules need tuning (using minor actions you can create some truly OP combos that cannot be countered in any way), the same goes for armies; tilesets tend to be limitative due to lack of variety. Most of all, expansion packs are plagued by what I call "Overpower Factor", or OPF: in order to make the new armies desirable, they keep increasing the power of new armies' powers and cards, which leads pretty fast to completely imbalanced games.

* I track all Dungeon Command plays, and my overall thoughts on the game, on Curse of Undeath (the first faction I tried). I want to know how often I play it, not how often I play each faction. *

I dig this faction. I like the theme (adventuring party, more or less), the way they want to be together and have their enemies clumped as well (and the abilities that make those things happen), and the card mix in their base deck. Good stuff.

2 / 5 - Fair.

Some good ideas here, especially around mix & matching sets and the maneuver aspects. However the game is spoiled by its reliance on order cards to generate excitement and tension - combat is 100% predictable without them and they tend to run out quite fast. The expansion to the adventure system games doesn't work well because these are *heroes* not monsters, introduced into the game through an event card which, obviously, rarely happens.

I bought the first 3 boxes at once. I have to say that painted minis are awesome and with those pretty detailed tiles are responsible of generating an immersive atmosphere for the game. I like the card driven mechanic over the dice to resolve every combat, but find the game is still missing something, maybe some more interactions between terrain and creatures and not only one path to victory. Anyhow this is a good game that my group enjoys, however I find it too long for what it offers. DC works well with up to 4 players, with six or more, the only rational choice is to form teams of two players each.

We are starting to test a home made expansion: Magical Event Dice. Consists of two dice with several symbols that every player must roll when one of their creatures ends an activation on a magical circle (max 1 roll per circle per turn). Interesting how the game changes with this little push your luck variant, several different things can happen, some prizes but also some punishment.

HoC is the box I like most, I just feel more related with good guys.

Not your average miniatures game, and quite a good one based on playing with untampered (uncustomized) base boxes. Its card-driven gameplay is a pleasant surprise; it won't show much subtlety at first, but the factions, or even the different leaders offer significantly different strategies. 

For going the extra mile, and including cards for their D&D Adventure line for full compatibility makes it a very easy decision if I wanted to stay for the upcoming boxes in the series.

Whether or not you have a vested interest in the D&D franchise Dungeon Command makes for a great, light skirmish game, with deeper tactics emerging through devious card play and positioning, and which can be played in under an hour with a little experience under your belt.  With a ton of new expansion material in the works too, there should be a wealth of further replayability and variability beyond what is already in the box.

When I first bought these dungeon command games, I did it only for the miniatures and the tiles, as assets for d&d games. Yesterday after almost 4 years, me and my friends, decided to give them a shot as game.
The game is really interesting, both generals and the races can change a lot the game. It can be played with 3 and 4 people (we tried it both). Havent played the 2 player version yet, but the multiplayer system was great.
Strategy,  wargame, great miniatures and great cards. You have a lot to think, where to move, where to hide, what cards to use, which one to attack and with whom to hold peace. I am glad to have this in my collection. Loved the experience and my friends and wife, already ask for the next gamenight. Try it with multiplayer and have fun!

On the negative side, this game is missing it's reason-to-be.  I'm not sure where this game fits into the larger gaming scene.  It's just another thing you might dabble in, even though it is very good, it doesn't have a ton of magnetism in a glutted market.

Also, the cards have decent art but are a bit thin, and the boards are prone to warping, and the figures are a bit small and uninspiring.  Production values obviously match the price point...still, it isn't a top shelf production physically.

Good tacticals without a lot of bluff. More interesting than Heroscape in game mechanics, like the way it has been offered more than the D&D miniatures game.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great replayability and variability due to:
--- random card drawing from deck
--- re-positioning of 4 board pieces
--- (so far) 5 very different factions 
--- different positioning and thus strategy of your warband every time
- Beautiful painted miniatures
- Beautiful cards
- Factions are balanced
- You can assemble your own Warband from more than 1 faction

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Lacks mechanic that will make fighting necessary (one player can just hide in convenient place and "wait until the other guy will step into the trap").
- Game under 3 hours are very rare
- There is no point to play it as 3-player game (there is no game mechanic against "hide and wait" strategy until other 2 players fight between each other)

It's Miniatures the Gathering. Mechanics remind me of Magic, you need to buy multiple sets to play at a tournament levels, yes, there will be tournaments, and yes, there are promo cards and figures (alternative art). The sculpts are reused from the D&D Miniatures line. If you play HeroScape, see if HeroScapers has made army cards for the miniatures. If you play the D&D Adventure System, DC comes with Monster cards for the miniatures (Heroes of Cormyr has Ally cards). Heroes has a ridiculous purple and gold paint scheme.

Bought after Summoner Wars for a similar type of game but it seemed to me and my group that it was more of a math problem than a game.

Counting spaces to keep things in range of your archer and such.

Summoner Wars gives the same tactical feel without the unnecessary complexities.

Fun game, but the price is a bit steep considering you need to have any 2 different sets to have any real fun. And forget customizing unless you want to buy a duplicate set... Seriously, $50 MSRP just to customize ONE army! and to play a good game with 2 of the 5 factions out at this time your at $100.... They need to include duplicates in each set at this price point. Or at least sell individual characters and command card sets. That said, I still bought all of them once and enjoy playing...

Had no interest at first. The packaging made me think it was a sort of D&D Module. But then I heard it was a miniatures skirmish game, and was compatible with the Adventure board games. 

The gameplay is a perfect hybrid of a minis and card game. I was pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!

This warband when played with the right strategy (and a hint of luck) can be almost impenetrable, but only if you get it right. Even though the creatures are not as exciting as some of the other factions (they are "only" heores after all) I really enjoy playing with them. Placing is crucial with them and can pay off so well. And the copper dragon is pure awesomeness!
I have a criticism concerning the order cards though, there are 3 DEX characters in your deck and only 2 order cards with DEX quality on it, that makes it a bit unbalanced.
(more concerning DC in general in my Curse of Undeath comment)

The Hero army looks very reminiscent of the classic adventuring party and this manages to hold up pretty well in a skirmish game, even if they need a dragon to boost their strength. I was mildly concerned about replayability, but since each turn you should only see about a third of your order cards and maybe a half of your creatures this should easily last 5 or 6 plays - at which point you change up the opposing army.

It doesn't feel particularly chaotic either, though I'd really only recommend the 2 player game...

Descent little skirmish game. If the intent was that you could customize your own army ala Magic or something, then they went at this the wrong way. Each set retails at $40 and there are no individual or partial sets for purchase. 

The offerings aren't bad, but I don't really get why they went away from Heroscape. They could have stuck with Heroscape and started including the cards like they did. Rather than the map tiles, they could have just made the sets use the Heroscape set and gotten much better sales and broader appeal.

Somehow I got into my head that this would be a light and quick skirmish game. What I got instead is a skirmish game with Magic The Gathering cardplay, and it is actually quite an involved game because of this. The cards and the positioning of the mini's make Dungeon Command a pretty tactical experience, and the sets that we played in our two player game (adventurers and undead) played very differently while feeling balanced at the same time. The mini's are pretty good, as is the box insert. The rest of the components, especially the box itself and all of the cards, are regrettably flimsy. Artwork is nice and evocative. All in all an interesting game, but one that faces stiff competition in the fantasy skirmish genre, especially since it does not play in less than an hour.

Rated for its integration with the D&D Adventure games. Have combined this with Wrath of Ashardalon. The other Dungeon Command games come with monster cards to integrate into the D&D games - this one comes with lots of ally cards. It does only come with one encounter card to summon allies, so I have thrown a few more into the encounter deck. Allies really add a lot to the game - our first ally draw in the latest game was a dwarf cleric, who was hugely helpful in healing the odd point of damage. There are a couple that spawn two minis at once, which is also pretty cool. 

So far I'm not that fussed about playing the skirmish game of Dungeon Command, but maybe one day I'll give it a try.

I'm liking it, dice or no dice.  In fact, it's the fact that there's no dice that appeal to me.  The theme is there but there's less immersion into it which is fine since I see this game as a fast fantasy slug-fest with D&D figures.  It really is MtG meets D&D minis.

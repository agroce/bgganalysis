My 4 year old loves this game.  He cannot stop talking about it.  Talk about the perfect game to play with your kids.  Monster factory is fun, the monsters you create are wild looking, and it's so fast to get out and put away.  Simple tile laying, but keeps kids interest for sure.

While I give it a 7 for what it is (a kids game) it likley deserves an 8 or 9. My 5 and even 3 year old can both grasp the game, and they as well as my nieces all loved it.

RATING: 8
This is a kids game, and it's rated as such. It's a tile laying game, where you connect tiles much in the same way as in Carcassonne. The scoring is simplified and you are building funny looking monsters instead of cities. The game is recommended from 5 years, but we played this with our 3 year old daughter, without the score keeping. It's a lot of fun, even for an adults.

Rated as a family game. Bought this as a family Christmas present and it is great. My four and six year old boys love it. My wife and I are happy to play it too. There is a lot of luck and other players can mess you up a little. The boys also enjoy making monsters with the tiles. At the moment this is my boys favourite game and the first that has held my youngest's attention, he has won more times than me. I wouldn't bother playing with just adults though.

Good with the kids.  Random draw mechanic with the ability to sometimes mess with other players monsters is well placed. 

The little on loved seeing how the monster builds came out silly and giggle through most of the game.

Wouldn't play with just adults, but as a good filler or quick game with the kids, you could definitely do worse then this one.

RATING: 6.7
Light game, clearly targeted towards children...children of all ages.  I gave this a shot since I'm already a fan of Dominion, Kingdom Builder, Nefarious & Gauntlet of Fools.  I'm glad I did.

The artwork is colorful, silly and just a little gross.

Plays something like a very simplified Carcassonne, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it both distinct and entertaining.  Not the deepest of games, but a couple of strategies are possible.  And it plays quick enough that two or three games could be played consecutively before moving on to something else.

This is a children's game designed at least in part by Donald X of Dominion fame, so I figured it would be worth checking out since I'm hoping my kids will like games as they grow older. It's a tile-laying game where you are trying to create funny looking monsters, so basically Carcassonne. You score 1 point per tile in your first monster created and then 1 point per tile with eyes on it in any subsequent monsters. (I think I have that right, or it's something similar at least.) You do not score points for any incomplete monsters. Not a complicated game and I'd imagine kids can catch on pretty quickly. My only real complaint is I feel like not scoring at all for incomplete monsters could be frustrating for some kids, as it is certainly possible you don't complete your first monster so you'd finish with 0 points. I know it doesn't change anything really but perhaps giving more points for the completed ones and half points for incomplete would be better. I'm sure they play-tested and this worked best of course, but hey, I bought the copy so perhaps we'll do a house rule when the time comes around. Or it will be just fine the way it is!

RATING: 5
Components: Great art; each tile is bizarre and fun to look at, creating winding, disgusting creatures.

Experience: A bit much for the 5-year-old I've played, for whom I simplified the scoring, and had to assure him that these weren't scary monsters. Playing with an adult, we found it was all too easy to complete my opponent's primary monster while it was still tiny, and to constantly fork his minion, buying me all the time in the world to grow and complete my primary monster. Not much here for adults, but I think my 5-year-old gamer will like it more once he's six.

This is a really fun little game. It's easy to learn. It's got some humorous artwork. Each player draws tiles to create some random main monster. Even so, there's strategy involved because you can play tiles on your opponents monsters too. It makes some of the freakiest funniest monsters. This game is probably better with more than 2 players, but is still fun for a few laughs.

Rated as a kids game. Kind of a like a more confrontational and kid-friendly Carcassonne. I don't think my 4-year-old really understands the scoring, but I'm sure he doesn't care: He just likes building his monsters. But the adults can play along and get to make some interesting decisions.* That's a really nice combo. 

*And at least in our house, the adults tend to sabotage each other, such that they can't complete a monster and have a score of 0 at the end, resulting in a win for one of the kids. 

Update: My almost-3-year-old now likes this just as much as his older brother. He "plays" solo, just pulling tiles out of the bag and building a huge monster.

Kids game where you draw tiles to build monsters.  Not much depth, but a fun diversion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun, light, tile-laying game for the kids.  With more players, becomes more difficult to complete many (or sometimes any) monsters.  More experienced players will choose to put the 3-4 sided pieces on their opponents, making it difficult for them to complete their monster.  This can be frustrating for young players.  Often the winner is the one who has the biggest first monster, since it's worth one point per tile.  Additional monsters aren't worth much - only one point per tile that has an eye on it.  And after completing your first monster, you lose the ability to play tiles on other players' monsters.  Kids love examining and explaining the silly looking monster that they have created at the end of the game.

This game was a must have! The game is so simple and also it's very humorous. You pick a tile to begin and similar to Carcassonne style of play, you will connect tiles together based on matching pictures. You may play a tile on your monster or on your opponents monster. Once you complete your monster, you may begin a minion. The original monster will count 1 point per tile, but the minions, if complete, will count 1 point per monster eye (actually only 1 eye per tile is counted). 

The tiles are nice quality and should stand up to the test of time. This is a great game for kids and adults. I believe the difficulty of the game is actually completing your big monster. If you do not complete a monster it does not count for any points.

This has a lovely feel to it when playing with kids, drawing a tile and placing it on your monster, growing it in all sorts of ways. There's enough closure pieces to allow each player to finish their monster (get it as big as you can, you'll score 1 point per tile) and then start a new monster, but each completed new monster only scores a point for each tile with an eye on it, so it's all about making your first monster as big as you can, but closing it before the tiles run out. It has that exact same feeling as trying to close out a big city in Carcassonne, looking and hoping for the right tile, sometimes expanding to have multiple closure points, gradually closing each one, etc. As such, it's easily a game you can also play with adults - because you're allowed to place on other player's monsters, you can decide to try and shut down an opponent's monster, or try and make it uncloseable. Which don't make it no Carcassonne, it's far to simplistic for that and is a filler only, but being able to work for both audiences is a plus. For kids, this is great game, great art, got the Rivers, Roads and Rails feel but much shorter and more fun given the theme.

This is a fun filler game that first all shouldn't be taken too seriously but is a great family filler.  That being said there is some strategy and tactical moves that matter throughout the game.  There is a really push your luck aspect to when trying to complete your monster and great interaction since you can play on others.  This should work well with young kids too.  Overall, this is just fun and funny as these monster get built.  Definitely made everyone laugh as we played.  the only draw backs of this game is that sometimes the game just plays out the last few turns as the leader can't possibly be cause but this only extends by 5 or so minutes.  Just good quick entertainment that can be good for kids or as a beer and pretzels game.

visually appealing it kids with enough depth to keep adult entertained (at least, while playing with said kids).  A game I'm always happy to play with kids, but which I wouldn't recommend at a table of all adults (although it still has some value).

for adults: 5/10 (good for a kid game)

RATING: 1
I rate this game as a "gamers game", and not a "family game". If you have children, this is definitely a game you should consider trying - your kids will have fun building monsters! However, this game is probably not suited for your gaming group - it's unfortunately depending only on the luck of the draw. In my games, one person did want to end his monster quickly, but never had the chance - either the other dumped their garbage, or the tiles she got were miserable. I don't think that my decisions were bad at all - in the end, drawing the tiles was the only thing that decided the game. I can definitely see, how people like this game, but for me, it was random tile-laying.

It is a pretty simple game, seemingly aimed at younger kids, but it's good simple fun. Not that I would seek it out, but it is very cute! At the end, the monsters look great!

--- Summary ---
Tiles have cute monster parts drawn on them: purple bodies, green arms sometimes with hands holding things, connected to 1-4 edges of the tile. Each player chooses a tile to start with; the rest go in a bag. On your turn, draw a tile and either:
- add it to any player's monster, if possible (ie if there are any matching edges free)
- if your own monster is done, you may begin a minion (or add to one if you have an incomplete minion)
- if no legal plays available, remove the tile from the game and draw a replacement

The game continues until all tiles have been played. Players score only for their completed monsters:
- 1 VP per tile in their starting monster
- 1 VP per minion tile with any eyes pictured on the tile
Most VP wins!

Despite it Not being much of a game and having an extortionate price tag (for a few tiles) the monsters are great and it wiles away 20 minutes

RATING: 7
Monster Factory is a very simple, clever, quick-play game that combines creativity, imagination, and tops it off with a bit of the “gross factor.” Take turns placing tiles to create your first monster followed by its creepy little minions.  

Monster Factory has a clever scoring mechanism wherein you get one point for each tile in your “master monster,” as we like to call it. Once you finish this first monster, you can then create minions where you get one point for each tile that has at least one eyeball on it. Be careful, however, as you get zero points for an unfinished monster! 

While gameplay mostly focuses on each player’s own creations, there is a very fun aspect of either attacking or helping, depending on the player and depending on the “feel” of the particular round! For example, if a player is about to close off his master monster, you could swoop in and add a four-sided tile that makes it a whole lot harder to close off. What makes this component even more fun and flexible is that you can also help other players. So, if your 4-year-old is struggling to finish a monster, you can place just the right tile on her monster to help her finish it. This selfless play has really taken off with our young kids who now seek out opportunities to help each other build up or close off each other’s monsters. We now have to remind them, “Now, that’s really nice of you, but you want to build up your monster, too!” =-) 

This game is hilarious to play with young kids, especially those who like random, gross, dangerous, and silly things. With each added tile, they’ll act out the monster then laugh and laugh! Overall, I give Monster Factory a 7 for its quick start, quick play components, its endless combinations of monsters, and how much it makes kids laugh. I initially scored it a bit lower as replay value isn’t super high for me; however, I bumped it back up because the replay value is very high for our kids. As this is primarily a kids game, that’s what matters most. 

Quick Tip: Find that right balance for your first monster. You don’t want to finish your master monster too soon, or you get very few points for each individual tile as opposed to only tiles that have an eyeball in them with the minions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Draw a tile and play it to your own (or someone else's!) monster. Only completed monsters score; your first scores 1 point for each tile, subsequent monsters only for each eye tile.

Surprisingly vicious for a kids game, there's a lot of take-that screwage where you play horrible cards against opponents. Also a lot of luck in the tile draw.

Oddly charming. Take turns drawing tiles and adding them to your, or to someone else's' monster. Once finished, it is worth a point per tile. If you've finished, start building minions which score for each tile with an eye on it. Again, play onto your minion, or someone else's.

It's a nice mix of take-that and push your luck. It's also pretty luck dependant, but plays in about ten minutes so I'm okay with that.

Just seen how expensive this is to buy. Wait until it's a third of the price and then pick it up.

This rating is weighted a little for play with kids, but there is a genuine game for adults here.

The artwork is what makes this a special game. And I have had two of the funniest gaming sessions ever playing this game. The artwork alone doesn't make me laugh, but it is a good place to start.

One nice thing about the game is you have the ability to play a tile on your own monster or another player's. This rule is there to allow you to attempt to screw your opponent so they have a more difficult time completing their monster. However, with younger kids you find them using the rule to help you or to make your monster more awesome. I think this is awesome. 

I have recommended it to several people looking for kids games and now I will recommend it to you.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.5

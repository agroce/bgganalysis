Very fun and very fluid game!  The painted minis are beautiful, the components are nice,and the whole game  doesn't take too much place on the table. One of my favorite game!

Simplistic game, but rules are vague and game play uninspiring. Note a bad game, just not something I'd pick over other games.

Solid tactical Soccersim aka Street Soccer, but with individual Player Stats and superb graphic presentation, spiced up with a fantasy setting.

company fails to deliver, fails to respond to status requests, fails to offer refund.  While the concept is good, execution falls flat.  I wouldn't recommend anything from Helvetia Games or anyone who develops for them.

Very nice game ! The mechanic is really good, the game is way much simpler than a Bloodball but you still have this fantastic feeling when you score a goal. The cards, board, and figurines are awesome. I really like the design. Unfortunately the price is a bit high but this game can be found much cheaper if you search a bit. One of my favourite.

A good soccer-themed boardgame with amazing minatures! I hope that there will be expansions with more teams available. 
I can't wait to try the tournament mode

This is the UGLIEST GAME BOARD I AHVE EVER SEEN.  It has no peer. Cheap paper on the board. Picture looks like someone vomited on the board.
The board has a crease down the middle, like board games from 1950. it is NOT backfolded. 

The sides are peeling off the bottom sides ofthe box.

ALL IN ALL, ABYSMAL PRODUCTION VALUES

At first I found the amount of luck a bit unsettling. Then the smooth game flow grew over me, and with a 30 minutes duration a revenge match is never far away. Also, it's a cool spectator game, perfect for killing time while waiting for the late 1830 4th player.

The game is fun and very fluid. It features all the components of a real-soccer game including offside, injury, yellow cards, substitution, etc. The game is much more tactical than you can think when you read the rules, for example the management of the stock of boost for each player (i.e. its physical condition)  add a lot of depth to the game. The painted figurines are very nice and of excellent quality. The opportunity to play championship and cups including the progression of your team and players seems extremely interesting. Look forward to play the next game ;-)

Basic game...very easy and quick. Advanced...not so easy, takes a while but worth it. Lot of strategy despite all the dice rolling. If you are a soccer (football) nut definitely worth a try.

This game does everything it sets out to do pitch perfect. Playing the game feels like playing a soccer game. However, the details of simulation do not get in the way of compelling and easy to grasp game play. This game is thankfully free of gritty details like facing, zones of control, and all charts. The components are also wonderful, with fully painted miniatures.

My thoughts about this game I have already expressed in a review for BGG. But, keeping it short, this is a very nice game. Think of it as football (soccer) plus dice rolls. If you like both, give it a try. Unfortunatelly, my wife doesn't like football very much. :(

RATING: 4
Badly needed more development.  The rules make the game seem like it's more than it is, especially the geek version.  It's too difficult and risky to cause a turnover, and too easy to get a good shot off.  Passing is a certainty for all but the longest passes, and so this game turns into a race down the field to get a good shot, followed by another race the other way with a good shot.  It's clearly going for a "[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15985/blood-bowl-living-rulebook]Blood Bowl[/url] for soccer" vibe, but it isn't as well balanced and it definitely is missing the fun factor.  The production is nice at first glance, but then you realize that most of the players on the teams have the same miniatures, and it becomes silly to try to track who is who.

RATING: 8.8
Combines soccer and fantasy, two themes I enjoy. Small map and team size keeps the game tactical. Unit cards allow door a family friendly soccer match or use the advanced side to get into the strategy of which figures will be best in a given situation. My choice for fun sorts game of the year. The goal scoring mechanism is brilliant and handles the long shot issue very well, mitigating the luck involved in deciding soccer goals. The painted figures are awesome and the box comes with a fitted insert. Excellent production value. New teams are planned for the future, but it plays just fine with the ones in the box.

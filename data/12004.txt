RATING: 6
Comment after 1 play.
The game feels very much like Settlers, but with more randomness in the adventures, compared to the dice rolls.
It took a long time to play.  Maybe 3 hours including the rules description to three first timers.
It was fun, but felt like the randomness determined the game more than anything else.
I wouldn't rush to play again.

Teuber is still playing with the same mechanisms - just shuffles them around and tries to add a new one each time. The character/role-play aspect in this didn't really grab me and as such I'd rather just play Settlers or the often-overlooked but excellent Anno 1503

Here's a game that gets really mixed reviews.  I think it's a very clever game with a lot of little things that I enjoy.  The only real minus is that the game tends to play a little long and there isn't much interaction and trading amongst players like most Settlers games feature.  However, this game adds an RPG element to a series of games I enjoy.  This game just feels unique and I will enjoy this one for awhile.  The character editor also adds life to this game, thumbs up there!  Wish I got to play this even more!

RATING: 8
Somewhat interesting game with role-playing elements.  Although not as interactive as Puerto Rico or YINSH, there are some subtle interaction elements (in manipulating the goal tiles and the adventure cards, especially in a game with fewer players) and a direct one ("Met", quite significant to time their use well and to prepare for your opponents' use).  In any case, the movement system is clever, and there are quite a few interesting decisions.  However, there is a bit of a first-player advantage problem, although it is not overwhelming in a game with around 20~25 rounds.

Not a bad exploration/building/adventure game although there are better games in each of those catagories. It is however, an enjoyable game and works well with families and or 2 players. Good intro to more involved adventure games since the game has some light character development and exploration. Probably the most non-Catan like of all the Catan series games.

RATING: 5
Kind of what you'd expect to get if you had the mad idea of blending a dungeon crawl with Settlers;  solitaire-ish exploration and adventures mixed with the set collection element from Settlers.  The world of Candamir is quite well themed in a fairly generic Medieval European way.  The narrative element of the adventure cards, with recurring characters in them is really quite nice.  However, the game does ramble on rather too long, repeatedly taking you back to the same places.

RATING: 6.5
Candamir combines the mechanisms of Catan with just a hint of RPG-style character development. let's be honest that later aspect is very slight as there are only minor changes you can make to your characters. But each one does have useful special abilities and the exploration of the game is fun. This game is just okay since no additional content was ever put out for it. Which would have increased its replayability. But after a few plays you really have seen everything the game has to offer and it starts to feel samey.

man, this was a pretty big disappointment.  it leads off pretty cool, but that's as far as it goes.  and it goes, and goes, and goes.  whatever you liked about the game while learning the rules will be destroyed through repetition and a lack of engagement or tension.  maybe i'd play it again on a crazy day for far less vps.  but really, why would i bother?  the only really good thing that came out of this game was learning about profeasy for tutorials.

WHY A 2.5 RATING BASED ON BGG RATING DEFINITIONS? - Flat out, this is a boring game.  I will not be "convinced" to play this game again because it is too boring.  Maybe my daughter when she comes of gaming age could.  This game is not "extremely annoying" (2).  Therefore it receives a 2.5 rating.

RATING: 5
Played it today at Essen.

Feels like a mixture of Talisman and Settlers. You run around with your character, collect resources, fight bears and wolfes and gain experience. Your use resources to build stuff (1 wodd + 2 fur = 1 parchment) and gain points. Whoever reaches 10 points first wins.

There is almost no interaction with your oponents (apart from trading resources), which I found a bit boring. It's more of a roleplaying board game. If you like this sort of game you might wanna check it out, if you're expecting a new settlers type game, you will probably be disapointed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While an okay game, I don't see much replay value in this one after 3 or 4 times on the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Resource collection game with character progression a la Talisman. High luck factor especially with early rolls that have an exponential impact (good or bad )on the rest of the game.
Trading was minimal with our group but also the key to setting up the win.
Main problem is one of pacing, it seems to me that the game is not too long (as many other comments say) but rather inversly paced, early play clears out the low hanging fruit near the village and then just when the game should be ramping to a climax it slows down as the journey times shoot up.

RATING: 2
Players expecting a Settlers of Catan variant will be disappointed (or perhaps pleasantly surprised) to find that this is really a light RPG boardgame. Not nearly so chaotic as Talisman or as deadly as Heroquest-- but not so colorful nor as engaging as either, IMO-- players instead direct their character through a meager, yet plausible, existence as one of Candamir's villagers. Fun, but it feels as if you're competing against the game more than each other.

Not terribly intuitive on the first play.  You need to know too much about tile and card distribution--before playing--in order to do well.  Don't waste your time boosting charisma... it's more important to boost one of the other 3 abilities (which work on both challenge cards and obstacles like bears).  Based on 1game,4p,2hr

The game looks nice, is easy to teach. It is very playable. However, the problem of this game is the lack of user interaction. It's a race game: who develops the character abilities efficiently enough to attribute to the most construction in the village.

RATING: 3
Maybe an English version would help strengthen the theme and improve my enjoyment (the quest (?) cards are clearly where most of the theme is but the volume of german language meant we ignored that, as it was only for flavour).

Game is overly long for what it is - very very repetitive, with little interaction and it was 'ok' for the first 1/3 getting to around 6 vps, and then became tedious in the extreme ... 

Went in thinking I might like it, went away glad it was over!

This is a fun and light adventure style game.  The theme is good and also mildly amusing at times.  The game play is solid, with the only real criticism being that the game can take a little long for what it is, but then this is easily modified by altering the number of victory points needed for victory (say to 8 rather than 10).

All in all a fun experience.

RATING: 4
Candamir is not as good as Elasund.  Both involve placing your victory cubes in a town until someone places their last, but Elasund is cut-throat and intense, whereas Candamir is laid-back and a little limp.  The strategy aspects of the game work fine, and the movement system is actually pretty cool, but the attempt at Runebound style adventure gaming, while appreciated in theory, is executed pretty badly.  Firstly, the characters in this game are just lame as can be - bad illustrations, laughable names, and the color scheme just screams extended pinky finger tea sipping.  Secondly, the role-play elements are not particularly balanced, as it is not so hard to gain experience or weapons upgrades, so there are few real threats out there when traveling.  If the game played faster, like Elasund, this wouldn't be a problem, as it would be wrapping up as you were able to easily kick-ass, but this is not the case.  Needless to say, the game can drag on.  Not Teuber at his best.

Too long for what it is.  Interesting in the early going as you look around, but then you realize.. that's the whole game.. and it takes longer and longer to do as the game goes on.

RATING: 6
Update: I bought the English version and it is much improved.  The greater number of resources on the tiles shortens the game a bit.  It is still too long for such a random and light game, but now I would consider playing it.  Good with 2 players, OK with 3.  I still would not play it with more than 3.  
=======
Update: Raising my rating +1 because it is not bad as a two-player game -- the downtime is bearable but the game is still too long.
=======
Just doesn't work for me.  Feels like a watered-down combination of an adventure game and a building game.  As an adventure game it is simple and repetitive - too few options and surprises.  No competition for Runebound or the like.  It's a little better as a building game, but again other games are more interesting in this regard (e.g., Settlers of Catan).  All-in-all it just feels like drinking tepid water for two hours...not nauseating enough to immediately quit, but certainly not refreshing enough to want to experience it again.  It probably loses something for English-speakers because we haven't read the novel and did not use a translation for any of the stories on the adventure cards.

Tiles in the US version (the correct tiles; the 3s and 4s are richer than the German version, and early adopters may need to get replacements from Mayfair) make for a much better game. With the replacement tiles, I rather like this one, as it's unusual, moves along well, is more subtle than it appears, and has interesting choices ... i.e., all the vague stuff that makes a good game. A touch on the long side, maybe, and the endgame can be a little slow - like Settlers, there can be a time when two winning players are duking it out and the other players are fighting for 3rd, but unfortunately this can take more like 20-25min instead of 10 in classic Settlers. But still, a lot to like, up to the standards of Settlers and Starfarers and yet much more different, and definitely better than other Settlers stand-alones like Settlers of the Stone Age and Settlers: Nurnburg.

Settlers meets adventure gaming... A winner? Unfortunately far from it. Indeed, it fell flat with our entire gaming group. Is it just us? I don't think so. The game especially suffers from little player interaction, repetitiveness and being simply too long (for what it is).

About time Teuber really comes up with something other than Settler derivatives. That may all be very well commercially, but he seems to be no longer among the topnotch German boardgame designers.

RATING: 6
The game is not difficult to play but setup time and the amount of rules to review is a bit overwhelming for what is basically a set collection mechanic for winning victory points. 

The best initial strategy is to go in a beeline towards your destination and quickly gain experience by being vanquished repeatedly by beasts and adventures. Unlike other games, here when you fail you can still  continue moving if you still have endurance. Then skip a turn to quickly get back to an endurance of 4. Eventually you will gain enough experience to defeat the majority of encounters without losing much momentum.
 
Once you get the hang of this the game is simply a race to whoever accumulates 10 victory cubes on the board. With minimal player interaction there are much better games than this that provides more enjoyment and tension. The board is pretty though.

Fairly fun for what it is, which is multiplayer solitaire. I had heard about downtime issues, but I didn't feel there was above average downtime.

I think in some ways this is a better game than Anno and Elasund. Anno is kind of easy and a bit samey, while Elasund is overloaded and fiddly. Candamir seems to hit the right spot somewhere in the middle. The feeling of exploration and development keeps pushing the game forward. Sure, it's kind of long, but we're having fun the whole time. As a 2 player game, Candamir is one of the best in the series to date. The components are great, gameplay is focused and solid, and when you win, you know you earned it!

RATING: 7.5
This is actually a fun relatively quick adventure/exploration type game.  There are some decisions to be made, but crappy die rolls can be definitely set you back.  However, since we can finish a 2 player game in between 45 minutes and an hour, I usually just curse the dice and set the game up to play again.  If you enjoy adventure/exploration type games I would suggest giving this one a try.  My wife and I enjoy adventure games (Talisman, Runebound, Return of the Heroes, Arkham Horror, etc) but they have a tendency to be long so we usually can only play them on the weekends. Candamir is quick enough that we can get a game in almost anytime we are in the mood. If we want to play an adventure game and we aren't pressed for time, we'll play one of the aforementioned games, but this the best quick adventure/exploration game that I've run across.  I've only played this game as a 2-player game (9x), but I'm looking forward to trying it with more. I suspect that my rating will go up.  The short playing time is a huge bonus.

This one is really nothing like basic Settlers.  It is more an exploration game.  You are searching for tiles that provide resources.  While searching, you can discover more resources, run up against bears/snakes/etc...that you must kill that will net you resources, or go on quests...that will also net you resources if you are successful.  Once you have the resources, you can trade ala Settlers..then cash them in for VPs.  It's a nice attempt to mesh Talisman style game in with Settlers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Settlers of Catan "adventure" game.  Players play a lonely castaway trying to integrate themselves into the village.  To do this they must provide goods for the villagers, by exploring out in the wilds, having adventures, gaining experience and recoving goods.  Goods are "built" into stuff the villagers need (i.e. gain a VP), with a few longest road rules for leads on various tracks in the game.  The movement in the wild using a deck of directional cards is fun, but begins to feel a bit old quite quickly.  Still, this is a good Settlers game for two players, however it does drag with three or four.

Played over the weekend. Has a relatively straightforward mechanic. Fun to play, games do last 2-3 hours (maybe just cause first time playing?).  I went into the lead early, but was successively meaded to death, didn't place another victory cube.
good game, will bring out if asked.

Candamir is complex in the beginnig and after reading the rules the first idea was: No, I'll never play it right... 30 minutes later it was very easy to play. It's a game where you must 20-30% luck and the rest is thinking... I think, it's not easy for beginners, they have to be patient in the beginning...

Too long for 4 players. Probably great for 2. Ignore upgrading Charisma as it only effects adventures. Focus on prowess or strength as they will provide you wood and pelts. I think the mountain guy is the best as you can get wood from fighting/helping Candimir and pelts from bear and wolf then your bonus moves in the mountains will assist in getting stone.

Thematically a Catan game, but nothing like Settlers. If anything, this is a Catan role-playing boardgame where you travel around pre-Settlers Catan fulfilling quests and collecting resources.

After the initial shock that it wasn't very Settlers-like, I had to come to the conclusion that there are other games that do the "role-playing journey" thing better, namely Goldland.

Traded this away on a Math Trade, which was only fair, since I had gotten it in a Math Trade in the first place.

[4 plays] A jolly game of exploration in early Catan.  This is a nice thematic fit and definitely has a few similar mechanics to Settlers, but overall is quite a different game.  I like the unique movement mechanic and the way you can improve the strengths of your character.  This may be more complicated (and longer) with more people, but makes a fine 2-player game.

RATING: 2
Played 1 time. The brand from Catan; the pawn movement from Settlers of the Stone Age; the adventure cards from Starship Catan; the resource cards from Settlers of Catan; the slow and rather symmetrical development of "skills" from Settlers of the Stone Age; the "leader bonus" victory points from several of the games. In other words, a mishmash from all the otehr Catan games. And it left me feeling terribly uninterested in the game. I didn't hate it, but I couldn't find anything to like about it. The whole game feel tired and "used". The RPG element should have been a nice additiona but basically feel slow and symmetrical and barely differs from Settlers of the Stone Age.

RATING: 3
Was no fun at all. Maybe a must-have for Teuber-fans. Not for me. The game took more than two hours and I found it very exhausting to score. The destructive element of drinking "Met" (everyone else loses one life) is too annoying, because the less life score you have, the slower you move and sometimes there was nothing senseful to do at all.

Interesting variation on the Catan theme.  Takes a little while to understand the mechanism especially if you're used to traditional Catan "Roll,collect resources and buy".  Our group really enjoyed this one though I suspect it will take a while to develop strategies.  Trading element is virtually non-existent, even less so than in Settlers of the Stone Age! 
I like this with 2 or 3 players but it is too long with 4.

Update 28/12/2013 - Game now too simplistic for our evolved tastes!  This one will need to go.

Ok, there's a lot of chance in this game, but it was not bothering me at all. The lack of interaction was not bothering me either, as Candamir is a very social and thematic game (when not on turn you're helping your adverseries). A very entertaining game, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Ease of play and colourful bits make this a good one for the family, or kids. The card movement is an original, although once you've played it 10 times or so, it starts to get dull. If it were expanded, or if the game itself was a little more in-depth, it would be a little more interesting.

Addendum - if you're an adventure game fan with kids, this is an excellent and easy introduction game for youngsters. It's passable as an exploration game, and is a semi-worker placement as well. My kids enjoy it and it requires no reading.

Now that I have a couple of plays under my belt, I feel like I can comment on this game.  Originally I traded for this game to play with my children.  It may not be their thing, but the adults in the house enjoy it.  The standard Settlers trading is in play, although I haven't seen it get a lot of use.  However, there is more game here than might be apparent on the surface.  This game is all about balancing efficiency with opportunity.  As a result, on some level, it is more a racing game than just an exploration game.

This is the first game with pure Euro mechanics and a real sense of adventure, including a few RPG elements. The movement mechanic is very innovative and works really well. Excellent artwork, too.

Now if it only had miniatures and a fantasy theme...

I've played twice, and the game can really drag on a lot longer than I feel the reward for playing is.  Lots of downtime involved as the other players adventure forth into the great wide open.  As things become farther out, the game actually slows down, rather than speed up.

Still, I like the ideas in the game.  Maybe if people didn't take so long on a turn, this game would shine.

You can tell that a lot of work was put into development & the components are well-made.

JUL 09 Played once and while I think that there is a game in there somewhere, there was far too much downtime between turns - circa 7 minutes - in a 4 player game, and while I was playing with careful players, they aren't slow in playing (normally).

Not a bad game, but not enough player interaction for me. Sure, there's trading, but with the hand limit (5 resources and 5 ingredients) there wasn't as much wheeling and dealing as in other Catan games I've played. In the end it really felt like there were three of us playing three different games. I like a lot of the ideas in the game (movement, brewing potions, the different character stats, etc.) but the experience was ultimately uninspiring. I'd play it, but only if asked.

What a great addition to the Catan family! An adventure/action game where you struggle to build 1 SETTLEMENT and fight Bears, Wolves and Snakes along the way. Instead of collecting VP's you try to be the 1st to get rid of the 10 you start with and there are many different ways to do it.

RATING: 8
As a role playing boardgame this is probably my favorite.  I think why I like this one better than most other roleplaying boardgames is that Candamir weighs in more heavily on resource management elements than others of the genre.  I have to admit that the "adventure" elements of the game lack a little flair compared to dungeon crawl games.  In this game you are not slaying dragons and questing for powerful artifacts like Excalibur - but doing things like making window coverings and getting honey for a guy named Osmund.

When I got back into games the one I was most familiar with was Settlers, so I bought all the Settlers spin offs. This is one of the poorer ones.

Interesting mix of RPG and boardgame.  Doesn't feel like Settlers, but that's not a bad thing.  Pretty long playing time for what it is.  Huge setup time, too.  It's OK, but I like it less each time I play.  Not nearly the game Elasund is.

RATING: 7
More enjoyable than I was expecting - the exploration aspect is nice, though I suppose you can really get messed up by the luck of the card draw.  The die seems to play maybe even a bigger part of the game than in regular Settlers - I couldn't believe how many times players that only needed to roll a 2 to succeed in their adventure rolled a 1.  It's a nice race type game that feels like Anno 1503, but I would hesitate to play with 4 players again.  The game is fairly solitaire, with other players just taking the tiles or cards that you want.  There is too much downtime with 4.  I'd like to try this with 2 players to see how it goes - it seems pretty promising!

A nice idea completed with the feeling of an RPG or an old adventure game for PC. However, it lasts way too long for what you get and you can go through long periods where it feels like whatever you do, it doesn't matter at all. Luck may also be a too big factor in a game where possibilities to hinder your opponents are really scarce and weak, meaning: you get unlucky -> you fall behind -> you stay there.

I had hopes of liking this one.  Beautifully produced, authored by Teuber, part of his Catan series.  What's not to like?  I found no excitement in the box.  Treking to your destination you encounter mushrooms, bears, and locals.  You might have to search for the mushrooms, you might get et by the bear, or you might have to have some encouner with the locals.  But everything is mild.  I wanted more of a story arc out this experience.  Vieing to see who can provide the village the next set of window coverings does not an adventure game make, for me.

A fun 'fetch' game. I think it will get old fast though. I see this as being one of those games that gets lost in the back of the gaming cabinet and pulled out once a year to be played with zeal and then put back to be lost again. The game is completely run by the movement cards. It would be a lot more fun if it didn't take as long. I'd recommend making each player place 8 cubes rather than 10, therefore cutting the game time by at least 15 minutes.

Interesting game that combines some rpg elements with some light strategy.  Not sure how much re-play value there is though; probably better with more then 2 people.

Enjoyable and nice game, some elements similar to Catan but the mechanism is totally different. Might be a bit too long if played by four, but in case each players are experienced (say, they played the game at least two times before) the playtime can be reduced to one hour and even the "long time no play" part is significantly reduced so in this case this part is not so boring as it is depicted by some. Could be fun to add some more interaction (e.g. players fight) though.
It is also a well-balanced game; when we play by two, it usually ends as 8:10 or 9:10. It is also a game that got better with time.

RATING: 4
I surprised myself by enjoying this game.  I generally don't really enjoy any of the leveling up a character type fantasy based games but found I really liked this one.  However, one must be careful not to get too caught up developing your character's skills to the detriment of forgetting to turn in cards combinations to collect victory points.  There is very little direct player confrontation outside of drinking mead to force opponents who are doing better to slow down their movement.  Trading still is allowed.  Its just a fun experience game although I'm not certain if it will hold up to repeated plays.  Well, the second play already made me think I'm done.  It wasn't nearly as fun the second time around...:-(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So far, played only once a 2-player game. It was fun and a mixture between Anno  1503 and Runebound. The trading aspect was almost neglectible which, however, may be due to the fact that we were only 2 player. A major disadvantage is the lack of interaction between the player. Anyhow, it definitely manages to transport the Adventure theme pretty well. 
Another disadvantage is the long time. so playing fast and not thinking too long for the decisions to make is advisable and fits the theme as well. Other than that, I think the game will improve with more experience and maybe also with more player.

A szabályok elsőre bonyolultnak tűnnek, de az első játék végére minden letisztul. A játékban szinte semennyi interakció nincs (egyedül a mézsör, meg esetleg hogy amikor megjelölünk egy mezőt célpontnak, azt mások már nem fogják tudni). A kártyák játékosok közti cseréjét mi egyszer sem használtuk, egyedül a bankkal üzleteltünk (a magam részéről nem szeretem a csere mechanizmust: "Adok egy fát, ha adsz egy bőrt." "Oké, adok bőrt, de két fáért.", stb.)

A játék eléggé szerencsefüggő. Kellemetlen tud lenni, amikor az egyik játékos pont mindig eléri a célpont mezőjét a köre végére, a másik pedig sorozatosan lemarad róla, és egy újabb köre megy el rá. A lefordított "jutalmak" a mezőkön szintén a szerencse mértékét növelik, de ezt nem érzem kritikusnak, szerintem ez belefér.

A karakterfejlesztés alapvetően jól van megoldva, de problémás, hogy minél erősebb valaki, annál gyorsabban erősödik tovább (hisz annál könnyebben legyőzi a vadállatokat meg az egyéb próbatételeket, amikért jutalmat kap), ha meg valaki nagyon lemarad, egyre nehezebben fog tudni erősödni (mert már 2-es vagy 3-as szintű próbák jönnek, ő meg azokhoz még gyenge).

A pontozásra alapvetően szintén jó ötlet a falu lakóinak történő segítés, a tábla is szép, a próbatételek is ötletesek és változatosak (már ha a játékosok elolvassák, nem pedig csak a próba típusát és erejét, meg a jutalmat/veszteséget nézik), de lehetne többféle is, kicsit kevésnek érzem.

A játék tehát alapvetően nem tűnik rossznak, az egyetlen komoly hátránya a kevés interakció benne, de mégis rossz a játék. Ennek oka kicsit megfoghatatlan. Nem elég szórakoztató, azt hiszem angolul erre mondják azt, hogy nincs benne elég "fun". Jelenleg ez az 1423. legjobb játék, ami elég rossz helyezés, de reális. Nem egy rejtett gyöngyszem, ez van.

RATING: 7
Interesting Catan variant that feels more unlike the original than many of the others.  There is a kind of RPG-like aspect that reminds me of Runebound, Prophecy and the other games in which one tries to "level up" during play.  Grabbing low lying fruit and bonus points seems to be a key element to winning.  The encounters add a large degree of randomness but the game is pretty light anyway.  It might overstay its welcome somewhat.

Fun character building and resource planning game. Sort of a Return Of The Heroes Lite, without the actual combat.

 ....I'm reducing the ratings after playing again lately. The rules are too difficult to take off the shelf and just play on a whim - takes too long to read through and research. Yet another German Game With Wordy Rules That You Have To Read All The Way Through without any hope of looking things up to find out what you need to know. Blech!

First play last night. Lovely boards and bits. It lacks player interaction, but I enjoy that sometimes too. The exploring cards make an interesting new game mechanic. You flip cards to explore, and each direction could have a resource, nothing or an obstacle to overcome. Like so many Klaus Teuber games, you have lots of options and must decide carefully what you want to do.

[b]Played once, no desire to play again. Didn't even finish, since 3 out of 4 players had no interest in continuing (the 4th wouldn't have minded, but was ok with not finishing). Too random (movement cards, die rolls) and not enough interesting decisions for how long and complicated the game is. We played forever without getting close to 10 victory points. Using mead on other players slows the game down as well. Might be a bit less luck-determined once you are familiar with the symbol distribution on the tiles, but we won't find out.[/b]

RATING: 6
In the Catan series, but not as efficient as Catan. I actually like everything about the game design: from the role-playing feel, to the resource gathering, to the character powers, to the powering up your character in order to complete quests. But it just doesn't all add up to a strategic gaming experience. The one major drawback is game length. This in itself is not a problem if there are opportunities for strategic thinking and player interaction. Sadly, both are lacking. Using mead and trading are the only 2 ways to interact with other players and they don't even happen that often.  Competition for resources is no where near Catan level and angst is low.  I also wonder about replayability as there is not alot of variety of things to explore as compared to other adventure style games.  A valiant attempt, but this one misses gaming greatness.

So far I have played Candamir a couple of times with my two boys (7 and 5).  Amazingly enough, both boys understand the game mechanics and can perform all the necessary actions to complete their turns with minimal prompting and help on my part.

It's such a hit with the oldest, that this is the game he wants to play again on our next rainy day game session.

Probably got suckered into this due to the Catan brand. It's not a bad game but a little bit boring.

Like Catan you get cards which you can trade and use to build your settlement.

This is an RPG type version of Settlers where each player is a character that goes around the city of Candamir and has adventures while collecting resources.  You try to build up your character and collect resources.  Then you return to the village and sell what you have for victory points.

A decent adventure sort of game, but nothing special.  I think it's a bit random and goes on too long, sort of like Settlers of Catan.  I was lukewarm to the game at first, but felt that it filled a niche and the people who I played with seemed to enjoy it.  But I didn't enjoy my last play of this one much at all even though I won handily.  The other players enjoyed it less.  I think the movement mechanic is very neat, but it doesn't gel as a game.  Pretty much zero player interaction and very little tension.

Fun exploration style game.  Played with 2 - looking forward to playing with 4.  As usual with the recent Catan games, getting the bonus points is critical - so it will be interesting to see how competition for them ramps up.

---update---
Still haven't played with 4, but a few 3player games show that interaction does indeed increase.  There's more competition for majorities and more mead parties to slow everyone done as the game goes on.  Rating might get kicked up a notch depending on play with 4

--update--
So the tiles that came with the first printing of the game are incorrect and should feature more resources.  That should quicken the game.  Unfortuantely it still plays slow and the interaction still isn't there.  The fun the game provides isn't worth the time it takes to play it, so rating knocked down to 6

Fun game, plays well with two, adds a bit of a backstory to the Settlers series.  Ganeplay is in the vein of Runebound or Return of the Heroes (or really any game where players take the role of a hero, travel the land fighting beasts, gaining experience and completing quests).  But by comparison, it's much more streamlined.  Game mechanics are good, particularly the movement cards, which determine what item, encounter or adventure you might find on any given space.  It makes each journey out of the village an adventure, and lends the game a much better replay value than it might normally have if the spaces held pre-determined encounters.

RATING: N/A
A light-hearted game by the creator of Catan, Candamir sets players as Germanic huntsmen (and women), foragers, rangers, etc., in a low fantasy wilderness surrounding a village.  Tiles surrounding the village conceal useful resources like pelts, lumber, and ore, which players return to the village for processing into medieval finished goods.  These are then gifted to various villager NPC's to win item rewards and/or victory points (which presumably represent the gratitude of the village).  Random elements are controlled by d6-based skill checks, giving the game a light roleplaying element, and movement is handled neatly with an "encounter deck", where every step may bring unexpected rewards or place roadblocks in your path.  Not overlong on strategic depth, but plenty of fun for the whole family.  :)

RATING: 3
It's a light RPG game with beautiful bits and beautiful illustrations.  Rules seem quite complicated at first, but it's actually a very simple game.  During the first few rounds, we were all excited about this one.  Then after 45 minutes or so of the repetitveness and solitaire, we got bored and actually ended the game early.  The movement system is quite unique and the luck in the game (there is lots of dice rolling) isn't that bad actually, but we just didn't feel any real "progression" in the game.  It reminded me alot of Annos 1502, but I liked this much more, although I hate Annos.  Because of the length and solitaire factor, this game probably plays best with just two players, in fact you could probably play it by yourself and see how many rounds it takes for you to finish...then try to do it again in less rounds.  I thought there would be alot more trading in the game like in Settler's, but not really, we only traded when we had too many cards in our hand and didn't want to just throw them away.  If you're looking for a relatively lengthy family light-RPG, this could be perfect for you.  Although there's lots of German text, you didn't really need to understand it, a simple summary card in English would be just fine.

A little too much luck for my taste.  The game seems to mostly play itself and feels monotonous. Something is missing there; your choices are often obvious and winning doesn't give you that sense of accomplishment, since the next guy would have won if he was just slightly luckier than you in the final  couple of turns.

too much like Anno 1503 for my taste (also a 6).  Go explore, gather stuff and fight on the way, reach your goal, teleport to town, build stuff for VP, repeat.  Not bad, not exciting.  To be fair, if it were in English (or my group read German), the text on the event cards is entertaining (the first few times), but I don't really feel like I am competing with the other players.  There are interactions, trading, competing for spots to place VP and, my favorite, serving mead to give people ahead of you hangovers (as severe as losing a fight with a wolf or snake).   Not sure why it doesn't click for me, but it doesn't.

This game is like a mix of an RPG and a Euro, but not so deep and hence rather for families. On the other hand it is mainly multiplayer solitaire (much less trading compared to basic Catan), so it is okay with 2, starts to drag with 3, and is not acceptable with 4 (too much downtime).

Wow. This is stretching the Catan franchise a little. It has the basic shell (trading) but players are essentially moving along trying to race to 10vps. They do this by completing 'tasks' with trade cards as well as rolling dice to get the most control for missions.

I don't mind the luck but the game plays a little long for what it is...even with the updated tiles. If it can be finished in 1-1.5hours, then it would be a much better game. The lack of player interaction (other than using the mead as a 'take that!') is a pity.

As is, it strikes me as a rinse-repeat type game. Yawn.

It loses all the great player interaction of regular Settlers, but it is not nearly as unwieldy as Starfarers or C&K (which is good).  Luck dominates and it's a little repetitive.

RATING: 3
There are a number of good ideas in the game, but I was constantly asking myself, "Where's the twist?"  This rapidly devolves into a repetitious back and forth gathering goods on the way to get a token.  Really this is a contest of efficiency with some luck from the encounters tossed in to throw you for a loop.  I never felt any compelling danger or excitement, nor was there any tension as there is little competition(But for the "Longest Roads" part of the game) even then it made more sense to stay to yourself in order to maximize your points.  The game forces specialization so there rarely is a need to get in each other's faces.  

One of the biggest downers of this game is that there is nothing to do while waiting for other players, what simple choices you can make are made immediately after your turn or during your next turn.  Somehow this crammed the worst of the party game mentality into an "RPG" system.

It is as if someone wanted to make a childrens version of Runebound. As I was playing this I felt like much of this was done better significantly better by Fantasy Flight's adult counterpart (which already has its own problems).  

It was mentioned in my last play of Candamir (by a fellow geek that I totally agree with) that this was like taking a poop.  There is something kind of enjoyable about it, but really there isn't anything to be be overly excited about, it works and by the end you have something to show for it...  I feel that this is a  good analogy, but it misses a very key factor, unlike taking a poop, I never have to play this again.

I do have to say that it was entertaining to call out "Now you must fight the bear!"

1 play, 4er (3 newbies). Horrible! Took a long time, with a lot of sitting around waiting for my turn to come again. To be fair, I made some bad choices (ignored the upgrades of the person to my right) and some bad rolls. But I never seemed to be able to get the movement cards I wanted, either! Anyway, I'd like to try it one more time, playing faster.

Its not a bad little game, it has a pretty original movement mechanic and I like that you are able to level up your character to your own specifications. That being said it plays out almost like a card memory game. Not a WHOLE lot of strategy here, but enough to make it enjoyable for a little while. Great game for the under 15 crowd, but for the serious gamer, there simply is not enough depth to warrant continued play

Another good Settlers spinoff.  I played with four and the game took a while, I would guess too long for many.  The movement cards and their decisions and potential conflicts are the most intriguing aspect.  The downtime during your opponent's turns is more enjoyable than most games just to see what happens.  I definitely want to play again and I can see my rating fluctuating in either direction.  Update:  played again with four and liked it even more.  It does take a little while and I suspect it's best with two or three.

I'll start with the disclaimer. In general, I don't really like RPG boardgames (Runebound, Descent, etc.), so this game started off with a few points knocked off.

There are some interesting elements to the game, but the luck factor is just huge--choosing your goal tile, the travel deck, the dice, etc. In the end your moves are terribly obvious and sitting around watching your opponents flip the travel deck gets dull real fast.

Settlers prequel.  Has resources to collect, trade and spend but unlike Settlers, there's really little incentive to trade them.  Really it's a simplified role-playing game.  Players assume the role of characters and explore the countryside for items and resources.  Little player interaction.  Rather weak for a Settlers game but still kind of fun.  Torn between rating it a 6 or a 7 but decided that for me, this is closer to a 6.  Your mileage may vary.

RATING: 7
Quite enjoyed my first play. Unlike other Settlers spinoffs, there's next to nothing here that reminds me of the original game. I liked the expolration aspects, and the cardplay involved, plus the idea of developing your abilities to increase your chances in specific adventures. I also liked the fluctating demand in the village. There's a fair bit of randomness involved (which countryside tiles you aim for, the outcome of trials/adventures), but its the same sort of level as in Settlers. Out game involved zero trading between players, and lasted about 2 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's been interesting to see the development of Klaus Teuber's ideas with each new Settlers game.  The trading seems to be less important in this game than in previous games--we played about a third of our first game with no trading between players at all. I was also amused to see that the exploration tiles are hexagonal even though they don't really need to be--keeping that tenuous link with the original game alive.  A worthy addition to the Settlers series.  I really like this game.

RATING: 9
I really enjoy this.  Very different, lots of different things to do in the game.  Resource, gathering, character advancement and quests!
Movement systems is unusual: draw a card, which shows obstacles or things to find in each direction. Do you want to get to your destination faster, or pick a safer or more rewarding route?
The main interaction is in fighting for majorities, and it can be very fierce and lead to tough choices; do you want an upgrade early that will overall improve your chances, or should you instead go for grabbing a majority?
I suspect many players will not like it due to low player interaction, high luck.  Oh well, their loss.

RATING: 3.5
I don't know what to say about Candamir.  Is it fun?  Yes, I think it is.  It usually is.  Can it be frustrating?  Yes, it can be.  Does it often feel like it's obvious what you should be doing?  Yes, yes it does.  And more than any other Settlers-inspired game, it feels like one is playing, well, alone.  You could be playing a 2-, 3-, or 4-player game, and yet what any individual player does doesn't change much.  The primary method of interaction (besides trading, which happens rarely if at all) is using Mead to slow down the other players.  Is that really all the interaction I want in a game?  No, I want more.  There's no blocking via roads, or "Take that!" via the robber.  Hell, Ticket to Ride has more interaction.  But when I'm up for something vaguely RPGish with nice bits that doesn't take a lot of mental energy, Candamir fits nicely.

Revised September 2009 from 6.5 to 5.5 - I just haven't felt a push to play this in a long time.  There are so many better games out there, that even though this one can be enjoyable, I get a feeling of "Sure, but..."

Revised January 2010 from a 5.5 to a 4.5 - I can't count how many times in the past 4-5 months, after I revised it in September 2009, that I've said "OK I'll bring out Candamir next time and teach people!"  And then I don't.  I simply don't feel like playing it.

Revised July 2012 from a 4.5 to 3.5.  I can't justify giving it a 3 using the BGG definitions but while it's a pretty game, neat components, good theme, and I want to get it on the table, I just don't see it happening.

This was my favourite game when I'd played <10 euros.  I still enjoy it.  I like the idea of development of a character; I'm a big roleplayer/RPGer, so I like that concept.  It somehow makes it more personal too, because you feel that you're playing a character, not just using your brain to win.  Wandering around the countryside finding things can be fun, but remembering where cards can be challenging - a bit too much like 'memory' there.. (which I'm not good at) :P

Not a bad game by any means, just slightly boring. There is a lot to like(movement mechanic, RPG-like statistics), but the game takes a bit too long for what is has to offer. In the end, the lack of options makes it a bit too repetitive and the original movement mechanic can cause considerable downtime. Moreover, I feel like the game offers you little control (dice and card drawing add up to quite a high luck factor). I would have liked it better if it took less time with three or four players. And if it had better artwork and components (the pawns are especially ugly).

Finally, a Settlers game that doesn't feel like a Settlers clone!  Aside from the trading and the building, the mechanics are very different, and makes the game feel like a new experience.  There's still a lot left up to the luck of the die, but there are several ways the game lightens that load for you.

My wife really likes this game, but I'm so-so on it.  I think it needs some tweaks to snazz it up or something.  The pacing is not to my liking -- it takes a long build-up to get the first couple of VPs and get your character improved and then things take off.

Played this one a long time ago. It's not bad, but I expect to play this one never again. It takes to long for little content.

Slightly more fun than Settlers of Catan because there's an exploration aspect to it.  But the theme breaks down because the player starts in the same place after finishing exploration, and it drags on longer than it should being a close scoring game throughout the whole time.

My first experience was a ghastly slow game with three players, and since then I've played only with two. Perhaps with four experienced (and speedy) players I could tolerate the game, but I don't think I'll be in that situation anytime soon.

I prefer playing with a variant I inadvertently created by misreading the rules, namely that you can claim a tile by placing your marker on it, but you can land on another tile and claim that one instead, teleporting back to camp like normal. This speeds the game somewhat since the movement cards might take you in a different direction, yet you can still claim a tile then head towards the marked tile next time.

Strange prequel to settlers of catan (includeing a strange meeple) fun but takes quiet a while, there is resource aquisistion reminiscent of but not as arbitrary as settlers, also resources used to build things, the scope is alot tighter than settlers as each player represents a single individual as opposed a tribe, adventuers must be completed and items found to aid your quest to become a member of the village, fun but 60 minutes seems unlikely as a play time we took 2 hours for a 4 player game. With continued repeat playings there may be the possibilty of all games becomeing the same, but nevertheless enjoyable and worth a look as an entry level game. I especially like the movement card mechanic

Settlers ala RPG.  A good addition to the line but less interaction between players.

More decisions to make than in Settlers but somehow these decisioned seemed to be more restrcted.  I know this does not make sense!  I like the game and want to play again, may re-rate.

There's not much of a game here.  Very few real decisions, and none of them particularly interesting.  Even my 8 year old got bored after a couple of plays.

A pretty simple rpg type of game.  Doesn't take too long, and has the resource gathering elements of Setters in it.  I like the movement/encounter system using cards and having choices on what to do.

I was thrilled the first time I played this game!
It's so cute and cosy ^_^ 
I just wanna play it over and over again :laugh:
Unfortunately it tends to be kind of dull after playing it several times, because it's such a small and simple game - that's why I would like to see some fresh expansions to this game. That would be so awesome :p

played a demo @ origins '05 with Jimzik and the lovely Miss Panda and Xandryte. Didn't get to finish the game but I   liked what I played so far. Interesting twist to the series.

I forget what we did but it was wrong. It did shorten the game which was a plus. Need to try again.

Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). The game was promising, with interesting ideas, but I found it much too long and repetitive to be worth it. It seems that the Mayfair tiles make it a bit shorter, so I might give them a try some day if I have a chance (I have only played, and own, the Kosmos version).

A good game but not my favourite of the Catan range, there seems to be very little control over what happens.

A good intro-level "RPG" style game. The theme (and quite a bit of the artwork) can be laughable, but the mechanics work well enough. As I taught my 5-year old how to play, I couldn't help but see this as a nice stepping stone to more involved adventure games like Runebound, which made me glad to have it in my collection.

Bought it years ago, but unfortunately just around that time I lost interest in Catan. I still want to try it, but there always seems to be something I want to play more.

I thought I would like this more than I do. I think the game play is ok... my wife likes it a lot. But I cant seem to get past making drapes - seems so stupid. All the hard work collecting resources...to... build... drapes... yuk. I don't know - it is missing something. But I will play if someone (**wife**) asks.

I think Candamir's failure is in trying to accomplish too much. The game is easy to get into and seems to offer a lot of potential, but quickly becomes repetitive and drags on at the end, as players need to move farther and farther, taking longer and longer, to accomplish their goals. The mead item further drags the game down by pulling leaders back instead of empowering trailers. That said, I do like the adventure concept, as characters develop, earn experience, provide for the needs of the villagers, explore and do other adventure-y things. It's just too darn long. I think I'd play it once or twice with my nephew, but can't see ever playing this again with more sophisticated gamers.

The card movement is an interesting mechanic, and I enjoy the differing characters' abilities.  However, Candamir suffers from a relative lack of trading...or any other player interaction.  

Note: Interaction improves significantly with four players but is still a bit lacking.

이제 수험생활에 들어가서 보드게임 같은 도락과는 거리를 두려고 했는데, 그럼에도 불고하고 구매한 게임.. 원래 공포의 함대 해외구매할 때, 같이 사려다가 만 녀석인데 결국 이렇게 구하게 되었다. 암만 생각해도 보드게임은 구할 수 있으면 국내에서 구하는게 훨씬 싸다. 이 게임도 Coolstuffinc.의 가격이 44불인데, 국내에서는 더 싸고 배송비도 천양지차지. 아무튼 사고 나니, 긱에서의 안좋은 평들이 눈에 거슬리지만 그래도 단순하다는 점에서 가족용 게임으로 즐길 수는 있지 않을까 싶다.

Really an easy and funny game. You are one of the first settlers and your quest is to build many parts of the village. Go around for exporing the land and find some herbs. The most brave and fast will become the Hero of Catan

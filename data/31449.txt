Very simple abstract tile placement with lovely thick frog-shaped tiles. Not much to it, but it plays quickly and is delightfully tactile. Traded for Funny Friends - abstracts really never hit the table for me.

Everything is there for a great game... except the fun part. The bits are awesome (as can be expected from Gen42), and the rules are short and well-written. But the game itself... I don't know. I played on-line and didn't enjoy myself. I'll give it another chance... but I doubt my rating will change that much. "Hive" this ain't.
(Note: rating based on 2-player games. Maybe it'd change with more.)

As is sometimes the problem with multi-player abstracts you can play for half an hour, build up a good position, then player 2 makes a mistake and player 3 wins. Not very satisfying. Didn't really grab me so traded away.

Fun abstract. Lovely, heavy and chunky pieces. Perfect for playing in the garden.

RATING: 4
Rules to the game don't seem natural to the theme, in other words, they appear forced. 

For instance, one rule is you can't have three frogs in a row of one color (in three connection). Why? What does that have to do with frogs?

All the ideas in hive appear to match the theme nicely, but here they just seem contrived. The "frog" theme seems pasted on, much more so than hive.

Interesting game, with lovely very tactile pieces. Unfortunately it's taken only a handful of times before most tactics resolved out of the chaos of the potential of the game, and for games to devolve into a long slog of obvious moves. Nice to play sometimes, still, but the comparison with checkers is more apt than I'd hoped for.

RATING: 4
Tidy filler with great chunky pieces very suitable for the pub.

Subsequent plays makes me think the flow of the game favours the players whos frog colour comes out first. It stands to reason that if one colour has 7-8 out and another has 5 then the most popular colour has the earliest chance to win and therefore more chance. Further thought and the luck of the draw in the tiles contributes a slice of luck that is too great for my tastes.

Rating lowered (twice) and game moved to trade list,

A 7 for now until I get more plays of this in. It seems like a fun little thinker that takes the fun of hive to 3-4 players. Good, portable, indestructable game. I don't know if it is as good as Hive, but time will tell.

Multi-player Hive would be a simple way to describe this. As a two player game, Army of Frogs is lackluster. Play with 4 and it can be a very satisfying brain burner. Does it hold a candle to Hive? No. But if you liked Hive, you should own this as well.

An excellent little abstract game.  Plenty of fun, and light enough to be learned quickly and easily.  This game is better with 3 or 4 players, but is a wonderful little game - John Yianni has made another great, simple little gem.

There are a couple of rules we have got wrong - 1) you can only move your own piece. 2) when you place a piece of your own it cannot be placed in contact with any of your other pieces.

These two rules make all the difference, really making the game shine.  A tense little abstract that is neat, light, quick and fun.  A good amount of thought is involved too!

Bounding stegosauric frogs.  A fair combinatoric game (modulo the random draws) with two players.  Not exactly fork-heavy; the decision points come in suggesting and setting up potential forks.  With more players the game dilutes somewhat, but remains fair with 3.

Update: severe deadlock problems with 3, over-large luck-of-the-draw.

RATING: 5
I live Hive a fair bit, although its not my favorite genre (2p abstracts). Army of Frogs takes a lot from Hive and then adds in a chaotic element (the 2 frog "hand" from the draw bag). The problem is that the player whose frogs are drawn first has an advantage. 

If there is a symmetric appearance of the frogs, then the game works...and there is room for some cagey play in deciding which frogs to put into play and how disadvantageously to place them. But if there is an assymetric appearance (one player's frogs don't come out), then that player is not going to have any chance whatsoever. 

For an abstract game of this nature, invoking that much luck seems a little off. The upside is that it keeps the game moving quickly. Hive games can tend to drag, and Army of Frogs doesn't suffer there at all.

Maybe it was how our group played, but this became quite dull to me as we all played very defensively, ensuring that no one could win in the coming round. This just meant it went on until either a) someone made a mistake letting another player win or b) someone was forced to be kingmaker (let another player win because both opponents couldn't be stopped).
Meh...

As a multi-player version of Hive, it works as best as it can, but it just doesn't have the depth. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In short: a multi-player (and a little simplified) version of Hive, with some added randomness. Despite that, the game seems very interesting, if not as brainburning as Hive.  I don't really mind the randomness as the game is really short and the random opening usually isn't game deciding, the only real concern here is a large possibility of a stalemate, since one can very easily block the other player by pining down one of their pieces with the one island rule.  While it does not happen all the time, it is a very annoying occurrence when it does.

Not quite as good as Hive - but the pieces retain the chunky, funky and clunkiness.

RATING: 3
A simpler hive-like game for children. There are no special powers, and the goal is to jump the frogs until they are all touching one another. Untimately the outcome is dependent upon how many frogs of your color you can randomly pull from the bag. Hopefully you get enough of your frogs to win... but not so many as to delay the unification of your pieces.

Like it's cousin, Hive, this game's indestructability allows this to be played where most games wouldn't dare go. It's not as deep as Hive, but it gains points for it's ability to handle up to 4 players.

Close to being broken.

A serious part of the game revolves around blocking other players from winning or at least avoiding to help them to win.  You analyze how not to help somebody instead of analyzing what you can do to win by yourself.  Terrible feature...

Reeeally long for such a simple and - let's say - family game.  Tedious.  Looking for legal moves alone is tiresome.  Towards the end the game seems not to finish in the imaginable future -> find a legal move that - above all - doesn't help anybody to win immediately (and possibly helps you to win).  The game can drag into a true deadlock near the end - hence 'close to broken'...

Very nice multi-player abstract game. Hexagonal frog tiles make up the board (starting from scratch). Each turn, players must move one of their own frogs and then add one of the two frogs in their hand to the board. Objective is to get all your own frogs together in a single group.

This one is much lighter than Hive.  I didn't know how a total abstract would go over with my kids but they immediately wanted to play again.  It is kind of like Uptown and Zenix in that you want all of your pieces to be together.  The pieces are great and the movement is easy to explain.  Yes, it probably has a king maker problem.  And I don't love randomness in my abstracts.  Still it's a good "pub" or meetup game.

Hive lite.  Ok with 2 (rating 6) and great fun with 3 or 4 (rating 8).

I like it more than I expected after reading so much negativity here. The luck of draw doesn't seem to be an issue: unless everyone pulls only the one color from the bag, quite soon all the 10 tiles of each player are out from the bag and then you can start the second phase of the game. The third phase may have deadlock problems: this third phase is when each player has their tiles in one group but one or two and it seems the first bad move will cause a player win. Actually this made our last game last 80 minutes instead of 35 but there was a clear winner in the end.
As in multiplayer abstracts, of course there is the problem of players with different skills but I don't find that to be a problem of the design.

Played few times, 2p, 3p.  Better than I expected, but I don't think 2 is the right number.  I preferred the game with the 3rd color as a blocking color.  I think this is a good game for people who want to play Hive with multiple players.

Love the beautiful bakelite components and cute frogs.  I think I would want more advanced design/rules.  As rules are written, I suspect it might have a limited number of plays before it becomes stale.  I think player screens would help as would a few more rules wrinkles added for fun factor to those who have played several times.

A disappointment considering its heritage in the family of Hive.  I have only played this against a single bot on Board Space though so my rating is provisional until I play it face to face with more than one opponent.

I dunno, after playing Hive it's obvious that it was intended to make a multiplayer version that was simple and fast to play, but it just seems like there's no way to truely strategize. After my first plays I found that someone is always giving the win away unless they get lucky. 

It needs a few more plays as I see glimmers of truth peeking out; I also love bakelite.

I'll have to give this another go, but it was quite disappointing after Hive. It seemed like a very simple place-and-move game that didn't have a lot of strategy to it. Draw from the bag, move a tile. Great little rules set, shame about the game itself. Yanni keeps up his excellent production values with very nice bakelite pieces. This is something for other games companies to aspire to. It's just disappointing that the same effort wasn't expended on the playability.

Played 2 3-player games of a prototype version of this.Abstract game, but thanks to the nice froggy playparts and froglike movement it certainly has more "theme" than the average abstract.

My immensely-complex-game-fan friend and simple-often-random-game-loving me meet in the middle over abstracts.  We both liked Hive, so I picked this one up.

Hive is probably the better game, but this melts my brain a little less.  And I haven't been trapped as often, unable to move as the other player jumps around the board.  Plus, you can have more players!  Useful.

Seems to play better with more than 2 players.
Works nicely, but in my (limited) experience, it always concludes in the same way: each player moving simply to prevent the next one winning on their turn, until someone fails at this.
Lovely components of course.

RATING: 7
With only one species of piece, simpler rules, and a pretty neat winning condition, I expected to like this better than Hive, and I did. It has a little similarity, in the ability to "pin" an opponent's piece, but it seems that one can plan ahead better here. There is some luck involved in the tile draw, but everybody has the same number of their pieces in the bag, so the randomness isn't as big of a problem as it might seem at first. I've only tried it so far with two, but it could be one of those rare abstracts that works with more than two.

If this was online, I'd be playing it a ton.

An interesting game.  I encountered a "move-countermove" lockup problem with 3 players, but I think playing with 4 would correct it.  Overall, it's a fun game, even with 3 players.  My advice would be to not allow open discussion of potential moves to help encourage "non-optimal" moves.  It seems that with 3 players, each moving optimally, a stalemate is eventually created.  I could be wrong about this, but it did occur in my very first playing.

If you like Hive, you'll probably like this.

A simplified Hive, where all the pieces are grasshoppers (but which can now do multiple hops in a turn) and the aim is to get all your pieces together. Like Hive, the main denial tactic is the anchor - you can't move your piece because it would split the group into two - so your turns centre on anchor creation and anchor escape. With only 1 movement type to consider, and one main tactic, the game can be treated fairly lightly, especially when played multi-player where each player has to be conscious of potential moves by each other player and whether it's their responsibility to stop them. In a two player game, it can get fairly deep and bogged down stalematey though, with lots of blocking moves. It's easy to teach which is a plus. It may be playable with older kids, but the play is very abstract so the appeal won't be there. It sort of falls into a nether world, being neither ideal for gamers (too 1 dimensional) nor family (too abstract).

12/18/11 - Evil, Evil, Evil. Army of Frogs is just pure evil as you manipulate your frog pieces to connect them. You move one of your frogs and place a frog from the game. The rules are simple but the actual game play can be frustrating. This game causes you to think and think some more. If I put this here can he hop and add it to his grouping or if I move this piece will that help the other players. Did I mention this game is evil?

I rate it a 6 at this time. It's a nice filler with some brain burning moments.

Crash and burn. Didn't enjoy at all. 

3 player-we got in a stalemate position at the end-would have taken a lot of movement and jockeying for one of us to win.

Rated after one play.  Went fast and the pieces are just fun to play with.  There's a good hint of strategy.  There's a problem, though - like any other game where there is an object of "do X and you immediately win," if a player is close to X, other players will do all they can to prevent that win.  It works in some games but I think in this game you could have an interminable sequence of "prevent the win" moves leading to a game that never ends.

Not as brilliant as Hive, but still intriguing.  Played with 4, but that felt a little too random and chaotic (and too much reliance of group sacrifice).  3 is probably the sweet spot.  However, it's an effective 3+ player abstract.

Quirky and fun, as is Hive from the same designer. In a way, it's Hive for up to four players (even though the rules really are different, there is a similar feel). One possible downside is that I think the game is won by the player who follows the player who makes the first real mistake.

RATING: 6
Has the multiplayer abstract problem, where things are really dependent on the person who plays before you. This also seems to lead to kingmaker scenarios since, frequently at the end of the game, two players are one move away from winning. Another player can often only block one person from winning.

Good solid game.

It's a light, very light game with nice components.  Good for an occasional diversion and a quick play.  Luck of the draw from the bag (especially towards the end) interferes with an otherwise nice game.  Advantage is multi-player abstract game.  For 2P games, more likely to pick something in the GIPF line.

RATING: 7
Clever, and nice pieces.  Army of Frogs is to Hive as Tantrix is to Trax, maybe.  Simple rules make it nice for newbies and nongamers and kids too.  Need to play more to see how much lasting power it will have over me.

Possible problem with endgame dragging in a deadlock of sorts sometimes, which gets broken only if someone makes a silly brainfart mistake and lets someone win.

Also the opening part with random drawing and placing is usually inconclusive and feels a bit ritualistic to get to the second part when all frogs are out and it becomes pure strategy with no chance.

--Oct2008--  It's physically very appealing - and fits in the "can play while camping or at the beach" niche very well.  Game play is not too bad - at least with more than 2 players.  It's very nice with 4; pretty good with 3, and rather uninteresting with 2.  There's still a bit of concern that one wins as a result of the error of others (rather than one's own good play) but I'd need several more games before giving up.

Rated as it would apply to younger children.  Pretty much like hive without all the different abilities...  I found the simplicity of this one reduces it's appeal to me personally...  yet makes it a better game to introduce to school age children.  However...  since the game is more streamlined, an experienced player will have an easier time beating a new player as the moves are more limited and successful placement is more apparent to the experienced!

Simple, concise, perfect game for the boat this summer!  My rating is more based upon the fact that I am rating it for the purpose for which I purchased it (i.e. for use on my boat or on vacation at the pool or beach).  To that end it performs exceptionally well as it requires a small footprint, is made of hard plastic(wind and water proof), and is easy to carry in a small bag.  The game is simple to learn and teach and offers decent strategy.  My rating as simply a board game would probably be slightly lower maybe 6.5 - 7...

It feels like a dumbed down version of Hive. It plays like a dumbed down multiplayer version of Hive. It's not much fun because there's not much you can really do on your turn.

There's two reasons why I don't find this fun.

1. It's too simple. 

2. You're constantly relying on the other players not seeing the clever move you can see. If they see it you're foiled. If they don't then they probably did, but have their own problems to worry about.

(With four players, by the time you've set up a clever move it probably won't be possible the next time your turn comes around.)

Hive, it is not, and at 2 players the game feels slightly unbalanced with the luck of the draw effecting it too much. But, at 3-4 player counts the strategic edge rises quite steeply.

After a couple of plays, I really quite like this one. Wifey unfortunately doesn't (a bit too chess like for her liking). So I'll have to mark it down a couple of points for that.

I really like the tactile feel of the frogs and found the rulebook easy to navigate as well.

Maybe better with more than 2 players though?? May change rating after a few 3-4 player games.

UPDATE:

Have played a couple of 3 player games, and still not going down well with other players, so maybe not as good as I first thought...

Oh Army of Frogs, we've only known each other a short time, but our relationship has been so turbulent!  Are you finally a good abstract game for 3 or 4 players or are you a broken abstract game with a horrible stalemate and kingmaker problem?  Maybe it is just the people we hung out with together, maybe we should give it another shot?  Either way, I like you for what you are, a game with a lot of frogs,and their criticisms will never take that away.  Have a great summer and maybe we'll spend some more time together next year!

Have played a couple of games - can't do this one.  But why is it's average score so low.  It is a very good follow up game from the creators of Hive.  It has the same tactile pieces and is very different from Hive.

The randon nature of refreshing your hand can have dire consequences to the game, I have won one game (of only two wins) because of the first Eight tiles from the bag, 7 of them were my colour.  Don't let this put you off it is a good game, and the occassional fluke can be put up with.

Would it be wrong to get a game just because the pieces look and clack nicely?  Yeah...  I think it would be.  Not a bad game, but it's just falls a hair short.

Love, love, love this game. Have enjoyed it 2, 3 and 4 player. Simpler than Hive but most importantly more accessible for non-gamers. Plus the pieces are absolutely fab!

Gave this to my nephew, it's like Hive-Lite, but still more strategic than you'd think from looking at the box.

I got this to keep my Hive company.  Not bad as a 4-player game.  This one makes for another great travel game that's a quick filler.

One 2-player game at Essen 2008. Maybe it is better with more players.

Reminds me of cloister type games but at least the pieces are nice.

Pretty game, gameplay turned out to be ... meh. I was expecting much more of this.

A light tile laying game that is good for camping or when kids are around, as the plastic frogs are easily cleaned. Not interesting as Hive, but handy when you have 3 or 4 players.

Many multi-player abstracts disappoint.  This one doesn't.  Decent game.

Love the frogs. Still determining the depth of the game. I have been having trouble with this game. It seems hard to block your opponent but maybe I need more practice.

Played once with 2 players and once with 4. Rating provisional; want to try it again to get a better feel for it.

Seems fun, with simple rules but potentially complex jockeying for position.

A little too complicated for small children but not interesting enough for adults.

I enjoyed this more than I expected to.  The mandatory hopping about grants opportunity for some simple lateral thinking.  On the other hand, this is definitely a kingmaker abstract, in which an oversight by the person to your right gives you the game if the other people left it to him to stop you.

This was kind of a flop with me.  The decisions aren't very interesting or varied.

I will say that the pieces are very nice.

Edit: Tried it three player and found it to be more interesting.

After 2+ Plays: Wasn't impressed with the 2-player game, but it might me better with 3 or 4.  With two it seemed to be heavily dependent of which color you drew.

Is to Hive what Checkers is to Chess. Don't knock it!

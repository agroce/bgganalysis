RATING: N/A
Got this as a Christmas present this year. From the gorgeous box to the beautiful lookingmap this is an absoluely super production. Rules look the most complicated I've ever read (includes Europa and OCS). Quite obviously a labour of love for Mr.Vohlers but seems to be an awful lot going on - maybe too much. This will be played solitaire only I would imagine and will need an enormous commitment of time and willpower. Could rate a 4 or a 10 by the time I've finished playing!

If there was a category super heavy I'd put this in there.

Just purchased 1/08. Looks very good! Have read Norman Stones book on the eastern front as well as Solzhenitsyns 1914 and Red Wheel which give a good feel for the era, albeit a depressing one. Supposedly over 48,000 results possible from a combat roll...the designers grandmother was also made to spend time researching obscure Austrian archives. Excellent!

RATING: 8
A pleasant surprise to me; I was half expecting a monster of unwieldy complexity, but in fact it's very manageable (much more so than the rulebook led me to believe). There's an awful lot in here, but this is one of those games where the rules and play aids complement each other well. There's an ample example of play in there, and a comprehensive sequence of play ensures that you won't miss anything.

The maps are absolutely beautiful as well, some of the best I've seen. The counters fail to live up to that aesthetic quality, but they have a lot of information on them, and I'd rather they presented it clearly than emphasise prettiness over function.

My only complaints are that the footprint is huge, particularly with the off-map records, and that it doesn't go into the fascinating period of fighting in late 1914 and early 1915. Still, I have no regrets over the investment.

Granted, I just bought a new copy,so my review isn't definitive. However: the games rules provide a great deal of realism, while the counters are a little bland, the map art is excellent and printed on sturdy paper. 
About the only downside is the two hours of counter punching you're going to do when you decide to first play it, and about another hour of setup. So maybe punch one nite, play the next. 
If I really get into it, I just may purchase the rest of Michael Resch's 1914 series. GMT seems to focus on grognards like myself, and 1914 Twilight is the perfect example of a game we tend to go for.

Arrived from GMT (December 2007).  Well, it's got Austro-Hungarians in it and I already have Home Before the Leaves Fall (CoA) and The Cossacks are Coming (PWG and BroGames versions).  So that should cover both major fronts in the "mobile" phase of WWI.  Re-reading historical notes from SPI's GWitE to get in the "mood".

RATING: 9
Excellent: Operational - WW I - Heavy

Plus:
-Great theme
-Innovative system; VP rules are brilliant as are Strategic objective rules.
-Beautiful maps, good overall production level
-Good rulebook 
-Good scenario's
-Great supply point system where every 3 turns you get points to resupply units that suffered losses
-Unique VP system where you get VP points just for attacking, regardless of the result
-Unique objectives system
-Unsurpassed research
-Very evocative
-The ultimate WW I simulation on this scale

Minus:
-Combat; with a system where you get VP's for attacking you can expect quite a few battles. The necessity for a complex combat system is imo not justified; if there would only be a few decisive battles, then a combat system such as 1914 would make more sense.
Here I feel it stalls the speed of play to an extend it actually has a negative impact on the game and a simplified yet comprehensive combat system (say OCS) would have done more justice to the flow of the game without losing credibility.   
-Counters are nice but clearity could be better.
-Despite the tiltle, unfortunately no scenario's on the late 1914 / early 1915 period.

Very difficult to rate this big baby. The research and production value is great, so are the rules and some innovative concepts (VP's / Strategic Objectives) but the combat system is the main point of discussion: either you love it or hate it.

The individual scenario's are manageble (Tannenberg has a total of about 65 counters only) If you want to get as close as the real event as possible this is for you.

Similar in complexity as OCS (both appr. 50 pages of rules) and a strong focus on supply but here the comparisson stops.
 
Please note a sister game for the West Front is under development.

For WWI buffs only.

RATING: 7
Great maps, good counter design.  Battle resolution is too cumbersome, and rigidity of objectives embedded in the rules reduces player options severely. A variant that frees one or both sides from these limitations, and allows for variable/enhanced German deployment based on one of their other Aufmarsch plans, would be fascinating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
   If the game only lasts until December 1914, I'm not sure as to the whole point of it.  Neither Russia nor Germany were fully mobilized in that part of the world, and thus neither had the ability to pursue the war to a conclusion at that point.  So I tend to see Tannenburg, Galicia and the lake battles, bloody as they were, more as preliminary skirmishing than the real Eastern Front war - which I see as getting underway at Lodz a month later.      It would be like having a Civil War strategic game that ends in Dec. 1861.

I really like this game:  it handles some of the familiar kinds of systems we are used to from hex and counter games (combat via odds ratios; supply; and movement rules in particular) in very innovative ways.  I think that it dramatically improves on much of what has gone before in those areas.

For example, in combat, the relative strengths of the two sides can and do matter, but one extra factor here or there is usually not significant - which is as it should be.

On supply, the system works very sensibly, without being too much of a burden  - you have to spend some time getting your supply lines right, but not much time fussing over them once that has been done.

Movement is similarly smooth - the ability to force march and to counter march creates a quite dynamic and flexible turn, as far as I can see.

I like the scale of the game (and the ability to bite off bigger or smaller chunks as you like).  Perhaps most importantly for me (and this is purely a matter of personal preference), the game captures a believable "feel" for the period and the type of warfare being depicted.

For me this is an exciting improvement on games like The Longest Day.  It is destined to spend a lot of time set up for solitaire play, rather than to be dragged out against live opponents.  But it is quality.

(It is also the only time a game has inspired me to contemplate writing a review for BGG, which I enjoyed doing.)

RATING: 10
This is an unappreciated operational game. It's a bit dense to get into (I played with the designer at a con), but it is a rewarding view of the conflict in Poland and East Prussia at the start of WWI.  TWiE has the best railroad rules of any game I've played, giving you a great view of what delayed the grand advances in 1914.  The 2 tiered combat system leads to a lot of surprises.  Merely leveraging the 3:1 does not guarantee a grand victory, and the more men you commit, the higher the potential losses you may suffer as an attacker.

RATING: 5
This gives a great feel to the action at the division/brigade level on the WW1 eastern front. The feel of the lack of mobility, the combats, everything makes it, to my mind, the best representation of WW1 that I've played. However, to do that, this is no longer fun, and it feels like work. Really wanted to like this one, and I appreciate what it does, but I want more enjoyment in my games. Sold.

Great simulation, slow game.  Well thought out and comprehensive but takes forever to play. Player aids are eyeball-crunching and poorly laid out. The set-up rules are in spreadsheet format, which can be a pain. I prefer the separate charts a la East Front Series.

Upgraded a bit after I received Dispatches and the C3i additions, which removed most of my problems I had with the game. The rail and supply rules are amazing, and the combat system is incredibly involved. You want to march your army top speed through forests and swamps? Go ahead, just be prepared to pay a steep price. Think artillery is overrated, try attacking without enough of it.  Think cavalry is obsolete? Just try to ignore a cav division within striking distance of your HQ. Those minor road bump blocking units which most other games ignore all the sudden become a problem when you have to waste a turn or two to take them out. And so on...
This is a masterpiece which just gets better and better every time I roll it out.

This really is a very good game.
The combat system has been described as "unwieldy" but a battle takes a couple of minutes to complete. Because it is impossible to know exactly what will happen in terms of retreats, unit strength losses and loss of combat effectiveness, it is a more realistic representation of combat than your typical one dimensional "16 attack points versus 4 defence points" systems. Additionally the strategic objectives set at the beginning of the campaigns are a really simple but effective way of making you behave (to some extent) as the real commanders had to, even though you know it's a bad plan.
In fact it's an excellent game.

For me the perfect operational system for WWI. A very playable game and a very addictive system. A fantastic rule book: it's the first wargame I play without questions about the rules. I've already played all the scenarios. Now I want to play the big campaign. I've also played the small scenario from the second game in the serie: offensive à outrance and can't wait the new game about the serbian front.
Just one thing: I would like to see a Marne scenario in Offense à outrance.
Thanks a lot and congratulation for your great job Michael!!!

WWI eastern front goodness.  Now Austria-Hungary can be managed properly!  Smashed into the Russian flanks at Galicia, causing Morale Levels to drop for the czarist army.

RATING: 7
This game is a very determined and serious effort in simulating the opening stage of the fighting on the eastern front during WWI. A large amount of research has gone into TitE and the game definitely provides a feel for WWI combat. 

Graphics are top-notch, especially the map.

However, the learning curve is steep. The combat system provides reasonable results but could have been simplified. The supply rules could also have been streamlined a little more.

Terrain has surprisingly little effect on combat results, especially considering the scale. 

If you are going to play the full campaign scenario you should be prepared to put in a serious effort. We are talking committment here! The structure of the game turn sequence where both sides move all their units twice per turn is very timeconsuming. A serious amount of down time is also created as you wait while your opponent is moving his pieces.  

All in all, a good simulation of WWI combat that would have been even better with a little more streamlining. If you are interested in operational WWI combat you need to try this game.

RATING: 5
I have found this to be an OK game, fun to play. It is a monster game in all respects, huge map, complex rules, and a lot of decisions to make every turn. We've played the campaign game for 6 months now, meeting once or twice a week, and I expect we will be playing the game a year from now too before we are done. 

A lot of research has gone into this game and it shows. I doubt there is any road or railroadline the designer has missed. The rules for combat contain a high degree of uncertainity wich is a good thing, since you make your decisions from overall feel for the battlefield rather than odds-counting. The rail and movement systems work well as does the supply system. 

The are a number of things that in my opinion makes this game merely ok, rather than good or excellent. The combat system is a bit too clever, and takes quite some time to become fluent with, and I can't shake the feeling that the same effect could have been accomplished in an easier way. The terrain does not affect combat (except for rivers) which for me is a major miss, since each and every account from the war speaks of the huge effect forests, villages etc had on the battlefield. Then there is the problem of runaway cav, since once a cavalry element gets behind the enemy lines it can very much ruin an entire front with impunity, cutting railways etc without being regard for the distance to friendly lines of support. This forces the players to keep unhistorical lines of units and ZOC:s across the map. The last point keeping this score from being higher for me is that I feel that the losses from combat, especially artillery, feel low. 

So a fun game, komplex and huge, does alot right and some things not so well.

RATING: 8
Fantastically detailed study of the opening months of the war in the east in WWI.  I've played through one scenario after also setting up the extended playthrough and working through that.

This is a very intimidating monster at first glance, with 8 countersheets, 5 maps, and 48 pages of rules, including lengthy set-up grids.  However, I found it have one of the best rulebooks I've ever read - right up there with OCS in terms of clarity, and wonderfully cross-referenced.  The extended example of play, in particular, cited rules used very well.

Also, packed full of wonderful historical scenario notes!

Wrote an AAR for the scenario I played (Dragoni Variant from C3i 26) here on BGG.

I have played this after playing 1914: Offensive à outrance which improves the system, I would say that it shows it's age, and doesn't have the streamlined feel that Offensive à outrance.

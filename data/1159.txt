A great game.  Why?, well....

Its just so much fun in many ways. There is conflict, but more for scarce safe locations than just for the sake of it, plus conflict is generally not a great idea because the defender has the advantage. Then its fun to play around with the dinosaur enhancements on your board, like how many places could you put that new horn you just got? Its fun seeing what the weather is going to do and who is going to get screwed the most. And more fun when someone plays a card which messes up the weather and causes even more problems. And the bidding mechanism is awesome, giving excellent player interaction by forcing people to bid against each other for something they might not really want!

The game shines in that it could easily fall into a 'bash the leader' trap, but it is limited how much you can do that without completely compromising your own position. So the person who plays the best through the game *should* win.

And the cards and brilliantly engineered. They may be game-winning, but only if you play them at just the right moment. And that moment may never come.

There are multiple paths to victory: go with eggs and maximise population, adaptability to climate to have your dinos survive longer. Horns to deter other people coming near you, genes early to pick up better enhancements the rest of the game, cards late on to try to get lucky and sneak the game.

And the art is cool. And you get wooden dinos.

And the board system means it scales well to different numbers of players.

And you don't know if the game is going to end this turn or not because that asteroid may or may not arrive.

Initially seemed very fun and thematic, but I quickly soured on it.  A bit too random, and starts slow, and then ends too suddenly.  I'm hoping Ursuppe is what I thought this game would be.

A wonderfully fun game with a few simple strategies for keeping your species of dinosaur alive that're very fun to implement. The theme, art, and relative simplicity means its easy to get non-gamers to play, but it still provides some food for thought.

Just not enjoyable, like Small World wasn't enjoyable for me.  I have very little interest in playing this game now.

Cute game, I'd most likely buy it due to the theme if it was at normal prices, but nowhere near worth that much as its going right now.  I think The game seems to need another round of playtesting cause there are moments that just aren't very clean...such as having to always roll dice for initiative.  I would take this over small world.  The mutation/climate change make it more interesting for me, I think because it gives a sense of the passage of seasons, which Small World lacks.

Enjoyable game with 5 players. I really stink at it. Play it with one less gene in the auction phase for added fun. I'd also like to see what it's like with only 3 players... I think the decreased playing time would be a good thing. UPDATE: The three player game is SO much better! We didn't use the 'one less gene' variant but played with our cards face up on the table. What fun... I'm definitely keeping this one around for some more plays. UPDATE: Good game but I don't play it. Time to pass it on. UPDATE: sold!

This was one of four games my RPG gaming group back in high school would whip out while waiting for all the members to show up (you know how it is, someone is always late...) It is a great fun game about dinosaurs and meteor strikes, and who can predict what direction evolution is going to take. I love it! I didn't win the first game, but I came pretty close in the second. And ever since then I've been looking for this game to buy my own copy. I have some cousins who are about the right age to get started learning about how dinosaurs can evolve to have parasols...

This game is heavy on theme, i.e., evolution. A theme I hate and with good reason. The only reason I did not give this a "1" is because I my game group might want to try it and I won't throw a fit over a silly themed game.

RATING: 6.5
One of the better auction game with map presence games, not quite area control but the random nature of the climate, direct attacking and card play from other players can really destroy your chances but it's quite tough for everyone and quite light hearted so I'd happily play it every now and then. 

Looking at the box of the new edition is terrible, not the fun cartoony style game I'm used to and don't expect it would be as fun with a more aggresive stance.

This goofy/fun/silly game has a solid theme and I love Dinosaurs.  I love the silly artwork and the game play is quite fun.  Less "Euro-ish" than its contemporaries because its theme is stronger and it has a decent amount of randomness in it, with a touch of direct conflict (dinosaur battles).  It's not going to be confused with Ameri-Trash, but it tries to reach out and take some of the elements that makes A-T great and uses it to boost up a Euro.

Did I mention it has dinosaurs?  Did I mention that they get to fight?  Yeah!  Dinosaurs make any game better.

Lot going on in this game.  This is not a bad thing.  Many variables to keep straight.  Cards almost too powerful to play hidden.  Never hit the table after the first play.  Traded away.

RATING: 7
+ Making changes to your dinos and playing out your strengths make each play through just different enough to keep things interesting.
- The climate track is a little confusing and hard to explain at first.


Why it's previously-owned:
I enjoyed my plays of this game very much, but in the end, if I want a contentious, map-based multi-player game, there were better choices.
I gave this game away to a friend who I had played it with many times.  When we choose an in-your-face knock-out struggle game, we now choose Cyclades.

I have played a few times and did not click for me. Not bad, but it is not a game that I would choose often. I liked better than Ursuppe, but I am still looking for a good "evolution" game.

I enjoyed this area control game, very simple mechanics and not too much to think about, the secret in this game is in the bidding, you bid your victory points, so it is very difficult to measure the impact of your choices in the game.

This one sat on my shelf, unplayed, for several years.  What a mistake.

Great game, with a rather novel "auction" mechanism (update: I like the implementation of this auction in "Hollywood Shuffle" a bit better...check it out if you like Evo).  It's quite fun, evolving your species to best deal with the environment, and holding off on playing your special cards for biggest impact.

First play with 5:  Cute and amusing.

Second play with 3: Not particularly compelling gameplay, seeming a bit too much "rinse and repeat" repetitive for my tastes.  The auction system in particular felt very underwhelming and artificial.  One horn total became available, and the player who got it, dramatically tipped the game in his favor rolling and winning virtually every battle.

Fun game with lots of decisions, which require you to balance out short term vs. long term gain. This allows you to come from behind if your long term strategy plays out. The bidding for mutations makes this game very balanced as the more valuable mutations will be bid up higher.

The second edition has better artwork and streamlines some of the mechanics making it a smoother and more enjoyable play.

the bidding/scoring track is garbage.  needs a colored die for each player.  other than that, i love the components.  cute art, great modular board, and i have a strange affinity for wooden discs.  i've only played with the N-1 variant mentioned in the rules, although we didn't play the extra turns.  the cards do seem off kilter in terms of balance, so i'd like to try at least playing with them face up.  still fairly fun, but have no inspiration to play.

RATING: 6.5
If you are looking for a lighthearted end of days game, the EVO can be that tongue-in-cheek experience.  Game play is easy and mostly silly, but with enough interest to keep it from breaking down into an utter mess.  If played too seriously, I think the game is likely to push back in protest.  when this happens, the game usually wins and the players are left with a giant huh?  So if approached correctly, this cna be a nice longer filler or light main title.  And play with the right people.

Absolutely fantastic game.  Mechanics fit really well in the theme.  The idea is really surprising.  Components are good, on the funny side, but work fine in general.  I do not like the umbrella for protecting against sun...  The most difficult part to get on with is the climate chart.  I also liked the idea of the end of the game because of the meteorite...
UPDATE: After playing the second edition, now I find the umbrella to be a really cool element ;)

RATING: 8
A immensely clever and sorely underrated game. The biggest luck-swing mechanic is also the one that new players find the most confusing - the die that controls the changing of the seasons/ice ages. But once you learn to anticipate this and work hedging strategies into your play (or just appreciate a beer and pretzels side to an otherwise strategic game, and gamble) the rest of the game shines through as tremendously fun. 

Tying a bidding mechanic to the ability to have more natural territory control in a board wargame is a good concept, perhaps at the heart of this game, and one that deserves further exploration.

There is a bit of luck in determining the weather and the cards that are played, but it is somewhat predictable, leaving room for planning. There is a bidding aspect of gene selection which is fun and challenging. As a plus, this game will appeal to kids! I have now played it several times and see there is lots of room for strategy. The optional rule allowing for one less gene than there are players is the serious way to play. Careful use of cards can give those extra points for a win. Great game.

I really care about game components. When a game has quality pieces that look nice, it makes the game more exciting for me. This game has the potential for great components, but I find that it's lacking. Game play, however, is very good. The game is balanced, there's lots of player interaction, and the theme has been incorporated into the game mechanics very well. Once my fiance and I make our own dino boards, this game will probably become one of my favorites.

In its heart this is really an abstract game. Very much like Keyaerts other hit Vinci/Small World. Nevertheless the dino theme is incorporated pretty well. Some of the artwork and cards of the game are very well done and these also add to the theme. So what could have been another heartless euro is turned into a game with a high fun factor. Because of the relatively low complexity it can be played with a broad group of people. Something in there for all of them. And did I mention it was funny? Highly recommended!

What a cool game!  I like how you gotta keep fluid in where you are at in accordance to the climate.  In this first game, I didn't get any horns, and I paid for it as I was consistentely kept on the edge of extinction.  We used the 'gene for every person' auction.  From now on, it will be the one less than people playing...more tension.

Update:  I liked it better with four than with three.  We played with the straight rules...we all think the n-1 rules could be a bit harsh. The game was tight and ran a bit long but I think the pace could pick up if we play sooner than later.  I took a look at the new version and decided to take this version off my trade list.

I love the evolution & dinosaur themes.  I think the chaotic nature of Evo is the biggest turn-off.  Chaos comes from the dice-rolling (for climate change) and the action cards (which can put a hurting on players for multiple turns).  Primary sources of player interaction in Evo are the auctions, dinosaur battles, and placement of baby dinosaurs.  Auctions can be good or bad.  I think auctions are tough for newbies & casual gamers because these players don't have a handle on the "true value" of items up for auction.  Another reason Evo tends to annoy me is the whining... why did you attack me... why did you birth your dinosaur in the only spot where one of my babies could survive... so-and-so has more points, why didn't you block/attack him instead, etc.  This definitely makes the game drag.

Fun game - with a great theme. Best played using the variant 1 gene less than the number of players. Main problem is the cards are wildly variable in power - get a 'good' card you're happy, get a hand of chaff and you're not :( Possible fixes - draw 4 cards at the start, pick 3 and when you get a 'card' gene search the draw pile and pick a card (makes card gene much much more popular).

Cool game, but possibly too many opportunities for screwage.  I would play it again with a more defensive mindset.  I tentatively rate this a 7, based on one play.  Update:  long games with attacking option are unlikely purchases for me.  Will play but won't buy this one.

Es un juego sencillito de supervivencia de dinosaurios. Tiene una rueda de clima que determina qué clima va  a hacer en cada tipo de terreno en el próximo turno. Al final de los movimientos y nuevos nacimientos, solo sobrevivirán aquellos dinosaurios que se encuentren en las zonas climáticas apropiadas.

Además, tiene una fase de subastas, en la que se puede pujar por conseguir una variación genética que otorga ventajas a la raza de dinosaurios del jugador (mejor adaptación al frío o calor, poder volar o nada, mejora en combate, etc).

El juego es entretenido y rapido, pero a dos, a pesar de lo que diga la caja, desluce bastante. Lo suyo es de tres para arriba. (hasta cinco). Además, es cortito, en menos de una hora está ventilado.

Don't let the cartoony cover art fool you: this game is surprisingly strategic and clever. The points you use to bid on mutations are also your victory points, which makes being good at cost-benefit analyses a necessary survival skill in this game. I've never played with the "Evil" rules (where there is one less benefit auctioned each round than there are players), but I could see how that might change the game in an interesting way, as being as cheap as possible is often a great way to succeed in this game.

A very fun theme combined with great game play makes it very enjoyable!  The board play and bidding are both excellent and mesh together very well, and the unpredictability of the climate and card play really keeps you on your toes.

I don't understand some of the comments from low raters about game length, as most plays only take slightly over an hour, and I've played many other games of this all clocking in right around an hour to an hour and a half. 

Overall, just a fun, solid game that I always enjoy.

Slightly disappointed after first play. It's a little bit long and at times boring. The auction was fun, though. Surprisingly, I end up comparing this to the Turkey of 2006: Tempus.

This game is almost really good if it wasn't for too many random factors that influence the game in a big way. A few unlucky dice rolls and you can be out of the game and find it difficult to get back in it as survival of the fittest dictates. But rolls for Climate, Attacking and the random cards with great illustrations just make the game very chaotic and random.

For as easy as it is to teach, as much fun as it is to play and its relatively short length (60-90min), I can easily get past the luck involved in the game. 

11/29/09 Dispite the luck involved in the game Ive won 4 out of 7. The key is to not bid for mutations to high as you are actually bidding with your victory points for end game. Geez, fighting dinos are fun!

7/30/11 A few games ago we stopped playing with the cards.  The game will probably stay up around a 9 forever and ever.

The glaring negative is the action card deck, which is wildly chaotic and unbalanced.  There is plenty of game and flavor there without it. On the other hand, the art on the cards is kind of funny. Maybe bidding on the cards face-up would fix the problem. With that variation, it could rate higher.

A game I'd like to like more than I do.  A problem is that genes bid for at the beginning help a player the whole game, whereas genes acquired late in the game only affect the last few turns.  So, a bad bid early on has harsh consequences and little you can do to overcome it.

After one play I am in the middle on this one. I like the Dinosaur theme and the idea of the game, similar to Small world, and add some random elements, like card play and more dice rolls, but the game felt too repetitive. The random acts really eliminate planning. I don't know if this game would fall in as a family game or a gamers game, but overall, it wasn't bad and it wasn't great.

RATING: 6
I've finally been able to play a proper game of this and I enjoyed it, although I'm not crazy about it.  The available choices are well balanced, such as between genes, and although you may get out bid on one they all tend to be good.  The game progresses quickly while still having some real depth to the planning.  Planning which can of course be upended by the climate in a pinch.  Overall a fun and easy to understand game, although the components and game play seem a bit bland.

I originally took a shine to this cute game.  Good mechanics, flows quickly, auctions work well, has conflict and movement tasks.  We play with the variant of one-fewer-item-than-won, and also with 1 action card face up per player.  But in the end, it's very much a game where you're at the mercy of who attacks you, which makes me a bit less interested in playing it.

This game is fun.  There is a winning mixture of different elements.  The n-1 auction rules are a MUST (use one less gene than the number of players in the auctions).  

The game allows for some flexibility in long-term strategy...plenty of tactics and direct confrontation...nice balance of auctions and the clincher...the currency is your victory points.  That is what really makes the game work in my opinion.  I also love the idea that everyone dies at the end of the game. Sure its a chaotic little game with a healthy dose of luck, but its fun. A few of the components (like the scoring track) are a bit annoying, but the art is cute.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Presentation: cute to the max. The little player boards that you put the evolutions on are worth pulling this game out alone to me. The game itself, has some interesting concepts that also make it stand out. For example, the weather changes that make the terrains radically alter from hospitable to scorching with accompanying problems for your wee beasties. Of course, evolutions will solve many of these problems, but even the hardiest critters can't survive in certain areas, creating a constant pull as you need to move from one area back to another, with everyone crowding into the same terrain types. Unfortunately, there are a couple of things which hold this one back for me. Firstly, the combat mechanism has some problems, you need to have evolved beyond your opponent to even make the odds 50/50 which makes combat a very iffy proposition, this makes it hard to deal with a leader in many cases. Secondly, the cards. They are a neat idea, but they inject a significant amount of chaos into the game, which, unlike the weather alterations, is largely impossible to plan for with any accuracy. I still like some of the novel ideas in this game though, the way the different players evolve to be skilled in different areas makes the late game fascinating as certain players have no worries about cold climates while others can move all of their creatures out of trouble zones due to extra mobility and so on. Worth a play every once in a while, but the problems do hold this one back for me.

This game has some of the most clean, efficent rules I've ever read.  It's a perfect example of how to present game rules in a way that is easy to learn and easy to teach.  The game itself is a terrific middle-weight game, perhaps a little lighter than Vinci and more playable than that (also excellent) game.  Highly recommended, this would be a good second or third purchase for the newbie (after something like Settlers or Carcassonne)as it is simple to play and teach, is good fun, but also features some deeper strategies and introduces new elements such as auctioning.

Played with 5. If you have Ursuppe or Urland you might be a bit disappointed. Seems a bit slow, we rolled a "2" five times in a row, so there was no weather change for 5 rounds, resulting in a very static game. Fights are not too exiting, we had only two in a whole game (ended early with an sudden death/die result meteor strike).

This was fairly disappointing after 1 play. It may not have helped that every time someone attacked (even with a 2 horn advantage) they lost so there weren't many fights (rendering many of the cards useless). The umbrellas were a ridiculous adaptation and seriously detracted from the game. The game ended up being won by a special card worth two points and was otherwise a 3 way tie. I may try it again but I am not looking forward to it as I was before the first play. May drop to a 4.

RATING: 5
This game boasts disarmingly cute drawings, a pleasing rythm picked up very easily by newcomers and non-gamers, a die, and a fairly unique mechanism to alter the playing board via the 'climate'. It is fun to see your dinos 'evolve' and become more resilient to the various areas, and as such the game certainly has an appealing character. On the other hand, for a game this randomised, it takes quite long; also the first few turns are very boring because everyone is miles away from eachother so that survival isn't a big issue. It only began to get interesting in the last three of four rounds, but since it takes so long to get there...

There has been some talk devoted to various variants with this game. First is the rulebook-suggested 'X-1' variant, which has players bidding on one gene less than the number of players. When I compare the games with and without the extra gene, the games with the extra gene were rather tight affairs with slow starts. The fun comes in from evolving your way out of tight spots, and mildly annoying your opponents with the right card(s). When genes are drawn totally at random, introducing an artificial shortage doesn't seem the way to go, really. So I don't play with X-1 anymore. The second is actually a group of changes proposed by fellow geek ronlee. Number of genes = number of players; no cards at the beginning of the game; cards open for all the world to see. Much like Aladdin's Dragons, really, where that concept works wonders in removing the annoying sting out of powerful magic cards. This too led to a rather boring game because the first half sees everyone just walking about without major issues; and if no card genes are drawn the game becomes too static.

It is annoying to conclude that the game in fact derives much of its competitiveness from the fact that unpredictability is introduced via gene cards; but these render the game a bit unfair too as you directly interfere with the ability of players to grow, and thus to obtain points. You don't get sufficient genes over the course of the game to evolve your way out of a tight spot; after all, your opponents get genes too. All in all, I dropped the rate another notch, where it will probably stay indefinitely.

[b]Update[/b] I let this game go to another collection where it would be looked after with more care. In a way I'm sorry to see it go as I liked the idea of capturing evolution in a game; but this game didn't do it in a way I would have liked to have seen.

Those who refuse to play this game because it doesn't agree with their theology need to take a chill pill and give this a try. The "evolution" theme is pasted on, with only the special action cards really giving it any sense of being a game about evolution. The game loses a point for 1) the climate adjustment mechanism lacking a couple of graphics to make it easier to remember which way is good for parasols and which for fur, and 2) too much wackiness with the cards you draw. People may also dislike the semi-random game end mechanism, although I think it just adds to the tension in most cases.

Good and quite an original game in the way it recreates the spirit of evolution and survival. Not a lover of massive-dice games, this one tries to balance the rolling with results cap, but I would have preferred, at least in fighting, a mathematical way of result resolution. Cards are easily misinterpreted unfortunately, rules do not point out clearly what to do in simultaneous play of events...
Quite similar to Primordial Soup, prefer that title to this one.

Appealing theme and great bidding mechanism. Bad luck can make or break, so this will never be the choice of die-hard gamers, but plenty of scope for strategy keeps this high on my list.

The good news:
Improve your dino with tusks, hair and long tails in order to survive in a ever changing world. It's amazing to see how the different mechanics all fit together.  
Easy to explain, plays within 1 hour and due to modular board very well playable with 3, 4 or 5 people.

The bad news.
Some genes are a bit wacky (solar screens?), but once you've accepted that, it's okay.

The Verdict:
Tense and easy-to-learn game. If you're looking for a good simulation about evolution, don't play this game - play American Megafauna.

A charming but not particularly scientific take on evolution as a mechanism.  The game has you bidding on your adaptations, has a simple climatic system to drive change and simple combat rules.  The art is very cute as well.  For a more realistic game, try American Megafauna.  For more abstract, try Trias.

Good components. It plays very well with any number of players.

Multiplayer wargame: remember to keep a low profile or you will be bashed to ashes. Too much randomness is involved to make it really interesting. It comes to an end a little bit too soon (just when things get interesting).

A good little mix of mechanisms here:
Bid for enhancements
Breed/move attack with your creatures
Wither depending on your placement
A few take-that action cards
Earn points from surviving.
The game flows quite well and is straight forward to play once your in it. There's good bidding tension along with varied strategies to take maximum advantage of your enhancements. I also like that the number of action cards are limited to avoid too much chaos. It is very easy to reel in the leader, but that's not a major fault.

Plenty of room for screwing with your opponent(s), and just plain fun as well.  This is truly a gem, and I can see why it was so hard to get hold of.

This game was too random for the amount of rules that it has.  If I am going to learn a game with this many rules, I want them to give me control over the outcome.  While I think this game was intended to be simple enough to play with non-gamer friends, I think there are many other games that do a better job at filling this niche. 

--Edit-- 
Raised my rating to a 5.75 based upon a recent play.  It was more enjoyable this time for some reason.

A game of dinosaur evolution that feels very much like Ursuppe, in that you purchase genes and move dinosaurs in such a way as to ensure their survival. While the game works, and the cartoon art is very cute, I&#039;m not sure if Ursuppe owners need to pick this one up as there feels like a lot of common ground between the two games. Seems to play much faster than Ursuppe, with a lot less interaction between the types of genes.

This one was a big hit with my family and friends, and got played constantly for awhile.  I got bored of it and lent it out to a friend, and have just recently received it back.  Perhaps I'll be more interested in replaying it soon.

Update: Played this twice recently, and was reminded what a well designed game this is.  It always seems to go over well with other players, the theme is fun and new players are able to understand the mechanics fairly quickly.  I'm still a bit bored of it myself but this game deserves a good rating for being such a consistent hit with new players.

Interesting middleweight family game. Overlooked game for beginners and family-gaming types. I'd recommend this one right after Settlers for a good introductary game for all types. However, it can drag a little too long and it doesn't exactly have a ton of replay value. Always play with one less gene than the number of players; otherwise the auction fails to auction anything!

I enjoyed the theme and components. It has some interesting mechanics.
The game is fiddly - and unfortunately it doesn't do much to help you keep the game flowing smoothly. The "upkeep" of the game distracted me from strategy and fun.

I kind of got rocked by a Deluge card, but I wasn't doing very well anyways.
I'd play it again, but probably would never suggest it.

Good integration of the dinosaur theme.  Nice watching your clan of dinos grow and mutate and head for the best climate spaces on the board.   The climate itself is a major wildcard, and combat is equally unpredictable, so the game can feel a bit random.   But I guess that's okay with me, it gives it some tension.   Cool art and interesting card play that reminded me a little of how the cards work in Zombies! for some reason.   Seems like this would be a good family game.

I played Evo a few times a long time ago and have very fond memories.

Evo has an interesting theme and is very beautiful to look at. I would like to play this game again. Evo is a good interesting game for non-gamers.

There are lots of genes to chose from. Each gene in Evo does something different. Bidding for the different genes is great. Bidding for the different types of genes is very important in the game of Evo.

It`s especially important if one or two types of genes are very rare in the start of the game. A very good one to have early in the game would be the horn to fight better. It can make a difference in the early start of the game if you are the only one who has one. Fighting other players can be very cool too. 

Depending on the type of genes you have, each player can have a different game plan and that is what makes the game interesting and have a good re playability. It's not always the same thing each time.

Only pay a higher price for genes in particular situations which you think will bring your game around. After all, it's the most points who wins and we bet with points.

Another thing that I like in this game is the fact that the weather changes during the game. The cards add an element of chaos in the game. Overall, some interesting ideas.

You must play this, even if it's only for the vast amount of confusion that the climate track produces... "What? It's hot? But I have umbrellas? Does that mean my dinosaurs are dying? I thought it be the other way round."

Bruno Faidutti explains this game well when he says that this game takes many simple mechanics and combines them into a fairly complicated game. Philippe Keyaerts' Evo is a strong middleweight game that combines some Ameritrash style combat, bidding, card powers, and other dice-driven randomization into a great game. There is no overpowering mechanic in Evo, bidding may be the most significant regarding the endgame, but I wouldn't consider this game a bidding game. It is fun, however. 

After about a year since my last play of Evo, and my last consideration of playing Evo, I've decide to part ways with my copy. I still don't think it's necessarily a bad game, it's just a little dated and clunky for me.

RATING: 6
Fairly fun the first and so far only time I played.  Lots of player interaction later in the game, which can also be frustrating.  I suspect this would wear thin after only a few plays, however.  Probably most fun when played infrequently.  Genes need more variety and each player should have a unique starting dino with special abilities.

Very cute dinosaur evolution game with some light (make that "lite") wargame elements.  There is a perverse appeal to the goal, which is to be the most-evolved species of dinosaur at the moment that the meteor hits the Earth, killing you all.

My only gripe is that it always seems to end just as things are really getting started.  I usually wish there'd been another turn or two.

RATING: 7
I really like this game.  The auction mechanics, species modification, movement and combat dynamics, and just the general flow all really work for me.  The only drawback is that for some reason this game always seems to overstay its welcome.  I have never played a game where all of us weren't looking at the information board and asking, "When is the meteor coming?"  Maybe the answer is just to start the meteor up a few spaces at the beginning.

Just an eensy-weensy bit too fiddly for quick play with friends - the survival phase particularly gets me, but then again I'm the kind of player who wants to check all the other players' dinos to see if they survive...

I had the old version of this game and while I played it a few times, I never really loved it. When I saw this new version cheap in my FLGS I snagged it quick. 
The production upgrade is huge. A massive effort has been put into this to bring it up to date.
For me, I don't think the game is as good as it could be. Its not bad, and it can be very engaging, but it just doesn't thrill me the way I really hoped it would.
I can see myself playing this another 4 or 5 times and then selling it on (again).

I like the speed of this little game.  some of the cards seem overpowering, but it fits in with the theme of extinction, and the game is so short it doesn't seem to matter that much.  Certainly the weak get weaker & the strong get stronger--again, fits with the theme.

We always end up laughing in this game, usually due to the extinctions. Although a lot of the fun comes in the battle bidding.

There is a significant amount of strategy in this simple, short, easy to play little game.

So glad I was able to find this out-of-print game.

EVO is a dinosaur-themed game where each player tries to rack up the most mutation points for their species, until all the dinosaurs are killed by a meteor, ending the game. I would characterize EVO as a middleweight game with a silly-ish theme. It's a good way for non-gamers or younger gamers to learn basic game elements like "tile" (dino) placement and bidding. The game isn't great - it suffers from too much randomness (climate change, combat resolution, power cards, genes auctioned) and no corrective mechanisms. It's also too long for what it gives (a 4P game plays out in 60-90 minutes). Despite the houserules recommended here on the Geek, I'd only drag this out when a non-gamer audience was at hand. Otherwise, there are too many superior games to choose over EVO.

First off - BEAUTIFUL GAME! (The 2011 edition; not the earlier cartoony version.) I mean, they really went all out for artwork and components. Really impressed. I know there's a backstory to the dinosaurs here, along with some sort of symbiotic relationship with mystical human leaders blah blah blah... overlook it: it looks quite unnecessary. The mechanics here have all been done before but they're tied together very nicely in this game. Good bidding mechanic and area control. I like the building up of evolutionary traits. Quite a bit of randomness will never make Evo a strategic game purely, but it's part of the game's charm here. It does appear very difficult to catch up if you lose steam early on. And things get a bit chaotic during the endgame. Still, I'm looking forward to trying this again some time.

The theme and the gameplay go especially well together in this game. The auction system is great, the genes you are bidding for have a fundamental impact on whether you win or lose, and the fact that you are bidding using your VP-s makes you think twice. Seems to end too early and to be thrown off balance by the event cards and dice rolling, though. Definitely better with the advanced rules.

Probably the Euro with the strongest theme I have, and who doesn't like being a rampaging dinosaur?  I like the gene auction mechanic, especially since the value of each gene is hard to pin down, depending on weather, terrain, and neighbors.  It's just a little long for my group.

It's simply a good game. It has got a couple of mechanics going on and looks very nice. It's quite simple and isn't overwhelmingly random. In fact, it's less random than Settlers of Catan and it could make a better gateway game IMO.

Based on two plays: one that was ok, one awful.  I like the auctions for genes, but the action cards are WAY too powerful.  When one card can put a player (who wasn't me) from a solid second place to utterly out of contention in one turn, there is a problem.  I might be convinced to try it one more time IF the cards were left out.  Else, never again.  I'll stick to the far superior [b]Urland[/b], [b]American Megafauna[/b], or [b]Trias[/b] for my dinosaur kicks, thanks.

Can seem quite hard to catch up if behind or to pull back a leader - often as you feel the need to get a better set of gene updates which probably require more mutation point costs as everyone else wants them to.  That said, I suspect this will reduce with increased expertise.  I also suggest trying different strategies - one game I did relatively well with no extra legs, horns or parasols in a 4 player game (mainly just eggs and fur and a bit of tail).

I suggest giving it a go.

RATING: 6
Interesting mix of planning and extremely swing-y randomness (battles, climate change, event cards).  That's not always a desirable combination, but here it adds to the humor - which is already the game's strongest asset.  I can see Evo being a very good family game, and it was perfect as the closer to a long day of gaming.  Played just once so far, and it's difficult for me to rate because a lot of the fun came from the table talk rather than the sheer gaming goodness.  I can definitely tell that this is the same guy who designed Vinci.

The game is quite cute, but the best part is getting to arrange your mutant on your personal score board.

Rating after one fiveplayer game. Evo has already many traits of later games with development and direct confrontation mechanics. The map's adjustable to the amount of players and some action cards add some spice.
Ergonomics are ok but the board which traces the victory points, which is a bit too small. update: after three games I left my initial rating to seven.

Too bad this is out of print.  This is light/med fun themed strat. game.  Not my favorite game ever, but would be fun to play again.

RATING: 6
An interesting development game where you increase the number of dinosaurs you can save from varying harsh conditions. There's an auction element and some move/placement factors combined with the somewhat controlled randomness of the climate. Overall, I didn't like it as much as I had thought I would based on reviews and 'Geek buddy comments. The game seemed a little too mean (the cards especially), but maybe that was just the group I was with. One player felt out of the game early, and then spent the rest of the time just playing spoiler. I don't know if this kingmaker aspect appears in every game, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite enjoyable but I got screwed in a big way on one turn by the weather changing the wrong way to the norm. That left me trailing well behind with little chance of catching up. Second game I rolled three 1's in a row for the weather. That obviously screwed a few people up. We played with one less tile available for auction each turn too so that made it more cut throat.

Some of my friends find this boring. Solution: 1) Start with 4 cards, choose 3. 2) Each player selects 2 genes to start the game with. Leg/Egg/Horn count as 2 genes  3) Competitive bidding
 -> a much more fun game.

(Original 2011 edition copy). Enjoyable family Eurogame.  Players are dinosaurs adapting to their environment and staving off their inevitable extinction.  It blends several mechanics nicely: auctions (to "mutate" into more adaptable dinos), good old fashioned "hose your neighbor" card play which breaks the rules, and territory management/planning.  

The artwork on this game is cartoon excellence (although one card is slightly "adult" - see threads).  Great for kids - non-confrontational gameplay and not too much of a brain-burner.  Much fun adding mutations to the dino playmats. Who doesn't love dinosaurs?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this one has been one of my best acquisitions of the year. It looks like a simple game in the beginning, but as you move on, every little decision becomes so important. Are you going to "invest" in fur or parasol to protect yourself from upcoming climate changes, in tail to gain the initiative advantage so that you can move your dinos into safer territories before your opponents do, or in feet to obtain mobility across the board? Constantly tough decisions await you in this game. Eventually you will find yourself fighting with other players' dinos for space, and if you don't have the "horn power", you're in trouble. Great artwork, fast-paced, well-balanced, nice pieces. Need I say more? Buy it, you won't regret it...

RATING: 5
As in many games (e.g. Goa, Aladdin's Dragons, Tempus), the special action cards are critical; if you get a good selection, you can crush others, if you don't, you can be crushed by those who do.  (Or you can luck out by what other people play.)  Plus, you can't easily get cards (unlike Goa, where you can get one for the cost of an action), and when you do win an auction to get one, it might be of little use to you.  Generally, I think that this game would be much more enjoyable without the extreme upheaval caused by the action cards.

Also, we always have arguments about how to play cards.  Basically, you have to enforce the rule that any player who wants to play a card must say, "I'd like to play a card", at which point you go through the players in initiative order, asking each in turn if they want to play one.  After someone plays a card, then anybody can start again with "I'd like to play a card".  If someone breaks this rule and blurts out, "Okay, I'm playing my Quiet Eon card now; no more cards can be played until the end of the turn", this causes serious trouble, because everybody earlier in the initiative order technically has the right to play their cards first, but would they have done so if the blurting player hadn't stated what card they were going to play?  So, always ask first, and go through the initiative order!

I'm annoyed by the "Deluge" card.  The card text states that you should roll for the survival of every dino, but it has an erratum that states that it affects only the dinos on coastal hexes!  If you're unaware of the correct wording, that can completely change how you play the game.

We always play with the limited gene variant to make bidding tighter: in an N-player game, only auction off N-1 genes in each evolution phase.  With this variant, if the bidding goes to 3 or 4, passing (for 0) can be a great strategy.

What a great game about Dinosaur evolution. This is, in some ways, the family model of Eklund's BIOS:Megafauna. It's a lot of fun (so long as players don't drag it out too much) and the art is all too beautiful.

RATING: 5
Didn't do much for me. The auction wasn't high-stakes enough to be very interesting--everything that appears is useful and there's something for everyone so it all goes pretty cheap. So that leaves some heavily constrained board movement and a lame die roll based combat mechanism. Even the theme is a little off, with aliens or spirits or something messing with the dinos' genes. Why?

(2009) Similar in theme with Trias. The interesting mechanic here is not drifting land tiles, but changing climate! Also, getting to evolve your dinosaur is pretty cool. However, it seems that whoever gets the first egg in evolution may run away with the game, as was in our case. Will have to try it again and see.

Update (01/15/12): I finally got the 2nd edition reprint/re-theme. I have moved most of the comments to that entry.

Looking at past reviews, there are a number of significant changes between the first and second editions: 1) initiative is based on bidding position for the mutation/adaptation genes, and tails have been done away; 2) climate change is based on a token draw instead of a die roll; 3) combat die is no longer a regular D6, but has symbols which serves approximately the same odds as before; 4) there is a 1-in-6 chance for a stalemate, otherwise depending on the difference in horns, the defender will have a dinosaur [i][b]removed[/b][/i] from the game, whereas previously it was returned to the owner to possibly be regenerated; 5) evolution occurs after climate change now, instead of later in the turn; 6) movement/combat happens after evolution, instead of before; 7) there are 12x climate tokens, delineating strictly 9 to 12 turns, with the a game-ending "meteor" event occurring in one of the last three climate tokens; 8) players only have 8x dinosaurs max, so elimination due to combat is more devastating, while the older game had 10x wooden disks; 9) there are 12x new "special" genes, 8x of which are mixed in with the regular genes, each having a unique power/ability, such as flying or amphibious movement, chameleon capability for defense, or ability to predict the future climate; 10) island size is based on number of players (it comes with islands for 3/4/5 players, just like in Small World), instead of adjusting the number of turns; 11) one event card is available each turn during bidding, with "number of players minus one" genes pulled out of the bag; winning the event card will give the player first initiative, only modified by number of dinosaurs on the board.

The gameplay shares a very similar feel with Dominant Species (and a little bit of Trias), but plays in 90 to 120 minutes. It keeps it very simple: climate change, auctioning for mutation/adaptation/events, turn re-ordering, movement/combat, breeding, and survival. Turns are deceptively fast, due to the very focused and limited choices every player has. Because of this, if feels like it has been tightened significantly. 

Initial rating was a '7' when playing first-edition, and now bumping it up to an '8'

A very good family game with bidding, multiple paths to victory, and just enough chaos and player interaction to keep things hot.

It's rather light (read:  weak) as a gamer game.  But with a couple of rules tweaks it can be downright nasty:  

1) # of players minus 1 for number of genes each round

2) players start with zero cards, and 

3) cards up for bid are face-up.

UPDATE:  Been replaying this lately (Summer/Fall of '11) with the straight-up rules-as-written.  Works just fine, sans tweaks, for what it is.  Fun, with some neat little systems.  Succeeds in evoking the weird bloat and contraction of migration, population explosion and massive die-offs.  Rating up from 7 to 8.

The game could do without the tails.

Eggs seem to be super dominant in larger games - especially if some players are doing poorly.  When some players leave a lot of slack the high population players can do better than if they faced fierce competition from slower breeding dinos.

It took a couple plays for this one to grow on me, but, you know, it's pretty clever.  Bidding on the tiles is a really important part of the game.  The cards are very situational, but that's okay.

The bidding mechanisms in this are great. It's a lot more fun when you play with the optional rule of less cards to bid on than the number of players.

Oh, Evo.  How do I rate thee?  The mutation mechanic was cool (I love customizing things like that) and the climate changing track was a nifty little idea.  Unfortunatley, I'm not as sure about the length, the randomness in the cards as some were incomparably better than others, and ease in which kingmaking can occur.  The game is OK I guess, but there's really nothing to write home about here.  It's a mix of good and bad and in the end it does comes out in the clear...just not by much...  The bits were super cute in any case.

EVO is a great family game. I love the dinosaur theme and the cartoonish dinosaur players boards, genes and game cards. Uses a competitive auctions system to allow players to procure genes to allow them to differentiate their herd of dinosaur to become the most successful. The idea is to try to become the most dominant species of dinosaur on a small island with a rapidly changing climate. A meteor determines the end of game which is variable. There is a new version of the game with more serious art and a couple of rule changes but I'm not sure its all an improvement. One of my all time favourites, a great game ... and highly recommended.

Definitely waay too random to be a brain burner and too complex to be a light, family game.  I don't like games that only pretend to be deep and create illusion that you have control over your performance.

A pretty neat/cute little game that might have got rated a little higher if I had not already played Kramer's Wildlife.

Unbalanced cards, a little long, decisions are obvious however it is a little meaty and fun. Too much luck really to be taken too seriously though, very cute components but the scoreboard is terrible, they didn't leave enough room to put more than one scoring piece on a spot which happens a lot, they should of made FLAT pieces, at least this doesn't effect gameplay. 

The whole weather aspect is very cool and one of the neat parts of the game but in the end I would rather play Wildlife.

RATING: 7
This is a real favorite with my group.  Evolution and struggle for survival is the theme and everyone dies in the end.  Half the fun is finding cool places to put horns and tails on your dino.  Genes are generally balanced, but the tail is a little weak as is the mutant unless you get it early; however, don't get behind in the horn race!  Personally, I like the cards, but only in the auction-only variant.

RATING: 6
Strategic and tactical, while simultaneously luckier than all get out. The best-laid plans of Brontos and Pteros may run afoul after the climate goes the wrong way, a 2-horn attack rolls a 6 or someone plays a really nasty card. Amusing game, though. Nice components. Bidding is challenging and competitive. Alas, a tad dry with drag potential. When the board gets congested, it's not uncommon to wait for five minutes while an opponent analyzes where best to go... and then changes his mind! Kingmaking problem.

The random appearance of the meteor may be realistic and add to the drama, but it usually makes the winner random too. It's a long way to go for one die roll...

That said, Evo is probably my favorite "experience" game--the games where people say it's not about the game, it's about the experience. You'll have fun, but your intellectual side won't be fully satisfied.

I've been increasingly disappointed Eurogames offerings.  For me, Evo looked great, seemed to have interesting mechanics, but was not fun to play.  Follow this with A Dog's Life and their many non-game Blue Box offerings, and well, I won't get fooled again.  I'm amazed by how many people like this game.  For me it was the beginning of the end.  I will not buy another Descartes-Eurogames product.

My rating for this has climbed steadily ever since I got it.  It's climbed at least two whole ratings.  I don't think any other game I've rated has done that (except possibly Ra).

Another game that I seem to forget that I don't actually like it.  It's not bad, exactly, it's just too long for what it is.  And much too susceptible to the "gang up on the leader (or anyone else, for that matter)" problem.

RATING: 6.9
haven't played this one is 6 years (2005 and now 2011) but this is still a good game.  was sad we didn't play with the official N-1 auction variant to spice it up.  Sadly it did come down to luck in the end... I had 2 chances to win it on a die roll on the meteor strike, instead it struck the 3rd time just after an opponent passed me by 1 (it was also partly unintentional king making of another player that needlessly took 2 spots I could have given birth in which would have given me the win due to my card that let all my guys survive the hot environment)

Initial Rating: 9.0 (September 2011)

What a surprise!! I wasn´t expecting much from this game as it is from the same designer of Small World (a game I don´t particularly enjoy) but I am glad I did play Evo.

The Good: Nice components and art, relatively short play time, great mechanics (I love the auction and the end of game mechanics) and theme (evolve or die out, of course you all end up extinct at the end :D)

The Bad: Generally, I dislike games with too much randomness, Evo has a lot of luck with the climate change (but you can play with the probabilities) and the cards but somehow that doesn’t bother me, it just add to the fun. I just write this here as it is the only thing I could eventually complain about (but it is unlikely :P).
What I didn’t like was the little umbrellas; they are the only thematic glitch in an otherwise brilliant game (have to see the new reprint).

Evo is a must have for me, I can´t wait to play it again and I totally recommend it.

Not sure about this rating anymore, as I have played the 2011 edition and I have not enjoyed the game as I used to. I have to play this edition again to reassess my opinion however I like the humorous mood this edition imprinted onto the game and so far I have not felt this in the new edition so for now this edition gets a higher rating than its counterpart.

I played again and I enjoyed the game. For me, this is the better edition of the game. The game components are superior and, ultimately, I hate the climate changes they did on the 2nd edition AND (perhaps I’m wrong), I think there is no tails on the 2nd edition.

I’m downgrading its rating to a 7.0. Still a very good game, not one I would like to play very often, but I’m usually open to it. The best game I have played from Philippe Keyaerts. 

I previously have rated this a 9.0 because I enjoyed my first game AND I was new to the word of boardgames. Now I can rate (I hope, but who really knows :D) a little more objectively, so Evo is a 7.0 for me.

I think that this one has a lot of fun in it. 

It's cute graphically, easy to pick up and learn to play, and each game is quite varied in how they play out. I like the shifting environments for survival as they force you to move and think ahead. 

The advanced bidding game is best by far, but let people who don't know how to play use the basic bidding as they learn. It's not a complicated issue really as the advanced bidding is just removing one gene from the bidding pool. If you have 4 players, there would be 3 genes availible for bidding in the advanced game. In the basic game you bid 1 gene per player.

Why do I say to use the basic game with rookies? To let them learn more about the genes and to make sure they get one in the bidding and aren't shorted. If they get shorted a gene, because they don't know how to evaluate its worth, they will not be competitive against you and are less likely to enjoy there game/learning play. Don't pound the rookie in other words. :)

Evo is a bit rnderated by many; I don't say classic is it's status, but I do enjoy it. I got this very cheap at a clearance sale and am very pleased with it. It was a very nice surprise find.

RATING: 7
Update late 2011: I picked up the Asmodee re-release and played it 5p yesterday. Production is very attractive - I think the art suits the game better than the original cartooney look. The additional unique special abilities add some variety and make for some fun combos - killer flying babies rock! Seemed to take longer this time around, although I suspect that was people pondering their moves longer - maybe the less cartoonish art makes people take it more seriously?!
---------
Nice mixture of light wargame (those spaces are really hexes, hex and counter lovers) and tech-tree expansion. There are four types of terrain on the board, and the survivability (if that's a word) of the players' dinos in each fluctuates with the climate. This means players cannot settle for long as (after the opening rounds) there is usually competition for the currently most favorable terrain.

Players must also manage how their dino evolves, with an auction each turn of tech builds that can improve your dino's fighting strength, survivability, reproductive abilities etc. While I'm not exactly short of games with an auction in them somewhere, in this one you bid VPs which makes it trickier than most; if you really want a particular build you can probably have it, but is it really worth 10 VPs, given a winning score in the thirties or forties (for a 5 player game? 

Only played once, and was glad we left out the cards at the recommendation of the player who ran it to leave just the core game.

Nice game all in all, although there's no way I'd pay the 100 Euros/100 dollars prices people are currently asking for second hand copies.

I'm not familiar with the changes in the new addition and think this one (2001) works great once you understand what direction the climate moves and how heat and cold affect the board spaces.  Love the Amun Re /  Cyclades bidding mechanism.

RATING: 7
Nice theme, nice components, lots of fun to play, scales well for any number of players, a novel bidding system... so why only a rating of 7?  The cards.

Normally I like a bit of randomness in a game... I like a fairly high luck factor.  However, the cards in Evo seem to be VERY imbalanced.  Almost game breaking imbalanced.  Almost.  Which is why the game is still a particular favourite of mine... and a 7 rating.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely has strong potential to be an a-hole game.  It is a great one to break-out every now and then.  The mutation auction is the only part of the game that I believe needs improvement as it's a little too random for me, but it works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
This is a fun game that has an auction system that I really like (when played w/one less adaptation than # of total players)!  A board that changes sizes depending on the # of players, luck and tactics and a great theme make this a really good game. I upgraded this game from 8.5 to 8.75 as I played with a couple of non-gamers and it went over well.

The artwork is kind of cutesy, but the game can be challenging, requiring more planning than it first appears.  I like the auction phase (especially with the n-1 card variant), which plays a huge role in the game.  The dice roll can be quite unpredictable as well.  In one game, the weather never even got to the right hand side of the board.  I think this would be a good intro to meatier games as my kids get older.

Najlepszy mechanizm licytacji w ogóle (prosty, efektywny i zrozumiały); bezpośrednia konwersja w punkty (jeden dinozaur = jeden punkt, przez to elegancko i łatwo do kontrolowania przebieg gry); dobra kombinacja elementów taktycznych (rozmieszczenie dinozaurów na odpowiednich polach i walki o nie) i imperialnych (ulepszanie swoich dinozaurów przypomina ulepszanie państw w grach imperialnych); stochastyka (walki, pogoda).
MINUS
Tematyka może nie taka ciekawa.

Chociaż forma (tematyka i klimat rysunków) nie zapowiada szczególnie poważnej gry, to jednal treść wynagradza zaufanie: naprawdę udana gra imperialna zawierająca kilka aspektów i fajne mechanizmy.

PLUS
Best bidding mechanism there is (straight, effective and plausible); direct point conversion (one dinosaur = one point, making control of game progress easy and elegant); good combination of tactical elements (positioning of dinosaurs on suitable areas and fighting for them) and imperial elements (improving your dinosaurs reminds of improving your state in imperial games); stochastic (battles and weather).
MINUS
Theme may be not the most interesting.
SUM
What the form (theme and vibes) does not promise (no serious game, rather a funny dino game), the substance keeps: a successfully designed imperial game that contains several aspects and good mechanisms.

But then there are these special-cards which ruins the game. And the fact, that you don't have any chances if you lost a lot of animals in a middle of the game (and that can happen easily, when some will use his special cards). Just too much chaos. That's sad, because there are many good elements too.

The newer edition I have no desire to ever play again.  The art was garish and horrendous, the gameplay was changed to the worse with some of the special genes, and the climate wheel was not an improvement over the orginal setup.  Play the original for a better game.

========================================================

Seek to have your species of dinosaur dominate the continent through mutation and keeping a careful eye on potential climate change.  Watch out for the special action cards...they add a bit of chaos and frequently even more nastiness to the game...:-)  I think it is a better game with 4-5 people to give more opportunity for genes to come into play.

Nice game with an excellent theme and fun gene auctions.  As a biologist, it’s fun to notice that the points are in some sense the population size of your species, which should indeed (for large populations) be roughly proportional to the rate of fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.  A drawback to the game is that there is some direct combat in which a few rolls can make a big difference to the score.

Lot's of fun.  Remember to aquire horns for your species early, or you'll get skewered as I did!  Some of the cards are a bit chaotic, but luckily they aren't played that often as "draw a card" tiles are not so numerous in the draw bag.

AUCTIONING. EVOLUTION.

I enjoy this game a lot.  It seems like a nice game to play with pretty much anybody.  For some reason, finding others who like it as much as I do has been challenging.  Maybe they don't enjoy the cutesy artwork like I do? 

It doesn't help that for the (English) game I have, all the cards are in German.  I have a translation sheet printed out from BGG.

RATING: N/A
Pretty looking BUT has a 2 hour playtime.

Components as listed on back of box: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/107979/evo?size=original

New edition has board modification and playability for 2-5 players. Also has a wheel for tracking (http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1158182/evo). The wheel, however, is NOT unanimously preferred by all. Here is a review talking about the differences in the old vs. new versions: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/660255/differences-between-eurogames-and-asmodee-editions

It's definitely worth keeping the original version (NB:the colors are much more user friendly). The only downside is that there is no 2 player mode.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not my cup of tea *at all*. I can see why some would like it, especially if you're a dinosaur fan. Some families would probably like it. For me it had the appearance of a serious game - bidding mechanism like Amun Re, interesting climate mechanism, multiple strategic options, some combat. But then when you play, it's a chaos-fest. The cards throw in a random element that mocks you for thinking it a strategic game. I got decimated by a combo of a climate reversal then a flood card, and buried the next turn when a 1 in 6 climate event occurred. For an hour and a half, I would never ask this one to come to the table.

Fast paced, tactical game ("react quickly to the situation" is the motto of the game). There's luck, but the game is about minimizing its effect on you. Play with the "variant" (one less gene during auction) to make it a really tense game. Fast paced. Scales well. Cute humorous artwork.

This just didn't grab me.  Seems a little too random and I didn't really enjoy  playing it.

Nine years later it still doesn't do much for me.  Bleh.  Also, pretty boring when horns don't show up in the auction until the next to last round.

An OK little game, but a bit too abstract for my tastes. A handy chart that tells you what the different mutations do would be helpful.

RATING: 6
A game which seems half-formed, with some good ideas but equally some rather puzzling mechanics. The climate changing the spaces needed for survival is a great idea, and having pieces to maneuver on a map in a Euro is alway a bonus. But the "one less gene" variant would really help to keep the auctions interesting, and some genes - horns and eggs - seem a lot more useful than others. And if you get behind on horns or eggs, you're in trouble, because you won't be pulling in the VP you need in order to bid effectively to bring you up to parity so there's a big "rich get richer" problem. The combat mechanic which makes it very hard to defend against creatures with just one more horn than you, seems a bit flawed too and makes the horn over-powered. Still, we had some good laughs playing this. Especially considering all the "I've got the horn" jokes you can make.

Rating based on 1 play. We played with the number of mutations for auction equal to the number of players and we saw some competetive auctions. I'm not convinced after 1 play that the N-1 varient is needed. Perhaps my next game I'll try taking whatever I can get for 0 and seeing if that works. What the auction really needs is the Amun-Re rule where you can't over bid on the same item.

This is another great game for introducing new players. The first two turns have no real consequences so you can teach the rules as you go. But by mid-game when dinosaurs are competing for good feeding and breeding ground, the tactics and tricks are as rich as almost anything. Evolving cute dinosaurs adds to the fun. I much prefer the 1st edition of this game precisely because of the fun and cartoonish design.

RATING: 6
Great theme.  Love the components.  The game play is fun and light.  my only gripe would be the randomness of deciding which genes are biddable on a given turn.  There's little incentive to bid higher on one gene versus another.  it leads to a bit of "I should just bid as little as possible for any gene since my resources and my victory points share the same pool.  Still a fun, quick filler play.

A good game, the use of 'mutation points' as both currency and victory points is a good mechanic.  The climate changes being die based(2/3 chance of going forward, 1/6 chance of staying the same, 1/6 chance of backtracking), makes for an interesting monkeywrench in any 'finely tuned' schemes.  Not my first choice to play, but one I'm almost always amenable to.

A good game with a fun theme. The rules could be much better in clarifying certain things. Pieces are nice (although, I think little wooden dinos would have been GREAT instead of the dino tokens that come with the game). I consider this a middle weight game as there is some strategy involved in planning your mutations and how you move about the board to survive. Gameplay itself is pretty simple (once you figure it out). There is also conflict resolved with dice rolls as well as an auction phase. Overall, very enjoyable!

Claims evolution, but is really not.

There are several phases and basically you are trying to get your animals into the target climate area. You bid on components that allow you to move your dinos, improve turn order, and help protect them against too hot or too cold of climates.

Various genes can be purchased each round (auction) to help your species handle the climate and other competitors and special events by way of cards can help manipulate the action. A good game, excellent family game and for me a better game than Primordial Soup as it takes out some unnecessary complication.

I've played this game several times now.  You bid on genes to out-compete your opponents.  Unfortunately the player with the most bidding points at the end of the game is the winner so you have to balance getting the genes you need with saving your points.  

You each control a herd of dinosaurs trying to keep as many alive as you can while also whittling away at your opponents herds.

I recently bought some rubber mini dinosaurs and the game looks even better than before.

RATING: 3.5
This is too simple of a game, with most of your decisions being very obvious. While there's no runaway leader problem (because people will gang up on you), there's a runaway loser problem as you just can't turn the tide in a turn or two, considering victory points are cumulative over turns.

Speaking of points, the system is also very "rigid" in that most of the time, players score a similar amount of points over turn. The winner is often the one who picked up the right technologies at the beginning of turns, or situated in locations isolated from other players, so that they can grind a slight advantage over turns.

This also takes too long to play considering you don't mke much decisions.

The lack of variation and thinkiness makes it even worse than another game of similar genre that I do not like, Small World.

Ok, game.

Good and simple for introducing new players. Need to play it again with more than two players.

Edit: Now played it with both 4 and 5 players. The rules are simple enough to explain quickly.

Some minor issues:
Can one give birth in chains? say place a newborn next to nothing but another newborn? (we allowed this)
How do you keep track of last turns turn order, when the turn order markers are used for bidding? (we used a dino to mark what it was before)
Is killer Babies considered an attack? (we agreed on "no")

Other than these miner issues, it was a good game. Not one of the greats, but a quite solid game and fun game.

RATING: 7
Game where one tries to spread dinosaurs over the map and survive other dinosaurs and the elements. Genes are bid for every round. Attacks are resolved by rolling a die, which may detract from the strategy. Some cards are also more powerful than others. Good game, usually clocks in at 2 hrs.

Nice mechanics, I like the bidding system.

I don't like the map interaction, even if it seems fun: if everybody picks on you, you're out for good (similar to Small World).

Also, the game seems to be a bit long, but I' m willing to give it a try.

RATING: 8
First impression (4 player) : I really like how the whole idea about "evolving" creatures has been streamlined into a very simple form. Climate changes and creatures either adapt to it, move to different areas or die. In our game there was only one new set of legs seen during the game so surviving was quite a bit more challenging than usually and it didn't help that climate changes were bending the laws of probabilities. So there is healthy dose of randomness (and action cards add some extra into mix too) but it fits the game well.

Evolving dinosaurs. Two major flaws: First, it's mostly about gaining territory. Second, it has the wrong kind of randomness, which makes the game neither fun enough nor serious enough.

A decent area control game (that feels quite like an abstract, like checkers), with an action point system that you have some control over, and a nice, easy-to-play auction mechanic. I personally found the climate board to be confusing, as when it shows "cold mountains", we are all trying to cool down with parasols, and when it shows "desert", we are all trying to stay warm with fur.

_Parasols_ was the best they could come up with, theme-wise??

Great middle weight game, auction and area control. Some say the cards are too random/chaotic, but the game would lose some strategy without them.

The cards add an extra strategic element to the game, since you can base your upgrades on what's in your hand. Better with more players. I prefer the standard version of the game, as opposed to the "n-1 genes" variant.

A fun game.

Plays well, although seems to lack a little something when playing with hardcore gamers.

RATING: 7.5
Looked forward to playing this for a while because of the dinosaur effect.  Was what I expected, pretty fun.  For some reason the game took much longer than it felt like it should have.  Sometimes it is hard to keep track of moving and what spaces are safe with the climate.  Look forward to playing it again, dinosaur games always get bonus points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game is a delightful combination of a beautiful and quick auction process to buy improvements to your dino, followed by moving and birthing dinos around the board into the spaces so that as many dinos as possible survive this turn as possible. There are 4 different "climate" colours on the board, and on any 1 turn, 1 particular colour will allow limitless dinos to survive, and 2 will allow 1 dino only to survive, So it's a competition to get into the limited spaces, and that competition is both fuelled and alleviated by buying improvements, which increase movement, allow you to have more dinos in the limited colours, place more than 1 dino on the board each turn, etc. The auction and valuation of these genes is tricky - they can skew depending on what genes come next (which of course you don't know), so you need to be mindful of paying what an improvement might be worth if the same improvement type doesn't appear again for some turns. Which means the valuations are never easy and a continuing challenge - sometimes you get it right and sometimes not. If someone gets an egg (more births), or a horn (displace a competitor) on the first turn, and no more come out for 7 turns ... we'll, there's the valuation challenge. You want to get the right combination of genes to handle both the expected and the unexpected climate changes each turn. Throw in some event cards and it all comes together neatly in a 60 minute package that offers many interesting choices, a nice competitive level of interaction without nastiness, and a feeling of satisfaction as your dino evolves and outwits, outlasts and outplays the other dinos. Playing the advanced game where 1 less gene comes out ensures premium and competive values are paid on all the genes, but I enjoy both the basic (where you might get some bargains) and the advanced and am happy to play either.

Managing your heard of dinosaurs is quite fun, however it has a run away mechanic since points are also used for bidding, so the better you are doing, the more likely you are of being able to buy what you need. Also, on the first play, you don't really know the value of items, so you should play twice and for gamers, use the variant where there is one less item for auction then the number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dinosaur evolution theme.  It's interesting the way the mutation mechanic adds abilities to your species of dinosaur so that it can better survive.  More eggs, more movement, heat- and cold-resistance, etc. The climate thing can be a little confusing to new players; you have to remember that the "moderate" climate doesn't stay the same, and that the "hot" and "cold" terrain is relative to whatever "moderate" is that turn.

What appears to be a cute little game about dinosaurs is really a highly tactical game.  You have to plan carefully how you will expand around the board, as well as how much to bid on the various gene tiles.  The gene tiles give huge bonuses, but you can't spend too much on getting the ones you like, because it's your points that you're bidding away.  I absolutely love the art with the dino boards and how you can visually construct your dino however you like; this is irrelevant to the game but a lot of fun.  There's a little bit of dice-rolling, which injects some randomness, but as a tactical game it's a winner.

A definite leader in the gene-management category. Tend to overbid for cards for comedic value. Never quite figured out if the climate board was telling me we are about to need fur or another bumpershoot. The area management mechanism seemed to take more time than it was worth. A worthy idea, and led me to seek out more games by Keyaerts.

Wonderful game.
Don't be fooled by the cartoon art.
This is vicious, in all the delicious ways it should be.
Aggressive auctions for genes (with your victory points no less), to adapt your species to the changing climate and to the other species trying to muscle in on your turf.
Balance and timing are very important, but the cards and dice add enough luck to stop this being calculable.
Above all, great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I thought it was decent implementing changing climate and moving to various terrains, different boards for different number of players, the simple evolutions, and the variable end condition of the comet ending the game.

The bidding for evolutions wasn't implemented decently.  Using victory points and either everyone gets one (with hardly any bids) or n-1 bidding didn't seem to work too well and not really thematic.  There seemed to be more rules than there should have been and the attacking will turn off some people.

Who can play?  Family game for 3-5 players.

Another favorite.  It's cute enough to get new players to try it, what with the little dinosaurs that get more legs or more horns or more fur as they evolve.  The bidding for genes for evolution is a fun and fast system.  Movement is simple as it gets.  Unfortunately, the climate chart is a doozy, and is the factor that seems to make or break the game for most people.  Still, most people like this one, including me of course.

A much more streamlined Valley of the Mammoths.  Everything moves quickly and smoothly, and the strategies in one's biddings are incredibly important.  I have no problem with the chaos of the cards, though 3 may be too many to start with.  Players don't get many more throughout the game, either. We don't play this quite so much any more, but it's always a good time, which is the most important thing.

Impression on 1st play with 4: Best with 3 to reduce spectator time during movement and bidding phases (although latter complaint may change with one less gene than players).As not all the genes and Event cards come into play, tactical considerations will differ in each game and so there is replay potential. The experience for some was marred by: some confusion over the terrain colours with the terms hot and cold zones, the direct intent in conflict and die results. The meteor game ending mechanic with the scoring status on show is a simple delight. The clear and simple rules are a joy. So far the best dinosaur game I&#039;ve played, but shame it&#039;s not educational.

Some really nice innovative ideas and mechanics, such as the change of climate and the ways you can increase your protection against each type of climate. But the action cards introduce so much chaos that overshadow your careful planning and preparation for the weather changes and auctions.

RATING: 5
Update: I have had the opportunity to play the new, revised version ofthe game. This is a great improvement over the original. The two factors that improved the game are the changes to the cards (they are far less powerful) and the lack of starting genes. From the first turn players are in a tough spot and the bidding for genes (especially for cold and hot areas) becomes far more critical than in the original game. It has a significantly more serious feel to the game. I prefer it to Small World which is simply too chaotic compared with Evo.





The game looks great and the auction portion is fun however, the game is dull.  How this could have been selected as Games Magazine's game of the year is beyond me.  There is simply nothing to be excited about here except the auction portion and I would rather play Modern Art or Medici.  Dull, dull, dull...

I've always enjoyed the auction system where overbids force players to rebid until everyone has bought exactly one item. It's used in Amun-Re, Peloppones, Vegas Showdown, Last Train to Wensleydale and I'm sure others. Was Evo the first? The game also has a good sense of humour (which it looks like might have been lost in the new edition) and it's clear it shares some DNA with Vinci/Small World, especially in the way players expand over the map and score each turn for their current extent.

Finally got my hands on Evo after it hanging for years and years in my wishlist. I had never played it, but had read the rules and seen it played, and it always struck me as a really wacky theme, but with a serious and well-thought game mechanics behind it.

RATING: 6.5
I came away with a positive impression of Evo. The climate system was tense and strategic. It almost falls prey (pun intended) to Small World bash-the-leader syndrome, but has a couple of tricks to soften that. First, you can never attack someone who is down to only two dinosaurs. Second, the defender of an attack has a built-in advantage. Despite the less-fun theme, I would easily recommend this game to Small World fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The best option is to play without the cards and with the 'killer' rule (number of genes for sale = number of players minus 1). If you're playing with the standard rules and with the cards, the game is only worth 5/10 !!!

Funny game where you get to evolve your own species of dinos and put them against other players' creations to find out who is the boss of the planet. Despite the funny theme this game has plenty of tactics to think about. As the climate changes you need many legs or other genes to help you to survive. Battles between species use dice, but are modified based on fighting ability and aren't too common. We play the game using the official "One less gene" variant which makes the bidding for different genes more tense as the cheapest bastard of the bunch gets absolutely nothing. Nice components, only the scoretrack is too small.

This game has been outclassed by more modern games.  Unfortunately, I played it years after it was still "new" so the inherent novelty of bidding with your victory points, etc. had a diminished effect on me.

Excellent fast paced game, easy to learn, doesn't take to long to finish.
Cards add too much randomness, but bidding for "face up" cards tones it down a bit.

RATING: 8
After a bit of experimentation, I've settled on the following variant:  1.  # genes = # players.  2.  All cards are bid on face-up, but may be kept hidden once won.  3.  No cards given to players at the start.  With these rules, Evo becomes a fabulous game with just the *right* amount of luck (in my opinion) instead of the chaotic mediocrity of the original game.  If you lose, you can generally point your finger to what you did to lose.  Now, what makes evo so fun?  It combines a number of problems into one very cogent and sexy theme (dinosaurs who evolve and fight!).   Both my gaming and non-gaming friends have really taken to it because of the combination of auctions, tactical considerations, and generous conflict.  There are plenty of opportunities to make evil plays.  There's enough to think about, but enough luck that no-one has any incentive to think for too long on their move.  Finally, the theme is excellent--it's very fun to develop your dinosaur from a crippled one-legged puppy into something monstrous with horns in places you would never have guessed could have horns.  And then terrorize everyone else on the board.  Or alternatively, try to survive in the shadow of aggressive monsters.  Though it's more fun to terrorize.

RAWR!! This game is really cool! I like dinosaurs, and getting to play as my very own dinosaur was a lot of fun. I didn't take this game too seriously when we played it, but I found it just too easy to have fun.

The mechanics of the game are really cool, and it is pretty interesting to see how each player's dinosaur species will evolve. My only recommendation for anyone reading this is to get your hands on an egg ASAP!

Thanks, Frediccini! I love it! It's SO MUCH FUN!  I appreciate your taking the time to find the out of print, slightly goofy version.

Should evolved dinosaurs have parasols? YES!
Should players be able to make a dinosaur look like Ringo Star with a brand new mop of fur over the forehead if they like? Absolutely!

The new, serious version took all the fun out of it for me, so thank you SO much!

Nice, quick and simple conflict game that fills the same niche as Small World (or the other way round, as EVO is older).

So -- this game seems to take about 30 minutes too long.  It was a really fun game back when it was one of the few that I owned, but now that I've experienced a lot more -- it seems to fall flat.  

The game gets better when you put out one less mutation than there are players (one of the listed variants) but still not quite good enough for me to want to lug this one out over others in my collection.

I will play it occasionally, but it's often left behind during gaming events.

Lots of risk taking when bidding on the genes - will another couple of horns come out next turn or will that be the first and last we see for the game. A very aggressive and mean game. Rating has fallen with repeated play.

I dislike everything there is to dislike about the graphic design in the new edition. It's harder to interpret the temperature changes. It's harder to glance at other player's boards and see what they have. There are strange pictures of people on the player's dinosaur boards. I know they took a lot of time and effort to jazz up the old edition and make it more attractive for sale, but it's just not for me.

RATING: 8
One of the best light multiplayer wargames around.  Even when it looks abstract, it is very thematic.  Dinosaurs are struggling for the maintenance of their species fighting not only other species for the best spots, but the wheater conditions.  As the game goes on, species evolves trying to adapt better to their environment.  The game ends when a comet hits the Earth causing the extinction of all dinosaurs.  The game looks very similar to [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200&Itemid=1]Small World[/url][/i], another design from the same author, in many ways, like the different terrain types and the easy rules to resolve conflicts, nevertheless they are in fact very different.  I like [i]Evo[/i] better.

Never played Ursurppe, so I won't be comparing it to that. This is a fun game for 3-4, that will at times have vicious fighting for balmy spaces. You can play it with two (despite the box saying you need three) but this make auctions a little dull. Every round the climate changes (1/6 chance it won't), where spots get hotter or colder. Get too hot or cold, and no dinos survive there. When spaces are somewhat hot (or cold), every dino you have on them that you can provide a parasol to (or fur) will survive, and the others will die. All dinos in temperate zones survive. The goal of the game is to accumulate mutation points, and you get one point for each surviving dino each round. Mutation points may be spent during the auction phase (which I think is well done), where players give up some score to obtain new mutations (fur, parasol, extra feet for movement, extra horns for combat bonuses, etc); this reminds me of Vinci except here it's done as an auction. You can pick a particular strategy, say, hover around the colder areas and stock up on fur, but lets say your neighbor has horns and threatens to fight if you migrate towards him; then you either have to dance around him or move away. Or perhaps your fellow players keep outbidding you on fur. So you have to remain adaptable (this is a game about evolution, you know). Players start with three cards that each alter the game in unique ways, and you can "buy" more cards in the auction phase. This game is pretty straight forward to play, each turn you maximize your dino survival, and minimize mutation point spending at auctions. The game is separated into individual phases, which makes it easy to follow and keep the flow going. A number of phases may be played simultaneously, or are merely administrative things that one player does. I enjoyed playing this game and would love to play again soon.

How can you not like a game with little wooden dinosaurs in it?
And even more, a game in which everyone dies at the end regardless?
The Event cards are somewhat random (a common problem with any game including this element) but this can be fixed.
Only play this with the "one less gene than players" variant, although care must be taken not to let the "no bid" player from running away with it...

Cute dino game! I love the art, I love the idea of mutating your race, and the bidding part is well implemented.

I've just moved on to meatier games, I guess.

Better than I expected. All the genes are basically similar, but the basic game is fun. However, like many games, the luck due to certain random rolls can wipe out the progress you make from tactical play. Accessible to younger players.

Things I would change:

I would add a changable board, like Settlers of Catan.

I would eliminate all dice rolls in favor of something more deterministic, like Civilization or something similar.

Definitely try it with one less gene than the number of players.

[1 play] This has potential to be a really fun game for our family whenever we have a little longer window of time to play. Evo was great to introduce to the kids because it incorporates area/resource control, sophisticated bidding, turn sequencing that makes initiative control important, a simple combat resolution table, and other clever mechanics and scoring. The theme is well integrated and fun too. There was lots of laughter and banter. The terrain/climate mechanism drives the conflict, so there is always a reason or justification for who is picking on who (something I thought had first been well done in Nexus Ops, but clearly pioneered here much earlier.)

Overall a tremendous game which I will be pleased to introduce to adult gamers as well. I am so happy that I held onto this game (and this particular version with the cute cartoony artwork) until the kids were old enough to enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting concept that sees players manage a variety of game aspects (moving to suitable terrain to match the ever-changing climate, an auction, battle and cardplay). The idea is to move and breed dinos that translate to VPs. VPs are used in an auction (which feels thematically weak)to get enhancements for your dinos (cute). Clever use of climate to force dinos to move around the board. The event cards are tad unpredicatable and perhaps a little too varied in nature (boy are there some duds).

There's a tendency to bash the leader and it felt slightly too long for what it's about. Great looking components and graphics though.

Evo just doesn't grab me. It seems like a great family game (with older children), or a good game to play after a group has whet thier appetite with a TtR or some other intro game. There are a variety of mechanics at play here: bidding, area-control, etc. - but the way they blend together just doesn't excite me. It's like drinking flat Coke. The taste is the same, but without the fizz, I'd rather drink water. (Forget for a moment that I'd rather drink water most of the time anyway!) In Evo, each player is trying to ensure that her herd of dinos survives climactic changes by moving around among jungle, mountain, beach, and hill country. At certain points in the game, players bid on genetic enhancements for their species - such as the ability to better survive cold weather (and so on). I found that Evo produces a fairly tight game, which is great. I also really like how you can put the two halves of the board together in different ways to suit the number of players. What a great concept for keeping the game balanced as you scale up or down in players. Evo isn't going to see a second playing in my house though. It is a good game, but after one play has not generated a "Let's play again" request. It's hard to put my finger on why this is so.

 A lot of fun if players don't spend too long micro-maxing, but a little is required.  Better game if cards are shown.  Made some blank tiles to put in the draw bag, to increase importance of bidding.  Recomend 6 Blank Tiles, place them back in the bag to increase the tension. Nice and amorphic.

We have a Russian translation of this game, which has some minor implementation deficiencies -- the cards are not as sturdy as you wish there would be, the dinosaurs are carton circles rather than figures, etc. This lessens the enjoyment somewhat. There seem to be a rather substantial random component to it, as the climate swing at the turn before last may sweep out half of your dinos, and you may not be able to run fast enough to new lands if you were building fighters say.

Love the concept and the fact that the species competition involves fighting to the death for advantageous territory.  Also love the climate timer mechanism so it's not so predictable.  However, I think that it goes on for too long.  I'm going to propose a fix next time that will start each player with an extra leg and egg, and put lots of two genes up for bidding for the first two rounds, and also reduce the number of rounds by at least 3.  I bought and painted mini dinos for my set.

Can't really form a good opinion of this one on just the single play; really need to bring it back to the table again. Played it with three, and probably need to play it with more players.

RATING: 7.75
A game where the aim is to keep your dinosaur species alive, and in numbers that give you victory points, until the dreaded cataclysmic meteor strikes.  To do this, you need to keep moving your dinos to temperate zones as the climate changes.  Each turn there is a sort of evolutionary auction where you can bid for enhancements like a leg (additional movement), an egg (increased numbers of offspring), a horn (helps in fights with opposing players' dinosaurs), and a fur coat or parasol to help them exist in slightly colder or hotter climes.  'A parasol!?' you say - yes, you read right (don't ask me ...).  The turn phase sequence takes a little getting used to, but is not too difficult.  There is lots going on, and decisions to be made, to keep the players' interest.  Good fun, and recommended

Nice evolution-themed game. Doesn't make it to the table very much, unfortunately.

--- Summary ---
Player start with 1 dino and 3 gene cards. Determine climate, which determines the ideal terrain in which to have your dinos. Dinos start with a fur and a parasol, which allows them to survive in colder/warmer climates (but only 1 step different from ideal). On your turn, use movement points (start with just 1) to move dino(s); can attack, but advantage is to defender if equal strength. At the end of each round, surviving dinos have babies (start with 1/turn), then score VP for the number of dinos on the board. Then auction (use VP to bid) off a mutation (random tiles drawn from a bag: horn, egg, foot, fur, parasol, mutant gene, gene card -- which help with fighting, reproduction, movement, cold/heat tolerance, auctioning, or give you an extra single-use ability). Advance the turn marker at the end of the round, and check for possible end of game (roll d6 in the last few turns on the track). The player with the most VP at the end wins!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unique and enjoyable.  The auctions are by far my favorite aspect and it's interesting to watch as your species progress (or regress).  It's a tad too long for my taste-when I play a two hour game I'll usually opt for something a bit meatier, but I'm glad I finally got to play it and I would like to give it a go from time to time.

RATING: 6
This game feels a lot like Dominant Species but MUCH more lightweight and with an auction mechanic instead of the worker placement.

Each round you score points based on the areas you control on a map.  The climate changes every round and the dinosaurs in the harshest climates die off.  Then at the end of a round genetic traits such as extra feet, horns, and fur are available for players to bid on and add to their species.

The thing that makes this a little more interesting are the power cards that let you break the rules to gain certain advantages.  Each player starts with 3 and doesn't draw more unless they get the "power card" gene.

It's a fine game but it is very light and there are simply more interesting area control and auction games out there.

Scales 3-5 well. [Dinosaurs] Luck reduction: Use n-1 genes for auction, No cards dealt at the beginning (or maybe 1 card face up), If the card gene is drawn from the bag, show the card face-up before starting to bid. Whoever wins keeps the card face up in front of them.

This game just might be one of the original Euro/AT hybrids - it manages to combine auctions, victory points, and other strategic Euro-style game elements with the aggression and killing of the Ameritrash camp!  So with everything that it has going for it, you'd think that the rules would be quite complex, wouldn't you.  Well you'd be wrong!  This is a remarkably simple game that can be taught and played by 4 first-time players in only a couple of hours, yet the time flies by and you find yourself wishing the game wasn't over yet (especially if you happened to finish in second place...).  And it's got freakin' DINOSAURS!!  Man, if I actually owned this game, the first thing I'd do is track down a bunch of little plastic dinos.  That would be freakin' awesome (I love my plastic toys)!  So to summarize, this game is simple, fun, pretty, and it's got dinosaurs.  You can't go wrong!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

RATING: 7
[Eurogames 2001 edition] {Evolution, dinosaurs; development, fighting, bidding, utility card, variable-player-order, dice-rolling} {7 if variant is used} Evo is an interesting family game. It is funny and cheerful - it's amusing to create a dinosaur with 5 legs! It is thematic with many mechanics: auction, fighting, weather, evolution, cards, etc. It has nice player interaction and can be confrontational. The evolution cards are quite random and some are really better than others.  It's slightly luck dependent due to dice rolls but players still have certain control.  Evo is not a great strategic game but it is still enjoyable to play.

I prefer the "1-fewer-gene" variant. It greatly enhances player interaction and the excitement of evolution and provides more tactics for the players though the game will be longer.

A superb blend of game mechanics that demands you anticipate well, get your dinosaurs to the right locations, evolve the right skills and outbid your opponent's in a uniquely vicious bidding mechanism that encourages you to ramp up the price of skills and pull out at the last minute to leave your opponent paying over the odds at no cost to yourself.

It's a perfect middle weight game with the right competitive group of people.

I don't know why I like this game so much but I do.  I love the bits.  I like the auction.  I like how the dinos are constantly shifting around to avoid getting frozen or fried.  I love the whimiscal theme.  The cards are perhaps a bit too random but you know what?  I don't care.  This is a great game to play with non-gamers.  Just be sure to VERY CAREFULLY explain how the climate works and then be prepared to explain it again.

A great dino game, tense bidding, its great fun stomping other players dinos, and of course the rush to head to safe areas can be very funny. I've started to feel having the initiative can be one of the most important factors in the game. It is a game where several strategies could be effective though. A game I'm looking forward top playing many more times

Dominant Species light.

Both a slightly unfair comparison and a very favorable one.

It is waaay faster than DS, covers a similar theme and has the same area control aspects.

It is also a lot lighter and there is a lot less going on.

For me, it scratches the same itch in about 1/3 of the time. For me, it makes Evo the winner.

This game is alright, and it's easy enough to play and teach.  It's fun.  I don't like the 'advanced' rules as they seem too harsh and add like an extra hour to the game which is way past it's likability stage.  I wish there was a between type of stage between normal and cutthroat.  I think that would be better as normal is too easy and cutthroat is too frustrating.

I like Evo, and always have.  The way the board changes size depending on the number of players means that there's never enough room for everyone, and yet there's just enough room such that if players really, really don't want conflict, they can usually avoid it.  Everyone likes taking the little gene chits and decorating their dinosaurs with them, ending up with legs in odd places, horns in places that would make it difficult to lie down (or, um, do other things), and it makes the game accessible to non-gamers.  I'm not a big fan of the "X-1" gene variant, as this is a game that, with hardcore gamers, I'd play something else, and with non-gamers, it's too cutthroat a variant...but regardless, Evo is fun.

This is a very fun dinosaur game where the players evolve their dinos to be better at reproduction and survival in the hot and cold climates and in fighting.  The only caveat here is that the cards seem like they are a bit unbalanced, and when bidding on an action card, the players don't know which card will be coming up.  I love the hopscotch bidding.

It's a surprisingly competitive and challenging strategy game for such a cutesy aesthetic.  There's a whole lot to think about.

Silly graphics and a goofy sense of humor may put some people off this game, but I really like the play and find the artwork and humor to be amusing and not a distraction. The humor is definitely not the only draw here, as players compete to control space in an ever-changing environment while they and their opponents gain individual skills and abilities.

Seems to run long for what it is, but this might speed up with more play with a consistent group.

Another pre-BGG board game.  I love the scaleable board, and the game always seems to get cramped at just the right time.

Ok I had 2 recent replays of this game.  I'm liking it a bit more now.  It has some decent strategy to it, and there are a couple alternative ways to do the auction part so one of them's going to work for the group.

RATING: N/A
As is typical with auction games, my first game was frustrating because I had a hard time valuing items.  We also played with the variant that provides one less gene than players each round, which the other players also felt detracted from the game.  All that said, it was an intriguing little game that I'd like to try again.

RATING: 4
Cute fun game.  I think movement is hugely important and horns might be a bit over powered but they were trying to keep things simple.  Winning a card should allow you to draw 2 cards and pick the better of them and discard the other.  In my case I had plenty of furs but got the card that protected me from freezing in a cold zone.  Useless for my bid. 

UPDATE: After a lot of plays of this I can say that my rating declines further. There's a phenomenon here on BGG that when a game goes OOP to up your rating and people clamor for it  even more. Nah, that's never been me. This one is losing it's luster for me. the horns/feet combo is just too powerful.

I really like the pureness of the bidding. With gamers, I'd probably play with the no-gene option, except that you have to realize that that will inflate (perhaps quite a bit) the bids on the first few rounds of genes, because you have to estimate how many Dinos that gene is going to save you over 10 rounds!

Evo is an interesting game that I want to like.  It wants to be a light version of Dominant Species.

Evo seems to have interesting decisions to make, about how many "mutation points" to bid on evolutionary advantages, where to migrate, where to spawn, etc.  The problem is that the game is just chock full of random die rolls that can hugely impact the game.  All in all it's just too random for me to really enjoy it.

217,453,883 years, seven months and 26 days before our time, the first dinosaurs left their home in the sea and climbed onto the land. The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!
In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term "dominant species". At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.
Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival – but don't spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner.
With every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth. When the meteor strikes (determined partly by dice), the game ends!

Lots of things to think about as you 'arm' your dino with evolutionary adaptations and hope the climate doesn't shift too suddenly.  Perhaps prone to KB-like swings of fortune (and runaway leaders) as the cards really manipulate the conditions.  Sadly, horns seem more useful as deterrents than as weapons of aggression: indeed, defense feels more effective than offense.

This might not always be a problem, but our game had a real rich-get-richer problem.  The event cards can certainly be nasty, but it can be hard to specifically target the leader with most of them.  Even if they do hurt the leader most, they are likely to take another unrelated victim with them.  Also, there were at least a couple times that the other players tried to fight me in the bidding, but by that time I wasn't desperate for anything, so their efforts just cost them victory points and I was reasonably happy with a free item and an increased relative point lead.  The game also seemed to be a little long for what it was, but that might have been because once I was well established, there just wasn't much for me to do.

I do like the general concept of the game, although the parasols should have been tough skin or something else.  The art is well done as well.  This might not have been a representative game, but I am not going to be clamoring to try it again.

I like this game-- the system is relatively straightforward but the auctions (esp. with one less gene than # of players) are interesting. It is important for other players to collaborate to reign in a burgeoning runaway leader, which usually can be accomplished with ease.  

I played the new (2011) edition and there are a couple minor changes although it is mostly the same game. I found the interface at first more confusing than the original but in a few turns I got used to it. Overall I'm not sure it's an improvement over the original but it wasn't markedly worse; worth picking up because it is easily available (and of course people will have their own preferences regarding the artwork).

Although the theme (dinosaurs) was appealing, I guess I'm just not silly enough to enjoy mutating dinosaurs in bizarre ways and, like most games with this element, I am horrible at figuring out what "genes" I need or want most. I also dislike games, such as this one, where you need to be in an optimal place and where there is the risk of losing pieces. I certainly hate the "N-1 Variant" of gene distribution, it significantly altered the game experience for me. Overall, I suppose this game is just too competitive for my taste. Great theme, but not my thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reasonable game, could do with a bit more action. As is, the conflict is mostly 'cutting off your opponents from the good spaces', and even that is more like playing Go than anything else. The gene bidding is okay, and the cards can give some extra advantages, but it's not a game I would opt to play very often. Once every few months, I'd say.

I really like the idea and the fixed game length, but the game does suffer a bit.  Some mutations are simply much more powerful (especially the "pay less" and egg-hatching ones).  The auction mechanic helps a bit, but it still sucks when you get outbid on the more important mutations.

Evo is a good game, there is certainly some randomness to it but I like the theme and light bidding.

I quite enjoy evolution as a game theme so this game is fun to me in that regard.  I also like that you bid with your victory points to get the mutations you want.  East light game with a lot of depth.

Not a bad game, but it is a bit slow and seems to end just when things are getting interesting. I prefer the n-1 gene variant, primarily because the meteor doesn&#039;t move for the first two turns...

Evo is a kick to play - strategies are varied and the auction phase is tight and tense.  I love this one.

12/2002 not played as yet. 01/2003 played first game not bad. put it up a notch. next time will play with one less gene variant. (hmmm...what was i thinking? when i came to my senses i realised this is one of my least played, least liked games)

Very much like a wargame. I should like it but I don’t. We always used the official variant where there is one less trait available than players. This feature where one person will not get anything is one of my least favorite systems.

RATING: 7
Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). A nice game with several clever ideas - and cute customizable dinosaurs. There is some randomness, both in the fights and the cards (some of them can be quite powerful), but the game is light enough so that it doesn't matter that much. I have played once or twice with the "hard auctions" variant (one less item) but do not really feel it is necessary, although it doesn't hurt either.

Clever auction component.  Fun on-the-board conflict.  Wacky dinosaur theme.  Enough randomness in the cards to keep things interesting.  A fun mixture.

Amusing game, but in the end the cards have such a big impact that all that brain-application seems for naught.

Странная игра. С моей точки зрения черезчур проста. Слишком мало действий требуется от игроков. Игра по большей части играет сама в себя

Awesome game with great bits. My students always have fun placing the various tiles that your dino evolves in awkward positions. Another game where there is no one 'best strategy' to follow. Would be a ten, except that it is very hard to catch up when you are behind.

RATING: 6.7
Not bad, rating could go up a little. Wouldn't mind playing on occasion but it's too light and random to get a ton of plays I think.

Played again with three and it was better than I remembered. Didn't seem as random and the components in the new edition are pretty good. The art is definitely a step up while the player mats are a bit too big and thin for me. The problem is when I think about this game, I don't really get any positive memories or even really remember how it works. Forgettable for me.

RATING: 6.5
Some good ideas here, but the pacing of the game is a bit off, and I'd have preferred if combat didn't come down to a single die roll. The action cards are also somewhat unnecessary... I think it would be a better game if there were one or two other adaptations to get that would expand a player's tactical options, rather than the cards.

RATING: 8
This has become my go-to "gateway" auction game. A very fun theme. Perhaps a "next step" gateway after the likes of Ticket to ride or Stone Age. And I MUCH prefer the first edition with its cartoon graphics and simpler climate marker.

RATING: 7
This is what Primordial Soup should've been.  The auction mechanic is excellent, giving cheap players (like myself or Armadi) one option, bigger spenders another, and also allows either to bluff and force someone to overpay.  The meteor creeping closer and closer is great.  And having a one-legged dinosaur with a parasol is just good clean fun.

What a game! Scales well, lots of tough decisions, clear rules, and a load of fun. A fairly light game that can help introduce more complicated mechanics (bidding, in particular) to novice gamers. Love it. [UPDATE] My rating drops down to a 6.5 or so if using the X-1 variant where 1 fewer gene is drawn than players. It punishes the last player in the turn order too severely based on pure luck of initiative -- which is a greater sin in my book than allowing one player to play catch up by snagging a free gene. If one player loses initiative several turns in a row early in the game, the X-1 variant can quickly eliminate them from contention.

It's fun.  I like the combination of the auction mechanic and the wargame aspects.  Not worth playing too much, but it's great breaking it out once and awhile.

A fun, humorous game about evolving your dinosaurs to survive.  I like the humor in the game (portraid in the cards), and the game itself plays well.  You have to watch what your opponents are doing with thier genes, as some combinations of genes get too powerful (lots of legs with lots of horns, for example).  Some of the cards can be a bit over-powering, though, and once you get behind by a certain amount, it is almost impossible to catch up.

Really nice evolution game.  The cards add just the right amount of chaos.

RATING: 7
Fun game with a nice theme and the play mechanic is good.  The only problem with this game (why it is not ranked higher) is that it inevitably devolves into a battle of horns and becomes rancorous.

Simple yet good little game. I can play this with the family. I like the climate system, cards are quite cool too. A bit too competitive maybe for playing this with young children like mine.

I like the board movement in this one... particularly that you don't have to attack someone to cause them trouble... just get in their way when the climate changes.  The mutations felt nicely random which would make one particular path hard to follow (unlike its thematic relative Primordial Soup) and it uses my favorite auction mechanic!  The fur/umbrella interacting with the climates seems to really confuse some folks, but once you get your head around that you have a fun, different game on your hands that I quite enjoy.

RATING: 6
Nice theme tied together by a hodgepodge of mechanics, some worked and others didn't.  The dynamic between the seasonal changes, the climate your tokens are on as well as how evolved they are to determine their ability to survive is an interesting one.  However, I did not care for the action cards, the combat nor the auction for the evolutionary advances.  None of the above were implemented well and I would go as far to say that they made the game worse.  It isn't all bad but the unpleasant elements stood out enough to make me reconsider my desire to play Evo again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I obviously rate this higher than most people. I can only say that I'm very impressed with bidding on items that actually matter in game play, as opposed to something that is of point value. This isn't the only game to do this, but it's always led to a fun game for me and those I've played with.

Evo does a great job of fitting mechanics to environmental pressures such as climate change and interspecies competition...except for the parasols.

After learning [thing=107255][/thing], I wanted to share it with folks I thought would dig it. Well, [guild=142]CABS[/guild] doesn't have the second edition, so we went with the first, and still had fun. I definitely prefer the enhancements added in the second, although the first has some of its own charms.

A great and clever design. It all comes down to simple rules and meaningful heavy decisions. Some luck elements that you can or can't take - Even for such a long game (the Eurogamer in me speaking ;) ) I have absolutely no problem with those dice rolls every now and then.

A solid game built around the mechanic of bidding for parts to upgrade your dinosaur.  Very little luck involved which tilts the game towards experienced gamers.  Enjoyment does not quite match the length of play.

This one is a winner! I like the way the dinos evolve and thus you have variable player powers. Superb!

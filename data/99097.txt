RATING: 5
The theme and artwork are great. The game really seems like it has potential to be a  lot of fun. Though the depth of gameplay is not super deep and there are a few rules we felt were a bit strange. For example for ties it seemed to just be a random luck of the draw to determine the winner. Though, ultimately it was a good experience. However, if I was playing with more hard-core gamers they might have got bored.

First of all I have to say how fun the booth set up was at Gen Con. I had a demo of this and I was sold.

There was a comment about this game being like War, which actually was said by the person who did our demo. I really think that was a loose comparison as highest number wins the serving. 

There are elements of strategy to this that adds a lot of fun, from the instant cards to drafting. The cards are well balanced. Only a couple of hands out of four games did I feel I had a craptastic hand and even with that, I won one of them. 

I know my soon to be 10 year old will love this although it is recommended for 13 or 14 plus. The art is fun, he'd pick up on the strategy. I will however not use the promos as they are a little bit...well...more adult. 

Kudos Cryptozoic for a fun little gem of a game!

Just a flat out no. You set up a well thought out plan in your head for attack and then it's all thrown away by shuffling and playing the cards in whatever order they come up. The card-gamer in our group decided to pack this one up himself to bury it with the other undesirables in our collection.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 3 players:

I actually really dig the drafting mechanic being used for a directly competitive combat game - and the multiple battlefronts infuse it with just the right amount of necessary uncertainty. It's surprisingly clever.

What isn't so clever however is that you shuffle your deck before playing. I get that they want you to account for luck of the draw as part of your strategy, but the luck still ends up feeling overpowering for me.

Still, I can see myself playing this now and again. You can certainly do worse!

Food fight is a wonderful idea, but games played with the beginner rules seem really luck dependant. It might be very different with the draft mechanic, but until then, I'll rate it on the lower end. 

I tried a quick three player game with the drafting mechanic. And it certainly played a lot better, with some very close fights, but I think it's a more the merrier sort of game as well.

A fair game, certainly good art work and a fun theme. I feel that the need to have separate fights for each opponent at a different meal can slow the game down and make it feel too dis jointed.

A party Card game with lots of interaction.  

Depending on the number of players, 2 to 3 meals arrive for the day.  The food fight starts over  breakfast (if it arrives), then lunch, and finally dinner by throwing down such foods as Private Soup, General Donut, Ketchup Mechanic.   Winner collects the meal.

The Boot Camp game, the recommended first game, is based on luck of the draw.  From then on the rules suggest you do card drafting, such as in 7 Wonders where you pick a card and everyone passes their hand to the next player, to choose again, etc.  That removes some of the luck and allows a person to attempt to develop a fight for a particular meal.

I found it very clever that sometimes you have to fight a ferocious dog over the food.  Also clever are the mint candies opponents earn during fights.  

With 6 players there is lots and lots of downtime.  There might be 3 fights in a day (round)  and the game can last for many days/rounds.  Players join in only one fight per day/round, and the round can last a long time.  In fact two players entertained themselves during a lull with a food fight with the mints.  

The Boot Camp version is the only one I played, and just isn't my kind of game.  I suspect the drafting version will only raise my poor rating slightly.

This is a clever drafting game that is quite comically themed.  Game play can be clunky at times. The cards do not seem incredibly balanced.  Long games can sometimes resort to a random draw of a card with the winner being the person who drew the highest numbered card.  Still fun to crack this one out every now and then.

This game has excellent and simutaneously hillarious art work that hearkens back to the awesome happy meal toys from the late 80s/ early 90s.

My geek radar went off on this one, so I avoided it most of the con.  The artwork was great and the booth was, too, but the game looked dumb.  When I tried it, I discovered - quite to my horror - that I was right to avoid it previously.  This was BY FAR the worst game I played at GenCon.  It's like the bastard child of Munchkin and War with some more randomness thrown in for good measure.  This partial demo could not end soon enough.

Not a bad game at all.  The core concept of the game is drafting cards to create the hand you will take into a battle.  the draft is a standard clockwise booster draft.  Battles play much like the classic children's card game War but with several interesting combos possible.  

This game would have earned a higher rating were it not for one problematic rule: if two players are tied for a victory point card, they cut the "dog" deck and high card wins the points.  After drafting my hand and playing my instants and combos to the best of my worth, to have the points decided by a blind draw was disappointing. Why not simply award the points to both players?

Video Review: https://youtu.be/_8cehbmzAgA

Food Fight is a game about fighting food. You draft your army and then choose your meal/battleground. Different foods perform better at different meals, plus there are randomly determined victory points for each meal. If you don't select the same meal as anyone else you fight the dog, which is ok but not the best resolution.

Overall I enjoy the game but it takes too long and is to hard to explain to newcomers.

This game alternates short rounds of drafting with short rounds of combat to great effect.

I own the IOS version of this game. It counts as a hybrid game in my opinion. The core is essentially an Euro game where it is a race to the finish when a player reach that much VP the game ends. It has card drafting mechanics in there with simultaneous selection mechanics to score the fights. It's pretty Euro up until this point. Then they added in some ATness by introducing random order of using your cards to fight and special abilities on the cards that matches the food theme. Not my cup of tea. Glad I own the IOS version instead of a physical copy.

I played this card games a couple times and wrote it off as too random and kind of a mess. I've recently played the digital version and it's let me explore the game a bit, there are three parts to this game, drafting, plating (deciding what cards to play) and meals (victory point cards you'll be playing war for). The game design is actually really clever, and the drafting/plating works great and the IDEA of just resolving things over a short game of war (a la Slapshot) sounds good. The problem is how swingy the game is. It's not uncommon for scores to be 5-1-0-0 after one round. in a game where you play until 10 this is too wild. Even worse, though less likely it could be 7-0-0-0. 

The Problem is you randomly flip three VP cards off a deck that represent one of the three meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) and send your plate there. However if you flip 2 or 3 of the same meal, the points get pooled and you could be fighting for up to 9.

This is really too bad because EVERYTHING about this game aside from the scoring system is kind of cool, but the scoring system just ruins the whole thing.

Mechanics: 9/10

Pieces: A handful

I can tell you right now, if you want to inject 300% more fun into this game you should narrate it with funny voices for the characters.

The box art is 80% the reason I got FF. Most of the games I typically play have super cute, story teller type art, so I really dig the old gritty retro comic book style this game is illustrated in. Because of the limited number of pieces, I thought they should have put a bit more creativity into the scoring chips. Rather than peppermints, they should have made medals or perhaps chocolate chips (pun on scoring chips, geeet it?) 


The mechanics are moderately simple, though the rules aren't written as clearly as they could be. The first play through we would accidentally use troops that weren't technically on the field for their effects and other small stuff, but that didn't kill it for us. I see many more plays of this game in the future and will definitely buy the expansion

A sort of multiplayer Battle Line mixed with drafting.  Players draft cards to battle at 1-3 locations.  Your army is created from what you draft and then shuffled.  In my opinion, this is where the game loses its luster.  When you randomize the army, you lose all semblance of control.

It's a fine game and I'd play it again, but it could be better.

DO NOT play this without drafting. It's quite pointless that way.

Thrift store find.  Haven't found anyone to play this with yet.  Art is fun, reminiscent of 80's garbage pail kids and obviously a lot of thought has gone into it's creation.  Fun characters.

Saw this at Gencon 2011, didn't buy it.  Picked it up afterwards, not a game I go for often anymore.  It's entertaining but not a game I see lasting long on the game shelf.

Played the version on iOS first and liked it.  Got the card game when it was on sale for Black Friday.

Must play with players selecting their army's play order before the "meal" instead of shuffling their army.

Much like Slapshot with drafting and lots more chaos. And you only use a set of cards once. It ends up taking far, far too much time for the limited amusement value it offers.

Still surprised Mattel hasn't sued Crypto for the similarity between this game and their 1988 toyline "Food Fighters" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Fighters

I guess they enjoy it as much as I do. Great, simple learn. Goes in the camping trip box with Gloom, Citadels, and Guillotine. Expansion is worth picking up.

It's interesting, and the art and puns are pretty amusing, but the gameplay tends to get old fast.

takes some getting used to; a lot of card drafting followed by battles as a result; very imaginative and thematic artwork with the feel of a 50's style diner menu art;  this game grew on me the longer that I played it; I definitely like it as a meaty filler

I really like this one. It gets frustrating sometimes when it seems like your perfect cards get shot down over and over, but that's the luck of the draw. The artwork and humor are fantastic.

Basically boils down to the cardgame 'War,' with some light strategy thrown in. Very cool art and theme, just wish that more game was attached to it.

Easily one of the worst games I've ever played.

As with Epic Spell Wars, Crytpozoic somehow makes a braindead simple game very hard to understand with their awful rulebooks that have more flavor than information, so I had to go online and watch a half hour video of them playing the game to get a grasp of basic rules that are left out (fortunately, even though the game they played was entirely scripted, they covered what we needed). So, already frustrated going into this one after not even finishing a single meal when going in "blind" (with only, you know, the rulebook).

Night 2. We get a 4 man group going and I have to explain how we're supposed to play 2 games - "Bootcamp", where everyone is dealt 9 random cards, and then "Draft". So, I have to explain two sets of rules, why we're doing it the way we're doing it, and play a faux round that no one cares about before switching to the new rules. I'm actually embarrassed having to explain this silly process. Great.

As with the first game I tried to play (which didn't make it past bootcamp due to bad hands and rules confusion), "Bootcamp" goes horrible because someone gets a bad hand with almost no troops and bad instants (the first bootcamp game I tried, someone got a hand with 2 troops - which makes the entire round unwinnable for them). We try and quickly finish and get into the "Draft" mode, how the game is supposed to be played.

Drafting. Sucks. When you're drafting cards for an MTG tournament that lasts a couple hours, sure, draft to your hearts content! When you're drafting cards for a round that takes a couple of minutes, and then discarding everything and drafting all over for the next round - it's the biggest chore ever. We drafted twice and that was enough for everyone. Did not finish a real game.

The game promotes making fun food combos, but then screws you out of them by making you shuffle your troops. Every single player had made their troops how they wanted and were disappointed when I said they had to shuffle them. Every. One. Playtest much, Cryptozoic? There's even a card that lets you assemble the troops you want, so the thought was there, but there's only one of them in the giant stack of cards so good luck ever seeing it.

The actual food fighting can be fun. Players tend to blow all their instants on the first serving however, which leaves the rest of the servings pretty bland. There are some cases (especially when 3+ players fight over a serving) where it can actually become a touch strategic - i.e., one player could play an instant to become competitive, but is so far behind another player he would rather keep it for next serving. But these little morsels of strategy between all the randomization and drafting and stuff are just so few and far between. What were the designers thinking?

To make matters worse (is it possible?) the card quality is atrocious. It almost seems like a mistake. The cards feel like uncoated cardboard, almost a construction paper quality, that came stuck together in the box. I actually had to pull cards apart and hope the paint didn't come off.

Since last playing, I thought that maybe this game would go a bit more smoothly with drafting 3 cards a round instead of 1 (reducing the number of hands passed down from 9 to 3), but I don't even really want to ever play it again anyway. Oh well.

The art is great, and the names of cards and their interactions are clever (aside from the mascot instants, those are kind of out of place). It's just that everything else is terrible.

But hey, at least Cryptozoic included the useless stand-up sign we can put on the table and stare at while waiting for drafts or other players to fight over their meal.

Excellent game with a hilarious sense of humor.  Really looking forward to seeing some expansions of this.  The artwork and flavor is high quality, and the game is quick and easy to learn, but fun to play.

Still sitting on the fence about this one. I need to play 3 more rounds to at least give it a rating.

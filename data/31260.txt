I'm awed by the mechanics and the sheer number of things you have to keep track of while managing your farm. Speaking of which: The theme is anything but pasted on - it's reflected in the gameplay very well.

RATING: 4
Played once.  I enjoyed it, but didn't find it that exciting.  More plays needed.
Update: Played again. More exciting but less enjoyable. I've read that a lot of people just like the aspect of building their own farm.  I don't feel like that myself, but maybe that is me being competitive.  I find the victory points have to be considered, which puts a lot of pressure on in terms of: food, fences, family members, animals, vegetables, house construction.
Theres a lot to the game and I find it pretty overwhelming.  Hopefully it will get easier.
Update: Played for the 3rd time, this time with cards.  I've got to say I just don't enjoy this game. I came 2nd on a 5 player game so I've mostly 'got it' now, but I think I find having too much choice a bit too stressful and I'm too competitive to just enjoy building my own farm. Downgraded to a 5.

Update: I think I just don't enjoy heavy euros. Where is the fun? Downgraded to a 4.

RATING: 8
Not the gaming nirvana the rankings would have you believe but still very good. the core game is very tough and would be worth an 8 on it's own but all those cards create great variety and bump it up to a 9. I'm going to mark it down one though because I really am terrible at it and, as a consequence don't enjoy it quite as much as I could do.

RATING: 9
I have been playing this solo for the most part, and after about 10 solo games, I have decided that I only want to play this with other people. The cards don't offer enough variety to significantly change the game for me.  It has become boring and repetitive.

I am glad my husband is slowly beginning to like this game better (after he won a couple of games).  Introducing the complex cards was a good idea.  Even my 6 y.o. didn't feel that the easy deck really added to the game, but the complex deck does begin to make things interesting.

Update Nov 27, 2010 - Downgraded from 8 to 7 since it seems like I never want to play this game. Agricola is a brilliant game, but requires too much planning ahead. I am usually not in the mood for it.

Update Dec 11, 2010 - Upgraded back to 8 after a play with 4 people.

My favorite game ever! Many friends of mine say they prefer to play it without cards. In my opinion, cards make it richer, thougher and more variable. I think I'll never stop playing it.

RATING: 5.6
Initially liked it but the more times I play it the more I feel that the punishing nature of the game hinders it from being fun. I used to get excited about the multiple slight "engine-building" possibilities, but if I spend the entire game trying not to starve to death I can't explore the part of the game that seems fun.

RATING: 9
This game instantly became one of my favourite boardgames of all time the first time I played it - and has continued to get better and better.

I found the instructions extremely complicated, considering the game is actually very easy to play. It is very challenging and has great depth, whilst remaining fairly simple.

Definately recommended.

RATING: 9
I remember the first time I played this my brain was overwhelmed, I had no idea what was going on, and came in last place. As in, very last place.

But after a few plays it really grew on me. This is one of my very favorite games, and by far my favorite "Euro" worker placement.

UPDATE 8-15-14: Bumped down a bit to an 8.5. It is still one of my favorites, but it just does not hit the table as much as it used to as we have so many other games that we would rather play.

UPDATED 10-10-14: Played it again recently and bumped it up to a 9. What can I say, I still really like it.

RATING: 7
Might have been the first worker placement I played, and still one of the best. For me the threat of the wrong decisions potentially making you crash and burn rather than merely 'do less well' makes the game far more tense and exciting than you'd expect. Not to everyone's tastes, but it sure appeals to mine.

update 22/06/2016: as I've played more and more fresh takes on Euro mechanics my desire to play this has dropped somewhat. Still a classic, but no longer in my personal upper echelons.

I've been holding out for a year and a half before allowing anything to be as good as chess despite playing excellent game after excellent game thanks to recommendations on the geek but Agricola has cracked my resolve. Simply superb. Fast but filled with tough decisions. Only played with two and it has a perfect level of player interaction. No two games are the same. Complex where it needs to be and simple where it needs to be. It may take a while but it is destined to be number one. Congratulations to all concerned. It's a masterpiece.

I have only recently discovered my love for Agricola. I have played Caverna before Agricola, so I had never strived to try the older brother, but when I tried it, I have realized that cards really do make all the difference. I love games in which you do not have enough time to do everything you want, so optimising and careful planning are the key. The theme is freaking gorgeous - I really do feel like I am a poor farmer fighting for his life :D

A true classic.

RATING: 10
Very thematic worker placement game, with excellent scalability and good variability, about building the best farm.

It's hard to believe that such a strategic "gamer's game" could be so accessible to the average non-gamer, and that it's designed by Uwe Rosenberg of all people (of Bohnanza fame).  This is a game that once played, people want to immediately play it again.  Despite the fact that the main mechanism is worker placement, which is getting overly tired these days, the game still feels fresh, as it has a very unique and strong theme.  Plus the huge amount of cards (occupation, which add special abilities/skills, and minor improvements, which again add special abilities) adds variability.  It should be noted that the cards are not nearly as crucial to gameplay as one would think.  I have bitched and moaned practically every game I've played about my terrible starting hand, and won most of those games without the need to play hardly any cards (although I would hope that having and playing a lot of strong cards is a viable strategy- edit: it is, as I've even won by playing a lot of crap cards).

The components are very good (particularly if you have the animeeples, which I do), the scalability is excellent, and the game, while lasting 14 rounds, goes by very quickly and gives you a lot to think about during and after the completion of the game.  It's all about balance, balance, balance, as points are awarded (or deducted) for essentially every possible category in the game (3 different animal types, vegetables, grain, pastures, fields, stables, family members, filled/empty spaces, buildings, cards, etc.).

If ever a "gamer's game" is to become mainstream, and break through to the masses, this is that game.  I've recently noticed this for sale at Indigo/Chapters, which is a real positive sign (they've expanded their zone beyond Settlers and Carcassonne).  Edit: Agricola is long gone from those shelves, looks like the herd weren't up to the challenge after all, too bad.  Anyways, this game is definitely deserving of it's overall #1 ranking here on BGG!

Only played one game thus far, but my current thoughts:

The good:  interesting strategy game, good play dynamics, fairly original theme, fun to build up your own farm, quick play time, different strategies

The negative:  way too complex, incomprehensible rules, initial time investment to learn, too much luck (opening cards can have major effect on outcome), poor scoring system
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great two player game. I prefer to draft cards as I find random draw to leave too much up to chance in a game like this.
With more than two players I prefer the cardless variant because it cuts the playing time to something reasonable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
I enjoy the game, but two player games get too antagonistic for my taste.  I would rank this higher if my wife enjoyed this more, but I guess the bottom line is that we have several other games we often prefer playing to this one.

RATING: 8
Impressive game even in the cut-down "family" version, much better with the development cards. Plenty of strategic depth, and more opportunity for player interaction than I had been led to believe. The solo game is surprisingly engaging (I usually dislike solo games). A caveat however - it can be frustrating if you're dealt a poorly compatible hand of cards, or lots of travelling cards.

An enjoyable game with tons of replay value in the box. I cannot add to what has already been said about this title other than to state that it has become popular in our home among all ages -- 10 to adult (with the advanced rules, not the family rules).

The setup and readthrough of instructions when we played this game for the first time I think took most of an hour, if not more.  But complexity aside, it's a great game.  I've only ever played it two-player, and I both anticipate and dread how fast the choice of actions will disappear with more players.

I enjoy this game even if my wife enjoys it more than me. While somewhat complicated at first after a couple plays it starts to click and you start to really develop strategies.

Really complex game with a fresh theme. It just has not enough player interaction and that is why I prefer the Interactive Deck. But even in that variant, I can't really say that I woul suggest to play the game with my group. The theme would be perfect for non-gamers, but the mechanics are so dry that it is only suitable for experienced gamers.

Un euro bastante temático pero con un azar excesivo en el tema cartas. Lo bajé de nota en 2016 dado que el Caverna es un mejor juego en todos los sentidos, si no has jugado a ninguno de los dos y quieres darle una oportunidad a uno, prueba el Caverna, si tienes el agricola, cuando pruebes el caverna te darás cuenta de lo que digo.

It took me awhile to pinpoint what I didn't like about Agricola. I kept the rating at 10 because I didn't seem have a reasonable reason (heh) to lower it.
But when I got [thing=43018][/thing], I realized that the occupations seemed to be just added for good measure, besides being frightfully imbalanced (at least for two players, which means a lot to me).
With Farmers of the Moor (sans occupations), Agricola is one of my favorite games.

RATING: 9
Really enjoy Agricola, even though it's quite stressful at times.  It's fun to build your farm, and try to claim the worker actions you need before your opponents block you.

RATING: 8
After a long break, I finally decided to give this one another go-around.  Apparently, my tastes have changed as I had an enjoyable experience.  The main draw of the game appears to be the stress of not being able to complete everything by the end of the game.  If that doesn't sound fun to you, probably pass on Agricola.

My wife and I really enjoy it, but we're still working on getting the hang of it. I've heard it can be resource starved with only 2 players, and I would agree, though I haven't played it with more than 2 ever. On the other hand, it really makes you think about your strategy, and I do love it.

Everytime difficult and challenging.

Very complex very good!

Wanted to love this game, just don't feel like you get enough actions.  Really heavy on choices in this game.  Bad cards can hurt sometimes, also if you don't get a baby right away, you're not going to do as well.  He with the most babies wins most of the time.

Not much to say that has not been already said. Another masterpiece of game design. The number of people playing it and rating it in BGG give an idea of its success. The masses embraced it in joy.

After a few plays at BGG.con '07 I can safely say that the hype is totally justified! I haven't felt this way about a game since I discovered Settlers oh so long ago... my German copy is on it's way, and the Z-Man edition has been pre-ordered. I am officially obsessed!The game itself is wonderful... so many paths emerge from the card variance and the actions picked that it would be hard to see two games go the same way. I can't wait to immerse myself in this one! UPDATE: I have played solo, two-player, three-player, four-player and five-player. I have loved it all! Each iteration is a little different, which adds yet another great level to the game (resource availability, timing issues, etc). This game will end up being a 10 for me, I am sure. UPDATE: After 25 plays and still wanting to only play this game above all others, I am going to upgrade to a 10. This game is not perfect, but for me, it doesn't get much better.

Welcome to action-paralysis hell.

Great game if you have players who can plan contingencies for their contingent contingencies knowing exactly what they're going to do on their turn no matter how other players before them act. Otherwise just pop a bag of popcorn and watch some paint dry because that would be a more enjoyable and efficient use of your time. . .

Also, the rulebook for this edition could likely fall under the category of "crime against humanity", do yourself a favor and download the headless hollow summary and print one for all of your players.

I like the game, I'm not sure if I love it yet.  It definitely has last appeal.  Is it better than Puerto Rico?  Probably, but I don't think PR should be the #1 game anyway.

Only based on 1 play, looking forward to playing again.

Given my job as a property fund manager whose portfolio includes English farms this was always going to appeal. Well over 20 games played now and one of the most popular for our group in 2008. Brilliant game with tremendous theme. Very well balanced so that each of the main paths to victory has its own opportunity costs The only version I find slightly odd is the solo game, which is more of an efficency puzzle.

After 3 games, my impression is that Agricola is over-rated. The reactions I've gotten for this from my friends are weaker than games like Puerto Rico, Ysphahan and even Dominion received. Perhaps this game will reveal more depth with time - I am not really expecting it though. 

Update: up from a 7 to an 8. Ok, the game does have depth. Like a friend of mine pointed out, this is as close as we get to multi-player chess. He has a point. However, the other games referred to here are still more 'fun', imo.

Habe meine Meinung revidiert. Zuerst fand ich das Spiel nur schlecht, aber nun nach 3 weiteren Spielen, finde ich es immerhin so gut, dass ich behalten werde. Ich bin zwar immer noch der Meinung, das ich es schade finde, das am Ende die Runden zur Ernte immer kürzer werden (ich sehe auch keinen Sinn drin, wenn man schon etwas aufbaut, was der Realität entsprechen soll!), aber es hat mir nun trotzdem Spaß gemacht. Aber am besten spielt man es mit Karten, damit man am Ende wenigstens noch etwas machen kann, anosnsten ist es meist nur ein gegurke ums aufrüsten. Deshalb auch im Moment nur eine 7, aber auch das könnte höher werden. Großer Vorteil. Durch die Karten wird man nie immer und die gleiche Strategie fahren! Deshalb sollte der Langzeitspielspaß ungebremst sein.

Agricola is not a game for everyone, but it consistently offers up the most rewarding board-game experience I have encountered. It is a great couple's game, endlessly customisable, with plenty of variety to keep things interesting, and surprisingly accessible. Few other games offer up the same 3D, tactile experience of Agricola, and those that do, don't provide the same depth of gameplay. Agricola is a masterpiece of board-game design.

A very enjoyable game. It not only looks great with all those wooden animals but also feels great and plays great. What to wish more?

Excellent worker-placement game. A light yet generally enjoyable theme. Randomness under control (although occupations and minor improvements require drafting).

I'm seriously considering buying some veg-mepples to make the game look&feel even better.

I love this game!  It's about as good as it can get for me.  The game kicks your butt almost as much as your opponents can and I really enjoy when I have a good game where everything seems to be getting easier towards the end of the game.  I get a good sense of satisfaction that I did a good job as the end.

Lots of brain-taxing fun. The cards can be unbalanced, but despite that, it's still one of my favorites. 

I grew up on a farm and hated farming. One of my favorite board games is surprisingly...centered around farming.

One of my favourite games.  The family version is about a 7 for me, but with the Occupations and Minor Improvements, this is absolutely a 10.  I love the tension, theme and gameplay.  I love getting my 14 cards and figuring out how/when/if I will play them during the game.  I love building my farm.  I love how challenging the game is.  I just love this game!

I'm pleased with the results. To be sure, there are negatives. The rulebook is poor given the relative simplicity of play, the components sprawl all over the place when playing and makes for an intimidating experience, the number of cards feels completely over the top - like a movie with a large budget but no editor - and in general, there's nothing terribly novel about the mechanics.

On the up side, it has good pace (but plays long), flowed well and made sense. It does have a worthy depth to explore and I'd like to know it better. This game somehow "fits" well and plays smooth - great construction, not just in components, but in mechanics. The theme is cute and well integrated. My wife says she'd try it one more time and my daughter says she prefers Stone Age. Friends find it "alright" so far, but overly complicated (over powering by the number of components and cards) for what it is. As for me, I remain ready to play again. Something keeps drawing me back.

Éste es uno de los más afamados juegos de gestión de recursos. 
Tiene tanta variedad, que no te lo acabas, sobretodo por las cartas, aunque las sensaciones cada partida son similares. Recomendable a cualquier numero de jugadores, aunque contra más, el puteo indirecto se incrementa. 100% recomendable para cualquiera ya iniciado en el mundillo y guste de euros de gestión sin importar tanto la interacción. Versión en solitario para quien le atraiga. Entre el caverna y este... están ahí ahí...

Agricola is close to the ultimate worker placement. Competition over the best spots is fierce and you never quite get to accomplish everything you want in a game. The need to feed your family after each harvest puts pressure on you and creates a natural limit for growth. When the game first came out back in 2008, the theme was refreshing since there were not too many games about farming. To be honest, I was not too excited about the theme at first, and the initiation game was a sore multi hour experience of down time. But it did not take long before I embraced the game, and as of this writing (2017) I think the theme is pure gold.

The absolutely best part of the game are the occupation cards, since without them Agricola would be just another soulless worker placement game. The cards allow for a myriad of strategies and no two games play the same and I actually find the initial analysis of the cards the most fun part of the game. Your analysis gives you a long term plan to follow and helps with tactical choices. This is something I am always seeking after in all games, i.e., a balance between tactics and strategy. Agricola offers both.

To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones like Agricola.  If I only had more space to store my games...

2010-03-15
Truly a great game. There are so many ways to win and so many things to do. The different difficulty levels make this one of the most versatile titles out there. However, not worth a 10... maybe a little deeper story is required.

After a couple more plays, this is a solid 9. Great game, endless replayability, feels different every time (so far), interesting choices. I'm really liking this one.

=====================================================
Played for the first time, it felt like Roads and Boats done better. R&B had too much accounting for me  (and I'm pretty decent with math) and was too fiddly. Agricola is too, but to a lesser degree, and is also shorter making the fun/hour ratio much better in my opinion.
Rating is bound to go up with more playings.

One of the best worker-placement games ever. Gives a very nice feeling of actually accomplishing something, building your farm. The good old problem of eurogames, you want to do so much more, but you cannot and have to optimize everything. The cards add unlimited replayability. The expansion is very very good too.

Hmmm...scratches head...I enjoyed this game and can see why so many on the Geek rave about it.  It certainly a Gamer's Game par excellence.  In many ways it reminded me of an expanded Caylus.  It certainly seems less linear and more variable than Caylus, but the downside to that is that it's also longer and more difficult to get your head around at first.

But there are problems that mean I just can't rate this higher than a 7:  

1. It's one of those games where there is likely to be quite lot of downtime between your turns - and that's never a good thing.  
2.There is player interaction, but not quite enough for me.  
3.It's also maybe just a little bit too much of a calculation game.  That can also bog-down the game even more, and after a while, all that calculating numbers gets a bit dull.  I find myself desperate for something exciting to happen...instead one just keeps building the puzzle.
4. And this brings me on my main gripe - it's just not got as a high a "fun factor" as many other euros.  Yes, it's brain-burning, and brain-burning can be a major part of fun.  However, the other part of fun (excitement, unexpected interaction and edginess), is not there for me.
5. The rules are both poorly written and hard to grasp.

Having said all of that:
  
I like the heaviness of it and the theme is fine considering it's actually pretty abstract at base. 
It's also deep and variable and the artwork is great, though I think cubes for animals is irritating.

Overall, I really don't think it's worth all the hype it gets but it's certainly a solid 7.  To get more it needs magic and excitement.

And that's not to say that deep games can't have magic or excitement: to give one example off the top of my head -  El Grande is just as deep, but is also less mathematical and ultimately more fun and edgy.  

This may all come down to taste in the end and I guess I find this game good, but not compulsive.

Farming, anyone? Would you like to play a game about farming? ... Anyone?

I'd honestly rate this higher if I could get someone to play this with me more than once. It typically garners a lukewarm response: "It's ok, but I'd rather play game X..."

*Edited score Jan 2011: I bumped this up to a seven. I've had a few plays now, and it's growing on me.

Online Play.

This isn't one I would pick up a physical copy of. Unless you are in to midevil farming the theme is dry. You have 15 turns of building out your farm, stumbling over your opponent as you go for the same resources. 

I believe playing with the advanced cards makes it worse. They add complexity to a game where there is too much going on anyways.

I [i]love[/i] the tension that comes every round with the "will I get to play my action?" question. Such agony. Never enough time to accomplish all that needs to be done, which is also part of the fun. The variable appearance of the round actions and the seemingly infinite variety of the occupation/minor cards make this wonderfully replayable. Great fun. Add to this the fact that J is in absolute love with the game, and you have the perfect storm of awesome.

Yes, I gave this a six.  Having played it a couple times I realize that there's a lot more to this game than there appears to be at first.  The various decks, etc., offer a great deal of replay value.  But overall, I just don't think this game is really my cup of tea (or grain.)  I'll certainly play it again and I'm sure I'll have a good time of it, too.  But I know there are other games out there that I'll have a much better time playing.

RATING: 5
This is basically "just another euro" in my book. It got very good mechanics that makes the game flow nicely, so that part is ok. The quality of the game is great as well. The theme, however, is uninspiring and playing the game borders to boredom. It is more or less a solitaire game where you try to make the best of your card on your hand. The cards, however, contains a lot of text and it can be difficult to work out how to use them. If the cards are dealt randomly, then you can end up with a pretty bad hand that really wont offer you much chance. It definitely lacks the fun factor for me.

RATING: 8.45
Solid game sure to be appreciated by people who like heavier strategy games.  Less likely to be appreciated by people who feel that heavy thinking games feel more like homework than a game (particularly where suboptimal decisions can severely handicap a player for the entire game).  Several people who I regularly game with find this game to be too stressful (what?  My family is running out of food again??).  Excellent game for teaching the importance of engine-building.

Early mistakes can be brutal which, over time, tends to lead to fairly predictable early and mid-game play.  Fortunately there is a fair amount of variety with the minor improvements and occupation decks (with lots of unnecessary expansion decks in case you get bored with all the ones that come with the base game).  The luck element of drawing a better starting set of improvements and occupations can be mitigated through card drafting or other methods so that players are still more or less similarly situated at the beginning of play.

RATING: 6
Used to be my favorite game. Very deep with tons of variability keep it feeling strategic and fresh every time I play. I don't get enough opportunities to play with more than 2 people but I still thoroughly enjoy it. Of course every once in a while you have that round where you just go to the wrong way from that start and want to throw the game away from frustration...on the other hand you sometimes have the game where you see everything clearly right from the beginning and can build great combos of occupations and improvements...I guess I have a love - hate relationship with this one.

The default resource management game that others are compared to.  Probably overrated and has its share of weaknesses such as learning curve, the importance of the first few turns, weakish theme and analysis paralysis (although many other strategy and resource management games share these criticisms).  Agricola scores highly though due to the family and solo variants included in the box and due to its wide appeal.  The new animeeples are a big plus as well.

The imbalance between players of cards drawn is an issue for me, even when playing a card draft, one player can still have a great set of cards to win from the start. 

Maybe there needs to be an auction to buy them, everyone likes auctions.

Have gone off this recently, maybe I overplayed it or got everything I wanted from the system, maybe I will come back to it after burning out on some other games

Update: Playing this at LoB competitions really helped pick this back up. Banning the overpowered cards and playing with the E, I & K decks mixed together adds a huge amount of potential to the game. Plus I've got a lot better at it to spot more good cards and combos; it's now one of my most played and treasured games.

RATING: 6
So I am getting this game, the highest-rated of them all. And it has a theme of farming, which is appealing to my whole family. So I was all excited when I bought this game, for the steep price of seventy bucks. 
My disappointment started when I unpacked this game. No nicely designed landscape and pieces, as I would expect from an upscale game. But just boring game plans for placing the action cards. It wasn't even obvious which side was the front or the back. One of the plans has even to be turned around during the game, totally unnecessary. The farms: just boring green rectangles. And the resources are just round and square color coded wooden blocks. And then hundreds of game cards, nicely designed, but when you start up you only play with a few of them. And it turns out that their design isn't so great after all, as important information is so small printed that they are hard to read even for people who do not wear glasses.
Well, I shrugged this off and started studying the rules. Oh what a mess these are! Confusing and full of errors. Example drawings are rare and not aligned with the text. So now you start looking for the drawings and assign them to the rule text. 
The rules of this game are very complex. I have no problem with that, if the rule book help you mastering these. But where is the rule "My first game"? Agricola has such a rule, called the "family game". But in order to play this game you have to work yourself through the whole complexity of rules only to learn what you can leave away. Why not explain the base game first and then add all the rest as advanced options? This would makes way more sense.
Summary: I got extremely frustrated when studying the rules (for 2 hours). And my coplayers got VERY bored when I explained the rules to them.
But then the surprise for everyone: The game itself wasn't bad at all, and this is the reason why it gets an ok rating. The game mechanics are really good and allow the application of strategies. It was actually fun to build up the farm. But without studying the scoring rules, it is easy to apply wrong tactics that make your farm look good, but still make you loose the game. 

Is this the best boardgame of all times, as the rating implies? No! By far not! Not even close! I don't think it is even worth the 70 bucks that I payed for it. But it is ok fun, and I will play it again.

How bad is Agricola?  Well, it's not as bad as [thing=483][/thing], which is why this is not a "1" rating.  You may say, "Hey, this game isn't broken."  Yes it is, and I'll tell you why.

When I got back into gaming around 2009, I was exposed to Eurogames.  I was an old school wargamer, but with 25+ years of no wargaming, my senses were dull and I fell for the trap of Eurogames and was trapped in a cold & dull prison of my own making.  I heard grumblings about a "lack of theme" and "multi-player solitaire" but what the heck did that mean?  Can't you see that Ticket to Ride is about trains, Pandemic is about saving the world, Power Grid is about creating electricity and San Juan is about -- um -- buildings?  Yeah... buildings.

I had yet to play any of the revered "top 10" on BGG, and then a well-intentioned soul invited me to play Agricola.  Oh goodie, the #2 ranked game.  This is going to be awesome sauce.

So what happened?  I woke up.  I had been under the spell of Wormtongue who was telling me Euros are elegant, beautiful, and deep.  But while playing Agricola, I suddenly understood what "themeless abomination" meant.  This game has as much to do with farming as Nexus Ops does with ballet.  It was a 2+ hour exercise in boredom and I was trying to build my "farm" better than everybody else, and build it myself.  Come on, the Amish help each other raise barns!  They even know multi-player solitaire sucks!  

As I was "playing" ("suffering" is more accurate, because "play" infers I was having fun), I was actually thinking, "You know, if the Rapture happened now, I wouldn't have to finish this horrible game and nobody would hate me for cutting out on it."  I frequently pinched myself hoping to wake up.  The words "Calgon: take me away!" were uttered under my breath.  I even subtly pulled out my wallet, flipped it open, leaned over discreetly and said, "Scotty, beam me up" hoping against all hope that it would actually work!  

Since none of that worked, I was at least hoping that one of the event thingies that come up would have unleashed a dinosaur across someone's farm.  THAT would have been really cool and might have saved this bore-fest.

This game actually has the unique ability to move your entire gaming table at near-light speed, because time slows to a crawl as you suffer through it.  It may have only been 2 hours, but it felt like 2 centuries.  Poke an icepick through my head and put me out of my misery!

When it was over, I was happy.  They summed up the victory points and I won -- not because I had the most (I promise you, I did not), but because I was spared the continuing torture of this game, and unlike the poor saps at the table, I would never have to play this again.  This game tried everything to break me, but I overcame!

"Yeah, but it's not broken!" you're saying.  Well, remember all of those Euros that I liked?  After that, I hopped in my car, drove home, got on BGG, and lowered the rating of [u]every single one of them[/u]!  Like sunlight through a magnifying glass, I suddenly understood what [i]multi-player solitaire[/i] and [i]themeless[/i] meant, and I saw Euros for what they are.  This game is so broken that it broke an entire genre for me!  How's [b]that[/b] for broken?  

Now that Wormtongue's spell was broken, I rose and embraced the glorious wargames of my youth and their distant cousin, Ameritrash.   So if not for Agricola, I would still be one of those poor unfortunate souls pushing a wooden rectangle (pretending it's a train) across Neverland and moving cubes from hither and yon ... or as my buddy says, try to be the grand poo-bah of latrine inspection, or whatever lame-brained "theme" these Euros come up with.  I would be one of those unfortunate souls pretending boredom is "elegant" and BGG rankings actually mean something.  So in a sense, those 2 hours of boredom and torture served a greater purpose of personal emancipation.

Hard to master: a lot of strategic thinking and planning ahead is necessary. Can be quite long if there a players how need time for their turn.
The game often feels too short at the end: now I got everything I need but there is no more round left!

Player: 2-5 (best: 2-4)
Time: 45m per player

RATING: 7
A good game whose theme of a medieval farmer of tending a farm and worry of feeding the family really comes out and one does get some pride at the end of the game, depending on the state of your farm/player board. Strategy is also in the game with a lot of pre planning involved. Downside is once you got certain occupation or improvements, you are steered towards a certain strategy to win.

RATING: 8
An 8 rating by BGG's scale is a very good description of my feeling for this game.  I want to play it and will play it with little prompting, but it must compete for my attention against other games.  At least for our first few plays, it leaves us with a desire to do better next time, which is an encouraging sign for long-time enjoyment.

I also find the game goes over well with non-gamer friends.

Fantastic game, Great pace as tension builds toward the end to get everything done.  I like the concept of building a strategy around a random hand of cards, but my only gripe is that not all cards are equal and some of the stronger ones imbalance the game.

Una especie de "Sim City" en una granja...
Es un buen sucesor de Puerto Rico. Componentes geniales, dos modos de juego (básico y avanzado), una gran rejugabilidad con los mazos y expansiones disponibles, e incluso el tema parece no estar tan pegado como en otros Eurogames (realmente sufrirás cuando la cosecha vaya mal a tu familia de granjeros y tengas que matar el único corderito que queda para poder alimentarlos..). Además el juego funciona bien para 2 y 1 jugador (tiene un modo en solitario).
Muy adictivo.

Think on "Sim City" on a farm...
A good sucessor to Puerto Rico. Great components, both basic and advanced play modes, great replayability with all the available decks and expansions, and even the theme seems to be not so pasted as in other euros (you really will suffer for your farmers family, when it has been a bad harvest and you have to kill your only little cow to feed them..). Also, it plays well with 2 and 1 players (it has a solo mode).
Absolutely addictive.

RATING: 8
Great game!  Worker placement for food, resources (including animeeples, cubic or non-geometrical) and actions, a small construction aspect (rooms & stables, fences, major and minor improvements), and card-playing for enhanced abilities (professions and minor improvements).

The game is driven by food.  Food, food, food.  You must feed your family or else the coyotes will get them and you will lose.  Food is so important that it's everyone's primary concern.  Resources are most useful in the ways they enable you to purchase things and/or play cards that enhance your food production efficiency.  Plus, more family members equals more food consumption but more actions.  Tricky balance.

I don't have (non-geometrical) animeeples yet, wooden or plastic.  I am sad.  My cubic sheep do not frolic.

Rated an 8 (vs. a 9 or 10) because while food drives the players, the cards drive the game.  The cards a player draws will determine the best direction, as well as strongly influencing the player's success.  Some cards are clearly better than others, and this disparity is glaringly obvious at times.

On the plus side, there are so many cards (E, I, K, Z decks) that replay value is very high.

On the minus side, scales poorly to 5.  More players means a *much* longer game and a *much* rougher game (more contention for worker placement).  With 4 or 5 players, going 4th or 5th really bites.  (In one 4 player game, I went 4th for 4 rounds out of the first 5!  Very not good.)

My recommendation is 3 players max, 4 if at least three of them are familiar with the game.  I do not recommend playing a 5 player game (though I suppose sometimes we must).

Similarly, there's a lot for a new player to absorb.  The sheer number of choices is overwhelming at first, particularly since there are so many different strategies that require such different directions and planning.  In addition, the initial hand of 14 cards can be difficult to grasp and/or use.  If you're playing a teaching game, plan on it going much longer than you'd hope.

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT play this game with the AP-prone.  You will regret it.  You have been warned.

You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.  You must play Agricola.

Really, just give in, give it a shot and determine for yourself whether it lives up to the hype.  In my opinion, it does and it's worth every dollar, euro, swiss franc or currency-of-choice.

First I was reluctant, but finally I embraced the Agricola's rave. Interesting for both experienced and new players due to the angst to feed your family. I have played mostly the basic game; therefore I have a lot to learn with the advance game (it seems that I am one of the few persons that does not like the designer's solution to give replayability to the game: 14 initial and different cards per player to choose from).

The quintessential worker placement game, not an easy one, but a great one.

Meu comentarios originais estavam em inglês, por conta da minha cópia original e as expansões que tinha,todas gringas.

(Provisional rating.) An almost perfectly tuned power and action selection "economic" game with a fun theme. Opportunities for some creativity in the choice of what to emphasize, especially if a drafting system is used to select Professions and Minor Improvements. Just a bit too long and fiddly to be great.

Easy to explain. It's part fun, part work. Finding ways to feed your family without sacrificing your animals or lots of grains/veggies (i.e. your points) is pretty difficult, even in the family game. I think the cards would make things easier as well as harder.

This is great stuff! The optimization and the story arc of building a farm fit perfectly together. And works very well with any number of players, too.

It's a great game, even in the family game mode, but of course it wins a lot in strategy and tatics with the occupation and minor improvementsm even with some saying that the cards can screw the game because some cards are better than others and can make good combinations, I don't think the cards are the most important aspects in this game, and I think the board game part is way more important than the card part.

RATING: 7.2
Very good game, but I'm not getting the fandom it receives here.  I don't think I've ever turned down a game of it, but occasionally it feels like work (mostly when you can see who's winning but have to wait a couple of hours for it to happen).

Update: years after the first few goes, I've had another game.  I enjoyed it, but I dunno whether it'll ever beat 8 on my scale unless we switch to variant rules that allow for hand management.  In the recent game, the bloke who drew the best hand at the start won, and looked like he would from the get go.  Throughout the game he seemed to have the luxury of making second-best moves quite regularly (certainly the guy who seemed savviest over the board never had a chance; he came in a distant second, and no I am neither of these people).  I can understand the point of, and thoroughly appreciate, a shorter luck based game in which, over multiple plays, this all washes out, and I can also understand the point of etc a longish luck based game where a lot of fancy and skilful tap dancing is needed across the game to make the most of your luck, but a long game skewed by a card deal at the start is not so great.  (Drafting's the obvious fix, which I haven't tried yet.)  Doubtless some of Agricola's compensating virtues are still invisible to me, but I'm not that interested in bludgeoning my way to an appreciation of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hard to say whether any game TRULY captures the choices of a 17th Century, European, subsistence lifestyle but I imagine a scarcity of resources and a general disdain for the differences between green and brown were closer to fact than fiction. The playing area is fiddly and messy. Animeeples are a must, and their absence from standard versions of the game smack of an unfinished product. 

Mechanically, worker placement, like deck-building, is one of those artificial gaming genres that is much less interesting than it seems. Resource conversion games are a dime-a-dozen, yet Agricola seems to find a nice blend of manageable quantities with variable qualities. Occupation cards and Improvements keep things interesting, but also add a degree of variance unusual for a game requiring this much mathematical analysis. 

There is something of a masochistic dynamic to Agricola. It definitely feels like work, but sometimes in a rewarding way. I wouldn't say I look at my farm with pride so much when I'm finished - I always feel like there was more I could have done differently - but I do think, for a game, Agricola does a remarkable job of making you feel that the struggles to build and feed a household from scratch. I'm still bothered by player order issues, and don't think the in-game option to change order solves the Eurogame problem of the experienced player leeching from the inexperienced player upstream. 

Overall, I don't mind Agricola, and it's a game I might return to when my kids are teenagers. It's a game I'm happy to play if you need a third or fourth (won't play two or five), but it's not a game I think has much impact beyond the board. In other words, it's a fun and immersive puzzle, but lacks the narrative punch of a truly great game. 
.
I'D RATHER WE PLAY: A strange comparison, but at this stage I'd rather play [thing=13][/thing]. Agricola is one of the more engaging modern Euros I've played, but I find the reliance on competent play from opponents a dealbreaker for the effort required. This is a problem I have with the genre overall. If I was going to own one of this type of game, this would be it.

[b]Impressions after one play (Family version):[/b]
Agricola was no.1 on BGG when I first came here. Since then, I wanted to try it, to see what makes it so special.
It's a game where you try to build your farm, raise animals, plow and harvest fields, and feed your family.
What I like:
- it runs very smoothly and it doesn't take too long to explain
- you are really connected to what you are doing
What I didn't like:
- it feels that it's over too soon (you don't have enough time to do everything you want)

+ Minor improvements and Occupations add to the complexity of the game
- becomes AP-prone and lasts too much

Mechanically, this is an ok Eurogame. However, both the theme and the fact that it's a Eurogame do not really appeal to me (although the fences and the animals look cool!). The cards in your hand can and willnmake the game unbalanced, and make you feel treated unfairly. That one time you can pull off a really cool combo with those cards doesn't make up for the fact that the cards in other cases play themselves... Paradoxically, the "family version" is more balanced and less luck-depended (since you have no hand cards).
But I think if you like Eurogames and don't hate the theme, this could be one of the better games for you. 
Only keep in mind that with a lot of players, the duration of the game (and also downtime in between turns) lengthens drastically. It's playable solo too, which takes about only 20 minutes.

[With the Z-Deck & Farmers of the Moor, for whatever that's worth]

Huh, it really is as good as they say, perhaps.  Addicting as heck, Caylus-you-can-play-three-times-in-a-row good.  I have yet to win, of course, but that's to be expected.

REVISED:  After 7 plays (in short order), I'm downgrading "the 'gric" from a 10.  It's a very good game, yes.  It's not as amazing as it looks at first; there is a certain _sameness_ even with the cards, once you learn how to optimize fairly effectively, not the endless variety the cards seem to promise, but don't really deliver.  Jambo and Race for the Galaxy aren't the same kind of thing, obviously, but they may deliver more variety in the end than Agricola does, and that's a good thing.

REVISED:  Haven't played in a while, downgrading -- the issues with Le Havre show me some of what makes this not as good as it should be, and the "build THIS farm" bugs me more in retrospect.  Still a solid game, of course, but over-rated.

REVISED AGAIN:  Ok, played more, added Through the Seasons, etc.  You build the same farm and wish for more resources, and find the cards unexciting.  At least I do.  Meh.

REVISED AGAIN:  Farmers of the Moor I like in some ways but I still don't like Agricola that much, alas.

It's one of those worker placement and maximize your victory points type of game. 

The whole game evolves on what cards you begin with and max out what's on the table. 

It's boring because it so dependent on whats left on board to do on your turn. The game felt that the player on the right tells you what you can do and the flow goes round the table. An entertainment of restrictive play. 

It's interesting because, from the above chaos, you can still manage to assemble some form of cohesion to get victory points. 

Not the best game but it does entertain your inner frustration. A game that truly plays the player.

An interesting game, not initially as engaging as I expected, but the adaptability of the game is it's greatest asset. The push for efficiency keeps gamers honest with significant consequences for those who lack the 'Knizia-like' ability to score in multiple areas. The solitaire game is interesting and I've played two and three player games. I like the balanced nature of the E and I decks but anecdotally felt the K deck was un-balanced by the wet nurse.

While I love Agricola, I recognize that it boils down to a lot of number crunching and hoping that your turn plans don't get foiled. This game has very little luck, so experienced players will easily dominate new players, which can be very demotivating for new people to keep playing.

RATING: 8.5
Playing the game is similar to playing the boardgame version of harvest moon.  

Players control 2 - 5 pieces/workers to plow fields, sow seeds, upgrade house, reproduce offsprings (for more pieces), fence up stables, collect animals, collect food, make a minor or major improvements for the player.

At every harvest phase of the game, enough food must be supplied to every piece players controlled in the game or players have to beg to food to feed them.  In the harvest phase, seeds that are sowed will be harvested, animals could be breed and multiply.  At the 14th (last) round, victory points are counted and the one with the most victory points wins.

Good points: Every action move taken first will result in delaying of taking other actions.  All actions seemed to be equally tempting. Actions could be snatched by other players which makes the game more interesting.

Bad points: The worst user manual I have ever read so far.  It took me a long time before I can understand the game.  For those who doesn't like luck factor in the game, a good set of occupation & minor improvement cards will really make a difference in the game.  If playing on single player, it is tiring to refill all the resources alone and may forget to refill at all.

A future classic. Three games in one box.

You are a farmer with a basic farm - over the course of the game you are trying to make the best farm by assigning workers to actions.

By taking an action you block it for all other players.

You start with just two workers but they can reproduce giving you more actions per turn, but any offspring must be fed every harvest season and failure to do so is disatrous.

A solitaire version for loners.
A family version that cuts some of the complexities out yet remains exciting and fresh.
The full version adds a dizzying array of cards (minor improvements to your farm and "occupations" for your workers)that make for a different game every time.

A challenging game that feels quite cut-throat with two players. There's a nice blend of long-term strategy mixed with tactical decisions along the way. Often times, your strategy going into round one will change drastically by later rounds, as you missed a chance to play the improvement or occupation you planned to play, got blocked out of a critical action, needed to deny your opponent of a critical action, or found a different path to victory based on the resources and actions available. The cards give this game the depth and variability to keep it engaging for years to come.

Solid game, in my top 5 worker placement games so far. 

However, in one game, we found game-end scoring cards to be extremely powerful with one player getting 11 points and little diversification beyond one of each item and no empty spaces. Since the player had the minor improvements and occupations that supported house expansion and upgrade, this was a natural route for him.

So, we did a quick look at our game sheets and noticed that the winner was always someone who had a combination of the most: stone houses, family members, and points from cards. And at least one other past game was won by a player that had house expansion and upgrade support cards. Maybe there is a pattern here?

*** Update 1: I never really want to play this game, but when we do play it, I enjoy it - very attractive game, nice cards, lots of choices, interesting mechanic, decent end-game scoring. I just can't explain why I'm not ever really enthused to play it. ***

*** Update 2: Now I can articulate why I don't care for Agricola. It is too long for what it's worth. My patience for lengthy worker placement games has worn thin, mostly because you do the same actions over and over again until you can hit a certain mass to trigger the game end condition, or until the final round is reached. I think it boils down to... I don't like "solitaire" style games with low interaction that are big time sinks. If it's under 2 hours from rules review to game end, then I can really appreciate it. Otherwise, it too much time to spend on a game. So, when is Agricola the card game or abridged version coming out? (Just cause it seems to be a trend with board game "suites".) ***

Substantially more fun than I ever thought farming simulators could be.
My only complaint is how stressful it can be, when someone takes resources you need, or you don't have enough actions in a turn to feed your family.  Perhaps I get too into it?

Gran juego de gestión de recursos con el objetivo de administrar la vida en una granja:construir la casa, aumentar la familia, cuidar de los animales... Mediante el método de elección de roles vamos posicionando a los miembros de la familia en las diferentes acciones que van saliendo a lo largo de la partida. De 2 á 5 jugadores, funciona muy bien pese a lo farragoso de la disposición inicial. Mantiene la tensión durante toda la partida.Importante uso de cartas, cosa que a mí personalmente no me agrada del todo. Gran rejugabilidad., para muchos el mejor juego de mesa de la historia. Para mí no pero sí de los mejores, sin dudarlo.

I can see the appeal, but it just haven't caught me in the way other games have yet. Still not given up, though, but will probably prioritize other games when able.

Also, GF hated it, so it might not get as much table time just because of that.

My opinion of this game has changed since I first bought it. At first I thought it was great. Now I think it's amazing.

The problem with owning so many games is that you really want to play all of them. You want to make sure you're justifying every purchase, but I don't know if I can do that with Agricola. Every time I've played the game has been a unique and satisfying experience. I've not played a game of this where I felt that I went into it a set strategy.

I've heard a lot of complaints that people do not like "building the same farm over and over", but I think they're missing the point a little bit. It's not about the product at the end, it's about the journey to get there. We all know what it takes to make the most points; it's written right on every player aid card. The problem is that getting there is not easy for everyone, especially with the time limit set on the game.

It's a great experience. With so many decks, variations, and now expansions coming out I can see myself owning and playing Agricola for a long time.

This is a fun worker placement game. It can be a bit daunting learning to play. Scoring as well should be explained up front. A little bit of everything does better than focusing on just one thing. Overall is a lot of fun. Trying to feed your family is the main thing to worry about here. Definitely has a constant pressure feel on it.

Along with Le Havre it is my favorite strategy game (Puerto Rico is less engaging but funnier somehow). Agricola is a masterpiece in every respect. Everything works perfectly. The only home rule I made for two players is to start the game with three farmers instead of two in order to have more actions to perform. In two the game can be incredibly short sometimes. Lot has been said and written on this game, I can't but stress how this work really put your mind at work! At the end, whether you win or lose, you always have a very gratifying experience.

A surprisingly well-themed engine-building game; and not all that different from most engine-building games, apart from an unending supply of options. Nevertheless, it IS a very good game!
It's only real negatives are two:
1) There is not a great deal of player interaction, apart from, "Hey! I wanted that action, and now you've taken it!", and
2) It is waaaay too long for what it offers. If I want an engine-building game (which I don't, very often), I (and you!) can get the same challenge from shorter games....Carson City, anyone?

I like the theme and I enjoy building my little farm, but in both my two plays so far I have felt rather overwhelmed. Since I own and enjoy both Puerto Rico and Caylus, I can't see that this game would add much to my collection. It's less elegant and more frustrating than either. So while I'm happy to play it when invited to do so, I don't think I'll ever buy it. (My wife doesn't like it, which is the last straw!) I can see why the game is popular on BGG, but I take its popularity as a warning not to trust the ratings too much. (I bought PR purely because it was no. 1, and also selected Ticket to Ride on the basis of its ratings--both of those were successes.)

Don't care much for the farming theme. I don't find  farm animals cute. I am not enamored by the idea of baking bread or raising children or growing crops.

I also don't like secret/hidden magic/power cards. As far as I am concerned, the only hidden power in a game should be the gamers brain. 

I do like the crunch of worker placement games where you can be pushed out of resources if you don't plan well enough. Very excruciating. Love it. 

I like the family version of the game.

A bit fiddly at first so first game was more frustrating than fun but after that I've really enjoyed it. The tons of cards add variety and helps against scripted gameplay. Large opportunites for blocking other players so more confrontational than what one might original think. Cute theme, particular if playing with a set where the bland cubes have been exchanged with tiny animals and veggies.

A fun game, very similar to many other euros like puerto rico, with the excitement of resource management and variable actions.  But it also has the downfall of most of those euros where you are trying to build your "efficiency machine" and as soon as you are getting to where you can do the things you want, the game is over.  Also, there is little interaction in the E deck, maybe that will change with the I-Deck later.

RATING: 8
A worker placement game with (unfortunately) "points salad" scoring that forces diversity.  The best part of the game is the tension/stress that comes from having to feed your family.  There are a lot of different occupation and improvement cards that change the feel and strategy of each game, so you can't just optimize your play once and repeat.  I've heard Caverna allows you to win without having to diversify, but to me that's part of the challenge of Agricola and what makes it so tense at times.

Simply amazing game, lot of thinking, and the thinking time is very enjoyable.  One may complain the turns takes too long, but I think that's part of the fun.  You have a lot of choices, deciding which one to pick and how you can plan to get the best result.  Each game is solving different problem with the cards you have and the choice other people made.

Played once, and a 9 rating, because it is simply a very fine game. The system is simple and simple to teach too. And it has a lot of replay-ability, The "Family" game, The game with the E deck, and then the I deck and the K deck, then add in the mix and match of the decks and the optional / variants of switching the cards in both the minor improvement and the occupation decks. It is a winner. And the theme fly better with the family. A++

Edit: Play second time, this time with family on the family version. Upgrade to a 10 because it is not just a heavy Euro, but can be done with family too. My 8 years old is having a fine time. Although game play is a bit long on the first game, but it can be improved after repeat play.

RATING: 9
If the first time I play a game I think it's a 10, I'll rate it an 8.  There's just no way to definitively say a new game is a 10, although many of those first 8s rise to a 9 or 10 after several plays.  Agricola is different.  I recognized at once that Agricola is a game that I will "always want to play" and that "this will never change."  I understand that the cards may bring too much randomness into the game, but I don't see that changing my rating.  Perhaps some sort of drafting scheme?

I was sceptical when I read that this is a game that you're a farmer. Seriously? Well I decided to give it a shot and I was instantly drawn into what is one of the best worker placement/crisis management games out there! A fantastic game and among my favourites! It scales very good with any number (haven't played it with 5...) and with such a huge variety with the different decks (even in only the base game there are 3 decks!) every play is different and you have to carefully plan what you'll do while you keep an eye to your opponents and try to see what cards they're playing and try to take the resources and actions you can before they do! The solo experience is also very good with it's puzzly feeling!

Hrmm....my enjoyment of this game has gone down quite a bit.  (Update: and it's back up again!  Hooray for 2-player!)  The initial awe at number of options and possibilities has definitely worn out, and I've only played the game a half-dozen times.  It's still a good game, but not OMGAMAZING.  There's not enough brain-burning-ness to excite me on that front, and, on the opposite end of the spectrum, not enough crazy wacky fun to pull me to the table time after time.  There just aren't enough *real* decisions made over the 90-120 minutes it takes to play the game...unless you're playing a fast 2-player game.  Which can be quite fun.

I have found that this game sparks a very polarizing response amongst my friends I introduce to it.

I've never played a game of Agricola I didn't like. It appealed to everyone I've played with. But something about it doesn't entirely sit right for me - the available actions feel too obvious and the theme (or art) is too whimsical. The constant feeling of never having an adequate farm makes the struggle feel frustrating. It's a brilliant design but I'd rather play more nuanced and less punishing worker placement games.

Really fun game, with not much luck, at least if not playing with the cards. Really feels that you are a person trying to survive in the middle-ages, since it's tough to get all that food you need and still winning the game with points. Haven't played so much with the cards, so shouldn't really say so much about them, but they are not really to my liking. Feels like something separate from the game and not so fun. The game is tight which is fun. But since avoiding negative points is the most important thing, you feel that you really have to do a little bit of everything, which is not so fun. Leaves little real choices sometimes.

Stressful, but in a good way.  It's rewarding to see your farm at the end, and I feel that the variety is enough here to create different plays each time through.

With additional players (I often play two) this becomes completely different and almost as if you have to relearn how to play. Of course I know how to play, but the different strategies and resource balances and actions, etc. can make a winning 2p strategy near useless 4p. Makes it all the more brilliant, and challenging.

RATING: 8.5
A worker-placement/resource management game. It's easy to teach (though we had some problems learning our first time, as it was the group's first worker-placement game). It has built-in scaling to make it enjoyable for any number of players.  The many decks of Improvements and Occupations (and the sheer number of cards and combinations in each) guarantee a lot of replay value for it.

There are a lot of fiddly bits representing the resources available to your farming village, which must be fiddled with constantly, which can get time-consuming, especially later in the game or with more players. Second, there are some definite balance issues between some of the cards available, with some being all-around useful, some being useful if you have set your family on a certain path to prosperity, and some just sitting in your hand forever.

(Update) Tried a "drafting" mechanic for assigning occupations and minor improvements after seeing somebody recommend it here.  It's a fairly solid variant: it prevents the issue of getting dealt a crap hand, but it's still frustrating to see somebody (other than me, of course) playing a Wet Nurse.

Agricola is one of that rapidly expanding family of action selection and economic engine building games.  The sheer and growing choice of available actions is reminiscent of Caylus, as is the competition to grab them before an opponent.  Thematically, I think this doesn't quite work in Agricola; why can't I bake bread because a neighbour fired up her oven before me?  However, the rest of the game gives a decent sense of building up a farm.  I have only played the full game, which introduces a huge variety of occupations and minor improvements to increase the strategic options.  The scoring system rewards diversification of crops and livestock and there's a real sense of time pressure to get it all done in just 14 turns.  Agricola plays quickly and doesn't outstay its welcome.  The quality of the components and the artwork is good, though something other than cubes to represent the livestock would have been nice.

This may be the best Euro efficiency game that I've played.  And yet the issues I have with this genre remain.  Player interaction is limited to thwarting another player by taking an action ahead of them; there is no trade, no cooperation, no burning of barns.  Agricola feels to me like a multi-player puzzle, albeit a highly variable one.  This isn't how I like to spend my gaming time.

UPDATED: (7 -> 8) More games with improved start techniques like keep 7 of 10 Occupations and Minor Improvements or card drafting makes the game *much* richer strategically.

UPDATED: (5.5 -> 7) I played again and I have to admit that there are fun things about Agricola.
-------------------------------------
INITIAL: Agricola is another moderately boring, lack-of-interaction, everyone has their own mini-board resource efficiency game (see Puerto Rico, San Juan, Princes of Florence, etc.).  That said, for the style, it has been interesting enough to bother learning what makes it tick.

NOTE: The rule variants (back of instructions) for varying the initial card distribution mechanism resolves the glaring weakness with the game -- luck with initial cards is much more important than strategy.

Family growth, y'all know what that means right?  Aw yeah! Keeping warm in the farmhouse.

We've played the family game twice now that rating is likely to climb with more plays.  We're using a set of HO scale farm animals, makes the game so adorable you could get cavities playing it.  I like that you're rewarded for having a diversified farm, and I like it that your sheep can live in the house.

Well I didn't dislike this game and quite enjoyed it a bit. The addition of the small investments/crafts-card creates mainly fuzz to this basically clean game. Actually it spoils this puzzle-like game. Therefore I would like to play the variant without one day for a final judgement.

Besides the game takes too long for what it's offering.

Excellent game. Endless replayability thanks to the hundrends of occupation and improvement cards. Has lots of tension, enough interaction and it is quite thematic. One of the best eurogames out there. Provides many interesting options for the players. Components are great. Definitely a gamer's game although it also includes a family version.  Highly recommended!

Fantastic game, wonderful sense of building up one's own farm, with just enough player interaction, chiefly through worker placement blocking other players. The cards give enough variety to make every game interesting: you can plan a strategy at the beginning (and throughout) but you also have to make a lot of tactical decisions when your plans don't work out. Very tight, works well for all player counts.

I like the FOTM expansion for variety (and more to think about!), but I still like the game without the expansion as well.

RATING: 6
This just isn't fun out of the box.  As is, the game takes about 30 seconds to determine a winner, and 2-3 hours to play.  Those 30 seconds are the random card draw for occupations and improvements.  With variants and mods, this is a much better game.

I've liked Agricola more, but now it seems to me  that All Creatures Big and Small is much better, and Agricola itself gets more and more boring with time.

I could see this going higher with more plays.  The set-up time and fiddliness of getting the resources set out each round is a mark against, but again I could see that going away with experience.  Generally, though, I think I prefer a bit more interaction.

Hear me out!  I picked this up and played a few games with my wife.  It was fun, but it didn't see much table play (we have to be in the right mood for a euro, and it can be a long play sometimes).  

It's a rock solid worker placement, and I like how the cards add tons of variety to each game.  But as infrequently as we play it, the variety isn't really required with us.

Fantastic game! I really enjoy the sense of urgency you get while trying to balance out all your options. I love that it can be played solo. I also love that when my 9 year old daughter and I play together, we can play to beat our old scores rather than against each other. I think this is one of the few games that play very well with many different people and situations. 
About the components, at first I thought I would run out and get the animeeples and such, but in reality I have no problems with cubes and discs and find my imagination goes a long way. So much so that often use cattle to power my power plants! :)

Rating went down an 8.5 instead of 9.5 after playing a 5 player game. It was ok but seemed to take too long. I still enjoy a 2 player game, but after playing Eclipse I realize I like to have more interaction in my games.

Great tight worker placement/farm building game that constantly keeps the pressure on you due to needing to feed your family at the end of each harvest. 

It's fun to teach new players with the "family edition" using no cards. And then once you get experience the cards take it to the next level. Plus there are SO MANY in just the base game. 

Every game is always close, with the cards every game will be different.

12+, but many BGG parents suggest much younger, 1-5 players, best with 3-4, 120 mins. Contains the regular/family game (E Deck), Interactive cards (I Deck) and Complex cards (K Deck). Enough variation for many games. Many think there is no need for any other expansions as there is so much in the base game. Farmers of the Moor changes the game quite a bit. NO ANIMEEPLES in older editions of this game, only in the 2011 edition. The Goodies expansion has both animeeples and vegemeeples.

I love the theme, the animeeples, the worker placement, etc. But it requires a bit more thinking than I am usually in the mood for. I play a solo variant that I found on bgg, where one rolls 2d6 to determine where the competing AI would land. I'm just about to start adding the cards in. Like I said, a bit too much thinking/planning for my usual mindframe.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Once the #1 listing on BGG overall, and I'd say that's accurate. Worker placement, tons of variable cards, initial strategic draft, lovely Klemens Franz art, deep thematic integration, devious player interaction, (some) engine building, great build-your-own-player-board, and external pressure with thematic scoring.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The pressure of the game is excellent. I absolutely disagree with people who say this game is "punishing" or should be called "misery farm." In 30+ games, I've seen someone take a begging card... ONCE. And then they played Mendicant to get rid of it. Honestly, no one should be taking begging cards. This is a not a "you suck at this game" comment, but more according to the spirit of the design--if your post-Black Death family is going to make it in the long haul, you need to diversify your farm so one singular blight doesn't wipe it all out. That's the scoring scheme in a nutshell, and the feed-your-family harvest mechanic keeps you on that track. It's not truly constraining, it just captures the theme of the game both in each harvest and each part of the scoring rubric. As a result, the challenge and fun comes from seeing how much you can exploit the game state (and other players) to excel in spite of the constraints.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Playing with the huge number of cards is both a strength and weakness, though I still say it's playtested/balanced far in favor of strength. That said, even with drafting, some games simply feature cards with little synergy and oomph, leading to more generic play. I've never found these sessions lacking, but I have noticed exceptional games with especially fun gameplay as a result of excellent, complimentary card play.

Raised to a 9 after getting my own copy in a trade and playing more games, including a few solo sessions and the family version, and thoroughly enjoying each play.

After one play. It is a great looking game with a fantastic range of components. I enjoyed it and look forward to playing again, however I'm becoming slightly wary of this type of game. Even in its basic form there is a bewildering array of options; so many that my instinct is this somehow negates genuinely skilled or strategic play. I feel that even with a number of games under my belt I'll still just be doing the few obviously important tasks (enlarging family, ensuring they are fed), then trying to find a path in the forest and hoping it doesn't lead off the edge of a cliff. 

Maybe that's a disservice, and more games will prove me wrong. Or maybe that's how the game was designed.

A lot of other raters seem to be placing a fair amount of importance on the cards in hand. I didn't get that impression in my (basic) game. The timing of actions seemed to be a much bigger factor.

There's nothing I don't like about this game.  It's very challenging, maximizing your farm production while being sure to feed your family.

I haven't played but five (11) times, with a couple dozen solo plays, single and two-handed and four-handed, but I learn something new every time and its gratifying when your random card draw garners some nice combos you have never seen before.

Despite the fact the group I'm with has almost every game ever printed, I bought this specifically so that I could play solo and become at least some what competitive.

I love the endless choices.  High replayability, with multiple paths.  There is some pressure to feed your family, but if you get set up early, food is not even an issue.  I like it over Puerto Rico because you're actually building something.  At the end of the game you can see your farm, rather than just buy tiles that have VPs on them.  They're both fun, but Agricola has the edge.

My go-to euro game for intermediate players and I'll play it every chance I get. Building a farm and the meeples add an aesthetic quality to the game which IMO appeals both to min/max type of players and those who appreciate more freeform play. Also, that which is sometimes pointed out as a weakness of Agricola, namely that players should aim for doing a bit of everything as opposed to specializing, is precisely what I like about this game so much. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
We really enjoy this game, but its structure is a little too rigid. Every game goes the same number of turns, the same actions come out in the same window of time, and you always want to get some of everything if possible. Still a really fun game, but I think this keeps it from being better than Puerto Rico

A mediocre worker placement game.... Without the cards. 
Using the cards only makes it more random. I see no reason for some cards to exist in the base game if there were proper playtesting. You are going to play 2 hours of a game that was mostly decided when the cards were dealt in the beginning? Also, them being hidden makes it difficult for the others to know what you are up to so as to stop you somehow.
The scoring system is the second bad aspect of the game that ruins it for me. It practically forces all the players to build the same farm more or less.

Previously I wrote why I didn't like this game that much (too complicated, too fiddly, too whatever). But after teaching this to more and more people with different gaming backgrounds (new gamers, experienced gamers, etc.) the game's merits have started to come out.

Agricola is a wonderfully strategic game that comes with multiple ways to play (family, standard - with whichever decks you choose). The family game is perfect for a medium weight game akin to Stone Age, while the standard game introduces many different nuances, tactics and paths for people to take.

Overall Agricola is a lot of fun to play no matter how you play it and can work for a number of different situations and people. Oh and for those who are wondering I greatly prefer this to Le Havre (still haven't tried any of Uwe's newer stuff however).

Originally hated this game but started playing it again when my wife got into gaming. Turns out it was much more enjoyable as a two-player game. Random placement of the cards can be a little frustrating at times as thing don't always come up when you'd like and makes for some awkward situations but offers some challenge.

Oh My Goh. Addictive. Such a pensive game. It was interesting that it didn't reward specialisation as many euro games do but it really forces competition because it means that all players want mostly the same things. 
Awesome cards as well

I have to say I admire this game more than I enjoy it, at least the full game. The family version I think is perfect - that's the 10 - I expect that's at odds with most people's opinion...

Caverna scratches this itch better for me now so I've traded Agricola.

Aunque por temática y aspecto puede parecer sencillo o infantil se tata de un juego bastante complejo. Las opciones durante la partida son numerosas y muy variadas.
En definitiva, se trata de un eurogame en toda regla, completísimo y muy entretenido. Recomendable 100%.

RATING: 6
Bought this game because it sounded more 'competitive' than Caverna, was cheaper, and was rated very highly.

The game is fun, but the theme is not for me. The hand of cards you are dealt in the beginning makes for very interesting and different strategies, but the spots on the board do not change much game to game.

I don't like how you have to get a bit of everything to score high. I heard Caverna lets you focus on one thing if you like, which leads to more diverse gameplay (?). I sold my copy on 15-Jan-2016.

RATING: 8.5
Very good game of forward planning.

It works well with any number of players. Even solo.

The only thing that bugs me is when you have a newbie trying to make sense of the 14 cards he receives at the beginning. I tried to reduce the number of cards and even eliminate them altogether when playing with first-timers, but they are the heart of the game and can't be taken off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Optimizing limited moves and maximizing diversity/points.  What's not to like?  OK, my one minor complaint is that there are a few actions that are very powerful so it is partially luck based on who gets to take the action first.  However, some downplay their significance.

Muchas partidas no registradas.

Para mi uno de los mejores eurogames que existen. Desde que vi su idea, estando aún en desarrollo, me pareció simplemente genial. Lo tuve incluso en Alemán, cuando no había edición en Castellano.

Una rejugabilidad brutal debido a la enorme cantidad de cartas. Suelo jugar, eso si, con la opción draft para preparar un poco los combos y la estrategia de partida debido al amplio abanico de posibilidades (evidentemente no se llega a todo).

Diseño bonito, componentes chulísimos (tengo todos los meeples y componentes asociados al juego en castellano... hasta la postal). Se hace fácil para cualquiera, sea veterano o jugador exporádico. Eso sí, este juego tiene una profundidad estratégica muy grande, como pocos eurogames. No es ninguna perita en dulce.

En su parte negativa poco puedo decir. Tal vez poca interacción directa (pisar acciones de otro y en algunas cartas del mazo I... poco más). Hay veces que como tomes varias malas decisiones o quieras ir a todo te puedes ver con una granja patética a mitad de la partida y sin posibilidad de remontada.

En definitiva un juego magnífico.

I really wanted to like this game, but it feels like such a chore, and you are always falling short.  It's too fiddly to really strategize, but too much setup and disappointment to ride through.

RATING: 2.5
I wanted to like Agricola, but the more I play it, the more I hate it. I don't mind getting cut off from a resource. What I do mind is that once I get cut off from said resource, I have no alternatives that actually lead somewhere.

There's really only one strategy to win. The farming theme/premise is attractive to me, and I very much enjoy worker placement games; yet in Agricola, there's only one way to play. If you don't get a leg up on your opponent early on, you end up just chasing them for the rest of the game.

Basically it's like chess: the more practiced player will almost always win, and there's nothing but frustration for the other player(s) as they watch that process play out. At the end of every single game I've played, I was left with a feeling of "If only I had..." or "But I almost..." -- when what I want to feel is "That was fun!" This just doesn't cut it, sorry.

This is a really must have! I would rate the game balance an 8 (yes you can have ugly cards to deal with all the game), every feeling during the game a 12, all the rest a 10, so it's a 10.

A decent game, but not perfect.  I think I would like this better if there were either fewer spaces on the board or more of them.  As it stands it seems like it's always a great idea to grow your family, which could be solved with sharper limits on the number of ways to get food and other resources, but it might not leave much of a game.  I'm also not sure I like the structure of the game, where you select from a constantly dwindling set of options.

RATING: 2
A serious, solid game, but alas, a boring one. The cards are all "special" cards, and in a 5-player game each player has 14 of his own plus the major improvements! The combinations are hard to evaluate and I don't see how they all could possibly have been playtested. Naturally, some combos are clearly a lot better than others, so the luck of the draw can be a big factor. 

The only interaction is in choosing roles, and if someone picks the one you wanted you'll have to completely re-think your selection. The whole thing is clunky, with a zero excitement level, and after your turn you can go read a book for a few minutes. Oh, yeah -- the game drags on far too long, and I pondered quitting after the first two hours. 

My second and third plays found me constantly thinking "When will it end, already!?" Expansions just make things worse. While I like the concept, the whole affair feels more like work than anything else. I hope I never have to play again.

Pretty interesting.  I need to try it more.  I enjoyed it but the initial drawback seems to be that there are so many options, it can be hard to figure out what to do.  I did okay, but the more casual gamers I played with were pretty lost and never really got their farms going.

It's an ok game.  Not sure why people are soooo excited about it.

They say the cards yield a high replay value...Hmm since you can't play all the cards (usually 7 of 16)  It seems like you just play what is given to you.  Since there is no interaction in the early set of cards, I find it weak.  I'll try the I cards next time.  Maybe I'll come around.

The game also fits the theme nicely.  Just fun and clever.

Only played the family version so far. Really enjoyable but a little on the quiet and cereberal side. Not much talking during games, hopefully the cards will make a difference when we start using them.

With the cards this game is great. So much to do, lots going on, Believe the Buzz! It's satisfying, deep and enjoyable.

I've done the BGG thing and added model animals, they're fragile but add a bit of fun to the game.

I'm starting to think that the cards are merely a distraction to what you actually need to be doing. They are fun though it's just you sometimes become a bit blinded by the cards and forget what is important. Still the game is more interesting with them than without.

I am fairly new to the board gaming world. Agricola I saw on a TV show and thought it looked interesting. I purchased and played this game and it has now opened me up the board game world and am now slowing building my collection. I do really enjoy this game. I have only played it with 2 players so can only give this perspective. I personally find the game a bit short for the level of depth. I feel like just as you are getting somewhere the game ends. It may be a better experience with 4 players so hoping one day to give that a go once I can find an extra 2 people to play with.

RATING: 10
Initial turn order issues?  Perhaps.  Uneven card strength issues?  Definitely.  I prefer a front-to-back actions variant, a la Settlers, on the first turn: 1-2-3-4-4-3-2-1 in a 4P game, for example.  I massively prefer drafting cards, but with less experienced players I think drawing 10 and discarding 3 is also fine.  I never thought I would award a 10 rating other than Magic: The Gathering, but Agricola has earned it.  My play is usually only limited by the interest and schedules of my gaming group, but luckily for me they love the game almost as much as I do.  It's very safe for me to say that this is the best board game I have ever played, and my favorite one of all time.

There's so much to think about and be aware of in this game, but it seems very well balanced.  The theme and mechanics are both quite unique, and seemingly perfectly matched.  You really have to spread yourself out to do well, which is really tough.  It's a very good game, no doubt...I just can't seem to get myself excited about playing it.  The interactive deck is my favorite, followed by the complex deck - I don't want to play with the easy deck anymore.

RATING: 8
A charming worker placement game with a surprising amount of tension (5 players), and with a very gratifying sense of accomplishment, since it actually feels like you built something.  Makes for a brain-burner that is actually fun as well!

Edit:  Occupation and minor improvement cards are starting to wear on me.  Randomly getting cards can screw you before the game starts if you get a weaker draw.  Drafting takes too long.  At least with dice, you roll enough and your luck balances out usually.  But a little bad luck (or very good luck for someone else) at the beginning of Agricola offers no more chances to balance out the luck factor.  This has hurt the enjoyment of some of the sessions, and damped my enthusiasm for the game.

Great game, I learned it while teaching friends (famly game style) in a few minutes. There are some complex strategies, but the limited actions make the game engaging and keep the pace of it.

The base game without professions and minor improvement card plays rather simply. Some of the folks I play with tend to read tournament strategies and aren't aware of how little fun more casual players might experience. I don't need to win every game, but there are three other folks who feel rather crushed at this game. I'm not going to read tournament strategies. Maybe that's not a good way to judge the game, but it just isn't fun for me.

I have read a lot of the gripes about this game, but for a first play it was magic, I was a 10 year old boy again. Hopefully, that 10 year old is also fierce and will kick the crap out of my pessimistic present self should he arrive to ruin the party.
Update: the cards feel like I am having to reread the instructions everytime I play - yay! a bazillion poorly worded, obtuse cards. I am sure this will change when I am acquainted enough with the cards, but I think 'hype' really helped a lot of people through this tedium, and since hype is gone, I do not have that as motivation to push through this hurdle.
Update 2: We all took 5-10 minutes to become acquainted with our cards, the game ran smoothly and was fun.

RATING: 6
I don't get the love for this game.  It's a fine game, but you cannot win through specialization, which knocks it down quite a bit for me.  When I see people play this game, they keep talking about how many ways you can win, yet every farm looks nearly the same by the end of the game.

RATING: 8
The hand of cards that gets dealt to everyone at the beginning of the game can really give the game to the person with the best combo. Other than that, I enjoy the game quite a bit, but the "family" game (without the occupations and minors) gets kind of repetitive.

I'm hoping this game will get played more as the kids get older. My wife isn't usually too keen about playing it.

I was amazingly surprised on how interesting the game is. After the play i understood the reason behind the popularity of this game. Rating based on Family single player mode. Will try and get this to the table more with advanced rules.

Suppose I'm just jumping on the bandwagon, but I love this game. It's elegant, simple, and has a lot of variety owing to the initial draws. Still, it always leaves me feeling rushed. While I seem to do well enough at the game, it feels ... stressful to play, which is not entirely pleasant. It has what a lot of this genre lacks in the form of variable turn order (really disappointed that Uwe dropped this with Le Havre), a great deal of variety due to the card draws (though this randomness provides the game's only real weakness), and high production value. Having played Le Havre, I think the begging cards may be too punitive, but I find it hard to criticize the game otherwise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Lives up to the hype. Plays a lot like Caylus, only more variability with the card stages. Very analytical/mathematical--a highly complex game. Its only weakness is that there is no negotiation and very little direct player interaction. You have to pay close attention to your opponent's strategies, and try to do something opposite to that, so you aren't fighting for the same resources as your opponent throughout the game.

I am in the definite minority on this game.  While people see it as a deep strategy game, I am left cold and often frustrated after playing it.  The randomness of the initial card draws and subsequent card draws can have a huge impact on a game's outcome but the game is often touted as luck-less.  The game has a tight feel - so tight that each turn you are playing to minimize the efficiency losses that are bound to trip you up.  And those obstacles are thrown down in front of you by your fellow players, not as challenges to you but with cold indifference - as if you are merely someone else playing a game on the same field.  Is the game well designed?  Perhaps.  Is it the best game on the market? Hardly.

This is a pretty high strategy game. I like it but it does frustrate me a lot when playing.

I waited so long for this game and feel very satisfied with the results.  My wife and I are aspiring homesteaders so we love the theme. The variability from the multiple decks makes for incredible replay value.  This is my wife's favorite game. 

Update: I will only rate this game an 8 if there is card drafting involved for the minor improvements and occupations. Otherwise, this game is too often wildly unfair.

Upgraded my copy with miniatures from model train hobby shops.  Not something I would enjoy playing all of the time, but when in the mood, I like how critical all of the decisions are in the game.  The stress is what makes it enjoyable and feel like an accomplishment in the end.

Many have found the 'Feed Your Family' component to this unforgiving, but I rather enjoy this Rosenberg design, and can see why it has made such an impact on the Euro gaming community as a whole. It embraces its theme fully, where Caverna rather tiptoes around the subterranean/fantasy thing and just sort of transforms this into a more light, sand box style of game. Enjoy Agricola more. The pressure, the choices, a game that lives up to its hype for the most part, though I have others in this style I prefer.

This is essentially a puzzle solving game.  The more you play the better you get at solving the puzzle or optimizing your moves.  After 39 plays the shine still hasn't come off.  I think that getting the right draw of cards is significant in determining whether or not you're the winner, but more important is getting your food engine up and running.  This is a game which can appear daunting to people who have just played lighter games, but is fairly intuitive.

One of the nice things about this game is that it is a very strong 2 player game.  I play with my wife a lot, and she enjoys it as the flow seems to make sense and relate to how a farm would work.

After 13 plays I'm willing to concede that I may bump it up.  But I hate to bump it up, burn out, and then move it back down.

11/25/08 Bumped it up to a 9 as I'm playing this game a lot.

03/28/09 I think that I enjoy 5 players less than a fewer number of players. Seems as if card draws can weigh more heavily than skill in determining the winner.

This used to be my favorite worker placement game, but it has dropped off as I have played it more (and played other games). The basic mechanics are pretty straightforward, but I love finding synergies in the occupations and improvements. I also like the pressure that the game puts on you to make efficient decisions (I enjoy feeling like there isn't enough time to do everything I would like in a game). I know some people find this game too punishing and unforgiving. I don't find the punishing nature of feeding your people an annoyance. In fact, when I first played the game that was one of the things I liked best about it. However, after more plays I am finding that, while the pressure to feed your people doesn't bother me per se, I don't love that the game doesn't let me explore the space in the way I choose. Feeding your people is on target thematically, but I wish I had more choice in what I did each game rather than knowing that many decisions are forced upon me by that mechanic. I still really enjoy this game, but I'm finding that there are now other worker placement games I would rather get to the table.

My rating is for the family game. So far at least the "gamer" version with the mass of cards rates a little lower.
I seem to be unable to keep all the possibilities straight in my head and don't really have a clue what best to do each turn, especially when the Occupations and Minor Improvements are in play.

2010-04 Even playing 2-player with someone that I taught I've failed to score well in almost any game. The intricacies seem to be beyond me.

2010-07 Now I've played (a lot) more I'm probably just as willing to play either version of the game. As long as the others have played the "Family" game at least once before.

2011-07 After teaching a few people to play the "full" version I'd still rather teach the "Family" game but if the new people are wanting everything I'll teach that way.

2017-7
This has now been my favourite game for about 5 years. I prefer to teach the family version so new players have the base understanding of how things work.

2017-12 I've been gifted the revised edition. My plays will likely be more often that version now.

It's an amazing game, it just doesn't see that many plays these days. There's a whole lot of components in this game and the box weights a ton. Agricola can be a really fun game to play and the cards adds a whole lot of variety but it is perhaps a bit on the complex side.

This is an extremely well designed game with nice bits and complete rules that in the end makes it very clear what sort of Euro I do not really favor.  I feel like I am playing an interactive multiplayer puzzle of sorts with Agricola.

If you are looking for a worker placement game with lots of balanced aspects interacting, and with lots of exploration potential, this is a good bet.  When I want such a thing, which I sometimes do, this is what will come off the shelf as best of class (for what games I've played).

Not yet played. Not totally impressed by the components - the box has no insert whatsoever, the boards seems to have been cut the wrong way (with the main game on the sharp-edged "backside") and being the Z-man edition it has cubes and disks instead of meeples. I'd normally not bother so much with the meeples, but when most other editions (including the "Moor" expansion) has them and they're even shown in the rules examples I feel rather cheated.

Is Agricola elegant?  Certainly.
Is it finely tuned for every number of players? Yes.
Is it replayable?  With the hundreds of jobs and improvements, you would think so.
Is it fun?  Um...Not really.
The scoring system is a bit cumbersome and actively discourages specialization, so you have, essentially, the same narrow path to victory in every game.  Blah.

My wife and I have played this a few times and we really enjoyed it.  The biggest issue my wife has with the game is that she hates the feeling of not being able to accomplish everything and then to get penalized for not completing a task.  The other knock on the game is the simplistic pieces which loses some of the theme of the game for me.  However, I took some of the ideas here at BGG and improved the game a bit.  The game itself is a lot of fun. The game play changes a bit each time and you have so many different options.  I would like to get a few more game plays in but so far, it's one that we look forward to playing.

It does a great job of portraying how hard it was to be a farmer in the 17th century.

Love this game. First few games can be frustrating, as you're always fighting off starvation rather than getting to do the cool things you really want to do, but you'll have your animeeples to see you through those tough times. Then once you get a feel for how to set up a well-run food engine, gameplay becomes subtle and infinitely replayable. My only gripe is that there's not nearly enough cards for the two player game; we know them all too well by now.

Played a few times now,  so quite happy to give this a 10.  Excellent replayability obviously,  but not just due to the wide selection of cards - the game is also quite different depending on the number of players,  thanks to the different action spaces available.

The playing time concerned me at first,  but it is now coming down to less than 30 mins per player,  which is fine.

Now I just need to work out a way to play it better!

I've only played the family version, and just a couple o times online. Hence, mine might not be the best opinion about a game that is so beloved around here, but the bottom line is simple. I was intrigued by the scarcity of resources, which usually makes a very good game for me, but in the end, the sheer amount of possible routes reduced tension, and made me felt like I was solving a complex puzzle instead of playing a game.

I'd love to give this one a few tries more, but for now, it's no game I'd love to play again and again, much less actually commit to buying it.

Agricola is a great Euro style victory point collection game. It is a worker placement game with sturdy components and wooden pieces.

Players tend farms and raise their families scoring points along the way and facing challenges (feeding your family!).

Agricola is a bit complicated compared to other worker placement games and initially players may feel lost as to how well they are doing, so for beginners I recommend something more streamlined like Stone Age.

Pros: great strategy game with tough choices and competition for key spots on the board. Players struggle to both score points and maintain their family with food offering some really tough decisions and down to the wire game play
Component: Great quality
Solid mechanics

Cons: Design/theme is simple, farming isn't going to grab anyone attentions.
Colours are kinda bland
Rule book can be confusing and game play takes a while to master

The theme is integrated beautifully and I love the whole feel of the game.  I really want animeeples though...

I think I may be burnt out on the game currently, but I think that is just over the hype.  Need to let more people learn the game then get back into it without the slow movement of people trying to figure out what they are supposed to do on a turn.  A slow game of this is not a fun as it should be.

Rating Edit: Yep.  I have lowered the rating on this game.  The play is still great, it is more the players playing and their absolute blind obsession with the game.  It just makes it not fun to play.  Still a great game though.

I very much enjoyed getting to know the 'basic' game.  After a few initial plays it was a 10.  However after playing again after a few months gap against some 'experts', the game has lost its magic.  The starting card imbalance means that players are not equal.  It's not great fun playing with people who, like with Puerto Rico, have majored in the game and against whom I am only ever playing to avoid the wooden spoon.  I still enjoy the game.  But not as much as many others - including Le Havre.

So far this game is the real deal.  A lot has been said about the theme.  Personally I find it interesting.  I also like how the game really "feels like farming" -- which obviously sounds silly coming from someone who's never farmed before.

Still, the game mechanics manage to capture my imagination in a way that makes sense given the theme of the game.  There is some sorta strange drama in living on the precipice of starvation and trying to grow ones modest holdings in order to get beyond mere survival and into prosperity.

This is primarily a game of worker placement.  The majority of player interaction comes as a result of the scarcity of actions (since only one person can take advantage of each action every turn).

On the other hand, this is a game that rewards diversity over specialization.  A player with a diverse farm will be able to capitalize on a number of different actions shielding him from missing out on that one crucial move.

One thing I especially like about Agricola is the sheer number of options.  With over 300 cards there is a ton of diversity built into the game.  Maximizing your points given your available actions and cards dealt to you promises to be a different challenge each time you play.

Agricola... oh how I love to play you, oh how brain burning you can be. Agricola is a magnificent game, with a complexity that is hidden under a rather casual looking exterior. People with analysis paralysis will literally be stuck in Agricola, with the sheer amount of actions, all of which need to be done and are equally useful. But overall, Agricola is one of the prides of my collection for being a completely strategic game with little to no luck involved. I actually prefer Le Havre, but both are great! My only major criticism of both Agricola and Le Havre is that they take a good while to set up with the different boards, the card shuffling, and all the wooden pieces.

My favorite cube-pushing euro. I absolutely love the "oh god I need to do a million things but only have 2 actions" frantic feeling of it.

The game has the same mechanical feel of a cross between Puerto Rico and Caylus.  The actions don't seem compelling and the penalties are quite harsh.

A very interesting concept that is relatively simple in concept, but terribly difficult to understand good strategies.

Absolutely requires player aids to play adequately, I'd strongly recommend printing score charts and major improvement summaries for each player to reference during the game.

The game can feel a little bit like multiplayer solitaire despite having ruthless interaction in worker placement.  I was a little disappointed that the game didn't spark discussion except to clarify rules and get strategic advice.

so far through 10/25 all games I've played received a score of 30...at least I'm consistent :)

11/2 scored 43 in two player game.

RATING: 8
Talán a legéletszagúbb játék (leszámítva a "Pecunia non olet"-et:)), a legjobbak közt mindenképp. Az állatok szaporodására, és a vetés mechanizmusára gondolok. Még egy városi ember is elhiszi, hogy ez nagyjából így megy a valóságban is:) Nagyon igényes a kivitel. Pozitivum az is a játéknak, hogy a már megszokott akciókiosztásos mechanizmust felfrissítették a kártyákkal. Ezzel azonban ki is merült az eredetisége. Épp ezért nem adok rá több pontot, mert összevetve más, kevésbé favorizált játékokkal, nem érzem annyira újszerűnek az egésznek a mechanizmusát. Döntően csak korábban kitalált panelek lettek egymásra pakolva. Ráadásul a szerencsefaktor is túl nagy, ha a kezdő kártyakiosztást alkalmazzuk. Épp ezért a haladó kiosztást javaslom! Összességében nagy élményt ad, és kellően komplex ahhoz, hogy sokféle győzelmi taktikát kínáljon.
---
2 év szünet után újra előkerült a játék, és végre a családi változatot is kipróbáltam. Ez alapján azt mondom, hogy szívem szerint soha többet nem is használnék kártyát, az csak a "hogyan bonyolítsunk feleslegesen túl egy amúgy kártya nélkül is tök jól működő játékot" jegyében lett szerintem hozzá legyártva, meg azért, hogy ráírhassák, hogy 120 perc a játékidő. Kártyák nélkül 3 fővel 1 óra alatt lement az egész! A kártyás változat helyett inkább Caylusozok.

1st play: French Version (not my best language) after work, 5 players. Not a good way to start. Heavy game, lots of cards and with so many players it is tough to see the content of each card from a distance, lots of choices with me, in any case, not being on the right head to face it. Nevertheless, it did hit a certain spot so willing to give it another go..

edit: got the english version..better now? let's see..

EDIT: Up for trade, along with the Farmers of the moor Expansion, both sleeved since the beginning (sleeves included in trade)

Mainly played the IOS version, but it is fantastic. Good AI competition so far. The solo games are also a great way to learn the game.

Played actual game at DiceTower Con 2014. Fun to play with real players. Good table talk. But wow, the components are terribly cheap and it is quite tedious. Fortunate to have an experienced player to handle all the round to round needs.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent design as it is accessible to occasional gamers while demanding to seasoned ones. The individual farm-board permits to make calculation easy even when you're not mathematically inclined - while familiarising new gamers to acute planning. 

Yet, it's not challenging enough for my group (too little interactions), and too massive (large box, many chits, many rules) for improvised games with non-gamers (even if it's simple to understand and perfectly rendered, it demand too much goodwill). Also, the game is expensive and not radically different from other euros.

An enjoyable resource management game that really needs its rules rewritten in an understandable format as soon as possible. Youtube videos should not be needed to work out how the heck to play a boardgame. 

Still, once the rules became clear, the game is very easy to pick up, and plays well. You never have quite enough resources todo everything you want, which is great as it forces you to make difficult choices with a  tangible result. 

The game lacks a little bit in theme, and each game plays quite similarly, so I don't often get the urge to play it. It's good for the occasional play, so I'm glad I have access to it without having to buy it.

สมัยเมื่อ 10 ปีที่แล้วอยากเล่นบอร์ดเกมยูโรมาก แต่หาซื้อไม่ได้ และมีเงินน้อย จำได้ว่าช่วงนั้นมีคนรีวิวใน thaiboardgame.net แล้วอยากได้เกมนี้มาก เนื่องด้วย theme ที่ดูน่าสนใจ(ส่วนตัวค่อนข้างชอบธีมนี้) จนเมื่อประมาณปี 2013-2014 ได้มีโอกาสเล่นจริงจังครั้งแรกแล้วมีความรู้สึกว่า "เฮั้ย! เกมยากอะ แต่ชอบ" เนื่องจากต้องบาลานซ์คะแนนในแต่ละสาย ประกอบกับสิ่งที่ให้มาในกล่องทำให้มีความหลากหลายในตัวเกม บอกได้คำเดียวว่า 1-3 ในดวงใจตลอดการ คุ้มครับ คุ้มมากๆ สำหรับเวอร์ชั่นนี้

Despite my initial concerns (See my review for further thoughts there) Agrigola holds up. It's mainly a tactical "Make due with what you've got" game, but when viewed in that light it's excellent.

Agrisolo is a great way to spend two hours. The number of possible card combinations means that for me this will never grow old.

For a while they issued new decks faster than I could play them, much less achieve mastery. [perhaps 1,200 cards now] By re-mixing the card decks each time I could probably play a solo game several times a day forever and never face the same challenge twice.

Solo variant is relatively free late game destructive luck.

I know some say that this game is different enough from Caverna that there is a place for both in their collection.
And although I have not sold this game - there is a reason it only goes for $30 now - a - days !!

The cards in Agricola still give you more varying strategies then you would get from Caverna, but I will still probably never play this game again!!

RATING: 9
Played 2 x solo and 1 x a training 2 player family variant. The game is really nice (aesthetically just perfect actually), but now it is too early to give it more than 7.

Note 2008-11-17. Yesterday we managed to play a 4 player standard game with the E deck. Everyone enjoyed it, to the extent that one of girls mentioned "you know I play those games because I know my husband loves them and this one is the first one I really like". Definitely the game is very interesting, has a big sense of urgency and you can even be a little nasty to other. Thus I give them game 8 now, but quite honestly this game did not thrill me to an extend as Puerto Rico and Brass did.

Note 2009-12-07. This game plays very nice with 2 - its scalability was well thought over. And it is nice and tense. Therefore, its price per play is now much lower than majority of other games I own.

First four games.  Wow!  Just wow!  This game is so much fun.  The game is so enthralling I don't notice the time go by.  The game has so many hard decisions to make as you try to do/get everything to have the most well rounded farm.  The game is a great combination of so many mechanics found in great games, yet this one provides a very different experience.  It really is hard to put into words.  This is the only action placement game that I actually like.  Games like Leonardo Da Vinci, Caylus, Age of Empires III are abysmal compared to this game.  It is really cool how the game changes so much between the family game and between each regular game.  It is a cool feeling of finding your niche among other farmers and seeing your desolated land develop to a prosperous farm.  How a few rounds ago your land is half empty and by the end of the game it is "complete."  Agricola is a great combination of theme and mechanics that fall in the meaty category.  Mind kind of game.

After 45 games I think it is time reward the game a 10.  Even though I have played the game 45 times, I still want to play it back to back to back to back... You get the idea.  This game embodies the 10 rating.  I love playing this game with new players and experienced players a like.  I like the feeling of playing against other people and playing against the game at the same time since you have so little time to do so many things.  Kind of like the same feeling you get from playing Antiquity.  The cards are what make this game so great.  They provide the avenue for the game to become strategic as they give you incentives to follow specific strategic paths.  The cards prevent the game from being a tit-for-tat game and from being a purely tactical game.  Actually, I think the underlying skill needed to play Agricola well is to gauge how much use you can get from the occupations and improvements.  You will find that a lot of the cards are awesome to play but you have to focus on only a few of them or you'll find yourself doing too many things at the same time and thus not getting much use from your awesome cards.  The person that can do this best will win the game.  Additionally, I am happy to report that I haven't played a game where my hand of minor improvements and occupations made me feel like I was doomed.  The game actually moves in a pretty quick pace.  Obviously if you play with AP people then it would take longer.  I typically play 4 player games in under 90 minutes.  Additional to the cards, the game has so much replayability because the game changes character when playing the game with different numbers of players.  For example in 4 player games it is easy to get ovens because there is an action that gives you reed, stone and food.  It is easy to setup a grain food engine.  In contrast with a 2 player game, there is no reed, stone & food action so it takes a bit longer to get the stone for the ovens.  Also, occupations are slower to play in 2 player games compared to 4 player games because in 2 player games there is only 1 occupation action versus 2 in 4 player games.  You really have to reorient yourself when playing the game with different numbers of players.  It is liken to hitting a wall.

I like this game, but after a few plays, I find I don't seem to play it much. I like that the game rewards shrewd, balanced play; you need a bit of everything by game's end lest you lose points - livestock, crops, fences, improved cottage, barn etc. But maybe it funnels/prescribes play a bit too much?! By game's end, everyone's board can look a bit same-y ... kinda like a farm, I guess. 
Where the game shines is in creating great tension in competition for food, resources and action spaces. Each turn, players are faced with some agonising decisions; whether to "grab now" or hold off to reap bigger rewards next turn. 
Playing pieces and boards are lovely, with but one exception: for a game which oozes theme, those ice-hockey puck "people" leave me cold. Meeple people or farmer stickers would have been a nice inclusion. At least those sterile cubes have been replaced my animeeples in more recent versions.
Oh yes, and I can't subscribe to the rule that allows you to house one animal in your cottage. I mean, who wants to live with a sheep?!! Baaaaaa.

Playing against two humans for the first time instead of the AI on the ios version proved rather brutal for me!

It's clearly a great game, put together with incredible care and skill. But it just feels like such hard work playing this game - I'm exhausted afterwards!

edit: having had the opportunity to play this on ios quite a bit now, it is quite brilliant!

Based on only one family game play. Quite enterteining.  Nothing new or original, and a little bit uncomfortable to play due to the enormous amount of cards.  Multiplayer solitaire.  Overproduced, (there is no need to have soooo many cards, nobody will use all of them ever) I had a very good time playing it, but will not buy.

One of the few games my wife will play with me.  This is easier to pick up than it initially seems and the theme is pretty accessible.

Solid. Solid. Solid. Want to play again. and again. The more complex cards we use, the better the fun.
It's worth getting up on a learning curve to explore this game. It has a lot to offer after 3-4 initial plays. It is fun, no matter if we play the family game or the regular game with complex cards I. A great game, still enjoy it after 20+ plays!

I've got 1 4-player, 2 2-player, and a handful of solo games under my belt to this point.  Only the 4-player game has involved anything other than the E-deck.

The base tech-tree engine is great.  The cards, however, put this game over the top.  The endless variety and differing focus generated by the cards gives infinite replay ability and keeps the game from being over analyzed a-la Caylus and Puerto Rico. 

I'm giving this an initial 9, but it may increase.  There's an incredible amount of game in that box.

Only solo or two player games so far.  Can't make my mind up about this.  I'm not desperate to play further games in the same way as with Roads and Boats.

This is the game that got me into tabletop gaming.  Before playing this I hadn't played anything since Dominion years ago.

Even though I didn't fully grasp a viable strategy until round 4 or 5 my first game, and the theme is super dry (unless you're just really into building farms), I lovvve this game.  I love how much thought and strategy goes into everything you do, I love how you can have little on your board but with a few well-timed moves you can come back from behind and build an awesome farm in the later rounds. 

My only complaint is the randomized card mechanism.  I hate randomness, and I don't like getting a crappy hand that's difficult to string together purely based on bad luck.  I haven't played it yet but I imagine I will enjoy the Caverna tile system more.

But that's just me and it's a small concession.  Agricola is awesome!!

Agricola wouldn't need any comment: BGG is so full of words about its awesomeness that mine are surely superfluous.
What is so amazig about it is its tightness, the pressure it puts on players, the constant need of one more action like grasping for air.
The only (perceived) imperfection, card imbalance, vanishes using the drafting variant.

Update february 25, 2009: My GF loves it, so it gets +0.5!
Update july 12, 2009: The more we play, the more we like it with any number of players! It's definitely a 10.
Update july 16, 2010: The GF's love for the game is definitely declining, so it loses 1 point...
Update september 17, 2011: still playing it on a constant basis, why should't it be a 10?

RATING: 8.5
First impression is that it is a very tight game that focuses quite a bit on the ability to provide for the family. Everyone was so obsessed with getting enough food to feed the people that rarely anyone had spare capacity for anything else.

Finally played the game with the occupations and the minor improvements and I must say they improved the gameplay so that there are more options to GET MORE FOOD!

I enjoy the tight game where you have to do a lot of trade offs. Same as this world, there are tons of opportunity costs, when you do one thing you cannot do another.

Will be incorporating the other decks and the expansions next.

 During my first play through, I noticed that 24 of the game cards have manufacturing defects. It is an obvious score line right across the top 9mm of the affected cards. I have contacted the publisher (Z-man Games) to replace these cards or to find another suitable solution. I've removed my initial rating of the game until this matter is resolved.

Update Oct 02 2013
 I received the replacement cards today and 18 of the 24 replacement cards have the SAME score line manufacturing error in them! In some cases it's even worse! I have contacted Z-man customer service again through email regarding this on going issue.

Update Oct 03 2013
 I received a very prompt response from Z-man. They have apologised for their errors and are sending undamaged replacement cards immediately. It would seem that there have been some significant manufacturing and worker
 related issues at Z-man in the last while. I was not the only one who was affected by poor quality parts and service.

Update Oct 08 2013
  I received my undamaged replacement cards and 3 "bonus" cards. I have a proper Agricola set now :)

one of the few drawbacks is the most annoying turn order mechanic. in family version I will always use the caylus-style variant unless someone at the table strongly refuses.

I'm a little late to the Agricola party.  Experienced reviewers made me hesitant to pick up a copy and the general consensus in my gaming group is unfavorable.


I played a "family version" with my wife this afternoon and I LOVE this game. The worker placement was tight and the number of strategies were multi-varied and interesting. Our final score was 32-33 so it was really we'll balanced. For 2 first time players with the same amount of gaming experience we really should be scoring nearly the same and we did.

UPDATE: I included this game in my 10x10 - 2015 gaming challenge and I'm really glad I did. There is still so much to this game I haven't discovered and yet I never would have guessed that from my first plays. The cards are ESSENTIAL to really getting the most out of play. Really, they are everything. I love this game.

First play : the game seems to be promising, but we made a lot of tactical mistakes. So I have to play it some more to give it a definitive score. One thing's for sure : you always have hard decisions to make. It seems to me that having a big family in the beginning is important, but then you have troubles feeding them.
Second play : this game is really good, very different because of different cards, still hard decisions to make. The score has already gone up. Probably becoming a 10. 
Some plays later : And now it is a 10.

Agricola is a strong game that stays daring through many plays. Always different, always exciting.

I only played one time a few years ago. I didn't quite have the attention span or patience for this game, either because it is too complicated or I was trounced by my brother and his BIL. I do want to play it again since its been a year+, but I'd need to do a couple trial runs before I really enjoy the game.

This game is enjoyable and I rarely turn down the chance to play. The problem I have with this game though is it seems the game is only won if you expand your family, if you do not you are quickly left behind leaving little to no room to expand your strategy very far from predictable.

I've played this game half a dozen times now and there's still lots more to learn. I can at least teach the basic rules now. I'm getting a better handle on strategy. Still haven't played with minor improvements or occupations. So, lots to learn. Well worth buying in this case.

After playing this game more than 30 times i have come to the conclusion that it's a good game but not nearly as good as is rated on BGG.  

Drafting is the only way to fix the balance issues and still certain cards are just way to good.  You also should really play with the expansion to make sure people have a decent chance of not getting entirely screwed each turn.

I don't like it. At the gates of Loyang, and Le Havre are much better games. In this one you are by your own and you can do few things to interact. I was hoping much more when I did bought it and first played.

RATING: 9.5
This is the favorite game of my girlfriend. Though I like it, it does not wow me. But I think it is a very solid game. I came to upgrade the rating from 7, to 8 and now to 8.75. The only thing it doesn't attract me is the theme. It is a farming game. We are still playing with easy cards, so I expect the experience to improve when playing with Komplex deck. 
However I got to a stage when I enjoy the game considerably, and I wish I had more time to play it. I just have other games that I "need"/ enjoy more to play. From my collection, Agricola would be Nr.3, for my girlfriend is Nr.1.


Update 1: After Komplex Deck and another 14 sessions of gaming in 2 weeks, this is a 9.25 game.Wonderful. 
Update 2: Let's be serious. This game is aaaawesome.  I play it , and I play it, and I keep playing it. Just love it.

RATING: 9
Currently my #1 favorite game.  I enjoy all aspects of it.  I play a lot solo, and love the puzzle-like aspect of Solo Agricola.  I've even found myself with a pen and paper planning out several rounds beforehand for many solo series.

Multiplayer feels like a completely different game, trying to time resource/action space grabs perfectly, oftentimes blocking or being thwarted by an opponent.

The hundreds of occupations and minor improvements keep the advanced game fresh every time, and I love the tactile addition of lots of wooden bits!

Agricola is similar to Caylus, but with random player cards that are kept secret until played.  The positive thing about the random distribution of Occupation and Minor Improvement cards is that it almost forces you to try out new approaches and tactics for each session.  There are balance issues in which players may potentially get better card combinations than others.  However, the draft variant allows for a more balanced, customizable game.  I prefer playing Agricola with a draft, but I'd only do this with experienced players. I also am a little concerned about how much study time is necessary for new players to become familiar with all of the cards.   Another concern is that the start player mechanic is better handled in Caylus.

The special actions are awesome.  They make it easier for players with less family members to stay competitive.  Timing your actions is crucial, especially since each special action may be selected twice per round.  Overall, I find the action phase to be more dynamic than standard Agricola.  Each new feature provides so many alternative ways to combo and score points that you don't even need to play with Occupations.

This is close to the perfect game- strongly thematic, scalable from 1-5 players, and with varying levels of complexity providing a challenge to gamers of different skills. I enjoy playing the family game, specially with Farmers of the Moor, with less intense gamers. My favorite though is playing the full game, picking a deck, and drafting the minor improvements and occupations. I'm not specially good at this but I love the challenge. Oh and having the pressure of needing to feed your family is one of the best parts.

Agricola is a well-made game with sturdy, aesthetically pleasing components and great replay value. The issue I have is that it rarely hits the table because of the brain-focus required to play. You have to be fresh to get into this game and confront the vast number of options available to assist you in pursuit of a vast number of potential avenues to win. A great game in specific situations.

Okay, so I've probably got the record for lowest-ever scoring on a learning game (-15, yikes!).  I think, however, my instructor didn't teach/I didn't catch on optimally.  I also didn't find the game terribly interesting, for some reason, which is too bad, since I'd been excited about trying it out for a while.  I might give it another go someday when I've a more experienced tutor on hand, and more than two players.

Played one game solo to get the rules and then played a 2-player game against my wife.

I felt way too constrained by the fact that you need to feed your people, and thus barely got to build up anything.

Furthermore I found the game to be very fiddly and cumbersome with all those resource tokens that you have to add onto the fields each round.

This is my first time to comment, This is the most over rated game I have played. I love worker placement games and own quite a few this was just weak. I play on two player the game is over just as I start getting into it, there is no planning to be done, it is just one boring task and very linear. I was really looking forward to this game I enjoy many games this is the only game I have been dispointed in enough to write about. Also the rules are terrible it is like a 12 years old written them. The only positive I can say is that it may be a good starter for introducing children to real worker placement games suck as stone age, tzolkin etc. DULL

RATING: 7
LIKES - Analyzing occupation and minor improvement cards for combos that will help your worker placement efficiency.  Oddly enough - the theme (I have tons of sheep; You have none - (diabolic laugher)).

DISLIKES - Winning feels anticlimactic.  (What, I just won a game of Agricola.  I should feel more excited).

WHY A 7.5 RATING BASED ON THE BGG DEFINITIONS? - This is a "very good" game (9), but I would be apt to "probably suggest" it depending on the make up of the game group (8), however I don't think I would "never" turn down a game (8).  There are other games out there I would rather play therefore Agricola gets a 7.5.

Well, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the buzz was about.  A buddy got it before the holiday rush, so was able to play in November.  Of course, the first time you play this offering you don't have a clue what is going to work so your strategy is pretty openended, but it was still a loadful of fun.  Received it as a Christmas gift and found that playing the solitaire version a few times really helped me get a better grasp on best strategies, familiarize myself with the cards, and gave me a better appreciation of some of the nuances the game provides.  I look forward to playing this more.  [Gift]

You'll never have enough actions to do everything you want, but all you need is more than everyone else.  Agricola, the game that takes farming to a nail-biting new level.  The more people you play with, the more difficult it gets so it becomes truly a race to what is needed.

I've gotten into a bit of a rut in strategy always going for a 2 room extension from the start.  Of course this is a good way to go, but I've been completely screwed over by people that mix it up a bit (especially if someone focuses on taking animals early).  Despite this, the cards always add interesting choices from the beginning.  I like this game the most with 3 players -- more than that simply takes too long.  I also like to play at least a couple of games at a time to make the set-up and tear-down times more worth while.

IMO: Agricola feels like Bohnanza filtered through Martin Wallace.  This is after 1 play with just minor improvements and occupations.  We played a 3 player game and I really didn't find it fun.  It just felt like a simulation that forgot it was a simulation and glossed over bits that weren't interesting.  Case in point: I have a child on a stage.  Each stage representing 1 year as far as I can tell.  Now in the next stage I can send that child to work for me?  But he or she is only 1 year old or less.  How the heck is a 1 year old going to go fishing or collect cattle or build a room on to the house?  Seriously, if you're going to simulate life on the farm simulate the whole thing.

The score is based off of one 5 player game.


I've only yet played it once and alot of the time went into translating the German rules aswell as looking up and remembering each of the 14 action cards. This proved a hard task and it definitely will improve when played for a second time and are more familiar with all the conditions for scoring.

Played 5 times in one weekend when I first got it. What an amazing game. I was fascinated by the interactions of the cards, the new opportunities that presented themselves in each game, and the way the whole game played. A gaming masterpiece that any fan of meaty games will enjoy. 

[q]- What do you like the most about Agricola?[/q]
The game combines a strategic plan with tactical choices very well. It offers immense replayability and you must react to your opponents plays, and their perceived strategy at all times to do well. It rewards good planning and deep involvement. All this while having a fun, different theme, and cute little animeeples.

[q]- Do you think you'll be playing much more of it in the future?[/q]
I expect to be playing this for some time, though my plays of it have recently tapered off. I hope they pick up again soon as i devote less of my gaming time to playtesting Dominion.

[q]- Why do you think this game is so replayable?  In other words, what keeps you from getting bored with it after so many plays?[/q]
The sheer variety of possible hands, and the adjustment to your overall strategy that each hand will require makes each play slightly different.

Love this, but I'd much rather play it with the minor improvements and occupations.  The Family version is just too simple. Now, just to be contrarian, I've only played with the standard decks because it's still a matter of getting enough people to learn the game (different crowd every time - rather get the mechanics down before all of the subtleties of the cards come into play).

It's definitely a good game, I tired of it after a while; however.  Not sure why, i love worker placement, and building my own little empire.  I guess I just wasn't having "fun" playing it.  Sac religious I know.

(3-5 Players, 30 min/player, CLASSIC) As a subsistence farmer in the Middle Ages, hunger is your adversary. With only so many resources and opportunities in your village to go around, every member of your household must spend their time wisely. Plow your fields, plant crops, raise livestock, and improve your home (with a family) to become the best farmer in town.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have trouble [i]enjoying[/i] this game as much as other games, but I still have some desire to play more in order to try new cards, new strategies, etc. However, I have to say that most of my desire to play comes from wanting to see new cards and try to make them work rather than from a genuine enjoyment of the game – more curiosity than pleasure.

I find the scoring at the end to be a bit of a downer. Needing to use a spreadsheet to add up scores takes a bit away from the fun of the game (counting up points is one thing; tallying them in a dedicated spreadsheet feels like I'm back in the office).  In addition, the need for balance combined with the limited number of rounds really makes the game feel too short and too constrained.  Due to the way the scoring works, it's almost always more profitable to spend a fair number of my limited actions getting one or two of everything, no matter what specialization (if any) I may (want to) have. I end most games feeling like I didn't have time to really accomplish anything (especially when attempting to harvest crops) and feeling like too many of my actions were scripted, which is more than a bit frustrating. 

While the game provides a good 'feel' for the difficulty of surviving as a Middle Ages farmer, I find the fact that the mechanics force me into being a sheep/cow/boar/wheat/vegetable farmer with a family and upgraded house slightly off-putting. There is (seemingly) no opportunity to specialize, which cuts back on the realism and makes for a less enjoyable experience than, e.g., Puerto Rico, where I feel that I really have a choice in how I play the game. Additionally, at the end of Puerto Rico, I feel like I accomplished something, even if I lost. Perhaps I tried a shipping strategy, so I focused on a couple crops and tried to buy a wharf. Or perhaps I tried a building strategy and focused on cash and construction over shipping. But at least I can say "I tried to do X/Y/Z and succeeded/failed". In Agricola, every game feels the same: "I tried to do some of everything".

Overall, I quite like Agricola's theme and think it does a great job of depicting the struggle of surviving as a subsistence farmer in the Middle Ages. However, I find the gameplay lacking in a few areas, and while I will not refuse to play, I'd almost always rather play something else.

Perhaps an interesting addition could be a 'Market' mechanism: you place a worker on the Market and can sell or buy goods at market (i.e., trading with the local townsfolk). Each good would have a different purchase/sale price (e.g., a sheep would sell for less than a boar, but would require less money to purchase as well). It wouldn't fix everything I dislike about the game, but it could perhaps add a bit of flexibility and interest. I also wonder if some balance would be added by changing the family growth action (at least the first one) from an action one must take in order to have a child to a different action space (e.g., 3 clay) with a disclaimer that when that action space comes into play, each player immediately has a child that can be used that round (or the next). Perhaps it would have to be at the start of a round in order to facilitate 'family planning' but it might remove some of the (illogical – the Smiths had a baby, so I can't) competition for obtaining more actions. (2012-01)

Traded for Settlers of Catan (3e), as Settlers has a better chance of getting played with my group of friends, and there are a number of games I'd prefer to Agricola at any rate. I'd still be willing to play now and then, but don't need to own a copy. (2012-03)

Some additional musings: 

Regarding the mandatory 'diversity' in scoring, the timing of actions that allow more flexibility in growing one's farm, the replenishment rates of wood/animals/etc. vs. grain/vegetables, etc., I strongly agree with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/3351125#3351125]this comment[/url]: [i][Agricola] seems to be built of artificial balancing, rather than having a few bits of artificial balancing bolted to tweak the power of various actions or reign in the leader.[/i] The end-game scoring seems to be a product of this same approach: instead of working the game out in such a way that collecting a single kind of VP is balanced (e.g., in Puerto Rico, players collect a single [i]kind[/i] of VP though through different means), Agricola seemingly takes the approach of correcting a potentially overpowered strategy X by forcing [i]all[/i] players to play strategies X, Y, and Z in every game. 

Another aspect of Agricola that doesn't sit well with me is the fact that the game itself is an opponent -- in some ways, perhaps the [i]main[/i] opponent. The game sets fairly strict requirements that each player has to meet (or else risk losing not because another player beat you, but because you failed to meet the game's requirements -- which, naturally, the other players get some degree of credit for, but it's not quite the same), which diverts the primary focus from competing with other players to meeting the requirements of the game system. More on this idea [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/3350325#3350325]here[/url]. The fact that one can play Agricola [i]alone[/i] is indicative of this problem in my mind: if the game is enough of a challenge on one's own, why add other players? So all can fight against the game simultaneously, while also trying to make it more difficult for each other to do so? This reminds me of racing canoes [i]upstream[/i], where the other racers try to sabotage your efforts to simply move forward. It certainly is competitive, but is [i]so[/i] cut-throat (and demanding enough on its own) that it doesn't allow for the same type of competition as, say, Tigris and Euphrates, Puerto Rico, Chess, and so forth.

Rating improved to a 9.0: So much going on and so much to consider with your own hand let alone keeping up with what others are doing. The deal of the cards absolutely steers where you drive your strategy and ensures no two games are the same. The first game is a learning experience both for the rules and approach. Always more to do than you can achieve, what a frustratingly beautiful game.

Now played with 2,4 and 5 players, the game seems to scale perfectly. Relatively straight forward to explain to new comers and always an extremely positive reaction. This game has staying power and has now been lodged in my top ten.

Wow - there is a lot going on in this game. Just started to scratch the surface in our first play. It feels fast for a longer game. Highly replayable. I won't be suprised if it takes the top ranking when released in the US. A big time gamer game that is more fun that P.R. 

Update: The US release was huge. It look #1 within a week. I finally picked up a copy at a local convention. This is the only game I would play solo, I enjoy it that much. 

The cards are what make the game. They completely change your strategy from game to game. Creating enough food can be a real challenge depending on the strategy you pick, so I find myself trying new things all the time. I don't mind losing this game, and that is rare!

This game has some real nice parts to it but I just have never really enjoyed playing it all that much. The card system, which *should* be something I like, often seems it can win you the game if you manage the right combos. Every game feels too "samey" which I don't like too weather it's building your food engine early or always making sure you hit all the check boxes on things in your farm. Get some pigs...but no need to get too many. Make sure you have grains and vegetables too! And cover all those squares!

RATING: 7.5
The comment that I seem to make most while playing this game is 'This game is hard!' There's too much stuff I want to do, not enough family members to do them with, and the other players always seem to put their guys on the spaces that I need.

But that's what makes it so fun! Our games tend to take a long time (2-2.5 hours for 3 players). But we understand when someone is taking an especially long time in this game. Some of the choices can be pretty hard!

It's also kind of fun to look at your nice little farm after the game is over.

Something that I don't like about this game is that it takes up a ton of room and takes a while to set up and take down. It's not that big of a deal, but it's something you have to take into account if you only have a certain amount of time to play.

Pros - Great replayability, especially with the advanced rules.  Lots of interactivity with other players through competition for actions.  Great mechanics that follow the theme well.

Cons - Games can take upwards from 2 hours depending on the number of players and how quickly you can setup.  Complex rules.  Casual gamers can learn it, but will take them long to master the rules.  Not recommended for beginners.

Played three times in two weeks. Finally can rate this game. Game design is super well done. Theme is on point. Takes many plays to be good at. Very high replaybility.  The cards are where this game is at.  However, the only reason this game probably won’t be my favourite game is the feeling of struggling. I don’t mind feeding my people.  But this is just too tight. When you finally have an engine going, the game is already at its last round. Also, I don’t get why you have to have a bit of everything to not get deduction. I get it’s a way to balance between the players though. Overall, I really like the game, but it’s probably not my top 10. I look forward to play more once in a while.

Wow, Agricola is a really good game! I'm disappointed I took so long to play it. Lots of decision making and near infinite replayability with the different decks of occupation and minor improvement cards. The only possible drawback I could say about Agricola is that it does take a long time to set up (and break down for that matter). High score so far: 38 in 1 3 player game with the basic starter deck. And I came in 2nd place (roommate was winner with 50pts!!) New high score: 44 in a 3 player with E and O deck.

Upgraded to a 10 at long last. With all the cards available, AND with the SoloPlay #7 expansion/variant for resources that allows you to play with almost every occupation when playing solo, I love this game.

12/08 Initial plays-a deep game with much replayability.  Everyone has had fun with this one-even my 8 year old niece, who picked it up quickly-she's a smart boardgamer.  In teaching, I try to emphasize a 'cooperative' style of gaming.  Everyone helps to maximize their own score, trying to improve upon their own previous scores.  In other words-help them to see all possibilities.

RATING: 6
There is a lot to like about this game.  It has a ton of strategy and decision making.  I like the theme with the development of early modern life and all of its complexities.  Best of all, the game can be scaled by complexity.  This makes it possible for very nuanced games with lots of cards and interactivity or the simple core game with farm building.  In that sense, it is wonderful because it scales easily all the way from a kid's game to a gamer's game.  Few games can make this claim.
UPDATE:  Reduced score.  Maybe I'm just getting tired of these optimal resource games.

German & English version

My number two game.  Bought and played the german version with friends wanting to all learn german and then bought english version so I could also play with normal play group.  My favorite game at present by quite some margin.  

Cannot recall ever having two identical hands.

Thought that occupations were the awesomeness of this game and yet the farmers of the moor expansion without occs is arguably even more enjoyable.

Plays fantastically whether 2-5 players and even 5 new players can play in 3 hours (significanly less if less players and more experienced)

Another great game that I was late to pick up (well, the box weighs a ton) but one that I'm glad I finally did.

Worker placement game that is not so exciting...
You can play alone to build yourself a nice little farm and raise animals and grow crops... Or you can play against others and do the same thing except that resources are sometimes unavailable.

Fortunately, I was not expecting much after all the hype from BGG, so I was pleasantly surprised by this. It doesn't deserve to be #1 in my opinion, but I like it better than Puerto Rico (which also did not deserver to be #1, in my opinion). 

My main complaint, which is a frequent complaint with Euros, is that it felt like there just were not enough turns (actions) to do everything I wanted to do. I just started getting my animals going in the pasture, and then it was over. 

I did like having to diversify.  I suppose that could "limit" strategy choices as I play a few more games, but I felt it made the game more challenging by forcing all players to compete for all goods.  The cards seem to be what makes the game "different" each time, and I've yet to play enough to see if any are truly overpowered as some claim.  However, I doubt I'd enjoy the "family" version of the game.  Without the cards, it seems this game would get very dull very quick.

After 3 games:  It seems that the cards are not well balanced in this at all.  Now that I know the cards better, the winner can almost be pre-determined just by looking at what cards each person was dealt.  I probably would rate this a 7 or maybe an 8 but for this defect.

You know how good this game is. Hell, it's number 1 in the charts.
I love it for it's diversity of choice for where to place your family members and the various strategies to victory. 
However, the cards are not balanced and players can definitely get a leg up on the competition if dealt good cards. Also analysis paralysis tends to stall this game to hideous lengths with 5 players.

1 play with the family deck:  

It was everything they say it is.  So many good decisions, so many better ones.  

I really liked my experience with it, however, it's a heckuva game to play.  ..and you don't step-up to the 'gric without being ready to play...  So it doesn't make my "never turn down a game", but I think it rightfully deserves the place it's at on boardgamegeek at #1, as it is a very excellent game.

What's nice about this, is that it wasn't dry because there was so much you could do on any given turn...


Some comments sometime later:

I got a new job, and I can't really muster-up what it takes to want to play this game.  It's the weirdest thing.  

The one thing I solidly have against this game, is that while it's kind of fun, it's brain-burny fun...  and when I say 'fun' I mean "not 110% strategic".  There's just so so so so very much going on with this game that I have a hard time believing there are many folks that know what they want to do and what they are doing, even after like the 10th game they've played.  Almost boils it down to being a fun exercise.  The problem is, it's really really hard to explain to people.  There's a lot of tacit knowledge here...  like that you have to plow a field to use it to grow veggies, and what converts to food and what doesn't...  and...  I don't know.  I have to opt for le havre as my economic game of choice out of the rosenburg series.

Agricola is a very good Euro game with a strong focus on "getting everything done before the end". What I mean by this phrase is that a player has to have various elements, such as animals and crops, in his/her farm by the end of the game. Failure to have certain elements will remove points from the player's score.

This is not necessarily a bad thing as the game stays away from being too linear. There are multiple avenues to get what you need, and, for me, the fun lies in developing a particular timing strategy with the 7 minor improvement cards and 7 occupations cards one gets in the beginning.

Overall, Agricola is a fun and rewarding, but also stressful game at times. Getting enough food to feed your family at the harvest while at the same time developing your farm is challenging and is the key to victory.

A mind boggling worker placement game and the only worker placement that can challenge Caylus. However, Agricola has a bit too many things going on, so it is difficult to teach and very difficult to play well in the first time. Luckily most of the workings are logical. So I feel it is very heavy but that also makes me want to try again and again to finally master this game that was once the #1 in BGG overall rating.

What can you say about Agricola that hasn't been said? It is starting to show its age though, and (dare I say it?) better games have come along.

I love this game.  It's a theme-heavy worker placement and resource management Euro where to goal is to see who can get their family the best quality of life.  Yes, some people find a game based on medieval farming inherently dull, but I prefer to think of the theme as "Not Starving To Death."

The occupations and minor improvements add a ton of replay value, but their sometimes poor balance adds an element of luck that's a bit too strong.  And after a few playthroughs, your best choices for optimizing your farm space become pretty obvious (though the excellent "Farmers on the Moor" expansion does a lot to mitigate that).

Still.  I love the tension that comes from hustling to keep my family fed, or from the rat bastard next to me stealing that big pile of wood RIGHT before I was going to nab it.  This is a great game.

Absolutely fantastic game.  I really don't think I've played anything better.  There are a couple that are as good, but nothing better.  After a couple more plays, I'm finding the game less impressive.  Still great, but not the best.  Especially after playing Race for the Galaxy and also finding that Dominion has held up so well to multiple plays.

Oh my god, this really is a great game. The weight of the decisions that have to be made each turn is unbelievable. The number of possible roads to victory is shear unlimited. The density of the game experience is great, how they did get so much game in so little time is amazing. Add to that the different ways to play the game with the family version and the different card packs. Also the measures taken to ensure a balanced playing experience for different numbers of players is well above avarage, you can even play solo! A truly great game!

RATING: 4
To be fair I've only played one game and that was simply the "family" version.  However, I really don't think this game is for me.  I just don't understand where the fun in the game comes from.  The most frustrating part for me is probably the feel that I'm always trying to dig myself out of a hole, in an effort to get enough food to feed my people.  I never could get over the hump and had no idea how it was possible.  I'm sure with multiple plays that would become obvious, but for a first timer it's just irritating.  It feels too much like the financial struggles I deal with in real life, and the boring farmer theme doesn't help in that matter.

Another thing that I didn't like is the forced diversity.  The fact that the game basically demands that you focus on every area, trying unique strategies seems difficult.  And, finally, I don't like the fact that they just plop 25+ options in front of you and expect you to have some clue what is worthwhile.  I'm OK with games that have a learning curve, but when it's so steep that experiences players can triple the score of a new player it's just not fun for me.  I wouldn't refuse a game in the future, but I'm certainly not going to seek it out.

8-17-08.  After 11 plays, this is becoming more solidified in its 10-ness for me.  I used to be worried more about the cards, but learning how they are interacting is qualming some of my fears.  May still change in the future.

9-15-08.  I just really enjoy this game.

9-29-08.  The game has started to lose some of its charm after 22 games.  Still solid, but I can see this being harder and harder to want to pull out, particularly with the Essen season coming.

11-06-08.  I've gotten my enjoyment out of it, but the game is simply not that strong in the end.  There are some varying levels of complex mechanisms, but ultimately I think the randomness of the card hands take away too much for me.  4 players is probably the max I'll play this with again, and sit out of a five-player.  3 players is the sweet spot.

Why is Agricola as popular as it is? Well it has got:

- Variable setup due to the cards ensures endless replayability.
- Competition for spaces (typical for worker placement games).
- Tension from having to feed your workers (a tension which is sometimes lacking from other euros).

On top of that, it is just really tightly designed. To me, it didn't need a fix at all and I refuse to regard Caverna as a fix, rather it is a more casual alternative, despite arguably being more complex.

I think this is one of those games that gets better the more you play it and I certainly haven't played it enough yet to fully grasp it.

I have played it with two, three, four and five players.  I like it, especially because it plays so well no matter the number of players.  2, 3, 4 player games are best as 5 can get a bit long.  I feel like the cards do provide advantages to certain players depending on how they are dealt out.  It's just hard to know how much, or if, the cards determine the players' final standings.

While I like the game, I am not infatuated with it and many of the people I game with are infatuated with it.  I'd prefer to play this once in a while and play a bit more variety.  I've noticed that my family members are especially hooked on this game.

UPDATE: After 27 plays, I've decided that this is just a "good game that I am usually willing to play."  Now, when people ask to play it I will, but I'll suggest something else first.  I've traded it away because I rarely play it and, when I do, I am always playing somebody else's copy.

Great game. At first an intimidating amount of cards and pieces, there are 10 different resources in the game, wood, clay, reed, stone, grain, vegetables, sheep, boar, cattle and food. Despite the complexity, it plays quite nice and our group has become quite obsessed with it.
You will need a ping pong table for five players.

Many small, stressful decisions made with imperfect knowledge.  Lowering this a little after a couple more plays.  The theme just doesn't grab me, and the complexity feels a little unnecessary.

At the start of each game I figure I'm just going to concentrate on the basics of feeding and developing my farm and not get distracted, but then I get a hand of cards with amazing possibilities, and suddenly I'm diverting resources into complex card combos which will then be used 10 turns later to get me enough materials to do something else... and before I know it I'm scrambling to make it to the end of the game, all the while competing with my opponents for scarce resources. This game is involving, frustrating and always leaves me wanting to play again.

Finally got the chance to play it (on a friend's paste-up version), and kept an open mind considering all the hype, all he hubbub, and all of the backlash.  I'm glad I did.  An absolute stunner of a game.  Played twice in two days, 5 player full games, and each time left me wanting to play again.  Engaging, and leaves you wanting to revisit the game and see what else you could have done.  Lots of competition, and you always have to adjust based on what the other players are doing, so you never feel like you're playing in a void.  Even better, the extra occupatios and minor improvements merely added to the strategy and nudged you along, rather than provided game-breaking powerplays.  At no time did I look at somebody else's cards and say "oh, I would've won if I had that", but I always looked at somebody else's cards and said "Oh cool!  I wonder what I would've done if I'd had that!?"  Admittedly I scored fairly well in both games, but even the low-scorers were engaged and happy to have played, and merely want to better their score next time.

Provisional rating based on one 5-p game with the E-deck.

Pretty good worker-placement game.  I think the starting card deal introduces a bit more randomness than I'd like in a game with such a long play-time.  Perhaps one of the variants which reduces the variance of the initial deal will be more to my liking, though I will certainly play multiple times with each of the included decks to become much more familiar with the game before making a final decision.

Edit:  Still have only played this once but wanted to also mention that it's certainly possible that the cards might be balanced well enough that the random card draw just isn't as important to the outcome as I suspect it might be.

This is a hit for me! 

Honestly, I really had trouble caring much for the theme...But once I finally started a game I fell in love with it, and now have this intense craving for new Euro games

There's an ever present threat of starvation happening to your family which is great for me because I love games in which it feels like an ongoing struggle to survive (ghost stories for example). And then on top of that, this game has a TON of variation when playing with the hands of occupation and improvement cards that forces you to change your strategy.

Sometimes you may realize you've messed up and end up crashing and burning, but never have I felt like a particular game was hopeless due to my hand - I just didn't play cards or gather resources at the right time

But in other times you excel at feeding everyone ever, build yourself a stone house and have loads of farm land. It's a REAL joy to see your engine working so well

** After 5+ more multiplayer sessions**

Bumping it up to a 9 - everyone that's tried it in my experience has loved it and working around the other player's resource gathering adds another depth of complexity I really enjoy. It's also a really nice breather from games that allow you to directly crush your enemies - so this game gets worked into our rotation regularly

So many choices, yet so little in the way of resources (and so many types of resources) to play with. Nothing but difficult decisions. You really need to think through a strategy based on your cards and yet also be opportunistic when you can and be prepared to rethink when somebody else takes an item or an action you want. Masses of replayability and very deep.

Now into double figures played and still not tired of it, still look forward to pulling the game out, would still play this in preference to most other games.

RATING: 5
To my taste, all the eurogames look (and feel) the same: even Agricola does, despite it being so highly ranked and rated by many. Like any other eurogame, it’s a multiplayer solitaire whose focus is on resource management: the theme itself is just a wrapping stuck onto their precious rulesystem and not a jointly-developed part of it. Therefore, all you can do all the time is to meditate on your next move, worry because the player before you just took the same action you wanted to, find an alternative move quickly and be content with what little it gives you, before falling into the realm of boredom again until your next turn is up.

«Be content» could be the eurogames’ motto: it fits Agricola even better, because you will never be fully satisfied by your playing it. I know eurogames take pride from their cold and uninspiring wooden bits, so when playing Agricola I can accept the big discs standing for people. I can also accept the smaller and differently colored discs standing for resources. I could even accept the usual refrain about «strategy» being an eurogame’s core, as though any other category were strategy-free: I can’t stand a game though that punishes its players for playing like Agricola does.
But it’s just a matter of being content.

Don't believe the hype.  The game itself is a solid effort, but ultimately it's a fatally flawed design.  The final scoring makes it so that every player must diversify and do a little bit of everything.  This leads to scripted play and a false sense of competition over the same few resources.  There are better worker placement games.  Agricola is too tightly designed for it's own good.  Figuring out it's puzzle isn't worth the time investment.

[with Z-man deck, from Tanga]
I love this game. I've played with 1, 2, 3, and 5 players so far. All work great. I love Caylus but hate it with 5, but Agricola works great with more. The addition of more action cards with more players really keeps the play balanced and keeps the feel the same. The only difference is that the First Player action becomes more and more important as the number of players grows.

The solo game is great, too. It's different in that it's more like puzzle, because you know that no one's going to take the actions that you need. However, trying to time everything just right--especially when you don't know what actions are coming up (I keep the action cards randomized, like normal, and I took random minor improvements and occupations, too). So, it's different, but it's still a great option if you need an Agricola fix but there's no one else around to play with.

I do think that I prefer the Family Game with more players, though. I found the cards to be interesting and challenging in the solo game, but I find them to be distracting and too slow in the multi-player game (only played with them with 5 players so far, though). I love the tension of the game when no one has an advantage in certain areas based on the cards' customization of their abilities. Read the play notes on my logged play of 8/27/2008 for my initial thoughts on the cards.

UPDATE: Have played with cards two more times, both with 3 players. The second time I didn't like it, either, because the deal was really unbalanced. The third time, we did a draft and it was better. I'll play with them again, but I can't say that I love them.

UPDATE 2: Fine, I like the cards. Having played 20 times now, it's nice to mix it up with the cards.

-don't like the pressure of having to feed the family on a regular basis
-don't like the absolute choice denial mechanism that can really mess you up: since you need to do certain basic actions early in the game to ensure long-term success, being blocked is oftentimes fatal

I really like how the cards you receive alter your grand strategy, but that can get thrown out the window if there are 12 wood sitting on the woodcutter! So tight, in that there are never enough actions to do what you want. Anyone who claims multi-player solitaire has not had the one action they have to have to feed their family taken just before them. Tons of replay.

Deserving of its rank, I think. Not a 10 for me, cause of the imperfect balance of the cards, but it it so fun, and you get dealt so many cards, that I can overlook that.

RATING: 7
Rating based on the solo game and 2-player family games, plus 1.5 games with five players.  The card thing doesn't do much for me; it always seems I get a weird mix of cards that do not compliment each other in any way, so I'd rather just ignore them.  I do enjoy the family game so far.

The main thing I like about the game is its scope.  I'm not some architect assigning workers to build different parts of a castle or cathedral, with the hope of pleasing some faceless king.  That means absolutely nothing to me.  The scope of this game is narrower and more believable, and so is easier to insert myself into.

Of course the game is good too.  Could be frustrating with many players though.

Love it! My favourite game to date. Must have played in excess of 100 games with my wife and it still feels fresh with loads of possible options. Also when playing with 3, 4 or 5, while the core mechanic remains, the game is totally different, although just as much fun. Everyone I've introduced this game to has loved it and a copy has even been taken out to Dubai (from the UK) with one of my friends after a 2 game session.

Can't recommend it enough.

This is a very beautiful game with high-quality components but I just can't understand why it's as highly-rated as it is. My feeling is that people are rating it a 10 because they LOOOOOVE IT OMG rather than because it's actually an exceptional game. I almost gave it a 1 just to try and drag the rating down a bit. [EDIT: I'm glad I didn't, given how that sort of ridiculous behaviour has affected the PR/Agricola/TS battle over the last week - stupidity!]

It is a very good game - It's got some great features - I really like the way it rewards diversification and I love the way everything clicks into place in the last few turns if you've played it right. On the other hand, you ALWAYS wind up clicking into place in exactly the same way. I would be better disposed towards this game if I could choose my own strategy, prefereably based around some sort of specialisation.

I'm not entirely sure the decks of cards add a whole lot, either, as some are game-breaking and some are only good in the right context of other cards. I will say that I don't get the criticism that it's multiplayer solitaire. People who argue that have just missed the point.

My biggest problem with the game is the hyper-scarcity of resources in the first few turns. I also strongly dislike the tension as you wait for your friend to finish so you can finally plan your turn out with whatever spaces are reamining. This game is one of the most prone to Analysis Paralysis and it becomes unbearable with two AP'ed players. The lockout by worker placement mechanic induces the wrong sort of tension in me - anxiety. The game is also just dreadful with two players, as it ratchets up the hyper-scarcity problem, especially for wood.

Ultimately, everything this game does, other games do better.  Race for the Galaxy also feels like it ends just as your engine starts ticking over, but you can specialise. Twilight Struggle also has cards that can only be played once, but you'll see them all and the combos are somewhat reliable, given enough plays. Overall, I'll almost always pass up Agricola for four or five plays of something shorter, or a play of something more rewarding.

NOTE: I have played five or six times, with from 2-5 players.

Squeezes a complex depth of tactical decision into a self-limiting game design.  I love the game's complexity, richness, and ability to customize the experience through various decks or professions and minor improvements.  This game sets the bar as far as I am concerned.

It's a pretty good game solo, for that I would give it a 7. With two, I'd give it an 8.  It took a little bit of effort and some back and forth in the instructions to get going, but by the end of my solo game, it was moving along nicely. 

It becomes tense as you build your farm and work to keep your family fed.  When you work it correctly, it's not difficult to keep the family fed, but to do that, you are using your points for the end of the game.  I do enjoy the wide variety of cards, as they force you into looking at starting each game differently.  

Update:  Played with four, moved it up a point to 8.5 (from 7.5).  More action availabilty, but I think it becomes more tense with more.  The clock starts winding down and you are scrambling to get your farm up to snuff.  

Update: Down to a 7 as it's a good game, but I don't see myself wanting to play it as much anymore.

Update:  6 - Been replaced by Caverna for myself.

RATING: 9.5
Agricola manages to almost single-handedly rescue worker placement games for me. In addition to being wonderfully thematic (even if the theme is farming), it provides multiple paths and has player interaction without being subject (as much) to a one true strategy or a run-away leader problem. Having some of the resource piles grow steadily larger means that the value of certain choices can change, and not in a way you can predict. Occupation and minor improvement cards are what make the game truly shine, however, by introducing a level of personal strategy while still providing room to work within a chosen playstyle. The fact that you can even customize the occupation cards used in a game for a more or less interactive experience is just gravy. It's a brilliant design and the best of Rosenberg's impressive work.

First impressions of this game: strategies are a bit too obvious; everyone has to play predictably. This is mitigated by the fact that there is little interaction between players, much as in other worker placement games. Still, the theme is attractive and you can justifiably control your progression.

What other game lets you bake bread, beg for sustenance, slaughter the family pet, and answers the question of where babies come from (out in the fields)? As far as I know, none. 
That all these things are integrated into an extremely gratifying strategy game that has been streamlined to perfection is just gravy.
I don't think it's as tight a design as Puerto Rico, but it's usually more fun.

Fun game, but there is one thing that really irks me about the game.  The occupation and minor improvement cards.  Was there no objection during playtesting that the vast majority of the cards are not worth playing?  This is actually a far worse predicament than the presence of a few overpowered cards.  

The complete mishandling of the cards are what separates this from a really great game.  Ideally they would have informed your strategic decisions and the challenge would be implementing it through the very tight tactical gameplay of the worker placement.  This would also add some variability to the game that it currently lacks, which was probably the original intent of the cards.

As it is, the game starts to feel very similar between plays.  Combine this with a brutal beginning that winnows down the contenders for victory far too early and we have a game that needed just one more layer of polish.

Nothing else hurts my brain more then a highly competitive game of Agricola. That being said, the game will try to trick you with its pleasant and cute theme.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games for both complexity, difficulty, and replayability. Runs 30 minutes per person

This is a worker placement game where you build up a farm by building structures, growing your family, planting crops, and raising animals. It's one of those games where you want to do everything but can't and it stresses you out. 

A simpler, more beginner friendly version of this game is Caverna (most of the mechanics are exactly the same), which is a better game to start with. Agricola has mechanics that are more challenging, create more competition, and add more replayability, but are harder to learn.

I really enjoy this game but my wife didn't like Agricola the first time we played it so it hasn't hit the table at my place for anything other than a solo game.  I like to play solo now and again but the time it takes to set up, play and put away is more than I have most evenings.  I would really like to play this with some friends and maybe I'll get the wife into it some day. That or when the kids are old enough to play maybe they'll get into this one with dad.  Until then I'll probably hold off on the expansions.  I'd rather have games I can get on the table.

Short version though, I had lots of fun with the game and even solo it had me counting on my fingers and looking at alterate routes to place my workers.

With all the expansions and decks, and with the full rules set yet to explore there is a lot of game here and I recommend it!

I can't wait to get a game in with live people!!

As good as everyone says. Strong theme, tense gameplay where you never have enough time to accomplish everything. Scales well with most numbers of players. Solo play isnt too bad. Cards add some spice/replayability to the mix, but also introduce some imbalance to the gameplay. 

Who doesn't have a little part of themselves that longs to be a quaint farmer?

We purchased Agricola very early in our introduction to the hobby and were overwhelmed. We didn't have great first experiences and put it on the shelf for a long time. We revisited it after becoming much more experienced gamers and could immediately see the genius. Very tight worker placement and a need to do more than you can give this game a great feeling. Uwe has removed this tension from many of his more recent games and those have paled in comparison. This is a classic game that is a perfect representation of why the worker placement mechanic is so wonderful. The Farmer's of the Moor expansion adds some nice twists to make this game even better.

After one play. This seems to have everything I ever enjoyed about heavier Euros like Puerto Rico, Caylus, and Princes of Florence. Like those, it's attractively produced, gets the brain-box working, and let's me play the role of a "planner/manager" for awhile.  However, it's still a baroque "cube-collecting" and point scoring exercise in cardboard and wood. 

The big difference from my experience with a nearly all other euros that I've played before is that I can tell a bit of a "story" about the family whose fortunes and failings I just raised after the game is over. That's a positive change in my book and is more in line with the games with strong narratives that I enjoy so much. However, I'll withhold a rating till I've played a few more times.

RATING: 8
This is the game that started the hobby for me. Great sense of accomplishment after building up your "engine". Base game still feels very fresh even after 6 years and ~50 plays, due to the infinite combos that advance your farm. 2-3-4-5 player games give vastly different experiences, with 2 and 5 very cutthroat while 3-4 are maybe a little friendlier and less resource scarce. Can take a while for beginners to play through, but experienced players would have no problem playing a 5-player game in 3 hours.

I love the boards, i love the meeples and i like the theme... but somehow something was and still is missing for me in this game. The addition of the cards make your decisions even harder and you allways are in the hunt for food for your family... so many to do and so little time... 

I wanted to love the game but right now, for me, the game could not live up to his hype yet. Maybe its because i have only played 2 player games so far. We'll see how it plays with more people.

Update: first two 4 player games tonight. And it seems that this game turns the corner... slowly i get the hang of this game and i feel i am getting better from play to play. Definately a good sign.

1st game was rough.  Learning curve is very large since there are ~200 different cards in the game, and it's hard to figure out how things are inter-connected.  It's a game of resource management and hand management.  Lots of luck in the occupation and minor improvment cards that you are dealt at the beginning... but these are the only cards that you get for the entire game so you must use them wisely (so there's a good bit of strategy).  It's neat to know the full potential of your "clan" instead of drawing cards during the game.  I want to play again soon to fix some 1st game strategy mistakes.

Crap, the hype is right. And here I thought we'd get out of 2008 without finding a "must buy". After the disaster of buying Caylus unseen and unplayed based on the hype, I refused to buy this until we had tried it. Finally played a five-player game with a friend's copy on New Year's Eve 2008 to try it out. What a great game!

I bought the English edition on preorder and this is one of my most played games. There's immense replayability here due to the number of occupation and minor improvement cards (you only have 7 of each at the start of a game). There's also a number of different decks. The Basic deck and the Interactive decks are very different. The interactive deck makes this a very different game as occupations can affect others as well as your own gameplay. Agricola is a fasciniating game with a lot of options (more than you can possibly pick from) and a variety of strategies that you can use to win, like all the best Eurogames. 

The game gets spoiled in my opinion if the decks get mixed together.

4 games were the family game, the rest have been the full game with the cards. I like how the cards allow you to do more with your time. I enjoy it, but my wife would give it a 6ish, she says she wishes there was more time to build her farm and gets mad when I play competitively;  This game has been bumped up to a 9 for now.

Brilliant worker placement game with astounding replay value. I quietly snub anyone who loudly snubs the stressful nature of the feeding and farm-building demands.

It takes several plays to get the hang of how to time your opening moves, how to leave back-up plans for yourself, how to jump-start your food reserves, and how to leap from engine to engine. 

I read about a lot of gamers who try it once, find it too hard, and they run off to Caverna. I'm glad Agricola doesn't just hand itself to you right away. It's a game you can get better at and you WILL get better at it with each passing game.

Arg. Arg. Arg.

So, I've only played this a handful of times, and almost every time, it's been as part of a group that includes people who've played it dozens and dozens and dozens of times.

I really like the family version, possibly because I did really well at it the first time, almost by accident. It can be frustrating, never managing to get quite what you need in each turn, and finding that every action takes one extra action because you just can't get that 1 stone/1 wood/1 animal extra you need to be efficient, while others do. On the other hand, when you do manage to get what you want, success seems to build on success, and the game zips along. The flavour boards and animal meeples I picked up from the Goodies deck go really well with that, and it's fun, if sometimes frustrating.

Throw in the decks with the professions and lots of cards that interact in different ways I don't really understand, and which you have to build an engine out of that I can't work out how to put together, and it just becomes ninety minutes of losing painfully.

The rating may go up. For a native AT gamer such as myself it's clear that enjoying most of what this game has to offer entails a certain discipline of learning the game's rhythms and pathways. It's very cool to see such a robust engine in the game and one that makes good sense with the theme, too. I've only played one two player game, though, with the other sessions being solo. I'm glad I own this modern classic and look forward to exploring it more in the future (the iPad app will help, no doubt).

Update: The iPad has helped me get a grip on this game. Very tight, very oppressive and tense - but in a good, thematic way. I've not heard it compared with Ghost Stories but the feeling is similar, though with an aim towards desperate construction rather than defense. The rating is up to an eight. The only reason so far that it is not higher is because I personally prefer a little bit more slack to try out new strategies; if have a wasted action or two in this game you're toast. I look forward to more sessions, though, and finding new combos; the design is amazing.

RATING: 7
What I Like:
The theme, crazy enough. The Homesteading idea of living off the land is an extremely appealing thought to me. I think it comes through nicely with the professions and minor improvements. I like the variability of the cards, forcing a new strategy each play. And the scalability between 2-4 players makes it fill a game night hole nicely with a managable playtime of around 2 hours.

What I Don't Like:
The end result seems samey. Though the path to victory may be varied, the game doesn not allow for much deviation from the "optimal farm" design. I wish there was more of an opportunity to see a variety of winning farm designs. I undertand the fun comes from the earning and rewards forward planning, but I don't feel like the games tells much of a stary once you look at your completed mat. All the varience between players seems to disappear in the final 2-3 moves. 

Why I Still Own It:
It's currently the only worker placement game I own. It playes like more of a puzzle than a game, and I enjoy that. Coupled with the theme, I forsee this one sticking around for a while.

I found the starting cards added far too much randomness, predetermining the victor in many of our games. Also, the starting hands elongate the first turn as each player goes through their fourteen options to determine their whole game strategy, making the experience uneven.

Maybe if the cards were distributed slowly throughout the game, the play would feel better paced.

If the game were shorter, the randomness of these cards would be more tolerable.

The art, concept, basic mechanic and card variety are all good, but I cannot see Agricola becoming a longstanding default game for a group.

RATING: 6
Well designed game that feels a bit overwhelming the first time you play it. It's a lot cleaner than it seems at first sight, however. The reason I don't rate it higher for such a quality title, is the frustrating notion you're always falling short. Sure, there are many games that challenge you with tough choices and scarce resources, and I like that, but in Agricola it's haunting. I guess that captures the theme of farming back in the day, but that doesn't mean I like to feel it in a game.

It's typical of Uwe Rosenberg games, but the art style doesn't do it for me. Should be a minor quibble, but I like a game better when I appreciate its looks. I'm shallow.

LIked the game better with the expansion cards. That said, it's a pity that the extra cards make it somewhat more luck driven.

A classic game with a worker placement mechanic. 

Don't judge the game by its theme. Farming is not that exciting, but it works just fine here.

Envolving, challenging and kind of... "cute". It can be tough for inexperienced players, 'cause when we take a spot, it means you can't take it, so it feels like a race for the best spots to get the right resources to build the right buildings, to get the right actions.

Note that you'll feel that you wanted to do so much more at the end of the game, but that is how it works. You'll never do everything.

A very clever game!

This was my first Euro. Cute theme and a solid game, but unlike some others of its ilk, it just *feels* like it drags on forever, and even more so if it becomes clear  you're being left in the dust. Has as many plays as it does because my wife, sister and mom love it ("points, who cares? I have sheep and fences, whee!"). About 1/3rd of the plays have been with three or four players and the rest with two - I liked it more with 3+

I didn't think a game with a farming theme would be fun, but I was pleasantly surprised with Agricola.  So many different ways to go in the game, and you have to be prepared to change strategies or take advantage of situations that come up.  It will certainly be hitting the table again!  Now to decide if I buy this or Le Havre, or both...

This is a solid game, I'm quite happy with it.  I need to spend some time working on my strategy, but I'm sure I'll have many, many games to do that with!

I've been playing this more, and now I'm starting to see the beauty of the game.  Tons of decisions.  So many, in fact, that I can usually see multiple paths I could follow in the course of a single game.  Naturally you want to follow the most powerful course plotted by your occupations and minor improvements, but trying to stick too closely to that path when other players are blocking you can cost you the game.  My ex-wife often commented that this game (while fun) is more like real life than any other game: so many things you want to do, so little time and actions that you'll never get to do it all.  Just like life you learn to manage the game better and better with practice and get some of those things done in the end!

100 plays and I still rate this as a 10!  Most of these plays were two players, and including the Farmers of the Moor expansion.  Do I have enough in me to get to 200 plays?  Just maybe....

It's tense and rewards clear planning and analyzing. You get some help, because your starting hand points you in a certain direction, but after that you're quite free in what you do. The best moves usually depend on what the other players do, so there's some great excitement to be had there.

RATING: 5.5
I finally figured out what sucks the fun out of this game for me.  It's the decisions!  Sure, at a glance this game seems to have a lot of tough decisions, but after a while, I came to realize that no matter which path I chose, I always ended up at the same endpoint.

In reality, a botched worker placement usually doesn't matter much.  Most of the time, the next best move was worth almost as many points in the long run, so it's just a matter of how you want it to look.  I could take a veggie for a point, a cow for a point, or a few sheep for a point, or maybe just another development for a point.  Sure, it looks different, but they're all really the same when you truly boil it down.

And that's what frustrates me.  My decisions seem meaningless.  I really blame the scoring system for this.  Since you can't be tops on everything, you have to make sacrifices.  But everytime you do, you typically bump up a different track. So it's zero sum, you still end up the same.  I want a method for this game to let you go completely linear in your strategy, instead of always forcing you to half-ass everything.

These is something to be said for the "challenge" of feeding your family while still striving towards your goal.  However, I don't think it's tough enough to be judged on that basis.  If I want that sort of experience, I'll play Antiquity and have a game that truly hates me as a player.

I really liked the game, but my wife didn't like it and that hurt my enjoyment.  At first she thought it was too much of a brain burn, and then when she improved, she thought it was too boring.  I don't know if it would be better with 4 or 5, but it is certainly not fun enough 2-player when the other person doesn't want to play. Pain to set up and put away also.  Sold the game online, and immediately afterwards my wife wanted to play again. ARGH!

I can tell this is a good game. It's just a good game I do not like. There's so much micromanagement and resource management. I never really felt like I was going anywhere so much as slowly making my way towards the end with a few points. It's a game you would surely get better at after multiple plays, but like a similar game, La Havre, I just did not get into it enough to care.

Still a very good game, as a recent return to the game has reminded me, but not as good a Caverna which now occupies my #1 spot for worker placement games.

Maybe a hiatus in the playing of this game has re-vitalized it for me but on returning to it recently I've concluded that this could well be the definitive worker placement game complete with a fully integrated theme that has survived despite any number of expansions. The release of a very well done IOS version has also helped to renew my enthusiasm. Bound to be an enduring classic
******
Yet more play and I've notched the rating back down again. I must admit I was surprised at how fast this game rocketed to dominate the Geek Meter and even more surprised at its staying power (for now), but there was a lot going for the game in my first outings. The endless card combos salvage the game from circling into boredom (which the "family version" would have arrived at much sooner), but despite that our games are beginning to feel a bit like getting on a treadmill. Similar to "Le Havre" in that respect but with a livelier theme.
******
After more play I've notched up the rating on this game. It has become one of my favourites. There is more to this game than meets the eye and achieving a good score bestows a sense of accomplishment usually reserved for "heavier" titles. The different deck combinations make for extensive replayability.
******
Initial impression after first play is quite positive. The array of decisions and options is very broad indeed, but "Puerto Rico" looked quite intimidating at first also. I can appreciate some of the concerns with the end-game AP as there are so many different scoring considerations to sort through. Need to play some more which I don't mind...

Wide and deep game that I've probably only scratched the surface of.  With the right group I could easily become obsessive with this as it has that damnable "if only I'd done that" quality which comes from having more actions to complete than there is time to complete them.  The drawbacks to the game, such as they are, is that it is fiddly to set up, annoying to repopulate every turn and it can easily swamp some new players with all the detail.

RATING: 7
Feels similar to Race for the Galaxy on the interaction side - seems only interaction is picking an an action before others, but really it's all about working out your opponents strategy and predicting what they'll be doing next. However unlike Race for the galaxy it's hard to do that because of all the cards - each one is unique and does something and it's too hard to keep track of what everyone has and what they all do, so in the end you don't bother and it becomes a puzzle game. All in all not the '10' perfect game I was hoping given all the hype. Sitting 5th in a 5 player isn't much fun either, especially if you have lame improvements or ones needing lots of occupations to play, as you in effect burn an action getting the start player back, to watch it get changed again next turn with someone doing it mainly to play an improvement ...

**Update, now have my copy, and with repeated plays a number of my concerns become less. Still not sure about 5 player though. Definitely a learning curve, with newbies I'd only stick to the E deck, and I still have reservations about the power of the cards.In some ways it's like a CCG, with some good cards and some average and some that need others to work at all. Not sure that's a good thing for a game of this length. I think I like this best with some sort of draft mechanism to limit the variation in power of the cards. 

** 2nd update - definitely flavour of the month with most of my gaming friends - and my concerns about tracking others' cards diminishes as you learn the game and the decks. Once you're progressing on the learning curve this game is great - but I still prefer to draft the cards to help balance out differences in power, rating has increased from 6, to 7 and now up to 9.

** 3rd Update - played quite a bit and rating has dropped to an 8. Might dip lower depends how much more I play it.

** 4th Update - cult of the new has taken most people on to other things, so this isn't getting as much play. I quite like it - but have no burning desire to play, rating dropped to a 7.

** 5th Update - now have the expansion, and that has helped. Base game is a 7 for me, but with the Farmers on the Moor expansion it's either an 8 or a 9 :)

Overhyped development game with the place and activate mechanism. There a lot of better games out with the same base machanic but much better theme and game feeling (e.g. Caylus, Pillars, AoE 3 etc).

I revisited this game recently and something with it just clicked for my wife and I.  At first we hated it, but we purchased it when we were both really new at hobby gaming.  It sat on the shelf for nearly three years before I decided to randomly dust it off one night.  We played two games in a row and look forward to playing more.  I think it helped that I eased her in with the "family" version in the first game before moving onto the game with the cards.  Our first play three years ago I tried to jump right into the full game and it was probably too much at the time.  Either way, this one went from "for trade" to a keeper.  I'm glad I gave it a second chance.

This is a good design and I can see why people like this.  However, even without the person cards, this game drags for me. This is not so much a comment on the game play itself (which can also be quite slow depending on who you play with). The development of your farm is so slow.  These have to be the most inefficient farmers of all time.  The "children" in the game are full-fledged workers in one round, but it takes forever and a day to plow and sow or build a fireplace?  My highest ranked game that I really don't care if I play again.

I liked it on my first play.  For me, it's a lighter game than games like Power Grid or Steam, but it provides about as much depth in play.  The cards allow for incredible variety each game.  It ends at just the right time too, meaning it ends with you BEGGING for at least five more turns.

I put off trying this one for so long because I thought it was too heavy and the theme too dry.  I was wrong.

Played at BGG.Con.  This game has a lot of potential replay value because of all the cards and how they change your situation in the game.  I had fun figuring out how to make a go of it with just the tools on hand.  At the end of the game there's a sense of accomplishment when you've created a successfull farm.

I am concerned however that Agricola may not have enough player interaction to aviod the multiplayer-solitare pitfall.  More playing are needed to see if Agricola lives up to the hype.

I'm dropping the rating to a 6.  Once the newness of the game wore off I began to see Agricola for what it is.  A mediocre worker placement game that has a real lack of player interaction, soul and fun.  Sure the cards add a nice element of the unknown, but once you seen them all the game become nothing more than a near-solitare logistics puzzle.  Even the vaunted "I" or interactive deck dosen't change that assessment as most of the iteraction is very indirect or parasitic in nature.  In fact I call it the "P" deck.

10x10 2014. Tense and tight game.  Feels like it ends a little quickly and you can never do everything you want and it feels a little punishing as you struggle in the beginning.  This is something I usually don't like in games but after a bunch of plays I can appreciate it in this game.  Great combination of planning ahead and having to adapt when your first choice is blocked.  The cards and combinations of cards are the best thing about the game and they add a ton of replay value.  This was grower for me- it took 4 or 5 plays for me to really like it.

RATING: 8
Neat game. Like the mechanics. Family version and normal version are both fun to play. Family version has less luck to it, but also less variety. It reminds me quite a bit of Caylus, but this game is easier to explain and yet somewhat richer in possibilities. The farming aspect really seems to do it with a lot of women. I think because they can relate to it. Works well for 2 and 4 players (haven't tried 1,3 or 5 yet). I have played the game about 10 times now.Family version 6 or 7 times and normal only with 2 players.

Okay, I have explained this game to about 10 people now and most people seem to enjoy it quite a bit, but I have had some complaints that there are too many actions with too little workers. The replayability is tremendous. So far I have only used the E-deck and I am not even close to trying the I, K and Z deck. This is a top game and I am curious to see how Le Havre will do.

Lovely game of family support. Starvation is such a nice mechanism.

Haven't enjoyed the solo play. It feels very dry and too analytical when you can plan ahead so far. The random rounds doesn't necessarily seem to have enough affect. Planting seeds seems like it will be a desired path to take early because you'll want to wait for wood and other resources to grow.

Had to update to a 10. We play this to the exclusion of anything else right now, with no end in sight. We rode the RFTG train for 2 years, but I see Agricola outpacing even that. No expansions or anything are needed, we still see new occs and minors hit the table every game.
Balanced almost to a fault, we enjoy the 4- and 5-players much more than 2, 3 somewhere in between. A delight and masterclass.

Well, after my first play of this legendary game I'm giving it an 8. After further plays I can see it going up to 9. Will it get a 10 from me? I don't think so...

My problem with this game is that there are too many difficult decisions. Don't get me wrong... I love Puerto Rico and Caylus... two heavy games with a lot of tough decisions. But with those two, I feel that with a reasonable amount of time and a reasonable amount of effort, I can hit upon my optimal move and confidently make my decision. But with Agricola... not a chance. I've never been one prone to AP issues... but this game left me struggling to make a decision. It seemd like every move I made left me full of regret.

It's a strange criticism for a game, I know.

***

After a few more games, I'm sticking Agricola with an 9. THe downtime can be tough, especially with 5 players, which for me disqualifies it from a coveted "10" rating. Another point against it is that it isn't a very visually-appealing game; our tabletop during games of Agricola are a complete mess.

It's still a good game... not just the PUerto Rico-killer some are making it out to be.

***

After some more playing and much contemplation on the matter, I've decided to raise Agricola to a 10. Once you become more familiar with it the game speeds up and the decisions become a little bit easier. But what really convinces me is the game's cards, which encourage different approaches to victory.

UPDATE (Jan. 2010): I'm lowering this to an 8.5 because I now prefer Le Havre over Agericola. There's a a good g ame in there, but I find the fiddlieness and messiness of the gaming exsperience to be distracting.

First play was disappointing.  4er, family version, so clearly I'm not experiencing the whole game.  But I got the gist of it, and it just wasn't very fun.  It was challenging, and made me think, and had a lot of strategy and meaningful decisions.  But it wasn't very fun.  I'm still trying to figure out why.  I feel like I should have liked it, but my response is just Meh.  I have put this one on hold for the wishlist for now, and will borrow a friend's copy to play a few more times.

A worker placement game where there's never enough of what you need to do what you want.

Two player family game was fun, and competition got fierce for key spaces (such as wood and reeds). Though I anticipate suggesting this be brought to the table in the foreseeable future, it is more fiddly than Puerto Rico, and that detracts a bit from the play.

Played 4 player and there's a vast difference in resource allocation and distribution with that number. I still think this is very fiddly with all the wooden bits moving around.  Competition was again fierce, only this time over different key spaces.

5x 2 [0-5] [80']

(5 plays) Initial Rating: 6 After five 2 player games and one solitaire I think that this is a decent game, but nothing more than that.

It has got nice components, the theme fits very well and it plays reasonably fast. It doesn't have much interaction (no direct one, some indirect interaction) and in fact it is a multiplayer solitaire.

It doesn't live up to the hype though and in my oppinion it doesn't earn its No. 1 spot in the game ranking here on BGG.

Updated after 5 games: 
the more I play it the more I hate it. 

The mechanics work but they are no fun at all.The game involves a preposterous amount of bookkeeping (e.g filling the board with new resources at the beginning of a turn), the harvest phases are really clumsy, the symbols on the cards (cost, points etc.) are hard to distinguish, ... I am still willing to try it with more than 2 players, but if 3 or 4 player games don't convince me, this one goes to the trading pile! Lowered rating to 5.

I absolutely love Agricola. Though some consider the theme to be rather bland, there is something about building something out of nothing that is rather appealing. The game is usually pretty tense in the last few turns as everyone is competing to complete their planned out strategy, which really gives the game momentum in the end. This usually leaves everyone wishing there was one more turn. I've heard both "If I only would've had ONE more action!" and "We need to play this again... like right now" numerous times when playing this game. It's always left me anticipating the next game rather than wishing it was a turn longer so I could make the perfect farm. One of my favorites for sure.

Would like to get Z-Man edition to match up with expansions and stuff.


Warning:  not only is this game addictive, it will show up in your dreams!  Rating based on about a dozen plays (1-5 player), all with E deck.  Must paste up I and K decks!  UPDATE:  After a couple of plays with a mixed E and I deck, rating goes up to a 9.5, because I really would rather be playing Agricola at pretty much any given minute of the day.  I'm holding off upping this to a 10 until the initial infatuation has worn off -- we'll see where things stand in February or so.  UPDATE:  Okay, after 40  plays over three months, it's a 10.  Even as I type this I'm having a hard time resisting the urge to invite some gamers over for a game or three!

At its heart, this is a civ-building game.  There is luck in the initial hand composition, but I'm not convinced that it plays a conclusive role.  I've seen a player come in a very close second despite playing no occupations and only 1 or 2 minor improvements.  Instead, he focused on starting his fields and pastures and scooping major improvements while the rest of us were bickering over occupation and start player spaces.

This game is a "must have"! Unfortunately there is a small problem to find more players for Agricola. One of my friends hates it, cause it`s so complicated and demanding game. However - if You`re winner You know that You won, cause You`re smarter than the others;) I`m playing many (much different) games and winning in Agricola tastes the best. The interaction is very strong, however it`s not so obvious (it`s euro-game) - and player doesn`t have time for being a troll;)

[b]Sheepies:[/b] What phrase could adequately sum up Agricola? I love this game, in all of its fiddly, stressful, and multiplayer-solitaire awesomeness. In fact, I think the last quality actually makes it really excellent for groups in which some people might get offended by too much "interaction." The only thing that could make this game better for me would be more of a spatial component - which has made me really curious about Farmers of the Moor, or the [filepage=46343]"rocky ground" variant [/filepage] by GameRulesforOne.

I enjoy Agricola. The farming theme is very well done, and I get a kick out of growing grain and raising pigs to feed my family. I think the designers did a brilliant job of turning a humble subject into a rich game. It's surprisingly tense--feeding your family quite difficult, and the game punishes you harshly if you can't come up with enough food at harvest time. You're constantly battling against the feeling that you're running out of time and not getting enough done. This is both a good and a bad thing.

While I think Agricola is undeniably a good game, I have enough quibbles that it falls a bit short of excellence, in my eyes. First, it is not very interactive. You are competing with the other players for the same resources, so there's some interaction there, but there's pretty much nothing you can do to affect anything that's on your opponent's board. So the game can feel a little static. It can also get boring as you wait between turns for your opponents to make their decisions. Two-player Agricola plays pretty fast, but with three or four players expect to do a lot of waiting around.

My second complaint is that actually farming tends to be a losing strategy, which is totally nuts for a game called "farmer." I would love to start plowing fields and planting crops in the early game--but that is so action-intensive and inefficient that it is a sure loser (unless you have the right special improvement or occupation support.) Ranching is typically a vastly superior way of feeding your family. You'll do a bit of farming towards the end of the game to grab some points, but that's usually about it. Why does a farming game make farming so unattractive? The balance just doesn't feel right.

Finally, I don't love Agricola's scoring system. Players receive a fixed amount of points for having certain quantities of most of the products in the game: pigs, sheep, cows, etc. The problem is that the game harshly punishes the player for not having at least 1 of everything. This forces everyone to diversify in pretty much the same way, and means that everyone's farm looks similar at game's end. Furthermore, the actually point totals are arbitrary. You get -1/1/2/3/4 points for 0/1/3/5/7+ Wild Boar... and -1/1/2/3/4 points for 0/1/2/4/6+ Cattle. It's clunky and unintuitive. I also don't like that amassing huge quantities of one animal is not rewarded. It's a big accomplishment to get 15 wild boar, so why does the game not reward that at all? I think Caverna is a vast improvement on Agricola in this respect.

Amazing Game.  If you like games where you build an engine and see how the engine works over time, this is a must have.  Also, you can't play the same game twice due to the randomness of the "round cards" as well as the randomness in the improvements.

Has lived up to the hype for me- tons of interesting choices, decent player interaction, no luck, great strategy. Always look forward to playing this game.

Edit: Taking to a 9.5. The only thing that takes a slight edge off the game, is that after dozens of plays, I realize the cards can have a somewhat significant impact. This introduces an unwelcome luck element, however this is mitigated through card drafting or take 10 keep 7, etc. Still a very minor complaint for one of the best games of all time.

The game has an impressive number of cards in the several decks that come with it. This seems to be the essence of its appeal, lending a great deal of variety. However, some cards are better than others. Even with this imbalance issue, they don't dominate play. The decisions made in taking the finite number of actions is very crucial, and to me makes this game shine as a superb development game with every action counting. The key is combining the right cards into one's playing field with proper action selection both before and after these cards are played down. The actions are few (2-3 per turn), which keep the game going. UPDATE: Bumped down to a 9 as it has not been requested near as much lately. Perhaps the demanding attention required for the regular game play (not family game) has reduced requests. UPDATE: Liked the card drafting variant at the beginning to avoid some bland card hands. Upgraded again to a 10.

1-5 | (3-4) | 120 min | 12+ | Uwe Rosenberg 
Mixed feelings about Agricola. My rating varies between a 6 and an 8 depending on the day. What annoys me is that every game feels the same due to the final scoring conditions. You can finish your farm in many different ways, but you are basically trying to build the same farm, with a bit of everything. I like Le Havre much better because you can specialize.
--------------------------------
Update 1: Yesterday I played my first 5 player game. It was a wonderful experience, way better than 2 player games.
--------------------------------
(June 2010) All right, I bow to the evidence: this is a 9 if you draft the cards at the beginning of the game. After some more plays, Agricola tops Le Havre, though admittedly not by much. The fact that goals are shared in Agricola means there is more competition and interaction.
--------------------------------
(April 2017) Final verdict: still the best worker placement game out there and my favorite Uwe design by a mile. All-time Top 10 in my collection.

Where it shines and frustrates (at the same time) is the myriad of occupation and minor improvement cards. We randomly dealt the 7 cards from both decks and some players had lousy hands while some had awesome combos; thus unbalancing the game. We will try the draft mechanism next time.

The actions were very tight, constantly making you feel like you don't have enough actions and time to do all the things you want to do. Slightly reminiscent of In the Year of the Dragon's tension of disaster aversion, since you are constantly fighting to get food and acquiring every category to avoid negative VPs.

Look forward to future games. It may go up after more plays.

Update: Played a second game. This time a 3 player game. VERY tight actions. Definitely need a good food engine. We played with the card drafting variant. It very much balances out the hands.

Update: 
Rating 8.5 -> 9.0
Played a 5-player game with the Interactive Deck and card drafting. It was very intense! Everyone became very involved. The card drafting took 50 minutes but it was worth it because it balanced out the game. Some players had many awesome cards while others had really lousy hands. The card drafting fixed all that. The interactive deck made it less multi-player solitaire. Agricola is a winner. Much more 'fun' than Puerto Rico.

Update:
Rating 9.0 -> 9.5
It scales well to 3 to 5 players. Got the drafting down to 10 - 20 minutes (depending whether there are AP players present). Lots and lots of tension. So much to do in so little time. It's a game worthy of the anticipation and hype. We can all celebrate it being the new #1!!! (though it's not a top 5 for me, it is more worthy of #1 than P.R.)

I own the animeeples, vegemeeples, resourceeples, Z-deck, X-deck, Ö deck, signed L deck, Through the Seasons, 5 new player boards, new player colours. Yes, mine is all pimped up.

WARNING: Through the Seasons breaks the game. The expansion rates a "2". AVOID!!!!

Update Aug 2013 dropped to 8.5. Worker placement is wearing thin, though the 'gric stands its ground against other WPs.

RATING: 6
Rating after one play of family game. There's depth and lots of options packed in a smooth and well balanced game. Theme works well and game plays relatively quickly if there's players without AP around the table. Still maybe a bit too much optimization and too little player interaction. We'll see after a couple of more plays.

Edit: Played the game with the easier deck of cards. I feel that Agricola is not my kind of game. There's just too little direct interaction and too much optimization for me. I get bored with games like this. I still hope I'll be able to change my view after more plays.

The emperor has No Clothes!
 Despite all the hype, Agricola does not have elegantly simple mechanics for its abstract parts and almost enough details to be a simulation (not its aim)
Great graphics, components (animeeples are neat) and ideas but too many special conditions and fine print. Other problems: too many rule-breakers; need apriori knowledge of card order; clay should be red and stone – white (maybe straw, twigs, bricks a la 3 pigs?); hand size too big and varied. In need of a major editing; maybe I will try the no-card family version. Can see how it could be addicting as you learn a little more each time and want a “replay” (like a video game) to try and “beat the system” (which is randomized by the huge number of cards.)

I played this originally at one of the Unity Games, and fell in love with it. I'm always up for a game of it. But I dislike that feeling of always having too much to do and not enough time to do it. In that aspect, I think I prefer Le Havre, where the choices are a bit more limited - you're crunched, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. Strangely, I own this and not Le Havre. Go figure.

RATING: 10
Enjoyed the basic game.  Good fun.  An optimisation game, something I don't usually like.  I imagine I will enjoy this one on repeat plays.  My only concern is that this game could last a little long for what it is.  And there is no way on Earth I would ever select this as a gateway game - some have claimed it can be, I just do not see it!

This is an excellent game to be sure, but certainly not friendly to people who have not played before, let alone to people who have not really played games before.  It is satisfying building up the farm, but the game can be cruel, the rules complex (a lot of little exceptions and modifications), and the play length too long for what I would consider foisting upon an unsuspecting gamer-to-be...

That aside, it is a very good game that I think I will enjoy playing a lot.  I don't think I will ever get obssessed with this game, but I will certainly enjoy it, and am glad to have pre-ordered it.

My copy has arrived - looks very nice!!  I am impressed with the feel and look of the game - posts that write about the heavy weight of the game are not exaggerating!

Update: The wife and I really enjoy building our own little farms.  The cards provide quite wild swings (ie: good cards can make a huge difference), but for all that, it is a great game that is relatively simple to play and enjoyable to experience.  Well worth a 9 Rating in my book, and well worth the price and shelf space.  Top game.

Update:  My wife and I have played this over 25 times - for a game that requires this much set up Agricola is still a lot of fun and we love getting it out to play.  I've bumped the rating to 10.

After all these years, this is still one of the best games that I have ever played.

That's one of the things that I love about Agricola.

RATING: 5
Impossible to ignore the quality of design here, but not a game I enjoy playing - despite very much enjoying other eurogames. I just find the "indirect" player interaction in many worker placement games irritating rather than tense or enjoyable. 

I found it was just too easy for players to spoil other player's plans in this game, with little punishment for deviating from their own strategy. Furthermore, this spoiling can completely stop you dead in your tracks - meaning you can finish the game without even completing your plans. In some games this type of agony in defeat is the source of enjoyment in a game and what keeps you returning for more - or the risk of this type of defeat is the engine behind a tense battle of wits. However in both games of Agricola I have played, my plans being foiled felt more like I was tripped before the finish line as opposed to being out-run by my opponent in first place. 

I have rated the game a 7 because I think I can see some of the game's appeal, and do I think I would play it again if suggested. However, this isn't a game I enjoyed at all during my first two plays. Although there are parts of the game that intrigued me, I think my curiosity to play it again has much more to do with wanting to see what so many others see in this game - rather than for enjoyment's sake - but also because the game has me entirely confused as to whether I think it's "good" or "bad". One I will be surprised if I never play again, but not one that I will be actively looking to get to the table for a long time.

Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep.

Shut up about the sheep.

Fine.

Tell me about the game.

Whatever.  

No, seriously.

This game gets a 9 because it is well themed, reasonably well paced with little downtime, and the expansions are fantastic.  For once, a game that has a ton of variability and replayability due to the cards.  I wish other game makers (ex: Phoenecia) would learn from Agricola and add a ton more variation.  Sure, it's a lot more work in game balance, but it's well worth it.   Only complaint is that a few occupation/upgrades do seem to be considerably under or overpowered.  I suspect more tweaking should be done in this regard, and would be welcome in a 2nd edition (with even more expansion cards of course!)  The expansions ensure that the seeds for an entertaining game are sown.

2015:  upped to a 10.  Simply one of the few games that I'd be willing to play anytime.   I do like that we are now so familiar with this game that we can knock it out in about 40 minutes.

RATING: 8.7
This game is great, I won't blabber on about it and review it, instead I'll give some pointers and impressions after more than 10 games. 

It's very complex! When you are a beginner you want to imitate you opponents strategies to keep up, or worse you'll want to focus on only one thing the entire game, like creating lots of fields and plowing an sowing like mad. 

After a couple of games you learn that imitating an opponent is near impossible because of limited resources and you are better of trying to start one of the other possible strategies (1. building a room for future family, 2. upgrading house, 3. fields, 4. animals), it's usually not as simple as this because some strategies might be blocked by others.

You have to be very flexible and focused. Don't abuse one strategy and forget about the others. Don't waste actions on taking food, instead produce it while you do other actions (see major improvements). 

When you want a minor improvement it's a good idea to take the starting player as well (if you don't have it) but don't obsess about the starting player it's not worth wasting action on that one unless you have an improvement in mind.

This might help you win against your spouse/girlfriend, because I used to take a serious beating from mine before I started focusing on a flexible strategy.

This game is really fun, even with two players. I recommend using the cards as well, don't get stuck on the family version for too long.

Deep, multi-layered farm building sim. One of a small subset of Euros that greatly encourages deep, long-term strategizing.

When I read the rules, I thought it might be too fiddly, but I was pleasantly surprised by the game's pacing and fun factor. Everyone that I've played it with has been enthusiastic about trying it again.

Note: my group still enjoys this game after 20+ plays. However, I must caution that we always play the drafting variant (draw 7 occupations and minor improvements, pass 6 to your left, etc.). Without this modification, I think the inherent randomness of the card draws would have soured the experience for us. Feeling that you lost a game due to someone else's lucky (read: synergistic) draws isn't fun.

Llevo pocas partidas pero todavía me falta algo para ver la magia al juego (sobretodo por lo bien valorado que está en general). Es divertido, representa bien la fantasía de manejar una GRANJA pero me parece que está a un paso (quizás jugar más y ver como combinar los OFICIOS y las ADQUISICIONES ayude) de descubrir su valor. Sobretodo por esto tengo ganas de jugarlo más. 

Por cierto, me entretuve recortando unas pegatinas para hacer más amigable el juego porque los tokens de madera para las MATERIAS PRIMAS son un poco sosos. También preparé un inserto de cartón pluma para reorganizarlo todo.

The game is fun. But I find the opening strategies a bit limited. It seems to me that you want to grow your family as quick as possible, but if you don't get enough wood early on, this becomes very difficult to accomplish. The middle part of the game is the best, if you have your four or five member family, there are many options to grow your farm. The end game is mostly a scramble to diversify your farm to avoid negative point penalties.

The occupation and minor improvement cards are interesting, but you can be dealt a lot of duds if you do not get the right combination of cards. It can be frustrating to see your opponents lay down great combinations of cards while you are having trouble getting the resources you need.

It's not the next Puerto Rico, and saying it's the next Caylus will sell it short.  Agricola is something else altogether, and it's quite special. The fun factor is huge!  While the game is a lot of fun and the system is pretty cool, the game rises or falls based on the cards.  I'm in favor of variants that give you more choices of cards to pick from because if your cards suck your game is screwed.   The family game is tight and just as much fun - I highly recommend it for teaching the game.

RATING: 10
As you can likely tell from the sheer number of games of it I've played, Agricola is an old favorite. Sure, these days it seems a little less thrilling than it did back in the day (the day being the days right after we got it, when we could play 2 or 3 games of it in one sitting!), but mostly that's because so many other games have cribbed off of it, and worker placement is less hot than it once was. And I must admit, some of the shine has come off the game - at the same time, surviving 40+ plays without reaching sick and tired status is pretty good.

My main gripe with the game is that the scoring is a little humdrum. The game rewards balanced, large farms, and the chances for "specialty" scoring are pretty low, usually a few extra points based around an improvement. So the play tends to start fitting a pattern and it becomes easy, depending on the player count, to predict who will go for what when. Since it is hard to specialize, the game can feel samey after a while. The variety of cards help ward this off, but it's not quite enough. If you're getting into this now, rather than 3 years ago, I'd highly recommend getting the Farmers of the Moor expansion too - it adds a lot.

Note: Having played Caverna, I'd rank Agricola higher. Caverna is too close to Ora & Labora - lots of possible ways to go. (A lot of his recent designs seem to trend this way). There is more tension in Agricola as feeding is tougher.

A very good game. There are lots of choices to make, and with all the occupations and minor improvements you get a different experience every time you play. I also like that there are abundant opportunities to increase the challenge as you get more experienced. 

The game can be very punishing, though, especially if you get pushed out of a crucial spot, so it sometimes feels as if the game itself is an additional opponent for you to defeat. The drab cubes and discs included with the base game are awful, and almost make it unplayable IMHO. Getting the meeples is a must. 

My new preferred way of playing is the amazing iOS app, which might just replace the cardboard version for me once they include more decks. Hopefully they'll add Farmers of the Moor down the line.

I like the way the game develops, the aspect of competing for choices from the limited number of actions each turn, and the scoring system which rewards several different paths to victory.  The weakness in the game, which is also the attraction for many, is the randomness of the cards.  One player getting a lucky combination of cards that work well together will dominate over the rest who do not get that lucky.  I also think the cards that score bonus points at the end of the game for things that players will want to do anyway because those actions are worth points (like building a home out of stone) are unbalancing because some players may get them while others do not.  For the game to really work for me there needs to be a method for controlling that variability or balancing it out.  Something like having separate decks for bonus point cards, resource amplification cards, rule-breaking cards, etc. and then dealing an equal number of cards from each deck out.  Won't fix the problem of unbalanced individual cards, or of lucking into cards that work well with each other, but at least it would give everyone an equal spread among the different card types (e.g., everyone would get 1 or 2 bonus point cards).

RATING: 8
Resource building and worker placement with a huge variety from game to game.  Many ways to victory and many tough decisions throughout the game. Expands very well across number of players and even plays solitaire.  Two reasons why the game is not a 10 though. First, the game can get a little long with 4 or 5 players. Second - and most important - the variability of the occupations and minor improvements can give one player a big [dis]advantage.

RATING: 7
I am not sure what to think of this game yet.  It was a lot to digest late on a Friday after a long week.  Strange for a euro in that the mechanics did not possess the once-requisite smoothness in the way they interlocked.  Playing with a couple experienced players helped in getting through the game.  Player seating order seemed to matter a whole bunch.  Like I said, not sure what to think.  A "7" for now.

UPDATE - Thinking about the game the next day - is this the first Euro "experience" game?  Maybe.  Will play again - hopefully before too long.  Perhaps the Family Game this time?

UPDATE:  Have played this four times now, and I feel that each game is ALMOST fun.  I want to drop it and move on, but I find myself wondering now if I can turn ALMOST into a fun experience.  Will keep trying.

UPDATE:  I have come to like it, and respect it, but not love it.  Settles on an 7 rating, but I will likely play it more often than I will most other 7s.

It's a good game, a solid 7 in that given the time, I would usually be willing to play. But it's not the best thing since sliced bread, and I'm unlikely to request it. I like the mechanics, especially how things escalate over the course of the game. But resetting the supplies after every round interrupts the flow of things.

A list of overwpowered cards that should be removed depending on player count can easily be found. 

Tried a 10-choose-7 with a seasoned gamer playing Agricola for the 1st time in a long while and he managed to beat me. I can see how 10-choose-7 may make sense for first-timers but card draft definitely still seems the fairest for experienced/semi-experienced players.

Quite long, a little brain-burning, but my fiancee is strangely addicted (we learned/played it on Saturday, then she requested it Sunday morning!) so I've got to give this many thumbs up.

Also, those who say this is multi-player solitaire don't know what they're talking about. So you're building some fences? Maybe I'll take that small herd of cattle -- and EAT them. Ha ha!

RATING: 8.5
Strangely I wasn't that anxious to play this despite, or rather because of, the hype.  First impressions are of volume - of pieces - of options - and of rules.  Once you get into it the rules become a little clearer but, in a similar way to Caylus, extra options are added regularly - though here that is driven by the game rather than the players' actions and, unlike Caylus, most of them open up radical new possibilities rather than more of the same, albeit a slightly different variety.  The end result is lots of options to distract you if you're not careful and end game scoring which rewards those who aren't distracted.  On first sight it looks like scoring is balaced between all the aspects of the game but I suspect that isn't quite the case, though it will take some more games to work out the sweet spots.  Looking forward to playing again.  Further play has increased my score, with perhaps more increases to come - there's certainly a lot here to like.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. Lots of thinking and planning required.
Been playing with 3 players which is a good number. 5 players may slow down the game considerably.
Requires players to be at the same level of expertise.
UPDATE:
After having played several games I have found that the game is one of worker efficiency. You want to be able to complete as many actions as possible. Whenever you have the option to perform two actions you should do so, The seven occupation and minor improvement cards act as a focus for your game strategy and the right combination can give you the winning advantage.
Whilst some planning ahead for future rounds is worthwhile you don't want to do too much of one thing between any one harvest.
As a result the game is about balance as scoring penalizes you for specializing too much and ignoring facets of your farm (though some cards can work around this, of course!)

The daddy of worker placement games. Another game about reacting to what's infront of you and (like all worker placement) maximising your opportunity. The beauty of this game is that you will have 100* things you want to do and you'll have to pick 2 or 3! *OK - slight hyperbole!

Without the minor improvement and occupation cards the strategy to win is perhaps too similar each play, but these cards really add a flavour to the game, allowing you to try a different route to victory each time of play. And frankly there are enough cards even in the basic game to mean that you will never see exactly the same combos come around again.

I really like the fact that the board is different depending on the number of players which keeps it fresh, but most importantly perfectly balanced.

RATING: 7
OK, I think the 7 rating is about where this settles. It's a fun game, and I usually enjoy it, but I'm starting to weary of it as I find the cards to be frustrating as often as they are fun. Also, I think the pressure on wood in the early game is a bit too high, putting a heavy premium on cards that can bootstrap wood (or reeds). Not sure. But the balance doesn't seem right. Usually you know if you have a shot by the second harvest, and usually I know if I've won by that point; the early game is just really tight, and people who get ahead early will win. Also, as I mention, the huge variety implied by the vast number of cards seems deceptive; too many cards are too weak or specialized to be useful very often, and the I and K decks do not seem to stand alone well, so you need at least some E cards to make the game work, which seems to result in seeing the same core cards being played over and over again since they are the most versatile and useful.
---
UPDATE: Well, I've docked my rating a point. I still like Agricola, but I think the initial appearance of variety is deceptive. I think the card mix is too large, too inconsistent, and too surprisingly similar. It's not so much that there are strong cards, but that there are too many weak, useless, or too-highly-specialized cards, and that overall the cards are not helping the theme as much as I thought. I've found myself looking at my cards and seeing only a few legitimate plays and too few really interesting cards. I think the decks needed a round of culling to bring the card count down but the consistency up. It seems that not many games are going to be spoiled for everyone by one player getting great cards and dominating, but having your own game spoiled by a lousy draw occurs with somewhat disappointing frequency.

Also, the early game (Phase I & II) are dominated by getting a food engine going. This is almost entirely contingent on getting cards that enable you to do so in some way. Getting cards that accelerate getting that food engine going seems a huge advantage. Likewise, if you *don't* get that engine going by then, you're done and hardly need to play the rest of the game.
---
After playing some more, this may finally be a game the hypemeisters and I can agree on, more or less. First time through I enjoyed it but it didn't quite suck me in, but more play has improved my opinion. It's thematic enough, and balanced enough to be interesting (unlike similar games, there is almost always something productive to do, instead of having two or three good choices and "the rest"). I think the cards do a good job of allowing the game to have a pretty clean core system, with theme, depth and interest then introduced through the huge variety of cards.

It's still not perfect - the endgame scoring is a little awkward, and the rewards for doing things are not quite lined up with in-game activities, so you end up building worthless fences from time to time just to get a few VPs. There also can be a little lock-up at the end because almost every activity scores points for something, but it's not a smooth curve, there are peaks and plateaus, so towards the end you have to do a little more theme-breaking math than you'd ideally like. It's a little gamey, it would nice if it were better, but it's not a major problem, I think; it's close enough, and for the most part the game lets you play reasonably intuitively.

Definitely keep the player-count to 4 or fewer. 5 is too many, in my opinion - the game becomes too slow.

The coolest thing about this game to me is that your "scoreboard" isn't just a victory point track, but the actual engine you are building throughout the game. Impressively well balanced (not to say perfectly) across 2-5 players, particularly given how many cards there are.

I really like progression games like this one where you're slowly building up throughout the game.  There's certainly a lot to think about here, and making the best out of the cards you're dealt is a lot of fun!  While it's in your best interest to do a little of everything, figuring out what you can excel in based on the hand you're dealt really makes the game.  For me, Agricola hits a sweet spot where there are a lot of options without the game itself being too overbearing.  Plus, it has a very reasonable play time and it's just plain fun!

Update 11/6/10.

Before you read on, I need to make my bias perfectly clear: Agricola was the first "complex" Euro that I ever played.  It came immediately on the heels of Puerto Rico, and I found it so much richer, more challenging, and intuitive, that I immediately fell in love.  Consequently, however, Agricola also stands as a measuring stick--a Platonic form of Eurogame, against which others are measured.  Because of its central role in shaping my perspective, I strongly doubt that anything I have to say about the game can be considered "balanced" or "objective."


Agricola will always remain among my top-rated games, and, to me, it is characterized by two features that I think it does better than nearly any game.

First, it is archetypal of one style of Eurogame that I enjoy immensely: that in which players struggle within the confines of a highly restrictive game system, creating tension simply from the panic that players experience trying to keep their heads above water.  Agricola is the only game that has made me literally sweat at I'm performing my last action or two.  It's not that the decisions are all that hard, but optimal play requires careful sequencing that is easily thrown off by the choices of others.  Working flexibility and a backup plan into the game is the true source of challenge.  Particularly with three players (which is my preferred number of players for games), the tension toward the endgame is unbearably delicious  

Second, Agricola does the single-best job of any game in my collection integrating theme with gameplay (especially impressive when you consider just how many occupation and improvement cards there are).  If I plow a field in Agricola, my thought process is: well I ought to plant something to put this thing to use. And if I plant some grain, I can bake bread later, which will require an oven, so maybe I'll get some clay now while it's cheap. None of this is explicitly in terms of victory points, or action/opportunity costs (although those do help guide and shape more tactical decisions). At this stage, I'm just trying to build a cool farm in a game about farming.  And building a cool farm is a winning strategy, so there's no thematic disconnect.  The farming feels like farming; the snozberries taste like snozberries.   

If forced to list Agricola's weaknesses, I would point out that I find the game lacking with only two players.  The gameplay isn't dramatically different, but your opponent's choices are more obvious, and there are fewer game-altering events between each of your moves, so the need for flexibility (what I cited above as "the true source of challenge") is meaningfully reduced.  This weakness is drastically improved by the addition of Farmers of the Moor.  I would also point out that some people are bothered by the impact that the initial card draw has on the game, and also by the lack of variety -- you're building the same farm every time.  I am not bothered by these criticisms, but they exist and I would be remiss not to mention them. 

So, basically, I love the game.

I enjoy trying to hone my medieval economic farming machine in this game, and the card decks ensure that each game is a bit different from the last.

You can't do all you want to do, you don't feel like you are fighting other players, but more that there is not enough room for everyone. 
It feels like the best player is the least mediocre.

Also I think a bit that cards given at the beginning can be unbalanced.

Played the first game.  It's a hard game to get in to.  I don;t hate it like I hated Puerto Rico the first time, and Puerto Rico is turning into one of my favorite games.  I will pass judgment once I have played more games.   Heather doesn't love this like she loved PR from the first play though.  It does play OK with 2 players, so that is nice.  Felt like giving the game a 1 rating, but that felt petty.  Will upgrade once I feel better about the game.

Still feel like 6 is appropriate.  Want to play some more.  Need to add more of the complexity with Occupation and Minor Improvement cards.  Also, want some of the Action Cards that come along with have 3 or more players.  Might lengthen the game, but still seems fun and fast enough, especially when played with the right people.

Game didn;t lengthen too much with 3, but didn;t get mych better either.  Need to ramp it up to not just the Family game.  Until then I need to push it down to a 4.

I like this game. It was really hard to learn from the rulebook in this edition.

However, the tutorial in the iOS app ended up being the best way to learn the game.

The game is pretty heavy, though, especially with all the different decks of cards. We've only played the "family version" (without cards) and with the "easy" deck. Still, you can tell that there is a lot to this game, especially if you put the time in to learn all of the cards.

It looks like we might trade this game away, though, in favor of the "collector's edition" that is scheduled for sometime in 2018.

Wow, what a disappointment this was. I was looking forward to playing this classic, but found it only to be a random collection of tasks that used farming terminology (e.g. "sheep"). I never felt like I was implementing a farming process, just grabbing whatever chore was left. The cards have so much text on them they may as well not have any art on them at all. I'll give this one more try at some point but I don't have high hopes.

The greatest joy for me with Agricola is looking at my starting hand and trying to figure out how to leverage this hand into my dream farm. While keeping an eye on what the others are doing so that they don't interfere too much with my plans (timing my actions so that I block them rather than them blocking me).

I also like building a beautiful farm.

The game, unfortunately, is very complicated. Very complicated. I'd rather play the much simpler All Creatures Big and Small for the joys of building a beautiful farm with a variable set up.

Family game, 2 player. I'll revisit this rating if I can stomach trying it with the cards, but the core mechanism bores the shit out of me. The rules are poorly written, don't seem to stick and are totally athematic. A farming game could be fun, but where is the farming? All I see here is cube-and-disc shuffling for VP's. I think I'm done with cube-management snoozers; the cards will probably just add to the agony. It's well liked--good for them, bravo, more power and all that--but it's not for me.

[Note to self: why bother trying again with the cards when you were massively bored and borderline irritated for two family games? Trade it! Life's too short to spend time trying to figure out how on earth such a middling game managed its way to top the BGG ratings.]

I might rate this game higher if I played it fairly regularly. As it is, it has a hell of a steep learning curve and since I play so infrequently, I have to re-learn every time, and this dampens the experience a lot.

This is a longer game than I typically go for, but this is really an excellent system. The resource game is taut and exciting, and there's a massive amount of variety thanks to the fantastic occupation cards with very little in-game luck.

It is just... well, a bit fiddly. The rules have a slew of gotchas, and it's just very hard for me to process everything that's going on in this game. Specifically, the scoring system feels much more convoluted than it needs to be. Perhaps some of these things are just an issue of presentation, but either way, it's just plain difficult for me to get an idea of how well I'm doing sometimes.

It's also only fun if all players are roughly the same skill level. It's very easy to fall behind, and when a game is this long you really don't want to be the one in last.

Though the idea of farming is boring, the colorful board makes the theme feel quite charming (and relevant). I just wish that the base set included all the special animeeple/resourceeple bits that came later, instead of cubes. It seems small, but they improve the experience tenfold.

All in all, this is a design I hugely respect, but my personal tastes skew a bit cleaner and shorter.

The action board fills so quickly and there you are at the end of the 6th harvest wondering where the time went.  Easy to play, we'll see how easy it is to master.  Sheesh, I still have three other decks to open.

11/29/09 After 7 plays I can tell you that the theme is perfect.  Farming may not be for everyone, but the game has such an organic feel.  From the growing of grain and vegetables to making babies, it just feels right.  heh.  
btw- I play the family version more offten and it seems to be the better game.  The choices are still tough but there is less hang up from trying to get synergies from cards and luck from the drawing or drafting from the same cards.

VERY IMPORTANT: This game probably needs 8+ plays to really click.  This comment alone I think is important for those wanting to dive into this game.  IT NEEDS EXPLORED MORE THAN A FEW PLAYS TO GET IT.

It is a perfect game design!

I used to think I liked Caverna better, but after more plays I've truly come to appreciate the magnificent beauty of this game.  I still LOVE Caverna and wouldn't trade it for anything, but the cards used for Agricola give it the edge in variability.

This fun game tells a great story in an abstract way.  I feel like I'm part of an important, yet simple slice-of-life adventure.  You are participating in a short story in which you are the main character.  It places high demands on reading comprehension

The 300+ cards create an infinite number of replayable scenarios.  It takes 10-15 minutes at the beginning to set-up and read all the cards that you get.  You need to be in the right mood to enjoy this, it is a time commitment and requires a lot of mental energy.

There is a lot of down time with 5 players.  Expect 30 minutes per player.

I really like Agricola a lot because of the infinite options the game seems to give. All those different cards you can get, in all those different combinations. It takes awhile to get hold of the options you've got with the different 'Ausbildung' and 'Kleine Anschaffungs' cards. I have a strong feeling that my personal rating might go up with more plays.
I first need to work on my personal score because I currently stink at the game. (Solo game only 14 points - I had 3 bettelcards, 3player game only 13 points).
Note to myself: PROCREATE AS FAST AS YOU CAN !!! 

Second solo game: 28 points (notched my rating up to 8.5)
Third solo game: 34 points
Fourth solo game: 35 points
Fifth solo game: 45 points
Sixth solo game: 51 points

Believe the Hype, This game is completely awesome. It reminds me of so many games yet improved while at the same time unique. I have played twice once with 4 and the other time with 2 and both games played very well. I will need more plays to be sure, but I think this is definite top 10 for me. Only issue I can see is getting the wrong mix of cards in your hand could pose some problems.

After a few more plays this just has to go up to a 10. A Must Have on every level.

Agricola is the archetypal worker placement Euro and one of the best games not only of that genre, but of Eurogaming in general.  The basic mechanics of the game are incredibly simple - place workers and carry out actions; retrieve workers; harvest crops, feed workers, and breed animals, if required - but the freedom of choice that one has with regards to how to develop one's farm, grow crops, keep animals, build Improvements, and use Occupations is amazing.  Also, the variety of Improvements and Occupations provided and the different ways in which they interact make for infinite replayability.  Who thought a game about farming could be so much fun?  Truly, one of Uwe Rosenberg's masterpieces and a pinnacle of gaming!

The number of strategic options in this game are mind-boggling.  A beautifully produced game that is fun, because it feels like you are actually producing something.  This game does suffer from the worker placement problem that I have noticed in Caylus and Pillars of the Earth.  Due to its tactical nature, the indirect competition can be rather frustrating.  I also like Caylus more because it is not just a point grab as Agricola is, but rather a game where you manufacture points abstractly.  In Agricola, many turns boil down to weighing how many points each option immediately gets you.  Again, small criticisms of an otherwise amazing game.  It's number one for good reason.

RATING: 7
For me, Agricola lies on the very edge of complexity in terms of what I am able to enjoy. 

Where Ora et Labora and Glass Road took the concept of special power combos to an absurd, bewildering degree with dozens of interlocking buildings and goods, the fact that it is limited here to 14 individual cards that you can examine before the game, and then a manageable amount of major improvements is limiting enough that I feel I can drive through a coherent strategy. 

There is also just enough interaction in competition for spaces and buildings that I feel like I am playing a game against other players. And the theme is excellent and ties everything together nicely. 

That said, this is never going to be the style of game that I can love - individual player boards and everyone trying to maximize efficiencies somewhat independently. But my favorite of this type. 

And the fact that I have probably played 50 times and don't cringe when it comes out is probably enough to warrant a 7.

[u]October 09:[/u] After 4 2p games with 2 different people. We all lied the game. The theme about farming is quite to my surprise a reall big plus, it is actually fun to grow some vegetables and see your cheptel expand. I have one concern though, the scoring... I find it very very bad... I understand the need to diverse oneself, but I think this is too much, and too complicated... Laurène has the same feeling about this, Matthieu doesn't. Anyway, that doesn't stop me from giving it an 8...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
First of all, I think every review should contain positive as well as negative aspects of a game. So let's start with my problems with Agricola: ...

Good, now that I have mentioned all of the flaws in Agricola (just kidding; there are two issues, and I will get back to them later), let's continue with why Agricola is actually my favorite game of all time! There is so much to do each turn yet you can't do all of them which is quite frustrating but, to me, strangely satisfying as you really have to balance the value of the different spots on the board. Also, you can block opponents by taking an important spot, so it can be played with just the right, small amount of nastiness/aggressiveness which I like. The tension in the harvest phases is great; you're always worried about whether you've collected enough food and you're almost always barely paying the food limit. Get a begging card and you will have a hard time winning...

I like that there is no optimal move in the start of the game like there is in Puerto Rico where you "should" pick Settler and grab a quarry... However, in Agricola, there are a lot of good options throughout the game and no dominant strategy (not that there is one in PR either, not at all). Still, it's almost always a good idea to try and grow your family as soon as possible as more actions usually transfer to more victory points - just be sure that you are able to feed your offspring!

You might have a couple of occupations/minor improvements which suggest that you should perhaps plow a couple of fields and sow grain, or that you should grab some clay and build a fireplace etc., and even though the cards definitely do not push you in any direction and determine your strategy, they ensure that you can't use the same strategy every time - and that's a huge plus as each game will play out differently! There are different paths to victory but you always need to get a little bit of everything which I think is a cool feature compared to other games where it's good to focus on specific stuff. 

Here, you need to get a big family, upgrade your house, get all kind of different animals, build fences, plow fields etc. and it can be pretty hard to do so when you also need to get food... Which leads me to saying that I really like the two main strategies for getting food! It does seem that I'm personally better at being a rancher than a baker and I prefer this strategy, but again it kind of depends on the cards and what the other players do; again, it shows that Agricola does have interaction between the players and that you need to improvise in order to win! Sure, you can lay down a big strategy, but when the people block you off from the spots you want to go to, you need to adapt and make some tactical changes...

There is luck in the game and some cards are better than others, but I have never felt I have won or lost due to lucky draws (and my opponents haven't complained about that being the case either). 
Many of the cards are good if played correctly, and after all it's not like you're going to play 10 occupations/minor improvements during the game... I think the cards add a great variety; so far I've almost only played with the E-deck, but I'm going to play much more with the I, K, CZ, Ö etc. decks going forward - and I can't wait to try the crazy X and L decks, although those seem to be somewhat silly, so they are definitely not decks I'm going to play a lot, and after 50 games I still haven't used them...

Now, let's talk about the few issues I have with Agricola. Because, yes, I do have something negative to say even though I've rated it a perfect 10. First of all, there is the luck of the draw - I've played a couple of games where I basically just knew right when I was dealt the cards that I would lose... And that kind of sucks! Still, it hasn't happened too often, and if you're drafting it shouldn't be a problem, and if you play with 10-7 like I do it's also not too likely. Just be aware that sometimes you can be screwed by the cards...
The other thing I don't really like is the fact that family growth is a strong move - more actions in a worker placement game is almost always a good idea! This means that the first half of the game is a frantic pace of collecting resources in order to build a new room (well, it's not exactly this bad, but you get the gist). It's very hard (well, almost impossible) to win if you only have two actions each round while your opponent has four... But everybody knows this, so everybody usually gets their third action soon after the first player does. However, and this is what bothers me a little, you never know when the family growth action is going to show up - meaning that you have to hope that it turns up the round after you just took starting player, otherwise you almost have to take it again just to prevent the other players with empty rooms in doing so, and this can be a wasted action.

Despite these flaws, I love to play Agricola! It's my favorite game, followed by Terra Mystica with Hansa Teutonica and Castles of Burgundy in a combined third place.

Oh, finally I guess I have to compare it to Le Havre (which is a great game as well) like many do... However, to me, Le Havre honestly didn't remind me of Agricola at all except for the facts that ressources accumulate until somebody grabs them and that you need to have enough food at the end of a round - and that is where the (lovely) frustrations and your planning come into play! 

Overall Agricola is an extremely balanced game with no superior strategy and it works very well with 1-5 players - yes, I have even tried it solo - the only game IIRC that I've played solo, that's how much I like it, and it works well. I haven't played it much with the full 5 players, and I think I prefer it with 4. It only takes around 1-1½ with 3, at least for our group, so it's a game which will definitely be hitting the table a lot in the future!

So all in all: it's a brainburner, has huge replayability, scales incredibly well, the components are great, it's tense - the gameplay is just awesome!

I'm pretty sure that I won't grow tired of it and I always want to play it, so I have to give this wonderful game a perfect 10 - it's my favorite!

Can be hard to plan ahead when it's not your turn. Also some of the occupations (particularly in combination with others) seem overly powerful making the game unbalanced from the start. Has downtime issues with more than three. The end of game scoring system rewards those who have a very rounded farm and punishes players who have tried to specialise so we are all forced to build the same 'average' farm. Revgiblet's excellent and amusing geeklist (#51357) summarizes why I don't really enjoy this game.

I'm glad I never bought the expansions to this now that it's been supplanted.

WOW. Really took over our gaming group for an extended run. People even got into the solo play challenges. I find it completely engaging while playing and a little stressful in the good way.

As a design it is absolutely stunning. The work that must have gone into this is staggering. That so many paths can be taken and yet so many games are so close is such a joy as we near the end of each game. I knew I was truly enamored with the game when I heard that you had to heat your home in Farmers of the Moor and I got excited about it. Really? Excited about feeding your family and upgrading your house, and whether the pigs can breed? "Oh yeah! I can't wait to heat my house and clear the land?" Really? Really! 

UPDATE: 07/2011 Really prefer to play with Farmers of the Moor. Closer games, less of a formula to follow.

UPDATE: 05/2015 Not coming out due to extensive set-up and commitment involved with making it happen. Have to drop it a point because I'm reaching for easier quick games instead. 

11/2015 - Finally got it to the table with my mother, my nephew, and brother-in-law. This goes back up to a 10.  What is it about this game that's just so good? It was all their first game and still the session was filled with wild laughter and jokes and people eager to play it again. 2 hours and the time flew by.

Played once, with two newbies (including a five-year-old) and one experienced player.  I just focused on improving my position, without worrying about what everybody else was doing.  Somehow I managed to win!  Except that the real winner should have been the five-year-old, who forgot to get food one round, which cost him six points in beggars and the game.  (I won 32-31-29-21)  OK, the five-year-old is my son, and I did coach him some, but still, I am rather proud of him. :-)

Not so sure about this one. I like the basic development mechanics but am tired of games where the only interaction between players is choosing an action and thus delimiting their choices. 

I would have preferred some sort of auction mechanism such as El Grande uses where actions come out and are bid on with a fixed set of cards that are the same for each player. Or something so everyone has a chance. Even having action cards in 5 different piles or something based on complexity. 

Need to play a few more times.

I played Agricola a few times and was consistently underwhelmed by it.  For a game as popular as it is on BGG I just don't get it.

For starters, there's a massive stack of cards, but each player only ever gets 14 of them.  And the winner invariably seems to be whoever manages to randomly get dealt cards that happen to work well together.  Might as well just play Snakes and Ladders for all that strategy seems to matter in this game.

The game has some nice features.  The theme is consistent and well-implemented, and the idea of building up your farm as you go is good.  But gameplay itself is simply underwhelming.

I wouldn't recommend buying this game.  Play something like Puerto Rico instead.

The worker placement / resource gathering type of mechanism is to my liking.  This game definitely lives up to its reputation as a well done game.  Some may not like it due to its economic engine type of mechanics, but I think it works well.

This game defintely deserves the ratings it receives (even by those that give it a "1", since it isn't to everyone's liking).  But I like it, so it gets and deserves a high rating by me.  Uwe and everyone else did a great job with this game.  It certainly is a brain-burner, and there is a lot of thinking and planning - especially with the tightness of having only 2 family members for much of the game.  A great amount of fun, and worthy of its praise.

There is a *lot* going on in Agricola, in the good way.

It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the actual mechanics are simple and fun.

Agricola is heavier than many people assert, but in my opinion, it is worth the complexity.  I seem to be in the minority when I say I prefer Agricola to Caverna; I think Agricola's tighter decision space makes for more interesting play.  The Farmers of the Moor expansion is a great addition.

The iOS version is the best adaptation of a board game to iOS I've seen.  Frankly, my love of the iOS version has made it almost tedious for me to play the board game.

Definitely a game that improves with multiple plays, the real difficulty is the length of game. Your first session is a write-off while you learn the rules, the second is about trying out new strategies so it's not until the third session you actually feel like you're playing with any confidence. 

I'm hoping the iOS app might take some of the grind out of learning for one of our group, because I think she'll really like playing it but will get frustrated by the amount of time invested to get there.

RATING: 10
This will probably be a 10 for me.  You gain victory points for building up your farm the best.  The more children you have the more actions you can take in a game turn but the more food you will need to feed all the hungry family members.  Actions are selected like they are in caylus so this game will be compared to that one a lot, but I more see the game as likened to Princes of Florence.  You are dealt a starting hand of farm improvements and occupations and the way to win is to best utilize these cards to fit your engine, much like in PoF you have to make the most victory points out of how your cards fit together.  The crazy thing about this game is that there are so many cards that no two games should feel the same.  This may be its only drawback as well, as certain card combinations will most likely lead to certain victory - but time shall tell.

This is a great game.  I guess it's a euro, but as an avid trasher, I still enjoy it.  The available/variety of actions are just right for worker placement.  You can't do every action you want, but enough good actions are usually available that you're not wasting your turn.  I definitely prefer a restricted set of decks, with a card draft.

Who knew dirt farming could be so fun. I think it is true however. It is "HARD to put food on your family."

It has arrived.  Only played one demo game with uninterested girlfriend.

RATING: 8
"The" eurogame. Easy to learn, wonderful materials (even more if you pimp it with meeples they sell separately) virtually unrepeatable thanks to the hundreds of cards (which actually increase the degree of luck, otherwise quite absent). The lack of direct interactions between the players is anyway counterbalanced by the chance to subtract possibilies to the other players and by the trasparent situation of every player's production situation: which makes the game very competitive. If you have a group of light gamers, this is your choice.

RATING: 5
Out of obligation, I traded my copy of Ys for Agricola. After all it is (or was) the #1 rated game on the ‘geek. So, I felt like I owed it to myself to have a copy.

I’m not sure Agricola will ever be a top 10 game for me, but I do like my worker placement games, and Agricola does it well (and did it before the big explosion of these sorts of games). There’s plenty of tension in the choices for resources. Unfortunately, I still haven’t played this game with any regularity. I owe it to myself to get more 3-5 player games in. Agricola forces you to fight against a harsh game system, and I like games that provide that sort of tough alternatives, as it helps to focus my game decision making.

Some random observations -- The rulebook is really bad, but the game itself is fairly intuitive. Scoring is not immediately apparent, and it does force you to “homogenize” your strategy as the game goes on, ultimately shooting for many of the same things each game. It does not allow true specialization. Also, I understand why folks “pimp” their games. The standard cubes and discs are a bit bland given the diversity of resources. And lastly, I'm still surprised though that some consider this a family game, and I find the array of choices to be pretty difficult for a casual gamer. I doubt I'd get my Mom to play this.

Update: I ultimately traded away this well regarded game. It never clicked with me. Part of that might be that I was late to the party. Too many cards, too much frustration. If I want this again I can always trade for it. But I don't see my wife playing this game. So, off it went.

There is no betteer game than Agricola. The amount of strategy and mind power that goes in to playing this game is one of a kind. The solo version of this game is incredibly addictive and it never gets old. I find that playing solo versions of games help to teach you strategies while you play and you get an idea of how the various cards help you and the various actions help you. This can prepare you to be more agressive in a multi-player game. I find this game is also very balanced with a full number of people playing. You just have to start out with one particular strategy and stick with it. You can't change your strategy throughout the game. You have to be agressive, and if being agressive means you maintain control of the first player token to insure you get your resources or can take the actions you need to when you need to. The game is never the same because the occupations and minor improvements change every game. There is no guarantee on what you're dealt. :0)

After 6 plays

A good game, but not excellent.  The limited choices each turn lead to scripted play regardless of the variability of the cards.  I personally find that it's too long for what it is and that games like Caylus Magna Carta fill the same niche much more elegantly.

More comments at:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/235129

What has surprised me about this title is that in all respects it is the antithesis of Rosenburg's gem "Bohnanza". It is inelegant, weighs a ton, costs and arm and a leg, is filled with exceptions (from the cards), and has near zero player interaction.

I was surprised to find that Agricola lived up to the hype surrounding it on the geek.  I find myself thinking about the game when I am not playing, which puts it in a rare category of games.  I feel like the occupation and minor improvement cards add a lot of replayability.

RATING: 7.23
Main Positives: It's one of those games that got me hooked to the worker placement mechanic. The variety of ways to succeed in the game really hooked me in the game. Not very slow AP-wise.

Fun Factor: High to medium
Complexity: A bit high especially with the reading of cards at the beginning of the game.
Replayability: Play more of this game if you want to get better at it. For me, I like the variety of things you can do which can make it a different game each time.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
Can't put all your eggs on one basket (my weakness is that I do). This usually costs me the game. Also, reading a lot slows down the preparation for the game especially if you or someone is a first timer.

Solid heavy game. The longer it sits on my self unplayed the less I like it. It's stressful trying to feed your family and the game forces you to do it all instead of focusing. That said, it is still a solid puzzle and can be even more fun solo trying to beat your best score. The number of occupation and minor improvement cards is insane and makes it highly replay-able. I'd like to try Caverna and decide which one I should keep - or ditch them both for a Feast for Odin.

I have played well over 500 games of Agricola, and I find that the strategies are still deep and challenging and that even with my experience I still have games where I am barely keeping my head above water especially if the other players are playing cut-throat or have similar feeding engines to what I am trying to employ.

I cannot see another game knocking this one off for interesting player interaction and building in my book.  It packs an incredible amount of depth into 40 minutes-90 minutes.

This is a must have game.

A game I am always happy to play. Lots of strategy, different choices to victory. It scales up very nicely from 2 to 5 player. We started without the cards but they definately improve the game and make it different each time however they need to be treated with some caution as you can become fixated on getting out your cards and this can be a distraction. I wish I could get hold of the wooden animals and resources more easily as they add a better look when playing the game.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Part of that probably had to do with playing with people I like and hadn't played much with in recent months. Besides that, I found it to be a totally functional implementation of the worker placement/action selection mechanism in the context of efficiency engine. That is to say: pretty bland. Lots of little decisions. Zero drama. The push away from specialization in the scoring seems necessary to create the tension of the action selection. While reduces the 'paths to victory' that so many people beg for, it emphasizes the interaction - a plus from my perspective. It changes the game from an engine building game to a blocking/anticipating game. I imagine that my appreciation would grow over several games as engine-building moved to autonomous brain function and blocking became the focus of my thinking/planning. However, after that, I imagine my interest would quickly wane because, frankly, the blocking doesn't seem particularly interesting. Moreover, the single-path issue would eventually lead to indistinguishable plays. Zero drama, untineresting little blocking decisions. Not my thing.

Fantastic game. I do not know where I stand on the debate between Agricola and Caverna.

As it stands, the two games are about even.

RATING: 7
Having played with all the player numbers from two through five, the game does seem to scale well.  Throwing all the cards into the mix seems like it could create some very good, or very poor, combinations.  The games seem to flow from the cards you get, and analyzing and thinking about the initial hand of cards dealt is probably much of the strategic part of the game.

In the end, it's a solid game, but I'm finding my tastes slipping a little away from the passive-aggressive nature of worker placement eurogames.  But, this could turn out to be the best of the bunch, I'm not sure.  I do like that the cards vary the game tremendously between playings - but I could see others being turned off by the chaos of the whole affair.

Update: This has proven popular with the kids, so has seen many more plays.

RATING: 10
So far my favorite game ever.  There is so much strategy adapting and so many things to do, no game is like any other.  Yes the cards feel like they are driving the strategy, but as it's the only luck factor, I actually like it a lot.  It in fact adds to replayability of the game (which is quasi infinite).  I don't think I'll get bored and really hope my playgroup feels the same about it.

:sugar: :) :D :D :D :D On top of the plays recorded, I have played the hell out of the iOS version of the game (I don't record games vs. an AI because REASONS), and I am slightly upticking my love for this title again. Agricola is a game that fundamentally [i]works[/i]. It's a classic engine-building economic-snowball game playable by any number between 2 and 5 (though playing time compounds with each additional person at the table), and the game is subtly but significantly different at every player count. It is playable (and actually pretty good) in the form of the introductory "family" game but really takes to the air once you play the full game with the cards.

Like Dominion, the basic challenge lies in finding the best combination of goodies (in the form of occupations and improvements) to maximize the number of useful actions you can take. Like Struggle of Empires, you would ideally like to add a new ability every round but must balance that against the need to actually do the actions that give you victory points, so knowing when to push forward and when to hold back is critical.

Agricola is a game of significant complexity and subtlety (maybe a bit less complex than, say, Dominant Species, but only a bit) but the genius of the design is the way it uses the gentle pastoral theme to file the edges off the complexity and reduce the intimidation factor for newcomers. It's obviously not a [i]simulation[/i] of Mitteleuropan peasant life, but mechanics do reflect reality in nice ways -- it does a great job of impressing upon you why Not Eating The Seed Corn became the truism it is.

I am consistently taken aback by the number of people who quickly and intelligently grasp the mechanics of the game; people who would hit brainlock in five minutes when confronted with Caylus or Dominant Species just love building up their farms. Another nice feature is that your score is more or less a direct reflection of how well you played, so as skills are gained, you get gratifyingly rewarded with better scores.

The downsides? It's not short, it can definitely be more of an exercise in multi-player solitare than some folks want, and the luck of the initial deal will sometimes enrich you and sometimes leave you high and dry (try the "draw ten, keep seven" or "draft" variants to keep this from being too decisive), and unlike Le Havre (for example), the scoring is such that you find yourself straightjacketed into a generalist approach, which can cramp your style a bit. But, if I can be real about this for a minute, the winning conditions for a game are what they are, innit? Complaining that you lose points because you didn't grow vegetables is akin to complaining you lost Brass because you got the most money but the fewest VP.

These are nits, though. Agricola is a fantastic game, with tons of variety and replayability in a single box, appropriate for most ages and skill levels, that will more than pay for itself in the amount of fun you have. Not my favorite game, but without question the one game I would choose to appeal to the maximum number of people.

Although many seem to like it a lot, I find this game very repetitive: option cards pop up at more or less fixed moments, resources are very predictable and the components are very abstract, with fences being bigger than stables and houses being as big as a weed field, while each family member eats the entire produce of two vegetable harvests per year and newborns grow up in one year's time. The extensive use of boards for examples, resource storage and even card display makes the game components a bit confusing.

The cards that give small advantages give such small advantages that they add very little to the game at all.

The components are good quality and the game can be played solo as well as with quite a few players, which saves it from being a total waste of cupboard space.

RATING: 8
This is a very solid game. There are so many things to do and very little time to do, well, ANYTHING. I really like the feeling of building up my "engine" but just as it gets running the game is over. It plays fast as long as you have a plan, AP can grip players who are not prepared or have their desired action taken. The pressure to make optimal moves can be a little daunting, especially when you have to factor in the other players.

I love the variety the occupation and minor improvements add to the game. Sometimes a great combo will pop up and sometimes you will be stuck with junk. There are plenty of variants, including drafting, that can create a more "balanced" experience.

Lookout Games have been thoughtful enough to hire a wonderful artist to produce lovely illustrations for the components. Unfortunately, this seems to have left no room in the budget for competent interface design. The decision to employ cards instead of tiles for the action spaces is mind-boggling. At least 90% of the text could have been done away with by smart use of icons. Agricola is a huge, cluttered mess on the table, and it's not easy to get a good overview of the game.

The game itself is Supermarket Sweep for nerds. Very, very good if you like that kind of thing. Scales from 2 to 4 perfectly but becomes practically unplayable with 5.

Superclassic. The game that makes me realize what amazing mechanism worker placement can be. It's easy to dismiss wp as a mechanism because it is so ubiquitous now but in Agricola the board can be so tight, there is so much planning but blocking keeps you constantly on your tactical toes. Like Catan, it is a classic german style game, seemingly harmless and both can be played in a leisurely way but both can also be played very cutthroat.

1 learning game, 4p - I liked it. It was "pleasant", the drama of whether or not some other player would pick the fireplace card I needed. I don't quite see why, thematically, I couldn't build that same fireplace. Still, I can see what all the excitement is about, though I don't feel the excitement myself. I have some quibbles, but I'll wait until I play it more. Tick, tock, tick, tock... Update over a year later: haven't played it again, and don't particularly want to. There is no way for me to attack other people's farms, for one thing.  I just have to do my chores. It reminds me a little of the Simpsons joke where Bart refuses to do household chores as he is vehemently playing his Chores video game. Maybe I have limited ability to enjoy euro puzzle-administrative resource management games?  When robots take over the earth, they will play this game, instead of robot-dancing? Who then will hear the trees falling in the forest? I like so many euros, but maybe not this subgenre. However, no less than 3,500 gamers here rate it a 10, "ALWAYS want to play", so I am slightly outnumbered, like the Omega man.

Feels so much like real life.  You think you'll have plenty of food in the future, just like how when we get a raise it seems like so much money at first, but as time/life progresses, expenses (food requirements) increase too.  

Drafting is essential and makes the game more strategic than tactical.

Agricola is complicated and has a major learning curve, and I prefer games that are easy to learn but take a while to master.  However, once one gets a handle on the rules, this is a very interesting economic strategy game with many options to explore.

I don't care if it is super hyped, it is tons of fun.  We had it at a 9 for a while, but we think it deserves the 10.  As a family game, it seems boxed in, but it was our first time with more than 2 players and it was a blast! Our first pre-ordered game.

As a solo game, it is a decent puzzle, but not really much of a game.

Pastoral worker-placement Uwe Rosenberg game that is both pleasant and frustrating in ways. The theme, game mechanics, and engine building all satisfy. On the other hand, the tension over feeding workers is often too tight (to the detriment of fun) and my engine building is just starting to really bloom and then the game ends. See also comparison in Caverna comments.

This is the buzz game of the moment, I've tried it a few times now and I can't say any time it has particularly wowed me.  Yes it's a solid game, and the design is fine, the gameplay works, and the cards give the game a nice flavour, but I have two main gripes.

1) The game is all about the cards, but it's usually only in your interest if you're trying to win to build a few of them out.  If I get loads of cards which sound interesting, I want to build them all out.  Knowing that doing so will mean I won't win just makes me frustrated.

2) The cards are quite swingy.  Sure you can say that in general they average out, and over a long time you could probably say they would do.  But there are cards there that are worth loads of VPs for no effort, and cards that are basically useless.  What you get is random.


Edit: Played it yet more times now, my comment on swingy ness of cards is only really applicable in the K deck, I think this game plays much better with the E or I deck

I wish my group hadn't played this out before I got into it.  I love it and would probably play it every week if possible.  The struggle just to survive just feels good, especially when you achieve it and then some.  Perhaps I'll play more single player games of this.

RATING: 8
Excellent game.  It is a classic and, as far as I am concerned, sets the bar for worker placement games.  Great 2 player game.  I love that you can play the more advanced game with the cards or just the family variant with out them.  Has great depth but it all flows so well that it isn't complicated.

All the fun of basic accounting classes wrapped up in a time/space conundrum. How can a game be simultaneously too long and not long enough? This type of game should be done in an hour and a half (seems to be a sweet spot), but instead manages to drag our over the space of about 2 and a half hours. On the other hand, you never have enough time to do what you need/want to. You get a random hand of cards that either win the game or screw you from the get-go, scads of little boards to consume table space and turn after turn you get to watch as the one action you really need (the only one that will actually do you any good at all, in fact) is taken by someone else.

I would rather re-watch Soul Plane than play this again.

A fine, well crafted game.  From the meticulous production values to the the actual flow of game play from round to round, this game is a winner.  It remains to be seen if this game will sit next to my other favorites.

Update:
Will only play this game with 2 or 3, and only if common ground can not be found on a better game.  I think this is a good gateway game (the theme pulls itself through its own complexity).

Update:
I think the family game might be better than the advanced game.

RATING: 6
I would like to rate this game higher, but I can't.

I appreciate how much work must have gone into making this huge game.  There was obviously a great amount of play testing and planning that went into it.  It is very well created and has a lot of replay value.  However, it just doesn't hit the spot of me.  I have only played a half dozen or so games - which leaves me wondering if the lights will flash with more plays.  

The choices are near overwhelming.  The paths to victory almost too many to count.  And that is where the game falls apart for me.  There is so much to think about that there seems no way to correctly determine the best choice during my turn.  There seems no way to discern who is in the lead and what choices I need to make to thwart the leader.  I am just 'guessing' the whole way through what the best option for my turn or what I need to choose just to keep it from another player. And, yes, I have even won...without any idea how I did it.  Lucky me.

It would seem the solution to this would be to play it more.  But how many times must I play before it seems less like guesswork?  I enjoy playing to a measure. I can see why it is highly rated.  It is a clever well designed game.  But for me I want a gaming experience where I feel like I know why I'm am making the decisions I am making and, if necessary, what I can do to undermine another player.  But with Agricola I just can't seem to see through the myriad of choices to understand why I should choose one thing over another.  It becomes "I'll take this and see what happens"...through the whole game.

I'm just not a fan.

Rating after 1 game just so I can get my intiial thoughts down.  Good game and well worth the wait.  I am not sure if it is the game to take down Puerto Rico or my personal number 1's, but it is a fun game. 

We felt the game played fast, almost too fast, but we were playing the family game.  There were a few moments of blocking and taking what the other person wanted but for the most part, we were able to get what we wanted.  In that sense, it just became a race to see who was more efficient.

There was a lot to think about and I took the shotgun approach.  I only took negative points for not having my fields filled.  It was a bit overwhelming to realize all the potential positive and negative points but I am sure with more time, it will become 2nd nature and more-crafted plans will develop.  I want to get a few more family games in before delving into the Minor Improvements and Occupations.  I think these items will help you focus a bit more on strategy.

I expect my rating to go up with more plays but I am comfortable with an honest 8.5 at this time.

Subsequent plays settles it at a 9.  The full version puts the family game to shame!

With more plays, this could rival Yomi as my favorite game. Every decision is interesting and critical, and the card play gives this game great variety. This game is so unforgiving, but it gets better and better with each game. I can see myself playing this game with old crotchety gamers when I myself am an old crotchety gamer. It has an unending supply of depth which I can see myself investigating for years to come. I just can't help but supply heaps of praise upon this game.

Agricola is a fine double stout in a world of lagers, and as such, requires proper preparation in order for you to enjoy its depth. While I love this game, it certainly is not for everyone. I was introduced to it after playing tons of Stone Age and some Manhattan Project and the 2-player Agricola. If you haven't played Stone Age, STOP READING THIS AND GET IT. If you like Stone Age or 2-player Agricola and want a deeper and more challenging experience, you will like Caverna for sure, and you will probably like Agricola also. If you like games that are difficult to be good at, then you might like Agricola.

This rating is after my initial play. It could change in the future depending on whether or not my initial fears and concerns turn out to be founded or not. For example:

There are lots of cards and lots of text in very small font on each one of those cards. Because there are so many cards, strong card familiarity is something that would take A LOT of plays to acquire. I see why all of the wooden bits are there but the number of cards in the game seems excessive. It feels like having five boards worth of Puerto Rico buildings - all different and all having a paragraph of text instead of a summary of their use. Yes that many cards would contribute to variety from game to game but when each card requires a paragraph's worth of text to explain its use, the game can very quickly bog down with players reading each card to see what it does. Puerto Rico doesn't suffer from this problem as, after a few plays, you learn what the buildings are and what they do because the same set of buildings is available in each game and you get reminded more frequently how each building works. Race for the Galaxy also doesn't suffer from this problem as it uses a symbol system to explain each card. Thus, once a player is familiar with the symbols, they can quickly tell what a card does. 

Also, at it's heart, Agricola seems like a path carving game where, after a few initial turns, you are almost "locked" in to a specific style of play for your cards and resources to interact in the most efficient manner possible and yield the best results. This quasi "locked" feeling kept me from really paying that much attention to the other players when selecting actions. The only thing I cared about was whether or not the action that most benefited me was available when it was my turn. This created the "multi-player solitaire" feeling that many people harp on Euro's about but which I had not truly felt in a Euro before until this game (that's including the usual targets that get indicted by many for being "multi-player solitaire" like Princes of Florence and Race for the Galaxy).

Further, the theme does nothing for me. (I've noticed that farming games in general don't work for me. Hacienda, for example, just isn't exciting to play.)

I'll see after a few more plays what changes and what doesn't and update my rating accordingly. Until then, my rating is a "5" with the strong possibility that it may drop unless my concerns are resolved by future plays. 

Update: The more I think about it, the fun I had while playing Agricola had a lot more to do with the conversations with the people I played the game with. The actual game was pretty boring to me and I don't find myself really wanting to play it again. So, I've updated my rating to a "4" as that better reflects how I feel about the game.

The 2008 version is so crammed full of stuff that despite dozens and dozens of plays over the last 2 years I've returned again and again in solo. I don't feel the game needs an expansion to round it out which speaks volumes of it's quality.

This is the game that got me interested in growing crops in real life. I will never get tired of expanding my house, feeding my family, raising kids, plowing, sowing, breed lifestock and building improvements. For a Eurogame, I think the theme really comes through. Me and my wife made our own resources and animals out of Fimo clay. I have played this game well over 20 times and I don't think I will get rid of it anytime soon. I have one concern though, sometimes it feels the feeding and points requirements are overly frustrating and punishing.

Good game, very fun and plays different each time.   Innovative mix of cards and worker placement.  It's a lot of fun to see your farm come together.  It reminds me of the joy I experience when playing a civ game and see what I've built.  

That said, why don't I rate the game higer then an 8?  I have three problems with the game:

#1 The starting cards can heavily influence who wins.
#2 Knowing all the different cards is a determinate advantage in the game.
#3 For a game with determinate luck factors, I would prefer a shorter game.

Scott Smith and Cosima Niehaus are probably the only two people I would play this game with (and they are fictional). Very linear, very scripted. While there is SOME variations with the occupation cards and such everything that scores you points is linear something that I am incapable of enjoying completely. If you want an Uwe game about farming pick Caverna.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The mental calculations and screwage in this family/gateway mid-weight game are exactly right. The game feels tight and balanced. Replayability is through the roof with the various occupation and minor improvements cards, that give just enough flavor to make each experience (and puzzle) that different to be enjoyabe.

The theme is serene and beautiful, the art is outstanding, and the components are good with a pimpage potential of outter space dimensions if one cares to do so.

What's not to like? A masterpiece. 

ps. 
It feels to me much better than Caverna because:
- common tiles instead of individual cards feels a worse mechanism
- the quest mechanism seems like a balancing act
- the fantasy theme is not my favorite in Euros

RATING: 4
I hate Puerto Rico, and yet can enjoy Agricola.  I'm not sure why; perhaps it's the replayability and analytical layer provided by the cards that makes work for me.  Also nice for a non-confrontational change of pace from my typical wargame fare.  Still, there's nothing here that really draws me in.

So far, I've played one 2-player "family" game and about 3 single player Solo versions.  I like the game and I think it's a fun change from Stone Age, another worker placement type game that I really enjoy.  I hope to bring my kids to the table for Agricola soon.  I kind of, though, regret not getting Caverna instead...but we'll see with time.

7-7-15 updating to a 9.  My 11-year-old and I have played this about 20 times in the last month.  It has seen our table more than Stone Age, which is surprising.  The game ends way too fast for us...both of us wishing it were twice as long.

I could always play Agricola. There are many things I love about this game, but only two that make it shine for me: the stress of making a plan come together and the endless strategies to victory. After a game, there is always the thought of "I could have done better if I had just..." And it makes you want to break it out again the following night. 

We've played enough to get gameplay down to about 20-25 minutes per player, so it's certainly a bearable amount of time and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Though, this is due in part to the vast amount of things you're trying to accomplish. This game is amazing and hands down my favorite euro that I own.

RATING: 6
Its a fun game, and I applaud the effort to create an asymmetric game with high replay value. Here, the variability of the cards dealt is the main mechanism for that. The problem is that this also introduces a fair bit of luck. As much as some people want to insist that "all the cards are balanced" they really aren't. There are some cards or card combinations which, if you're fortunate to draw them in your hand...you'll have an advantage in the game.

But the game is long enough and there are enough places to incrementally overcome someone else's advantage that it doesn't bother me. I guess you'd say I can acknowledge the luck factor, but still enjoy the journey.

The theme seems to really hold up, surprisingly.  I guess my biggest quibble is that the scoring seems a bit clunky at the end of the game, and is hard to line up with the theme. It seems a little arbitrary, the things that give points, but the game itself works well enough with that system.

Update:  Played with card drafting and all the decks mixed together.  I didn't choose this method, but went along. Yuck, painful and not fun. I'm enjoying each play of Agricola less than the last one.

(Played with the card decks only, I would refuse to play the game without them, and the rating would drop to something like 3, not because it would be utterly terrible as such, but because I would never want to play it without the interest and variability that the cards offer up and would feel like I was wasting my time sitting at the table playing a castrated version of the game)

I had almost no interest in this game for quite some time, and it wasn't even on my active radar going into Essen. The enthusiastic response that people have had to it made me take a closer look though, and I am pretty impressed with this game.

Agricola is another one of the endless worker placement games that have come out recently. In this case, the twists are very good though. In short, each player has an individual mat which shows a farm yard. Over the course of the game, they will try to fill that mat with fields, fenced in animal areas, and a house. The worker placement scheme, in this case, expands each round, with another action becoming available at the start of each round. As the game passes, more valuable things and/or more powerful actions becomes available. At the end of the game, you score points for scads of different things: i.e.: having some/a lot of the 3 types of livestock, having spare grain or vegetables, filling up your board, having fields, having a nicer house for your family, having a larger family, &c. 

The big twist is the card decks. At the start of each game, the players are each dealt 7 occupation cards and 7 minor improvement cards. These all allow you to break the rules in some way, and require actions and often resources to build. There are hundreds of these cards, and the game plays very differently based on what cards you have and how you combine them.

In game terms, this has almost everything I like about Caylus, but adds a significant amount of player differentiation into the mix, which to me adds interest. The cards are a touch on the random side in that they don't seem to be at all balanced, and having certain combinations can be powerful, which means that I need to play it more to see how much they swing the game one way or the other, but I think the negatives are worth the much more abundant positives in this case. 

This game initially makes one feel like there isn't nearly enough time. 14 rounds, and only a couple of actions each round until you can grow your family. Harvests, which require you to feed you family (which can be a minor or a major undertaking depending on your cards, current board, &c.) happen more and more rapidly as the game goes, and it seems like you can never do enough, at least initially. The more I have played the game, the less stress these sorts of things cause though, and I have gotten to the point now where I'm pretty comfortable with the system and can easily prioritize actions efficiently and I've also gotten much more effective at using my cards. This takes a bit away from the game for me, because part of the initial allure was the sheer brutality of the system.

On an aside: this is one of the better worker placement games out there, but I am a touch tired of that style of game in general. I can understand the fervent fan base this game has generated, but it's one of those titles that I don't think I need to own, mainly because everyone and their brother is going to have a copy. My opinion might eventually rise, but I remember being just as enamored with Caylus when it first came out, and that quickly faded off the local tables as well. Presently, I think Le Havre does this type of game a touch better because it doesn't have the personalized randomness of the card decks and the unknown factor of the available actions. The latter would easily be fixable if the group just opted to play with that information open, the former is much harder to tackle, and I think it can be quite significant in the end game results because of the amount of points a synergistic hand can generate vs. a non-synergistic one.

What a fantastic game!  The cards at the beginning really help to keep it fresh playing over and over.  And what a deliciously tense struggle for actions - there's never enough of anything to go around.  I love the depth, the mechanics, and it is easy to grasp and enjoy.  I would strongly recommend you give this a try.

Plan ahead or else!  This is a great game that keeps you on your toes.  A lapse in concentration could lead to begging for food (feeding your family is very important).  While I really like the game mechanic (reminds me of Caylus) I have a problem with the balance of the minor improvement and occupation cards.  Some of the cards are useless while others are very powerful.  Add the ability to combine cards into insanely powerful combos and you end up with a game that can be very unbalanced.  That being said, part of the fun is making the best out of the hand you are dealt. If you enjoy a challenge then Agricola is a good game for you.  If you have problems with balance issues and need to win to have fun then you may want want to look elsewhere. As far as the Puerto Rico vs. Agricola issue.....I like both games but feel PR is more balanced (BOTH GAMES ARE GREAT though).

Likes: There's a lot to manage, but so few turns to get what you want done! You lose points if you neglect aspects of your farm.

Dislikes: Not one of my top Euros, good luck trying to convince people to play this based on the theme. The cards seem a bit too random to me, some are just more powerful than others and it sucks if you get a bad hand (perhaps a drafting variant could fix this).

Maybe I missed something but I found moves were usually blocked (on purpose or not) making it hard to get a strategy going in the base game. Moves blocked because of turn order was annoying. The base game felt like it was missing something but adding more cards overcompensated for this and over complicated things. 

2nd play: it's a better game than I first thought but not sure about the top rating.

Agricola is an absolutely amazing game about building and developing a farm. Without repeating others earlier commenting the game, I just would like to take emphasis on my own unique experience with Agricola: the game can be played both by hard core geeks and casual gamers, too. You can take it deadly serious or just play it for fun. And that is what I like the most about Uwe Rosenberg's game.
The artwork always amuses me and the variability and replayability of the game is extraordinary.

Played this at Gamex 2008 in Los Angeles. While I felt a little overwhelmed at first as this was the first heavy-weight game I had played at the time, I enjoyed myself and I kept thinking about the game afterward. The theme didn't really grab me, but the various and numerous card combination is really amazing and reminding me of magic in a way. You'll never have the same game twice and you'll always have new strategies to play out based on your cards. Also reminded me of the Race For The Galaxy card game in that aspect. The components, wooden cubes and disks, were a little too utilitarian though, but definitely a game I'd consider buying.

In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Some say having to feed your family is a broken mechanic, but it's what makes this game fun for me.  There are many routes to getting good scores, but you still have to have a plan on how you're going to feed your family in the end.  Some say that encroaches on their desire to be able to do whatever they want and that's why they pick Le Havre or some other worker placement game, but for me, it's that extra complexity that makes this game the best.  The massive card decks are the cherry on top which make each game a very new experience.

RATING: 4
Our first play of this game was the family version. I hated it. After some time and more experience playing harder games, we pulled it back out and played the regular version. It was better. It still is not one of my favorite games, but I don't hate it anymore. The animeeples help a lot. (I think the publisher was kind of cheap to not include them in the first version of the game.) One thing that really holds this game back for me is having to diversify to avoid negative points. It feels restricting and gives the game a negative mood. Final opinion: not a bad game, but not a great game either.

At first I thought that I didn't like worker placement games.  Then I played Caylus and loved that game.  So the problem is Agricola.

The best worker placement game. It keeps amusing me how fun this game is, how flavorful it feels, and unlike some other people I do not play without Occupations or Minor Improvements. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cons:
- Frontloaded information overload. You start off with 7 occupations and 7 minor improvements. Trying to figure out how to use those cards is a lot to process right at the beginning of the game. Especially for a beginner. 
- Accidental hate. Sometimes you will pick an action just to spite another player, but more often than not, taking the 6 wood was just the best move for you; nevermind that the next player can't feed his family now.
- I suck. Probably the biggest con.

Pros:
- Good introduction to some action economy. 
- Good amount of variety with occupations/improvements. Just wish they could be introduced in a more piecemeal way rather than all at once.
- Despite what I said about the accidental hate, you do have to account for it and think strategically about what your opponents might do.
- Good sense of power and progression. You start off wondering how you're going to get all the food you need to pulling off some powerful turns and filling your empty board with farms and cows.

Note: only ever played with 3 or 4 players.

Agile, and very well balanced.
The best of this game is that it is intrinsically fun.
My major complain is that getting a decent crop is soo hard and slow for a game named "agricola".
The second complain is that your farm is in fact a "micro-farm" and you are unable to develop anything while trying to develop everything at the same time. The need for food sets partial goals that doesn't match at all with the end-of-game goals. In this sense, I prefer the worker placement of Caylus as it has much more synergic and elegant development.

I know this one is up the top of the rating scale on boardgamegeek.com, however I just didn't enjoy it the first time I played. Granted I didn't play well the first time I played, however I'd much rather play Stone Age or Puerto Rico as these are vastly superior in my view. I also don't rate the artwork at all on this game, and all the cards/board etc is that slightly dark green?!

I will however put this down to some kind of bad first impression. Would like to play again and then reassess.

Interesting efficiency game with nice theme. I like the look of the game, the components and the theme (rating +1). The game is a bit complex, especially with occupation and improvement cards, which makes the game  difficult to teach and easily leads to analysis-paralysis (rating -1). The strongest and weakest aspect of the game are the cards. They add replayability and force players to use different strategies (rating +2). On the other hand, there are obviously much better and much worse card draws, which is a real issue in an efficiency game (rating -2). I would not like to play the game without the optional card discarding rules, which add extra setup time but mitigate the randomness of the card draws somewhat. The game is surprisingly good for solitary play (rating +1) although the experience is very different from multiplayer games.. 

I have animeeples and and I am not afraid to use them, moo ! :)

Rating +Farmers of The Moor.

Generally I don't think there are a lot of games that deserve a 10, because every game shall have its (minor) flaws and Agricola is not an exception. But after 6 years of play, endless hours of thinking about strategies and still discovering new cards resulting in long after-game discussions if it was really the card itself or the support for another card in a never-made combo, it strikes me how much this game still stirs us. 

Looking at the definition that BGG gives for a 10 I do think Agricola deserve it greatly. I’m pretty sure that it will take a long time before I find a game that keeps us moving as long as Agricola.

Knocked rating down a bit after playing its "successors."

"Replaced" by both Agricola:  All Creatures Great and Small and Caverna--both variations of Agricola that I enjoy more.

Good game, but a bit brutal for me (and I like brutal games).  I just don't enjoy the "fight" for the food engine all the time.  Sometimes, I just want to play a game and try to win--not to survive.

 Agricola is an okay game.  It has similar aspects to games like Caylus, combined with the CCG elements of games like Race for the Galaxy or even Through the Ages.

Problem is I'd much rather play any of those games.  Agricola just didn't interest me that much.  I never felt any of the tension that I get from Caylus or TtA, or the sense of vision and wonder I get from TtA or Race for the Galaxy.

Also, the scoring seems incredibly arbitrary (Grain is more useful than vegetables, but vegetables are worth more vp?  Really?).  It SEEMS like there's a lot of ways to earn vp, but ultimately you pretty much need the cookie-cutter equally diversified farm to win.  

And I think the card play detracts from the game rather than adding to it.  I don't have this "I miss MtG" itch that needs to be scratched and having a poor starting hand really sets you up for two and a half hours of non-competitiveness.

At that length there are so many other games I'd rather play.

And you know what ... I'll just go and say it.  It's frickin' ugly.  I can't stand the look of it.  And I hate to say it but that's a factor too.  Color me human.

Finally got to play this, and it is pretty cool.  The first game emphasized that there are strategic depths to this game that are going to emerge over multiple plays- for example, I didn't manage to add a family member until the very end of the game.  As I get to play it more, I'd bet my rating will improve.

One of my first BGG-informed purchases.  I love the tight decisions and shorter play time of this excellent game.  It always leaves me feeling like I could have used just one more turn!  I do not love the amount of put away time and have been thinking of possibilities to ease this process.

The more I play this the less I like using the cards.  They add too much luck and randomness and can result in a very unbalanced game.  Play is much tighter and rewarding of strategy with no cards.

I'm using 2 larger sized daily pill containers to store animals and other small resource bits.  We've found these make the bits much easier to deal with during all phases of the game.

Sept. 13th, 2008 -- While there's a lot going on in this game, it doesn't strike me as anything new or exciting. I'd probably be willing to play this on occasion, but it's not one I'd buy. For me, it didn't live up to the hype. 7/10

Played again tonight.  We play a lot of 2 player Agricola, my wife and I, and we really like it.

She is a straight forward player, almost always scores something around 40 points (more or less).  I am much more "experimental" trying out things. My scores vacillate wildly, but hey it is always fun.

This is an excellent game. The immense variety with the occupation and upgrade cards give this game a lot of replay value. Almost every decision seems important, and there are many ways to achieve victory. The only thing that might drive you crazy about this game is that it ends JUST when you really feel you are starting to get somewhere.

My wife has made me play this game with her about 40X in the past 6 weeks!  If not for this, I would have probably given this game a higher rating, as I am getting a little bit sick of playing it all the time (thankfully her obsession has shifted to Puerto Rico, which I consider to be a superior game).  I have won every single Agricola game except for one against her, but there have been times that I groaned and cursed through the experience anyway.
The problem with Agricola is that the desperate need to constantly feed your people takes some of the fun away from the game.  I know that difficult games should be more enjoyable, but Agricola has a way of becoming frustrating as you try to balance running the farm "as required" and experimenting with Occupations and Minor Improvements.  
This game is brilliantly designed though and very pretty.  It has led me to Le Havre by the same designer which I enjoy quite a bit more.  We are planning on collecting most of Rosenberg's games now as a result of being exposed to these two.  

Changed rating from 8 to 9, 8 months later after playing Caverna,  which I found to be a bloated mess.  Oddly enough,  the things I disliked about Agricola, which Caverna tried to "fix" (the stress and sense of urgency, the limited available choices, occupation and minor improvement cards) suddenly became valuable to me in their absence.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Update:
I've now played a bunch of times, and the rating stays. I actually thought it would go down, but the sheer vastness of the cards keeps it virtually endlessly interesting (well, I'm not one of those people who play it 100+ times). More surprisingly, it went over really well with my family. After watching a couple games, even my 7 year daughter started playing (with a handicap of starting resources). And although my wife fell asleep during rules explanation, she said she loved it, and requested it later, which is rare. But dang it's a PITA to put away.
---
Finally played. Yeah, great. So far I've only played with people who have played a lot. I think my rating might go up more if I get a chance to play with people that are still exploring the game, like I am. One of the more interesting aspects to me is that although there are like 10 different ways to get points, all of them are linear, and you are penalized for not having at least some of everything, so it's a bit unusual in that it strongly encourages breadth over depth, keeping everything valuable to everyone.

I'm so loving this game. The theme is very nice implemented, and it really feels like you're building your own farm.

It has great components (although I'm very disappointed with the quality of the Dutch gameboards (999-games).Despite of the great wooden animeeple, I like my customized fimo even better. 

There are so many options/strategies to play this game, that I think it won't bore me for some time. The cards just add more variation/strategies. But can add luck to the game. You can take a bit of the luck away by using a drafting variant.

I have played it with 2 and 3 people, and both are very good. Besides that it is also fun to do solo.

Some minor points about the game are the fact that you need to have a bit of all, and that one wants to do more than one can do in a game. But that's just really me being a perfectionist and wanting a perfect/complete farm :P

Agricola is at heart a surprisingly simple and 'shallow' resource engine game, with the ways to obtain the various goods and products you need surprisingly simple to obtain. Agricola employs a different way of creating a semblance of depth: giving the players a godawfully big choice of cards which have the potential to change their little games to a major extent. It is then obvious and easily understood that you don't really [i]want[/i] complexity: the game would be a logistic nightmare, and much better suited to computers than humans. Agricola is many, [i]many[/i] different simple games rolled into one. Take for example the harvest phases. These are basically a simple and crude drain on your economy, and force you to spend quite a number of resources on cards and improvements you don't actually [i]need[/i] save to avoid getting a rather hefty penalty which will most likely cripple you in the end. The large number of Knizian ways to score and lose points? A consequence of the flexbility in setting up your economy. But at the same time it becomes rather hard for players to intuitively decide that someone is ahead or no. The relatively very high price of expansion of your family? Simple: extra actions are worth a lot, so the game introduces a major barrier to see you profiting from extra actions only in the long run. All in all, despite a cute exterior—especially if one is artistic enough to replace all game parts with models made from polymer clay—a slightly deeper glance reveals a very 'gamey' side which in my opinion could have been hidden a little better. I'd much rather see a small selection of truly interesting cards than a large selection of variation on a theme.

I cannot say what effect the randomisation of the cards will have on the game of individuals. It is by no means a given that a good combination will actually appear as the action choices leading up to their playing-out are limited too. It might not be the best course of action to focus on those cards, or rather, it might not yield the largest amount of points. But this can only be established by playing the game with the same cards again. I have no idea how that will affect everything, but the answer may actually be quite surprising. I can see certain individuals analyse this game to death in order to figure out optimum card configurations, which would be complete and utter waste of time if you ask me, but hey, it's their time, not mine. As for myself, I will probably play this game once every while; therefore the variety is completely wasted on me. This is a game for people who want to play the same game over and over and over and over again, making it simply not my game.

[b]Update[/b] Two years after writing the above I still stand by it, to within 95% or so. In the meantime I've become acquainted with other resource engine games like At the Gates of Loyang, Glen More, and Endeavor. These captivate me more for a number of reasons which can be objectively established:
— simpler rulesets, 
— clearer scoring,
— normal quantities of game material, and
— sufficient [i]interesting[/i] variety for what I consider a normal lifespan of a game (< 100 games).
Agricola only wins out in terms of interactions, as the actions become blocked over the course of a round, meaning that timing your needs is an integral element of the game. I'm not even sure the variety is there after 100 games or so: of course there are truly humongous amounts of card combinations lurking in the box, but whether these are [i]interesting[/i] is another matter: the action cards are not altered, after all, in fact remain quite scripted. I realise that's a pretty cheeky statement to make, and shouldn't be confused with the existence of 'cookie cutter strategies' and such. It has more to do with the fact that family growth isn't available in the first quarter of the game, pigs not until the second half, cattle not until the final quarter, and so forth. It forces the game into several similar patterns, with cards allowing the players to bypass these to a certain extent. In essence, the cards force a non-neglegible puzzle element into the game not unlike that found in for example Shipyard or Die Burgen von Burgund.

It isn't that Agricola is a bad game; it's just that other games do away with a lot of the material and condense things into shorter, streamlined packages.

So far so good.  Really my main complaint is that because the choices of what action to take conflict, you are sometimes at the whim of the other players.

But interaction makes the game a combined experience, which of course it needs.  I enjoy the ability to do whatever I want and let others debate on the intelligence of the choice.

Was fun for a while, but the combination of worker placement with a whole gazillion of cards isn't really my kind of fun. Especially not when all the farms end up looking more or less the same in the end, and it's mostly a question of making it a bit quicker/more efficient than the other players. And I want more interaction in the WP games I play (Dominant Species, Vanuatu, Keythedral, even Caylus), at least when they are of this weight and length.

This is a love it or hate it game, and boy do I hate it. It's not that it's a bad game. Clearly it is quite good overall based on its rankings. But to me it just feels like work, and there are too many decisions to make and it can just be too punishing if you don't make the correct decisions. It wasn't for me and there are other worker placement games I prefer way more, so I traded my copy away. I'd be perfectly fine with never playing again to be honest.

RATING: 7.5
August 2008.  Yes I pre-ordered sight unseen and fell for the hype.  My favorite type of game is worker placement which this one is superb.  The theme is very enjoyable and works well with the game play.  This game has instantly shot to the top of my favorites to play.  Since I'd play again right now given the chance, the rating is correct.

November 2008.  Now that I've had a few plays under my belt I can give it some critical judgment:

1) Don't enjoy playing more than 4 player.  Having too many people or too many new players really slows down this game.
2) Wife won't play game with cards so it loses a lot with the limited way the family plays with it.
3) Theme is great and works well with my young family.
4) Decreased my rating from 9 to 8 since the possibilities of varied game play is very low which gives it less appeal.  As ranking of all worker placement games, I think the theme helps this one, but Caylus is more strategic and interesting to me.
5) Still think Power Grid should be the top of BGG.

2009-May - Moving this one down a bit in my worker placement rankings.  Still a very fun game, but the feature I dislike the most is that you have to be balanced in your scoring.

2009-June - Decreased rating again.  7.5  Not a bad game, but since my wife doesn't like it much and I like other worker placement games more, this one gets neglected.  I think I'd sell/trade the game now if it wasn't the theme the kids like.  I think the biggest issue I have with the game is that you have to do a little bit of everything so each game seems samey.

2010 - February - Wife despises whole world after playing this game.  Maybe some day.

This is one of those games that is "inherently" fun. By that I mean that there is something intrinsically fun about performing the actions in this game--growing grain, breeding farm animals, plowing fields, building houses--it all gives you that certain sense of "accomplishment" (kind of like delivering goods in Railroad Tycoon, or checking an item off your "todo" list) and makes the game fun. The game is very tactical, and it's tough to look at your options in any given round and formulate a solid plan to move forward, but despite uncertainties of card draws and your opponents' actions, success in Agricola is firmly rooted in skill and experience. It's the first game since BattleLore that my wife and I have played 6 times in a single day.

Edit: At the 10-play mark, I've decided that the game is far more tactical than strategic. There is a somewhat fuzzy strategic element (e.g. "breed lots of animals" or "sow lots of fields"), but it's mostly tactical. And once you start getting used to the game, analysis paralysis is reduced even with occupations and minor improvements present.

Either way it's an extremely fun game.

I have owned this game for a while and played it maybe 10 times. There are mixed opinions in our group as to whether the family version is better due to the luck factor of the draw of minor improvements and occupations. We play the family more often not due to this but to the fact that there seems to be a new player most of the time if not many. We have yet to try the non family version on new players but this could be an option I suppose.

This game is a perfect integration of theme with mechanics. What you are doing makes sense and you can see your board position growing. However winning is hard and requires you to evaluate whether you want short or long gains, the hallmark of a great game. 5 is too crunchy and usually one player gets left in the dust, 2 is a bit too harsh as zero sum play becomes more pronounced, 3-4 players is just beautiful. The family game is good, but the minor improvements and occupations take it to a whole new level. The only gripe I have is that the family game tends to be the one I play most, as there are almost always new players and it is solvable without the variation provided by the minor improvements and occupations.

Great strategy game that can be won any number of ways. It can appear that nothing is happening until late in the game where all the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards create huge bursts of point scoring and farm building. Part of the reason I don't have it rated any higher is that for the most part your strategy is going to be completely  determined by the hand you're given at the start of the game. That said, you can win the game with any hand you're given...

Having previously raised this game's rating from an 8 to a 9, I now feel compelled to raise it to a 10.  The impetus for this was the fact that I recently mentioned to a friend "my entire game collection is useless--all I want to play is Agricola."  The theme really makes the game here, and the huge variety of cards promises that it is likely to remain fun for a long time to come. I prefer the E and K decks.  I found the I deck a lot less fun.  I've enjoyed the game immensely when playing with 3, 4, or 5.  The two player game was not as fun for me.

Worker placement game working on expanding your farm.  I love the replayability the cards dawn give each player.  It gives a different strategic path to take each time.  The only frustrating part of this game is not being able to do everything!  You've got to pick and choose how you want to get your points and what points you're willing to sacrifice.  Love how it make you think!

Wonderful, engaging, entertaining. It's a bit stressful, trying to plan ahead and feed your family at the same time, but that stress in no way detracts from the high value of this game.

Want to try using the draft variant for occupations and improvements.

The hype is definitely there, but the game feels solid. There is tons of cards to play and memorize and the game is definitely conceived to accommodate many, many future expansions ala 'Magic: The Gathering" (not necessarily a strong point in my opinion, for a variety of reasons). I'll give it a solid 8 after my first play with the potential to go both ways.

Update: I prefer the 'familiy version' over the regular game. Too many cards, too much confusion. I am also dropping this to a 7 (down by one). Caylus is better.

Update: Caylus is still better, but I rate this an 8 again. I want to play it more and more.

Update: I still hate the cards, but like the game.

Sure its about farming ,but if you get into the spirit
of the game you start to really care about your family not starving or having to beg. With the added heat element as well you have one pretty nail biting game on your hands. Would probably be turned off by the game if I was a farmer in real life ,but I`m not which makes this type of decision making exciting IMO.

I love playing with a variety of people and Agricola caters to a large audience of people. The different decks keep the game fresh and allow for extra chalenge for more experienced players or pull out the E deck for the people just learning.

How many games come with the variety of game options that this does? How many games allow you to scale from playing solo up-to 5 people?  

My wife doesn't like playing many board games but she looks forward to playing Agricola and that is sufficient for me to give it at 10!

RATING: 10
Agricola is my favorite Euro game of all time - especially when played with The Farmers of the Moor expansion.  Amazing replayability!!!  Fantastic game with 2,3,4 or 5 players as the games scales very well!!!  This heavy thinker Euro style game is the type of game that is an addiction as once you play the game 5 to 10 times. Agricola grows on you until you wish to play it more and more and more! My extended gaming group almost always plays the "deal 10 cards - keep 7" variant option for play balance to give all players a reasonable chance of a good group of cards each game.  For variety there are other expansion decks which I own, but I feel they tend to introduce rules conflicts and are best played on their own.  Lastly, Agricola creates the dynamic of "if only I had one more move or turn".  Each player is forever clawing at getting what they need - usually barely in time - making for tense play while desiring to push the limit every round of play.

I've played this quite a bit, and I have a good time playing it, when I do, but lately it seems to be a chore to think about succeeding at the mechanics, especially with the cards. The game doesn't seem as fun to me, but rather more frustrating to know that all the choices are among bad and other bad options. I can't seem to get others really interested in it which is also a big drawback for me, since I'm not going to play it solitaire all the time. Still a great game, though.

RATING: 2
Lopsided card drafts, long term planning foiled and seriously sidetracked  by dumb luck by other players cards, a game where you love having to pay attention to the trivial over and over, making small progress, yet still having to maintain the status quo. It is exhausting, mind numbingly dull playing this thing. Gave it a 2 over a 1 because a 2 defines this game so well. 

This game could be reworked to fix this.

Caverna: the Cave Farmers didn't fix this. Agricola is at least a game, one that feels dated, Caverna is nothing more then a church group activity wrapped around a lot of chrome.

I enjoy playing Agricola as a solo series as described in the rulebook. First reading it, I thought it would be boring.... After actually playing, it is a lot of fun and my strategy constantly changes depending on which occupation and minor improvement cards I am dealt. If you get the required points for the game you carry over one occupation card with you and you need to score more points to win the next game in the series.

Like:

-The theme.  It's very soothing and appealing to me.
-The multitude of paths to victory.
-Variations in each game caused by a ton of cards that are packed in with the base game, with the option to buy more decks for even greater variety.
-Love the wooden components and crisp card quality, though some of the art is a little cartoony for my taste.
-Pretty much everything - this is my favorite game.

Don't Like:

-The frustrating final rounds where players (including myself) tend to wrap themselves up in a blanket of AP and simply glare at their farms.

Got this for Christmas in 2007. I have not played it enough by far (about 15 times by now), but I like it very very much. Have replaced the original cubes with vegimeeples, resourceeples and animeeples, which really helps the game because you can actually differentiate the stuff.

If only it wasn't so inelegant and fiddly – I would have rated it a solid 10. Or 11.

My 'heaviest' game; I don't think I'll go beyond this in terms of compexity.

EDIT: Rating has gone down since I don't play it that much anymore. A tad too heavy for me maybe?

This is an excellent game. I can see why its #2 on board game geek. As soon as I'm done playing, I'm ready to play again. 

After playing recently, once again, I am impressed with this game. Like chess, every move must be carefully considered. One wrong move may cost a few points in the end. And a few points is usually the difference in the game. Players all feel a strong sense of tension because it takes many steps to build out a strategy. 

Caverna has replaced this game for us. I'm trying Agricola as a solo game.

Game itself is fine, as far as it goes.  But this is the most idealized 'Dark Age' I've ever seen.  Disney could make a movie about Agricola, with dancing sheep and cows, and singing maidens as they build new cottages to house thier prospective young ones.

Its just not about anything- its just another multi-player solitaire process game.  Admittedly, its a very GOOD multiplayer solitaire process game.  But totally not my cup of tea.

A very good one resource management game, and the first hit  of Uwe Rosenberg, his creator. A mix between worker placement alla Caylus, and personal board management alla Puerto Rico with thousands of cards in order to build up the most beautiful and functional farm and feed your family/worker team. I like the way you have to search to play the cards but sometimes your score depends too much on the cards you recieve at the begining of the game. It isn´t my favourite game but I enjoy every time I play. Maybe my favourite in the "multiplayer solitaire" category.

After about half a dozen plays, I can say that I enjoy Agricola quite a bit, and that it looks like it'll have a huge amount of replayability. That being said, I don't think it'll become one of my all-time favorites, though I've certainly been wrong before about that sort of thing.

The only (minor) gripe I have is with the logistics of adding to the various accumulated resources every turn; later in the game, there's a lot of stuff to add, and it's easy to miss/forget something.

[12/08: There's even more varied dynamics than I'd thought; the different actions available in 2/3/4/5-player games have a palpable effect on play. Neat.] 

[10/09: ...and earlier this year, my interest in the game kind of fell off a cliff, moreso than usual for "the shiny has worn off". Leaving rating in the 7-8 range due to earlier enjoyment.]

A good worker placement game.  I hadn't played Agricola for a long while but recently played it with some friends and we all had a blast.  While I think the mechanics are fine the way they are originally set up, perhaps the game could be even better if there was an opportunity to cycle through the minor improvement and occupation decks rather than just working with the original 7 cards you are dealt with at the beginning of the game?  Regardless, I'll still play this one, especially with non-gamers.

Although the theme is quite tame, since I LOVE Harvest Moon Video game, so I kinda dig it. But the beauty of this game is the magnificent interaction of human to human and to mechanism. "You need to do this and before that do that after that will do those" kind of feeling is so strong here. And the theme is integrated so well, so you can't just suddenly re-theme Agricola. Not only that, the replayability is HIGH, because of the cards.

Agricola is fun - there is no doubt about that. But after a few plays, with the novelty of the CCG mechanics gone and a better sense of its internal dynamics, it’s also shown a number of problems that prevent it from reaching hallowed status. 

Firstly, around the time you begin to become competent at it, the game also begins to feel highly repetitive. Part of this is the relative lack of viable paths to victory - that is, the game in large part is driven by the overwhelming need to grow your family as soon as possible. The increase in actions a family member gives you is simply so powerful that it trumps any other priority. That makes the early part of the game all about planning around the first family growth, which means building rooms, which means obtaining a large stockpile of wood and a smaller store of reed. And that means it plays out similarly and is ultimately determined by a combination of minutely superior choices about the tightly constrained key resources and some luck in positioning on the critical (unknown) round when family growth appears. The intense race for this space amidst the tight early game effectively eliminate players from contention earlier the game warrants, especially as later rounds become longer (due to more available actions and family members).

These above problems, I think, are magnified by the shoehorned scoring structure. The need for a balanced farm mean players are all gunning for similar ultimate goals. So once the early rounds are over, the game doesn’t open up into multiple victory paths. It becomes a race for ticking off scoring checkmarks, though the order for each player may differ. I also particularly dislike the large percentage of points given for family members. They ALREADY give you actions. By giving them such a large point value, it further reduces any tension as to whether to choose the family growth option if available (the small increased food cost nonwithstanding). At least with animals and plants, you do have some decisions to make, as their value as food conflicts with their value as points. So I wonder if removing these points might serve to open up the game a little, although I have my doubts. 

As for the cards. Oh, the cards. I loved the idea of them the first several times through. But again, around the time you become competent at the game, you begin to realize that they fail to live up to their promise of instilling infinite variety into the game. For starters, many of them are so weak or conditional as to be effectively useless. Others are simply far too good, especially those that simplify the race for family growth - for instance, those easing the early food burden, those increasing the amount of food or reed you collect, or those making early food engine growth more efficient. Again, the problems are those of variety and choice. Since most cards are uninteresting or have marginal effects, they do little to muck up the repetitive nature of the crucial early rounds; the more powerful ones are simply so good that they offer no hard decisions about whether to play them out. (I also wish the designers would have taken a page from the better card game designers and been far more precise in their wordings on cards; there are too many ambiguities in resolution).

The game also bogs down in the end rounds, as play devolves into point optimization calculations among competing available actions. This is unfortunate given that the game’s most meaty decisions have already been made and the winner largely determined, though I think unavoidable.  As a bonus, though, except for this point, the game actually feels highly thematic, which is quite an achievement given both the seemingly dull topic and the worker placement mechanics.

My personal "Game of the Year 2007"-there is simply no better game....there may be DIFFERENT games that are 'as good'-but none better. My 12-year-old won't play this because "it causes her too much stress"-MILLION things to do-not enough turns, not enough resources ESPECIALLY WOOD (what's with Uwe and the dearth of wood in all his games? Was he born without a wooden spoon in his mouth?)

Components: Nice artwork all around. The cards are too flimsy. There are too many wooden bits for them to be just cubes; upgrading to unique shapes is a must.

Experience: So many choices! The number of options available for my actions grows each round, though often not having enough of a certain resource (e.g. wood) will close off several types of choices for the time being.

It's fun, but it's also hard work; it's almost not worth it to expand my family because it's so difficult to feed everyone. Very challenging. There are always interesting things to do, but never enough time to do them. By the end of each game I feel I've been dragged through the coals.

The occupation and minor improvement cards are essential for making each game different, and for providing me with direction at the beginning.

I play as a vegan (never cooking my animals; pretending the fishing hole is for water cress, etc.). And this makes getting food very difficult. If my starting hand doesn't contain a food engine, I'm screwed.

Initial impression.  A tremendous array of combinations and possibilities provided by the card decks.  Tight, focused objective set enhances balance and approachability.  However, depth of strategy is largely tied to what cards are available to you on any playing, rather than any attributes of the game in general.  This "situational" strategy is not necessarily a negative, but the reason I reserve assigning a higher rating to the game.

Subsequent impression.  The game is a increasing constriction of options, as if you're being thrown down a funnel.  What becomes challenging with 2 becomes increasingly frustrating, as the number of players grows, until the game relies too heavily on simple opportunism, and planning becomes largely a matter of not sticking to any, one plan.

RATING: 8
I was sure this game was overhyped, but after playing it, I realized it's just amazingly good. Lots of different ways to win, and more player interaction than it gets credit for since only one person can perform each action each turn. It is almost a bait game when you play by the family rules (no occupations or minor improvements). I actually like the family rules better because it takes out the chance of the cards and it plays quicker. Of course, with the cards I can always blame my loss on the other guys great occupations instead of my ineptitude.

0902: After my first (family) game, hard to see what the fuss is about. The game does nothing original, but seems to be just a more involved version of any number of Euros. Removed from wishlist.
0908: Played a second time, two-player with occupation and minor improvement cards. Got whipped as I completely failed to develop in a sensible manner. I like the variability that having cards to shape a strategy will bring. I've borrowed the game to see if a few solo plays will make it click.

Loads of wood bits to move around, with lots of housekeeping between rounds. Huge variety in cards. Long decision trees sometimes make my head hurt, but I love it.

I love the *idea* of Agricola, but when it comes down to actually playing it, I just...  meh.  I find the harvest mechanics to be too punishing, and I dislike the scoring that basically forces you to do a little bit of everything instead of being able to specialize, particularly since everyone is competing for the same action spaces to try and build essentially the same farm that you are.  And the cards, which I know everyone raves about as far as adding replayability, just seem to be too *much* randomness for my taste.  I've not gotten rid of this post-Caverna; nor do I plan to.  It's still a good game, I just don't think it's a *great* one.

I love the versatility of this game. It's good for just me and my wife to enjoy a game, or to have friends over to play it. Each game is a little different and each game presents a challenge...I just never feel like I've mastered the strategy. The game moves fast and you feel like your starting to get your plans together about the time the game ends. Probably top 3 game for me.

RATING: 1
I dedicate this rating to everyone who hasn't yet played this game and gave it a 10 based on hype. I wanted to like it; I really did. Heck, I even bought this game after I thought that maybe I was missing all the fun because I didn't play it often enough.

Someone recently asked me if my opinion has changed about Agricola. It hasn't. In fact, it's gotten worse. A one indicates my personal reaction to a game is that I have no desire to play it. Ever. I've played it eight times now, with different groups of players, and each time is worse than the last.

It's way too fiddly and illogical to be entertaining, and the theme of French Medieval farming is, shall we say, uninspiring. What next, a game about simultaneously building wooden, iron, *and* steel ships in a French port while avoiding starvation, Mr. Rosenberg?

Yes, the mechanics of Agricola are interesting, but ultimately, the game as a whole is a dismal failure as fun, which is the primary reason for this rating.

[b]Thumbs Up:[/b] Yet another game that marries my favorite game mechanism (action drafting) with my least favorite strategic goal (do a bunch of things, get a bunch of points). But the theme goes a long way, and the best part is the HUGE number of special cards to play with, giving this game tremendous replayability and a lot of tension (as you won't be able to use most of those special cards you get). That's almost enough to get it to Top Shelf... but I find the refreshing of the resources to be a bit tedious.

The 2 usual problems- learning curve and a ton of fiddly bits. Another conversion game like Caylus.

And we didn't have anyone poring over the cards. Too long/expensive.

"Starvation simulator" puts it nicely. I always find it very tense, and sometimes your entire game plan can be ruined by someone taking the spot you needed which can be frustrating. Although there is no direct conflict in this game it is nevertheless very competitive. The cards can sometimes be a bit unbalanced - there are certain combinations that are extremely powerful. Excellent otherwise.

One play so far of this ultra-popular euro.  This was a fascinating experience - a game I felt was a bit similar in structure to Puerto Rico, but a 100% more satisfying experience due to the TEACHER that taught me the game.  The person who showed me how to play TOOK HIS TIME and really took care to teach me the aspects of the turns, etc. in great detail - AND WENT SLOWLY!  This improved my enjoyment of the tricky first play entirely better than my first Puerto Rico game.  I felt if this individual has taught me Puerto Rico, I'd be much more enthusiastic about THAT game, too.  As it is, Agricola is a fantastic game that I became hooked on and can't wait to play again.  Using the Animeeples (which I was lucky enough to use) is really essential to play, I find, as using bland discs would make the game feel like balancing a budget or something.  But the use of Sheeples, Wild Boars, Carrots, etc. really makes it feel like you are growing your own whimsical little world - it really brings the latent theme of the game out.

Nothing says 14th century farming fun like Agricola does.  Cubes, animeeples (amazing) - letting an animal live in your house but not eating it in the event your family don't have enough at harvest.  I do like this game.  If you like wooden cubes and farming - this is the game for you.  If you want a dungeon crawl - this isn't the game for you.  This could be described as the worst dungeon crawler of all time.  But I don't think that's what they were aiming for.

One sentence summary: Agricola is the [b]least favourite game I've ever had the misfortune to play in more than 45 years of gaming[/b] (and I have played some seriously awful games). But don't take my word for it, here are some other enlightened and honest opinions about Agricola ... 

[q]I'd rather watch paint dry or grass grow. -- gittes[/q]
[q]My memory of playing this game makes me want to barf. -- sbconstant[/q]
[q]Misery Farm. -- Unknown BGG member[/q]
[q]The Coldplay of modern boardgaming. Fucking boring and inexplicably successful. -- Abiezer Coppe[/q]
[q]I've never been waterboarded but I imagine the experience is comparable to Agricola. -- SamuraiBudgie[/q]
[q]I would rather trade an eye than play this game. -- WhimsicalOne[/q]
[q]All the excitement of 16th century farming. -- cooler king[/q]
[q]Goes down like a mouthful of runny sheep droppings. -- bob_the_goon[/q]
I'm a gamer's gamer. Been boardgaming as a hobby more than four decades. I love Euros and wargames. I [i]should[/i] like this one. Nope. Never again. Awful. Brutal, nasty, passive-aggressive, stressful, un-fun.

I'd rather undergo root canal work ... without freezing. I'd rather spend three hours in a quiet, dark corner poking myself in the eye with a dull pencil or rusty spoon while listening to Donny and Marie music. I would not play this game again even if you offered me US$1,000 (really). I'd rather play Candyland.

Technically, I should rate it a "1.1" since my opinion of the game somewhat matches BGG rating system definition for a "2" ... Extremely annoying game, [i]won't ever play this again[/i]. It's much closer to the definition of a "1" rating though, however it's not fully "broken" as a "1" rating requires (though the uneven luck-of-the-draw cards and absolute blocking mechanic [especially when this is done purely for spiteful reasons] pretty much do make it broken in my opinion, since there is no way to recover from these two things). But both of the other two requirements for a 1 rating certainly hold true ... Defies description of a game. You won't catch me dead playing this. Since I agree with two of the three criteria a 1 requires, a 1 is what it rates.

Agricola is the only boardgame I've ever quit half-way through a game (my fourth game, so three-and-a-half plays suffered through) because I was so crazy bored and stupidly frustrated with the absolute choice denial blocking mechanic and the ungodly slow pace and length this game takes. It's also a much meaner game than most of it's fans will acknowledge despite it's friendly little veneer, and it's a game that railroads you to having to do something with little variation in your choice of what to do. Any game that encourages the sort of behaviour where players yell out "I shall build fences just so you can't!" is nothing but a spiteful mind-fuck of a game, and a lot meaner than I want to play. 

Boring as hell. Never again, I can't even stand the sight of the game, honestly. 

I [i]have[/i] turned down money to play this game again. I hate Agricola that much. I absolutely refuse to ever play this "game" again.

Does it deserve it's high rating? I guess, and I do acknowledge that it is a very good game for many people, but I have no real idea why, since it's the complete opposite of fun in my opinion. Can I honestly and without malice rate it a "1" based on BGG's definition of a what constitutes a 1 or 2 for how I define/rate games? Absolutely.

RATING: 6
Resource management game with a nice amount of variety supplied by the tons of cards. I would describe the gameplay as more interestng than fun.

addendum: after a few plays, I have become tired of the game. The core system was initially interesting, but quickly became tedious. The cards, though helpful in adding some twists, did not do enough to keep the gameplay fun. I can see why some people have turned to creating their own pieces: they need to do something to keep the game interesting for just a bit longer.

I've played it twice, I really like it, but it's far too early to rate it any higher than this.  This one begs to be played more often.  The scarcity of actions make for a very brutal game.  I count it an accomplishment that I had all the spaces on my board filled in my second game.

The good thing about Agricola is that it is adaptable depending on the group. You can play the family game with beginners, just use the minor improvements if you want a faster game with a bit less luck, play with both minor improvements and occupations for maximum options (and chance to concentrate too much on cards and go horribly wrong!). Drafting the cards and/or allowing card exchanges are other, more advanced ways to play.

Rating as of Jan '15 - 6. Owned since Dec '13 and only 4 plays as of the time of this rating. My main gaming group doesn't seem initially impressed with the family rules. They would rather be playing Carson City or Dominant Species if we're looking for a Worker Placement game. It is a very tight optimization game, meaning that it feels like there are no good moves throughout the whole game. I think I need to play more with the Occupation cards to fully enjoy Agricola.

Things I like about Agricola: How neatly the components fit into the Plano box and within the original box. The animeeples are kinda cool.

Things I don't like about Agricola: Takes up a lot of table space. The fiddliness of setting up components between each round. The game takes a long time to explain. I feel like I'm always losing, and that nobody's ever winning.

A really deep strategic experience with nice integration of theme. Scales beautifully from 2 to 5 players and the vast array of minor improvements and occupations gives you almost infinite re-playability. You will find yourself competing with yourself and your past games as much as other players, trying to maximize every action you take. Always fun, always challenging, and I will always be up for a game.

An efficiency engine game, to be sure, but for me the cards at the beginning (occupations and minor improvements) add a bunch to the game, making it more than the standard snowball game.  It's only downfall is the play time, which makes it harder to get to the table in my typical playing environments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For my money, more than ten years post-release this game is still tops in the worker placement genre. Make no mistake, it can be outright BRUTAL, forcing you at times to scratch and claw in desperation just to feed your family, nevermind actually build up your farm. Play your cards right however and you'll see things fall into place late in the game, which is definitely a rewarding experience. This is one I'll keep going back to for a long time.

I think Agricola is a very well designed game, but it's just not for me.  To cut to the chase: I don't like how the tension (from feeding and from scoring) limits my ability to use my cards to make a cool combo.  I want more freedom, but not as much as is offered by Caverna, or Fields of Arle.

What makes Agricola shine is the cards: the occs, and the minor improvements.  Together, you can put together a cohesive and powerful strategy, but it generally requires some focus (e.g. focusing on clay and pottery, or on fields and grain).  If that focus is not on food production, you will lose.  If that focus doesn't get you a bit of everything, you will lose.

If, like me, you accidentally forget to get food for a round and you get three begging cards, you will lose.

I know how to play the game reasonably well.  Get a combo that gets you food more efficiently than just using the board actions, and use your leftover freedom to get everything else.  But that is not how I want to play it.

Conversely, I don't want to be able to do anything I want, like in Caverna.

What I want is to have the constraints and the suggested strategy from the cards, but without having to worry about aspects of the game that do not relate to my chosen strategy.

Plus, my wife hates farming.

Agricola is an excellent worker placement game, with a set of simple mechanics, but quite a bit of strategic depth. I have already gotten my money's worth out of playing the "family" version, and am excited to play with the minor occupations and cards. At risk of repeating other reviews, this game is a classic, and has earned a slot on any gamer's shelf.

June 5, 2010: Just played this for the first time last night--a 2-player game with my wife. I'm not ready to rate it yet, but I really, really liked it--as did she!

June 7, 2010: Played this the other night as a 4-player with my wife, my brother, and my brother-in-law. My brother and brother-in-law didn't seem to like it that much, and they had some difficulty catching on to the differences between grain and vegetables. I'd recommend teaching this game as a 2- or 3-player game. Anyway, my wife and I still really enjoy this game. I've even been having dreams about it, and we took a drive out in the country and all I could think about was Agricola. We still haven't played other than the family variant, but I'm gonna give this game a 10--and I'm the type of person that always wants to counter popular opinion and trend. I just love all of the options and planning and variability. Great game! I have to get Le Havre soon.

This is a very heavy strategic board game.  Fun to play with the right people.  Lots of strategies limited by what other people's strategies are and the worker placement board.  Downside is feeding your family.  It felt like I was always behind and trying to come up with the necessary food instead of building my farm up.  Other downside is negative points if you don't build/grow one of the items on the board.  this makes you have to do everything.  This is the mother of all board games for me.  Interaction with others can be almost zero to a lot depending on what cards are incorporated.  Components are very good and solid.  Great game with great mechanics but not for the casual gamer.  Games can last 1-2 hours.

I like Agricola.  The cubes representing the animals are dying to be replaced with properly shaped pieces.  I rarely play with the cards (beyond major improvements) because I'm always teaching it to someone new.  The cards themselves add a lot of variety to how you play the game, but you really do need to know how to play the basic (aka Family) game first.

Brilliantly enjoyable. A fun worker placement game with very little downtime. You're always doing something, and there are always (too many) things to do. I lose every time, but I don't care. There is a high degree of interaction, just not "take that!" interaction -- instead, competition. It's the prototype for "indirect conflict" euros. Only a 9 because there really is NO game I would ALWAYS want to play... but Agricola comes close.

A good game I'm terrible at, still hobbled by the standard Minor Improvement and Occupation rules (the winner had excellent combos).

This was the game that got me into the hobby. For a while it was my only modern boardgame, so I played it all the time and indeed, judging from the number of used scoresheets, it's probably the game I played the most in my collection.

I struggle with this one, I really do. Sometimes I think it's a smart, sharp game, and that it's a classic for a reason. Sometimes I get excited at the prospect of playing it. Sometimes I think trying to figure out what action is best to take when considering my long-term strategy versus what action is particularly delicious right now versus what I can reasonably expect other players to do is board gaming at its best.

But sometimes, when I really think about it, I feel like this game has a lot of problems. Maybe too many problems. Your starting hand of cards, regardless of what system you use to obtain them, can vary widely in quality from player to player and, player skill being relatively equal, the person with the best hand will win. However, somewhat paradoxically, a good card-based engine that requires more than a couple-three cards will take half the game to build, thereby wasting so much of your time that you lose. Family members are massively over-valued during game-end scoring; because they allow you to take extra actions and because they live in rooms that (usually) also get you points, they basically do triple work with respect to scoring. Getting to a point where you feel like you're not totally wasting every turn collecting paltry amounts of resources in order to spend them on paltry farm improvements can take way too long--sometimes three-quarters of the game--and I'm not sure I can praise a game that doesn't feel good for so much of its length. And some of the game systems (especially baking bread) are just plain overcomplicated.

So I don't know. Given all that, I guess, on average, this game is just fine.

RATING: 7
Agricola is an amazing game, no question.   While I recognize everything amazing about it, the cards make me not want to play. Card drafting is the only way to go to reduce randomness in the initial card draws, yet it adds 30 minutes to an already long game.  

Why do you need to reduce card randomness? Because some card combos are completely broken. Moreover, some cards are so broken that our group simply leaves them in the box.  To top it all off, the cards are subject to pages of errata and clarifications, e.g., "Does card A combo with card Z?". 

But the biggest issue is that knowledge of the cards and their relative power is absolutely necessary to do well.  Maybe I'm just bummed because my group keeps getting new card decks and I never had a chance to acclimate.

The ultimate multiplayer solitaire. Virtually no player interaction as any attempt to pick an action someone else needs is inevitably at your expense and to the advantage of the other players. Massive imbalances between starting positions based on the cards dealt. After multiple plays (~8+ now) this rating is dropping with each play. The theme also feels weaker and weaker with each play. A long way from a bad game but, inexplicably, massively over-rated here on the Geek.

A good game, but ultimately i find it super-stressful so i don't really want to play it anymore (gimme Caylus over this anyday)

We also found the family version has actually more depth to it than the regular one. It forces you to go for all aspects of the game, where the regular version, you stumble unto a pattern and play the same way every game... ignoring half the options the game presents you.

So, finally played the current #1 game. I can see why people tend to be euphoric about Agricola. Gameplay is a bit overwhelming at first, but smoothens out during your first play. Game mechanics are interesting, components top notch and the cards create a lot of variety. I expected a Puerto Rico-clone - to some extent it is, but Agricola is probably better.

But... Rich in theme my $ss. 
- animal populations tend to grow exponentionally if given enough space. Not in Agricola. 
- why can't I plow my fields, because some other farmer has done so this round?
- why can't I have children because my neighbour's wife is pregnant. And why does the kid need his own room?
- tell me how to make food out of wood, reed or clay? it would solve some of the major problems in the world.
- I can't slaughter a pig when I'm hungry, unless I have some improvement? Did prehistoric man need these improvements to eat a mammoth? No... 

But my biggest problem: no direct player interaction... Agricola would be so much more fun if you could burn down your neighbour's house, steal his cattle (or wife) or spoil his food supplies. Okay, maybe that's too violent. But how about trading cattle and other resources, renting out your ovens, fields or family members ('son, enough lingering around, go work at our neighbour's farm'). It would make the game so much more lively and exiting. 

The game is all about maximizing your cards and the options available. And that's it. Games are supposed to be social events. Exciting and lively. Agricola is not. It's a puzzle. A smart one, but puzzles can be solved alone. When people are around I want to interact with people. Agricola just isn't a social game.

Edit: I've given it a second change. My opinion hasn't changed much. Clever mechanics: Yes. Exiting: no. Interaction: very limited.

Bottom line: with 3-4 players and about 2 hours of playtime, I know lots of different deep games. Exiting games. Interactive games. Games that make more sense theme-wise.

Agricola is one of my favourite worker placement game. I especially enjoy seeing my farm grow slowly, piece by piece. In Agricola you have your own little farm that you build and nurture. Not only is building it great fun, but the game makes sure that there are plenty of tough choices every turn. It all comes together brilliantly as the players are trying to gather enough food to feed their little wooden families. Agricola is a surprisingly thematic game for a heavy euro. The game can take a while with more players and there is a certain tedium involved in the board upkeep that happens between rounds, but other than that Agricola is all-around a really good game.

Love the simple mechanics and the depth of the strategy. It can be a little difficult to convince someone to play a game where "you try to build the best damned farm around", but once you get over that hurdle, the gameplay is surprisingly easy to teach. Box lacks a decent sorting tray, and setting things up and clean-up is hampered as a result. I use lots of little plastic cups and bowls to store the pieces.

Some people in my group keep telling me this is a better game than I think it is. To me it is very fiddly in the setup.

RATING: 7
While Agricola is undeniably a classic from Uwe Rosenberg, I feel that Caverna is an improvement on it in almost all aspects that I care about. First the superficial: the art is more vibrant and pleasing to the eyes; the components are far superior with every resource and animal having uniquely shaped wooden pieces. In terms of game play, Caverna offers more choices and more freedom while removing the annoying food shortage in Agricola, so the game becomes more about building a thriving household than struggling to survive. To those who criticize Caverna for the lack of a random setup, I have to say that (1) the symmetric setup with no hidden information give the game more strategic depth and removes any luck factor (2) the huge number of rooms available ensures that the game never plays out the same way (3) one can always choose to draft rooms in the beginning rather than laying all of them out. In all, unless you are a stubborn, die-hard Agricola fan, you will find Caverna a deeper and more enjoyable game.

With Farmers of the Moor

Played base game 3x

Comes with a crazy amount of cards for tons of replayability. The cards are often very powerful and will aid your strategies in the game, although it can be intimidating since you get 14 cards at the beginning of the game and you probably don't want to use them all. 

Also the cards are unbalanced. The card draft variant adds more skill than random draw but not very beginner friendly.

As for playing the game itself... I like the "difficulty" of feeding your family and keeping your farm afloat. It makes each decision seem more important and blocking your opponents feels more dire. I also like how you will want to shoot for a well-rounded farm for the most part, but due to the swingy nature of the occupations and improvements, no two games are the same.

1-5 players, 90-120 minutes, medium heavy, farming/worker placement

I've played several games with 1-4 players, all of which were quite entertaining. The theme is nice, the components look nice and there is a lot to choose from (even with the family game). 

Once you've mastered the game mechanism and add the various crafts and investments (we haven't yet), the game becomes even more exciting. As there are several decks to choose from (beginner, advanced, expert), replayability is very high.

The solo game is quite good as well and even has a campaign where you need to improve your score every game. Definitely a keep in my collection.

Good solid game.  Plenty of options, resources in high demand, and plenty of variability with the large set of cards in the game.  This is one you should be able to play a lot.  For me it fixed the things I didn't like about Le Havre.  The components are good, and it has potential with people outside the board game hobby.  Very simple rules, with plenty to think about.  It did not grab me like my favorites do, but definitely worth a couple more plays to see how it holds up now that I am past the learning curve.

Really enjoy the theme and mechanics of this. A lot of people complain about the having to feed your workers aspect of the game, for me that's what actually makes the game. It adds a huge dose of push-your-luck to an otherwise very mechanics driven eurogame. Good components (although I swapped out my animeeples etc with the Goodies expansion), good quality all round, and a reasonable play length. Highly recommend.

Frustration in board-game form.

But is that necessarily bad?  I'm not quite sure.  

It is fun developing a farm, but having to feed your family so frequently can lead to a "one step forward, two steps back" feeling.

There is a puzzle element trying to figure out how to make everything work, and that's enjoyable.  But getting blocked from something you really, really need just plain sucks.  And this happens a lot.

It's certainly good and has some interesting features you don't often see in other games.  Most importantly is the fact that you need to do a little bit of everything to win; focusing too much on any single aspect is going to hurt you.

Good game though and the theme works extremely well.

I didn't like it at first, feeling that the cards were ultimately unbalancing, but it has become one of my favorites. In particular, playing with the iOS version has shown me just how good the game is.  It's very thematic, and during play you feel invested in the farm you are building and even the well-being of your family. Caverna is very similar, but robs the game of its intensity since you can always get what you need in Caverna.  Not so in Agricola! Going later in a turn can be devastating. I recommend playing with some sort of draft or dealing extra cards and discarding down to help eliminate the possible imbalance of the cards.

Traded my set, now have the revised edition--hoping that the new set balances the cards better.

The thing about Agricola is that you never feel like you had enough time to do everything you wanted, so you always want to play it again to try and hone your strategy. It's like a giant toy box and you're trying to get the toys you want out of it before someone else takes them. 

A lot of fun--but it also takes a long time to set up, a long time to play, and it's complicated to explain the rules to others.

What a hard and demanding challenge this game is!

Players might take quite a while to make any decision in this game because there are so many options and so much is demanded (otherwise, the final score will be severely affected if a series of requirements aren´t fullfilled), however, the game´s progression develops at high pace and, with very little resources, one finds very hard to accomplish all that was supposed to and priorities must be set.
The game mechanics can be somewhat heavy, especially for those who aren´t aquainted with similar games, and the experience can get somewhat stressing because, at the moment it feels like you are really acomplishing something, the game ends and the final score dictates it´s cruel law.
All in all, Agricola is very demanding about brain effort but is an experience and a challenge few gamers dislike.

Includes 3rd party animeeples. Still my favorite game, Ill admit partly due to nostalgia since this was our first *real* weighty euro. I love the decision space Agricola provides as well as tactile feel of building the "farm". I have played this so many times that the "feeding" phase no longer feels like a burden unless I'm trying some wacky tactic. Most people I have taught this to do not like it and I believe that is because it takes at least 3-4 plays to get a handle on the strategy. It is a great game and will forever be at the top of my best list.

I really like Agricola, the cards make this game really interesting and unique.  Drafting the cards is absolutely essential though, otherwise the element of luck is too high.  

Game is excellent with two and three players, but I feel that the family growth action becomes too essential once you reach four players.  If you're the last person to take family growth (and someone has to be the last person every game) you're at a severe disadvantage, that makes the first few turns of the game feel like it's all about planning to be the first to take family growth.

It's possible that expert players can take advantage of this and pursue a strategy that doesn't rely as heavily on family growth, but it has seemed too important with my limited experience with the game.

RATING: 10
Rating after ca. 35 games, probably 20 with Moorbauern expansion which improves the game (otherwise I might want to remove 0.5 rating).
To make it challenging we always use (secret) card drafts, otherwise it would be too random for the tastes of people I play with (otherwise I might want to remove 0.5-1 rating).
Very high replay value even without expansions due to 3 alternative card sets.
I own lots of other extensions which are mostly fine for variety but admittedly I played only ca. 5 out of 10 so far :-P

RATING: 7
Agricola just didn't scratch me the right way. I was bored during the 2nd play and didn't see this getting any better. It was just too dry for me. Yes, there is high replayability through the cards and yes, they do change up strategies to some degree. But, it just didn't do it for me.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Having tried it again a couple of years later, it is more enjoyable than I thought. My gaming tastes have also changed over the last couple of years. I still don't view it as the best game, for myself, but I can appreciate the strategy more.

I could never get on with this. It always seemed to be the case that one is penalised for what one doesn't do and never much rewarded for what one does do. A huge sprawling game with lots of opportunities and choices but since you cannot do everything why is it so negative?

RATING: 9
I wasn't sure about this game the first time I played. But a few more kicks at the can and I was hooked. Every attempt offers something different; a new twist on a strategy, a whole new approach, and it's very family friendly.

It does, however, take a while to play, especially with newcomers. One game for 4 players clocked in at 5 hours.

I do agree with some people's assessment that there's limited player interaction, but that (in part) depends on the deck of cards you're using and what you consider interaction. Some inter-farm trading might spice things up, but as is, it's a wonderful setup and well thought out.

Update: after finally playing Puerto Rico (and liking it very much) I've decided to level the playing field and give both these games a well-deserved 9. I'm taking Agricola down a step for lack of inter-play between gamers (which Puerto Rico offers more off), but Agricola has a much longer strategic path. 

Both are great.

Update 2: No, Agricola rocks so much I put it back up to 10. There's something very special about a game I keep coming back to even though I've rarely won. I love building a working farm. Seems boring; it's not.

Update 3: We picked up farmers of the moor and the G-Deck; the game becomes much more rounded. I lowered the score because the game is so long and heavy that few are interested. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
No, no, no, no and no again. As much as I love Caverna, I trully, passionately I hate Agricola. Feeding my people is not my main concern, it's the fact that I have to do everything in order not to lose points. If I want to specilize in carrots, let me do it. Uwe Rosenberg is a smart designer, realized it and made a better game.

RATING: 9
The most hyped game of the season.

Yes, it is very, very good. My caveat is we played with 5 players, all of whom were new, plus we had paste-ups. So, we had a lot of downtime. I definitely want to play this again, but only with experienced players or 2-3 players.

I am going to buy this (well, preorder it from Z-man), I think it will have excellent replayability and that Jason and I can play it 2p in an hour so it would make the regular game rotation cycle. I'd rate it an 8 on the first play but I suspect it will go up to a 9 once we cut the down-time issue and speed it up a bit.
--
Played a 2nd game with 5, only one noob, the downtime wasn't bad.  I upped my rating to a 9. It may go up further.  I was able to see neat card combos in my hand this time and this dictated my strategy nicely.  I can't wait to get my copy (on preorder with Zev)

5-4-10 Extremely well rounded game, great mechanics and balance with lots of variation for dozens of unique plays.  This is my dads favorite game because of the endless choices.

5-19-11 edit:Haven't played this one in over a year.  When this itch comes up, it is Le Havre.  Downgraded to a 7 from 8.

5-11-15 Played again for the first time in 5+ years, I forgot how great this game plays.  Planning more games soon, purchased a few more expansions too - including Farmers of the Moor which I read really makes the game excellent.

Full of interesting choices, keeps fresh thanks to the cards. More "entertaining" (less serious) than Caylus. Some averaging mechanism is needed (such as classic or rochester draft) for competitive play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
    - Important note: this review is based on 12 2-player and 3 3-player games; I've never played with more yet.
    
    - Gameplay: 4/4. Agricola is a fun game to play, similar to Caylus. It is highly competitive and there is a lot of player interaction. You'll need a good strategy to win, but still be flexible enough to adapt to the circumstances. Thanks to the occupation and minor improvement cards it really feels like the game is different with each play, as the viability of certain strategies depend on them, really allowing multiple paths to victory. Because of the engine building aspect combined with the strong theme, you really feel like a farmer struggling for survival. At the end of the game you feel you have achieved something and it is hard to resist the urge to examine and discuss why your family members were/weren't able to build a prosperous farm. One downside is that just like Caylus, Agricola lets you build an engine for which you don't get enough turns to really reap its benefits. I have read that Le Havre fixes this issue.

    - Absence of luck: 3/4. Although there is luck in the draw of the occupation and minor improvement cards, I have the impression that they level out nicely (partly depending on the deck you use). Even when are dealt a stellar hand, you still need the ability to use them well. Also, by focussing on the strategy supported by your cards, you give way for your opponents to follow their strategy. To avoid the few cases where you really feel like your cards are absolutely worthless, there are a few good variants provided to mitigate this last source of bad luck. As I feel it, there is much more randomness caused by the other players' actions than by the dealing of the cards. This second kind of luck factor doesn't bother me at all, because it makes the game even more fun by trying to guess what actions the other players need to do an trying to block them.

    - Duration: 3/4. Agricola takes a bit more than an hour with 2 players and a bit more than 1.5h with 3 players. Compared with the games I know this is quite short. It is rare to find a short game that is both this thematic and this strategic. It considerably lowers the threshold of bringing the game on the table. 
    
    - Player range: 4/4. Note that I've only played with 2 and 3 players. The game is really nice with both player numbers. The downtime increases with the player count, but with 3 there is still not much downtime. What is especially nice is that you'll need a different strategy for different numbers of players (and this without rule modifications!), adding even more variation to the game.

    - Theme and looks: 4/4. If there is one aspect where Agricola really shines it is in the theme. I doubt a game theme can get stronger than this. The artwork and components are nice also. Make sure you get a version that includes animeeples and maybe vegimeeples and resource meeples. I'm always surprised how big the difference is between placing a cube on the board or a sheep meeple. It really increases the game's fun factor. 

    - Set up/clean up time: 2/4. Agricola takes some 10 minutes to set up and some 10 minutes for cleanup. This is long, but it still feels considerably less hassle than setting up Puerto Rico. Considering the length of the game I can live with it.

    - Learning curve and documentation: 2/4. You simply cannot explain all relevant rules to a newcomer at once. He'll need at least one full game to grasp even the basics. Thankfully, the in-game documentation is great and the strong theme makes the rules easy to remember. So I don't consider Agricola hard to learn, but it does take a few games before you can actually start playing it.
    
    - Other notable aspects: one think that is worth mentioning is that this game requires quite some table space.    
    
    - Like: unbeatable theme, relatively short, highly competitive, lots of player interaction, lots of variation, also great with 2 players
    
    - Dislike: too few turns to benefit from the engine you've built

I really don't have anything bad to say.  Five player sometimes you feel screwed out of being able to realize any long-term strategy.  Sometimes the card draws also seem to just not help you at all and help others tons.  Overall though the game is still fun regardless of the above.

The fact that most games I can exactly spend all my resources on turn 14 with no waste shows me that long term planning DOES work.

RATING: 6
With a dozen plays in 2 weeks, Agricola has clearly captivated me with its replayability.  The basic game is OK, but it's the cards that really kick this up to a must play.  The cards force you to try new lines of strategy.  There's no resting on your laurels here.

That said, the farming theme isn't terribly exciting to me.  Also, while the theme isn't as tacked on as it is in most Euros it isn't exactly dripping with theme either.  This game could be re-themed without much trouble.  It reminds me a bit of Puerto Rico: the mechanics work with the theme, but they could easily have supported other themes w/o changing any rules.  What would make Agricola a 10 in my book is if it were re-themed as a war profiteer game where players compete to become the best arms dealer.

On second thought, maybe this game will make it to 10 anyway.  Only time, more plays, and cracking into the other decks some more will tell.

Update: I'm already feeling some resistance from my group on this one.  If this trend continues, I won't get a chance to fully explore this wonderful game.

Update: Now I'm the one who's feeling resistant.  I really like Ag, but my passion has moved on to other games.  It is now a solid game in my collection, rather than a must play.  As I predicted, I prefer Puerto Rico at the end of the day.

Update: I've officially burned out on Ag.  Too many 2 hour plus games of it have killed it for me.  I just can't help squirming in my seat as my opponents agonize over the simplest of choices.  I've stopped even trying to win...I just don't care anymore.  

Post Script: totally Jones-Theoried by Caverna.

This is a decent variant of the resource management/competition game that so many Euro's follow. Unlike some folks, I actually enjoy trying to figure out the best uses of my Occupation and Improvement cards.

Complaints about playing time have reached absurd new levels with regards to this game. If you can't handle 30-40 minutes per player, it's time for you to find a new hobby.

Complaints about lack of interaction strike me as bizarre. First, it's just not what the game is designed to be. BGG is riddled with resource management games that aren't interactive, e.g. Puerto Rico, so I'm not sure why people are targeting this game for that particular criticism. Second, there's an interactive deck, if you prefer a more interactive game.

My _own_ complaint is that not all Occupations and Improvements are created equal, and the right combination can give players an incredible advantage in the long run, even if it doesn't seem obvious to the other players at first.

Still, I think this game is relatively fun, and will probably be good for about a dozen plays.

Update: I'm now convinced that your initial hand of Occupations and Improvements is too crucial. Also, the theme just isn't interesting.

For me there are a lot positives and negatives that stand out about this game that make it really difficult to rate.

Positives:
* Great theme worked in very well
* Lots of strategic decisions and paths to take

Negatives
* New Player's have no chance at all with lots of brainburn
* Long for what it is
* Felt heavy and really dull, game only gets interesting towards the end when you have three workers to place.
* A couple of bad decisions early on and you will be behind for the rest of the game.

The only downside to this game is a somewhat steep learning curve. It's one of those games that if you don't play for a while, it takes a couple practice rounds to remember the flow of the game. There are a lot of strategies that can succeed in this game, which keeps this game towards the front of our gaming shelf. One complaint is the difficulty you can have feeding your family. Not having enough food is almost a game-ender.

This is truly one of the best gamer's games that I own and I predict that it will still be popular years from now; a modern classic. Great decision-making, great replay value, great design; a must-own title.

It scales well, both in difficulty and in player count (including single-player!). Each game is very different, thanks to the inclusion of [gameid=463]-like card combos which provide nearly unlimited paths to victory. The gameplay suits the theme, as in games like [gameid=2651] and [gameid=30869]. It has the gameplay depth of games like [gameid=13122] and [gameid=875], but it's more accessible. I think this game is perfect for gamers that love [gameid=3076], and have played it death, but want some added variety (although the it isn't limited to just that audience, by any means). It's beautifully produced and it's loaded with 300+ cards (the animeeples are a must).

If you are worried about hype, get over it. If you are worried about complexity, play the family variant first. If you are worried about random factors, play the official card-draft variant. If you are worried about the monetary cost, sell your child on eBay. Just get this game!

Its good, I enjoy playing it, but its not the Messiah. The core game flows well enough and its a good combination of limited action selection ("I want to do 20 things but I can only do 3?") and "tile" laying.
The extras though are what really make the game worth replaying. Discovering new combinations and working out how to get them into play are what really hold the interest for me. Although there's always that hump to get over at the start as each player reads through what they have and ponder what to use.

The bloom has faded a bit on this rose, although I still love to play. Almost all the members of my playing group dislike the cards, which have caused much whining and have lengthened the games considerably. I'm not a big fan of using cards to generate replayability either, but Agricola does a better job of that than most other such games. Fortunately, by varying the number of players, we'll be able to enjoy dozens of deckless plays of this fine game before we figure out the script.

Personally I enjoy the game.  It got ousted from our regular game rotation though because some of our regular members didn't like the time crunch aspect of the game.

That said, Agricola served well as a 2 player game for me and my brother, also a very heavy gamer, during our last annual family reunion.  We logged 5 or 6 plays and I enjoyed them all.

I really wish I got this game to the table more often, as I really can see the charm of the game, but haven't played enough to give a solid rating on it.

A tense game. The numerous cards ensure endless variations. The kids seem to enjoy it.

The only shortcoming is that the game rarely seems to have a solid conclusion: it seems to end just a round or two early, just when you have some card interaction coming into play.

Bought in November 2007, played one single player game. Can not say too much about the game yet.

It took me quite some time to come up with a rating for Agricola. Sadly, this fine worker placement game doesn't hit the table as often as I'd like. I guess, one of the reasons that it doesn't do so is also the reason why I like this game so much: Agricola is tense! While playing Agricola, I'm constantly stressed. How can I feed my family? How do I upgrade my farm so that I won't come in last place again? How can I combine these two things? Agricola rewards me for all this stress like no other game: In the end, there is the farm that I've built, giving me this great feeling of accomplishment. But I get that the stress level in this game is not everyone's cup of tea.

Furthermore, Agricola implements the farming theme very well. I never had any problems explaining this game to new players since every action just makes sense. Sure, you'll have to remember the exact number of grains to put on a grain after planting it, but the gameplay itself is surprisingly intuitive for such a 
heavy game.

Still one of my favorites, especially after a lot of practice with the app. I find the art adorable, the variability high, and the choices always just hard enough. I don't get to play often enough on the table, but I don't envision this leaving my collection any time soon.

I really have no idea what to say about this game. For people who play video games I love Harvest Moon. I figured this game would be perfect. However it leaves me a little unfufilled. It might be that in the games I have played the cards I get seem to work againest eachother so much I might play one or two, that help me very little while friends would play amazing combos that just leave me feeling like the game is againest me. I still don't mind playing the game, I just wonder if there is any kind of drafting rule that should be put into effect, or even giving each player four more then normal and discard down.

Love the theme: you're a farmer trying to feed your family and you struggle to survive. 

This game is STRESSFUL. I understand some might be turned off from that but I enjoy the tension. 

The game is largely skill driven and requires diversification instead of "pick X strategy out of 5 and hope you get enough points in the end" 

I've never played Caverna but I hear it's a good alternative. I'm sticking to what I already have and love.

I do not like this game because I believe it is disingenuous.  Unless you are a real expert in Latin, you might buy this game thinking that it is feminine, but then when you play it you will realize that it is masculine.  By then, it will probably be too late to return it.

I have the same complaint about these other games: Poeta, Nauta, Insula.  Those games should be called Male Poet, Male Sailor, and Male Island (although maybe Manly Island makes more sense).

It took my 23rd play of this game to finally realize the design isn't right for everyone. My friend who has only played once or twice, built a beautiful farm which was relatively full but ultimately lost because I had more family members. Not that you should play this game for theme, but when there is a slight thematic disconnect in regards to winning the game, players can feel cheated. Still an amazing design of trying to be as efficient with your cards and actions as possible.

RATING: 7
Going back and re-rating this one after some recent plays. I've knocked it down quite a bit. It's a good game with an interesting theme and lots of variety through the many cards and decks. But what gives me pause is the intense competition for action spaces. The game can be extremely frustrating and tough to execute a strategy because resources are so tight. An admirable design, but I prefer games with a bit more openness. It almost feels like Rosenberg reached the same conclusion as his later worker placement designs are far more open and forgiving.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game starts with reading 18 cards and goes downhill from there. Draw all endgame cards while your opponents play cards that give them resources throughout? You lose. And you knew it from turn 1. Fascinating. Nudge me when it's over...

edit: Played the revised edition. The reduced card pool seems to have addressed the problems of the opening hand. No doubt it's better than the draft solution - which was a non-starter for new players. Rating upped to 6 accordingly.

However, in LeHavre, a small set of initial possibilities expands every turn. In Agricola a vast set of initial possibilities is narrowed every turn. My strong preference is for the former.

A very strong worker placement game. My wife likes it a lot more than I do. I enjoy it, but I find experienced players have too much of an advantage since the game is so brutal, and newer players usually don't make enough use of their occupation and minor improvement cards. The number of components hurts my enjoyment too. On the plus side it's very easy to teach, and I have always enjoyed my time with it.

I was a little skeptical of the theme at first - I mean, you're just building a farm! - but I've come to love the tension in this game. Harvests come faster and faster, ramping up the worry about whether you have enough food.

Fun, interesting. And before anyone bothers to give me shit about not rating this a 10, I'm mostly a hex-n-chit wargamer. Until some develops an expansion that gives bread baking a 2-column shift modifier, provides decent cover rules for the different sort of building materials, and develops proper ZOC rules for sheep, this game will sit quite comfortably at just shy of a 7 or so. I'll still take a game of CC:E, Espana 1936, ATS, or ASL over this every time.

After having played this once, I don't really understand how this game got to number one on BGG.  It's not a bad game, but there's just too many decisions to keep track of - kind of like Age of Empires 3.  I'm not stupid by a long shot, but I don't like my games to be that complicated. I'm a simple man at heart, and simple things make me happy.
I won't ever turn down playing this game, but I will definitely not ever suggest playing this again.

The hype machine is in the overdrive again.  This is an alright game if you like card driven games.  Which I don't, because card driven games are by default inelegant with all the constraints and rules on the various cards.  It is also very, very fiddly with all the bits and pieces; it would be a much better game if it were a computer game - a sort of Sim Farm, if you want.  It strives to be a simulation, but it doesn't really succeed. An OK(-ish) game.

RATING: 6
This was very enjoyable to play.  Even so, there are too many exceptions and there are too many things going on for my tastes.  I would NEVER try to get my fiancee to play (or even my business partner) to play this game.  I played the first game without looking at the cards in my hand.  This was a great move on my part because it took the whole game just to figure out what was going on in regards to the options on the board.  Things started to become clear half way through the game.  

I decided to play it again immediately afterwards (which is a good sign) and everything made more sense. This time, I used many of the cards in my hand and consequently did a lot better (well, I won by a HUGE margin, but that was because most of the players were new and they did not value wood even though I told them it was really important).  Even so, there were several areas of confusion that no one could answer authoritatively, which is VERY annoying when it causes a conflict (which it almost did).  

So while the game does not seem very tight, there is something about it that is very enjoyable to play.  And with all of the variation from the cards, I'm sure that I will end up playing quite a few more times.

--- Edit ---
I think I only ended up playing it one more time.  I guess its not my cup of tea.

The game that started this whole boardgame craze of mine.
In less than 2 years I have acquired more than a hundred games for my bulging shelves, all because of Agricola.
I had heard about it on a strategy computer gaming podcast, and me and my gf decided to buy it instead of the newest incarnation of Trivial Pursuit, when we were browsing for some game we could play for an upcoming couples night.
And I loved it.
Fortunately, she loved it too, which is why she tolerates the metric ton of cardboard in our living room.

It's stay at the top of BGG for an extended time and the constant battle of Puerto rico and Agricola ultimately pushed me to buy this and I did not regret it.  I have owned it for about 3 weeks and played it solo about 10 times and with friends about 7 times.  This game is great, lots of stuff to do and the screw your neighbor aspect of making decisions is quite exceptional.  If I see this game requested at the game table I will definitely consider picking up an expansion

Great game for young and old. I Have only played with the basic E decks. Played the heck out of this for a while and kinda burnt out on it. Looking forward to a little more time to go by and wearing this out again.

Update: Started playing again and brought out the "I" deck and conducting a card draft. Really cool! Drafted cards around the day before so everyone was ready to play the next day, each with a strategy that didn't work as well as anyone hoped. This early draft really let everyone evaluate the cards without the pressure of getting the game started.

Tentative rating after one play. Not totally impressed so far. It's a good game and it will never play out the same way twice which is great for replayability, but I still didn't get totally excited about it. I do think it will grow on you, so rating might well increase in the future when I get to play it more.

Best (and only score) so far: 48p in a four player game. 

Update: Played a 5-player game today, and while still fun the game became a bit too long to be really enjoyable. I'm usually not too fond of optimization games as it is. I'll still gladly play it but preferably with four or fewer players. Interesting to note that the cards change according to number of players. Nice!

A convoluted mess of a game.  It takes numerous plays to understand all the cards and how they work together.

Just the perfect implementation of classic euro game staples.  The fact that your hand of cards can give you a different experience each game, and the fact that there are so many scoring tracks that the whole table isn't going to the same place just makes it so much fun.  Having the divergent goals actually increases the antagonism instead of decreasing it, oddly enough.  I can look around and see that nobody is set to go for a stone house yet, but somebody just took a bunch of wood.  Well, I was going to build a fence next turn, but I'll take the space now since I can wait on the house improvement.  Love it.

I think it is safe to believe the hype on this game.  An excellent worker placement game similar to Caylus.  Agricola however includes hundreds of cards that can make each game quite a bit different from a strategic point of view.  Out of the 100s of cards included in the game, you get 14 at the start to make up your hand.  These are played to enhance a particular strategy you have chosen.

I'm not sure whether the cards sacrifice balance for variability.  So I'm starting it out at a 9, but could see it going up to 10 if future playings show this not to be a problem.

After many plays, this game has indeed gone up to a 10.  It has rapidly become one of my favorite games.  Just an overall excellen design.  Great mesh of strategy and theme for a euro.

Update:  9 years since i wrote the above.  Nothing has changed.  This game is simply amazing.  My favorite euro.

At the beginning of time, simple hunters and gatherers spread from their homelands looking for resources. In the neighboring areas are numerous other tribes who are competing for the same, limited resources. As time goes, on the tribes get larger, building bigger towns, developing new technologies, and eventually domesticating animals or planting crops in sufficient numbers that the tribe is able to sustain itself, and is able to focus its attention on building a great city, and monuments to its power. In the end the largest tribe, with the greatest monuments, and the widest variety of nutritional sources, in other words the tribe best positioned for the future will win.

Agricola is, in other words, a civilization game and a damn good one at that. With immense amount of variety, and an engaging theme. The tension in establishing the greatest civilization/farm is fun, and I think that thinking of it as a civilization game even makes the end game scoring more intuitive. The score represents a sum of both the civilization/farm's current progress as well as its future opportunities with its technologies (improvements), specialized workers (occupations), its nutritional sources (crops and livestock), its ability to sustain itself (fields and pastures), and its overall population (family members). 

When I first got onto BoardGameGeek and began to hear about Agricola, my initial response was disdain. My reaction against the hype surrounding it was so strong, that I became dismissive about the potential quality of the game. As time went on, however, my suspicion began to shift towards enthusiasm, and I eventually caved and pre-ordered the game. After my pre-order the enthusiasm grew to epic levels, and when Agricola finally arrived I was in no, way, or shape disappointed. 

When I brought the game with me to Gen Con most everyone I taught it to shared my enthusiasm. Five different people I taught the game to, bought it at the convention for $70, and I played the game seventeen times there. 

I could go into great detail about why I love Agricola, but this game is so omnipresent on BoardGameGeek that there is no point. I will state that I think this is the ultimate resource management game, and may be the best civilization game out there. I have not yet played the classic Civilization, so I am not yet sure.

Players represent medieval farmers, working their own 15 spaces of land.  The game is played over 14 turns, interrupted every now and again by harvest time.  The beginning of each turn sees areas of the boards seeded with stuff to make them increasingly attractive (wood, clay, animals, etc).  Players then take actions with their farmers (start with two, but can increase to five) to do stuff - build, renovate, plough, reap, breed, bake, etc.  It's all about growth and expansion, with the ultimate goal to have your 15 spaces brimming with food and animals.  Nicely executed game, great theme.  A couple of astonishing things - the innocuous looking box is jam packed full of stuff - wood, boards, playing cards.  In addition, the game comes with hundreds of cards, roughly divided into "jobs" and "items" that grant players additional abilities if they can get them into play.  This turns a rather dry game into something you can play for years and still discover things you hadn't seen before.  The designer, developer, artist and playtesters must have gone bonkers balancing all this out into a nice, playable game.  Another plus is the game feels very different, based on the number of players, from solitaire up to five.  Two years and about 50 games later, the rating has settled on a 6 - okay, but have to be in the mood.  Too much anguish to be fun.

I've always done well when playing this, but it might be the most frustrating game I've ever played.  I constantly feel like I have no good decisions, too many decisions to make, and too few resources to play with.  It seems more agonizing than anything else, though I think I enjoy it afterwards.

I need to play with the cards more and try and figure out a good way to manage those.  I also think I need to play with some experienced players to get the real feel of the game down.

The fact that all of the replayability comes from the cards dealt bothers me - I almost feel like I have to play a small game of Magic on the side in order to do well in Agricola, and in Agricola itself it's obvious what I should be proceeding toward.  This may because I've only played 2 player.  In all of my games both players have been able to accomplish very good layouts.  Maybe with more players there'd be more sacrifice.  Or maybe we need to play more aggressively.

Ultimately I still feel like the real challenge is in making the best use of your cards, and that doesn't seem right.  It's not a card game.

I do like the race for the exclusive action spaces you need and the press your luck element (surprisingly).  And I'm still very happy to get the game to the table.

I definately see the attraction to this game, but I don't think this deserves the widespread gushing it receives. 

This game uses the same "limited menu" of choices that Peuerto Rico pioneered and Wallace games have been using ever since. However, this game features a wide wide menu of actions, such that there is less cut-throat positioning and ruthless grabbing away from your opponents. If something you sought is gone, odds are you can do something else productive. In fact it seems that seeking the path of least resistance is a key strategy. 

A bit convoluted the first time through, I expect a second playing will be much faster and coherent.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Aparte de ser un clásico de la colocación de trabajadores, el Agrícola es uno de los juegos más "redondos" que he tenido la suerte de probar: es de estos que cuanto más lo juegas más te vas dando cuenta de lo bien pensado que está, y aun sin ser el mejor juego de la historia gustará a casi todo el mundo.

Además, hay un par de "mitos" con respecto a este juego que me gustaría desmentir:

 -> Agrícola NO es un juego extremadamente difícil. Su versión familiar resulta bastante fácil de entender, sobre todo si (¡regla casera!) la primera vez que juegas no utilizas todas las adquisiciones mayores (recomiendo usar solo la Alfarería, la Cestería y la Ebanistería, pues son muy sencillas de explicar). Puede que no sea adecuado para iniciar en el mundo de los juegos de mesa a alguien que nunca ha probado uno, pero tampoco le falta mucho (en cuanto haya probado 2 ó 3 juegos de iniciación, ya podrás sacarle el Agrícola).

 -> Agrícola SÍ que tiene interacción entre los jugadores. Aunque es un poco difícil de percibir en la primera partida, según vayas cogiéndole el truco te darás cuenta de que ocupar ciertas acciones claves en determinados momentos del juego puede hacer que otro jugador se quede sin posibilidades de ganar... o al menos ponérselo francamente difícil.

Aparte de lo ya mencionado, hay que decir que es uno de los juegos que mejor escalan a cualquier número de jugadores: aunque resulte difícil de creer, puede resultar igual de entretenido a 2 que a 4 jugadores (aunque la experiencia de juego sea distinta... a más jugadores, más choques habrá entre ellos).

Como único punto negativo me gustaría mencionar sus ilustraciones. Los colores están bien elegidos, pero es que el estilo de los dibujos se me hace demasiado infantil para un juego tan profundo, y la verdad es que puede echar para atrás a más de uno (una pena, porque merece mucho la pena).

Fabulous game.  Growing on me, especially now that I've played a handful of games on www.boiteajeux.net, which give you time to think through the strategic options a little!

I think I will never like this game as more than a good friend.  Despite the card decks, this game is Euro like Tom Willis is white (which means very very, not matter what crazy cards are mixed in or who he's married to).  It does do a good job of evoking the appropriate angst of being a 17th century farmer, but actions are just so limited it feels like trying to swim in handcuffs.  On one level I enjoy it, and on another I find it laborious.  I think I'll play this one every once in a while, but I doubt it will become a favorite.  After my latest game, my overriding thought was that I think that, for a heavy worker placement game, I prefer Caylus.

UPDATE: My love/hate relationship with this game continues.  I still am not very good at it, but am enjoying it more.  My problem is that I get distracted from my goals too easily, and there just aren't enough spare actions to do that.

RATING: 7
Although being a peasant and farmer (is there a difference in the English language?) isn't too exciting to me, this game has certainly something to it. The process of building your farm and amassing all those beautiful wooden vegetables and cute wooden animals seems to resonate in my brainstem. The cards add the urgently needed amount of variety to the game - without them it would be quite repetitive after a few games. I also like the mechanism, that resources start to accumulate on one action field, and form a nice little pile of wood, until one finally shows mercy and takes it all.
One thing I dislike, however, is the fact that this game is so tense. I mean, it's too tense. There are always not enough rounds left, not enough resources to achieve what you desire. The whole tension is just a little over the top, for me personally. Also, the hunger mechanism is turning me off.

Agricola is lots of fun.  There is always a strong contest for the actions and resources, and with different numbers of players, that contest shifts.  I also really enjoy the theme, it really feels like you are growing a farming family.  One sign of how good this game is, is that I'm not that good at it, but still really enjoy it.  I always seem to get caught up chasing some complex string of occupations and improvements that would have won me the game had I only been able to (insert card/action/resource here).  Seems to happen every time, but I always come back to chase another impossible string of cards.  One of these days I'll wise up and play more conservative. :-)

I love this game and would dearly love to get in more plays of it.  Brilliant worker placement game with a ton of options.  The ridiculous number of cards keeps things fresh and you can still always go back to the family game for a really tight and close alternative.  It's also surprisingly fast once you've got the hang of it, we often manage to play in about 15 to 20 mins per player these days.

Super fun! Reminds me of SimCity. There are so many options and avenues to take to improve and supply your family unit, that it can be a bit overwhleming at first, but after reading through the (terrible) rulebook and playing through it a couple of times, the fun value really starts to kick in.

I've had about 60 plays now, mostly with 2, but also with 3 and 4, and I'm still very impressed by this game.  I've used all 3 of the E, I and K decks, and find them all interesting and fun to play with, although admit a slight preference of E/K to I, probably for the sole reason that most of my "I" games were only with 2 people, so the "interaktion" aspect was somewhat limited.

An additional note: I highly recommend that when introducing this game to new players, play with no more than 4 and start with the family game.

Great game with a lot of depth and decisions to make.  Tons of replayability and not too difficult to get your head around the core rules.  Only issue is you need to understand all the cards otherwise you get hammered so it's a game you have to invest time in.  Didn't really get my strategy right but it was my first game.  Overall it deserves it's high rating on BGG.

Admittedly, Agricola took several plays to even begin to see how great it is, but it has become my favorite game.  It is just so.... so.....

I have played this a lot, and I like the "Family Game" very much. You basically play without the Occupation and Improvement cards which makes for a less random and more chess like game.

I like the full game as well, but the cards are obviously of varying usefulness and a large part of being good at the game revolves around knowledge about what cards are good and in which combinations. There's nothing wrong with that, and it certainly adds replayability, but it also adds an element of luck.

I came.
I saw.
I ate some sheep.
I love the way that the action pool progressively rolls out and the many fun and sometimes difficult choices it presents.   The scoring system is a bit odd, and makes it hard to tell who is winning.  But the game looks great, the animeeples are a real nice touch, and the occupation and minor improvement cards should give a massive amount of replayability.  The game doesn't take itself seriously and the sense of humor really comes through. Best of the worker placement games that I have played, despite not really innovating in any way.   It somehow just works.

RATING: 8
Rating based on a single, four-player game. The game seemed to start slow and then slowly cascaded. The random Minor Improvements and Occupation cards had really good combos for some players, not so much for others. How much does that affect the outcome? I don't know yet. No one got anything going until well past mid-game and then before we knew it, the game was over. I'm not sure if this "snowball" effect seen in so many of the highly ranked Eurogames is a plus or not for Agricola. I don't seem to mind it in (for example) Puerto Rico, but that may be because each player in PR gets the same number of moves and the same opportunities to perform an action. In Agricola, this isn't necessarily the case.

UPDATE: Ratings upgrade (7 -> 8). Another 4-player game. Very close ending (tied, actually). While it does appear that random occupation/improvement cards may help some players over others, part of the replayability of the game is dependent on this randomness. Want to play more.

Gazdálkodj okosan :D. Mielőtt bármit is írnék a játékról el kell mondjam, hogy nem szeretem azokat a játékokat, ahol valamilyen negatív hatás ellen kell küzdeni. Jelen esetben, minden betakarításkor meg kell etetni a jómunkás embereket, különben keményen megbüntet a játék. Régebben már játszottam a játék családi változatával, hát nem lett a kedvenc játékom. Túl hosszú, a szabálymagyarázat is, ki- és bepakolás, mindig valaki elveszi azt a lépést, amit épp kinéztél.... Most kipróbáltuk négyen, kissé gondolkodós társaság vagyunk, simán eltartott 3 órát a játék. Arra gondoltam, hogy most ne a családi változattal játszunk, hátha a kártyák némi izgalmat adnak a játéknak. Azért nem az összes lapot vetettük be, csak az egyszerűbbeket. Most már értem, miért fanyalognak sokan azon, hogy a kártyák szerencsét visznek a játékba. A sógorom a kapott lapjaival behozhatatlan előnyre tett szert. A halászatból simán megvolt a betevője. Ráadásul, mivel a halászat alapban csak egy ételt ad, így senki nem pazarolta el a szűkös és ezért rendkívül értékes akcióját arra, hogy blokkolja. Persze neki volt olyan kártyája, amivel tudott mindannyiunkat blokkolni kétszer is, méghozzá úgy, hogy a 2 létszám fölötti családtagok akcióit blokkolta, fájdalmas volt :). Tehát úgy gondolom a családi változat letisztultabb, de a kártyák több színt visznek a játékba. Ettől még nem ez lesz a kedvenc játékom :). (2015.08.19.)

My wife and I love the game play of Agricola, but at the end of the game it always feels like the work is unfinished. That's true of farming, so it adds realism to the game! The various decks provide good variety, and several possible strategies increase the replay value. It does seem like a lot to set up, and the length of a game makes it rare that we can play more than once in an evening. Our boys don't like it as much, so we need to find other players! Update: focusing on the end-game sooner helps me like this game even more.

I struggle with how to rate this one. While it is an excellent game, it didn't live up to the hype for me. The AP (due to all of the cards) and lack of player interaction are its biggest weaknesses. I was expecting to be so stunned by the game that I would immediately want to play again, but one game was enough. I look forward to more plays, but I didn't get that pleasureable reaction that I got after my first plays of my other favorites.

RATING: 7
The original “farming game” of 2007 spewed forth a slew of similar games; it was a great game for its time but has now been completely superseded by its superior sequel “Caverna.”  

I played this a few times and then played Caverna a few times.  I immediately felt Caverna to be much more balanced and streamlined.  I recently played the original Agricola again and that play-through really hammered in my feelings toward the original game.  I strongly dislike the Occupation and Minor Improvement Cards handed out at the beginning of the game as I find them random and unbalanced; they also strongly favor experienced players.  I didn’t even focus on them and just ignored them.   

The best parts of Agricola (the resource management, the seeding and growing of your family, farm and livestock) are all in Caverna (along with enjoyable new options such as adventuring and mining).  However, in Caverna everyone equally has access to the same options and ALL options are there on the table for everyone to see and players don’t have to worry about random and unpredictable factors showing up via Occupation and Minor Improvement Cards.  

While Caverna is more accommodating toward new players while at the same time keeping experienced gamers engaged, Agricola players really can only be challenged in a game if they are playing against other seasoned-players as was evidenced by the wide-range of scores resulting from our recent game: the player who brought and promoted the game scored 44 points, the two middle-players that had some experience (myself included) scored 25 and 23 points, and the new player scored negative-two (-2) points (and he is an experienced gamer too!).  I would not call Agricola a broken game by any means, but by 2016 standards, its not quite up to speed with Caverna out there running around.  

I’ve read that some players promoting Agricola will add new expansion cards and cull certain other ‘broken’ cards, etc… why bother when you can just pull out Caverna and play it out-of-the-box as is.  

I guess back in 2007, I would have given this game a “8”, but now in 2016 I would give it a “6”; so I’ll compromise and give it a mellow “7”.

I have officially taken this off my wishlist. The random elements of the copious cards, mixed with the annoying tedium of the setup, mixed with the fiddly constant replenishment of resources on the board, mixed with it's utter lack of player interaction, mixed with the fact that it takes forever to play... have led me to the conclusion that this game is not for me.

The first Euro style, worker placement game I ever played.  To be honest, this game confused the crap out of me at first.  My friend and I actually watched a Youtube video to figure out how to play.  The sad part is...the game is incredibly simple!  I will admit, it's frustrating trying to move through the different phases, especially when you don't have enough food to feed your workers.  I've heard that Caverna is better than Agricola all around, but I haven't played it yet.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So, is farming in the middle ages fun?  I wouldn't think so, but Agricola manages to make a decent game of it.  Standard worker placement fare: grab the spots that are most valuable or needed, hope the others make it back to you.  The only twist is the struggle to build your food engine in the beginning, when you have nothing, and get it running fast enough to hit all the benchmarks the game imposes on you.  

The family game is really not all that interesting, and not something I'd play repeatedly.  You really need the cards to make it good, and I've already started to get tired of the 'E' deck ones.  For more spice, add the draft variant.  

The game as a whole is just a little too much 'chore' and too little 'leisure' for my tastes, so I won't want to play that often.  I've only a couple criticisms apart from that.  
Start player is extremely critical, since you have a lot of knowledge as to what actions will be available on what turns.  Sitting to the right of the person who's always camping on it can ruin your game.
A minor complaint, but it always feels to me like the animal and baking builds are way different from each other in terms of ease.  For baking, you just have to take grain 2-3 times early, grab some clay or stone, and build the oven to make your first batch.  Somewhere in there, get a field, then plant one of the grain, and hopefully bake another.  After that, it's all downhill.  The only difficulty is in the uniqueness of the spots you have to grab.  (There isn't any substitute for the sow/bake spot).  Whereas, for animals, you have to compete with everyone else for the piles of lumber, get enough for at least a small pasture, then take the fence spot to build it.  Then, of course, you need the animals to fill it, which means waiting for sheep to accumulate on the sheep space and being the one to snag them.  Finally, you'll need a fireplace to cook them.  The main problem with this is that you really want to be spending that lumber expanding your house, and fences compete with that.
Card power level is also quite varied.  Some look cool, but won't actually do much; others you can build your whole strategy around.
I hate the fact that the lumber and clay are both wooden discs, a slightly different shade of brown from each other.  
If someone gets a lot of wood and reed early, they'll be well on their way to building the next room first.  This means they'll probably be first to grow their 3rd person, giving them a leg up on everyone else.  It's by no means a runaway leader, nor a guarantee of success, but it can be a predictor.
Farms tend to converge on similar appearances due to the scoring system.  It becomes a question of how many categories you excelled in, and it's entirely possible that people will be close to the same point total, even if they're doing well in entirely different areas.  At that point, it comes down to the bonus points on cards, which I've seen swing games.

Anyway, I still like the game.  It's probably my favorite of the whole Uwe series.

I've only played it once, so this rating could go up. We all felt like we built very poor farms and spent a lot of time feeding our family, but didn't play another because of the length of the game. Being the first to expand your family seems extremely advantageous.

-after second and third plays this is going up to a ten. We had been starting with one family member instead of two. Awesome game.

Deep strategy game with a fantastic theme that gets more addictive and fun as you gain experience as it can be punishing to new players and to more experienced ones too!

After extensive play, this game sits atop as my favorite game of all time.  Worker placement, building a farm, tension with harvests and so many things to do, along with a vast array of occs and minors to ensure no game is the same....

Love this game and still learning!

Basic game is interesting, but not as good as some other resource management games out there... on the other hand, it is uniquely rebalanced so that with a different number of players, your objectives and methods need to change as well, which is very unusual (and good).

Like the game, but the cards make for a slow start (reading), and quite frankly, I get a bit anxious waiting for my economic engine to come together on the last turn of the game.

Favorite game played for 2007.

This is the real deal and IMHO it is the ultimate worker placement game. Just when I was getting tired of this type of game Agricola renewed my interest. Fantastic with two players, and I might even prefer it with two. I expect this game to keep my interest much longer than other euros. If it does, I will give it a 10. 

Update: It did. Played 30+ times.

Buen juego, pense que era mejor, la expectativas era altas, pero haciendo honor a la verdad no he encontrado para nada malo el juego, esta bien pensado, entretenido y tiene la porcion de reto que me gusta dentro de un juego, el unico pero es que puede ser muy agobiante para jugar con la familia y es una lastima ya que la tematica esta pintada para eso.

A very simple game to learn and yet hard to master. 

14 turns aren't enough to do everything you want. So you've got to find out how to balance everything. 

The cards are the heart of the game but the family game could also be very good in introducing new players (3 or 4 turns) or new people to the hobby.

I even enjoy it more since I'm able to play with my wife (she love's it). 


A final word for the nice production of the Z-Man pre-order edition.

Solo top score - 53 points @ 25/8 Deck E

Simple variant: 
After several plays, we started to play in the same way every time. Boring. Now it's just a way to teach other how to play.

Advanced variant:
Cards are random and sometimes it could pick the winner. Much more interesting than basic game, but also much more random. Despite of this, it's still a lot of fun.

Number of players:
I prefer five player game. Because of additional "baby" action, game is less random.

Player order:
I do not see any good reason, why player order isn't working just like in Caylus : (

I like Le Havre and Lords of Waterdeep and wanted to like Agricola but can't. It's overly complicated and seems to be a game requiring you to do a very specific strategy in order to remain in balance (one path to victory). Plus the theme is pretty boring. Not the worst game ever but definitely a big disappointment for me, highly overrated on this website.

Every time I play Agricola, I like it more and more.

Played 2-player for the first time the other day and I was surprised at how much I liked it with fewer players. It plays much quicker as the analysis paralysis that inherently comes with this game was significantly reduced since there were less people to have it. This made the game play much quicker with a lot less downtime, which only increased my enjoyment of this game.

RATING: 9
I like the stress of feeding your people and the challenge of making your cards work in your favor. I still get my butt kicked, but I've got a really nice farm at the end. Looking forward to trying Le Havre.

Many more plays online than recorded here.

Edit: after playing Le Havre I much prefer Agricola. Not that Le Havre was a bad game, I still enjoyed it...but the stress of working out an efficient point scoring machine all while meeting the periodic goals of feeding your people is what puts this game over the top. Le Havre felt more like a pure exercise in efficiency, whereas Agricola feels more like that and a dollop of additional tension which gives the game the thematic feel and keeps players growth balanced. I kind of don't want to touch Caverna...

RATING: 8.85
My all time favorite euro game. It so perfectly balanced and diverse and it's fairly complex. 
It will never finish in the same way nor will strategy be repetitive, and the winner is often concluded after the final point counting in the photo finish.
The theme (building a farming household and raising a family) is really light and common and I love the fact that it attracts regular people of all ages and it repels hard core uncompromising geeks. 
Drafting occupations and minor improvements in the beginning of the game is greatly recommendable as it eliminates overpowered combos.

RATING: 6
As with most euros this failed to inspire me. The theme isn't really grabbing and whilst superficially the game is about farming most of the decisions you make seem to have little to do with farming but more about squeezing victory points from the system. So for example you might plough all your remaining land to avoid taking points penalties at the end of the game, but from a thematic point of view, why would a farmer ever do this?

It does give you plenty of options and routes to points, and i quite like the idea of the occupation and improvement cards (drafting them will probably lead to a more balanced and interesting game). However ultimately i found this to be a bit of a dull solitaire points grind. Not really what im into gaming for.

Worker Placement. Permanent member of collection.
Permanent member of my collection, since my mom gave it to me.
The box is a strong, sturdy shape.

Game plays way faster than I thought it would! I can see the depth, but it feels surprisingly light. It's just a worker placement/resource evaluation game.

RATING: 8.5
Having played this a few times through now, I'm a little more comfortable making comments.

Agricola took a little getting used to; a warm up period was necessary for sure.  But I have to say that each time I play it, I like it a little more than the time before.  The game boards and pieces will certainly *not* blow you away with their artistic flair but the game mechanics just might.  The competition for resources is pretty intense at times as is deciding when is the best time to go for that big pile of wood.  And the BIGGEST challenge of all is keeping the family fed especially toward the end of the game as harvest times come faster and faster.

The game can feel a smidgen repetitive at times if you play with the same people and they keep their same strategies, but with new people and new strategies I could see this game having immense replay value.  We like it enough and will probably play it a few times a month for now.  It may eventually get shuffled to the back of the closet ... but not any time real soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice game, if you do not include the very swingy cards of some expansions. Man, some are way too powerful. If you do, the game is basically decided not by good planning, but by the cards you get. And that is a shame.

Overall, this game is really good. You can really feel that you build something, and the struggle to feed your family is (to me) not a nuissance, but an essential part of the game that makes it harsher, but also way more interesting.

OK it is good — in fact it is bloody good — but does it deserve than number one ranking? In my book no largely because it does not have the player interaction of Caylus or the stripped down great mechanics of Puerto Rico. The huge range of occupations and improvements are great though and help to make each game different.

El segundo mejor juego al que he jugado (es bastante más estresante que Puerto Rico).

Nu 2 éve megvan a játék, sajna a német verzió, ajándékba kaptam, és hát ugye a német nyelv...és 360 kártya.Ugyan a szabályt félig én fordítottam, de aztán játék sosem lett belőle. De végre megjelent magyarul, és így már a kártyáim nekem is magyarok No és most már 2 játékon túl, egyet Payanál, hát a profi ellen nem volt esélyem, de a játék bejövős volt. Aztán immár 7 végén újra próbáltam, és igen. Szóval 2 játék alapján azt kell mondjam, h nekem a második Caylus lett. /Ugye az a top kedvencem/ Szóval jó eltalált játékmenet, a szabályok végül is nem bonyolultak, de rengeteg mindenre lehet-kell figyelni, a kártyák színt visznek bele, és rengeteg nyerő stratégia lehet - pláne, h a kártyák ugye ezen mindig variálhatnak. Ugyanakkor mivel elég keveset játszottam még, nem egyértelmű még számomra, ha  kártyák miatt mennyire válik "szerencsejátékká" vagy bármilyen kártya kombó alkalmassá tesz a játék megnyerésére. SZóval emiatt inkább 9 lenne az érték, de a játék izgalma, figyelem lekötése, pörgése miatt, tervezés, taktika stb meg inkább 10, egyelőre megelőlegezett 10. És nagy szó, h a második alkalommal, bár kezdők -mármint Agricola kezdők- játszottuk, és igen későn fáradtan kezdtünk neki, a játék során mindenki felélénkült, és végig fent tartotta mindenki figyelmét, pedig kismama is játszott, és nagy meleges, strandolós nap után voltunk.
Update 2: azóta még pár játék, eddig mindenki szerette, igen bejövősen.
Sőt: legutóbb 2 gyerek is a játszók közt /10-13 év/ és bár csak a kártya nélküli verzió, de imádták ők is.

You either love it or you hate it.  What I love about this game is that you have your own farm (board) in front of you; you make it the best farm you can and nobody can screw it up but you.  Other players will take resources you want, but you're doing the same.  The player who is best at collecting and planning wins.

RATING: 8
Enjoyed this game for quite some time, but got thoroughly sick of it.  Game can get quite redundant--new action spaces are revealed as the game progresses, but relatively little shuffling so few surprises.  Blocking by other players can be a significant problem.  It is difficult or impossible to recover once a player falls behind.  Strikes me that this game is close to being excellent, but there is a mismatch between the high level of strategy required and the relatively short number of rounds. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably the first thing that jumps out at you when you play Agricola is the very unique theme and mechanic. There aren't many farming games, and I don't think I've ever played a game that uses this mechanic (except maybe Lords of Waterdeep, but Agricola came out way before that game). Because of the randomization of cards, including the round cards, there is a lot of diversity between each play through. Depending on who you are playing with and what they are trying to accomplish effects the game drastically. This is the one game I can truly say that has no set stragedy or path to victory. Every game is different. My only gripe about this game has nothing to do with the game, but with the design of the box. The makers of this game obviously put 100% of their effort into designing the GAME ONLY, and put 0% of time thinking about storage of the multitude of pieces that come with it. Now, Agricola is not the only great game on the market that makes this mistake, but I think this game is THE WORST. The box is relatively small, and has NOTHING on the inside for storage. After punching out all the pieces you are left with a totally empty box. This is my only game that REQUIRES its own separate storage box for pieces. If the point of the small box was to give it a small footprint on your gaming shelf, then epic fail, because this game with its TWO boxes takes up more than any other. However, to now reiterate, this game rocks!

Based on 3 play. 
We tried to go with the cards from the beginning, and it wasn't bright idea. I did not know the mechanisms, and the cards bend the mechanisms and makes more from them. So I was a bit lost. Anyway I guess that after few more games the rank should rather go up then decrease, because I liked it despite the fact I did not succeed in the first game.
Revised to 8 after the second game - no additional cards this time.

RATING: 6
Played my first game. It was a 2 player game. It gave me an idea of the game's mechanics.

No interaction between players.

Reason for my rating is because there seems that you can do lots of things. What you do and how you do them(order which you do your actions), was a real puzzle for me in my first game. 

Especially towards the mid game when you got less turns to get enough food to feed your people. One time, I had not enough food and it cost me two grains. I was saving them for something else. It was very frustrating.

Seems like if you want to do something, you need to do stuff in a certain order, if you don't, you can easily shoot yourself in the foot and ruin your game.

So, for a first game,  it was a crash and burn experience. I would want to play Agricola again, but before I do I need to do some reading about the game.

Seems like there are combos you can do in this game. To spot them after only one play is difficult. There are lots of cards in this game. I didn't see most of them.

Now, since I know the game mechanics and how the game works, next step for me is looking to see if there are some actions that are more important than orders. See exactly what resources you need to do certain things.

Also, the cards you got in hand influences what kind of game you can have. If you got bad cards, it can hurt your game overall or at least you'll need more actions than other players who has good cards which gives them bonuses.

Overall, a good game, not excellent. This game is overly-hyped in my opinion. Rating can change with more plays. Not something I would buy myself due to its price tag. I don't find it interesting enough for my taste for getting my own copy.

I would play it with someone's else copy, but not mine. Paying that much for a game, it would have to be for a game I enjoy more than Agricola.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Based on several plays. 

I just don't get it. I feel as though bad (read: inexperienced) plays early in the game are compounded, and continue to punish in later rounds. The leader gets ahead and stays there (in his five-room six-worker stone mansion, while you have two starving guys in a two-room clay hut). 

Example: If you're last to place a worker, the only way to get the Start Player marker back is to waste one of your precious worker placements, and then be first player in the next round. But then you run out of food and starve at harvest time. There's no compensation for being last to pick. 

In a five-player game (which I obviously can't recommend) you run out of Kitchen-type Major Improvements, and (again) the odd-man out gets left behind.

There is no player interaction (other than competing for worker placement). Caylus has similar mechanics but a lot more player interaction.

It feels weird to give the #1 game on BGG a 3.5 rating, but honestly if Agricola what's being played, I'll go elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Long, heavy, and random! Not my thing. Long/heavy is fine and good, and so is random (occasionally), but never together.

UPDATE: Actually played now. Interesting game. I still think that the randomness of the minor improvements and the occupations are unbalancing. Getting good ones - synergistic or just overpowered - is make or break.

I enjoyed it the first time. I question whether I'll enjoy it long-term due to this issue, though. Maybe with an added drafting step - but that requires significant experience to be done at all quickly.

Pretty good with 2 players. Exacerbates skill differences, of course. Possibly exacerbates luck of the draw issues too, but my case was skill.

This is definitely the most stressful game (feeding your family is a pressure that never relents... And if it does it's probably a sign that you're losing because you're not growing your family).

An inferior, but still good, variation on Caylus. I like the theme and mechanics, but conflict on action spaces seems tacked on (I can't fish because you did), and the game lacks the kind of elegance and streamlining I'm searching for in euro games. Compensates that with lots of replay value, and a fun and good-hearted theme.

With all the love going around for this game I almost wanted to not like it, but alas I must count myself among the converted.  A ton of options and differing strategies come about every game depending on your cards.  And boy do they give you enough decks to keep the different games coming.  I take off 1/2 a point for overall game time, a slight lack of pieces, and a less than epic overall feel.  For pure strategy peeps, this is the creme de la creme.  For you newbies, having babies early and often is usually the key to victory in this one.  I won't try to draw any parallels to real life from this one, other then to state, it's always good to have a goat in your house.

I never tire of this game.  I only yearn for more.  Whenever I get around to playing it, I'm reminded that it's my favorite.  

I downloaded the app after having sold the game awhile back as I rarely got to play it.  Now I feel foolish.  This game is awesome!  It's a tense battle for the limited action spaces that comes right down to the wire, and at the end of the game you can look at the farm you built and feel proud of the family you raised up through the hard knocks of agrarian life.  

I usually end up preferring the app more than the physical game.  With Agricola; however, I prefer the physical game as I like having everything out in front me when I figuring out what to do.  The app compartmentalizes all the boards and cards in a way that makes it difficult for me to make timely decisions.

standard worker placement game. has plenty of options and routes to victory and is fun to play, yet it is not a finely crafted game. there are plenty of pointy  edges and play imbalances, with fiddly rules.

I really enjoy this game.  It is well designed, challenging, scalable, variable, and most of all, fun.  However, it always seems to get passed up when we're choosing a game to play...therefore the 9.  I would highly recommend the game, especially if you have an inconsistent number of players.

I really like that the rules are in themselves quite simple - but you have a LOT of choices. Also since only one player can take each action, your strategy keeps taking deroutes all the time. Up to the point where you have to change it - and you really don't have time for that.

There are many different paths to victory.

And I really like the feeling of building a farm. The theme integrates really well with the mechanics. It's like playing Knut Hamsuns "The Growth of the Soil".

I'm not surprised if I bump this to 9 after playing the full version.

EDIT: And I DID bump it to 9 after playing the full version. Now I just need to play it 50 times to see if it bumps to 10.

Of the many games I've played Agricola is my favourite of all  and deservedly one of the top rated games on BGG.  The farming theme is great and there's a real sense of tension as the game nears its conclusion.  There's huge replayability given all of the cards and it's an excellent and surprisingly quick game for 2 players.

While the sheer amount of cards feels like a limitless game, there's far too much AP present to enjoy this at all. There's little interaction, aside from blocking each others actions and the amount of things to cover before the end game feels rushed. The cards add a lot of diversity to the game, but keeping track of them all is tough.

60-90m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

Agricola is such a treat for me. The action selection is simple, yet cut-throat. The process of building your farm from nothing is satisfying, leaving you with a real sense of accomplishment (or failure). The card play (especially with a draft during setup) is really lovely and allows for high replay value and lets players change up their tried and true strategies.

Overall I never really see myself getting bored with this game. A rare 10 indeed.

My first Euro I bought. I loved the idea and the game is great in a lot of ways. I pull this one out when the players are more interesting in talking than getting into an intense match. The lack of player interaction makes it ideal for that kind of situation. The cards can get repetitive after playing enough games and once you figure out the best strategies it can be hard to get into if you know you will come out on top. Sometimes we have players who know the best strategies too and that does bring the game back into play but I have mostly moved on from this game.

Prefer Caverna. Not a big fan of the "feeding your family" mechanic, especially since it can be relatively difficult in this game... Feel like I spend the majority of my time worrying about food and not the rest of the game.

Another classic. I don't mind the theme, in a good or bad way. It is what it is, but at least it's done well. I love how the game limits you in your options while at the same time forces you to try to do a bit of everything in odrer not to get negative points. I know some people despise that aspect of the game, I like it very much. You could perfectly play the family version always and limit the luck of the game dramatically, but the cards open the options a lot and set the guidelines for the strategy to follow. Good game.

UPDATE: More recent games like Feast for Odin and Concordia have knocked this down a peg for me.

UPDATE: Knocking this down to a 9. I still like it but I feel this some of the things that annoy me about Agricola have been fixed in later Rosenburg games like Feast for Odin.

UPDATE: Yeah, this is probably our most played "big game." (Please ignore the fact that I keep forgetting to log my games played) I enjoy the strategy and the cards keep giving all sorts of new opportunities. I should probably just go ahead and bump this one up to a 10.

Finally bought this after a couple of plays. I really enjoy "economic machine" games and I am looking forward to more plays of this one.

After one play of the basic (family) game with 5 players I found this quite intriguing, with seemingly many things to do, though we were all (4 newbies at it) a bit lost to start with, and rated it a 7. However, we fairly quickly picked it up, and if we played a second time would certainly see more deliberate strategies played. 

Having played my newly arrived English language version, complete with Animeeples, a couple of times my rating has increased to 8. Still only played the family version which so far I've found quite complicated enough but also satisfying. Though I'm still struggling to play efficiently and am flailing around desperately trying different things. Hopefully more plays will rectify this!

A couple of plays now with the E-deck cards; not really any more complicated and in some respects more forgiving as they tend to make it easier to get enough resources and food. There are more opportunities for distraction though......now rates a 9.

A couple more games and this is a 10: I'm always happy to play it, and we've played it a couple of nights in a row by popular demand, a sign of a good game. Hasn't lost it's lustre yet!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I want to rate this higher because it's highly a strategic euro with an approachable theme, but I just can't.  The first reason is that I find it to be too fiddly.  The second is that I feel the cards introduce a catch 22: The cards seem to be a little on the unbalanced side.  To rectify this people can play the 'Family' version which has no occupations/minor improvements.  In doing so, players can't accomplish as much in the game which takes away some of the fun and more importantly there will be a LOT less variety from game to game. Drafting is another method that addresses the problem with card balance. The benefit of drafting, other than a balancing mechanism, is that you can try to draft cards to match a specific strategy you want to try rather than virtually being forced to use the strategy that you've been dealt. An example of this is having to play an early plowing strategy due to being dealt the Field Watchman. The issue with this is that drafting does add a fair chunk of time to a game already of medium to high length depending on the number of players.  After further plays I dislike the end game scoring because you're always trying to get at least some of everything, instead of doing what you want.

After further plays, I feel that the player that's able to grow their family the earliest has a huge advantage and will likely win the game.  Due to this mechanism, I don't feel that Agricola is as strong a worker placement game as Uwe's Ora et Labora, All Creatures Big and Small, and Fields of Arle.

Regardless if you like the theme or not this is a very thought-provoking game that is quite engrossing and exciting once you get the knack of it.

One can tell that Uwe Rosenberg put a lot of work into this.

The 17th Century Was Not an Easy Time to be a Farmer.  A game for 1-4 players ages 12 and up; play time is 30 minutes per player. Amazing replay value. The Agricola base game is a revised edition of Uwe Rosenberg’s celebrated classic. The game is designed for 1-4 players, features improved all-wood components and a card selection from the base game as well as its expansions, revised and updated for this edition. Players begin the game with two family members and can grow their families over the course of the game. This allows them more actions but remember you have to grow more food to feed your family as it grows! Feeding your family is a special kind of challenge and players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle. Guide your family to wealth, health and prosperity and you will win the game.

I prefer Caverna: The Cave Farmers over Agricola.

This is a really great game, close to Puerto Rico and Power Grid caliber. What's nice about this game is that it is playable for 2 players (it's better with more than 2, but still fun with only 2) and it has a solitaire option which I have not yet tried. The other nice thing is the family rules, which makes this game playable for children. My 10 year-old son really likes this game. There is something very satisfying about watching your farm grow with all of the different components. There is good dramatic tension due to the different decisions to be made and risks that you are forced to take throughout the game. The price is a bit lofty however I think this game really delivers some serious fun.

Yay, I finaly got Agricola copy #750 in the mail and spent the night going over the rules...

Fisrt Impression: Ugh, who wrote this? The rule book is a jumbled mess, not to mention being full of grammatical errors! I'm sorry. but the game doesn't seem THAT complicated to warrant such convoluted rules.

So far off to a bad start.

OK, I played a few actual games... It's good, but really no better then many similar games; Caylus, Puerto Rico, POE, etc. Really the only thing making it "cool" has to be the theme (which sucked me in), get rid of that and you have a decent run-of-the-mill game with a fidly board (comprised of cards laying all over) and a badly writen rule book.

RATING: 4
I have issue with the identical scoring which forces you to do everything (because if you don't - negative points!)  I think a lot of the intial game moves at the start are too obvious (and repetitive) and the feed-your-people phase is just an onerous chore.  Even the designer seems to agree as a lot of these concepts have been reworked or removed in his much better successors (Le Havre, Ora et Lab, Glass Road, Caverna, Odin).  If those never existed I would have a high rating here, but as they do, old Agricola no longer merits more than a 5.  I think a lot of the reviews on BGG also reflect this and I suspect were probably posted prior to Caverna or Le Havre being released.  Great components, but so many are a pain to sort out and store, so no grade impact for them.

RATING: 5.75
First play rating of 7.25 a composite of my rating (7.5) and my sister's rating (7).  Played 2 player game.  Rating may improve a half point if, as I suspect, the game has more tension and tough decisions with more players.

Update: on a second play with 3 players, rating slipped down to 5.75, a composite of my rating (5.5) and my sister's rating (6).  Wife's rating of 4 not factored in, as she was exhausted and somewhat sick.  In that condition, she found the game too busy and confusing.

While the use of Occupation, Minor Improvement and Action cards creates many permutations, ultimately I found the game a bit boring.  Precisely because of the randomness introduced by all of the cards, it becomes difficult to formulate long-term strategy, and play becomes more tactical, as players react to changes in circumstances which can sometimes be hard to predict.

Victory conditions requiring a balanced farmyard seem to sap the game of interest, homogenizing strategies and making the game feel like a rather dry exercise in resource optimization.  The very appealing animeeples and veggimeeples were not enough to generate much excitement.  Playing the game is fun, but fiddly bits and numerous options make for work as well, and the latter almost overshadows the former.

At least for us, the claim on the box that it takes 1/2 hour per player is ridiculously inaccurate.  We find that about 1 hour per player is more accurate.

In all, a mildly interesting game with fabulous production value, but not worthy of the lovefest it has engendered here on BGG.

I didn't like it the first time. After couple of plays I started to develop some love to the game. The cards really makes this game fly. It gives the game many diferent strategies. However this game i think personally has a relatively low replayability because every game has some standard procedure u have to do in order to get a high score. The cards only provide effectiveness towards some accomplishment  so u can save some time to do others.

RATING: 9
The quintessential worker placement, with an array of winning strategies to analyze. The Occupation and Minor Improvement cards offer interesting combinations to explore, but are difficult to fully utilize, which as the main source of game-to-game variety is unfortunate. The scarcity of food and resources is oppressive, especially for new players, but as an experienced gamer I cherish this. You'd never expect farming, and the ever-looming harvest, to invoke such intense stress and worry, but these emotions work to quickly immerse players into Agricola's bleak world. While many will point to agriculture as the theme, I would argue that Agricola is a story of scarcity. There will never be enough resources, or workers, or time, to complete all of your goals, but you have to do the best with what you have. It may be simple life but it's hard as hell.

RATING: 3
Based on app play. Taking excerpts from other negative comments and reviews...

"A game should, even in the lightest of ways, feel adventurous driven by player autonomy. Agricola is, for lack of a better term, deterministic in that players lose points if they don't do everything, and so a player cannot choose to do something. And that which a player so happens to do is never surprising, determined by that which grants bonus points. This, and not even necessarily the punishing points system, is my biggest problem with Agricola."

"Very mechanical, very fiddly, and a little overwhelming in the number of actions. Its very hard to see a clear path to victory because this game penalizes specialization and rewards doing poorly in different fields. It never feels like you get to enjoy advancing your farm (or managing it the way you want to) as you do rushing to take actions before someone takes them from you."

"In Puerto Rico, one builds, so even in last place, I feel like the least *successful* player. Agricola is about fighting the game and often destroying what you've built before (crops, herds), so even if I were to win, I think I'd feel like the least *failing* player."

Just very punishing and unintuitive without a satisfying payoff.

A fun game that never gets old because you can never play it the same way twice due to the Occupations & Minor Improvements. I like this much more than Le Havre becuase, even though your goal is always approximately the same in Agricola, the path you take to get there has to be redetermined with every hand, and every play that the other players make.
This even plays way differently per number of players because of the added action cards.

I don't know how cool I am with the incredible randomness the hands give this game. I'd consider drafting cards into your hand, but I don't know how that investment of additional time would equal an increase in return. Also, thought the interactive deck was pretty nasty though. 

Don't get me wrong, I still think this game is pretty, pretty, pretty good. 

My biggest qualm with this game is the AP the optimization element of the game brings. If your move was taken by the player before you, you're going to have to think of a new move that scores the most points/does the most for you, and this can take a little longer than I'd like. 

9 to 7: I've got my play out of it after 12 plays. I just don't think it's as fun as it used to be. For every big decision, I feel there's a fair amount of forced decisions and waiting.

I am really impressed on how complicated the rules first seemed, but on the other hand how smooth the game actually plays when you are aware of the basic concepts of the game. Also the almost endless possibilities are very impressive and should really provide some long-term motivation. And with a pimped up version (animeeples, veggimeeples and ressourceeples) it is even more fun!

RATING: 5.5
I've played this 30+ of times, mostly 2 player, and changed my rating more than once.  I really have mixed feelings about it.  The game has a lot going for it - a lot of resource management and optimization that is a lot of fun.  And yet I tend to get frustrated with it, in a way that I don't with better games like Caylus and Puerto Rico.  

I think that essentially my complaint is the lack of player interaction.  Sure, it has some player interaction, mostly of the blocking kind, but I think it must fall below some sort of critical threshold for me.  When I play Agricola I don't really feel as if I am playing against the other players as I do with Caylus or Puerto Rico - instead I feel like I am playing against the game, aiming for a new high score, and the other players are just distractions.  Except that they are darn annoying distractions, who every so often really mess you up.  And so instead of the thrill of competition (I really do enjoy tight, competitive games), I just get frustrated.  

Also, I'm not a big fan of the randomness in the cards - I almost prefer the family game.  

In general, I find this game very interesting, and if I am in the right mood and can manage to take it lightly (not easy for a game that does require a certain amount of tactical thought), I do enjoy it.  But many other times I have been left feeling frustrated or disappointed, and so I am afraid the best I can give it is a 6.5  

Update 1/5/2012 - sold the game, and downgraded it to a 6.

2 5-player games, one with Intermediate deck and one with Beginner deck.

This is an enjoyable game.  I still shirk at comments of "These cards suck", "That is too powerful", and "You have to play xxxx way" due to the fact that with only a few plays... I know we haven't seen what there is to offer so far.  The game on the surface does have a solitaire type feel, HOWEVER this is probably due to the fact that I have been very self-absorbed in trying to get my economy going.  I did try on my second game to focus on farming and was largely successful (2 people until final round).  So, I don't think comments of "_A_ way to play" is justified.  I have pre-orded the game from Z-Man games.  My wife is not big on conflict games, and will probably play it; which is reason enough for me to purchase a copy.  Current rating is an 8 until I get a better feel for the game.  Update: received game and my wife, her parents (non-gamers), and my gaming thoroughly enjoy it.

Have played about 10 more times.  Still agree with my initial rating.

A very compelling game. So many factors to consider. Does add to some serious downtime (5 players could be too many) but you don't really notice it because you're too busy thinking yourself. There are a multitude of cards but it doesn't feel that the card draw decides the game (although there seems to be some cards that are just crap and there's virtually no incentive to play them).

Not a perfect game then, but it works pretty well and has an interesting enough theme to engage players.

RATING: 9
Deep, frequently stressful, always fun.

The game has a ton of variety and paths to victory due to the many Minor Improvement and Occupation cards.

About halfway through the game, when you really start feeling the pressure to feed your family, it can get very stressful and I frequently say, "Why do we play this game!?" But I always want to play more.

Great replayability and wonderful theme.

Great game that really shines when everyone knows how to play. A bit of a learning curve, especially for newer players. Replay is also high, and I have found that playing different strategies based on cards in hand can be very fun. Not a huge chance for the same game twice. A tad lengthy for the type of game it is imo.

What I like:  Multiple paths to winning, and with so many variables even if you have a standard strategy, you usually have to vary from that and play to the game before you.  Yes, having the Animeeples makes a difference.  [re sleeves] I intentionally bought the Mayday sleeves because the edges aren't as sharp, but out of 4 packages I ditched most of the sleeves because they didn't fit.  I forced cards into others and now regret doing so because the FF sleeves fit perfectly.

I just absolutely adore this game for so many reasons:
- really, really solid game. Not much luck involved
- you can't go for the same strategy every game. The cards give you new directions every time, which adds to the replayability (and it still doesn't bore me after 100s of I plays!)
- I like the player interaction. No direct aggression and almost all information is available to all players. However, since there is some tense competition for the action spaces you do have to watch other players very carefully.
- The tension in this game is great. I know many people who find it exhausting to provide food every harvest. They complain that the game is over before they really 'get going'. But I like it that you can't do everything every game, which makes every game different and interesting for me.

Having played three times now, I just don't get the hype around this game.  It's clever and complex, but it's just not much fun.  I do like the way there are many possible strategies; I'm less keen on how long it takes to play out, so trying different strategies to see what might work is a very time consuming process.

On my first play, it felt like there was a certain amount of imbalance in getting resources depending on how close one sat to the starting player and which occupation cards were dealt.  (Yes, I know there's an action to take start player marker, but if the person on your right does this often, you're in a better position than if the person on your left does so.) I imagine that with experience one learns the best way to play with one is dealt, and I'm told by friends who have played a lot that it is a game that gets better when players are experienced.  I suppose that climbing this learning curve could be satisfying in a group where the same people played together often and learned together.  But I remain to be convinced that the time investment is worth it (for me), compared to spending those hours playing (for me) more enjoyable games.

That said, I'd be willing to try it again if someone else really wants to play.  But not very often. (Jul 13)

Relatively short games. Scales well from 2 - 5 players. Each game is different due to the set of occupation and minor improvements you are dealt at the beginning. It's a very stressful game towards the end, especially for new players because it is hard to determine how well you are doing. It's not uncommon for a new player to think they are losing, when in fact they are in the lead!

Have mixed feelings.  Enjoy the type of game and mechanics of it.  That said, the game just lasts too long and not enough changes as the game goes on to hold interest.  If play time could be cut down, I'd want to play it more often.  But when playing with 4-5 people, the game takes 2+ hours to play and time between turns suffers.

Finally got to play Agricola. It didn't impress me much. The rulebook is awful, had to watch a couple of videos to understand the game play.  Once you understand how it plays, the game flows easily.  This is a game in which the time ends before you could do everything you wanted. You’re always struggling to feed your family, and sometimes this takes the fun away from the game.  It has a lot of variety and all the games can be different, that's a plus.  I need to play more to see if the rating increases.

Unique game with a fun goal of building a family farm. Almost no luck and all strategy...some cards can make a "lucky" difference though.  The game has great replay value because of all the cards but this is also the reason I don't think its as great as Puerto Rico...PR needs no deck changes, its great everytime as the basic game. The setup and teardown as well as instruction reference is a little more than PR also. This is a definitive top 5 game for me, prob top 3 most days. Would play any time.

I quite thought this was a game about farming, but in my game (with skilled players), nothing happened until the last turn when everyone suddenly built fences everywhere.  That's not exactly how farming works.

I hate special powers and I hate worker placement, so this is not my sweet spot for sure.  My appreciation for auction mechanics is improving rapidly, where real values can be placed on actions.

A worker placement game where you are each controlling a farmer and his wife on your personal farm board in order to make the most points. The box comes chock full of components, artwork is lovely and components are well done – sturdy cardboard, wooden animals etc., rulebook takes a bit of time to wade through but it's all well organised and we could find what we needed no problem, well designed I guess...I mean it won awards so it must be OK. 

However, the setup is too long for the lack of fun generated, a vast amount of table space is required, cards lack variety but give the illusion of many options with its hundreds of cards but many cards are in fact duplicated, game is very prescribed – diversification is rewarded and specialisation is not, so you must follow a certain formula to win and as a result you both end up with practically identical farms at the end *yawn*. I also don't like games that leave out tons of components when playing with different player counts – I've never had a chance, and never will, to try any of the cards from 3-5 players which is about half of each of the decks (many of which look much more interesting) and along with Alhambra and Keyflower this game made us realise we don't like games where players are focused on their own village play area. We'd rather all the action take place on a central board.

It feels like a 3+ player game and was just a very MEH experience for us from the first play to play 10. I got this one in because we loved Loyang so much, and many comments I read here state outright that Agricola is the better game. We, however, didn't find that to be the case. We found it same-y after a handful of plays, I find it incredibly dull and my gaming partner finds it frustrating because he doesn't have the time to bring all his plans to fruition. We will stick to At the Gates of Loyang in the future.

RATING: 6
It's a bit convoluted for my taste. It seems like everything you try to accomplish takes several workers - and you only start out with two.

Feeding your people is a central part of the game and a real nuisance. There's always a feeling of dread because you don't have time for everything - and because of the way scoring works, you have to do a bit of everything.

Having 14 different cards at the beginning of the game is pretty neat, but it can lead to some serious analysis paralysis and most of the cards you don't get to use anyway. The way the cards work isn't very streamlined and the return on investment is very slim. In the end, it just doesn't feel that satisfying to me.

I love the wooden animal meeples, but really dislike the art on the cards. I've also upgraded some of the discs to MeepleSource farmers.

I will have to play it with 3 or 4 players to see if that changes my mind.

This is an extremely tight game that punishes every player no matter how well you do. It manages to make you regret a move you did 4 turns back and every single time I play you feel as though I have accomplished nothing until the last couple rounds where everything that has been building up finally comes together in one beautiful creation. Balanced so well that almost every game you will be one resource away from accomplishing your final plan unless you have planned perfectly. Just enough player interaction to not feel like multiplayer solitaire and only passive aggressive actions.

Comes with a version to play with families, as well as being a good game in its own right.  As a worker placement game, it has similar mechanics to games like Stone Age and Pillars of the Earth, but the cards give this more replayability. Don't miss the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/340902]Wine-label review: A Wine-taster's Guide to Agricola[/url].
This game seems to be as good as they say - quick play time, lots of options with different cards every game, nice components, solid theme, not too complex, all round goodness!  
The English edition does seem to have [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/326815]a fair amount of errors[/url], hopefully these will be corrected in a future edition soon (most recently, recommended changes to [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/612645/official-changes-on-2-cards]two cards[/url]).  Great game, but it can fry your brain, very tense gameplay in a short amount of time.  I like the fact that it's not very confrontational, and to some extent each game is a challenge against yourself.

Areas that are downsides for me personally:
1. too tense and too short, doesn't allow you time to do everything you want
2. makes diversity mandatory, arguably taking away from focusing on multiple paths to victory (at least in the Family game)
3. cards can advantage players depending on what they draw
More of my thoughts: [thread=730206]here[/thread].

For an alternative viewpoint along similar lines, see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/461632]UndeadViking[/url]: "[i]When I play Agricola I have a two hour session of minimal player interaction coupled with me putting a puzzle together that always ends up looking the same when I am finished. Sometimes the pieces I have to use are a little different, but it always looks the same in the end ... For what it is, it is as close to perfect as I have found, and for the right people, it is gaming nirvana. However, for me, it is a tired, ponderous time of pushing and placing wood tokens at a table with a few friends doing the same thing, in which all of us are stuck on our farming treadmills until we reach a conclusion that is neither a surprise, nor as fitting a reward for the efforts we just went through.[/i]"

See some of my thoughts in this article: [thread=730206][/thread].  

Agricola vs Caverna: Agricola is quite restrictive and punishes you if you go wrong; in contrast Caverna is more flexible/open.  Agricola forces you to meet specific objectives and feels your family, and feel more like a struggle for survival than positively building a farm, while Caverna lets you build what you like more.  However Agricola has more player interaction and more replayability due to variable cards.

Agricola sits in the pantheon of worker placement games, and is one I still enjoy very much. The cards are frequently mentioned as a gamebreaker for some people. For me, they’re specifically why I like this game. The cards break rules or give you bonus powers such that the w-p decision space is different every time. 

Here, you get 14 secret powers at the start of the game which adds another dimension of figuring out how to play them in concert with each other as well as classically tight board actions. In fact, I've always thought Agricola is a game about which cards you do not play, i.e., which ones you decide aren't worth the benefit they confer relative to good old, boring board actions. I've seen players plop down an occupation a turn and have all these cool benefits only to see the game end before they could make use of them. Smarter players will play just enough at just the right times and not be seduced into more. While you'll do some of the same things each game, you'll do a lot differently based on which cards you play. The power of those cards generates a feeling of promise and an excitement unique to Agricola. 

So what I'm saying is while the worker placement in Agricola would probably be an interesting enough game, it's the cards that make the game transcend to a level of constant fascination and give it some oomph. To be adept at this game, you need great worker placement skills along with card discernment. I do think drafting is a necessity lest someone end up with the better cards, but I find a draft of some sort solves this potential problem.

OLD review: Only played once, but liked it only toward the end. It took me a long time to figure out what was going on (seems more complex than Puerto Rico even) but once I finally got the hang of it I enjoyed it. My one critique is that it needs a reference sheet like Puerto Rico does on the back page of the instruction manual for the players who end up sitting at the table looking at the game board upside-down. I was really confused for much of the game!

RATING: 10
Great game. I think that in terms of strategy games go, Agricola paves the way. Even though I consistently find flaws in the game play, every game continues to surprise me as well as make me want to play more.

Have played most often with two players and it definitely gets boring without expansions. Love 3+ game, really gives a different experience every time you play. Strategy is demanding. 

Winner is usually person with least strategical flaws although usually can make a couple of mistakes and still win. Aggressive play can be a good strategy if you play aggressively with the right actions.

Not a good game to play against recent learners if you have a decent amount of plays under your belt.  

This game is a ten until I find something I enjoy more (may never happen).

RATING: 7
Tense game with interesting decisions, but not very fun unless you get a good combination of cards at the beginning of the game. There's a game design adage that goes something like "players should be doing the thing that makes your game fun most of the time." But in Agricola, players are constantly being forced to feed their workers instead of working toward interesting goals and card combos. So I totally understand the 'Misery Farm' nickname this game has earned.

Gaming: We are beginning to really like this game. I think it's going to take several more plays to fully realize it's potential. Update: Even though I really like it... everyone else won't play it anymore for various reasons. I keep lowering the score due to the lack of flexibility the game provides for my various gaming groups. i.e. the attitude pervades: it's too long, too boring, too solitaire, etc. Update 2: I love the game... So I found people to play it with. Score is going back up.

What else can be said about Uwe's masterpiece that hasn't already said.  I personally think this game far surpasses Caverna and Le Havre.  This game is tight from start to finish with every round involving a tough decision.  I love the 'feed the people' mechanic and the scoring where you have to do good in all areas or the game punishes you.  

Since my wife and I have a large game collection, it only comes to the table sporadically, and so by the time we get it back out we want a rules refresher again.  So we play the 'family' variant most times.  Even then, this game is fantastic and I even think it's got some good replayability in this form.  

I really like that the full version gives you some direction to focus on for strategy with your opening hand.

I own the farmers of the moor expansion - like this as well, but play it even less often.

Out of all the Uwe Rosenberg games, this is my favorite.  Less forgiving than Le Havre or At the Gates of Loyang and more complex than Bohnanza, it strikes just the perfect balance that I look for.  Also, I love that depending on how many players are playing, strategy must change and the usefulness of certain occupations/improvements varies.

RATING: 9.5
Played at BGG.con.If at all possible, play with someone who has played before and really knows the rules. Also, don't plan on winning your first game out. There are simply too many options available to make a novice happy. I predict multiple plays will result in a greater love for this one.We had a guy mess up early and by mid-game he got up and walked away from the table never to return. He used some awesome swear words too. Anyway, the game is not exactly forgiving of early mistakes and for the first couple plays, you should expect to make some early mistakes.In the end, I enjoyed the game, but I kept asking myself if having twenty million different paths to victory really makes for a better experience than five paths to victory.

UPDATE: A few years later and I finally broke down and purchased the game. Mostly because I made a new friend who doesn't mind playing brain-burner type games. Well, I've played again (one time Solo and once with Kim) and my experience has been much better. I've raised my rating from a 7 to an 8.5 and actually look forward to seeing this hit the table in the near future. I'm going to say that Le Havre is responsible for my turn around. It was good enough that I decided to give Uwe Rosenberg's first game another chance. One thing I've learned about this game is if you have a jerk playing with you (as I did the first time) you won't enjoy it much.

Agricola is a great game, a near platonic ideal of what a tense euro-game should be.  There is real tension between all you WANT to do and all you CAN and MUST do; time is always against you.

The lack of direct player confrontation is not a problem.  Like many classic euro games, there is plenty of indirect manipulation of resources and actions that make this an interactive experience.  Consequently, no one strategy seems to always work and flexible game play and tactical changes are needed to do well.

The myriad of minor improvement and occupation cards continue to provide new tricks and strategies that keep this game fresh. What drops this to a nine for me however is that some of these card combinations are clearly better than others.  This at times seems to unbalance the game depending on your starting hand, though it can be mitigated somewhat with better play. 

Agricola is well deserving of all of the praise, and will likely have staying power as (one of) the best.

Tried family games with family. The kids liked it mainly because of the theme.
[08/08] Tried Normal game. Could not figure out what the cards are and got trashed. Although come to 2nd (47-37-30-...), still feel just try to finish the game asap. Caylus is much better.
[5/2009] Played with some unfriendly chaps. Not very helpful for me to learn to play better. They played cards without announcing, did the admin stuff without letting you know what was gonig on. Made you feel inappropriate to examine their cards played on the table. No such problem in Caylus or PR (hide your cubes is so noticeable. Half-cover your cards is excusable.)

I really wanted to like this game, but I was underwhelmed by the actual play. I don't mind the dry farmer theme. I don't even mind the multiplayer solitaire feel. The part about the game that frustrated me so much was the feeling that I never really *finished* it; it just ended. There is so much to do and the times I played I could not finish even half of the things that scored points and thus got a very low score. The other frustrating part was the actual role selection; if someone took the action you really needed you had to rethink your entire strategy and there were usually no good options. I don't feel this way about other two top ten games I've played, Power Grid and Puerto Rico. Neither of those get me feeling so frustrated and incomplete.

After I played "At the Gates of Loyang" I realized how much I really loathe this one, and I dropped the rating from 5 to 3.

[2014 September 15; 5 plays; 9/10]
This is one of my favorite games, and I suspect it may always stay in my top ten, and as of right now, I can only imagine its rating growing from a 9 to a 10.

The things I love about Agricola are not highly unique, and are probably better stated by a better writer than I:

[user=chally][/user]

[q="chally"]Agricola will always remain among my top-rated games, and, to me, it is characterized by two features that I think it does better than nearly any game.

First, it is archetypal of one style of Eurogame that I enjoy immensely: that in which players struggle within the confines of a highly restrictive game system, creating tension simply from the panic that players experience trying to keep their heads above water. Agricola is the only game that has made me literally sweat at I'm performing my last action or two. It's not that the decisions are all that hard, but optimal play requires careful sequencing that is easily thrown off by the choices of others. Working flexibility and a backup plan into the game is the true source of challenge. Particularly with three players (which is my preferred number of players for games), the tension toward the endgame is unbearably delicious 

Second, Agricola does the single-best job of any game in my collection integrating theme with gameplay (especially impressive when you consider just how many occupation and improvement cards there are). If I plow a field in Agricola, my thought process is: well I ought to plant something to put this thing to use. And if I plant some grain, I can bake bread later, which will require an oven, so maybe I'll get some clay now while it's cheap. None of this is explicitly in terms of victory points, or action/opportunity costs (although those do help guide and shape more tactical decisions). At this stage, I'm just trying to build a cool farm in a game about farming. And building a cool farm is a winning strategy, so there's no thematic disconnect. The farming feels like farming; the snozberries taste like snozberries.[/q]

I've played 5 times now, and that is the only thing keeping it from a higher rating, but each of those plays it has blown me away!

I find the scoring that forces you to diversify not very interesting. The occupation and improvement cards do make it a bit more varied.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A masterclass of visual design, deep-game design, player-scale design and presentation design (no one can forget the animeeples). 
Arguably one of the most thematic games of the last decade, Agricola does not treat you with satin gloves. You feel the grind with every move, every round, every encroaching harvest, winter coming closer and closer.
The game, without occupations, is tough to muscle through the first few times, and once everyone is on the same playing level the start-game drafting catapults the game to near-perfection levels.
Probably the most notable Worker Placement game on the market, it arrived only two short years after the creator of the genre, Caylus, to make farming one of the most exciting, and terrifying, experience you can have with your friends.

RATING: 8
A typical game where you want to do much more than you are able to. The action selection mechanisms are one of the best in the world. Though, the game tends to last a little longer than I like.
I must admit that I like games where the most experienced players win (at least for this type of game). What I dislike about this game is that the strategies seem given. You must have enough family members. Otherwise you are lost. And when you have many family members, you need enough food to feed them. Therefore, it is given to go for the major improvements that convert animals or vegetables into food (there is no point in acquiring family members if you only use them for gaining food). The other given thing is that you must do everything. Otherwise you will lose too many points (since you get minus points for each missing object).
But all in all a very good game where the fight between the different actions makes the game really tense and interesting.

I've played around 15 games of Agricola and I can say that this is about as close as you can get to a perfect game.  The only issue that I have with the game is that each additional player in the game dramatically adds to the required time for a game.  To the point where a 5 player game will take around 3-4 hours unless all of the participants are seasoned Agricola players.

Edit:  I've played 50-60 games of this now and I still consider it the best board game I've ever played.

Some people love the variability in setup and how it improves replayability -- but it drives me a little bit mad when I feel like I've lost the game before the first round.

I'd almost rather play the "family" version of this game more than the full version.  I suspect Le Havre would be more my speed for that reason.

Caverna mostly fires this game for me, although I wouldn't mind trying this again.  Wouldn't be the first time I've changed my mind on something like this.

[b]Sold 7/9/2017[/b] - I like Agricola, but anyone who would want to play it with me already has a copy, and more importantly there are other games in similar styles that I like much, much better.  I probably wouldn't have let this go, but A Feast for Odin has all the cardplay variability, but the sandbox feeling you get in Caverna.

While I enjoy the brain burning aspects of Agricola, it's quite dry, and I always find the restocking of the resources to feel a bit fiddly.  I think this is a game that I would probably rate higher, if I was able to get it to the table more often.  It seems like the kind of game that gets better with more plays.

Since this is a top rated game I thought I should probably play it before criticizing it. I asked a friend to bring it along and we dutifully gave it a game.

One of the other players dislikes it, and so was a little negative the whole play through and I admit I slipped into it too.

The theme is sooo boring and like Puerto Rico everybody has to be at the same level or newbies get schooled!
Being stuck as last player repeatedly, I found I had very little options for my turn and to be honest halfway through the game I couldn't care less. I could see no way to catch up and was just falling further and further behind.
That said this is a beautifully made game. The components are top quality and you get plenty of resource tokens. It is a  bit weird that only two of the player boards have spaces to store everything and the others just have woodlands... but this doesn't affect game play.

Overall I think I was as miserable playing this game as my two little people in their small drafty wooden hut!

RATING: 7
First play as a learning exercise. It's interesting but not exciting. Another get-resource-pay-resource-develop-position-get-better-resource-score points game, with a lot of negative points for failing to do simple stuff. Again, the only inter-action is in taking something before another player, and this happened to me three times, severely cramping my growth. But Agricola does have good points, the way the cards  and resource flow into the game, the way you can grow in various ways, there are options. But it's still much of a muchness, and much like similar games, maybe better done.

Played again, and amazingly won with 44pts. I liked it more, but it's still an engine game. I had a better idea of what to do this time, and I'm more inclined to play now. But still not mad on it.

Awesome game.  The replayability is super high with the amount of cards included!  You can literally play several hundred games with a completely different flavor each time.  I've only played a couple games so far, but I do have a few minor squibbles:

1) My biggest concern is that the game (with equally competent players) may actually be decided by luck favoring the player who receives the best Occupation & Minor Improvement cards.  Perhaps a card draft or using the Interactive Deck will counter this.  I have only played with the basic "E" deck at this time.

2)  For a $70 MSRP game it would have been nice to include a quality usable insert and better artwork.  The green & tan color scheme is fairly dull; but I guess it doesn't matter too much since there is so much else going on for it.

3)  The board that displays the Major Improvement cards is completely unnecessary.  A better design would be to create a spot for the stack + have spots for other goods and/or features.  A slightly bigger & better designed 2-sided player aid may also be worthwhile.  

My rating can easily go up to a 10 (or down to an 8-9) depending on the revelation of the balance of the cards.  Otherwise, it could possibly be a waste of 3 hours - but still a very fun one at that (1st game was 4.25 hrs, 2nd game was 2.75 hrs - both w/5 players).  Grade: A-

One of the best worker placement game.
It is not for every one.
But once you learned the basic tactics the game is simple.

1) Create a source of food
2) Expand your house
3) As soon as you can expand your family.
4) keep expanding your family
5) get more points.

Heavy on strategy yet much more thematic than Caylus or El Grande.  The option to play a solo game or a simplified family game to teach the basic principles are very welcome here, and the three decks of cards that come with the game allow for a huge amount of variety.

RATING: 9
This was a game that I played a lot when it initially came out, but then I took a break from it, as Le Havre (which I still think is the better game by just a bit) occupied more of my interest.  I have since returned to it, and the second time around, it seems like an even better game.  While you always need to score in everything, how you can get there changes every game; the cards really give this game freshness and variety.  In the long run, this theme and design has also proven remarkably rich, as expansions and decks continue to be released.

RATING: 10
Rating is 10 with Farmers of the Moor, 9.5 without.

Agricola is an extremely tight game, where almost each move involves tense and difficult decisions. I enjoy the mix of both short-term tactics and long-term strategy, and the intricate dance of ensuring you get what you need while denying your opponent what he or she needs. The occupations and minor improvements keep the game fresh and varied each time. The theme may be about farming, but the graphic design is functional, and some of the art is genuinely funny.

The Farmers of the Moor expansion is a worthy addition to the game, by adding a more puzzle-like spatial element to one's farm layout, introducing new scoring elements such as horses, and also rebalancing some aspects of the base game such as making early renovation more important. One disadvantage of the expansion is that it adds a bit more leeway to the game, such as by adding more (but admittedly not efficient) ways to get food, and granting extra actions. This makes the game slightly less tight in my opinion, but I find the added variety to be (you guessed it) a major improvement.

Played one game — so far. The game seemed okay at the beginning, but the player's positions were so horribly influenced by the bloated carcass that was the card deck, that any hope of strategy quickly went out the window. The game feels fat and lazy; lolling around on its rather ponderous backside, calling for the players to fetch it another round of treats. 

I'd play this again, probably a few times, but so far I'm just not seeing the attraction. Lassies and laddies, before you go off about the wonderous card decks, let me state that this feature is the primary problem with the game. This victim of scope creep, feels and plays like a Frankenstein's monster, that people couldn't stop adding bits to. Look — this monstrosity already has two heads and four arms, why can't we just apply the juice and call it a day?

While some games suffer from too short of a development time, this one seems to have the opposite problem. Culling the cards by 75% might make a quicker, leaner game, but we're a bit too far down the road for that. 

Will I play this game again? Yes, certainly. May I learn to enjoy it? Maybe. My rating may go up in the future, but let's wait and see regarding that proposition.

[b]This highly variable farming game is, in my opinion, the greatest game of all time.[/b]

My rating history: 10...9...8...9.10.......................

2016: Still my favourite game of all time. It helps to have a few expansion decks to keep things fresh for 2p, as the card pool for 2p is not all that large for someone who plays as often as I do. I am very curious to see what 2017's Collectors Edition brings. The Revised edition is nice, but has such a small card pool. :/

2014: Back up to a 10. I now LOVE the competitiveness of this game, watching resource stacks and predicting needs and ways to beneficially interfere.

40th play: 10. Still going strong. The cards and the pressure are what make this better than Caverna for me.

50th play: 10. 4p. No animals and -6 space pts, but 5 family members, 5 stone rooms, and 14 pts in cards for the win.
52th play: 10. (2p) My first 2p draft led to me playing down 9 cards...which took too many actions, and left me too unfocused, and got one of my opponents a first tie (34-34). Note to self: FOCUS! =)

60+ plays, still rate a 10. Just so good.



2011: The more I play it the less I care about "competing" with the other players, and the more I care about building a perfect farm. Something about the game doesn't seem that competitive (which is why this game gets the "multi-player solitaire" label from a lot of people) but the challenge present in the game, and the race to certain spots on the board give it a sense of challenge to all. I have knocked this from a 10 to a 9, but I honestly don't think I'll ever get sick of Agricola. The extra decks included with the game give you a new challange every time. A real delight, and the "family game" rules are simple enough, I think even young gamers could play with a little help.


2009: I wouldn't want to play this with 5 players again, but -- wow! What a game! Wonderfully themed (you can pretty much explain the game in theme, which is fun), and a rewarding game experience.

RATING: 6.7
Family version takes about 1/2 hr. per person to play.  The interactive version we enjoy more, but takes more time--not the actual play, but the preparation prior to play when deciding which combination of occupations and minor improvements is best.  There is such a hugh possibility of combinations & it takes time to consider them all, so I don't see planning time being cut much.  Actual play (the rounds) can be very fast.  Don't like the expert deck.  When someone gets the card that allows them to get an extra family member in the first two rounds, gives them the game.

Never enough turns and lots of hard choices which increase as the game progresses.  Important to get extra people (for extra turns) as early as possible without struggling for food, or eating all your points up.  Early on building resources most important--especially for the extra room for the extra turns & oven for more efficient food production.

RATING: 5
After several plays I've lost my enthusiasm for this one.  It's quite fun designing your farm but processes are very slow and I've never managed to plant a vegetable.  To collect enough wood to build a decent fence takes most of the game. The later phases with the necessity to provide food almost every round means that the same processes have to be carried out several times.  
Also there is quite a lot of replacing of bits and turning cards over and usually one bit or card gets forgotten.

An earthier spin on Caylus with tons of ways to help a gamer lose his way in fourteen rounds.  Not sure I will only need a few more plays to get better at this one, but I had fun in my first try.  Extremely important to get a litte bit of everthing on your farm, and keep an eye on your foodstock.  Very nice.  The game is a very different experience depending on the number of players.  It's fun to get 5 to play as we see new cards with interesting effects.

Wow, what a fantastic game, I'm hooked!  (08/26/08)  I'm beginning to think this game has much wider appeal than I initially expected.  It's like a big toy with different parts that you get to play with and see what happens.  I think that aspect really broadens the appeal for the game.

[Update] I'm a little concerned that family growth dominates all other strategies.  Perhaps this isn't really an issue but I'm dropping it a full point as a result.

I have a much better idea of how to play this game, and the limited actions and feeding requirements no longer make me feel claustrophobic. I know how to line up synergistic actions, play for flexibility, watch for others' priorities, and score points as I play rather than just at the end.

The variance of the cards peeves me a bit, but the variety and interaction of many of them is good.

The game still takes longer than I like, and does inspire AP in others. Fortunately placements are interleaved.

The theme is depicted very well, despite a couple of anti-thematic elements (the worker placement, family growth) that are critical to it functioning as a game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Update: after probably 40 plays, I don't really get excited about the cards anymore.  Initially I felt like each hand of cards was like getting a completely new set of possible strategies.  Now I feel like there are only a few strategies and the cards give you some options for pursuing those strategies.  Without the excitement of trying new things, the core game is a little bit not my style.  

It's also funny to note that when I first started playing this game, I felt like I was building something.  Now, I feel like I see what is possible from the beginning, and the game is just tearing it down.  It's seems like the game is too opaque in some areas and too clear in others.  Still, I can't really recommend the game enough.  I certainly got a ton of value out of it and I'll continue to play it here and there down the line.


(original rating)Just a fantastic game altogether.  It hangs with any of the other top tier games, but there's two things that elevate this above the rest for me:

1) It's like if Puerto Rico/Caylus/etc. had new buildings every time you played.  With 300 some cards and the cards being so integral to how you approach each game, it's like you get that new game excitement of trying to figure out a strategy every time you play.  Fantastic.

2) Bits do a lot for me, and it's not the look of these that are so great (I mean, it's farming, not an army of ninjas) it's the way you get to actually construct your stables, sow your crops, and see things actually come to life in your farm.  It really immerses you in the game.  Having animeeples and vegimeeples just takes this a step further.

I didn't like this game until we played the full game with the cards you get at the beginning. The puzzle of deciding how to use these cards in the best way is great. And trying to get your plan to work is exciting. 

The base game is a solid worker placement, but pretty boring. Building your farm without any special powers is a dull affair.

RATING: 8
Note: We love Le Havre and played it before Agricola. 

This is much better for less serious gamers. Very thematic - who doesn't love play farming - and it's much more manageable scope and length. The limitations make it such that nobody can pull too much ahead, which can keep it semi-competitive for less experienced gamers. 

Still,the scoring cap is very frustrating and limiting. It really doesn't allow a whole lot of room for specialization because you need at least a little of everything, but having a lot of something only gets you so far. 

My complaint is that the game feels a little too short/incomplete - it doesn't feel like it's quite ready to be over when it ends. I would say it's very dissatisfying. 

Still, I'm looking forward to teaching the family game to some lighter gaming friends and see their response to this game. I have a good feeling about this.

Too unforgiving game for my taste. A game that requires you to do everything : not breeding AND not farming AND starve your family AND you won't win any game.

At the end, i prefer to play Le Havre as loans and interest give you much more latitude to carry out your strategy (you can starve your workers to do something else much more lucrative).

Perhaps "Farmers of the moor" will change my point of view.

I've played this a couple of times and find it a dull grind.  Do you enjoy the feeling of not being able to do what you want in the short term and sacrificing long term goals to subsist?  If so this might be the game for you!  Maybe medieval farming was really tough, and making hard decisions can be compelling, but the play time here is far too long for what I get out of it, and everyone is so focused on their own mini-board with no direct interaction between players that it generates very little atmosphere around the table. Not likely to play again.

[floatright][size=5]2012-12-05[/size][/floatright][b]Solitaire[/b]
The no-cards ([i]family game[/i]) single player is a good environment to learn the mechanics and provides an interesting puzzle; if you like playing solo, the variable phase bonuses allow you to learn a lot without the solitaire feeling too repetitive. Even when you have figured out some of the best scoring strategies and the opening has become monotonous, the variable phases will often throw you a curveball and force you to adapt and change your strategy accordingly, making the last 3 harvests more interesting and challenging. Another challenging aspect of playing solo is the increased upkeep of the farmers, who need 3 food each harvest instead of 2, putting a lot of pressure on the player especially during the late, shorter harvests.

When you feel like you're done with this version, you can move on and introduce the cards, which should give the solo variant a much longer life. The first game will probably take more than an hour, but after making yourself more comfortable with the game you'll be able to consistently play in less than 60 minutes (setup time might not be included, depends on your tendency to go into analysis paralysis).

[floatright][size=5]2015-01-14[/size][/floatright]What I like most about Agricola is probably the struggling, the increasing pressure given by the shorter and shorter intervals between harvests, the fact that, even though you are creating an engine, you'll still have to overcome the same problems. Often, in this kind of games, your growing curve transforms the huge hurdles you face at the beginning in little bumps you barely notice. Not so in Agricola.

This is a good game, but I am a little uncertain whether it will have lasting appeal.  There are so many games that already have a broadly similar play structure for me to get too excited over this one; action selection, resource management and building in the mix has been done so many times before and IMO in many better ways.  This game could grow on me a bit more; the replayability factor is great with the different decks of cards and it is beautiful to behold but I doubt it is ever going to fill the shoes of such greats as Keythedral or Caylus.  Good, but by no means great.

The possiblities and strategic planning required to win this game are immense. As you play with different people you run into several different strategies. I prefer Le Havre over Agricola for two player game as it can at least provide a contest rather than a slaughter. Though I have run into some tight games using occupations were both sides only used a third of their available farm yard.

My boardgame buddies say it's right up there with Caylus and Puerto Rico. I don't think THAT highly of it but it's for sure the best new game I played in 2007. ONE thing is definetely better than in Caylus and PR: due to the huge variety of cards each player receives at the beginning of each game (14 out of several 100s!!!) the strategic choices are MUCH more diverse than the ones you can possibly use with the other 2 games. 

July 2008: after about 100 games (mostly 2 or 3, some 4 player games) I herewith declare that it has officially climbed to No.1 on my Top 10 List. This is the game that brought my girlfriend into regular boardgame playing. FINALLY. THANK GOD :-) 

June 2009: I figure that I've played about 250 games so far. Still my favorite and still different almost every time.  Just WOW

June 2012: dunno how many 100s of games I've played by now. I cannot see that this will ever be kicked from it's 1st rank in my personal All-time-favorite game list. Never before has a game intreaged me over such a long time period  (and it still does!) and I guess i can even say that this is the only game that actually affected my personal life as it finally brought my girl friend into boardgaming.

This game really intrigues me.  I think the idea that it is customizable based on number of players and their experience level is great.  The components are of a good quality, though I would have liked to see something a little less abstract than tokens and blocks for the resources.  I suppose that would have driven the price from high to ridiculous though, so I am content to slowly make Sculpey bits.

The gameplay itself is intuitive thanks to the theme (well, sort of) and rewarding in a zen sort of way.  It is great fun to build your little farm and watch it prosper.  It lasts a good while without being too long, but so far just about every time we've played it, people have said "I would play again, but it is too late now."  That is probably more a commentary on my poor choice of starting times than anything else.

My only complaints would be the set-up and the constant shortage of Wood tokens, but I can't see how you would speed things up too much.  The game is enjoyable enough that the setup headaches aren't too bad.  I imagine if you played with an experienced group who could help with setup, things would go much more smoothly, but I haven't had that luxury yet.

Très Immersif malgrès le thème médiocre. 

Ressources assymetriques, et stratégies très variées. Toutes les parties sont interessantes et assez variées par effet papillon. Ca snowball un peu. 

Obligation de drafter tellement les cartes sont déséquilibrées; très orienté cartes du coup. 

Un peu plat à deux..

L'aspect stratégique (un plan de nouriture / un entassement sans logique des ressources) prévaut plutot sur les cartes et l'oportunisme.

Um excelente jogo de locação de trabalhadores. Uma crítica é que as cartas iniciais definem como cada jogador deve se comportar, isso pode "ajudar" muito ou "prejudicar" muito os jogadores, mas ainda assim é um jogo que você jogar e fica com vontade de jogar mais.

Awesome game that I think everyone should have in their collection. It feels like THE basic worker placement game. The theme really comes through and I enjoy trying to get as many sheep and cows as possible. I understand that some players feel boxed in by having to feed your farmers all the time but this doesn't annoy me. I always play with the cards since I feel an assymetrical starting point is the most fun.

It's pretty hard to fault this game and I'm only reserving the 0.5 in case something even better comes along. As resource management goes - it's perfect! There's virtually no luck (which I like) it's very simple to play and hard to completely mess up early on. Has a family version and is the only board game I've ever played solo.

Almost everything that I don't like about Eurogames or worker placemen games, can be found in this. Huge downtime, having to do everything ultimately, or else... Random cards in the start that you have to plan whole game around of lose... If i want dull misery farming, I want the game done by Phil Eklund, he probably could make it at least properly impactfull and competitive, instead of passive agressive "I pick carrot so you lose one point" "I shall then build fences so you can't!"

RATING: 9
Agricola is a good game, a great one, actually. The problem is it becomes very predictable after having played a few times. I can almost say that it is possible to find a-recipe-for-winning the most games, and if not for the huge variety of cards that the game brings, this game would be somewhat mediocre. The problem is that even with the large number of cards, this "winning key" continues to function. In other words: you can win by following this "recipe" even without using none of this cards.
However, I must admit that I like Agricola. Why? I suppose a mixture of reasons among which are: subject matter, visual design, its basic mechanics, the fact that this is a dynamic and interactive (though not much) and not too long game...
In conclusion: I like Agricola and I realy enjoy playing it, but If I'd have to choose between Agricola and his younger brother (or big brother? I don't know), Le Havre, I'd certainly choose the second one!

2011/06 -EDIT-
Having played it many times since my first rating, I don't see that "winning key" anymore! Agricola is great, deep, very replayable, absolutely nice & fun!

Nagyon nagyra értékelt gamer játék. Nagyon vágytam rá, és még mindig nagyon szeretném megszeretni, de nem annyira tudom. A kártyák által nyújtott kimeríthetetlen változatosság ígérete vonzott nagyon a játékban, de ezt sajnos nem sikerült megtapasztalnom. A mesterségek és kisfejlesztések érzésem szerint alig befolyásolják a játékot, és emiatt kicsit monotonná válik pár játék után. Egyszerűen túl gyenge a kártyák 80%-a. Ezért biztos megköveznek, de szerintem ezek a kártyák nem lettek eléggé kitesztelve. Soknak irreália a követelménye, ahhoz képest, hogy milyen előnyt ad. 
Ezt a csorbát leszámítva jó játék, amivel szívesen játszom néhanapján.

Feels alot like Caylus with a much larger array of actions and some ccg-type elements to it. Defnitely worth playing but as people discover card power-combos the game may become less enjoyable (i.e. oh look you have card X and Y out I have nothing in my hand to match you, game over). Nevertheless the game will be a fun ride along the way to discovering those unbeatable combinations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
In the first game Agricola is pretty overwhelming. There's so many things to do and it isn't at all clear how some actions will influence the outcome when compared to other actions. The perception of "OMG, I have no idea what to do" is then slowly replaced by "OMG, I don't have enough manpower/room/food/resources for what I need to do" during that first game. That pretty much sets the tone for the game: You are constantly under pressure.

The improvements and occupations are simply needed for interplay variability, and some of them just allow you to do the usual stuff a little more efficiently while others open up entirely new avenues of play. It is true, however, that depending on the initial card distribution the playing field can sometimes tilt to one side or another, and while prevailing against overwhelming odds can be a fun endeavour in its own right it is not usually what I am looking for in a boardgame. Then again, in the grand scheme of things this is only a tiny cloud in the great blue sky.

I'm still not sure if I like my rating for this game. I don't really know if I want to raise it because the game is so well designed or lower it because it can be reminiscent of actual work. I think that when I am playing with the right people, it can be a 9, but if I am playing with people that just aren't getting in to it, it goes down to an 8. I really like the game, but I have yet to fall in love with it so hard that I feel the need to make clay meeples.

RATING: 8.5
A well balanced and rewarding empire builder, where 'empire' is actually just your little medieval farmstead. This game is fun, but I tend not to agree it is the greatest ever, as the BGG game ranking seems to suggest. 

I think it suffers from too little interaction between players. The only thing players can do to each other is use an action first, but that still usually doesn't effect another player in any serious way. I strongly believe there needs to be some system of player trading, or auctioning, or some other form of interaction between the folks you're playing against.

Even in a 5 player game, it often feels like the players are competing against the scorecard and not the other people sitting around the table.

PRO - Easy to pick up after the first game.  For a Euro, the theme works very well.  Each action you take really does seem to contribute to the success of your farmstead.  The game is engaging, approachable, and fun to play.  Play time is good too.

CON - Only fault I find is the amount of cards dealt to each player at the start of the game (14) is a bit much.  There's a little too much to mull over when combined with the other choices presented by the board, the pressure of feeding your family each harvest and the limited set of rounds.

One of my wife's favorite games, but it's a bit too long for my tastes. The game is based off of three mechanics:
1. Worker placement
2. Resource gathering
3. Building/upgrading

There are other worker placement games I'd rather play, and better resource gathering games as well. However Agricola does the building/upgrading well.

In all, I probably wouldn't turn down a game, but the set up time and the long play time means it doesn't hit the table very often.

Agricola is a game we play often, each time with a different outcome.

Basically you play a farmer. You start of with a couple of acres of land and a house. You job is to use your land to provide for your family and in the meanwhile both expand your family and house.

The luck factor does play a (small) role with this game. In the beginning of the game you're dealt cards at random. Your strategy will have to be based upon these cards. In my opinion this feature is what keeps the game 'fresh'. Every game is different.

just some comments about usual complainments:

1) 'Agricola is multiplayer solitaire': yes the interaction-factor is not very high in this game. You can compare it with caylus - the whole interaction is in blocking the actions you use for others. But that is important you always should watch your opponents what they will do next and make sure you are startplayer in the right moment... (also there are some cards which give you some kind of interaction).

2) 'Agricola is to luckdriven, if you get the wrong cards you have no chance': yes there are cards which are stronger than others, and there are combos of cards which are extremley powerful. BUT: each card costs you an action ressources, the time you need to get out your three-card-combo I can use to get important ressources or build up my hut and get another child. I think in most cases it balances out well. If you don't believe in it you can decrease the luck by either the official variant (you can always discard 3 handcards to draw 1 new card) or some selfmade variant (instead of 7 cards you get 10 cards but you have to discard 3 of them before game starts)

3) 'You are played by your cards': yes your cards give you a direction where to go - but usual you still have at least 2 strategies which you can improve with cards. Also it is not everytime clear which is the best move in any situation - the cards give you some hints for the strategy but you still have to choose all the tactics.

4) 'Agricola is hyped': So what! It IS a good game and it would in no way different if no one had mentioned it anywhere - but now you have the chance to recognize it so give it a try!

If you love Caylus you must try Agricola - if you neither love nor hate Caylus still give agricola a chance - if you hate Caylus you should avoid agricola.

I liked this a lot more than I thought, but I went in with very low expectations.  All the moving parts work well together.  Farming as a theme is just as boring as it seemed when I started, but at least it's a relatively unused boring theme instead of just doing something to impress some medieval or renaissance big-wig.  With a more captivating theme, I'd probably say an 8 or 9.

It's a game about farming. It's a theme that I have almost no interest in, but I can see the attraction. It's resource conversion and it's using limited actions efficiently yet still having room left to maintain/feed your resources. It is interesting and engaging and there is quite a rewarding feeling for getting things done in a very limited timeframe. Now with all that said, this is still a game about farming. :)

In an attempt to "retrograde" my collection I traded away Agricola. As a result I haven't played it for quite some time and have attempted to try other worker-placement games in the intervening time to see if I could find something that I liked better. I did not. Agricola is strong and tough to beat and one of these days I'll grab it again and enjoy it all over again (as I've likely forgotten the cards we've played).

I could play this game many dozens of times and probably never see the same set of cards.  Of all of the thematic games I've played this is probably the closest to a lifetime game.

On the one hand, the mechanisms work well in this grand-daddy of worker placement games and the theme comes out way more than some people give it credit for. On the other hand the constant feeling of hardship (thematic, I know) and especially the weird scoring system where you need to have some of everything instead of being able to specialize, suck a lot of the fun right back out for me.

The decks of cards for infinite replayability: Genius.

It takes too long to play, and there's not enough player interaction, but Uwe Rosenberg has created such a nice farming aesthetic in this game that it wins me over.  The occupation and minor improvement cards really add a lot of diversity to the game.  There is always one card that will dramatically alter your strategy, but the game is just perfectly timed so that you will never fully realize that strategy.  About the time your strategy is kicking in, the game ends.  This is a little frustrating, but on the other hand, I sort of like that the game is brutal in this way.  There's also so little player interaction that you can chat with other players when it's not your turn, get up to get a cup of coffee, watch TV, or any other sort of thing.  This gives the game a relaxed feeling; you want to set aside a Sunday afternoon for this one and just take it slow and enjoy it.  The other wonderful thing about this game is that there is a solitaire version, a 2 player version, and a multi-player version so it's like 3 games in one!  It probably does not deserve to be the #1 game on geek, but it's a good game, and certainly fun to play!

RATING: 3
Overrated game. For me, it just seem that rules have been added time and time again during development to make up for the lack of original ideas. Feels too much like Magic on this aspect. 

It's only redeeming feature is that you can play sub-optimaly, and even screw up your game, trying to have some solitary fun (if only...) without impairing the other player's experience.

RATING: N/A
I have only played it once, and I don't think I am familiar enough with the game to give it a rating.

I've actually enjoyed it. There is of course not much interaction and I felt that the game does not really allow too much creativity for the players. But I was still really engaged in it. Only after finishing it did I question, why it sucked me in. Then I've realized that for me this game was the board game equivalent of online farming games. It's super addictive, and it's actually enjoyable to watch your little empire grow, but in the end there is nothing cool about it. Also, the social part felt as if I were at a party where everyone is only playing with their phones.

This is just a very subjective opinion of a newcomer, but at this point I am not really motivated to ever play again.

RATING: 2
The worker placement works fairly well early, limiting resources with players fighting and choking each other, but the pace of the game eventually overloads the board with spaces, resulting in that supposedly key blocking becoming impossible.

The way the game incentivizes collecting some of everything results in a samey experience each play. Hands of cards theoretically change the game, but their random nature results in sets that are sometimes synergistic and sometimes not which makes the game seem to favor players with good draws. Drafting or discarding can only help so much when the cards are so unbalanced.

RATING: 10
A very entertaining game, and fun for everyone who is introduced to it.  This game gets a ten because it is so versatile.  The family version is a great way to introduce new serious players to the game and also is great for literally just playing with the family, non-gamers who will find the animeeples cute but would not normally play a modern board game.

The full version however is where this game really shines!  The occupations and minor improvements ensure that no two plays are exactly the same.  This leads to a great deal of variability, but back to the versatility argument this game works great with one player and scales exceptionally well all the way up to five players.  I'd have to say that Agricola is my favorite solo game, and my favorite two player game.  Hence the high rating.

RATING: 8
No bandwagon - It's just one of the best in my collection. I waited until I played 9 games before rating it. I intended to wait until I played 10, but after the 9th I was positive. 

However, after 28 plays I have downgraded it a bit. I keep it as a 9 only because I know it is a good game, but  the cards ruin it for me (obviously, not for others). So, when I do play (not so often now) I play without the cards.

[The following is what I wrote after 9 plays: "Still think it is a good game, but not nearly as good as I thought it was when I wrote the below:
As for bandwagons, I was not taken with Puerto Rico or Caylus. I bought them both, couldn't wait to play after all the hype. Was sure they would be among my all-time favorites. While I recognize both as excellent games, deserving of top status, neither kept me fascinated past 3-4 games. At that point I lost interest in both. But Agricola is different. I am even MORE fascinated with it after the 9th playing than I was after the 1st, or 5th, or 8th. It has grown on me with each playing - and I have not begun to tap the depths of it due to the built in "expansions" that come with the game.. Solitaire, a Base game (family), expansions, and playable up to 5 people."]

I admire it being so thematic for a Euro.  I like the cards.  The farm you build is visually appealing.  However you spend the whole game feeding your family and trying to do "just a bit of everything".  By the time you have some sort of engine and want to do some of the cool stuff, the game ends.  Dislike that part quite a bit.

Played the family rules once, loved it. This is one deep game, but it all flows together very thematically.

Most thematic game I've played. (What you do matches theme of farming closely).

I acknowledge this is a clever clever game; I would enjoy playing it on certain occasions, but would not actively request it. Disclaimer is that I am yet to play it with the cards (shock horror). UPDATE: Need to get back to this, but its a good but long and intense game (Rating 7.954, Jan 17).  UPDATE I think I forgot how good this game of angst is.  Now having played it with cards, it really needs a better rating (9.421 Jan 17). UPDATE With the cards and as 4 players, a truly angst filled and intense game.  Brilliant (Rating 9.821, Feb 17)

Yeah, I don't know. Only played once so I guess it's not fair to dismiss it yet, but it felt like too much of a multiplayer solitaire really. I know it's not really the case, and everything you do impacts everyone else, but it's still not the same as direct interaction. The German version didn't make it easier as it took us all some time to find our cards on the reference sheets which slowed the thing down quite a bit. I just feel I have better ones to use my precious game time on.

Starting with Le Havre first, I really enjoy the game system that Rosenberg has developed.  Agricola is Uwe's classic game that feels very much like his signature design (i.e., collecting resources, using them to purchase abilities, feeding phases, harvests, etc.) The theme in Agric is more integrated to the mechanics than Le Havre. Le Havre, however, is still less to keep track of and a more fluid game experience. Regardless, Agric is a game that offers something different from Le Havre, and the balance and theme and sheer replayability keeps this one in high regard.  A seriously brilliant game that deserves its high praise. It has everything I love about Le Havre, but a stronger theme-to-mechanic integration and richer game immersion.  Solo has a very fluid feel to it - much more so than a 4-player games which feels tight and panicky!  However, I really enjoy both experiences for what they bring to the table.

I like the game very much but sometimes I just feel like I'm actually working the whole time and it is exhausting... But in a good way. May hurt your brain a little and you may be concerned about the well being of your family in the game but that tension is nice. It has a lot of variety since it has like 500 different cards that will give you a different hand every time you play and your strategy will depend greatly on those cards dealt to you at the beginning of the game.

This is the king of worker placement games.  The decisions are tight, the replay value is high (thanks to the 300+ cards), and the time to weight ratio is spot on.

This was my top worker-placement / resource-processing game until Le Havre dethroned it awhile later.

The iOS version has now rejuvenated this game for me. I get to play it more often, which has opened my eyes to how strategically different the 2, 3, 4, and 5 player versions are.

I prefer 2-player which is very interactive and competitive, even with just the E deck.

I'm enjoying Uwe's style of games less as time goes on, especially as his designs have become more expansive and less tight. Agricola represents the best of his design philosophy for my tastes. Taking an action is denying your opponent and, unlike many euros, there is unlikely to be a suitable substitute on the board. Though not a direct layer of interaction, this aspect still creates a tense experience where your opponents moves feel impactful. I will never trade in that feeling for the more open experience.

Tight, tense and fun, struggling to feed your family has never been so good. Still one of the greats.

Hungry families are a$$holes.

With Animeeples.
And Resourceeples (from Quarashi)

Played twice 2P with my wife and lost both games.  The second game was closer than I expected, and is the reason for me deciding with an 8 rating and not higher.  She had a pair of occupation cards that automatically gave her clay and wood nearly every round and I just couldn't keep up.  Once you're in that hole it's hard to recover.

Update:  Came in 2nd in a 3P game a liked it a lot more.  I'm only slightly better at the game, but it makes more sense each time I play.

This deserves its high position in the rankings.  There are so many different directions that you can take your family, independent of the fact that, like everyone else, you're trying to ensure that everyone in your family gets fed and that you utilize every space in your farm.  One thing to always remember is that you need multiple strategies, especially as the number of players increases.  Much of the time you won't get the action you were most counting on, so you need to have Plans Two, Three, and sometimes Four in mind.  Make sure you know all the food-acquiring vectors; you have more options than just cooking, baking bread, and picking food up from actions on the board.

For me, Agricola is the definition of a Euro game. It is all about worker placement, efficiency and passive-aggressive player interaction. I like some of the game components like the animals, but I regret the family members, resource and vegs are just wooden discs - I would have liked meeples and smaller ones for babies. I am not a fan of the veg and resource tokens available outside the game, they are just not as cute as the animals.
Also, I regret that the only player interaction is by blocking access to resources. It is almost like you wished the other player wasn't there. I think there is a missed opportunity for negotiation or any elegant player interaction, like group investments, synergies between players'actions (i.e. Terra Mystica), etc
I really like that the game feels tense and I always get that impression that I could break the game and stay on top of things. But I always end up not being able to do all I wanted to do.
The game feels different each time thanks to the occupation and minor improvement cards. It is also very simple to teach and play but hard to master. But because chance barely plays a role, expect experienced players to beat newbies.
Certainly one of the games my wife and I play the most.

A worker placement game with an agricultural theme. Players have to maintain a farm and feed their family. Different settings for 1,3,4 or 5 players is brilliant. The addition of cards in the game makes the game simply ingenious. Each game feels and plays differently. Unlike most euros, the theme matches the game perfectly. Agricola totally deserves its ranking and in my opinion is simply the best game ever made.

Great complexity and depth of play. Lots of decision points where you have to evaluate what you need tactically (immediately) and what you want strategically, as well as evaluating your opponents to attempt to determine what they need/want as well. 

Its theme is surprisingly appealing; I've seen even non-strategy-gamers enjoy playing (she ran an organic farm to reflect her vegetarian sensibilities). However in general, the length and complexity are a barrier to getting people to play.

RATING: 8
My main complaint about the game is that all farms tend to look like each other.  Everyone has to get veggies, sheep, pigs, cows, and expand their house / family growth; the penalty for not doing so is too much.  Of course, this competing for the same resources and the worker placement mechanism is what drives the game.  That said, it's still a good game.

Also, as a solitaire gamer, I do like that it comes with a solitaire game in the same box.  The solitaire game is more of an optimization problem (compared to the regular game, which has a strongly antagonistic environment), so it is a different game.

Sweet mother of God...there are a lot of options each round, and it only gets more and more complicated.  Much tougher to learn and play than Puerto Rico (making the comparison because both are highly ranked).  

Much better the second time around without using ALL of the cards.  

Good as a two-player game.  Better with more, but even with only two, choices are still tough but in a different way.  With more players, it's a question of, "What should I choose based on what others need too?", but with just two players, it's, "What should I choose even though there are so many things I need to do?"  Having less competition for choices doesn't make the game easier.

Sold my copy, as I much prefer Loyang.  I'm definitely in the minority there!

For a game to be interesting, the theme has to pull you in. Personally, there is absolutely nothing about this game's theme that I find compelling. Farming? Really? Some folks get a bit too excited over constructing little fences & putting animals in pens- Yay! Just tedium, tedium... Because of this, Agricola feels like it takes forever. Way too much hype over this game. However, Agricola is a wonderful cure for insomnia.

Seems very good. There are many choices and possible strategies. The rating will probably go up. This game is a lot like Caylus.

I really enjoy the worker placement mechanic.

What I don't enjoy about this game is tension. It's a bit too tense for me. I feel I don't have enough time execute my plan.

It is an interesting game.  I find all of the mechanics and moving parts (actions, harvest, crops, animals, major/minor improvements, occupations, resources, etc.) to be pretty daunting for the first game.  I managed to avoid having to beg, but it was close. :-)  The second game I prioritized expanding my house and family and was much more satisfied with the gameplay.  I also find that the available improvements and occupations can be very limiting.  I really wish there was some sort of draw mechanism if you don't like the cards you are dealt.

I am sure the game is as great as everyone says, but I feel way too stressed while playing it. My family starving because some smartass took the food I was planning to harvest is more than I can bear. Then I have to sacrifice the sheep I was lovingly raising because the family must eat something and it is like, tragedy. And I am virtually forced to have sons to keep my farm competitive with my neighbors?? Are you kidding me? What kind of childhood am I giving to these kids? What if they wanted to go to college instead of working in the farm?

Not a fan of this game. By the time I get a chance to build everything up the game is over. It requires very tight timing and any changes to that timing will screw up your strategy and cost you points unnecessarily. Also, you need to be a jack of all trades and cannot specialize in a goal. Really limits your overall strategy.

RATING: 7
I feel like Agricola is a really great game, however the chances of most of my friends/family being willing to learn such a complicated game is very low. I was able to learn the basics in a single gaming session, however strategy will take many more and experienced players have a huge advantage. I may revise my rating once I've had a chance to play more.

RATING: 7
Popular turn-based resource management game.  After one play I was surprised how complex this game is, even for the average experienced gamer.  Lots of interesting player actions here (i.e. farming, building, eating your furry friends), but down time for each player is prevalent.  Not for the light-hearted gamers in our group, which is why I'm surprised this game is rated in the overall BGG top 5.

RATING: 9
Great worker placement game. Would be a 10 except for the luck of drawing cards for occupations and minor imp. But at the same time this gives the game great replayability and you never seem to play the same game twice. A favorite of our gaming group. It takes a while to play but if your  whole group is into these kind of games it goes by pretty fast. Played over 20 times.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It lives up to the hype.  Lots of tough decisions to make, and a goodly amount of player interaction due to the worker placement mechanism. The random draw of Occupation and Minor Improvement cards will lead to a lot of replay value, as a player's strategies must shift to take full advantage of the set of cards available in each game.

Agricola shares a lot of mechanics with Caylus, but it offers an element of *fun* that Caylus seems to lack.  At this point I'm not sure whether that's a result of the lighthearted theme, or whether it is something else entirely.  I suspect that experienced players will run through a game of Agricola faster than a game of Caylus, which neatly addresses one of the biggest issues I have with the latter.

The five player game is incredibly resource-tight; I prefer four players or fewer.

The "family game" variant (no cards) is a bit boring.

I have not burned out on this one.  My wife has a love-hate relationship with the game.  The "stress" in the game gets to her and she has dificulty staying with her victory plan in the mid game. Certainly this is a game of denial at times.  For a Euro there feels like there is a lot of player conflict.  I have also felt like I was telling a story at times so there is, for me a sense of narative. 

Sure the cards add luck, I don't mind.  Often they are distracting, It adds to the replayability and narative.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is fabulous, immense replayability because of the sheer number of occupations and minor improvements (of which each player only uses 7 each) and then the different mixes and interactions with other peoples picks! Just great, and so many different elements to the game which may seem daunting at first but becomes easy after just one game.  I'm really looking forward to another play, now if I could just track down some animeeples!:)

Played once, lacking a few turns to completion.  If complexity = depth then 'gricola's myriad of cards deliver a challenging, almost daunting game experience.  I would play again but have no desire to own it.  For me, Puerto Rico is still the gold standard of the Euros.  

After a 2nd, complete play in a five-player I've decided that I would rather watch paint dry.  The theme doesn't do anything for me, and while it is a game that has garnered huge support, I have no desire to invest the time necessary to play this game competitively.  It is too long for what it is. This is in the NO FUN ZONE for me.

Played this game a third (and final!) time.  I don't hate any game--hatred should never be wasted on something as ultimately insignificant as a game.  However, if I was capable of hating a game...

I picked up a copy cheap at a thrift store.  I traded it for a copy of Automobile.

Great game, with nice components and a wonderful replay value. The only flaw is, just when you start to do good the game is over, but I probably need a few more plays to figure a better strategy.

Many thanks to the Boardgameswithscott.com video review of this game. I probably wouldn't of bought this game, until I played it or saw a video review of it first. These video reviews are a huge help when deciding on whether to buy a game or not.

It's finally here... and it's HEAVY (as promised). The bits are gorgeous - and the gameplay (so far just solo games) is really interesting. It's got that "just one more game" quality - which would be enhanced if it didn't take up most of the breakfast table to play.

UPDATE: I've played 5 multi-player games & 18 solo games... and it still fascinates me. I think the only negative I can see is the downtime with five. Otherwise, wow. It works with or without the card decks, as well.

First solo and 2 player plays last night.  I have to say, this is likely to become one of mine and my wife's all time favorites.  Having never played it before, learning it from scratch from the manual was a bit of a challenge, but once I had it down, teaching it to my wife was easy.  I think others will pick up on it quickly too.  Has to get a 10.

Update: 2/20/2012
With 5 games finished, I can confirm it as a 10. I think it accomplishes what it sets out to do which is to give the feel of actually being a farmer hundreds of years ago.  I doubt this would be a good "first euro" game for someone, but after they get some of the gateway games under their belts, this will likely become a favorite.  

Also, need to note that we've aslo put in 5 more games with Farmers of the Moor expansion and I think that's totally the way to go.  FotM takes a 10 and makes it an 11.  Get it.

Update: 8/14/2012
20+ games (with FotM) and still it's a 10--my favorite among 30 or so Euro games I've played.

Update: 1/26/2015
Close to 40 games (not all games are recorded here--didn't start recording until much later).  Never disappoints.

As far as worker placement games go, this is garbage.  Antisocial game with boring theme and one strategy to win.  If you don't know that one strategy you're SoL.  Publisher used cheap pieces, and changed colors after printing rules making wood and clay colors confusing and backwards from every other game.  Save your money and buy Stone Age or Lords of Waterdeep instead.  *EDIT* Updated my rating from 1 star to 3 stars after learning that the game has been revised 7 times, fixing some of the issues I have with the original version.

Great game, I like it better than Puerto Rico because I've found it easier for people (including myself) to get into compare to PR, because of the theme, it just makes more sense to upgrade a farm for some reason.  Lots of strategies & the cards add that random element to make every game different.  Even though I am more of a war gamer, I don't mind picking this up once in awhile.  Not as fun solo, just seem a little pointless solo to me, but does let you try out strategy ideas though.  The only thing I don't like is when playing with lots of people, it does bog down a bit.

Oh, man... After moving of zylions of these tiny little wooden pieces every turn you start to hate eurogames. It is rich. It is different every time. And it is a gamers' game. It certainly deserves to be in top ten but definitely doesn't deserve to be in top three of all games ever. The gameplay is simply too tedious. I appreciate the complexity of the game and the variety of strategies. It simply is not elegant in terms of gameplay.

Agricola is a fine design, but somewhat too long for what it is. Also, the scoring is distractingly counter-intuitive to me: the game tries to force me to do things in ways that don't appeal to me or do not seem to make any sense, except point-wise, so I end up having to choose between doing interesting things and things that are worth points and that's something I never enjoy.

While I can certainly see at least part of why this is so highly regarded, this isn't my cup of tea - if only because I don't seem to be very good at worker placement games. It is better than Caylus, at least.
It's also too (physically) heavy for me to ever consider buying, given that I very rarely get to play games at home, and use public transport when travelling.

RATING: 5
Only one play, but that's enough to convince me there's substance behind the hype. 

Update: Bumped up rating a half point. Even more enamored after a couple more plays. Delicious, farm-fresh turn angst with death constantly at your doorstep. The hardship of living paycheck to paycheck transformed into tense, harrowing, gaming fun.

Update: Not quite as enamored as I once was. Lowered half a point.

Update: Now the randomness of initial card draws is starting to bother me. If this played out as quickly as a straight card game, such variance wouldn't be an issue. But at 2-3 hours for a single hand of cards with four players, it can be vexing. Also vexing is the seating order dependence. Yes, one can always choose Start Player. But one cannot choose a motivated right-hand player who will occasionally choose Start Player. Or choose a left-hand player who is not hell bent on choosing Start Player at every opportunity.

Update: The tedious, plodding pace of this game makes me more and more reluctant to sit down and play it. In fact, this is another 2- or 3-player only game for me.

I can't imagine wanting to play this ever again. Perhaps decades from now, when nostalgia exceeds aversion.

RATING: 8
Excellent game - difficult to learn with the interacting paths to victory points, and the necessity of getting your food engine running.  Huge replayability with all the cards - overwhelming at first.  Most impressive, and the attention to detail in theming the cards is superb.  And the solo series works really well.

The more I play the better it gets - rating moved to 9. Not sure about 5p - bit slow and seemingly random interaction makes it difficult to plan.  More plays may address this.  3 or 4p my current sweet spot.  But plays well 2p, and solo works fine. playing a lot - but the way that option close down still irritates me a little - I prefer the opening up of Le Havre to the frustrations and tightness of the standard Agricola last 3 turns

I have played a few games now and still look forward to playing again. I have taught it to enthusiasts and casual gamers. Once players get over the initial feeling of information overload they get into it. An absorbing game in which you have to make the best of what you get and players seems to enjoy the experience even if they don't win. Play time has clocked in consistently at 30 minutes per player, even with new players.

I have an oven, and you have an oven, but you are on the Bake Bread "space", and that somehow prevents me from baking with MY oven?!

I so very much wanted to like this game.  Farming theme?  Terrific!  Limited resources?  Great!  But illogical constraints on when I can use those resources ruins it.

Also, the scoring is such that there are not really different strategies to pursue.  You need to be decent in almost every aspect and great in a couple. Specialization is not an option.

With some tweaks, I'd probably enjoy it, but I'll just play its superior sibling, Le Havre, instead.

Rated well for a reason, thus far this is the king of its particular worker placement genre.  It provides a big enough decision space without just overwhelming you with 10,000 options.  Requires some creativity to maximize the hand you have.  Still doesn't make me want to rush out and buy a whole bunch of other worker placement games.

But man, the turn to turn upkeep in this game annoys me.  It's excrutiating and makes you want to just play the iOS version.  Fields of Arle does it better in this respect.

Not a game for everybody and yes the buzz has been deafening at times (along with the anti-buzz buzz).  Just the same, this is a solid games that has nice variety to it with the sheer amount of cards.  It's a balancing act to play this game well and you have to keep on your toes in regards to feeding your family while at the same time expanding and making improvements to your farm.  The theme isn't exciting for many since it lacks trolls, but I am perfectly ok with it.

I really groove on having to manage your cards for each game so I really see no point to the family version unless you really are playing with non-gamers.  The cards add variety and room for good play.

Animeeples rock and I am forever better than anyone who doesn't own them and only the original animeeples count towards one's coolness factor.  :)

Love the game, but the only game I own, where an opponent actually acted like a jerk to me... and in front of my children.  I will need to play this again soon so that the memory of that incident can be quickly forgotten.

This game has two main attractions.
1) The concept of building your own farm. (Appeals to the solitaire player)
2) The tension of the limited choices you have to do that. Feeding your family is tough, as well as blocking someone else from making a necessary move.

I don't like the whole "farm" theme...but I like this game.

Great Game, easy to learn, tricky to play.  I have to say the optional cards seem to all very little to the game.  We have played with a couple of the decks, but I'm not sure I see the appeal.   

The beginners game is a excellent way to get players into the game, then bring on the standard game.  

I went all out and bought the various meeples, adds a lot to the look of the game.

A fine worker placement game with a strong farming theme.  For those considering purchase of the base game and expansions at the same time I would note that I have tried almost all the variants and though they add variety I think the base game to be sufficient as is.  Adding all the variants seems to "clutter" the experience without really adding anything of unique value to the game.

I love games where you build stuff, but there's something about the worker placement mechanic that irks me about this game. "My neighbour is having kids so now I can't have any?
Guess I'd go to the pond to collect some reeds if my other neighbour wasn't there already, hogging all the reeds..."
I think Merkator is the best Rosenberg title yet.

Definitely more fun that it has any right to be, the amount of variety among the cards is fantastic, however they are so incredibly subtle compared to the differences in buildings in Le Havre or Ora et Labora.  I think it is probably number 3 for me behind those other two games simply because I really get stressed out playing it, trying to figure out the optimal move.  I'm sure with more plays it will get easier to figure out, but right now I really have a hard time playing it even at a reasonable pace.

Components and artwork are fun, and a major part of the game.  Many compare this with Le Havre, but I feel they're both very different games.  In Le Havre you're constantly reaching for the next great opportunity, in Agricola you're constantly avoiding disaster.  The shorter game/family game is also very excellent, don't avoid it just because it's called the "family game".

Despite the theme, frankly quite bland, the game shines in its simple mechanism allowing for infinite strategy. However, such a rich idea is ruined (partially) by the cards, which are different for each player and randomly dealt, thus ruining the illusion of absolute balance (which I treasure in Euro games, otherwise I rather play my beloved AT) and most importantly forcing or influencing your strategy. 
Still a fun game, just not the absolute wonder it could have been (provided it was also themed decently).

[b]Agricola[/b] [i]Uwe Rosemberg 2007[/i] 
Agricola includes more than 300 cards in its box and has a superb expansion ("Farmers of the Moore") that improves the core game turning it into an excellent gamers game. Using FIMO bits the game looks really beautiful on the table and reachable for non gamers when playing the family version. The game mechanics are also great and its scalability is excellent from one to five players. Agricola basic game is not the most replayable game in the market in terms of winning paths, but its expansion solves this problem adding many new ways to the victory as well as new problems to solve in order to build a nice (and winning) farm. The expansion is excellent and improves its rating from an eight to a very deserved nine.

One of the best of Uwe! Great game!

Some say: 'this game is to hard... You don't have enough time, and it is over when it really starts to pop up'..
But hey, if you don't like that 'Making from noting a small farm' then go play Ora et Labora...
That one is huge! And takes way more time... 
The soul of this game is that feeling that every worker, every single sheep, every action counts..
You can't make a single mistake... And the smallest thing can depend if your going to win or lose..

April 2008 - Light 'theme' and easy to play.  Tons of cards supposedly add tons of variety (I've only played 2 4-player games so far).  My impression is that the game will change a fair bit based on number of players, which is a good thing.  I'm interested to see others 'plays-best-with' opinions.  Is it good.  Quite.  Opening at 8/10.  I found myself mulling over my 'mistakes' which is a good sign.  Despite the limited 'number' of actions the choices are gruelling and many options are open.  Cards suggest it may have great longevity, time will tell.
Oct 09 - 20 plays, and first with the "I" deck.  It was fantastic.  Increasing my rating to 9/10.

RATING: 6.5
It's a very well made game and I can really see why people love it so much, but it's not for me. I would even say that it's aged surprisingly well, it was very innovative for its time, I just don't have that much fun when I'm playing it. The game is basically 16 rounds of doing incremental things that don't feel very rewarding. I guess it's thematically appropriate, but I don't enjoy barely scraping enough food together every round to keep my family from starving. In most games like this you can look down at what you've created after the game is finished and feel a sense of accomplishment. When I looked down after my 1 play of this I saw empty fields and pastures and a cow standing in my living room, pooping on my fancy stove. Sure, I had my very own outhouse and a clay deposit, but I didn't feel accomplished.

I also don't like the cards. I don't like that you're just handed 13 cards from decks of 100+ cards each and simply told to work with what you've got. You have no control over it and it means that certain players will have an advantage. Sure, it's not that bad if your cards don't have synergy because the game punishes you if you don't do EVERYTHING, but it's less fun to build a wide and shallow engine and some cards are just better than others.

I like the worker placement spots. I like that they come out in a slightly different order every game (though it can be frustrating) and that resources stay on some cards, incentivizing unused spots. I also like the balance that more family members give you more actions, but also need to be fed (though it's handled better in more modern games such as Tzolk'in, this was the game to invent the mechanism) but I don't like how they give you a LOT of points so you always want to grow your family even if you're struggling for food, it's always worth it. I like the interaction and how much competition there is for a lot of the spots on the board, it's rare to me that the first player market moves almost every round but it does so in this game. 

In summary, it's a great game but this rating is subjective and I would simply rather play other worker placement games most of the time.

I like this game a lot, but what keeps me from loving it is how hard it seems for people to want to play it.  Of course this is going to get compared to Le Havre, which I love as well.  I struggle with this game a little because I've found it hard to find a crowd to play it.  Perhaps this would be different if I had other people that loved to play a 2 hour game where you feel like you are constantly behind the 8-ball, but it seems like a harder sell, and a little intimidating for my group most of the time.

I've enjoyed it every time I've played, but I really think it's a game you need to play a few times before you like it, and that can be a hard investment for a lot of people.

Still, I think it is flawless in terms of mechanics and execution.  I don't mind the struggle at all, and what most people seem to not like about it - the feeling that the game is beating you up, is actually a positive for me.  I like that it is hard, which this game definitely is.

I bought Agricola about two years ago when my husband and I were baby gamers. Although we were predisposed to love the game because we aspire to a real agrarian life, we couldn't get past reading the rules and playing half of a game. We were overwhelmed by the number of choices and couldn't see how to proceed. 

Now that we've played several easier games, we tackled Agricola again and discovered an absolutely terrific game.  I totally understand and agree with the hype about it. We are rating it as a 9. 

And now I have to cut these comments short, because the man is hounding me to go play another game of Agricola!

The pinnacle of the nearly-luckless strategy games. Worker placement perfection.

A worker placement game where the focus is to be able to feed your growing family while improving your farm.
The theme alone will convince you on this game. Just don't play it without the farm animals (also called animeeples).

For a "gateway" it is a little bit more complex than usual but the rules allow playing simpler games to get used to it.

A good game, though I have a sneaking suspicion (granted, purely on one play) that initial hand of cards dealt may play a huge role in outcome of the game.  The more synergistic your hand, the better you'll do.  I also have some minor complaints about a few of the cards (one I had in my hand had rules in the book that didn't align with the text on the card at all), but overall, a good game.

RATING: 8
After several plays, this game quickly became one of our favorites.  My wife and I love the theme, the mechanics, the strategy, the depth, the variety, the replayability.  Excellent excellent game.  

UPDATE: We have played almost 20 games so far. At times it is a struggle and we end the game frustrated and exhausted.  Life on the farm ain't kinda laid back.  At other times it feels like everything is working well.  We're experimenting with the other decks now and trying to figure out the right balance between food engines and pacing family growth / renovations, etc.  There's never enough wood!

UPDATE: Most of the time my wife and I decide we're going to play nice in this game... so instead of taking a worker placement just to screw our opponent, we focus on doing the best we can in the game, against the game itself.  There's a little less negative energy at play because we actively help each other figure out a difficult plan and setup the correct timing.  We don't play 100% open handed, but we also don't go out of our way to screw each other over just to prevent the other person from gaining points.  We hadn't played this game in several months and just recently got it out.  

The first play after such a long hiatus was painful.  We wondered why we ever liked this game in the first place.  "But we've played it 20 times!  No one plays a game 20 times if they didn't enjoy it."  So we scaled it back to just the E and I decks and the 2nd play was better.  3rd play even better and after 4 plays we're back into the swing of things and have added E+I+K decks together for the first time.  

After a few more plays, I'll add FotM in and we'll be givin' 'er all she's got, Captain!

Highest 2P Score so far: 54 (I think... I may have broken 60 at one point but I threw out the score cards)

UPDATE: The threat of starvation in Agricola is a source of stress for us, and the game ends right when we finally get the puzzle solved so we never really get to see our engine running smoothly, which robs us of a little satisfaction.  I'd like to try Caverna before buying to see if the lack of card variety is a dealbreaker despite the removal of the starvation threat.  Rahdo thinks Glass Road is better than this, and it plays faster, so we're going to give that a shot first.

UPDATE: We gave it one last shot, but it gives us agita from the very beginning to the very end.  It feels like work.  Farmers of the Moor didn't fix it for us.  So I'm putting it up for sale.  She had a good run.

(If you don't teach the complete rules before starting, then players learning as they go are strongly disadvantaged) However, the game is complex enough that it is best taught in a "play-as-you-teach" method, but so long you can't really play a learning game as a prelude to a competitive one. I wouldn't call the game easy to master, but getting very good at it is not THAT much harder than just learning to play. 

I don't put a lot of weight on theme, but do find it ironic that the most important technique to master is producing just enough food to feed your family (not wasting effort producing excess of a commodity you don't score points for). Farms exist to export food, so the theme works against the mechanics instead of making a game more accessible.

After several plays and teaching several games I haven't played in, I still haven't seen a balanced deal from the occupation decks. Some combinations are extremely powerful, while a few cards are so weak they are effectively null cards (only worth playing if there aren't any other actions available). I don't mind randomness per-se, although I dislike the outcome of long, meaty games depending on a small number of important random events - in this case the initial deal. This problem affects the E, I, and K decks, but is worst when decks are mixed and amplified by the Z deck (found only in the Z-man games edition). Dealing 10+ cards and discarding down to seven mitigates the problem a little bit, but also increases the play time.

There is also far too much advantage to early players in the first round. The first player starts with one less food, but the people who really get hit are players four and five who have few options, especially for their second action, and they don't get any more food than player 2. Starting resources really need to scale for each player around the table, and one food may not be enough of a penalty for the first player. The first player mechanic in Agricola also introduces a substantial seating order dependence -- sitting to the right of a person fixated on being first or the left of someone who doesn't recognize its importance is a significant disadvantage.

Man, I like this game (I'm a sucker for a farming game) but it is quite hard! Not a bad thing but won't be able to really judge it until it clicks. I would have to say that it feels stressful and like you have to hyper focus (some might classify that as 'feels like work') which I enjoy to most extents, but it's maybe too long for that much high-level stress. In particular, I found it hard in both plays to get my extra workers out (expanding the house) and have to work on this so I can actually have the game click before I say for sure if I like it or not. 

Edit: the more I play other gruel-fest games, I've been growing colder on this. Doesn't do well in comparison to A Feast For Odin for pure worker placement coolness, Trickerion for the competitiveness, or something like Age of Steam for crunchiness.

The stress of feeding in this game is a double edge sword where I really like the tension but feel like it's such a big focus that I can't enjoy the rest of the game's options.

Finally, in May I get my Xmas game from 09.  My wife has had this on back order since something like August last year.  Cracked open the heavy box but haven't had a chance to play it yet.

Played three rounds of this tonight and I am definitely impressed.  Reminds me of a combination of Puerto Rico and Caylus, and that's a good thing.

RATING: 9
One of the best strategic games I have ever played. Like chess with theme, however unlike chess, this game has some slightly different starting positions (cards) and you have to think out your strategy each game, not just play in patterns at the beginning (like in chess). Theme is well involved in this game. This game is not only strategically deep, but also very thematic.

Pros:
+ Interesting and realistic theme,
+ Game is strategic, mentally challenging with very low random chance (minor improvement and occupation cards are dealt randomly),
+ Game mechanics works very well and they are well balanced,
+ Every move and every decision made in game just makes sense - they're all meaningful,
+ Aesthetics are very good, cards and board looks great.

Cons:
- 3-player game is probably too short in resources - very hard to get those, don't know about 5 player game.

P.S.
My solo game record is 61 points.

Personal: probably the only game I explain some kind of strategy (build a cute farm with a bit of everything). Worker placement is one of my favorite mechanics, and you have it here well implemented. Is a good game for casual gamers and good for gamers also (you can include the cards for this). The stress of the feeding phase is one thing I love from this game, you always need some more turns to do what you wanted to do

Yes, yes, YES!  The sadists weep because the masochists have all gone off to play Agricola, and who can blame them - being punched in the face never felt so good.  Simply freaking exhilarating.  You will know that your own special moment in history has arrived the first time you feed your family clay for dinner, because your Farm-Fu is so powerful.  Agricola is the bee's knees and the D's Bs (or perhaps the Wildschwein's Bs?).

Why does Agricola excite me while outwardly similar games like Caylus, The Pillars of the Earth and Leonardo da Vinci do not?  Two reasons.  First and most importantly, Agricola has drama. It hurls you into a burning house and locks the doors from the outside. You're doomed, but the prettiest corpse wins. There is simply not enough time to do what you need to do, so you merely do what you can. Through its sheer brutality, it creates the tension and urgency that I didn't find in other games from its genre. Agricola makes me feel like I'm walking a knife's edge, and what might be a small tactical decision in other games could lead to ruin here. How thematically appropriate, as well!

Secondly, Agricola manages to create a different game experience every time you play, on a level far beyond almost any other so-called Euro. Every game offers a unique set of challenges and opportunities because of your hand of 14 cards, chosen from a set of hundreds. The designer Uwe Rosenberg has taken a page from the Anglo-American school of game design here, adopting the variety, chaos, and rule-breaking powers of games like Cosmic Encounter and Magic: The Gathering. It's a welcome breath of fresh air in a German game market that has been growing a little stale in recent years.

I prefer it to Caverna, even if it is more difficult to obtain your goals and it is more stressing. I like it all has a solo game.

One can use personal easier variants during the first games.

Gifted from Myrriah and Jared on 9/26/08.

Upgraded to a 10 after 3 plays. It's as much fun as El Grande, which used to be my only other 10. For a long time, my family and friends all wanted to play this just as much as I did, so we played nearly every night. I think it's a combination of wanting to win, wanting to beat your personal best score, and wanting to find new ways to combine the cards that keeps us coming back for more. The basic person-placement mechanic reminds me of master builder placement in Pillars of the Earth. And you can never have too much wood.

The theme (farms) might not be appealing but this is in fact a really fun and addictive game.
Once you have finished your first play, you really want to play again and try to make it better.

Takes a while to deploy all the components before starting to play but its well worth it.

There is a lot of ways and strategies to win and every time you play feels different.

There is a significant learning curve that gives a big advantage to the more experienced gamers

This is one of my very best experiences in the boardgaming world. The game puts you in charge of a farm and you gain victory points if your farm has different facilities, if you increase your family or your house.

On a whole, Agricola is worthy of praise.

Really not my cup of tea; too dry without the cards, to much opportunity for interlocking card draws with the cards and too long of a game for what I get out of it either way. If the downtime was less and the total game time reduced my rating would be a 7, but for the investment I prefer Caylus. 

Note for game designers: if a start of game card draw can give an advantage, provide the other players the tools to offset that advantage.

A game that I would need to play 10-12 times before I started feeling comfortable rather than stressed while playing. Just don't know if I'll play that many times (especially with the same people).

Update:
8 years after playing for the first time, I bought a copy. I've become more of a Uwe fan since trying this for the first time. I love Le Havre and Fields of Arle. I still prefer the sandbox feel of those two games, but Agricola has grown on me. As expected, with more familiarity the stress level has dropped. And the occupation and improvement cards offer something great here that his other games do not.

RATING: 7
I don’t think Agricola is very innovative, but is more a feat of good craftsmanship. The mechanics have been seen in other games before and it doesn’t do anything flashy. But the game itself is good and there are many interesting decisions of whether you should go for a big stack or do what you really need to do in time. The game unfolds and strategies and options become clearer as you play. The game plays best with four players, but I also enjoy it with three or five. I prefer to draft occupations and minor improvements.

Ten plays, five times with three, thrice with four and twice with five.

I enjoy the well-implemented theme of this one; I get a kick out of growing my crops and seeing my livestock multiply. The mental exercise of planning for the future and competing for resources is also very engaging. Overall, I think it's an excellent design. The only caveat is that I liked the game better with three than with four; the four-player game can be a lot rougher and if any of the players suffer from analysis paralysis it can bog down pretty badly.

It's also perhaps a hair too involved for my taste.

Holy smokes, this is an amazingly good game. Wonderful information displays, plenty of choices, layered gameplay, outstanding theming, and enough options to ensure lots of replayability (it's like a game and two expansions right out of the box). Interaction is indirect but this isn't a competitive game so much as a shared journey where you get a real sense of satisfaction when you can finally feed your family and set a little aside for the next year (this tipping point is the same kind of "high five" moment as when your railroad is finally in the black in Age of Steam). Maybe I'm caught up in the rush of a new game (in which case my rating will decline), but right now I am inclined to think this is the finest Euro I have ever played. Brilliant game.

Once again a game where you put your workers to do things and get ressources.Rating after two games, one with basic cards used and one with the complex card deck. Rating may go up (but not much) with further plays that include even those interactive cards. Yes there are a lot cards. Other publishers would have offered them as an expansion but here you get them right in the original box. But why is it not a straight 8 or more for me: The progress is pretty slow. Once you know the game it's all about getting get a third worker as quick as possible and so on. The cards you get on your starting hand may get you lucky as they are useful and intelligent to combine or you get a set where only one card makes sense, bad luck as the cards are important. Even the rest of the game is luck independent this bothers me a little, because if all gamers are of equal skill, it's that starting hand that decides which one will be ahead.Yes there are infinite options. But you also have to set up a strategy, making a plan. Once you took that decisicion, you follow over many rounds your plan only interrupted by rare occasions where you react about what others did. Therefore the flow of the game is peaceful and slow. Strange enough those 14 rounds to play seem too short (to fulfill all your plans, but that's intended by the author to increase replayability, to try next time another strategy).You don't get bored during about three hours (five players) but also I wished there was more tension. The only tension is if you can use a certain action before another players uses it (and therefore blocks it for you). You don't care if your neighbour goes for wheat or for sheep (as long you don't have the same plan to grow your ranch). Furthermore I am not that fond of the ergonomy to the action selection boards. So all in all a good game for gamers that like complex games but one could also say that it is a slow progressing multiplayer solitaire. Another downer is "repeated plays"; I very soon got bored from the theme and low player interaction. Another Geek said: "The limited choices each turn lead to scripted play regardless of the variability of the cards."  and I agree. I don't like to be the executor of a strategy initially dealt by the cards in the beginning of the game. After 3 hrs I must say: too long for what it is or where's the game, the interesting decisions?

Deep strategy, not enough time to do everything you want.  Lots of elements to balance - you must feed your family during each harvest, but you also want to diversify your farm as best as possible.  My wife's favorite game, but it's a bit fiddly with all the animeeples, vegimeeples, etc.  I prefer more exciting themes such as sci-fi, but regardless, this is an excellent game.

You play the cards, the cards don't play you!  I always forget this, even when I remind myself constantly throughout the game :p

Daniel bought it as my birthday present - it was back-ordered for the longest time - we ordered it around April or May 2008 and it arrives a couple days before Christmas 2008.  We tried it once and of course I lost cuz I didn't know what I was doing.  Never get to play it again with Daniel, but I've tried a couple solo games (it is a 1-5 people game)

The more I play Agricola the more I love it!  Usually after several plays of a game a player can begin to figure out a winning strategy that they can use over and over again to achieve victory.  I have played close to 50 rounds of Agricola and have yet to find my winning strategy.  One of the other things I love about this game is it ends too soon.  Almost every time I play I find myself wishing I had just one more turn.  Rather than being frustrating, this element keeps me wanting to play again.  I really enjoy this game and hope to pick up some of the expansions in the future.

RATING: 6.5
Truly, a very good game. I believe it is overrated at 8.13 by 38,065 voters at the time I post this, perhaps because it is one of the first games for relatively new board gamers offers:

* deep strategy
* a façade of immense replayability using the occupations cards**
* minimal player-player conflict

For a certain type of gamer, this is heaven because it allows him or her to strategize his next move out of very tough choices but not be bored from game to game because it is too easily solvable AND it allows the player not to be harmed too easily by other players' choices. Yes, placement of a farmer in a location does preclude another player's placement there, but it's usually not profitable to harm another player's chances by spite-placement. The game is just too tight to be playing vengefully, so the incentives are there for everyone to basically play the best game they can.

** Yes, the occupations cards make the game probabilistically replayable beacuse there are so many combinations of cards available. But they do not change the game so drastically to make Agricola too different from game to game. It's almost a game that is replayable by insensible degrees.

Agricola is a great game but slightly overrated.

This game excites me just like Preference. When I play it I do not notice time passing by.

Every farmer likes to have cows, sheep, pigs, to bake, to build stables. I’d say all of the actual farming activities are covered. You also get to feed your family so it is quite realistic. I really like the game but I am not sure if I’ll be able to master it.

Really superb game with lots of variety in starting cards.  Two concerns. It plays differently with different numbers of players.

Second, particularly synergistic starting hands can be devastating for the other players.

As someone else described it: "Many paths to defeat".

Nice farming simulation, many choices, not so many turns. Easily prone to judgement errors which give the victory away. The cards are nice but sometimes unbalanced (better to start with drafting the starting hand), but that's also my main complaint. Too many cards with too many text so it isn't clear unless you're experienced which makes the better choice because it's hard to keep track who benefits the most by taking or not taking certain actions.

The iOS version has rekindled my relationship with this game.  And I really like it!  Tension mounts as you strive to balance developing your holdings, feeding your family and disrupting your opponents. If you just want to potter around aimlessly for an hour or two then Agricola is not for you. Subsistence farming in the Middle Ages was no idle past time and neither is this game!

RATING: 8
Yeah, this is after one play, but I don't think that I'll be back. There's a little *too* much information and too many lines of pursuit that *must* be juggled for me to enjoy. I also didn't enjoy the pressure that the food mechanic brought to bear. I'm okay with being less efficient than another player, but the unforgiving nature of running short on food just didn't appeal to me. This opinion is a little surprising to me, but there it is.

UPDATE: I've played this a couple times and my opinion has improved quite a bit. It was helpful to start with the family version of the rules, which are about the same complexity as (say) Puerto Rico.

UPDATE: having been a beta tester on the iOS app, I had more exposure to this game. And, it's grown on me over time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fully expected to like this more, based on all the hype and high ratings.  With too many players, there just aren't interesting enough choices unless you're one of the first couple in the round.  That's not to say there aren't MANY choices, there are, just that after the 1st couple players, they are about the same level of mediocre.  I was not interested most of the time. 

You spend the first several rounds just trying to survive, not getting what you really wanted, and hoping for better next time.  Long term planning is difficult as you cannot always get what you want.  In these ways, Agricola is just like real life!  :P

 I give the game kudos for being relatively easy to learn.  I also like the scalable difficulty to make it a little more a "family" game also.  I thought the production value to price ratio was on the poor side, with flimsier cardboard than the price warranted, generic cubes and disks, bland art, etc.  This was a game that really needed packed in animal and resource tokens to give the dry theme more personality, especially considering the retail on this.    

I've mostly played larger games.  I am reserving final judgement for 2 player, which I hope to try soon.  I have a sneaky feeling the game might be a bit more interesting, and faster paced, as there should be a good decision to make each turn.  

I hope my rating can increase with 2 player or just with more experience, as the larger games have just seemed to drag and leave fewer interesting options.  I'll update ratings and comments after further exploration of the system.  For the record, I do NOT consider 6 a bad rating.  It fits my "feeling" about how much I want to open and play. 

Update:  Had time for a solo play, finally.  I wasn't expecting to care for it, but I actually did.  It plays differently....in a sort.  You can let supplies build up without competition, so you can long term plan better which felt more satisfying actually.  This lets you grab a large amount when you need it, and build the same turn.  Reducing the wood payout and increasing the food needs went well toward keeping some feeling of pressure on the single player (if you assume that's a good thing), that is otherwise lacking without resource competition from other players.

Still think I prefer Stone Age and Kingsburg + expansion.  Stone Age is a much nicer product with bits, art, and quality of boards.  Yet, it is priced at what definitely feels like a value.  I also like the gambling aspect of SA, where you're "workers" determine dice you roll, not guarantee results.  You can choose to hedge your bets by padding your workforce on a resource or take a risk on variety by scattering your workers.  There always seems to be at least a worthy choice every turn, something that seems to lack from multi-player Agricola.  Overall it just feels less clunky than Agricola, looks much better, and after finishing a game, I'm ready to play again.  I've never wanted to reload another round of Agri after a play, unfortunately.  

With Kingsburg+Exp you place your workers/dice which vary every season.  You still compete with others for placement.  However, even with "bad" rolls, everyone can get something, and more likely than not it is something useful.  I also like the tech tree building up of your town.  It's very similar to the Real Time strategy tech trees.  I never cared much for those type PC games, but this is one aspect of them I DID like.  It's nice to see it thoughtfully implemented into a board game.

After finally getting in a play, I can understand the hype. I'm not sure if I agree with it completely, but it is certainly a good, enjoyable game. An amazing number of options combined with a limited number of actions combine to make each turn thoughtful and often agonizing. It appears to be balanced, but more plays would inform that opinion better. I look forward to a second play, now that each of us has had our "learning game."

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like that every game is different because of the tremendous variability of the cards.  Each time you sit down, you need to look for combinations that make the most of what you're dealt.  That's why my favorite method of drafting is the Rulebook Variant, where you deal 7 cards and get started.  If I draft, I prefer to have a 10-choose-7 draft, so that I can see my entire hand of occs and minors and look for synergies.  Whenever I do a "take one and pass the rest", my goal is to take the most powerful card, not necessarily to look for hidden synergies.

Another very important skill in Agricola is learning when to play cards and when to ignore them.  Sometimes you won't have a great combination, so you have to adjust your play.  It's great fun when I get to the end of the game and realized that I've only played 2-3 cards out of my hand.

This game was one of our go-to game-night games.  The fact that the only luck in the game is in the card distribution at the beginning, really makes this a gamer's game and it's no wonder it's such a highly ranked game on BGG.  I also borrowed the idea of putting tiny googlie-eyes on all the animal cubes from an image I saw in the Agricola gallery and I really like what it adds to the game.  I kinda don't even want the animeeples, though I can imagine the desire to get the goodies expansion will be irresistable, if only for all the new decks.

A tough efficiency game, no doubt.  Not really as fun for me as other worker placement games like Stone Age or even Pillars of the Earth, though there is certainly some more depth to this with the card possibilities.  I don't think I'd be eager to play this again with 4-5, but it's length is okay for 2-3.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in strategy, advance planning, resource / family management, farm / dwelling development, etc. Games take about 45 minutes to an hour with two players, which the game describes 30 minutes per player on average so it's spot on.

It seems to get better the more I play it.  I've been surprised by how well it scales 2-5.  I've also been surprised how easy it's been to teach new players - I think the theme really helps it out in that respect.  A few niggles still sit in the back of my mind: bread-baking seems poor compared to animal-eating, and some cards seem overpowered.  But overall, a marvelous game.

Probably my favorite game.  Worker placement, and a theme that is modeled very well by abstract mechanics.  Small mistakes cost you largely and competition is great, and present in every action.  I only wish my copy came with the Z-deck.

After one play of the family game with my wife I give this a 9. I am itching to play again, and really want to learn the full game with the cards. To be continued...

Update: I have now played this with 5 players once, and with my wife half a dozen times, but only twice with the cards. And I must say that this game makes me feel so stressed! There is just not enough time to accomplish everything. Grrr. But, at the end of the game the score is usually within a few points, and we usually have lengthy discussions about what we could have done differently to win. There is a ton of depth in this game, and I think I will have many, many more plays before this game wears out it's welcome. If ever.

2008-01-24 - ok, so I rode the hype wave and pre-ordered from zman.  well, now I can say screw the hype, I've caught the bug.  got to play at atlanta game fest.  managed to net zero points my first game after picking up a bunch of begging cards as a result of first not understanding a rule, and second simply forgetting to do the bake action.  let my starving agricola family be a sign post for others...FEED YOUR FAMILY!

design influenced by CCGs and caylus/pillars of the earth type mechanics.  the huge number of cards, and multiple levels of difficulty in play (with the E, K, and I decks) really make this a flexible game that should have broad appeal.  Someone had to have playtested the shit out of this game.

The idea of this game was fantastic, it sounded so cool.  After playing several games, the chinks in the armor began to appear.  

- Can't be relevant without being part of the wood rush.  - Luck of the cards can massively influence the game.  
- Forced diversity limits play options
- Seating order relative to players fighting for first player
- Luck of which phase card comes out at which time

I'll probably still play if someone wants me to, I'll probably never request this game.  Maybe if I had been into solo gaming this would have been more fun?

RATING: 3
Possibly interesting as a solo game on an iPad or something, but why would you waste your precious game time on this solitaire drivel? This represents almost everything I dislike in games. A rules-heavy point salad with no compelling player interaction and frequent power imbalance due to the initial card draw. Deal me out.

An ok game.  I don't buy that a LOT of cards makes it a great game though.  And after a few plays I have seen a couple card combos that are way more powerful then they should be.  All cards should be about the same power.

And now that I've played it a couple more times, it's why too experienced based.  In my experience the experienced players expect you to know what cards they are playing from across the table and how they affect the game without actually telling you. 

It ends up taking to long for a worker placement game.

Tough decisions due to scarcity of resources and a finite game length make this an interesting game.  The theme is well done and manages to make farming attractive, even though it is not something I would have sought out.  My 10 year old son loves the animeeples.

After a series of solo plays I am starting to see the charm and the popularity of this game. Some of the thematic flaws grate on me in the multiplayer game (why can't two people bake bread in a turn? Why can't we both have kids? etc....

I understand it makes for a more tight game experience, but it often leads to sub-optimal moves that do not reflect the reality of the theme. So now I'm forced to view it as a puzzle and not a farming in the middle ages...which makes all the artwork superfluous. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Agricola now feels quite dated, and its mechanic show a simplicity which remind us that this was released in 2007! A whole 7-8 years ago. A similar title today, would be more complicated, with more option: just like Caverna.

I love: The simplicity of it, and the analysis paralysis that come with your decisions.

I don't mind: the bland art. It makes it easier to play with non-gamers, but for me, I 'd prefer some chrome.

I hate: The 300 occupation and minor improvement cards. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Yet, I have no choice in the round cards. Yes, they show up at different time, but they are always the same cards. Why not include 8 different cards for the first round? and 6 for the second... Yes, that means you have to make chicken cards, maybe a church card, but that would give it real replayability.

I've only played this game 4 times, so I feel my current score is provisional. To me, this feels like it has about the same weight as Goa, but the theming gives it a more 'interactive' feel -- as though there's a story that I'm telling as I play. Still, I think the game would start to shine as it is replayed (making use of the wide array of cards), and would expect the score to increase (if the cards actually do vary the gameplay).

RATING: 10
If you play with deck drafting or even pre-built hands then this game is the best. There's really almost no chance and I love how it takes a very simple economic principle "scarcity of resources" and imputs it simply and beautifully into board game format. You all start absolutely equal (barring cards dealt, but drafting deals with most of that randomness) and really it's down to who does what with their resources. Everyone is given the same opportunity and there's no lucky rolls that are going to save you. My favourite type of game.

[ES] Gran juego de colocación de trabajadores y gestión de recursos que te mantiene siempre planeando acciones para lograr alimentar la familia y hacer mas puntos que tu oponente. Las adquisiciones menores y los oficios (unas 300 cartas) dan gran rejugabilidad y, aun cuando pierdes, el sentimiento de logro al ver tu granja  mitiga bastante la desilusión. Mis dos pegas: 1. Si eres el único con cartas malas al principio de la partida, resultara imposible ganar 2. El juego quizás pone demasiado enfazis en alimentar a tu familia, dejando muy poco margen para las demás acciones.

[EN] Great worker placement and resource management game that keeps you planning your actions several rounds ahead to feed your family and score enough points in the process. The occupation and minor improvement cards give the game huge replay value and, even when you lose, your finished farm feels rewarding enough. My two complaints: 1. Getting a much worse hand than your opponents will kill your chances to win before you even start 2. The game puts too much emphasis on feeding your family leaving little room for what you really want to do.

Great worker placement game, every move must be carefully considered, and I seem to always run into the "that was the spot I was going to take!" issue.

A deep strategic game that demands your concentration - I feel as if I need about 30 minutes before we start playing just to get my head around all the minor improvements and professions dealt to me! It's great, but not for everyone or every occasion - some see it as very dry, while the farming theme isn't the most engaging for some. I've put this up to an 8 now, having been playing it online and loving it.

RATING: 10
Very appealing game, with an excellent integrated theme, and easy to learn for such an in-depth, complex game.  Agricola is impressively scalable from 2-5 players(4 seems to be the sweet spot, with 3 close behind). The randomly drawn and vast amount of Improvement and Occupation cards keep the games and strategy fresh every time!  The out-of-this-world replayability factor of this game is what makes it truly special.

We normally draft, mixing in an assortment of decks.

This game is boring, repetitive and unforgiving. The occupation and minor improvement cards have a big influence on what you can and can not do. Get the wrong cards and you start at an disadvantage.

The scoring is also limited and you MUST score in all sections or else you will not get the basic max. score. The only ways to improve your score is by getting improvements or occupations. Choosing them will mean you probably will not optimize the basic score.

When I first played this game I really hated it.  There were so many options in the game, but resources were too tight to do anything other then feed your family (and that was often out of reach).  I played two more times and my opinion did not change.  I had no desire to ever play again. 

A couple years later my wife saw some people playing at a game day and got curious about the game.  I told her my opinion of the game, but she was stilled intrigued enough she wanted to know more.  Then we heard Rahdo raving about it on some of his top ten lists.  Doubt began to grow, it sounded almost like a different game.  From some of Rahdo's comments I begin to think I was taught the game wrong.

So, when Agricola showed up at Barnes & Noble my wife and I talked about it for a bit and we decided to get it.  I felt a little crazy for buying a game I hated but there were two points that made me take the plunge.  First, by this point my wife was really excited to try it out.  Second, if she didn't like it and my opinion didn't change I could always trade it, a popular game like this will usually generate interest quickly.

I setup while she made dinner.  And we gave it a shot after eating.  I had no memory of the occupation cards, I can't say if they were used in my first games or not.  But I know we were refilling the action spaces wrong.  In my first games the action spaces were only ever filled to their number of goods instead of adding that many goods and accumulating over time.  That made a HUGE difference in how the game played.  It was still challenging to do everything you wanted to do, but it was not impossible.  With that one difference in play the challenge went from infuriating to intriguing. 

By the end of my wife and I's game, we were both hooked.  I am happy I gave this one a chance to redeem itself.  Agricola will be staying in the collection.  My rating rose from a 5 to a 7 after that one play.  With more plays it may rise still more.

Update:  Dropped the rating to a 6  in the wake of a string of more interesting games that scratch a similar itch.  This still has a place in my collection, but it is beginning to fade some.

A pretty fun efficiency game, the labour of setting it up sometimes just doesn't feel worth it, at least not for a two player game. Variation provided by the cards is nice. Scales well.

RATING: 7
Played for the first time last night. Wow, there is a LOT going on.I am rather concerned that with the wrong players this game could melt down into an analysis paralysis nightmare.FWIW I won the game comfortabley without really knowing what I was doing.I have now played twice and won both games comfortably despite one other member of the group (a very good board games player) having played a lot more games than me. Both times I was in third place on round 1 and he was in 4th. I fear there may be a seating order problem in the 4 player game at least.Still worth trying a few more times but I won the last game with a score of 56 to 40, 31 and 21. I knew I was going to win from about turn 9, it was just a case of by how much.

A few more plays under the belt now and it is still just an OK game. Yes there is a lot of variability fron the cards but to be honest it just doesn't grab me. The end game is something I particularly disslike, the game starts well, builds nicely then goes flat. Agricola isn't alone in having this trait, I might be unusual in dissliking it so much.

Of the top 10 games I own all but two. Twighlight Struggle which just doesn't appeal and Agricola which I feel no desire to waste my gaming cash on. I will play the odd game at conventions and clubs with other people's copies but I just don't get the excitement :(

I finally buckled and bought a copy. I think my copy has been played at most twice. Perhaps I should not have bothered with the purchase.

RATING: 8.5
It isn't Caverna, but close enough to be a really good game :)

The ability to make the game different each play by using different sets of cards is what I think could make you want to play this rather than Caverna. It is also a bit harder and restricted than Caverna so if you have an inner need to be super efficient all the time this could be a better choice for you.

This used to be higher on my list, but the worst fever to play this has passed. It's still the top dog in the worker placement category though and always very enjoyable. The huge card decks make this one of the most re-playable games I've ever seen. Even with 8.5 it still soundly beats Puerto Rico in my books, in case you're interested in such comparisons...

This is very good, if this is the type of thing you like.  I need to play it a couple more times to really figure out how I feel about it.  There is no interaction other than buying stuff before others and a handful of other very minor mechanisms.  Other than that, it is an interesting and surprisingly easy to play efficiency engine game with a lot going on.  Fantastic game if you want a game where you don't interact at all.

I want to play it again to re-evaluate 

Updated, played again- still not totally sure if I like it.  It reminds me a little of through the ages in that I recognize there isn't nearly enough interaction, but I like it so much I think I could play it solo, so I don't care like I would with a lot of other games.  There is something very satisfying about building your food engine which delights me in much the same way through the ages does, only on a shorter, smaller scale.  Although I generally really hate games where the only interaction is competing for shared resources, I think I like economic engine building enough to overlook it. Now, if only Agricola had a war phase, I could rate it an 8!

RATING: 9.5
There are handful of things I don't like about this game: randomness and imbalances in the card draws, the start player mechanism.  But the fact is, it's really FUN; in fact, half of the excitement is looking at your hand and seeing what options you'll have this game.  And Agricola delivers better than any other game that delicious tension of having so many things you WANT to do, and yet never quite enough actions to do them all.

I actually got the same impression I had when playing Pillows Of The Earth... yes - it is for me no imporvement when you take nice mechanics of a reacently published game - i.e. Caylus - and add some also well known mechanics.

The art of a good design is not adding useless things, it is realizing what is useless and can be dropped.

All those cards here are for the fake of variety.

And yes, like some BGG-fellow already wrote - it was also something what felt odd to me while playing: why the heck can the neighbour hinder me in doing actions on my farm, because he does them on his too?
Didn't bother me that much at Caylus: you give an order to the jeweler so he is busy now. But here we give no external orders, we distribute tasks to our family members.

Anyways: The game is not bad. It was interesting to play. It looks cool. You can see that the designers cared about it (for example different images for rooms, actions, and so on) so there is a lot of work in it someone can easily see. But it is no milestone in gaming history (something what enayone might think when looking at all those 10s here).

Perhaps the game that solidified my long-term interest in the hobby. Played weekly for months with the same group of guys, which gave me an appreciation of the system that I have with few other games. Still, I'm more or less burnt out on the game, and will consider bringing it out only on request.

I'm not convinced that the key to the game is to draw the right cards at the start, though I have seen one or two glaring exceptions in mixed-deck play. The cards themselves add some flavor, but the real game is in properly timing your actions and doing what is needed just before the other players.

RATING: 9
While I felt a bit lost at first, the learning curve to at least understand the game is not really that bad. I was having a lot of fun by the end. Two things this game does better than any other game I have played. First is multiple paths to victory. There are so many ways to score points that you can focus on almost any of them or some hybridization of all of them. The end of the game leaves you feeling like you just didn't have enough time to score all the points you wanted to, so you will have some tough decisions to make as you realize how few actions you really get in each game. The second thing is being a game that is both very strategic and very tactical. You can almost break it down by the components: the cards in your opening hand are your cards for the whole game. They dictate your strategic options. Look over them and develop how you want to proceed. Then, the selection of actions adds a whole tactical level, in which you try to implement your strategy while getting in the way of what other people want to do as they get in your way. You have to adapt to this, as well as adapting to which actions come up in which order. We only played with the basic intro cards and I was dazzled by how many choices there were. This seems like a game that could never get stale, and seems to include expansions right in the box. It is a bit inaccessible to non-gamers though, and can take a bit long for what there is to do. I like games that have tons of options that you WANT to do but can't do them all more than games that have options you HAVE to do but can't do them all.

I find it astonishing the number of people who have committed $70 to a game they've neither played nor seen played.  Hype machine is in overdrive.  I'm watching this one with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Update (9/3/08): Played for the first time tonight.  I like it, but I'm not sure how much.  My main concern is being able to keep track of the cards in front of your opponents.  "Oh, you get 4 food whenever you get wood and you have 3 sheep in a pasture with an enclosed stable?  I'll be sure to remember that..."  With the number of cards in the deck, it's also going to take a long time before you can even get a handle on what the other players *could* have.  I think I prefer games that have more clearly defined bounds.  

Update (9/8/08) - From 7 to 8 - Played twice more with 2-players.  So far so good.  My biggest concerns about the game - keeping track of your opponents' cards and being able to develop a game to game strategy - have been largely assuaged.  Rating could go up if the game holds up under repeated plays with more players.

Update (9/16/08) - The cards seem extremely unbalanced -- and that's just in the Basic deck.  With that in mind, I'm not sure I'll be able to give this more than an 8.  More specifically, any starting hand has a theoretical maximum score.  The maximum score for any two starting hands could be significantly different.

Update (9/18/08) - Played four more times (2-player) with drafting variant, still with just the E deck.  Improves the game tremendously.  I'm raising this to a '9'.  Can't wait to see how this plays regularly with more players.

Update (9/24/08) - Played 16 times now, 12 of them 2 player.  My major complaint now with the game is that it's stressful.  Even when things go relatively well, it doesn't feel like it's going well.

Update (12/2/08) - Probably played over 30 times now.  Lately the majority of them have been 5-player.  The game now frustrates me to the point I'm not sure it's "fun."  I think I'm worse now at the game than I was a couple months ago.  Ironically, I think I might like it better if it were more of a multi-player solitaire game than it actually is.  Downgrading to an '8'.

Update (1/1/09) - Back to a 9 based on playing it 2-player again.  My rating for the 2-player game is near a 10, and my rating for the 5-player game is dropping toward a 7.

It might not be fair to rate this game on one single two player game that was... I don't know, years ago. I was entertained by it, I remember that much, but the thing is, throughout time, I never had any desire to get this to the table again. And if there is one strike against a game, than that one thing might be it. Got rid of it and never regreted it.

RATING: 7
On first play, I liked it, but was dismayed at how much the starting hand of 7 occupations and 7 small improvements changed the rules.  It's true that without those 14 cards, the game would be less interesting, but with them, it becomes easy to get lost in the analysis of "Hey, card A would be great to play, but maybe I should play card B first, but then I need to take a bunch of other actions first to get resources to get card B, so maybe I should play card C to help me get those resources faster" and so on.  Since the choice of actions is competitive, you even have to recalculate your plans when another player takes the action that you were counting on.

After playing it again, I felt less overwhelmed.  I realized that you probably won't be able to play all your 7 occupations or 7 small improvements, so don't plan on it!  It's important to pick a strategy at the beginning and go for it, without wasting too much time planning to play cards that are just too difficult to get out (or are worth very little in terms of resources or points).

I recently played a variant that helps reduce the luck somewhat -- everybody draws 10 occupations and 10 small improvements to start with, and discards down to 7 each before the game starts.  With this variant, it's even more important to pick a strategy at the beginning, rather than assuming you'll get all your occupations and improvements out.  Keep in mind that in a 5-player game, for example, the "small improvement" action will be very popular if everybody has a great selection of improvements to start with...

I also played the "Family Game" once (in combination with Farmers of the Moor, to keep down the complexity).  Even without the randomness of the Occupations and Minor Improvements, it seemed fun, but it would probably get boring if played too often, especially with the same group of players.

Amazing game. Scales well and plays different with different number of players. Improvements/Professions offer vast re-playability. Challenging. The overall sense of "not enough time to do everything you want to do" creates an exciting experience. There is a randomness in what cards you get - this can be smoothed out with drafting / eliminating cards people think are too powerful.

The best Euro game.
Agricola had established its position in the top three and everybody was talking about it, so I just had to try it. It really lived up to the expectations. Can't figure out anything bad to say about it. What appeals me most: 

-Very thematic for an Euro.
-Amount of different options per turn.
-Makes you want to play more and try something different.
-Amount of different cards guarantees the re-playability.

I  give this a somewhat low rating, because I really don't feel like playing it most of the time. It seems so dry and devoid of chrome to me.

As it is, I played once, didn't particularly like it, and avoided it ever since.

I was skeptical about the hype, but it turns out that Agricola is a great game. It gets the nod over Le Havre at our table because it's shorter, but still possess the great replayability and different routes to victory that Le Havre has. This game is better than Puerto Rico, and should be #1 in the rankings.

I like this game, but it doesn't get to the table like the 2P version does, and the group interest is Caverna instead.  But the recent 5 player play of this was really enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think this game is addictive for a few reasons. (1) The goal of building a nice and complete farm is always just beyond reach. Your family must eat a certain amount at certain intervals. The availability of actions is restricted. These contraints make playing Agricola a slightly frustrating (but never quite futile) experience. (2) The extreme and almost excessive variety of cards makes each game unique. (3) The game is multiplayer solitaire that also feels like a race. The interaction with others is indirect, but you cannot help but pay attention to what others are doing to gauge your own progress, watch to see if they interfere with your plans or if you can interfere with their plans.

Add these three features together and the result is that after each game, you are left slightly unsatisfied, but you are also left with the distinct feeling that the next game will be different -- that a satisfying gaming experience will happen next time. And so on.

Now that I played it, I can believe all the hype surrounding this game. I like the infinite replayability offered by the cards. I like the very hard choices to be made each round as to what action to choose. I like that it can REALLY be played solo.

What I would like to see is more interaction between the players. I think that adding the possibility to trade goods during the harvest would elevate this game even more. Maybe it would raise some issues. I'll think about it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Agricola - the family game is a decent worker placement game distinguished by it's unusual theme and nice bits, but somehow marred by a scoring system that greatly reduces the possible winning strategies; I rate it a 8.
Too bad the scoring system needlessly limits the winning strategies and leads to building the same farm over and again.

However, with the cards, the game is difficult to rate
-no effort was made to relate the working of the cards with their name or illustration: for example, a forester can plant a forest... in a firstly tilled field; wood is then harvested at the same rate cereals are...  with a little thought, a more true to the theme mechanic could have been implemented
-there are very nice combos, very nice single cards, but many feel pretty useless
-these uneven cards make the game extremely lucky; some cards are game breaking
-too many cards feel the same

In summary, I would have liked a smaller deck of better designed cards; Agricola cards are more about quantity that quality, and feel under-designed.
If more thought had been given to the cards, this could have been the perfect game.

RATING: 5.5
Talk about limited actions and the desire to do more.  Not for the faint of heart as the game will usually be a solid 2-3 hours.  Not to be played with folks who suffer from Analysis-Paralysis!

In this one you need to find the right combos which will yield you the best results.  The cards passed at the start of the game ensure good replay value, but I found they limited your options.  Then again, it forces everyone to adopt different strategies.

Played twice with 5-players and did not enjoy the experience.  The initial card handout will provide some players with an advantage.  Game is probably best with 4, as it is too tight with 5.  Was unable to get my strategy going due to the options being very limited.  Game ended with the leaders essentially doubling three of the five players!  36-34-21-20-20.

Play with 4 and it was much better.  Raised my rating, and am looking forward to trying it again, with 4.

What can I say about Agricola that hasn't already been said before? I think it has earned its rank because it is such a solid game that is also accessible, deeply replayable, as well as gorgeous and it works incredibly well across all of its player counts. 

-------
Edit: yet, at the same time, Agricola has become emblematic of many of the things that I am having a more difficult time swallowing about the game market: baked-in strategies, individual player boards, spatiality excised, and variability for the sake of variability. It's not that I don't want to play Agricola, but rather that I don't want every game I play (when going to meetups or other) to be a shadow of Agricola: at once a poor reflection of a masterpiece and yet another Euro game that moves away from family-accessible interactive games.

This is probably one of, if not the most, complicated game to teach someone to play. The family version is probably the best route to take when teaching someone the first time just so they can get the mechanics down. If you can get them through that and then two more games with the occupations and the minor improvements you'll get them hook.  It's just the challenge of getting them through the first three games...  :)

RATING: 10
This is an excellent game – one of my all-time favorites (right up there with Race for the Galaxy)!  This game is very stimulating to the brain.  It is a game that starts off simple enough, but takes off in complication in just a few rounds.  I find myself somewhat talkative and laid back during the first few rounds, but after, oh, say, round 3 (there’s 14 rounds in total), I am starting to really focus on strategy (actually, re-adjusting my strategy due to what others have claimed) and keeping my family fed while trying to build up my estate and family.  I think it is perfect in that regard (starting off relatively simple, but becoming complex in just a few rounds).

My son very much enjoys it, but I would have to say that my wife just “likes” it.  I think it would be rare for her to suggest it, but she is always open to playing it whenever my son or I suggest playing it.  I discovered that the very thing I find very interesting regarding the game is the thing that is a turn off for her:  the constant re-adjusting of strategy.  There has yet to be a game where my initial strategy has not been thwarted by one of my loved ones.  “I think I’ll try building fences early this game and get some sheep early on….What?  You just took the wood for my fences?  Oh, so we’re playing that way, eh? J  Okay, it looks like I’m going to plow some fields instead.”  I love that things are constantly changing (and needing to change), but my wife finds it irritating (at times, at least).  I will say this, though:  It is a heavier game and definitely takes concentration throughout the game (meaning, socialization becomes less and less as the game goes on).  And it can become somewhat tense (again, I think in a good way, my wife – not so much) towards the later part of the game when you are desperately needing to find ways to feed your family, but having trouble doing so, as others are in the same boat.

The final thing I’ll mention is that the cards (and extra decks you can buy) make every game slightly different.  I do wish that the items that always exist on the board and the “round” cards that are always used could be changed, but I understand that would be difficult to do and still keep the integrity of the game intact.

Overall, I highly recommend this game.

In some ways, I should probably drop this score down to like a 6 because I never will likely play it again.  Or at least not for several more years.  In fact I think I did lower the score at one point, then put it back up high just because of how important this game was to my development in the hobby.

Ag is the only game I have ever pre-ordered without having played first.  It just sounded so delightful and there was a chance it would never make it to the US so I bought through Z-man's pre-Kickstarter crowdfunding.

We played it something like 60 times in the first couple months after receiving it, absolutely devouring the depths of strategy and reveling in the horrifying tension of feeding your family.  Eventually, when we had figured out the strategy sufficient, I grew weary of the tension and have shelved it for the forseeable future.  But goddamn was that a fun ride for several weeks!

Wow people love this game! I, on the other hand, think it is only a very good game. The game has a lot going on and is fun to play. My problem is if you have a bad hand to start out with, you are going to have a tough time in the game. Friends have done a card drafting version that I have no idea how it worked and that might be the way to fix my issue. If it played faster, I might not have a problem with a bad game every so often, the aforementioned friends have played rather short sessions of this game. I know my rating could go up for this one if I get around my one major issue.

Clearly a game with serious depth, and the strategic variations through card play will be innumerable. The game will clearly reward experience and knowledge of the card powers and how they can interact. This is all for the good and makes it a game I will definitely explore much, much further. However, the fact that you get a limited hand of occupations and minor improvements and have no way to modify that hand could prove overly limiting and possibly lead to certain players having a built-in advantage, which (if true) would be a major drawback in a game of this depth and length.

One thing that is very important is to not be seduced by your cards - it takes an action (and often resources) to build each one, and the benefits aren't always as nice as you might originally envision. In many games, the player with the least cards in front of them is the winner.

After several games, I just don't see why so many consider this the pinnacle of gaming. It seems a fairly typical resource management engine without any truly novel mechanisms, the course of play is fairly slow and routinized, the strategies are highly constrained (unless you get certain cards, like the Yeoman Farmer, that allow you to ignore the diversity imperative), and the initial card draw can occasionally determine the course of your game.  It's still decent, but the fact that there are many other resource management and/or worker placement games that I would consider to be far, far superior (e.g., Antiquity, Caylus, Le Havre) means that I don't expect to ever find myself requesting a game of Agricola. (I'd still play it, but only if the group can't be convinced to tackle one of the other titles instead.)

Somehow i like the game mechanics, but i absolutely hate the feeling of the game. Ohh my boy look how beautiful pet we have, i hope you love him so much. But now after we loved him hard time comes and we must kill it to have something to eat... Another thing is that i feel like the game finishes too early i haven't got enough time to finish the things that i want to.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
Because a lot of player suggested so after the revised edition came out i tought why not give it another chance. The bad feeling i have had before completely gone and i started to enjoy the game quite much. The revised edition has fewer cards but they put into the box the most balanced ones so it is a welcome upgrade of course. They reworked the art which becomes more beautiful however i didn't have a problem with the old one. Unfortunatelly the production quality of the game board dropped quite a bit and with the attaching thing can be damaged very easily. There are not enough resource tokens we ran out of wood and brick in numerous occasions. Because of this im thinking about getting the old version instead. I believe this game has a very high replay value because every game is different by what actions you proceed and what cards you are dealt in the start. It seems that there are numerous strategies to pursue which all capable of winning the game in the end. A little bit bigger player interaction would be nice though. I think this was an outstanding game when it came out but there are simply better games nowadays.

It is another game where you have to calculate and optimize your play- nothing to get excited about. The simulation aspect is very superficial: yes, you have to build an oven in order to bake bread, but in the end it is only about collecting wooden cubes to score the most points.  Nothing wrong with that, but don't tell me this is a farming simulation. This is as much about farming as Tikal is about an expedition.  
It is also too long: after one and half hours putting colored wooden cubes on my board and back, I thought: ok, that was fun, now something else- oh, we are just halfway throught-oh my...

Each game can feel very different depending on what tasks you're doing and what occupations/improvements you're benefiting from.

It is absolutely one of my favorites.  The solo experience alone is worth a 10 playing in less than an hour and being a fun, engaging, lighter fare than the multiplayer counterpart.  The solo version plays in 45-60 minutes, and playing with players who are familiar with the game doesn't take too much longer than that.

Purchased std. version on eBay (no added decks) - played 3x solo, once with wife, and clearly see this one is as solid as promised, with lots of potential. (7.5)

Escalated to (8) - played solo w/Through the Seasons, which both adds flavor and opportunity that I like a lot. 6/13/09

Dropped to 7.75, mostly because fiddly setup diminshes play opportunities, but tempted to drop further because of lost enjoyment w/actual gameplay.

My all-time most played board game.  After about 75 plays my group finally started getting tired of it.  The game can feel like the same game over and over but I think the randomness of the occupation/minor improvement cards keeps it fresh.

I personally prefer this one over Caverna.  My friends are split on that.

The farmers of the Moors expansion is alright but it will definitely tack on a bunch of time to your play.

Agricola is a bit of a quandry. I don't like it with all of the cards but without them (the family version) it is lacking IMO. My gaming buddes want to play with all of the cards so we are in a bit of a mess. my gf didn't really like it, I think the interaction was to indirect, and the theme was kinda meh for het
I have to try and play it with some of the cards soon

PL: Gra z talią podstawową, bez ulepszeń i pomocników jest średnio interesująca, ale pozwala obczaić mechanikę gry. Prawdziwa zabawa rozpoczyna się wraz z talią rozszerzoną. Czacha dymi niejednokrotnie, zwoje są rozgrzane do czerwoności, gdy próbujesz planować ruchy swojej rodziny, starajac się zarazem przewidzieć posunięcia przeciwnika. Aż strach myśleć co wydarzy się przy talii zlożonej, albo liczbie graczy większej niż 2...

Much as I love this game, I confess we've developed an extremely forgiving set of house rules under which we treat each other like five year olds who will throw massive tantrums if we don't get to build our pretty, pretty farms exactly the way we want them.

We also circle-draft our occupations and minor imporovements instead of just dealing out hands of seven. It adds half an hour to the game, but it's a big improvement.

Agricola starts off slow, but once it picks up, becomes so fun. It's not perfect, but the sheer number of paths one could take toward victory make Puerto Rico look anemic. Relatively balanced decks, neat art and flavor, and very engaging to me.

Plays by Solo rules, and implementing Cooperative rules.  This introduces Woe, News, and Goal cards for the group as well as a Barter action to trade goods.  I think it is very promising, and may be more interesting to a wider audience that the current Cooperative leaders (Shadows over Camelot and Battlestart Galactica).

This was our first foray into euro games and we loved it.  We could play the basic version with our little kids and ramp it up with our teenagers.  Many nights spent stressing over resources, calculating that last turn and trying to step away with the win.  Great theme that gave us numerous great conversations with our kids about how farms, bartering and commerce work.

RATING: 7
Good euro in which, against all odds, has some theme.Except for the darn plow. You mean that, for many years, only one person was allowed to plow per turn? Did they only have one Hoe in the village or something?

I didn't like how the game deals with player order though: Instead of having a rotating player order, or one dictated by each player's actions, like Year of the Dragon or Power Grid. We get the absolute worst of both worlds: A player can pay to be first, and then it goes around. This makes sitting arrangements important, and that's not a good thing. 

In a game I played, the player on my left would ALWAYS try to get the first player token with his last action, even if the current arrangements had him go second. Of course the player to his left won handily.

The grand daddy of Uwe Rosenburg games. The turns are fast. The rulebook is thick but the gameplay is very fluid. The cards add asymmetry between players. Many possible strategies.  On the downside, you spend 3/4 of your actions making sure your family is well fed and just as your farm starts looking good, the game ends.  Fired by Caverna.

I know it's a sort of crime around here, but I haven't actually played Agricola against other people. My regular group have some experience with it and don't like it. I, on the other hand, think it's an interesting little adventure in resource allocation. It's a game about farming and trying to support your family through your agrerian lifestyle, but it's the mechanics, not the theme, that keep me coming back.

RATING: 8
Agricola is a lot of fun. I like the "family" rules better than playing with the cards, but I think both ways are quite enjoyable. I love seeing my farm building up as the game goes on, and some of the choices that can be made to try and score some points by diversifying.

This game is fun to play. Every turn you try to do everything you need to until you realize that you really can't do everything. Then you have to make the agonizing decision what you wanna do. But I really like that. You just try to do your best and at the end you have your little farm in front of you. Sometimes it looks good with pastures full of animals and fields with grain and vegetables. Other times... well it looks not so good. But still I find the game fun.

Family version works fine and it's fun to play. Actually I was suprised how interesting the game was, because I had read that the cards really make the game and thought that the family game wouldn't be that interesting. When you add minor improvements and occupations there's more choises for you and you can try to build your strategy based on those cards. I only have one game under my belt with the cards so I can't say much more about them other that they definitely make the game little more complicated.

It's a 9 now, but lets see when I get more plays with the cards if this have what it takes to climb to 10.

Oh and this game is a pain to keep organized. You have tons of wooden pieces and the box doesn't have any insert so you have to bag them all in plastic bags. I definitely need to work out some easier way to keep those pieces organized.

RATING: 4.5
I like this, I can see it's more replayable than stone age but I see a couple of differences.

1) it's more complicated and I found the gains to be minor

2) it seems difficult to play your cards and so it's over before you're really into it

Would play again though

---

Edit: no I wouldn't. I've come to really dislike Uwe Rosenburgs games generally the more I've played them. Loads of card options and combos and never enough time to complete them

I get that it's meant to be a struggle but not all games should feel this unfulfilling all the time

Played it for the first time at a meetup.  The cards make for a different game for each player everytime. Worker placement a la Stone Age and Leonard Da Vinci. Adding major improvements like buildings in Puerto Rico. Resource management/growth like the plantations in PR. Sheep. Wild Boars. Cattle. Vegetables? Worry about baking bread so your kids don't starve and end up begging. It feels like a race to make the best farm, but there's never enough time... Initial rating: '8'.

Update-After playing it ten times, and having played Dominion most recently, I'm starting to get annoyed at the fidgety nature of the game--there are so many little bits and pieces, compared to only so many cards in Dominion. Yes, they are different games, so they each have a different feel. With five players the game has dragged to four hours, especially since we haven't played it in awhile.

Update-After teaching this game several times, it has become apparent that this is a complex game, even though the mechanics are simple. I am upping the weight to 'medium heavy'. There are so many things going on, as the number of options and paths to victory are numerous. There is substantial luck in the draw of the seven occupation and seven minor improvement cards. You're dead if you don't get a good hand, but it is also total dependent on your skill getting the hand out IF you are so blessed to have a good hand, and know how to maximize their effects.

Update-After playing it my 14th time, our group grumbles whenever this is suggested. I am beginning to dislike this game. It seems one in my group (not me) has managed to win 8 out of 9 times, with scores in the 40+ each time. I think I'm hitting a trough here, as I find it frustrating with setup and tear-down, along with the feeling of dread that I won't be able to do much with the hand I'm dealt, the resignation that comes with realizing within the first hour that I have already screwed up, and that I have to suffer through 2.5-3 hrs of torture for that mistake. And what is it with this "bake bread" action? It takes too many actions to set this up, while someone with the Baker or Brewer card is pretty much destined to win. The game is not forgiving, and amplifies any mistakes one makes early in the game. This can be said of Puerto Rico and Power Grid, as they are near-perfect information games also, but most of my group still struggles to really 'understand' this game. Rating dropped from '8' to '7'.

Update-Game 15: Okay, I had the baker and the "plow 3x fields twice a game" cards, but still did poorly. So, it's not just the cards but how you play them.

Update (09/17/09): This game hasn't seen the light of day since January. I simply don't want to play this game anymore--I don't want to "tread water" for 2.5 hrs and get crushed by someone else who had better cards. There are better, faster, more fun games out there. The "herd" has moved onto Le Havre, which has turned me off as well, as it is more of the same, just with a different theme. I  think this game has reached its apex, and now we are waiting for the next fresh face to arrive. I'm downgrading this to a '6' from a '7'.

Update (08/28/10) 16 plays: Downgrading from '6' to '4', because you're going to have to do a LOT of talking to convince me to play this sado-masochistic's wet-dream come true game again. I played it again after 11 months, and still don't like the game. Now, I need a stiff drink to buzz away the feeling of mediocrity and shame I get after coming up with only 13 lousy points. Why subject myself to this kind of pain?

Update (09/14/12): Haven't played it in two years, although my copy gets an infrequent play with others in my gaming group. After trying Le Havre a number of times, I've come to the conclusion that I don't like the designs of Uwe Rosenberg. So, I avoid his latest incarnations, such as the Gates of Loyang and Ora et Labora, which are just another rehash of "collecting and turning it into something else". That doesn't mean I don't respect Agricola or any of his other designs, as they are important, significant events in the chronology of board gaming evolution. I simply no longer wish to be a part of it.

[b]tl;dr[/b] — It's time to get excited about farming!  Farming.  And man, did we ever get excited.  This thing hit like dynamite fishing and then we fought a massive war over it.  And when I finally got to plowin' with my doughty farm-wife the earth gave up its dead because they only moved the headstones.  50+ face-to-face plays.

[imageid=276736 small]
UPDATE:  Well, there's massive shrinkage in Hell—I picked up a copy and I'm actually looking forward to playing it!

[b][thread=393626][/thread][/b]

UP-UPDATE:  I can totally see how people can rate this a 10.  It's charming and mildly haunting, and there are actually opportunities to dump a turd in the downstream player's punchbowl.  "Yeah, I didn't need that food.  I went fishing just to watch your kids starve."

Ultimately, though, this gets stuck in the dreaded 7 ghetto—good enough, but missing that special something.  And that something is a theme that isn't farming.

[b]After 17 plays:[/b]  I'm bumping this up to an 8.  My wife [i]loves[/i] it, and I find her enthusiasm for the game infectious.  With two relatively experienced players—and wine—the game flies by; the struggle and decision-making is a pleasant diversion, and the tiny model farm you wind up with at the end is nifty.

FINAL ANALYSIS:  All things being equal, the cards make or break the game.  Either you get a fistful of synergy that showers you with freebies or you sit and watch someone else play that game.  I suppose this could be mitigated with some kind of card draft or other time-consuming setup step, but really, the game isn't that deep or robust to support such shenanigans.  This sensitivity to the vagaries of luck keeps the game firmly wedged in the "whipped dessert" category—very tasty, but ultimately nothing more than sugar and air.

[b]After 27 plays:[/b]  Revising down to a 7.  Familiarity is bleeding this one out, especially after a brutal string of games with poor card draws.  Also, the tension in the 5p game is unpleasant, or, more correctly, is out of whack with the payoff for suffering it.  There are only so many times you can circle the drain of reductive choice where it's pastry, pie, cookie, crumb, bowl of poop before losing your mind and fantasizing about rolling some dice and kicking in the door of the guy who wasted the sow space for baking and using the axe you invented on his family.

"You got Ceramics?  I got Clogs, bitches!  CLOOOGS!!!"

So far the 2p game is my favorite—it's over quickly enough that a bad hand is tolerable.  Two or 3p is definitely the sweet spot for this.

[b]After 38 plays:[/b]  Revising down to a 6.  Not timeless, not a classic, and it's about farming.  [i]Farming![/i]

[b]After 50 plays:[/b]  Bumping it back up to a 7.  My wife really, [i]really[/i] loves it, and that softens my hard heart.  Besides, our last game was really weird—I didn't try my usual min-maxing by following the script that always nets 40+ points—I went after a wheat baron's seven-room stone mansion with constant barbeques.  Meanwhile, my wife deviated from her script as well, with the game ending up 24-21 in my favor.  I like weird.

Original comment:

[i]Finally, a solution to the 400-year-old problem of four-player farming...  This "game" gets a well-deserved 1 for being the epitome of Euroslack; as a good gaming buddy always says when Euros hit the table (with a wet plop, I might add):  "What am I in this one, a farmer?"  It pulls a 1.11 for only being available in Ancient Atlantean (that crazy mouth-stumbling they call a "language")—note to the designer:  I hope you make a bajillion dollars selling this to all those multitudes of Atlantis who are obviously going to be going game-nuts over it.  Sheesh.  [BGG CON III got [i]played[/i]][/i]

Final analysis:

[i]By all accounts this game is the Second Coming of [gameid=18602] With Three Testicles.*  The tidal wave of hype surrounding this should be more than enough to obliterate the actions of 17 rogue BGGers.

At first I really disliked this game because the number of options can be overwhelming and the game makes me feel like I'm constantly struggling. As I've played it more the number of options and setup combinations is what I like most about Agricola. Each game feels unique and every decision is difficult. While the game is still stressful, it has gotten a LOT more fun over time.

Rating after 1 play (4 players): First of all, Agricola is undeniably a very good game, hence the 8. I will, in all likelihood buy a copy (my wife loved it), however I fail to grasp the intricacies of efficient production/consumption engine when playing  most economic games, often finding myself drifting through most part of the games and just hitting my stride when they are about to end. Definitely need to play more . I really liked the action selection and the fact that more people mean more actions (and more food consumption!) was quite revealing. Good game.

I don't know what it is about this game.  It's fun, but yet I fear playing it.  If a boardgame could be an intense-edge-of-your-seat thriller, this would be it for me. In no other game that i've played do I worry this much about losing.  maybe it's the suspense of not knowing what the score is  until the last minute.  You need a large table though or play on the floor. 

9/4/13.  Game is now mine again!  Sold to a buddy and used the proceeds to buy Cavum.  traded Cavum for Silverton.  Installed fiber optic star ceiling in buddy's house - Payment:  the same copy of agricola I sold him to begin with.

Note: I have played this a great deal before I created a BGG account.

This game, while very well-designed, is a bit too stressful for us at times.

Edit 9/16: After some reflection I think I realized what my main issue is with Agricola. Most of the game feels like a struggle to barely scrape by, which is quite thematic. However, the ending feels very abrupt. The game is over just as you finally start to get an engine going. While I think this is probably the correct design choice, it is a feature that decreases my  personal enjoyment of the game.

Occupations and minor improvement cards add a huge amount of variety and really changes up the potential strategies.  Luck plays a huge role especially if the person to your right is going after a similar strategy as you are (due to cards dealt) - you have to decide quickly and early to change your approach.

Played once.

All components, box included, in excellent conditions – or "very good", I guess, according to BGG standards, since it seems that the moment you play something you can't say "like new", which in my mind is what describe the condition best.

Full disclosure: upon close inspection, I see the very faint indent of someone testing a ball pen on a sheet of paper, using the box cover as the hard surface. The game nazi in me is seething in anger, but trust me, this was not done on my watch. That's how I got the game from the store. This small detail only shows up at a particular angle of light. I'm very anal retentive and I only saw this years after I've acquired the game.

Finally got to play this! It's a pretty standard worker placement except that the actions are mostly all unavailable until 'harvest' rounds are completed and then the order of the available actions per round is random in each game. It was fun. I would play it again.

I need a few more plays of this to really see how I feel about it. I enjoyed the game, but didn't like the unfinished feeling I got when the game ended (I know that's kind of the point). However, I continued to think about the game even after it was done, so I'm thinking this one will become a favourite. I really liked how tense the gameplay was, even with only 2 players. Very tight game, and looks like it has a ton of replayability with the huge amount of cards and tough choices.
Update: After a couple more plays, I upgraded my rating. Really love the tension in this game and the card play, and after each play I immediately start thinking about how to do better the next time.
Update: Upgraded my rating to a 10. After so many plays, I still pretty much want to play this all the time. Think that speaks for itself. :)

I didn't think I liked this so much at first, and I'm still not the world's biggest fan, but I'm digging it more and more. It's very well themed for a strong Euro, and the variability of cards in each game forces new strategies on the fly. Good stuff.

RATING: 9
My first board game (excepting Monopoly and the like) and, while the learning curve was steep for me, totally worth it. After the 2nd game you play you already have a good idea of what to do and what not to do. 
I'd recommend at least 3 players. With two, the one who played more games will always win. But with more people, there's always the chance that someone will want to do the same action as you.
 Its a blast in 5, although it takes about 2-3 hours

Changed the grade to a 9. Still enjoying this, but it is hard to get it to the table when we are 4 or 5. Guess it is because of the additional options we have, and also because it tends to take quite a long time

RATING: 7
I like the game but at the end of the day the small niggling complaints mount up and keep me from giving this a higher rating.

Has a lot of great concepts: variable turn order, random ordering of when actions become available, variety through the cards, easy-to-understand the goal (though the final scoring is a bit non-intuitive).

I can understand why people like it so much.

The tokens the game comes with are bland. There is a reason so many people pimp their games. The cards add variability but don't seem entirely balanced. You can fix this by drafting but that requires everyone know what does/doesn't constitute a good card.

Relatively low interaction with other players. Blocking someone by taking an action is about it. Way better than Race for the Galaxy or Dominion, though.

If I were to praise this game then it would be for the time spent balancing all the different possibilities.  If I were to criticise it then I would point out that it is extremely boring!

I bought Agricola because I wanted to try to get into it.  It must be really good to have been at number one on BGG, surely?!  I just don't understand.  Each turn is a chore.  I do not like the feeling of wanting to do everything at once.  It must be a personal thing.  I do not really enjoy worker placement games at the best of times, and Agricola is worker placement at its most frustrating!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This isn't an awful game but is hugely overhyped. The game has far too much luck with the Minor Improvements and Employment cards. This makes it far more luck driven than say Caylus. While it does have more longer range planning than Caylus it does not really match up to either Puerto Rico or Power Grid in that regard.

Just can't see why it is rated so highly. Not bad, but not that good either.

I'm probably most excited about this aspect of the game, since until this point I had yet to find a solitaire game that is deep, challenging, and fun.  This is simply the best solitaire game I've ever played.  Agricola is a fantastic game all around.  The depth and variety, with all of the cards, make it fresh and fun each time.  I've successfully played different paths to victory.  Deserves the #1 spot.

RATING: 8
A fun, but exceedingly complex game. Not good for non-gamer friends, mine tended to make what they deemed to be the 'best farm' which would incorporate a good engine but in the end would be very low on points. Also, for the price and praise it has received, the many errors on the printed cards and the broken occupations really are unacceptable. Although, I did like it enough to join the cult of Fimo, so all criticism should be taken with a grain of salt.

It's too easy to make a couple of bad choices, or sometimes just have bad luck, and cause half the game to be a painful struggle just to feed your people, without any prospect of improving your situation.  When it's a 4 or 5 player game you can be in this unpleasant situation for an hour or more.

That said, this game has completely recaptivated me. During its first couple of years it got played every week at our game club, and often more than once, but I would not often join in. For the past few months I've been suggesting it almost every week at both of my weekly game nights.

RATING: 4
A academic well-made example of the Euro genre. Orchestrates so multiple interweaving yet smooth flowing mechanics without feeling cumbersome. 

But this game isn't as much fun. The scoring system forces every player to attempt meeting every criteria with stiff penalties for any misses. The 'Feeding' mechanic just furthers the abuse.

It's like a well-organised swimming competition riddled with poisonous jellyfish, deadly undercurrents, stinging rays etc. If you held your head above water for that long, then you're doing pretty well already. Great example of an Euro but the game could do with less gruelling punishment for more fun.

1.動物繁殖 每兩隻生一隻  只會產生一次
2.農田
農田需要經過三個階段耕種才可收成
a.犁田 (一次一個田，田與田之間也要相連)
b.拿種子 (一個種子，之後可由收成的作物中播種)
c.播種
(每次在播種階段，先放一顆種子在田上，然後麥子從外面拿兩個新的麥子疊在上面
蔬菜則放上種子後，從外面再拿額外一個蔬菜疊上，也就是田上只有兩個。
可一次播多個田，也可一次播兩種植物的種子)
3.行動格
a.注意的是有箭頭符號的代表會累計，當這回合沒人領取的時候下回合會增加
相反的沒有就是不會，像是臨時工這格的食物就不會累計
b.當人數在三人以上的時候，最左邊的行動格會增加綠色的行動卡(上面有標示使用人數)
家庭板和正式板須注意有無家庭的符號，行動卡上也有分家庭和正式兩面
c.藍色的回合卡依照回合所在季節直接放在對應的季節裡，總共6季14回合
每回合翻開一張新的回合卡，並將資源補上，一開始須先翻開第一張回合卡
d.注意有些格子有兩種以上功能，如果是(和/或)則可以直接執行第二段功能
但是如果是XXXXXX之後可以再OOOOOO，
則第一個動作"必"執行後才可以選擇執行第二階段動作
4.壁爐可用烤爐直接換不用加資源(耗兩回合)
5.收成階段
收成分三階段，順序很重要
a.農田上作物收割 (每個田都拿下一個作物)
b.餵養家庭成員 (每個人要兩份食物，這回合剛生的一份，未轉換的麥或蔬菜可當1食物)
c.動物繁殖 (兩隻以上可繁殖一隻，兩隻可生一隻，一百隻也只生一隻，動物不需餵養)
順序記住不可亂，也就是說剛收割的植物可以拿去餵養，蔬菜也用爐子轉換成食物
但是不能把新生的動物在這回合轉換成食物拿來餵養家庭成員，要也是下季的事了

Agricola is complicated to explain, but it is still fun for newcomers, especially if you give them some animeeples.  There is just something about the theme that makes it fun to develop your own farm, even if it is just a pile of weeds compared to others.  My main doubt about the game is if the cards are balanced enough for me to enjoy the game in the long term.  So I can't rate it higher than a 9 at this time.

I played once, with 5, and found the down time for the game a bit too much.  Also, I found the cards to be a bit unfair.  If you get dealt things that work well together, sweet.  If you get dealt things that work together and aren't in the same category as other players you don't have competition for your advantage and that's even sweeter.

I'd like to try with drafting the improvement and job cards, and with at least one less player.

This game is amazing. Surprisingly easy to explain and understand given its complexity. Seems to scale well for all numbers of players though game length can increase unpleasantly with player count.

Unfortunately there is a barrier to cross between just surviving and maximizing your score. If some players are still in the "just surviving" stage of their play and other players are in the maximizing stage, the game is no longer fun for the struggling players since it's obvious they aren't going to win and the maximizing players' turns take much longer (Not just because of analyzing but sometimes we're talking about having a 5 person family vs a 2 person family)

Furthermore, Agricola has a large upfront information load in terms of your starting occupations and minor improvements. This can be overwhelming for new players.

Firstly, I love card-driven games and this one comes with a completely irresistible theme that draws you in and keeps you engaged for the entire playing time. There are agonising decisions throughout, you want to do everything, but only get a few actions each turn. The game also has a very different feel in its 4 and 5 player incarnations with animals much more accessible when 5 play, but it's the quality and consistency of the card decks that's the most questionable aspect. The E, I and K decks don't vary the game as much as their names imply and very similar cards (e.g. ploughs) appear in all three. I also don't like the endgame scoring that awards negative points for any commodity that you don't have (I suspect this was dictated by the deck limitations, just in case your initial card draw gave you a runaway 'sheep engine' or something), making each game essentially the same. The major criticism is that even though this is a 2 hour game, far too much is decided by the initial cards that you're dealt. Card synergy and who is first to get an extra family member are the major success determinants. I quickly tired of the basic game, card variety and consistency is way behind that in Race for the Galaxy for instance, but once in a while the attractive theme is enough to see it through.

Played once using the "family game" rules. There are so many options for building up your farm, but someone else is likely to take them before you...and even if you get what you want you still have to constantly worry about feeding your growing family! Kinda liked it but it's too long, too Euro and the only "interaction" is of the annoying, blocking actions, variety. It loses another point because I don't like games where you have lots of different ways to score VPs.

Yep, it's a game about doing things in the right order.  And it's lots and lots of fun.  I love putting together my farm and making things work together. I love the card combos and the way it feels like really building something and the free form nature of it--it really feels as if  you can put you farm together however you like, though it isn't obvious if you look at it at the end. Really satisfying and after over 20 plays, I think it's safe to say this will be a favorite for a long time.

EDIT: Frankly, if you don't think Agricola is awesome, you simply don't play games for the same reasons I do. If you want a satisfying building experience, this is it!  Must.. play...more... 

EDIT AGAIN: Yeah, for now I am pretty sure I'm madly in love with this. The more I play, the more I want to keep playing.

COOLER OBSERVATIONS: The issues with the game are as follows:  1) it is very much a giant fiddly mess.  The upkeep is pretty intense.  2) Turn order can matter, especially with a smaller number of players.  3) Yes, it is possible to get a very good hand and that does influence the outcome.  I have tried the drafting variant and like it quite a bit.

But except for #2, these are integral parts of what I love about the game too and I will happily forgive them.

This one seems ok so far. I think i need to play it more, as I have only had one proper game, plus one learning games, but so far standard euro fare. The family game is a complete waste of time for me. The full game is interesting and opens up the game. I don't think it is superior to the plethora of other great eurogames, but it certainly deserves to stand amongst them.

While this is a solidly designed game, it's quite a bit too "solitaire" for my tastes, especially considering the playing time.  So many other games elegantly (and in less time) cover the same sort of game with more interaction (Stone Age is the most recent game that comes to mind).  While I appreciate the cards bringing added flavor and variety, they also appear to sometimes unbalance things.  It's a good game, and I'll play it, but I can't agree with it's current rating and ranking.

A decent game but not my favorite.  The action selection is ok, but the game is much more dull than its cave-dwelling sibling.  Also the role cards feel terribly unbalanced.  The game offers a great deal of misery and angst throughout as you are trying to build and engine for the end game while making sure your family doesnt starve along the way.  If you like that kind of tension this game will be one you might enjoy.  The unbalance in action pawns moves the game away from other games that top my list.

Hard to figure out the first time I played, but now that I get it, I like it.  The game is a lot of strategy and a lot of figuring out what you can do with the cards you are dealt.  There are tons of cards and each player only gets 12, so the strategy can change every time.

I do not like it. To me, it is the "No, you can't do that!" game because if I want to take an action a.) someone else already took it, or b.) I don't have the resources to do it. The cards turn me off, there is too much to read and the decisions are more like solving a puzzle alone than playing a game with other people.

Unfortunately it is highly regarded in my game group. :(

I bought this game because, at the time, it was the #1 rated game. No regrets about such a purchase, as it is indeed one of the best. Rather playing with the cards or not, there is a lot of stuff to do and a lot of strategy to think about. It's also fun playing with the pieces, and I have enough imagination to pretend disks are people and cubes are sheep. A lot of people complain about the farming theme, but I for one love it (then again, I'm descended from farmers). Also makes for a great solo game, for when one needs to play around with cardboard and wood chunks yet has nobody around to join them.

This game seems to always end right when you get your plans rolling. I need some more practice to get everything done in the allotted amount of turns.

Not a bad game at all.  Pretty standard for a euro-style game.

The original worker placement. It's a little dated now, and the players can tend to get stuck in their own world with little player interaction, but still a great game. Replay ability is high with starting decks and random round cards, as these will force you to try different strategies. I also like how there is little feeling for who is winning until the end tally.

Resulta dificil creer que un juego para jugones pueda ser accesible para quienes no lo son. Parece combinar lo mejor de Caylus (elección de acciones, construcción)con un cierto toque de los juegos de cartas coleccionables. Esfuerzo de la editorial Homoludicus que merecía que lo comprara. Buenos componentes (animeeples), no es largo, gran rejugabilidad y escala muy bien de 1 a 5 jugadores. Me encanta la sensación de competir contra los demás (“que no me quiten esa acción”) y a la vez competir contra el propio sistema de juego (mendicidad, cosechas…). No es un juego para pensar a largo plazo, sino que favorece a los jugadores que se adaptan al desarrollo de la partida. Estaba por encima de Le Havre en mi lista personal por el componente de iniciación que tiene. Ahora compruebo que LH es mejor juego.

It´s dificult to belive it, but Agricola is a gamer´s game that is very  accesible to the rookies. It combines the best of Caylus (action selection and building) with a bit of CCG. Homoludicus, the Spanish editor did a big effort and he deserved my buy. It has good componets (animeeples), it isn´t extremely long, has a lot of replayability. I love the felleing of being in competition against the rest of players and against the game itself (begging and harvests). It´s not a strategic game, so is easier to the player that doesn´t think in long term and addapts better when he´s playing. Agricola has higher score on my own ranking than Le Havre becouse of  his "gateway flavour", but Le Havre is a better game, IMHO.

Awesome game. The crazy thing about this game is that you never really feel accomplished because the game goes by so fast. You don't have time to make any mistakes and you really have to have a strategy and stick to it or your going to get penalized in the end. I would of never thought a farming game would be so fun. After a game ends I always want to play again.

The game is solid but I feel the 14 rounds limitation together with the scoring system that forces you to have a bit of everything do not allow for a healthy variety of strategies to come to fruition. Those parameters create a too limiting environment that forces you to adopt more or less the same strategy every single game. Looking forward to playing Caverna and seeing if that improves on these issues.

I'm not sure I've ever played a game as delightfully maddening as Agricola.  The game play is brutally unforgiving - rare is the game of Agricola where every single player doesn't feel like the game is going terribly.  Fortunately, though, the pastoral theme goes a long way towards blunting the games' harshness. It hits the sweet spot between having many options on any given turn and not being completely overwhelming, and the food requirement adds a good amount of tension to the game and requires a sometimes painful balance between short term needs and long term strategy.  The occupation and improvement cards give the game immense replay value as you try to discover the best card combinations in your hand.  I'm knocking off a half point for the fiddliness of replenishing resources, but that's a very minor complaint.  Overall a very excellent game.

Updated to say that my original rating is for playing with the basic decks.  After limited experience with the complex and interactive decks I would rate the game lower when playing with either of those, as the cards are way too unbalanced (based on playing the iPad game, combining all the decks seems to be okay, the above comment refers to using the K and I decks in isolation).

Interesting farm game. Can't say that I'm getting into the hype like many others did over this one. It just didn't grab me. The interaction between players is minimal and the cards seem to influence things a bit too much for my liking. Granted I have to say that most every time the balance is pretty even keel. The production quality is nice and the game plays fairly quickly once all are up to speed. All and all it's a good game but not a great game.

First played October 2nd, 2008. Taught in 30min, played in 2hrs for 5 players. This game seems well balanced. If anything it has more strategy than luck in it. The game is filled with options. Each player starts out with a player area with 15 spots. A two rooms house fills two squares and two people fill each room (1 person per room). The start player gets two "food" and each subsequent player gets three food. There is a main play area with actions that can be taken. Your people you have act as your action points. So everyone starts out with two action points. Actions are: collect food, grain, vegetable, animal(sheep,pig,cow), wood, clay, stone, add room, upgrade house, plow land, sow crops(if you have any) build fence(cost 1 wood for each section), build stable(doubles fenced in compacity) add family member, play occupation(special actions), minor upgrade(special actions), major upgrade(better special actions). Many of the actions cost materials,etc. The game is played over 14 round and there are harvest / feedings along the way (rnd 4,7,9,11,13,14. You must have two food for each person you have at each harvest. If you have two animals they have a baby. Fun game that keeps your interest throughout. You won't realize it has taken two hours after you finish. I strongly recommend giving this a try especially if you know someone who has it.

A snowstorm hit, and everything was shutting down early. We barely made it home... and then got noticed that our copy of Agricola had been delivered to the office. We suited back up, hoped the buses wouldn't stop running, and braved the storm, but it was worth it. We played twice, staying up 'til almost midnight. I was prepared to be overwhelmed by the rules and details, but we were up and running surprisingly quickly, and it is so well designed that we had very few checks back to the rule book.

So far I've only played solitaire and 2 player, both of which seem to be fairly slow.  I can see from the other action cards that the game will really start to shine the more players you have, and was obviously designed with 5 players in mind.  The rules are simple, but the available actions and activities provide the complexity.  I can only see myself enjoying this more as I play with more people.

-------------------------

In this game about farming in late Medieval Europe, players take control of a couple on a farm, and must ensure their economic and social success by breeding animals, growing vegetables, growing their family, upgrading their house and many other actions. It can be played across the full common gaming spectrum of 1-6, and thus has a long shelf-life, especially with the Full Game and the Family Game options, and the three different decks of cards to use.

I must comment first about the atmosphere this game conjures; that of tension and suspense, unusual for a eurogame because of their dry nature, but in [i]Agricola[/i], the pressure of having to continually take care of your farm, animals, and family can be quite real. This is felt most during the early stages of the game, and seems to disappear towards the end, to be replaced by the fight with the other players to claim the powerful end-game action spaces. Definitely one of the things this game does well.

The game play revolves around the recently popular worker placement mechanism, brought into popular view by [i]Caylus[/i] in 2005. With only a handful of actions available in the beginning, expanding to a plethora in the end, [i]Agricola[/i] captures the feel of an expanding industry very well. The way in which all the parts of the game; crops, animals, and the cards, mesh also heightens this feeling of development. No part of the game feels like it has been pasted on, nor does anything feel ‘gamey’, at least nothing that I have found. The worker selection works very well in this game and brings the interaction into an otherwise solitaire game. The little luck is sufficiently restricted with limited foreknowledge, and can be mitigated entirely through forward planning. 

My only problem with this game is the lack of distinct paths to victory; there is only one way you can win, and that is by having a little of everything, the hand of cards that you get and the way the other players interact with you can affect this, but I still feel that this is a considerable drawback, as they do not affect the end state, only alter the means slightly, and it is this that stops it from attaining a 9. 

[b]Pros[/b]
- Great atmosphere
- High player interaction
- High replayability 
- Emphasis on planning
- Mechanisms interlinked

[b]Cons[/b]
- Limited path to victory
- Solitaire version lacks tension
- Full Game may be too heavy for casual gamers
- Many counters and cubes make it fiddly

A game that lasts over an hour but I still like it. 
15-7-2010 We played Agricola with our daughter who turned 8 a few months ago and she loved the game. She had a lot of animeeples on her farm at the end of the game. It was so cute to see her fall in love with her farm and she actually did quite good building it. Next time we will add the big investments. 

Hard to get this one to the table. Bought the app, so now I can play solo.

Simple worker-placement mechanisms hide a deep and profoundly satisfying game, satisfaction that partly comes from the totally integrated theme, one that really makes you feel like you are building and growing a life on a 17th century subsistence farm.

Current favorite. Still in learning curve. Part of game is thinking afterward what I could have played differently.

Complex. But not a game of surprise turnovers. Very difficult to catch the leader. 

Playgroup wavered initially if they actually liked the game or now, even as they help upgrade the components. The family game was initially preferred and the cards were seen as too complex. Now they have settled in to liking the variety of E deck, but the K and I decks are still somewhat scary and avoided.

King of worker placement.  Long play time with slightly dry topic means this doesn't get the love it deserves.  An excellent resource economy game that isn't too hard to understand, forces you to fight with players for control of resources (but when you lose, there are lots of other things you need so it isn't terrible), but offers variety to scoring.

2 player version of this (just like Caverna) may replace it.

In Dec 07 I pre-ordered from Z-man and made my own paste up version with bits from other games.  I got my Z-Man pre-order Aug 4th 08 and have returned the bits to their own games.  

I have played solo, 2, 3, 4 and 5 player games and then more players you have the more exiting it gets.  It has been described as multi-player solitaire but in my experience there is interaction with the other players.  Choosing the actions you are going to do and when you choose them can be influenced by other players. There was lots of interaction in our 5 player game and using the "I" deck helps introduce more interaction.

The solo games I have played have been challenging and I want to see if I can do better. In multiplayer games, several new players in the groups I have taught it to are ready to play it play again. Even if you lose there is a "let's try it again and see if I can do better".

Replayability is GREAT!  None of the games that I have played have been the same and your strategy will change based on the cards you have and what actions and paths the other players follow. 

[2-23-2008] I have played like 14 games which have been a 2, 3 and 4 player games.  They have all been different and have required different strategies.  Used the Interactive deck in a 4 player game (4 E cards and 3 I cards) and WOW! My opinion of the games still stands - GREAT GAME!

[8-4-2008] Got the Z-Man pre-order and sleeved the cards.  They are thinner then the "old magic cards" I had sleeved with the paste-ups previously. Other then the cards being a little thin all of the other components are Great and the Animeeples are cool.

The classic Rosenberg game. I like the theme of building and developing a small farm. It's a tough game, with interesting choices and strategies. Resources are scarce which is ultimately why I don't enjoy it as much as its successor Caverna.

I'm warming to it, gradually. I still think it's too 'backended'. With good players, farms often seem pretty much empty until the last round or so, then suddenly its fences everywhere. Seems a bit odd to me. But what do I know.

Because only hard-core gamers play games about farming!  This game is so good, I actually had to go back and reduce the score on some of the other games in my collection to reflect the awesomeness of this one.  I never would have thought that a game about farming could be so good.  The game it's self is easy to learn and play despite seemingly complex rules, however deep levels of strategy and calculation will reward advanced players.
The box is absolutely packed with components (cards, game boards, various wooden tokens and markers).  So much so, it can be a little tricky to get everything back into the box nicely!
I am usually not a fan of euro-style games, but this is an absolute must for any game fan.

Agricola is a challenging game!  Whether you win or lose, you rarely feel as if you have accomplished everything that you had originally planned.  There are a multitude of successful strategies to win and it is difficult to balance your efforts across the different scoring conditions.  Speaking of balancing your efforts, you are penalized if you do not try to do a little bit of everything.  However, it can be quite frustrating for a player who is looking for a lighter game.  Unfortunately, I have not tested all of the card play-sets.  I am sure they offer even more variety and bang for your buck in a game that is already mentally stimulating and feels fresh on most plays.

A really good game, perhaps even a great game... but not the best game in the world. Not in my book. Too much fear of hunger and too many rules that mix things that seem absolutely logical theme-wise with hillarious logical incosistencies (yes, I'm talking about single-handed baby making). I like the gameplay and the animeeples too much to ever trade it, but I can't see it coming close to my top ten... ever.

A fun puzzle farming worker placement game.  You are always trying to figure out how to get the most out of your farming seasons.  You always feel like your family isn't going to make it.  Has a feeling like competive solitaire but in a good way.  One of the funnest, deepest, but easy to play games I have ever seen.  Great game.

RATING: 8
Terrific game.  Always more that you want to do than you have actions to implement.

We always play the full version of the game.  I probably should try the family version just for comparison, as the full version provides just a hair too many things to think about for some players (and likely for younger players).

The Occupation and Minor Improvement cards add a good amount of re-playability.

Aug08: Oh yes, the hype-o-matic 3000. How was it? Not that bad really. I've only played the family game, but it was thematic and engaging. The play made sense and there were plenty of meaningful choices.

Now on to the bad:

I don't like worker placement, too passive aggressive. Way too many similar bits, I don't need 3 shades of brown in my game just for the sake of the theme. It takes a little too long for the payoff in my opinion.

There is tons of room for skillful play however. Experienced players just trounced all over the newbies.

So... good, not great.

I'll try it again with the cards. However, it seems to add an extra hour to the play time around here...

Great worker placement game with a lot of flavor and variety - I particularly like it with the special meeples box I bought. There is much to like in the concept, art and flow, especially when you add the cards.

Key negatives are (1) length of time per game and, correspondingly, teaching it to others, (2) elements of randomness, (3) being forced into a box of strategy rather than enjoying totally open strategy, and (4) a level of Euroness that turns off many more casual players in my group. 

Also, it wears less well on me with more plays than some of my other games. As such, it hits the table less often.

Seriously, i had problems with the theme of the game. There was no interesting part in farming, breeding animals and sowing plants.

The game proved that i was very wrong.

Excellent gameplay, alternative ways to play with different decks, even the solo variaton had so much enjoyable moments than most games. It was brilliant.

Mechanics are old and it feels old. Tensed game and beautiful design but there are plenty better games in the same concept.

I'm tempted to rate this higher than I currently have it. Agricola is a milestone worker-placement and still probably the best of the genre for people who want to focus more on their personal board than blocking other players (although that's still present!). The starting hand of cards keep this game fresh more than anything.

Quite close to being the perfect game. Variable setup, variable player powers (in so far as minor improvements + occupations mean that), worker placement, highly thematic, tense.

While I will play this game anytime anyone else is willing, it does not get suggested as much around our house. Frankly, I'm not as excited about it as some other less highly ranked games. I have tried to figure out exactly why this game is not as popular here since it is so well-received among gamers. 

Refilling all the resources on the board each time (despite all the good advice I have read from people about how to do this) is distracting and never compensated for by the feeling I get when I am playing Brass or Puerto Rico of "wow, this game works so smoothly and elegantly to lay before you a number of interesting decisions." 

Update 8/12/11: Sat on shelf so traded for Hamburgum. Odd trade on face of it considering the rating differences, but I think Ham will get played and that's where the value is.

Playing with the cards rather than the family game was a revelation. Now, it becomes interesting to fit a strategy to the cards so that the final scoring focus does not appear as confining.

Not really my cup of tea. I will play if someone really wants to, but I don't usually suggest this one. I am just not that good at worker placement games where that is pretty much the only mechanic.

I guess the game is Ok.  I'll play if asked, but I'm not going to pull it off the shelf myself.  The cards really provide re-playability, but it is pretty much multiplayer solitair.  Rarely is it worth making a sub-optimal move for you just to screw another player.  The theme does nothing for me, and the game play seems dry.   I can see why the tight mechanics appeal to many people, just not me.

I enjoy the complexity and variability of Agricola.  The fact that their does not seem to be a straight forward path to victory. 

I enjoy a random factor in games therefore I prefer a random selection of cards and prefer that approach much more than drafting or discarding from a larger pool or cards.

This is a great game, my wife, 14 year old son, and I really enjoy playing it. I have two other children, 8 - 13 years old, that also play it, but they prefer other board games. As a result it is not played as too much. My wife and I really enjoy it and would play it more if we had more players. A great game overall that plays best with more than 3 players. It continues to be a good game in our collection- but I am sure will be replaced by the many other games by the same designer, when we get one of them (caverna maybe?)

Only played 2 player so far, 4 plays. I actually played Caverna first and then tried Agricola, and I'm not sure which I like better. Rubies in Caverna help in some tough spots and prevent feel-bad, but it makes planning harder. I also really like the improvement cards.

I initially rated this a 4, but upped it a bit after a couple more plays.

RATING: 10
Played 8 multi-player games and a solo series. I see Agricola as a core game that works well and is well-themed but that might became stale after several plays; and an expansion in the form of the many Occupation and Minor Improvement cards. While the cards add to the theme of the game and clearly provide a lot of variety, they also seem to cause a couple of problems even when restricting them to the Basic (E) Deck. The first problem is that they add substantially to the length of a game as players refer to them while also considering the many possible actions inherent in the core game. The second problem is that they are not balanced; some cards are better than others. It seems to me as if the cards in Agricola have not been fully tested and developed. I would have preferred that the game had a much smaller set of carefully balanced cards and/or a well-defined mechanism for balancing each player's hand of cards. Perhaps the different card decks and the variant rules enable such a game to be played, but the rulebook provides no clear guidance on this; indeed the rulebook could be better in many ways. No doubt Agricola blossoms as a game when all players have many plays under their belt; but until I reach that stage, I have to judge the game somewhat critically.

UPDATE: after a few plays, I still see a problem with the cards: a couple of good cards can really help win you the game, while a poor set of cards can make it difficult in the first few rounds (I've seen one or the other in my own hand in most of the games I've played). A fellow player pointed out that the rather untidy -1 scoring is entirely unnecessary: all scores could be increased by 1 point so that there are 0-5 points in each category. My opinion remains that Agricola is at heart a very good game, that would have benefited from more testing and development. 

FURTHER UPDATE: after several more plays, I am enjoying Agricola more than ever. The card system, while it has its problems, certainly ensures that each game is different. 

FINAL OPINION: with more than 20 games under my belt I can at last rate Agricola as a 10. I have recently found that the variants help to mitigate the above-mentioned problem with the cards, and I've also enjoyed some 2-player games.

just got my copy last week. i've played 10x already. 2 solo, 4 'advanced' (w/2 players) and 4 family (w/ 3 players). each has been enjoyable. so far it plays well with 1, 2 or 3. the family game is fun and should be used to learn/teach the game. the advanced game is where this shines. The cards add a whole new level of complexity and options. at the moment, i have this as a solid 9. i'm not sure if it'll make a 10, remain at 9 or drop to 8. but after 10 plays, it seems like a very solid game.

RATING: 7
After a couple of plays, my initial thought is that this is a good game but nothing new or inventive in the game and absolutely nothing that warrants the amount of hype and devotion that this game gets.

The cards adds variety to the game, and in the games I've played it's the person who got the best hand wins the game as they were able to use it to eliminate one of the required actions (such as feeding the families).  

Due to the scoring methodology, actual game play plays pretty much the same as you have to at least go for one of everything to avoid negative points.

Its it hyped yes.  But folks, it really is damn good.  I've only played the "family" game so far, but even with that, I am impressed.  There are some definite Caylus parallels, but it is more tightly integrated to the theme, and somehow, that made all the difference from me.

Based on 3 games using the "E" deck. Very solid game.  I liked it better than Caylus, and it is just another iteration of grind it out worker placement games.  However, the hand of cards and the integration of theme add a lot to this game, and I currently can't stop thinking about it.

RATING: 4
The Occupations and Minor Improvements favor players who are dealt synergistic cards which compounds the problem of the start player action space being a waste of an action if the Minor Improvements you were dealt are sub-par or not synergistic with your strategy.

I could be convinced to play again if the cards are drafted before the game, or possibly if using the World Championship deck which is supposedly balanced.

I'd rather play Caverna

One of the best worker placement games I've played. Definitely stressful, which I suppose is what 15th century farming felt like.

It went from 8.5 through 9 and 9.5 to reach finally 10 after 18th game.. Absolutely splendid game, extremely replayable.

Placement of workers might be known from other games, but Agricola has its own very original feel - it's just amazing...
  This is very satisfactory game, no matter what the number of players (even 1) and no matter in which place you finish.  Tension is great (even if you play in solo mode!).

It floored me how such a simple and fast paced game could contain such variety.  With the ridiculous amount of occupations and minor improvements, Agricola is a different game every play. Colorful art and pieces lend an attractive visual appeal that similar Euros lack.  The subject matter (farming in the 1500s, ho-hum) is dry but the gameplay and art most certainly are not.  Unlike other Euros I've played, the theme integrates perfectly into the mechanics.

Worker placement:Variable powers:Engine game

inital rating (8.5) 1 play 4 players (03/04/08)

Who knew farming could be fun? The hype IS most likely justified IMO. Maybe not the next coming or anything but pretty damn good already. 

A very strong themed game actually as people are farmers trying to max out their farm as much as possible. Indeed a game of efficiency at heart that has a very nice blend of strategic planning and tactical jostling. The tactical game is of course quite similiar to Caylus where you are placing your workers trying to grab the best things available, the similarity pretty much stops there though. 

Starting the game everyone gets 14 special power cards to help them in their quest, these of course will somewhat dictate your strategic path and because there are so many cards it is hard to imagine a dominant strategy emerging for some time. This also means huge replayability as you will need to adjust your play from game to game in order to max out your efficiency with the cards you get dealt. 

Very much an engine building game like RFTG actually where you try to get your improvements down asap in order to be able to do more with less. A ton of special powers here just like that game also through the cards and also a ton of ways to score points! (and lose points!) I was a little overwhelmed my first game which almost never happens and is a good sign (lots of scoring and lots going on all over the place), I got caught up in the tactical grab game and lost track of all the scoring and before I knew it the game was ending, pretty engaging and came in around 2 hours with 4. 

Looking forward to more plays, not sure about scaling down to 2 players, I hear it works well so there must be some changes in how different goods come out and action selection I guess. Of course another potential negative is the card balance and how someone's hand could be much better than yours right from the start, just draw 3 extra cards and discard 3 crappy ones. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 9  Five plays in, played the 2,3,4 and 5 player game and it scales very well (see below however).  Ranks 3, 4, 2 then 5. We have noticed big swings in card luck and while the cards may not be as important as they seem, it can be just too much to compete against someone with really good matching and useful cards. This means drafting now becomes a necessity (tried extra with dumping) which unfortunately adds considerable time to the game hence 5 is the weakest number just due to time, the game scales perfectly as far as mechanics and balance but just takes too long with 5, even without the draft (which we tried)

So this sounds kind of negative, why the raise in rating then?  The theme is simply outstanding, everything in the game just drips of theme and nothing in the game goes against it at all either, it seems every detail was considered thematically. The 360 cards are unbelievable as well, every card I think I seen so far has been named perfectly for the benefits they provide, Uwe and company must of spent many hours on these and it shows. Most of the cards seem [i] fairly [/i] balanced considering how many there are, there are some odd really good ones, especially when combined with the right card or cards hence the need for the draft. For a high strategy game, luck really needs to be reduced as much as possible and this looks to be the only way to an even distribution.  

What really pushes the game to greatness though is the absolute stress of trying to do everything while never being able to, similiar to a lot of good games and most recently "In the Year of the Dragon". The stress is high because actions really start running out and your farm will suffer negative points should you neglect any part of it, (in Dragon you suffer small disasters for any neglect) this price you are going to pay is ever present and agonizing. It also has the addictive quality of that game where you really want to improve your game and beat your score or the current high score (again RFTG anyone?) and also shares the great engine building aspect of both of those games as well. 

The only other [i]possible[/i] negative besides what I already mentioned is the way the game forces you to play a balanced game as everything is important, this is a strength to be sure but maybe a negative too. I'm not sure this will have any 'multiple paths' so to speak as the end goal of this game will not change, build the best farm possible with lots of everything for max points. Not diversifying or focusing on just some things versus everything I think will mean you won't win as someone who did will beat you the way the scoring is structured, more games to confirm.  This could mean we may not see any little side strategies show up, they might but at 5 games I don't see it, right now it looks like it is just a matter of picking the right cards, playing the right amount of cards, at the right time and especially in the right order. This card play along with having different cards every game to mesh together is fun and adds its own variance strategy-wise along with wicked replay. Of course the order of actions is also critical and what this all means is while maybe there isn't true mutiple strategies you can still execute a very satisfying game long plan, definitely a high strategy game no question and there is still some variance in how you will get to that end goal in both the order of how you excute your plan and with which cards you keep and play. Might be my final rating but if I'm still playing after 20 games and gameplay does not need improvement in any way it could just hit 10 (my criteria for "10" along with meeting my 9 criteria) 

Great game. 

[u]Tidbit[/u] - I think the suggestion of the least negative points breaks the tie was the best I seen so far but my opinion could change after many more games.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9 => 10 Only 8 plays, this is only the second time I have broken my 20 game rule (POF before at 11) and only my 4th "10" rating. I know I will be playing well after 20 games and it is already threatening the 3 games above it in my top 10.  The game is excruiating maybe more than any other game I know, its extremely challenging as the rounds speed by with so much to do and I love a great challenge. Imagine juggling while walking a tight-rope 50 feet in the air...that is Agricola with the right group, a constant juggling of actions and cards while trying to keep your head just above water and also trying to get or stay ahead of the others at the table. I don't think I care anymore about multiple paths, the entire game is about planning so its a high strategy game regardless and the cards really help alleviate any feeling of only one path. (edit - after 20 plays the game does feel somewhat formulaic but no more than POF) It can be pretty unforgiving if your playing with other good players, similiar to POF in both those ways and I do kinda get the same feeling out of it as you try to execute your game long plan but remain flexible along the way. Another POF trait, winning between a game of good gamers will often come down to 'the little things' [ie 1 grain :P ] and this will keep it VERY tense throughout. 

The draft is the only way to go now, at least for us. We have it down to 10-15 minutes and it removes almost all the luck out of the game. The draft is really a "sub-game" within the game itself and a pretty cool one, VERY tough decisions as you ALWAYS want to keep more than one card, great stuff. The game scales perfectly 2 to 5 and feels a little different at each number which also helps to keep it fresh. It is important to watch the other players in every game, especially for blocking actions and the "I" deck also provides some nice interaction as well.  The game is fun although there can be a lot of 'quiet' rounds while people calculate and plan, yet another POF trait. Though I have made many comparisons throughout to show certain strengths and Uwe has admitted borrowing things from other games, Agricola comes out feeling very different from pretty much any other game and is a unique playing experience unto itself. 

You simply can't ask much more from a game than what this offers. 

Thank you Uwe for such an awesome game.

I don't like how you have to score in every area (grain, sheep, fence, etc.) to have a chance at winning. There is not enough specialization in my opinion, and too much solitaire-like play. Good if you love euro-spreadsheet style games, but not for me.

RATING: 8
I find that Agricola did not live up to the hype.  I was very excited about trying this game only to discover that it felt a lot like Caylus feels.  There is a lot going on and, as a beginner, it is extremely hard to tell if the actions you are taking will actually be beneficial to you or not.  Familiarity with the cards, building costs, and timing of harvests would help and would be gained through additional plays.

The problem for me here is that I'm not going to be able to find face to face opponents who will be willing to learn this game over the course of several plays.  I need a game that draws people in on the first play.

Also, I'm really starting to lean toward games with more player interaction.  The player interaction in Agricola is minimal and indirect at best.  A game of Agricola feels much more like playing against the system than playing against the other players.  I expected to buy this and didn't.  I've taken it off my wishlist.

UPDATE:  My brother ended up buying this and I've gotten several more plays in.  I'm enjoying this more and more =)  I've bumped my rating up to a 7.

UPDATE AGAIN:  Wow - I love this game!  This is now an 8 and is solidly on my top ten games list.  I prefer playing with the K deck.  Scales very well.  Enjoyable with anywhere from two to five players.  Player interaction picks up a bit in the two player game.

RATING: 7.6
In Agricola, players manage a family trying to survive off of the land during the Middle Ages.  Each turn, players assign their family members to certain life-on-the-farm tasks; provided that another player has not already selected their desired task during that turn.  The game advances almost too quickly, making the players feel as if there is insufficient time to complete their goals making, Agricola an engaging but stressful experience.  I generally end up worrying more about producing enough resources to feed family members and rethinking strategies when denied resources by another player's action sequence than spending time enjoying building up my farm.  Overall, this is a good game – but the stress tends to erode my enjoyment, making it a game that I am usually willing to play but not one that I yearn to play.

As a game, Agricola doesn't really excite me. It's essentially just a standard worker placement game and all of the actions are pretty generic. I'll agree that it's probably a very good implementation of worker placement. But at the end of the day that's all it is, and a straight up worker placement game is never really going to excite me as a game. It's true that the cards aren't all perfectly balanced, but they're close enough for most people to have a good game out of it. And getting extra workers is incredibly important, probably moreso than any other worker placement game I've played, but if everyone knows that going in and plans around fighting over reed, the build action, and family growth then it's probably fine and in fact might make for the kind of game I'd otherwise like. But the core of the game just coming down to straightforward worker placement just doesn't excite me.

Now, all of Uwe Rosenberg's other big box games are basically just worker placement games as well, and yet I've rated them higher. What's the key difference? All of his other games are more of sandboxes than Agricola, which is a much more directed experience. Firm direction and being required to do certain things and jump through specific hoops is probably better for a proper game, and so if you like worker placement as a core mechanic and like serious competitive games, this one will probably be your favorite of his. But for me, since I'm not too excited about them as games, I can enjoy his other big box titles almost as romps, just doing cool things and collecting whatever I want and seeing how many whatevers I can get and how effectively I can convert them in more valuable whatevers. I can just enjoy myself exploring and experiencing the games, since I don't really care about them as games. They're very similar to Mage Knight in that way. But you very much can't do that in Agricola, something that might be a bit of a shock if you're coming from Caverna.

The theme in this one is so pervasive throughout all components and throughout the gameplay that it's just a lot of fun to play - even if you don't win.

The mechanics are really fun, but as soon as you start to gain on your opponents the game is already ending.  You never really get a chance to strategize or build yourself up.  There's a constant struggle to simply avoid famine and there's very little in the way of spring back mechanics to give players who had a bad season a chance to catch up with the leader.

This game has one problem that causes it to be a stressful game for many, the worker placement denial means that whoever is doing really well comes at the expense of someone else having a miserable game. 

These days in order to try and make sure everyone at the table is enjoying themselves, I try to steer away from games that do this.

It's still a great game, but the only thing this has going for it over Caverna is the variable setup.

RATING: 8.5
Many plays now with all decks and numbers of players.

It's great fun building up and improving your farm, agonizing over actions, formulating an initial strategy with your cards, balancing short-term needs with long, and adjusting to what other players are doing.

I do wonder if this game will hold appeal after so many games. Not that the card combinations aren't nearly limitless, but the game's linear turn order is already feeling a little "same-y"--get your production engine going, ramp up the family, maximize VPs. But nearly every game is "same-y"--AT, Wargame, Euro, Card--there are rules and a framework. The beauty (or lack thereof) is in the details--which I think Agricola has in spades.

I've rated this a 9 for now. I would always want to play, even if I'm not certain of its longevity. -- 8/2/2009: Played two games yesterday--still fun, but not as fun as I remembered. The linearity bothered me a little. Re-rated to 8.5

Not a game for non-gamers.

I've played this out, solo. The practice was helpful, but it will only be enjoyable against others now--not being able to count on resources being there.

Great fun with more players, though. 3 or 4-players IS the sweet spot. 5 is fun only if everyone moves things along. -- 8/2/2009: I like the 5-player action cards -- stone, boar and cattle are available early.

This is one of my Favorite Games.

PRO:
Solid Strategy & Worker Placement Game; Plays well with different range of players;

CON:
You are penalized by not creating a farm of everything, and victory points earned by each item has a limit. Though I understand the idea, that you want to create a successful farm all around (with animals, crops, family, nice houses and stable...) it limits your path to victory. You will have to do everything, you cannot attain victory through just farming, or through just breeding. I don't mind this, but I listing it as a con.

Each player is a farmer which sounds boring but is a really fun game.  It's a worker placement game where each turn you take turns grabbing one of the locations with a worker.  There are resources to gather, pastures and fields to build, rooms to add and upgrade, and ultimately families to expand.  Every choice is agonizing and there is much player interaction as you seek to get what you need while blocking other players.  Some asymmetry and variety is added by cards that provide a benefit that are not available to the other players, helping to keep things from getting too scripted but not so much as to keep things from becoming luck-based.  A real brain burner!

RATING: 7.5
The epitome of a eurogame.  Lots of nice looking components.  The game mechanics leave you spoiled with choices.  There's a little bit of backstabbing going on.  

But, it avoids some common Euro pitfalls: it scales exceptionally well.  (*gasp*  It even solos well!)  It moves along at a reasonable clip.  (The last third of the game feels like a runaway train.)  Not super-easy to teach, but intuitive after you walk someone through a couple of turns.

Love it.

I've only played this one once and it was against extremely experienced players. The problem with that is that I didn't get room to experiment with the game as there was no room for error.

I'm hoping this one doesn't have the same "only good with groups that have similar experience levels" issue that Puerto Rico has, because it seems like there is a fun game here.

The production value is fantastic.  The game is fun, and deeper than it appears at first.

If the game didn't take so long to set-up and tear down, it'd be more like an 8 for me.  Since it's a chore to get this thing on the table, other games tend to win out.

------------

I've had a surge of interest recently. Especially as a two-player game I find myself wanting to play more than I used to. My wife enjoys it, or at least tolerates it, and will play with me. I even taught my 5-year-old to play the family game. She's so proud of her farms, and grasps a lot more about the game than I expected. The fact that a good looking, well rounded farm usually has a decent score is probably the root of this. My daughter builds what looks good to her, and ends up doing just fine.

So far Agricola has failed to grab me, but my friends like it.  When I play Agricola, I can't help but think that I would rather be playing Caylus.  I prefer Caylus for the following reasons - worker activation is more interesting and involves more planning to make sure you have the right resources at the right time, more confrontation via the provost, less fiddly, less of a table hog, less luck, and ultimately I find the strategy in Caylus to be more interesting.

Not much to say that hasn't already been said. A modern classic in the worker placement genre! The plentiful Occupation and Improvement cards ensure lots of replayability. 

The stress that this game induces in trying to feed your struggling family is one of my favorite feelings in gaming (though certainly not for everyone.)

Watching your farm develop in front of you is also an added bonus. Animeeples!

Generally a good game but definitely not a game for everyone.  The game can go a little long.  

Best if played with a balanced group of players. The only element of luck in this game is the starting Occupation and Minor Improvement cards that you receive.  Therefore, a seasoned player can wipe the table with their opponents.

Perfect game for me, but loses point for:

I have played solo, and with 2, 4 and 5 players.  The game dynamics worked with all the player combinations, and the competition for resources and actions was tense.

In all cases the cards have provided variability and changed the items you focus on in order to meet your goals.  The food engine must be considered early as without a plan you will be struggling just to feed your family.

The components are wonderful, with the minor exception of the cards which seem slightly flimsy.  Bonus points for replay value and the use of different action cards for different player numbers.

A great farming game! With nothing left to the random (totally dice less) this game leaves space to a great strategic development (something similar to chess game). It's a pleasure playing it since it doesn't create attrition between players but it still keeps competivity high.

I have discovered that worker placement is my least favorite type - the board doesn't change in worker placement games.  At least in Agricola, your farm changes though.  Still, at it's length and complexity (highest avg weight in my collection) this one will rarely see much play.  I've finished a couple of solo campaigns, but they feel more like a brainburning optimization puzzle than a game.

I really thought this game was annoying. I didn't really have free range of what I wanted to do because of the "lose points for not having some of everything" bit.  The theme was there, but I wasn't very excited for a farm-based game, but that doesn't detract from the flaws I saw in gameplay.  With the players I was up against, I never seemed to get anything I needed - it was always taken from me beforehand.  The number of bits I had to keep track of was annoying, feeding the family, though thematic, was consistently problematic, there was too much going on for me to feel at all in control of my farm.  I did not have fun at all.

I first thought it was just a bad first experience.  But the second, third, fourth, and fifth games all proved equally as annoying and aggravating.  I much prefer Stone Age; that game is all around amazing.  I'm sorry, but I had no joy playing this game at all, and cannot understand the hype.  Completely over-rated.

RATING: 9.2
I like the complexity. I like how the game gives you certain stress because you need to avoid the starvation in your family. I like how the player needs to have always a plan B because of the opponent's action(s) and one needs to observe what is the other player's strategy. The thing that may bother me in some games we've played, but just a bit, is when some cards feel over- or underpowered.

Presenting a lot of tough choices, Agricola is a tried and true gem of a game. I made the mistake of putting this one on the table for a group of gamers who haven't played many board games. It was fun, but it ran longer than I had anticipated for it. Lesson learned. 
I'm up to playing this any time.

Rating after 4 plays.  It's an excellent efficiency engine game, if that's your bag.  I enjoy this particular genre of games (not all the time), and think Agricola has the potential to be one of the best.  In some ways, there's even less player interaction than Puerto Rico (which is bad).  However, the multitude of ways you can get your engine working, and the replayability due to the sheer number of cards makes it really stand out.  If you don't like this kind of game, stay far away.  If you do, give it a try.  I'll be re-evaluating my rating after several more plays, to see if it has staying power.

Update 1: It's 4 years after Agricola's release and I still love this game.  It's infinitely replayable, plays in a good timeframe, has an interesting mix of decisions, etc.

Update 2013 July:  Moved to a 10.  I never tire of this game.  I only have about 20-30 plays, so I'm not nearly as burned out as some people may be.  I imagine enjoying this for years to come.

This game looks intriguing. I'm looking forward to trying it again. Second try, last place in a 5 player oops. Ended with 31 pts, first place was 37pts. First had 5 family, I (last place) had 3 family for a 6 point difference.

Notes: Increase family size quickly. Need a child and 5 food for first jump. There is not one path to victory. You must start with harvesting and then go hearding, or vice versa. By the end you have to have planted, hearded and increased family size.

Extremely well done game. The decisions are tense from beginning to end, the rules are highly intuitive and easy to explain and the play length is just right.

RATING: 5
My rating of a 5 is misleading. If this game were handed in as an assignment, I'd give it an A+. However, that doesn't mean that I like to play it. Because I don't.

There is only one path to victory: (in this order) collect wood, expand house & family ASAP, diversify. There's no need to explore different strategies because they won't work against a player that chooses to follow the one path to victory. And once that player takes the lead, there is no catching up. The game is simply a fierce competition for wood, expansion, diversification. There are many tactics within the strategy, but only one strategy. With a game that has this much going on, this many cards, tokens, tiles, and board space, you'd think that there would be many ways to win. There aren't.

I want to like this game more than I do. I love having to develop and manage the farm, but the game is too much like the setting it models: an environment unforgiving of errors, with an excess of struggle and a lack of fun.

Also, even within the game world a lot of suspension of disbelief is required. If (for one example out of many) two players have ovens for baking bread, they can't both simultaneously bake bread. Yes, sure, it's a game and the rules are there to restrict and guide game play, but it still bothers me. Other players' contrived explanations to help with the suspension of disbelief are equally implausible. "Maybe there's only one oven and what you're gaining is not the oven itself, but permission to use the one oven." Well, cripe, if this actually happened in real life, wouldn't they just build a second oven? Ok, ok, suspension of disbelief.

Other than that, it's an extraordinarily well-designed game.

I very much love Agricola. Despite the set number of rounds and the same decision tree, the numerous cards make every game a different decision path on how to get your farm-engine running. Even amongst a few "basic strategies", I have seen some unexpected outcomes and interesting strategies develop.

The down-side is teaching the game to new players: there is a lot going on and the setup is daunting to the inexperienced.

This is an excellent game, as I'm sure you already know, but it can be a bit long for my taste with lots of players.  In my first game, I decided to give up on trying to figure out what everyone else was doing and play it as multi-player solitaire.  That seemed to work, as I won with 30 points (2nd place had 29; it was a 5-player Family game).  Update: After 2 games, I upgraded it from 6 to 7, but after 4 games, I put it back down to 6.  Finding a coherent strategy is proving to be much more work than I want to put into a game.  Later update: At some point, I pushed it back up to a 7.  I don't play very often, but as long as I don't worry too much about min/maxing and I just enjoy building my farm, it's a good time.  Another update: I haven't played this in almost 2 years, so I'm downgrading it again.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent worker-placement game from Uwe Rosenberg, and one which I have played a lot since I first got my German (and subsequently my English) copy of the game.

I do prefer the game with fewer rather than more players: 2-player is fun, and 3-player is probably my favorite. With 4 or 5 players, there is too much downtime (particularly with 5 where the total game length also becomes too long).

Also, and going against the current here, I am still undecided on whether I prefer the family version of the game, or the full version with cards. The cards do add a lot to the game, in particular variability and depth, and as a result an almost infinite replayability. On the other hand, they also introduce more downtime, and they add a significant amount of randomness to the game. Every single game I have played with the cards have seen one player triumphantly play strong (almost unbeatable) combos, and at least one player has been loudly cursing his bad luck.

I'd describe the family game as a regular, proper medium/heavyweight euro, if one that has a tendency to become a bit stale and dry with repeated playing. The full game, on the other hand, doesn't really feel much like a euro. The core game is the same, of course, but the cards takes the game clearly out of euro territory.

One of my favorite games - great theme and gameplay.  There is something even philosophical about the game and how it reflects the rat race of life.  The game isn't supposed to be easy - because the lives of farmers is not easy, and early game, you are just scratching by to make ends meet as you invest for the future.

Besides the thematic and philosophical angles, much of the fun in the game play comes from the delicious tension of trying to feed your family while both growing your family to get more actions and maximizing points for end-game scoring.  There are game theory elements and considerations of macro-level impact for any action taken or benefit gained.

Highly replayable due to so many cards and different combination of cards.  Drafting for the game is one of my favorite parts (that is when you get to dream).  Much, much better than Caverna.

A game that is really only for those ready for a bit of work (the good kind). Although the family version is a possibility, the real game is revealed when you include the cards.

Tight mechanics and brutal scoring ensures that only the strong will survive (and enjoy).

Misery Farm Simulator! WOO HOO! After about ten plays, I finally am getting past the "complete garbage" skill level. The game is honestly very simple. It's just a straight-forward worker placement game, but it is just SO TIGHT that you need to plan and be as efficient as possible. 

Be nice to newbies when you're teaching this one! I've seen too many people get turned off when the player that is teaching them the game has played 50 times and just slaughters them without offering any help.

I like it and can see why it is rated highly. 

Pros:
Occupations/Minor Improvements are the reason to play this game and they are easy to create expansions out of
A balanced strategy is best however this ensures you'll always be competing for action spaces with other players


Cons:
Setup and Maintenance are killer
Some moments can cause AP
Newbies likely won't get everything that is going
on until after 1 or 2 plays. I would highly recommend the Family Game and follow it up with just the E deck for newbies

Fun little game after a few plays.  A lot of bits to keep track.  Not as intimidating to learn as I first thought with so much stuff, because the action cards show you how to play.  A lot of depth to the game with it's many options it provides.  Solo play is easy, so not as fun with more people affecting your actions. I do enjoy it, but the set up and tear down makes me keep this from being a perfect 10.

Rulebook is awful.

Agricola is an outstanding game! At first I didn’t like it very much, but each time I play it the rating goes up. The mechanics are easy to grasp but the strategic decisions needed to win are very complex.  Plays very well with 3,4 and 5 players.

It is the best work placement game out there.

I love the family version of Agricola, the advanced deck versions? I don´t like as much. In Agricola you have to really think to win a game, so I dislike the luck present in the game when you add the cards. They can easily (powerful occupations) tip the balance to the players who drew better cards. I liked it better when all players had exactly the same tools to compete. I have not played yet the draft mode so the jury is still out on this one, but right now I really prefer Caylus over Agricola.

I finally tried the draft variant and I really liked it. I still think there are over and under powered occupations and minor improvements, but in a way the draft controls the annoying luck. If we are going to play with cards, I demand to play a draft. The downside of doing that is the extra time (around 45 min) needed to do it (with further aggravation from the analysis paralysis folk).

Agricola`s rating continue to raise after every play. Now I fully appreciate what a great game Agricola really is. Many of my new matches have been with 2 players and the game handles that perfectly, there is so much to do with so little actions, you always feel you can’t get done all the stuff you need to do, I love it.

The cards are absolutely amazing, every game is different and I have not played with an expansion yet.

Great great game. You have to play Agricola soon.

Nowadays I still like Agricola a lot, and I plan to buy it in the future (I have not yet done so because so many friends already own it). I still think it is the best worker placement game out there, I´m downgrading its rating because I’m re rating most games so they match the BGG recommendation system with my feelings for each game, in that light Agricola is an 8.5 to me. A very good game that I want to play almost always.

For me, Agricola continues to be the best worker placement out there. I love it and I think this will never change. My SO also loves it and request it often.

Last year Caverna was released and many bggeeks think it is better than Agricola but I have a different opinion. Caverna is less tense, has an static setup, it is more expensive and feels repetitive very soon. IMO, Agricola is miles better than Caverna, the main reason are the cards. I feel the cards are what makes Agricola special, highly replayable and easily expandable. Without them Agricola becomes a generic worker placement game (like Caverna). The secondary reason is the feeding of your family, in Agricola is much more harder (more tense) than in Caverna, a huge plus for me.

Another common criticism Agricola receive often is that it makes you take a predetermined path to win, but I have found this is not the case at all. With the cards you can pursue any strategy you want. For example I have this friend and he never kills animals for food (he is a vegetarian) but he does quite well in our games. I also have won games with wooden huts and without cows or grains or with many unused farm spaces etc. Agricola´s strategy is very flexible.

Great production values, furthermore with the later editions that came with the animeeples.

I finally broke down an bought the game, along with all the expansions I could find. I’m a bit worried support for this game is diminishing as Caverna took over but they recently released the France Deck so I hope this is not the case.

Nowadays, I vastly prefer to play it as a 2 player game but I won’t say no to a 3 or 4 player game, mainly because I get to see more cards that are unavailable in the two player game. As a 5 player game, I find the game has a lot of downtime so I almost never play this way (and I can’t imagine a 7 player Caverna game :shake:).

Bottom line, Agricola is the best Worker placement I have ever played. I have played it more than 50 times and I’m not tired of it. I love it.

Amazingly addictive Euro-hybrid.  Swinginess of the starting hands can be a problem.

Been doing some thinking about variability in the number of players and how resource scarcity affects the game, and am struck by how difficult the cards make this problem to attack.  The game will appeal to a lot of PR fans but I think it is much deeper strategically, if a little more limited tactically.  I see basic principles but I don't see truly dominant strategies akin to building/shipping in PR.  Agricola might be the best and most replayable Euro of this generation.

I'm close to 100 plays in now, probably.  Yet recently I saw a combo that I'd not only never seen before, but of a type I'd never seen before.  (Patron-Educator to get out all occupations before end of Round 4.)  That's what keeps me coming back to this game again and again.

It's a brilliant design and I'm pretty sure it sets the bar for all heavy euro games to this day.  It's just so sleek in its basic mechanical design and then goes above and beyond in including all of the cards and modular set up.  A true classic of the hobby.

I've added the Legen*dairy deck and the Belgium Deck.  Also a pnp copy of Through the Season, and the 4 Convention Cards.

Now, it's my favorite of the top 3.

Now that it's availible, I can play this again. 

I got destroyed back in Geek Con 2007...interesting game, feels like a farm sim--which is what it is. :)

Lots of replayability. Love all the card combo possibilities, love that it plays solo (looking forward to trying that).

I wasn't wowed out of the gate (1 play, don't put much stock in that statement), but I see a lot of things I need to learn more about. 

I do wonder about your ability to catch up, but I'm interested in exploring the game to see what my final reactions to it will be.

RATING: 5
Played with five players. The only blemish I can see on this game is the importance of going first each turn. Last on the first turn guarantees that you get the fifth and tenth worst actions. Next to last is not much better. Combining the space for going first with the ability to perform a minor improvement assures that you will not be going first any time soon. In games of equals I wonder just how often the first two players on the first two turns win.

I played this a couple of times solo before I started keeping track of games played. I found the rule book to be one of the most difficult to follow compared to how simple the game actually is to play. Along with that I just didn't enjoy the game. If I ever get an opportunity to play the game with several people, I may have to revise my rating. But, until that opportunity comes up, I will stick with my current rating since I really didn't like the game that much.

2013-02-17 - The game has gotten a lot of plays (for me) but I'm not certain how much enthusiasm I have for it.  It eats up a lot of play space, has a longer setup time than a lot of other worker placement games, and is quite fiddly.

Still...the option for solitaire play is a big plus.  My oldest daughter also likes the game.  If I'm in the right mood, I'll definitely play and lose several hours to solitaire play.

Ok..this is worker placement (which I normally hate), but there's enough variation in the cards that it doesn't seem like I'm playing Excel.  I still hate the "I bought wood, so you can't buy wood" aspect of these types of games, but this is certainly the best of the bunch.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Still have mainly played this one by myself. I did get one play in with another person and overall I guess it's tough for me to comment on.  I actaully owned and played Le Havre before I purchased Agricola.  It's really hard not to compare it to Le Havre as there are many similarites between the two and overall the games have similar feels.  That said though my intial impression is that I like Le Havre a bit better.  For me Le Havre beats out Agricola as a single player game hands down.  Perhaps I felt it easier to update the offerings in Le Havre....a lame knock I know but it just seems like to often I forget or don't update one of the resources.  I've yet to play either of these games with my wife or core gaming group for that matter but I'm also thinking that I would have an easier time explaining and them accepting Le Havre.  Agricola when stripped to it's core is a very simple game.  There are however, a good number 
things to keep track of and a fairly complex scoring system leading to a steep learning curve for those who are not avid gamers.  

Having said all of this though Agricola is a great game!  After I get a few more game plays under my belt I'll revaulate it.

**A few more games in and gotta say it keeps me yearning for more.  It's surprisingly hard for me to find players for it.  I either get complaints about the time commitment or the lack of understanding.  My stance on those two complaints are as follows:  We can play three mediocore games in the time it takes to play Agricola or we can play one great game, and in terms of understanding it play as a two player or even on your own and by at least the second game you should have a real good idea of whats going on...it's really not that complex...maybe a lotta little things but if you can follow the print on Dominion cards and keep track of what's what I think you could play Agricola...perhaps not master it but at least have a general idea of what's going on.

Given the variances in occupation cards and minor improvements and number of expansions that have come out for this game I have a feeling that I'll be itching to play this game for years to come.  Really just so many possiblites that I doubt I'll see a clear path to victory for a number of games if at all.

On a final note I'm going to bump this game up.  No boardgame is perfect but this one is a masterpiece.**

Wow.  How did this game rocket to the top of the charts?!?  Agricola is a good game, yes... but greater than Puerto Rico or Power Grid or Caylus or El Grande?... I think not.

The game has some serious flaws.  Some items, when combined with the right occupations, make for unstoppable combinations, making the game almost broken.  The only redeeming factor is the sheer number of cards, which could easily have been trimmed back.

Take a game like Cosmic Encounter or Glory to Rome, multiply the ways to "adjust" the rules by 10, and you are only getting close to the game play in Agricola. Oh, NEVER play the game with someone who is prone to AP... by the final few rounds you'll be ready to shoot them.

A nice bonus is that Agricola includes rules for solo play, so I bumped my rating by a point.  But I'd still like to see a little more interaction... cattle rustling, anyone?  Gophers?  Random tornado?

And (because I like money games) I was disappointed that there was no economic system.  How do you pay for all those seeds to plant?  Where does the money come from to hire all those people and buy that equipment?  The use of resources is OK, but where's the cash?  "I work for food" just doesn't cut it for me.

Agricola is a game that I'll be willing to play anytime but it just doesn't give me that 'best of all time' feeling.

Still not deserving of anything higher than a '7'... and that's being generous.

I have to admit that when I first heard about board game about 'farming,' my very first response was a sensible one: turn around and walk away. To clarify as not to appear condescending, when I play a game, 'farming simulation' is not exactly what I have in my mind nor I can attest to that not majority of people would be either.

But with so much appraise that this game has gotten, I cannot help but try it out for myself. Being a very meaty euro game, the depth of strategy found within allowed me to overcome the 'farming 'theme - and actually transformed me to keep an open-mind when approach games with obscure themes since it can turn out to be a real gem such as this one.

What truly helped me to get into the game was how tightly theme was interwoven with the mechanisms - during game play, I rarely had to question rules to make sense of them since the reasoning behind was very themetic. For example, of course, if you cannot feed your family, you will go out begging for food and this will hurt your reputation (VPs).

And this might be a silly reason to like this game but animeeples are very nice touch. This is such a simple change, but seeing small white sheep meeples in your own farm is very heart warming. If this game did not come with them, I would have liked it a bit less (drop the score from 0.5 to 1?)

This game certainly lived up to any expectations I had - a superb worker placement that forces you to adjust your plans depending what others do with their workers.  It scales REALLY well from 1 to 5.  The family version plays wonderfully, while the addition of cards provide nice alternatives.  While I still prefer Caylus, this game is good enough to also receive a 10.

RATING: 6
Rated after one play of the "advanced" version. 

Plusses: Very nicely interwoven mechanics and challenging gameplay; obviously a great deal of thought and playtesting went into this one. 
-The sheer number of cards to choose from assures continuing variability in individual strategy and tactics. 
-Rewards optimal planning and use of variable starting resources.

Minuses: Theme is tissue-thin. Not really an issue for quick and light games, but a longer and heavier game benefits immensely IMO from a well-matched and interesting theme.  
-Some concern about impact of starting hand. Certain card combinations were clearly more synergistic than others. May not be a major issue over the long run. 
-No real player interaction beyond the possibility of taking an action desired by an opponent. While the 1 person/action limit does introduce the need to take into account what other players might do, that dynamic typically plays out as securing an action you need and for which you believe you will be competing with an opponent. Actions are too precious to use them primarily to harm another player. 

Overall: An impressive effort that unfortunately just wasn't much fun to play. I felt as if I was solving a very complex but rather dry puzzle. Others in my group are agog over it, so I'll likely have additional opportunities to play and perhaps revise my rating. Maybe there's fun in there I haven't yet found.

UPDATE: After 3 plays the rating of 6 is pretty  well confirmed. After thinking about what aspect of the gameplay I found less than satisfying, I came to the conclusion that is was the fact that the heart of the game,  the many  different cards, all consist of exceptions to the rules. This strikes me as a rather inelegant way to achieve replayability and variety. I also think it contributes to the "multi-player solitaire" feel of the game. With 30 or more "special powers" in play, it becomes almost impossible to keep track of who gets what benefits in which situations, thus making it much harder to factor in opponents' possible strategies when making your own moves. I much prefer a game in which offers a greater scope for anticipating opponents' plays and countering them in ways that still benefit you.

An ok game. I bought into the hype. So I was disappointed in my first few plays. Non gaming friends liked it better then I did. Of cousre I was the one to explain all the rules. I do like all the professions, the minor improvements. It does work. But by the time the game reaches its conclusion, I am just begining to make a good farm. I keep getting sid tracked and chaning my plans throughout the game. Would I buy it again? Nope, but I will keep playing, mostly solo, maybe I can start feeling better about this purchase.

In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?

RATING: 10
I absolutely love this game.  I've heard that some people dislike the struggle to get everything you need or want.  But the game is about farming in the 14th century, not about being a multimillionaire in the 21st.  Many choices in this worker placement game, along with the cards, create a deep game with much replayability.  Only reason it doesn't get out more is my wife isn't too fond of it.  

Purchased the Belgium Deck recently, albeit begrudgingly.  Agricola, I think, is a game that I'd rather enjoy purely in its original state.

The game is easily teachable to youngsters; my six-year-old boy is pretty good.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a solid worker placement game.  It really is tight and cut-throat competition for worker placements, however multiple successful strategies leave it well balanced.  I actually find the farming theme rather fun because it's personalized and better than other traditional euro economic themes (gather resources, produce goods, ship goods, repeat).  

Gameplay can grow cumbersome, so it's best to encourage thinking ahead and keep it moving.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game if you like medium or heavy euros. Unfortunately, it takes a major effort to explain or understand the full rules before the first game, so picky players will have a poor first game experience.

Three plays in - I feel like it hasn't quite clicked for me. Lots of pieces, lots of space required. Kind of fiddly. 

I'd imagine my rating will go up once we start using the more complicated cards and the interactions between them become apparent. 

6-15-9

Still fiddly. We've played with more of the cards, and as I suspected, I'm enjoying the game more and more. Huge amount of variety in each game. I feel like many of the cards are not particularly useful unless you happen to get other complementary cards. 

Increased my score to an 8.5. Seems to play well with all numbers, but I particularly enjoy two player.

Agricola is a well-designed game with an impressive balance of accessibility and complexity. You are constantly faced with a variety of options and have to make careful and timely decisions to execute your long-range plans. It is fairly fast-paced for a game with this kind of depth, but it feels a bit repetitive and fiddly. Not a theme I'm crazy about, but a good game overall.

After my first game, I thought: what the hell is this? Took me a few games to get acquainted to. Great deal of fun. You have so many options to choose from.

Challenging game with endless replayability thanks to the occupations and minor improvements. Extremely satisfying to see your farm grow over the course of the game!  

Recent plays have lessened my love for Agricola because of how straightforward the decisions are and how important turn order is. That said, it is still a great game that I will gladly play pretty much anytime.

As I play this more and more it grows on me. I started out rating this a 5, but after more plays I rate it higher. (it's also much more fun playing with animeeples and vegemeeples!) 
A downside is that there can be a tendency for poor choices to snowball into a frustratingly unrecoverable situation which takes away the fun of the game, however there are also a lot of interesting strategies and possibilities to be discovered. I think this game will continue to grow on me.

BEST GAME EVER! Can appeal to pretty much anyone! Varying complexity levels help to attract a broader range of players from casual to experienced board game players. You will still have a moderate learning curve for those which are novice to the world of board games. I would open with easier games, even though Agricola boasts an introductory difficulty. In any case, I love it! Go buy it! NOW!

11.11.2007: Rated 9. I'm looking forward to an English version of this. I liked it a lot, and I think the replay value will be high due to the large amount of cards.

??.??.2007: I'm a bit  worried that the interaction might be too low, so I lowerered my rating to 8 for now until I try it again. However, the downtime was quite low and it played faster that I expected, so that's a plus.

14.7.2008: I've increased the rating to 8.5 after a first play with the E card deck. It's good and you want to play it again afterwards. But I'm still a bit worried about the lack of interaction between the players.

Initially game seems good and sort of thing I like.  Lots of different choices and not enough time to choose all of them.  Also lots of choices and it's often hard to exactly measure all of them.  I have a sneaking suspicion however that the game will not hold up to repeated plays without feeling hollow.  I'm blaming the scoring system that forces you to try and grow you family and spread yourself around.

I gave this away as it was popular and it always took too long

RATING: 10
(2nd English edition w/Z-deck) Solo and 2-3 player games...  For now I prefer the more direct and fair approach of the cardless 'Family' game, though the options and randomness in the carded 'Full' game only add to its future re-playability.  I have since 'pimped-out' this game with farmer/animeeples and vegi/resourcemeeples... and yes, Agricola is well worth the added expense.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Points are awarded based on the development of your farm -- but the way you develop the farm is determined by the randomly dealt occupations and improvements you get. But a bad deal or someone getting ahead will make it too hard to catch up and take away some of the enjoyment of the game.

PLUS: different cards at different levels means you will get lots of variety from just the base set
MINUS: no way to stop someone getting too far ahead, manual has text too small for some adults to read

I recognize that it's a better game than the rating I've given it, but using the BGG scale, that's where it falls for me.  Sometimes it just feels too much like work playing this game.  Not quite as bad as Caylus, but close enough.

This cost me a lot of money but it's just far well worth it.

Nicely designed game of farm development. Take an action, acquire some resources or derive some other benefit, trade in resources for improvements. Several little mini-systems can get going and become self-supporting if you do it right (e.g., sowing fields to generate crops to feed your family). I was dealt only a couple minor improvements and occupations that I could really take advantage of, and a couple of others whose benefits I didn't understand until later in the game when it was too late. 

This game will have immense replayability for its fans because of the innumerable combinations of cards. I thought it was decent, but it didn't bowl me over. Nowhere close to matching the hype.

It wasnt until the summer of 2013 that I unlocked the magic of the this game...it is brilliant. I have played it before though, but with 5 players. That experience is horrendous. Dont do it. 5p agricola lacks tension, lacks excitement, lacks a clear strategic path. And all it adds is downtime. up to 20 minutes of it. But try it 2 or 3 player. It is brilliant!! The game is in the cards

RATING: 9
Perfectly balanced, meaty strategic game.  The resource competition is cutthroat, but fair, as there is usually always another way to do things.  Various card decks give the game nearly infinite replayability.  Your brain will be working overtime, but I think that is a good thing.

Worker placement game with cards that create impressive complexity and almost infinite variation from one game to the next. This game feels more finely balanced than Caylus and without any of the useless actions or "favors".

While some hands can be more advantageous than others, I love having to adapt your strategy every game to what you've been dealt.

RATING: 9
Agricola deserves what it is held for - one of the best games out there to date!

There is some tight playing required if you like that way, but you can also relax and have a family game from time to time. The sheer variety of cards let you have a different strategy each time, so the game does not get repetitive (if you do not play everyday, mind you ;)

Clever mechanics and nice components. Go, Uwe!

The game is too harsh. You really feel the struggle through each round due to your limit or scarce resources. You wan t to do everything but you cannot. It is a really sad game. In the end I decided to let it go because after each game ended it didn't really make me feel satisfied or happy. Also I didn't win any of the games  (we played about 5 times)

Probably my favorite (but not my friends' favorite, so it doesn't get played much here.  The complexity, strategy, length, doesn't get drawn out.  All perfect for me.  The worker placement game type was new to me when I first played this and I fell in love immediately.

Update 6/13/17:  Has fallen a bit over the years.  Just don't want that much of a headache when playing a game, and sometimes staring at those 14 cards on top of everything else almost feels like a chore.

Muy buen juego, incluso en su versión básica. Sus cartas lo hacen prácticamente ilimitado.

En cuanto al juego, se trata de mejorar tu granja, mediante nuevas habitaciones, tecnologías, animales y vegetales.

En el tablero principal los jugadores pelearán por los distintos recursos para sus granjas, siempre teniendo en cuenta que necesitan tener comida para pagar al final del turno.

Very good game, even at its basic version. Its cards make it practically unlimited.

Talking about the game, you have to upgrade your farm getting new rooms, technologies, animals ang vegetables.

In the main board, players will fight for moving the resources to their farms, always having in mind they will need to pay food at the end of the turn.

RATING: 7.5
Reminds me of several other games, e.g. worker placement of Caylus and the unchosen actions getting more attractive by stuff being put on them as in Puerto Rico, but it still feels fresh. Like a good cube pusher Euro, it has that anxiety of 'so much to do, too little time' and 'will I get stitched up by someone else choosing the action I want if I don't choose it now?'. As for the language level, I would say that the family version is still playable for someone not knowing German if Melissa's excellent translations are used, but for the full game you really need a card translation if you don't know German (luckily I do know enough to get by ;)). My first impression is that the family version is still well worth playing though, and despite the language barrier it would probably be easier introducing the family version of Agricola than e.g. Caylus to other players. See my review for more details.

The variability of the cards really appeals to me.  If it wasn't for that the game would be strictly average.  I would like it a lot more of a game could be finished in less than 2 1/2 hours.

RATING: 4
UPDATE: 2.14.15 (cleaned up comments)

Agricola is a well-themed, engine building affair of balancing priorities and efficiency over a set number of rounds. There is variability in the cards, tension in feeding your family, and frustration when others inadvertently take actions you want. At it's best it is a challenging activity that I do not mind participating in once a year. However, I don't care for the random card draw, engine-building, indirect player interaction, and that the game funnels everyone down the same path via its negative point model.

OK, I will violate my own rules and rate a game here after one play for the first time, given that first play was at EuroQuest over nine months ago and I have had no burning desire to play or purchase this game, that should give you some idea how I feel about this game.  It's way overrated, nowhere near as good as the "best of class" of Essen 2007, which in hindsight are Tribune, Kingsburg and Container -- three games that for some reason haven't hit the top 100.  By contrast to those very innovative designs, Agricola offers nothing new or innovative in the way of mechanisms (feels alot like Caylus), the components are surprisingly inferior (i.e., why not at least have a picture of a sheep on the item that's a sheep, a la Zooloreto?), and the 66 cards in the "basic" deck mean there's a steep learning curve and obviously a huge alot of luck in the initial card draw which kind of dictates your approach to the game.  Also, I was distressed at the lack of alternate strategies, seems to mean the main goal is to feed your people and then expand with stuff to fill all 15 spaces, again nothing new or exciting here.  Finally, there seemed to be little reason to have three types of food or three types of animals, it just made the endgame scoring go much longer than necessary.  So, in summary, why didn't I like this game more?  Three things:  1 - lack of innovative mechanisms  2 - apparent lack of alternate strategies (note this is something that may not be the case if I played it more or with some of the other decks, perhaps) 3 - lots of randomness in starting card draw that could skew the outcome, in addition, there was a 4 - steep learning curve and 5 - too long and fiddly and complicated for what it purports to be:  a simple farming game.  

Updating the comment but not changing the ratings after a couple of more plays (including my first "win") in late 2008, almost a year after the first very dissatisfying experience.  With the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, I wish my initial play had been with just the "Family Game" without the cards; scores would have been lower, but gameplay would have been much quicker.  I think taking the cards out of the equation makes the game alot less luck-dependent, maybe enough to push my rating one spot higher to a 6; but since most people are enamored with playing with all those cards (lucky or unlucky, depending on the draw), I have to stick with my initial rating of a 5.  

Bottom-line:  No way this game should be #1 or rated up there with the greatest Euros of all time, like PR, Die Macher, or Power Grid.  The collective viewpoints of the cogescenti on BGG have got this one all wrong, IMHO.

I really must play this more. I have enjoyed it when I did.

It is a little odd as has been pointed out that when one farmer chooses to plow his field no one else can etc. (Or collect wood, or breed or whatever) Whole area covered by the game must be a commune and they all share everyting is the only explanation I can come up with.

RATING: 6.5
Micro-management, limited actions and worker placement.  I guess its fun to build your farm, but its just so tedious in doing it!   This really is a logistics game - long strings of actions are required to get anything done and if you mess up the planning then you are stuffed.  The scoring system means that there seems to be only way way to victory - the most 'balanced' farm (with a small amount of variation) - this is not a genuine 'multiple paths to victory' game.  Very unforgiving of mistakes.  Finally, the player interaction in Agricola is purely through the worker placement mechanism.  As such, the ONLY reason why players interact is to block other players from doing their optimal move.  That is, your turn is purely an optimisation exercise in finding the move which strikes the best balance between what benefits you the most and your opponents the least, and often that will mean simply messing up your opponent's plans rather than progressing with your own plans.  Compare (for example) Settlers Of Catan, where player interaction is largely through trading, where both players involved benefit from the deal.  Personally, I find blocking games to be far more annoying and downright nasty than games which involve direct combat (Small World, Mare Nostrum etc).  Stone Age is another worker placement game but its much more forgiving so blocking does not play such a large roll.

It was fun, but I enjoyed Puerto Rico much more (I tried both of these for the first time on the same night). Might've been due to starting with the K (complex) deck for my first play, and after 5 hours of previous gaming to boot. Would like to try this one again though.

Played it a 2nd time, this time with the E&I deck.  I enjoyed it a lot more this time. I like the wonderful attention to detail and homages of the art of the game - like the boardgames in the family rooms, and the stone carrier who is clearly of the Obelix persuasion.

Who cares how you pronounce it, and yes it's about farming -- but [-]Agricola[/-] The 'Gric is actually pretty fun. I love the variability the cards offer and it scratches the CCG itch as well. I still think if you changed the theme from farming to spice harvesting on Arrakis, you might have an AT claasic. Best of all, it's the first time I've seen the Euro crowd complain that a wooden cube is not good enough. Animeeples...

Some are the occupations are nuts, and you really have to keep your eye on everything in this game since over specialization leads to major minuses in the end scoring.

Fiddly with a huge initial learning curve, plenty of analysis paralysis, and a long setup/teardown time. My group will never play this. All that being said, it has plenty of depth and replayability.

Recently I have purchased a plastic organizer where I placed the common game components like the rooms, animals and resources. This simplifies the setup time greatly. Also, I sorted out the player components into bags. Now I simply give each player a bag. Without this method, the game would be far too fiddly to play very often.

After a number of games, I've come to the conclusion that there are two main factors that dictate strategy. What is everyone else doing, and what occupation and minor improvement cards you have.

Since everything but the cards are open, what everyone else chooses to do will strongly influence what you will do. In general, you do not want to be building your economic engine in the same fashion as another player at the table. If you are synchronized and follow the other player, you will likely be blocked from performing the same moves.

It is my strong impression that cards are not balanced. I sense that a skilled player with the right set of Occupation and Minor Improvement cards will rule a game. I think we'll have to move to card drafting variant in the future. But of course, this will make games even longer to setup.

Ultimately, I find that getting more workers as soon as possible is usually a very useful strategy. It is also the easiest way to score 3 points.

I just played my 20th session of Agricola, after letting it sit for a few months. Here's my revised comment. 

[b]Quick Overview[/b]: You begin Agricola with a two-room house, an empty farmyard, and a husband and wife determined to develop the land and start a family. You play 14 turns. During these turns, each family member takes a single action. These actions include collecting resources from the commons (wood, clay, reed, fish, stone, grain, boar, cattle, sheep), building improvements on the farm (new rooms, renovating old rooms, fences for pasture, plowing fields, digging wells, constructing ovens, and fashioning lots of little improvements like spindles, axes, etc.) and lastly, learning new occupational skills / hiring help (becoming a stone-mason or a baker, hiring a wet-nurse, etc.). There are three full decks of cards for "minor improvements" and "occupations," and players are dealt a selection of 14 at the start of the game. Sounds incredibly rich and fun, right? Well, sort of. 

[b]The Upkeep[/b]: At intervals throughout the game, there are harvests when you accrue grain and veggies from the fields and breed more livestock in the pastures. During these harvests, you also have to feed your family. As your family grows, you can accomplish more on the farm, but you have to provide more food. The additional labor would quickly outpace the relatively small increases in the food requirement, allowing players to create a thriving, bustling farm too quickly, so the designer of the game decided to make the harvests come at irregular intervals. This makes no thematic sense, and is purely for game balance. The first harvest occurs after four turns, the second after three, the third, fourth, and fifth after two, and the sixth and final harvest after a single turn. The more productive your farm gets, the more pressure the game applies. 

Consequently, most of your efforts in Agricola are spent on subsistence farming. You save the occasional resource boon for a small step up. Progress is slow. The need for efficiency cannot be overstated. The name of the game is finding out how to accomplish more with fewer actions. There is little room for error. I find that my enjoyment of the game depends directly on whether or not my hand of cards enables a baking strategy. Grain is one of the only things you can begin working on early in the game, and a solid baking strategy means you've kicked the upkeep early and play around a bit more for the rest of the game. The most fun I've ever had with Agricola was incredibly card-dependent. I had the baker (occupation), the baker's oven (minor improvement) and the riding plow (minor improvement). Once the upkeep was history, I actually got to, you know, play.  

[b]Final Impression[/b]: And that's too bad. Agricola is a well-designed game. What sours me on it a bit is that it looks like there's a rich interplay of resources - lots to build and lots of cool stuff to do with it. Not really. Agricola is more like a grueling obstacle course. When I play it I feel less like I have creative options and more like I'm worried about stumbling. There's undeniable reserves of variation in the cards, but the end-game scoring conditions make every game feel much the same. It's a matter of getting a stone house "just in time." One of every animal "just in time." Covering your last empty fields "just in time." I'm frankly surprised that this has achieved the broad-based appeal that it has. Gameplay here is rigid, painstaking, and difficult. I don't get much of a rush from it. The only reason I've rated it a six is because I really enjoy a small subset of games if my opening cards allow me to do certain things. Balance isn't the problem - I realize players can usually do well with different hands. Ultimately I may trade this away, vegimeeples and all.

This is a fun game. I find the 'advanced' game to be a bit too slow without gaining many interesting decisions. People get caught up thinking about the cards they have. The cards also add a bit more luck and chaos to the game. I definitely prefer the 'family' game.

The theme is very strong, which I think appeals to many non-gamers. Even though good play is not totally obvious people have a hard time making truly bad decisions as long as someone reminds them about the need to feed people, and the importance of some kind of food-engine.

This is a *very* good game.  Unbelievable tension is generated, especially towards the end, and repeated plays are much rewarded.

Update 23rd April 2011: This game gets better and better.  Upgraded to a 10 since always wanting to play.  The turning point came after about 20 plays when it opened up into a superb game.  Anyone who thinks this is multiplayer solitaire hasn't played it enough.  Never played with drafting rules and yet to see a game won purely because of the cards dealt.

**Update* really enjoying this game - the cards really add longevity. I try not to overplay any of my games and avoid strategy articles if I can, so i can see myself playing this one for a long long time to come.

**Update** Theme is a little weak, and have put off teaching this to family due to complexity issues. Still enjoy the game, but would prefer Puerto Rico if given the choice.

I Like:
*The cards - lots of replayability
*The theme is surprisingly engaging (must be somthing wrong with me!)
*The game makes sense in a 'real world' way and therefore is quite simple to explain to new players.

I Dislike:
*AP prone players will kill this game - don't play with them!

This game is just extremely unfun for me. It seems that the game doesn't like you and really would rather if you didn't play it. If you do have the misfortune of playing it then make sure to do everything just the way it wants you to or else it will slap you across the face and call you bad names. 

There are no "good" decisions, just ones that are slightly less painful then other ones. As I watched the players across the table from me, the only sounds coming out of their mouths were groans of pain and agony. I usually like fun games so this one is not for me but hey if you like suffering then you have found the one, MISERY FARM.

We bought this game for the farming theme and have not been disappointed.  One of the best things about it is the endless variety of play because of how many cards come in the base game.  The game does require some pretty heavy thinking though as the tension between expanding your farm while feeding your family is very tight.  You can relax a little bit when you have a good system going particularly if you have been lucky enough to find a good combo in your starting card selection.  Nevertheless, we always end up needing some scrap paper to jot down what we ideally want to do over the next round or two.  All this thinking time does add a lot to the overall game time.  Most games are very satisfying though as you transform your farm from empty land to fields and pastures and your farm house from wooden hut to stone mansion. (Or bigger hut - lol)

Great game.  Tough worker placement game.  Probably the best I have played to date.  The fact that it's hard to get food at the start really keeps you on your toes.  Lots of strategy and competition.
If you don't like high pressured games, I would recommend Caverna instead.
I personally don't like to play with 5 players as it really slows down.  I think three players is great, but works well with two and four also.
We often card draft to take away the randomness.  Does add time on to the game length though.
To keep the game flowing it does really require players to think ahead whilst others are taking there turn.  Perhaps this is true for all games......
Modern classic game.  Perhaps it isn't as good as Go.

After only one play of the solitaire game I need much more. There are so many things to do in this game, but they all creep up to you very slowly.  I think this is a game that will be easy to teach to newbies, but will satisfy the needs of the more experienced players in our group.  Can't wait to play this some more!

Edit 09/09/08
WOW!!  This game IS better than Puerto Rico.  So many elements of so many games all packaged into one seamless little system. It's beautiful.  Everyone I have played this with has wanted to play again; immediately!  And this is only the family version.  There's so much to do and think about, I can't wait to introduce the cards into the mix.  Just stunning.  A well deserved victor and certainly the best game I've ever played.  
  the only element that is missing is player interaction or combat.  But the way the actions are chosen, you feel like sometimes yo uare steeling from another player.  This will get many many more plays, and I fear that Puerto Rico will begin collecting dust.

Edit 01/10/08
Have now played nearly a dozen games ranging from 2 to 5 players.  This game is a corker!  It's only limitation, that I can see, is that when very experienced players play against each other, then everyones strategies will collide.  And the game will then come down to who is the luckiest when they take the starting player.  But I think that's pretty minor.  further, I have seen a good strategy beat a VERY strong hand.  So the cards do not necesarily swing the game.  they help, but they're not everything.  This game is AWESOME!

Edite 19/11/09
After nearly 4 months since my last play I have no choice but to drop my rating of this game.  It's too long to get any sort of regular play in and takes far too long to explain to people. Stone age is now my top choice.

Our second ever purchase.

While I enjoyed this game,  my wife did not take to it. She found the game to be remarkably similar from play to play (always wanting for wood at the beginning, rushing to expand the family as soon as possible, etc., etc).  There's not really a  variety of strategies to be played here - even with the cards -  it's mainly only the order of events that change from game to game.

All of which taught me an important lesson about luck when it comes to games to play with my wife. It's not that she doesn't think strategically, it's that with games such as this where there is little to no interaction between players, there is no outside influence to interfere with your plans. Yes, you can put your family member into a space before I do - but that really isn't going to break the game for me. At least with games with dice or other luck-based mechanics, there's the possibility that I'll have some terrible rolls, or hers will be great, and she'll get the upper hand.

It all comes down to the fact that we're supposed to be relaxing together playing "games". There are ups and downs and excitement when things are unpredictable - and that makes games fun for us. Playing Agricola doesn't have the excitement; isn't the kind of game that leaves lasting memories. In the end, for us it feels less like a game and more like an "excercise".

A really good game where you have to make a lot of interesting decisions. But it is intimidating and sometimes exhausting. There are so many options, starting with the 14 different cards for every player and every one of these can change the way you plan to develop your farm. When playing this game I often do not feel like I'm achieving or building something, but just struggle to survive the best possible way. And in every round I heard every player say at least once :"Mmh, I should have done this differently ...".
A lot of options, tough decisions, clever mechanics -> great game. I really like to play it, but would never play two rounds of it in a row.

Played solo and 3-player. I see what the hype is about. I REALLY enjoyed it. I feel the cards do shake things up and make every game different, but at the same time COULD give one player an edge over another. That said, I think the card variants at the end of the rulebook are sufficient to get around this.

I think the beauty of the game is that it has those clean euro mechanics and yet is dripping with theme. Rarely done in the Euro world. Kudos.

RATING: 9
Even playable solo but I like it best with 4 players. It's not unusual to struggle through the whole game and ending up with the feeling that you didn't accomplish much. So much the better is the satisfaction when a strategy works out and a game ends with a well-developed farm.

The strength of Agricola for me is the multitude of available cards for professions and acquisitions which make every game unique. A bad starting hand can decide the game against a player when the opponents are of equal skill.

I would choose Agricola over Caverna due to the variable cards anytime. I guess, many others prefer a more balanced, less random and learnable game.

RATING: 7
Otro juego económico. Tiene algunas mecánicas interesenantes como la asignación de trabajadores y la ocupación de las acciones disponibles, el incremento de familia (más acciones por ronda), la necesidad de dar de comer a la familia, la acumulación de recursos, etc. Se penaliza la sobre-especialización, tienes que conseguir puntos en todos los apartados. Las cartas de mejoras menores y profesiones hacen que las partidas sean distintas entre sí pero también más dependientes de la suerte. El número de rondas fijo y la necesidad de alimentar a la familia mantiene la tensión del juego. Es susceptible de analisis-paralisis y downtime (como la mayoría de juegos económicos).

UPDATE: cada vez me gusta más la versión familiar. Sin usar las cartas el juego es mucho más rápido y menos dependiente de la suerte.

Wow. Just played a two player family version. There's a lot to soak in. It was fun but dear lord was it hard to get from the instructions. We watched 2 different youtube videos after reading the instructions and had to read the instructions again afterward. It took us like 1.5 hours from when we had everything out of the wrap and when we finally finished the first move. And there was 14 more to do after that! It was an enjoyable game, but I'm just not as impressed as I should be. It's theme is just so-so, though I really liked the Animeeples for the livestock (just purchased new). For the third rated game on BGG, I was expecting to be blown away, not confused slightly bored. Maybe this will change when I update after playing with the included decks.

Update:  The app made this one a home run for me. Takes care of all the maintanance and I can play the game in a decent amount of time. I think the game plays better online because the game is stressful in person. As of now: Agricola if we are all hardcore gamers that play very fast, but Caverna in any other appropriate circumstance.

Next (and maybe final) update: This game has everything. At first glance from the uninitiated it is complex and has obtuse scoring. With repeated play, it is a masterpiece. No other game offers the same permutations of long term strategies, formed through the in-depth analysis, and preferably drafting, of cards. Tactical decisions and improvisation take over from the initial draft, and the game is a home run. The interaction is perfect, the expansions add infinity to infinity, and the theme is represented as well as can be within the confines of a board game.

Absolutely fantastic.  Wasn't convinced on my first game, scoring only 15 points (how embarrassing). I failed to appreciate how important it is to feed your family and felt pressured all game.  However, it has grown on me very quickly.  I play Puerto Rico and Power Grid plus a plethora of other games and heartily rate this a 10.  Fabulous 2 player game.  Fantastic with more.  What my gaming club loves is that it plays within 60 - 90 minutes no matter what.  There are lots of things to do and you have to have 2 or 3 options up your sleeve. The cards for the different decks are great but you should limit yourself to playing only 2 or 3 as we've found that you tend to waste family member actions on getting them out while other players get ahead by plowing fields, sowing, building fences, etc. Fun.

21Dec10 - Still love this game. What a fantastic 2 player! I like multiplayer too. We have become quite wary of the cards. You really can fall behind if you focus on them too much. 2 or 3 out over the course of play seems adequate.

3 Jan 13 - Have downgraded from a '10' to '7.5'. Still great but not playing it as much. One problem is that it's not easy to get the cards out if you're playing decks. Trying to get professions out, etc, will mean that you fall behind elsewhere.

22 Oct 14 - Haven't seen this on the table for a long time. Lots of newer games that we prefer. Shipyard, Stone Age, even good ol' Puerto Rico is better. Rate a 5.

I've gotten a ridiculous amount of enjoyment and value out of this game.  The decks keep the game fresh, and there are always interesting decisions to be made.

I enjoy this game a lot, but my fiancée would prefer to play Stone Age or Pillars. She thinks this game has too many things to keep track of and she feels frustrated that she cannot do everything she feels that she has to do in order to maximize her points. As time compresses in the game, she feels rushed and thinks she makes poor choices because of that. However, this is part of what I really enjoy about the game. This game is really growing on me, and I am working on convincing my fiancée that we need to play this more often. It has a good theme, lots of variety, and is a lot of fun. The only downside is the poor quality components, but there are plenty of third party alternatives available.

Now I dislike Agricola, but at first, I enjoyed it.  I don't care for the cards (some are so strong while others are fairly weak; I feel like drafting cards might be ok though).  I'd take a game of Caylus over it any time.

Great game. First play always requires a "teething" period.  It's hard to know what's a good thing to do your first time playing.  After that it's pretty acessable.

I love this game, and think it plays well from solitaire up to 5 players.  Not knowing what minor improvements and professions will be available in each game keeps replayability high in my mind.  The game can be a bit frustrating when the action one wants constantly gets taken, and the seizing the first player mechanism really helps with that.

I love creating my farm empire. This game feels less interactive than Puerto Rico, so although I gave them both 10's, Puerto Rico is preferred because your actions more heavily influence others. Of course, I haven't really played with the Interactive deck so I might take everything I just said back soon. A very fun game!

March 2017: 

Definitely for folks who wants to manage a lot of things at once. Has a few problems in the options available to players. Would never play this over Caverna.

I love the replayability in this one, and I'm a big fan of operations research / efficiency engine games. Not in love with action drafting, but overall this comes together very nice. Have to assume, that with the sheer variety of occupations and improvements, that card balance and luck of the initial draw will be issues in competitive play.

I'm feeling a whole lot of meh out of the gate. Initial rating: 5 for a 3-player learning game.

Update: 2nd game bumps this up to a 6, even though it was a verrry long 5-player learning game (3 brand-new players). I felt I got junk for cards and had to scrounge for subsistence the whole game. Still, there were moments there where I started to see why people like it. I'm hoping for experienced players and/or fewer players next time for a "better" read.

Update 2: After playing a four-player at the advertised speed (30 min/player), I'm not convinced I'll ever like this. This probably says more about me, my tastes, and my admittedly low competence in that kind of thinking ahead and synergizing.

Update 3 (12/11/08): Traded away. There are plenty of copies around, anyway, if I want to play this again, which I doubt I will.

Update 4 (1/31/14): Bought it again, enjoyed it better now that I'm not taking it as seriously. Bumping up rating to 6.

I see the reason Agricola is so well regarded, especially after grasping the idea that this is a game of maximizing efficiency.  I love the aspect of increasing complexity by starting out a beginner player with the family game then progressing to the cards at the various levels.  It also seems to be a different experience with each additional player.  I anticipated the solo version, but so far, have been a little disappointed that it is more of a puzzle to see how you can preselect the cards and get the most points.

Well done, but when it comes to worker placement games, I prefer Caylus and Le Havre. 

Update: I have had a bit of a change of heart on this one. I have come to really appreciate the variety the cards provide. I enjoy puzzling through all the intricate ways you can meet the relatively narrow set of objectives. Even though the game is deep and thinky, it also feels compact and accessible. I like the cohesive theme and charming artwork. It may well deserve being the highest rated worker placment game.

The sheer variety of potential game combinations far overpowers the slightly lower player interaction and tactical depth of Puerto Rico, making it a tough argument over best game of all time.

A classic game for the hobby. I don't really like how the game wants you to do everything, and specializing isn't really an ideal strategy. But it's a very tight, and tough game. And while it's the most popular in the Harvest series, I do have to say it's my least favorite. Still solid though.

RATING: 9
I was really surprised at how difficult the "family" version of the game was - it was a tough fight just to keep your family fed!  Agricola has a very fun theme which is well implemented.  As everyone says, the huge number of cards improves the long term replayability.  I guess the central mechanisms are not really anything new, but this seems to be my favorite "worker placement" game yet.  A hallmark of German-type games seems to be the situation of having so many things you want to do on your turn, yet so few opportunities to do it.  Agricola has this feeling more than any other game - I would imagine that the competition is very tight with experienced players.  I look forward to exploring this game further.

Update 2/08: This game has indeed proven its worth.  It has preoccupied my gaming group for months now, players often want to play again right after finishing to see what they can do differently the second time around.  I've also had success teaching it to casual gamers and even my mom and sister.

The cards definitely provide a lot of variety, but also the simple availability of resources/playing spaces.  Sometimes, due to turn order or other player's styles, you may be forced into a particular strategy that you did not anticipate.  

It is unusual to find a game this compelling - it's a definite winner and probably one of the strongest contenders of my 9's to become an eventual 10.

RATING: 2
Very mechanical, very fiddly, and a little overwhelming in the number of actions. Its very hard to see a clear path to victory because this game penalizes specialization and rewards doing poorly in different fields. It never feels like you get to enjoy advancing your farm (or managing it the way you want to) as you do rushing to take actions before someone takes them from you.

Honestly, I do feel the game is overhyped. For this sort of Caylus-style game, I still think Pillars and AOEIII are better examples of games in the genre.

[2 years later]
I think the problem I have with the game is that every player's strategy (if you want to win) is to do the exact same thing. Early game: get some occupations, get a new family member. Mid game: feed the kids, collect resources. End game: Fill up your farm with whatever you can. There is no variety in game plan. The tension is in recovering from what the other players do to you (by blocking your actions). As such, I still consider it a far inferior game to others like Le Havre.

After the first play: there is not much new to say about Agricola that has not been said, but I still want to put down my reflections. An amazing and awesome game although the theme is not appealing to me at all. But it is true, the gameplay is so engaging that you got to like the theme as well. I am so much impressed to see how well the theme is incorporated into the game and how many challenging decisions you have to make during the game. A lot of things to consider and keep in mind and plan ahead. After one play I feel I want to have repeated plays and start trodding on the learning curve of Agricola.
I have yet to see if this game can cause frustration or not, and if yes, how.  
A truly amazing design.

Our group has at least 15 plays of this now, usually with 4 players.  We have yet to use anything but the basic deck and are just fine with that. The extra decks are like a prebuilt expansion.

Most games are decided with less than 3 points, sometimes only 1 point with a tie at second.  There's a lot going on here, and it keeps us coming back.

Edit: We only don't play this as much now due to the growing collections of myself and another player.  We don't dislike it overall it just doesn't see much time anymore
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
As I've mentioned in other game comments, I'm not a huge fan of overly complicated non-sequitor rules, or rules without a wholistic feel to them. Agricola reminds me a little of Endeavour in regards to it's placement and resource management, but feels more unified and less abstract - My game group explained Agricola to me, and though the rules SEEMED abstract and "more of the same," I was up and running with a limited but planned breeding strategy about 15 minutes into my first session.

The game is a blast. It takes awhile to play - we were pushing 3 hours with 5 players, but at no point was I ever bored. The game also seemes to have enough random variety per session to maintain good long term play value. Agricola can be played competetively (ie. attempting to screw over the other homesteads by squating on resources they might need), but if you're not into that style of play, you'll also do just fine concentrating on gathering your own nuts and building your nest.

Some of the rules are headscratchers - 

For example, if you have plenty of wood resource, why are you limited to building only as many fences as your piece-count allows? If I have the actual wood resource, why can't I keep building?

And why do i have to wait until much later in the game in order to bunk up family members in the same house? Realistically, shouldn't that happen first?

I'd also think this game could benefit from a lite trading component (a la Settlers), but it's hard to tell how well that would work without it changing the gameplay substantially.

Meh. Minor quibbles with an overall great game.

Agricola also has a "family mod" which removes some of the more complicated elements (occupations and homestead improvements), and if you have little ones in your play group, i'd reccommend keeping it with this limted version. Regardless, the game teaches the value of planning ahead, organization, and management, and if you're also a teacher looking for a completely non-violent, constructive game for your classroom, I'd strongly consider this (just mind the heaps of cards and parts).

I was pretty overwhelmed when I played my first two games, and they took a long time.  In the third game, I played the "family" version with my wife and son and things came together a bit more.  In the first couple of games, I pretty much ignored the major improvements because they were too far away from me and the translation was hard to read (or missing).  I finally understood those cards.  I would definitely recommend playing your first game using the family game rules with fewer number of people (3 is pretty good).  It is good to get down the first couple of games using the family rules before tackling the occupation cards and the minor improvements.

Definitely a buy when the English version comes out.

So much to do but so little time! Our first heavy game. The wife enjoy sit but I am still 50-50 with this game as I feel every game ends up being the same where you generalise and get everything. 

I suspect I have not seen the error in my ways yet to fully enjoy it.

This has stayed at or near the top of my rankings ever since I first played it. I really enjoyed playing a bunch of solo games when I was first learning it. I enjoy the decisions and (to a point) the stress of trying to feed your family. It is an amazing system that feels different every time based upon your cards. I am far from really understanding this game.
I have begun playing in online as well, which has finally given me more opportunity to explore more cards and more player counts.

My first play lasted for over 3,5 hours with 4 players, but it didn't feel like that long. While playing I really started to notice what should have been done differently and where I did mistakes. Therefore I'm willing to play more. As a game system, mechanically and also thematically an absolutely strong offering. For newbies (to this game) it might be a hard experience to play with people who already have plays under their belts and the other problem might arise from the possible collectible future this game might have. That's a pity, because as such you already have almost endless gaming available.

RATING: 8.5
One of the finest Euros out there. There's so much going on and it works. It scales well. The healthy tension comes from trying to make as lovely as farm as possible, without enough turns or resources.

With more gaming experience, however, I do notice the small flaws and my rating has slipped [i]slightly[/i] over time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Great eurogame. Almost absolutely non-random. Has a good variability from play to play due to different cards you can use. The only issue (but for some people it is an advantage) is an unpleasant feeling of having to deal with harvest.

RATING: 5
Agricola was interesting the first few times I played it but I gradually got tired of the length and the overwhelming power of some cards relative to others. I would much prefer a deck of 30 reasonably balanced cards to hundreds of wildly unbalanced ones. I also think there is too much downtime. I now will only play if someone else insists. Among the Caylus style games I much prefer the original and Stone Age (a 9 and a 10 for me) because the decisions are quick, meaningful, and tactical whereas Agricola is slow and emphasizes long term strategy.

RATING: 4
I used to play this a lot because it was the only worker placement I knew for a while. However, discovering other WPs made me understand how terribly I hated this game, especially the feeling of despair that comes with it. It feels likes work, but not fulfilling work like I do at my 9-5 job, but terrible menial work, with pay so low I'm hoping to stay alive. Much, much too tight, and I hate playing for 2h before finally feeling like I'm ready to do something. This game should start on turn 10 and then end on turn 20: oh, that game already exists, and is named Caverna.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Even interesting in solitaire mode IMO (despite sometimes you are at risk of the card draw).

The one mechanic I dislike is the Starting Player token and turn order based on where you sit at the table relative to other people greatly affects your chances with the game. Especially when the person to your left is more likely to take starting player than the ones on your right.

I have had a hard time introducing this game to people due to length.

It also plays horribly as a 3 player game, as two people will probably conflict more than the other one (who will run away with it). Usually decided mid-game who will end up winning.

However in the last few 3 man games we have played that might not have been the case. Maybe it is because one of the 3 is still learning?

Still one of my favorite games to play, even as a solitaire game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is the ultimate worker placement game IMO.  There is always 1 extra thing you want to do every round that you can't and strategy has to be made flexible by heavy competition for spaces.  The huge variety of occupations and improvements will keep this game fresh for a long time to come.  And the addition of the wooden ani-/vegi-meeples adds tremendously to the feel of the theme/gameplay.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Still not sure about this one.  The game is enjoyable and challenging to play.  I think I prefer the family game to the standard game; I don't find the unlimited replayability the occupation and minor improvement cards offer to be important, because every time you'll have a different combo; I think it hinders strategic experimentation and learning that a more constrained set of variables could permit.

Started logging plays right after I got Agricola, which my wife really enjoys.  If the wife's happy, the life's happy.

Anyway, I enjoy it too, especially with the cards.  The cards just make it more fun, because you become something with every occupation, and you improve your house with every improvement...  it just feels more real, even though I'm horrible at it.

I was late to try this one considering its popularity.  Finally picked it up and we really enjoy it.  Lots of room for replay ability.  I might try some of the variants that have seen on BGG to balance the occupation cards by drafting instead.  Some that we have played with didn't enjoy the pressure to feed your people but I don't think it's enough to make me go the Caverna route yet.  I think this is a great one to have in my collection.

RATING: 6
I must be one of the very few people who isn't completely gung-ho about this game. Here's why: 

First: I always feel like I am just about to get really started playing this game when it ends (I happen to have the same issue with Puerto Rico - don't hit me! :p ). 

Second: It is so hard to play any of the cards due to a constant lack of resources. There are so many cards in this game and I feel you never really get to play them. 

Third: I absolute hate the artwork :) I disagree with the folks out there who say that artwork is not important, to me it is vital. Maybe because I'm a photographer and aesthetics count a lot for me (occupational hazard I guess). 

Undoubtedly a good game, but I happen not to like it a lot. I have my eye on Caverna, since it's supposed to fix a lot of the issues I have with Agricola (not so hard to feed your family / dwarfs), better artwork etc.

RATING: 7
Initial rating after playing the simplified game: 8. Almost surprisingly hooking given the theme. When playing with occupations and minor improvements I found it messy and unfair and less enjoyable: more like a big heap of random options and effects that you employ in your private race towards a favourable end state than a game like Puerto Rico where you constantly relate to the other players. It's easy enough to apply house rules or just play the basic game, I suppose. The theme is complete bullshit; for anyone with any knowledge of real-world farming this is comedy fodder through and through.

I want to like Agricola, I really really do. I like the individual elements of Agricola, I love worker placement, I love advancing the board as one goes along.

RATING: 9.5
well, some of his mechanics opened the way for really great games and it's brillant even today (2013). the interaction between players is minimum, it's just a race for common actions (like most games with a board for each player). it's perfectly coherent with his setting and is a really astonishing one. the score sistem is very cool and balanced, forces you to do a little bit of everything. cards are A LOT and you will never play a similar game. on the other side the cards are really too many to be balanced and some good combo allow a match of experienced players to be won by the one with better cards. that's a pity for a game that, otherwise, it's totally luckless. you can play the game without cards, but hey, it gets really stripped. these are flaws that i really feel because the game has a really long setupping and playing time. other that that... you're seeding your fields and you can hold a sheep in your house... could you not love it?

RATING: 5
Fantastic game - Definitely Placement of Caylus meets the planning and stress of In the Year of the Dragon.

A game that deserves the hype. Perhaps a drafting system would work to strengthen the cards you are holding would work nicely.  Initial Rating a 8.5

Update: Reduced rating to an 8 - Is it good? Yes. Is it great? I don't think so. All and all I think it is a future classic that most who consider themselves boardgamers should get. I do believe there is an inherent flaw designed into the game. It's the cards. It's not that one is more over-powered than the other, it's that the cards are different. Thus inherently as a player you will receive bonuses individual to only you throughout the game. 

Now, you could go ahead and do whatever strategy you like, and hope for the best. Or you can play toward the bonuses you acquired. If you did this you have a greater chance at winning the game, and so does everyone else who does this. It balances the game out - you have your benefits, and I have mine. 

The defect comes into play here. The "leading" for strategy - or being overly scripted. You are free to construct a different strategy than what you have - you just will not win. This makes the game too simple strategically. 

Tactically it is full of goodies - but is that enough to bring it past a good game. I say no. It must have both to be in the realm of greatness. I will enjoy this one - but it is not the best of the best.

Update: Wow - to fall so far so fast! It's a real shame but with the Strategic Leading it really kills this game for me. Every player has this basic strategy: Get more people and enough food to feed them for each Harvest. The other strategy is practically based on the cards you get - if you get the best set and can implement them the most efficiently you win! That's it and it's kinda boring. Rerated to a 6

Update: Played again - Boring! Just slow and mechanical. No thank you! Rerated to a 5

Good worker placement game. One of the prime examples of worker placement games.
It spawned tropes/recurring themes like "always have to feed your people", "getting more workers is the dominant strategy", etc.

I like the cards, they give the game a lot of variety and replayability. I dislike the cards because there are some absolutely bonkers cards in there but also a lot of very boring ones.

I like the game. But prefer pretty much any other worker placement game over this one.

Update 3: Have played this solo a number of times now. Obviously, this is one of my favorites, and being that I'd have a hard time having to choose between a game of the 'Gric and anything else, even my precious Struggle of Empires, I'm going to have to give this a 10. I just can't think of anything I don't like about it.

[Update: While I was reluctant to admit it, because there's no map, no armies, and no mayhem, this game is fantastic. It always feels exceptionally tight, and there are many, many paths to victory, most of which are available regardless of the card pulls, though those can have a serious effect. There are some deadly combos in here, though, so beware; one of the most interesting things about the game is that those cards and combos aren't necessarily the ones you expect - the Mendicant can be as powerful as the Wet Nurse, and watch out if someone finds a good way to turn clay into food!

An extraordinarily nuanced game, one of my GeekBuddies says in his review that it's the hardest he's ever played - and I concur. Packed into a fairly straightforward engine is complexity the likes of which you just don't see everywhere. The action drafting can be really tough - it's really painful when you think you know exactly what your opponents are going to do, and then they surprise you.

Another interesting thing about Agricola is the level of cockteasing that goes on with the cards. You usually only get to play three or four in any given game, so you keep wanting to play over and over again, just so you can finally land that plow or that occupation on the table...]

Well, OK. Now that I own this (albeit in German), I need to play it while stone cold sober.

DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT make the same mistake I did, and try this any other way for the first time.

There's not alot I can say that hasn't been said before.  I just love medieval farming.  Okay, so technicaly this is supposed to be Renissance farming, but I choose to pretend it takes place in the 1200s.  I am currently trying to figure a way in which I can incorporate games of Agricola into a medieval roleplaying strategy game my friends and I are playing...

With Farmers of Moor this is one of the best games out there.
Theme might be boring for some people, but mechanisms are brilliant.

Needs alternative rules for occupations and minor improvements as the game becomes a luck fest with normal rules.

I simply don't understand the people who complain about the point cap for every category in the game.
It's a brilliant rule that forces people to tackle all the problems and does not allow heavy exploitation of specific cards/mechanisms to enable a single winning strategy.
Also, it's the MAIN goal of the game; to have a DIVERSE farm. IMO It's quite silly to complain about that.

High replay value game. Worth every cent

What immediately stood out to me when I began through the rules the first night of owning the game was how well thought out it was.  The fact that there a few pages dealing with how each card operates specifically shows that lots of the kinks have been thoroughly worked through.  I really thought it was great how there is a family addition and the regular just by flipping one of the boards over.  This game is not something you play a few times and figure out.  It has more re-playability than any other board game I have come across so far while maintaining a great theme and engaging mechanics. 

I really feel like I got my money's worth with this game.  So much replayabilty!

A current favorite.  Huge replayability with all the occupation and minor improvement cards, and a tremendous depth of strategy.  You will have to plan ahead to do well, and it is very satisfying to pull off a move that has been many turns in the making.  Theme is not of particular importance to me, but I find the theme in this game to be aid in both its accessibility (enticing people to play the game in the first place), and as a mnemonic to help remember a lot of the intricate rules.

the main criticism i have read - that the scoring system does not encourage specialization and so everyone's farm looks alike at the end - i have not found to be true at all.  in my experience, typically you ARE specialized in something during the midgame (e.g. animal husbandry, baking), and then the endgame is a scramble to try and grab all those things you've been neglecting.  this creates and adds to the tension in the game since you're all competing over the same finite supply of resources.

Players compete to create the best farm. there are limited resources and workers must be managed.

There is also a random element in how resources become available and which occupations are available each game.

Somehow I got sucked into the BGG hype and ordered Agricola through the Z-Man preorder. After a few months of attempting to read the rules I was pretty worried I wouldn't like the game and even considered selling off my preorder. Fortunately I was absolutely wrong...dead wrong. This is the best game I've ever played and I honestly don't expect that to change. The game is so different and unique every time. I love trying to find ways to make perfect card combinations only to find out that the game is about one or two rounds too short for my plan.

Lowered rating. There are a lot of things I like about Agricola: the sense of building something up from nothing, the gardening/surviving theme, and the intricacies of the card effects within that theme (like being able to keep bees or trim hedges and thereby produce more food or create more enclosures). But the sense that I get when playing it is one of pressure to perform rather than a self-directed sense of accomplishment. Instead of being able to sit back and contemplate with pleasure the many options available, forming ideas about how to build up my little plot, every turn I feel like I'm just trying not to drown. The begging chips are just looming over me. And the negative points at the end for not having the proper variety of animals/crops does not cause me to do better than I would have or increase my enjoyment of the game. A good game should allow you to have a chance at winning using a vast number of different strategies, some of which the designer may never even have thought up. It should just work so well that it accommodates new and creative paths. So a vegan farm, or an all-sheep farm, or a family that has very little land but succeeds through barter, or one that makes its living through its members being specialists who entertain or provide services in town--all these should have an equal shot at victory. But with the rules the way they are, there seems to be just one "right" way for your farm to be at the end, and if you deviate from it, then woe betide you. For that reason, I don't enjoy Agricola as much as I enjoy other building-up games like Stone Age or [thing=278][/thing] Game. If you want something of equivalent weight, [thing=102680][/thing] is within a tenth of a point of Agricola's using BGG's rating system, but Trajan rewards you for the positive things you do rather than punishing you for failing to toe the line.

One of my first games and still one of the favorites. I'm one of those who really enjoys the desperate tension of having to have something of everything and the apparent lack of resources to get it. One of the best games out there for me.

A very fun, if complicated, game.  Teaching this game to other people takes a while (especially if you've only played it a few times yourself!), but once everyone gets the hang of it, it's a lot of fun. I always feel like the game is too short to allow me to fully realize my strategy.  I give it an 8 because of the steep learning curve and because it's almost impossible to keep track of everything you want to do between resource gathering, farming, animal husbandry, minor improvements, major improvements, and occupations.

An exercise in tedium. I kept trying ways other people said would improve this, but honestly, while I recognise there are plenty of decisions to be made it was so dull I didn't care.

Definitely needs more than one play to get the gist of it, if only for the reason that it's virtually impossible to formulate what's going to happen later in the game (even if you've read the rules and round cards).  Subsequent games improve this one dramatically.

Addendum:  I've played three times now and my rating has gone up each time.  It definitely needs to be played with the cards.  

I can see this going to 10 with more plays.  After each game I think about it for literally days (mostly about things I should have done differently).  Truly the sign of a great game.

Fun but very frustrating game - you will rarely, if ever, get the farm you want; it will always be incomplete. And this is the nastiest game I have - Every single move you make pisses off someone else. It's also quite hard to take advantage of the cards you get; sometimes things will go your way and you will get to use all those cool cards, but other times you will not be able to play them at all. Definitively a hard game to play well.

I've played this extensively (200+ games?) and while I prefer playing other games at the moment, I would still play it in a heartbeat if someone asked for a game.

My personal rating is probably a 10; the game is just that fantastic.  But the reality is that it's extremely tough on new players and as Caverna has shown, it has a few hiccups here and there that could have otherwise made this a perfect game.

Builder game centered around farming.

The Good: Fun heavy strategy game. Several different strategies to pursue. The special cards for occupations and minor improvements give you even more options each turn. I think with experienced players it would clock in around 2 hours. Reminds me a little of Caylus - but better and faster. 

The Bad: There is a chance for some degree of analysis paralysis - due to the large number of options available during your turn. However, early turns have fewer options. Potential for new players to be lost. However this can be dealt with by playing the family game first and make sure they understand early in each stage the importance of feeding their people. Final scoring is rather complicated - but there is a player aid. I like a game where completely different strategies can win, but so far I am wondering if that is true with this game.

Bought the game based on it's position on the list here at BGG. Opened the game and was at first REALLY overwhelmed at my first look at the directions and thought there was no way the wife would understand it or I would be able to explain it to her. I spent just a few minutes really getting into the directions and bot was I wrong.

Not only was I able to explain it well, we able to figure it out and had a really great time playing it and it has been one of the games we really like breaking out when we can. 

* note - traded away as with all the other games we know have this one was never finding it's way to the table anymore.

RATING: 5
Edit: My rating seems to go up and down with this game.  I think it's settled on a 4 or 5.  I just think it's a LOT of work to get a good food machine going and when you don't have the right card combos to help you do that, it can be way too frustrating.  Plus, whoever has the wet nurse will be at too much of an advantage. But the real problem is a feeling that I just can't shake and that's you have very little impact on anyone else and that bugs me.  However good or bad your opponent's score was had nothing to do with anything I did.  Another thing that kills this game for me is "drafting" of cards.  This takes way too long. Just pass out the cards randomly and let me try to figure out how to best use them. I really have no desire to play this game again and if it hits the table (which it ALWAYS does at game night) I'll take a pass and go see a movie instead.

Edit: raised my rating again, from 6 to 7.  Not sure what I missed the first times I played, but now I am truly enjoying it.  I also realize that an astute player can really screw with other players, making the game much less multiplayer solitaire than I initially thought.  

edit:  Raised my rating from 3 to 6.  Played with five and for the first time, I enjoyed it.  I never had trouble feeding my family and ended the game with a full farm and plenty of animals, scoring my best score ever.   Perhaps my low rating was because I always do poorly? Perhaps, but I strongly dislike the lack of player interaction. Still, I think this game could grow on me.

Played four times and liked it less with each play. Three seems harsh, but it's exactly how I feel (likely won't play again but could possibly be convinced...my game group loves it so unless I can negotiate for another game to hit the table I might be stuck playing). 

I can see why some people like this game.  Too me, it's just too much work.  Like actually farming.  With worker placement, you are in direct competition for spots on the board.  Yet for some reason, I really felt like I was just playing a game by myself.  I was struggling to build my own farm so much so that I couldn't be bothered even caring about anyone else's farm.  And you really get the sense that there is nothing you can do to stop other people from scoring points.

Fantastic Game. 

A very solid and elegant worker placement game, greatly enhanced by the cards you draft before the game starts. Drafting cards means you not only mold your strategy for play while drafting, and since their so many cards to randomly choose from, your never going to play the exact same game twice.

I understand why people like this game - two people in my play group love it, but it has just never won me over.

So much has been written about Agricola. Perfect theme integration, tight gameplay, mild but present screwage factor, perfect mixture of predictable and non-predictable elements and replayability for ages.

If, and that's a big if, there's one thing that could have been better, it's the possibility of meta-gaming. Settlers is a little bit more "talkative".

Update: Played it again lately and schooled some friends that never played Agricola as competetive than I did. It's still all about the first kid in round 5 to 7 and good management with the minor improvements (to grab the starting player when you need it ;) ), but you know, with players that know this as well, Agricola is still only comparable to Terry Mystica (or Gaia Project, let's see..) when it comes to great competition against up to 4 opponents where your brain melts, your heart races and you just have great, great fun. Boardgaming at its best.

Such a brilliant game! Super strategic, and it forces you to play a different way each time because of the staggering variety of cards, of which you only receive 7 each from the two decks.

EDIT: guess I got bored of it, and traded it away. The more I played, I became bored with how long it took for the same destination. Despite how different those cards can get, ultimately you always want to achieve the same thing in Agricola: a perfectly balanced farm.

It evokes the theme well, in that I feel like I'm suffering horrible crushing poverty when I play it. It's almost a bit too stressful, but I do want to play more. I like that the main engine doesn't suffer much positive feedback like many similar games, it simply produces points and food.

I'm not convinced by the cards, which make it very hard to keep track of other players' abilities and incentives unless you learn all of them by heart or keep pausing the game to read them. Neither of these options is much fun. Update: I'm even more convinced by this now. The cards detract from the actual game, unless you play it very regularly.

Excellent, Age of Empires-type (the computer version) game of resource management and action-taking. Each player has an empty farm of 15-spaces, two people, and a 2-room hut. You have fourteen turns to completely build up your farm or lose VPs (-1VP per empty space). The house can be built bigger and the family can get up to 5-people in size. The rest of the space is taken up with stables, fields to be plowed, sown, and harvested, and fenced-in pastures. Animals can be obtained, occupations can be learned that give benefits, and improvements obtained that garner VPs and still more benefits. The beauty of this this game is that each player gets a hand of seven each unique Occupations and Improvements that they can purchase each game, so no two games are alike. Buy the right combination of Improvements and Occupations and you will get lots of Food and VPs. This is not the typical, abstract, brain-dead Euro. It is a very deep game with tons of strategy and even more difficult choices. Due to the large number of Occupations and Improvements available (there is a total of 360-cards of all types), no two games will ever play the same.  Players are in effect, relearning how to play the game each time they are dealt their card hand. Highly recommended.

One play was not enough to understand the hype. I mean, it seems okay-ish. A frustrating game, as you always want to do a lot more things than you actually can do. Seems to favor the guy that was dealt cards that complement each other. I like the aesthetics, but I don't understand why this knocked sliced bread off the top of the list.

Four plays is enough to know that this is a really annoying game, in which one can never even come close to getting the engine going before the game ends. It is like a girl flirting and teasing and suggesting, and then saying goodnight right when she knows you're so worked up that you aren't going to get any sleep at all.

A lot of cards seem to offer really helpful benefits that you'll never get to use because it takes the whole game just to get the card onto the table. It fascinates me that so many folks find this great rather than irritating, but hey, there you go.

I've now played many times, and while I may not recommend it as often as I did during my frenzy, I still like this game.  The theme is great.  I really enjoy growing my farm.  The gameplay is challenging.  I constantly feel like there are 4 other things I want to do.  

Even after many plays, I have still not dug very far into the "I" and "K" decks.  So my views are primarily based on the E deck.

The luck of the draw doen't particularly bother me, but it is clear some combos are much nicer than others.  

Now hard to wish to play when Caverna sits on the same shelf.

Many different strategies depending on what minor improvement cards, occupations and lastly, what the other players are doing.  First things you have to concentrate on is growing the family (for more actions), then upgrade the huts.

UPDATE: It does. Very nice game, and quite fast when people has played before, but this does not hold for the first game, I've noticed. Give it another hour at least if there are newbies around.

Several persons have independently expressed doubts about the amount of actions and cards they had to grasp before feeling comfortable with the game, but then again, they don't particularly enjoy Puerto Rico either, so I'll write it off as personal preference.

I'd heard both good things and bad things about this game--the BuzzMonster of Essen 2007.  After one playing, I can see both sides.  One part of the game--professions--seemed to vary wildly in utility while other aspects--the path of the rounds, the resource allocation--were quite enjoyable.  It's going to take a couple more plays before any real verdict can be reached.

I love the theme and how the mechanics supports it. Also the animeeples are a definite plus. While causal gamers tend to be intrigued by the design of this game they also tend to be overwhelmed by its complexity and length of gameplay. For the committed gamer it might be a little to random and therefore they tend to prefer Caylus instead. 

Farmers of the Moor adds to the overall appeal and mechanic of the game. But it also adds time and complexity to the game play. I would suggest you only get it if you play Agricola frequently and you look for even more variation in game play.

Never liked the feeding aspect of these games.  It's too brutal for newer more casual players as are the 10,000 different cards to select from.  Sure it's trying to give you multiple levels to step up into but really all anyone ever liked about it was stabling animals and the resource collection.  For stabling animals and the best parts of Agricola I really prefer Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and for the resource collection and a better spatial game I much prefer Ora et Labora.  I've not yet tried Caverna.

Without cards, its a decent game but I'd rather play Lords of Waterdeep. 

With cards, it is amazing. So many different combos to try out. I like the randomness at the start to help guide your path to victory.

The only thing I dislike - I think family members should be worth less points. You already get more actions so giving them 3 points makes growing your family almost the only way to win.

Missing 2 sets of family tokens (I use my carcassonne meeples as a replacement because they look better).

Too much for me. I like the challenge and strategy, but there is too much to read (all the cards). Felt a little solitare. I don't like the feeling of wanting to do more but can't. Maybe needs more plays

Provides the delightfully frustrating feeling of never being able to do enough.  A player's plan of attack also differs from game to game, thanks to the sheer number of possible card combinations.

Now with 100% more Animeeples, Vegimeeples, Resourceeples, and new designer boards.

This is my favourite worker placement game, but that does not mean I find it without fault. The sheer front-loaded complexity and long playtime means that this game doesn't see much playtime from me. I only get the opportunity to play it with other hardcore boardgame enthusiasts and even then I find myself going for other shorter worker placement games.

In short, it's the best game that I never play, and so I struggle to justify rating it more highly. There's no point in buying a game you won't play.

After one play, I found it fun, but a bit more complicated that I thought it would be. Definitely a stretch to call this one a family game. I'm looking forward to playing it more.
UPDATE: I'm bumping it down a notch to 7. I like it well enough, but it's kind of stressful to play, to be honest. Maybe it's because I always seem to lose so horribly.
UPDATE (Sept. 2011): Back up to an 8! This game shines with 2 players, and since my wife really likes it, that makes for better gaming experiences.

Classic Great Euro Game.

Pure worker placement at his best.
Great re-playability thanks to Minor Improvements and Occupations (I suggest to draft them)

Definetly on the heavy side.
There is so much going on that sometimes, first plays, you can feel lost.

An amazingly intricate worker-placement game with an exceedingly well-integrated farming theme.  Lots has been written about this game, and most of it is true.  The variety of having 14 individual cards adds incredible variety and replayability to the game, but it's still the core mechanics and actions that make it so fun and interesting.  The only "down side" of the game for me is that it wears me out to play, so I'll rarely play multiple games back-to-back (unlike many of my fellow gamers at my FLGS).

Great game that shows something important: it's not impossible to mix cards with variable powers (American design) with a more traditional Euro, if done right. Adding these cards make the game more variable each game than your basic Euro stuff so it's definitively more re-playable.

The game appears to be fiddly from time to time and the fact you need tons of table space to play are problems I have with this one.

Excellent 2 player game. I note that people have many complaints about 4+ player games being to brutal and cutting each other off, but for two players that's not as big of an issue because there are so many options available to you. I think I would enjoy if the game allowed for a little more specialization in strategy, but I suppose that balance is kindof the point.

RATING: 8
This is a great game. The mechanics are tight and when playing with card drafting, there does not seem to be one specific path to victory. 

While I very much enjoy this game, beware, it's stressful. The feed your family mechanic can be very draining and you may spend the entire game trying to dig yourself out of a hole. (If you know anything about farming, this might be very thematic...).

Play with the cards, and draft the cards and this will be an awesome game.

RATING: 6
Overall a decent game.

Several times in the game players felt like they either had no good choice to make when placing workers or were slowed by analysis paralysis.  Neither of those is good in my opinion.

The scoring seems a bit convoluted and complicated - time consuming to track your own score let alone anyone else's score.

The first few turns seem to take forever and accomplish very little until the proper action cards are available.  The end of the game seems to come just as people are getting their farms going.

Right now I like Caylus and Stone Age better than Agricola for the "worker placement" games.

When I play this game the base mechanics make me feel like I am playing through a simulation of an excel spreadsheet.  When I add in the cards, it makes the game a lot more interesting, but brutally random since some players will get a hand of highly synergistic cards that let them get much more out of every action than typical, while the other players will have a hand of mutually contradictory garbage that makes it impossible to compete.

Games like that are okay, if they are short, but when the game last 3+ hours, that sort of randomness is not interesting to me.  Some will love it, and clearly do.

The only reason this is not a 10 is due to the annoying setup time.  It also does not scale perfectly to larger number of players.  I am nitpicking though.  This game is a gem.  I love games where not only are my opponents messing with me, but I am also feeling as if I am constantly on the edge.  I also love how almost every game feels like a disaster until the last turn or so, where everything somehow magically comes together.

Great blend of different game designs. Other than the start player mechanics which have the potential to lead to some unbalance in 4-5 player games, a top placement/resource collection/path to victory planning game. I like playing with 4 or less. Forcing a somewhat balances approach with the many scoring parameters  seems to result in a close game (in most cases) at the end and also adds to some uncertainty as to where each person is in the standings. Card variety is a big part of its high rating but can also be the difference in a game with similarly skilled players.

It's okay.  I mean, okay, sure, it's totally good, but at this point and in this worker-placement-and-resource-management-saturated environment, the main appeal for me is the cute occupations and such.  Meanwhile, I wish the cards and VP structure encouraged more strategic variety.

Update: man, Caverna really brought into focus everything I don't like about this game, without actually making me want to play Caverna either.  I'm provisionally downgrading this to a 7.  Maybe it'll creep back up to a 7.5 once I've gotten over this whole Caverna thing.  I do still very much need to try FotM.

I'm not as high on this one as most.  I feel like the game would benefit from fewer occupation and minor improvement options.  Also don't like how the scoring hinders creative strategies by requiring you to have a little bit of everything.  I do appreciate the solid solo play option, though.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Very little interaction, as the only way to influence other players is through the action drafting. The game is designed in such a way trying to block opponents is sub-optimal, as it's generally better to pursue your own goals.

Action drafting aside, the game is a pure optimization activity of snowball economies, where every player is on his own, giving life to its own farm, and lasts far too long for what it offers. Would rate higher if a game with newbies could be reliably finished in an hour or less.

I see the appeal it has, particularly for those who love low conflict games, but this is definitely not for me. Not a bad game though, and will play if asked.

Intriguing complex strategy game in which you develop your near empty farmyard into a booming farm with pastures full of cattle and lots of crops on your fields. The farming theme fits remarkably well with the game mechanics. *** Recommended to start with the family game during a learning session. The full game adds sets of occupation and minor improvement cards which increases the complexity of the game, but also ensures a rich variability in possible game scenarios. *** Closest victory: 3 players tied with 30 points and me with 31 points (K-deck on 25/12/2013) *** Played: Family Game: 2-player (p2/w2), 3-player (p2/w2), 4-player (p5/w3) & 5-player (p3/w1) / Full game with E-deck: 3-player (p4/w2), 4-player (p6/w3) & 5-player (p7/w5) / Full game with I-deck: 3 player (p1/w0) & 4-player (p3/w3) / Full game with K-deck: 3-player (p6/w5) & 4-player (p6/w6).

Its a good game but I think clearly over rated. 

Caylus did a better job at pretty much the same thing a couple of years ago. Caylus may take a little too long but Agricola offsets that by having much longer set up/pack up times and more general fiddliness during play.

Also Caylus feels at least somewhat interactive whereas Agricola feels largely solitaire with any actually screwage being completely incidental.

I prefer the family game to advanced one. I don't really see how the minor improvements and occupations add anything to the game other than AP and imbalance.

Good amount of complexity and the theme is easily approachable to more casual players. Agricola is competitive, and often forces you to rethink and adapt your strategy based on other player's moves.

 better than others as well and not having a very good hand could

Cards get to be a bit much to keep track of - especially more interactive decks. Best played as the family version to keep it light.

2014 - Family version strips off the strategic game from this euro (see Walnut Grove for a better light homesteader) so you end up with just a thin euro skeleton.

a nice family game with rather high replayability. not very interactive - there's not enough competition between players for my taste. with less conflict oriented gaming group it works really nice. an interesting thing about this game is the feeling of scarcity - there are not enough rounds, not enough resources, not enough actions. you really have to optimize your moves. newcomers might feel lost at first - absolutely worthless rulebook makes a not-so-difficult game seem complicated.

This is my first daly into deep strategy. Thus far I've really enjoyed the experience. I've come to describe Agricola as SoC that is actually good.

I love how carefully they've managed scalability and truly look forward to a 5 person game

Update Jan13: I've downgraded this game from a perfect 10 as there are a handful of Euros that'd I'd rather play more than it. It is still a great game that I thoroughly enjoy but it waits in line behind Keyflower and Troyes for my Euro hit

This is a good game.  There is a high re-playability with the Occupation and Minor Improvement Cards.  I like to form a 7 card hand using 1E, 2I, and 4B.  I haven't tried the 'drafting' mechanic yet, but I suspect that will become the favorite way of starting hand selection.

Uno de los juegos de recursos más completos y complejos, aunque gracias a su versión familiar también es un gran juego de iniciación en el género. Es difícil de dominar de primeras, pero eso y la cantidad de mazos lo hace tremendamente rejugable. Y no permite fallos de cálculo a pesar de su permisividad en el número de estrategias. Nunca el estrés fue tan divertido.

Agricola is an aggravating, yet interesting worker placement game. In it there are several rounds and during each round you place your worker(s) in certain spots to perform duties such as chop wood, gather animals, cook food, etc. much like a typical worker placement game. However, there are so many goals you have to accomplish that its nearly impossible to do them all, especially if you are playing with 3 or more people. You will get minus points if you don't get a certain amount of animals, buildings, food, etc. What makes the matters worse if the rounds fly by so fast that you have very little opportunity to complete needed tasks. Also, you are required to feed your people which requires you to get food - IMO one of the hardest aspects of the game. 

If you havent played it, give it a shot, but I wouldn't really recommend buying it.

I REALLY wanted to like this game.  But I could not as it was too unfriendly.  

For a euro, really only one person can farm at a time?   no wonder Europe is in debt. 

If I wanted to play something where I was worried about my next meal came from I would go back to my college days, or those really bad times when my parents were too proud to go on welfare growing up. 

I wish it was more enabling like Le Havre or harvest moon.

RATING: 4
This is a fun game! But, once you play it a few times, you establish a certain pattern. And as a result, most games end the same way. There is little variability from game to game. Also suffers from multiplayer solitaire issues, where you are playing with people, and their actions affect you and vice versa.... But you aren't really playing with other people, you are mostly quietly doing your own thing. And fervently planning out card combinations that will benefit you 7 rounds later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solo play. As expected very similar to Caverna but less polished. After one play there doesn't appear to be much variation apart from the occupation and minor improvement cards which can make or break your game before you've even started. The cards I got in my game didn't seem that good apart from the axe.

essen 2007. language level 2 (3). Lots of different cards with much text on them but the cards don't change when the game is started.

great 2 player game.

I believe this is a number one candidate.

Edit: first comment was typed pre-essen 07
today 2008-08-03 replayed someones solo game
to get a feel for the game.

I am a bit worried that the rules are a bit too much to interpret correctly. Certainly so if I want to explain the game to my friends.
There are a huge amount of things to do in your turn. So many infact that this game can turn into a real brainburner for the AP crowd. So my main concern is that you have to plan far ahead. In order to do so you have to have a couple of games under your belt. The friends I play with are not real gamers and I think this will not be fun for them as they don't know what they are doing.

I think it is a brilliant game. Don't get me wrong and I still think this will be the future number one. 
I have to get some more solo plays in before I can introduce this to my friends. Puerto Rico is much easier to explain I feel because there aren't as many options to do each turn.

Rating will go up in time. 

Edit 2017 rating rethink.
Downgrade from 8.99 to 8.
There are games that I like more and it hasn't hitthe table in 2016.

I have played this with friends 30 or more times. I've even played in 3 times same day.  Each time it was interesting and new.  Each time gameplay and resources were different enough to keep it challenging, keep me thinking, planning, hoping.  It challenges the player and even has a solo mode for this reason.  It's great alone, but adds with more folks.  Better with 3 and up.  Many of the expansions are completely unnecessary and detract.

After only one game played in which we were learning the game I can tell already this is an excellent game.  No luck involved, just a lot of strategy.  It comes with a ton of cards that you don't have to use all at once so each game will be different.  And while you are playing against the other players it doesn't feel so "cut-throat."  Sure there's opportunities to notice what the other players are doing and thwart them, but with so few, precious actions available each turn you won't spend much time doing that.  I'm already envisioning how I want to play next time.
Update: Bumped my rating up to 9 after another play.  I remember thinking after my first game, "how the heck are you supposed to fill up all those spaces" but with a good strategy I managed to do so my second game.  Its hard not to love this game with so much originality and so many options.

RATING: 8
Agricola is a pure worker placement game, one of the king of the Eurogame genre.

This could make it hard to play for beginners and a game only for hardcore players, but that's not the case. 2 things helps new players get into the game :
- The theme, which is very engaging
- The "Need to feed my family" mechanic. A new player will always know that they at least need to do that. This goal will guide and ease them into the game. They probably won't win against experienced players, but at least they will be active for the whole game.

Even the first play will be enjoyable, because contrary to many others game in the genre, you always have a goal and therefore knows what to do. This feeling that the game is pushing me to play is something unique to this game, that I like very much. It's the only economic game that I dare propose to players which aren't big fans of such games.

Of course, for fan of the genre, the game is also great, with a very interesting scoring mechanism (having to score in every category is hard), a card system which make each play different, and lot of possibilites and competition between the players.

The one thing I dont like about this game is it looks like a mess on the table. Otherwise it is a good game with lots of replayability--which is probably mentioned all over--due the the number of occupation/improvement cards included. Lots of tough decisions to make in this game.

Agricola is surprisingly easy to teach as long as you start with the family game.  I have found that even novice gamers can grasp the concepts with relative ease for something so deep.

It's funny to me that Euro fans make fun of people who like plastic minis in their games, and then turn around and become enraged that they can't get animeeples.  Come on, people!

The game is long, complicated, and at times stressful. However, that somehow works out extremely well in Agricola. Aside from the hand you're dealt at the start, there isn't much of a luck factor. The opportunity-cost factor, however, is prominent all game long.

Do you take the three wood now? Or do you take another job you need, and hope that nobody else takes the wood so you can nab it next round when it's 6? They could have called this game, "Tragedy of the Commons," although it probably wouldn't have sold well.

Plus the bits and pieces all neat, and there are literally hundreds of unique ability cards. Can't go wrong there!

One of my first worker placement games and one I still really like. There's a good amount of pressure on the player's in this one as each action is significant and you generally don't have time to do what you want/need to do. Efficiency is key here and not easy to come by.

The family version is great fun but in some ways I find it harder than the full version. It is less complex for sure, but the cards add different options for players to obtain the resources they want or to work around the barriers the game and other people present. Without the cards all you have to go with is the basic actions and it can be a much tighter game.

What a fantastic game. When I went through my game designing phase back in the early nineties I so wanted to create a farming game, I just loved the idea of choosing which crops to grow, using crop rotation, whether to go dairy or beef or sheep etc, but it never got beyond a few jotted down ideas. This game knocked those thoughts for six, it has everything I ever wanted in a farming game. I have rated it 8 but really its almost but not quite a 9. This game works perfectly well as a solo game and multi-player, there are no faults with it except Wendy uses the midwife to devastating effect.

RATING: 8
I think the game is fun but can get pretty intense for some players.  Having more players seems to shift to more tactical play, since it's hard to predict every player's needs among the various options, but the game still seems enjoyable with different numbers of players.  It can take a while to play, especially with new players.

The game could use a mechanism to even out the effects of occupations and minor improvements.  Occasionally, the imbalance is reasonably severe.  It's generally difficult and/or unwise to deploy many cards, so each player only needs a couple of useful ones to stay competitive.  However, drafting can take pretty long for only a minor improvement to card balance, while also increasing the value of improvements and occupations overall.

The turn order mechanism can be a little annoying, especially in a large game, but it's hard to tell if the impact is truly significant in the midst of the more impactful differences among cards and strategies.  We've since mostly switched to Caylus-style shifting of turn order.

Excited to try this game as it is highly rated and worker placement. I really enjoy worker placement. Based on mechanics only, it would have ranked higher. It loses points for me for two reasons. For its weight, it just isn't interesting enough to hold my attention for the time required. I like "thinky" games, but this one didn't give me enough to be worth it. More importantly, I really didn't like being punished for not doing things. It felt limiting. Would definitely play it again, but there are other games I prefer.

[2014.Mar.01] :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:

[2008.Aug.18] The Z-Man Games production is quite a good-looking game and the inclusion of the animeeples--instead of the cubes found in the standard game box--gives the game just a touch more flavor. In addition to the attractiveness of the visual design and quirky, but fun, artwork, [i]Agricola[/i] is a truly elegant game. Even without the minor improvements and occupation cards, the family game is fun and an excellent way to introduce the game's mechanics to new players and/or non-gamers. That said, the standard game, which does include the minor improvement and occupation cards, successfully takes the game to the next level. (My only concern/gripe/issue with the overall production is that the 300+ cards included in the game are not printed on slightly thicker card stock.) Playing [i]Agricola[/i] with its nearly infinite card combinations will remain a fun past-time for a long-time. Enjoy raising wild boar and harvesting vegetables, I know I will. See you on the farm!

Great game, fun to see your farm and family grow.  The game can take a while with 5 people and getting the offering you want becomes much more difficult. My husband and I played this for 4 days straight after we got it. The game has options for a family game (simpler) or more complicated game with occupations and minor improvements in your hand.  Requires a lot of table space and strategizing to win. Sadly, Le Havre may have retired this game for me.

Picked it up on a whim and have found that it's the best board game in our collection.  It has so many elements to it that can lead to victory and has nearly removed the luck factor.  A win in this game is an accomplishment.  I find that I do the same thing repeatedly, and I'm usually in the hunt for the win, so my method sometimes feels repetitive.  However, it's a good game that keeps most people coming back for more.  It plays well from 1-5 players, which is rare.  Highly recommended.

Fun game with lots of replay value due to changing professions/improvements. Light on player interaction - only done indirectly - no 'take that'. Initial setup and learning a little overwhelming as there are many pieces and cards to deal with.

There ARE broken card combos so YMMV. Caverna mitigates the card RNG, but sacrifices the unpredictability, excitement, and replayability in so doing.

¿Qué se puede decir del Agricola? Es un juego que me gusta mucho y se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, cuanto más lo juegas más te gusta. Creo que el modo familiar de jugarlo esta infravalorado, me parece muy estrtégico y con menos influencia del azar al no usar las cartas.

Haven't played it enough without said person to discover if he was the only element of the game I didn't enjoy. Maybe somebody wants to play is sometime and I might edit the rating.

Played Agricola at BayCon 2009. Well laid out board, excellent bits (carved wooden animals), pity about the game. Agricola is very easy to get into and the mechanics seem to fit the game, but I didn’t find it that interesting. Once you have decided on how you are going to develop your farm (and players need to have different strategies as you can’t all do the same thing, because for example there is a severe shortage of buildings) I felt I was in a game of  multi player solitaire. My only interest in what other players were doing was to anticipate any action that might block/delay my progress. The player interaction seemed limited. Good game for introducing non-gamers but doesn’t strike me as having long term appeal. I’ll play it again but you won’t find me in the stampede. Not on my shopping list! I can't see what all the fss is about.

Played twice, 3 players, family and normal versions.  Okay, yeah, the game is good.  Tons of decisions to make, though it seems like a few initial goals are obvious and will be the same for most games.  The game is good - but I'm not sure I agree that it is the best modern game.  However, I'm told the more advanced game takes some of the stuffy sameness out of the game, and I should try that version eventually.

The theme is strong here, and the game mechanics work well. If I don't like this one more it's due to my theme preferences (I am biased to more epic themes) and because, in fact, you don't "use" your farm at any point of the game. True, you are building a farm, and you "feel" like doing so. But, well, "why" are you building it? You don't use what you have built at any point of the game, and due to this Agricola ends up feeling as a completely abstract game. For me, playing Agricola feels a bit like playing go, and if I want a game experience such this... Well, I prefer the later.

It took a while before I could learn what BGG ranking meant. When I finally found the list, I was trying to see which game was in first place. And it was Agricola. Since it's the number 1 BGG game, it should not be that bad. At last no, It's an horrible game.

The game could be summarized as "Too much": Too much cards, too much special abilities, too much actions, too much resource and not enough actions to use them all. Oh! damn, that breaks the "too much" chain.

You start with a bunch of special ability cards relatively complex to analyze, and you won't use even 3/4 of these cards. Why do you give me these cards If I am not likely to use them. Not only the powers they give are not the sun and the moon, but you need to spend resources and actions to activate them. By the way, Actions are pretty scarce.

It is very hard to do everything because of the limited amount of things you can do. But the game rewards you for doing everything, not for specializing. 

For some actions, there are multiple ways to achieve them. But there are some actions that you can only have 1 of them for the whole game. Which mean that it gets blocked very easily.

Finally, there is so much things to think about that it is very hard to know where you are going. Also, since you need to do everything and cannot focus on a specific thing, it gives the feeling of what-ever you do, everybody is going to score average in everywhere and get  a similar score to everybody else.

It other words, if you survive, your score will be not that much more or less than other players score. Which mean that there is actually now way to actually get ahead of your opponents or know if you are actually leading. It's do your routine stuff, we will declare a winner and you will not know why he won.

[update 2009]  I now prefer Le Havre more than Agricola but somewhat willing to play Agricola with five players.

An excellent deep, or should I say, "wide-angled" game with plenty of choices, options and strategies to pursue.  The first half of your game is based upon how efficient you are at combining the 14 cards that are randomnly distributed at game's start.  As of this writing (Nov. 2007), I can't but help think that there will be a more streamlined/shorter version of this later on down the road (i.e.- Power Grid).

I was doubtful that this game would live up to the hype. I bought it on the spur of the moment when Pozy had it on sale and I am very thankful that I did, as it has become one of our 5 favorite games.

Yes, the game really is awesome.  Multiple strategies and the cards provide virtually endless variation.  It has become my wife's favorite game, which makes it easy to get to the table. I disagree with the criticism that the game is multi-player solitaire.  Just because you can't attack the other players' farms does not mean you can't screw their plans.

My wife also loves the game, which is a huge bonus as it gets to the table much more often.

I finally have played this game, and it wasn't what I expected. To be honest the game is solid for what it is. I can see the appeal for fans of Euros. I am not a fan of Euros for the most part. It seems to me that the designer played Puerto Rico and decided he wanted to make a heavier version of that game. He succeeded in that, but in the end that is all that it feels like, a Puerto Rico Heavy.  I also have to say that the mechanics, contrary to popular belief, Agricola's mechanics are not very thematic. The mechanics could be tied into all sorts of themes, and honestly they are mechanics that I generally despise in games. The game is also quite fiddly, with too many pieces, and too much going on.  

And to top it off, the theme of the game is the worst theme I have ever seen for a game. I have farmed before, I don't want to do it when I play games.

A dreadful mess of a game whose clear progenitors are multiplayer solitaire puzzles such as Princes of Florence.  The hand of occupation and minor improvement cards that one is dealt at game start are a clear attempt to add "variety" to the game, but I see it as layers of ugly combinatoric complexity and a silly way of deciding the game before move one is played.  Do you have a hand of cards that work synergistically with one another?  Bully for you.  Have a hand of random crap?  Tough row to hoe.

It's depressing to see Mr. Rosenberg, an inventor of unusual card games that I admire (Klunker, Bohnanza, Mamma Mia) turn out such dreck.  But then, Agricola seems to be selling well amongst the obsessive-compulsive efficiency-mongers that populate BGG and who tweak games for solo play, probably the ideal player count for an exercise like this.

I don't care how many options and interlocking rulesets a game has; if I see no compelling reason to play it with other human beings present then the game is spiritually broken.

A "must have" for eurogamers, right? I think Bellfort or Caylus are more enjoyable "worker placement" games, with more interaction, but yet I really like Agricola. It's a very good and deep game with a huge amount of variations! Also the theme is really immersive (I bought the wooden tokens from Mayday, I love them!). I think what I find most frustrating is that you only have two workers most of the game (that means only two actions!), and also that it takes A LOT to set up (even the easy familiar version).

RATING: 9
The game flow was perfect from my first game on!  The fact that players take a small action at a time helps, here.  It's one of these more meaty games that don't require you to re-read the rules each time you play.

The fact that harvests come faster and faster towards the end felt nice: it makes for a more climatic ending.

The playing time feels a little bit long, compared to a tense and relatively short game like Race for the Galaxy, but the thinking time was close to 100 % of the whole playing time.

Building something during the course of the game feels good: closer to the end, you can cook lamb in order to feed your family, should this become necessary, whereas this is not possible at the very beginning.  It feels like you accomplished something--enjoying some luxury doesn't hurt!

Interaction between players is of a special kind: there is no direct retribution and confrontation; what you can do is to have enough strategies so that you don't suffer from other players hindering one of them (by taking an action that you wanted).  There is more interaction than in Race for the Galaxy, though.

In my first 2-player Family Game, I regretted that interaction was so limited: we never wanted the same Action space as our opponent!  The interaction was even lower than in our Race for the Galaxy games.  I did not feel the same kind of competition as with Caylus Magna Carta.  Things improved with our 2nd game, since we had a better idea of what our opponent could be wanting to do.  I hope that more interaction will come from using the I deck.

I found it hard to really measure the cost/benefit ratio of any action in my first, rather quick Family game--much harder than in Caylus Magna Carta.  Thus, finding a good strategy is not easy.  However, since diversifying one's production is an obvious strategy, there is always enjoyment to be found in trying to implement it.

On a similar note, the fact that the consequences of your choices are not immediately quantifiable makes the game less tense and dense than in games with direct confrontations (e.g., Colossal Arena, or Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation).

Playing a 2-player Family game felt a little bit like Caylus Magna Carta, except that it was a richer experience: there are more resource types and available actions, and they are linked to each other in a deeper manner (for instance, you build fences, then have animals, then build an over and cook the meat).  Using Animeeples helps feeling more immersed in the game than abstractly building the castle in Caylus Magna Carta.

Playing with the E deck adds depth to the game.  It is nice to look for and find powerful combos.  It is also fulfilling to play cards that are adapted to the situation as it unfolds.

It seems relatively difficult to "outsmart" your opponents, as interaction is limited.  Instead, you always have to perform the best possible, but for your own little farm.

Overall, a well oiled economic/worker placement game, that apparently scales very well from 1 to 5 players.  Probably one of the best in its genre (I prefer it to Caylus Magna Carta).

The setup time is a tad long, but remains very reasonable.

Ein sehr schönes Spiel. Man versucht im Arbeiter-Einsetz Manier seinen Bauernhof mit Äckern, Weiden mit Tieren und Ställen zu füllen und zusätzlich sein Haus auszubauen und neue Familienmitglieder zu produzieren. In regelmäßigen Abständen muss man diese noch ernähren und das alles wollen die anderen Spieler auch.
Jeder Spieler nimmt den anderen die Aktionsfelder weg, die Ressourcen sind knapp und man hat andauernd das Gefühl: Alles geht schief!
Zu viert spielt es sich total anders als zu dritt und ebenso anders als zu zweit. Ich liebe Agricola, spiele es aber mittlerweile nur noch auf dem iPad, da es massiven Mitspielermangel gibt. Hier haben wir es endlich mal wieder auf den Tisch bekommen.

I had heard many commendable words for my first meeting with "Agricola". As you know, at play prices almost everything was cleared up, which can be forgiven. Many equally good strategies should supposedly lead to the goal. My first game was a solo game and it was really fun. I did not see the game as a "good game" at first. I did not realize right away that "Agricola" would become one of my favorite top 3 games. There are different ways to get victory points, but you can only get four points per scoring area, and you actually have to build or harvest everything, which in turn means you have too few actions. Where were the different victory strategies? Was it not just to create as many things as possible?
However, after the following games it has become clear that long-term planning for a particular direction, such as Animal Breeding should be there, but one must constantly respond tactically. The other categories can also be reached on the basis of the main strategy and especially towards the end. A change of strategy is also possible, so that you can never get stuck. In my opinion Uwe Rosenberg succeeded with "Agricola" the "almost" perfect game. Only in advance, later more.
Now I would first like to refute the criticism of the difficult instructions, because now, at least from the seventh edition, there is a revision. However, I noticed an error here. On page two, action cards are spoken without describing what they are. The abundance of different cards I was not clear what it is. The explanation follows only on page five in the game instructions for the entire game. As "Agricola" is explained by an experienced player, but also otherwise quite complex games, dissatisfied participants quickly understood the mechanisms. Collecting resources and inserting is very intuitive. Rather, the abundance of possibilities is a problem for newcomers.
Very well came with me and others, that you create something and see the buildings that have been built for you. Slowly the farm grows around animals on meadows and in stables, fields are made, the house gets new rooms and the family increases. For Nintendo players Agricola could be the board game implementation of the released version on different platforms "Harvest Moon".
Because of the abundance of cards and the variable action fields with different numbers of players, each game develops differently. As a passionate strategist, I think it is important that the cards are each drawn up with an extra card before the start of the game according to the "7 Wonders" principle. This means that each receives eight small purchases and eight training sessions, one chooses and passes it on to the neighbor player, leaves a card at the end and puts it away. In the tutorial it is only suggested to make seven cards.
In the following I will explain why in my opinion the game has no clear 10 points, but "only" excellent 9:
There are three cards, even late on the "Family Gain" card, which have four cards that I think are too good. Once this was the "beloved", which seems too powerful in the early stages of the extra action per round. For this I recommend to increase the nutritional values ​​by one to three per harvest time for this family member. Furthermore, there are the "forward and cart team", each of which allows six free fields in fields to be changed when arable fields are used. Although you have to pay three or four wood here and have three training, but it is quite possible that you can use the training anyway.
Then, with these small purchases, each time within three actions, only six fields, each of which would give one downside, are covered. Five fields also offer four victory points. In addition, small purchases on certain action fields can be played practically occasionally. Finally, it should be noted that an early "wet nurse" can get up to three extra set pieces (150% increase!) For a teammate while the rest is still waiting for the "Family Growth" card and additional actions. A change of the rules was conveniently integrated into the Moorbauern extension. Cool game with building a farming family

This and Twilight Struggle are my two favorite games. This game is simply amazing, it plays great with 1-5 players and is super easy to learn but very hard to master. No two games will play the same and you have to change how you play depending on who your playing. I have played two games against my housemate and we have tied both times because we both wanna take the same stuff.

Currently, this is my favorite game. I love how much you have to think and plan ahead and I love how punishing this game can be. The only problem is it usually takes people a few times to catch on and the game can be lengthy (around two hours) with three players or more so it is hard to get to the table. Looking forward to trying more Rosenberg's!

Good game with lots of components. A bit "cruel" though as one needs to feed their workers very very often.
There is only one strategy really - you need to do a bit of everything and as soon as you've built your "engine" and would like to enjoy it - it's over.
But after several plays (especially solo games) it feels like a puzzle that you need to solve every time and it's the same puzzle (because you need to do more or less the same things every game). Yes, there are random cards every game, but I feel that they are slightly unbalanced and don't bring as much as I would have wanted.
Don't think it's my "cup of tea".

Steady, stalwart Agricola. I play this whenever I get the chance, but it really stresses out my husband, so we don't get to it very often at home. Fortunately, teaching it to friends has gone well! It has that quality where every action in the game serves a tangible purpose, so understanding your choices becomes easy, even if executing them in the most efficient way is not.

Solo Rating: 9

I've played it 4 times, but I have to play it a few times with more people for a definitive rating. 

Solo it is great but after a few times, the jobs (wich are only 10 in the solo play) become repetitive and boring . The game is quite breakable after a few times and the strategies are dictated mostly by the Minor Improvements. But still, the variety is mostly endless. For a Euro it's amazing. I still need a few more plays or with more people for a real rating. I don't want to mess with the system, hehe.

Edit: I found out that there were more cards for the solo game for the E deck, in the other decks, I've played more times but actually the solo gaming got a little bit old due to the total lack of any kind of interaction with anyone else. I'm getting sick of all kind of solo gaming, it's not a purely "Agricola" thing...

Edit: I finally played both the Basic game and the game with the E deck with my friends. They actually liked it but they got a hang of it until about half into the game. I decided to give this an 8 because it let me wanting for more but I have some problems with the whole game system and the basic mechanic (worker placement). OK it is an strategic game, and the cards somehow balance the game but I can't stand the part where the only interaction you have in the games is when you say: "Hey, that's a nice strategy you have there", or "I'm gonna take the first player token". I ned more interaction, and I know lots of people will say "just use the I deck" (and I will) but the game seems dry and heartless. I'll stick to my Cosmic Encounter for now, but I will continue to try to solve the mistery of why I like Agricola...

A rich worker placement game with more (and constantly changing) options than any I've seen. Great fun to play. The only negatives are 1) the rulebook is not well written (I recommend watching a tutorial video to learn how to play) and 2) there is no balancing mechanism when groups with different levels of experience play. The less experienced players will always get trounced by the more experienced ones. So it plays much better when all in a game are of equal Agricola experience.

Some people argue certain cards are too powerful. And that may be true for those with 50 plus games under their belt who know ideal strategies, but in my limited number of plays I've found that you can always adapt to someone else's seemingly "powerful" card by altering your strategy. The only risk is in ignoring someone's "powerful" card.

RATING: 10
In addition to being our first "heavy" game, this is our first 10 rating.  This is one of the most addicting and fun games we own.  The theme is surprisingly strong and is well represented by the gameplay.  You get personally involved with building up a farm and trying to help your family survive, using multiple different strategies.  The components (animeeples included) are quite good.  The card interactions make each session take on a different flavor and keeps the game fresh and new.  Despite being heavy, the actual gameplay is quite intuitive and reasonable to grasp.  It's also a game that my girlfriend loves and requests.  

We've found the two player game to be very good and quite tense.  The game is tight, resources are short, magnifying the importance of each decision.  Even better, with more players, more actions become available, resulting in a different feeling of gameplay.  This keeps the game fresh and scaleable for any number of players (and we find that you're always involved since you need to watch what actions your opponents are taking).  As a next step game for a newbie gaming couple, [GAMEID=31260] is highly recommended.

Each of the E, I, and K decks give a different feel for the game, keeping it fresh.

There are few things that can keep my interest, make me push myself and want me to come back for more than Agricola - maybe only if Scarlett Johansson set up a love nest for the both of us or I got the call up from Fabio Capello.

I hate to agree with popular opinion but Agricola does deserve to be up there, a real powerhouse of a game that deserves to be recognised as one of the top games.

Despite the fact that the game is too depressing for me none can really deny that this is a really really good game that deserve 7+ rating.

I only score Agricola this low due to the fact that I (strongly) dislike the theme and the way it feels.

Its too depressing for a game and become a knife fight of a farming system contest fest rather than a strategic farming game.

Would totally recommend this to anybody interested in boardgaming.

I love the concept, and the classic Eurogame theme.  However, I think we didn't get the rules right,and the whole process was a miserable failure.

When I was first taught it, I hated it and rated it a 2. I ended the game with no clue as to what was going on, and it dragged on for hours.
I was eventually roped into playing it again using the non-card "family" version - and liked it enough to raise my rating to "7". 
Thus I have come to believe that the cards are a mess, and they ruin the game; I won't play it with them. I suppose for experienced players they add some flavor and new options, but if you are trying to get into it, I highly suggest to avoid the cards for quite a while until you get a sense of the basics. And for heaven's sake, do not teach the game to new players with the cards.

Great game - this has notched up 20 plays for me in around 3 months (which is a lot for me).  We all really enjoy it and not many other games are hitting the table at present.  Still exploring all the decks, and because most of the plays have been 2/3 players with cards, and a few family games, there are still a lot of occupations thta we haven't seen yet.  Even get the odd E deck minor improvement that we haven't seen before cropping up.

Love the variety of ways you can build your farm depending on the cards you have, and what your opponents do. Have upgraded to animeeples and vegemeeples - will make the game more attractive to introduce to new players, and encourage our kids to play this in a couple of years or so.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Plusses: High replayability, novel concept. For such a complex game it's scaleable enough to allow you to wade into it a bit at a time. Game flows pretty smoothly after the first play or two with a new group. Straightforward mechanics create a high-tension game.
Minuses: Not a very good game to introduce to casual gamers. Lots to learn and keep up with during the course of a play. Player interaction is limited mostly to competing for actions in a round, though the I-Deck includes many cards that increase player's effects on each other's farms. Trading/wheeling/dealing between players is not part of the basic rules (though trading as a free action would be pretty painless to implement in a house rule). Though players' game boards are a visual indicator of their standing, scoring at the end of the game can sometimes be a surprise.

However, I believe this is a game best with 4 players.

This game is a big hit with the ladies in group. I myself don't like the game as much as the rest because Agricola requires players to try to do a lot of everything instead of a single goal.

This is probably gamer heresy, but Agricola is only *barely* a good game, and certainly not the greatest thing since sliced bread.

First, the cards are completely out of hand. Even for someone that plays the game incessantly, half the profession and improvement cards would be plenty to last a year (until the first expansion deck was ready), and the decks could have been pared down to the best, most interesting and best balanced ideas, leaving the rest to cook a while longer.

Second, the "turn order mechanic" (a start player location where you can place a worker) is a joke. If start player is going to be self-selecting, there have to be tools for other players to move themselves up in the order of play as well. Failing that (and it can get fussy to operate), the number of top-tier choices, especially early in the game, needs to be larger.

The scoring is a bit fussy and precious, too, but not beyond the pale.

All of that said, I like Agricola miles better than I do Caylus and every other popular worker placement game, save Le Havre. The professions and improvements are a nod at strategic play, rather than pure tactical opportunism, and breadth of options (agriculture, animal husbandry, building your home and family, professions and improvements) is nice and chewy. Perhaps shaving one of these facets off, or reducing the types of animals, crops and resources by one each would make the game a bit tighter and less fussy, but it's still within the bounds of sanity. I'm happy to oblige my friends who enjoy this game, although I slightly prefer Le Havre and my Rosenberg game of choice, by a mile, is is classic, Bohnanza.

This is no game for casual gamers, either, let alone non-gamers. The learning curve is steep, the rules *and* the systems are complex, and it'll take most of an evening to play the first couple times if you have more than three players. I think I'd be more comfortable unleashing Die Macher on newbies than this.

Probably if I got more plays of Agricola I would like it better, but each time I get to play this it is with at least one new player. (and I'm the kind of player who will never play my absolute best or toughest with new players)
I think especially for new and casual gamers a game like this is an awful lot to take in. And even though I really want to like Agricola it still hasn't grabbed me as much as I thought it would. Probably playing more often with the same people would already break down some of the problem. But then I always get 'let's play something new' on game nights.

This game simultaneously makes you feel like you need to do a little everything, but at the same time makes doing so very difficult. I wish there were fewer spaces so there would be more instances where you take the spot that your opponent wants, although that some spots get better over time seems to make the number of good spots significantly less than the number on the board, and you can easily starve an opponent of a resource they want. I don't see anything super outstanding in this game compared to other worker placements (I think the cool time mechanic of Tzolk'in makes it my favorite at the time of writing), but the sheer number of different starting hands that alter your strategy significantly means this game will probably be one of the games in my collection that survives the test of time. Rulebook is the worst I have ever read.

I wish that there weren't so many spaces to refill each round. Especially since until near end game you only have very few actions each round, making each round relatively short, this makes the game pretty fiddly.

I really like the stress of having to feed your family and making it restrict you from doing anything. The downside is if you don't get a good start it is hard to get off the ground, but it makes this game feel more than just a point salad and adds a little bit of theme to what could have been JASE.

This is a very good game. I rate Caylus very highly. Agricola may be better...

- edit 12.24.08

 Agricola is very good. Once we instituted a card draft and starting using Caylus' turn order mechanic, it got even better.

RATING: 9
good theme, simple rules but yet v.addictive and involve lots of strategy. You are constantly fighting over limited resources which leave you at the edge of the seat all the time. A well deserved classic, both me and gf liked it v.much 

played a 5-player game today and i think the strategy is quite different from fewer ppl. All my friends are new gamers and they all liked the game (though it give some of the headache). I think the game require a dedicated group of players who are willing to explore it, otherwise it would be a waste of such a good game

Agricola is an interesting twist on a multiplayer puzzle. Each player is trying to build his puzzle to get the highest score, yet you can also take actions which will reduce an opponents' scores by blocking their actions.

I have played this game several times solo (which really emphasizes the puzzle aspect). I have also played this game several times with 4 and 5 people. A lot of the game can be determined by who best utilizes their occupation and improvement cards.

I have the base game and the Farmers of the Moor expansion.

This is probably my favorite game to play as a two-player game. It also plays really well as a one-player game (at which point it becomes more puzzle-like).  The components are fantastic. Changing out the occupations and tools force you take different strategies each game, keeping it replayable.  

Full disclosure, Farming is my favorite game theme.  It's very difficult to disappoint me when I'm growing things and making food.

as big Ameritrasher, i feel almost ashamed to like this game as much as I do.  I like building up the farm and feeling like its almost self-sufficient by the end of the game.  I like the card combos that work together well...or the ones that don't and making do.   I know alot of people feel that worker-placement is passive aggressive or not really interaction..but ultimately if your opponent can't do what he wants, then you are affecting his actions.

I finally played the Mac Daddy of all worker placements and probably did another 30 games almost immediately on my iPad and phone. Seriously, this game is amazing. I know people complain about the overemphasis on food, but an engine that generates a ton of food is generally a pretty successful one overall.

Also, animals do it in your pastures.

RATING: 7.9
9 to 7.9 My desire to farm has waned for several reasons. Firstly, I have found similar weight games that do not feel as hard work. Secondly, I am not into drafting the occupations and improvements although I realise this makes the strategy better. It also makes it too long, with a pre-game I find boring. I prefer to deal 10, keep 7 sort of thing. Also people I know play this a bit too seriously, so I sometimes avoid it.

Great great game of planning and economic with different resources. I am a bit burned on Euro but this one is definitely good. The Theme is so well integrated (even if it is farming)! Lots of path to victory since everything will give you points. I really like this game and I only play the family version!

[Update] Quite frankly the best game of 2008. It's the first Euro in a lot of time that has surprised me. Theme and mechanic mesh so well!

One of the first worker placement games I bought.  It just doesn't appeal to me anymore.  By the time you get going and feel like you are doing well, the game is over and I am never quite satisfied.

RATING: 10
Think of it as Harvest Moon the board game with 3 levels of complexity, and a ridiculous of occupations (other than just being a farmer).

I say complexity, but the game does not get more complex with the I deck (and I doubt with the k either), and only serves to make it a deeper, richer experience. Also note that the change of deck type also does not lengthen the game.

It does play in about 30 minutes per player, and feels only a fraction of that. This game is simply brilliant.

First game out and I turned out to be the hog farmer. Next my dog died and the wife ran off with the farmer next valley over. His crops were bigger. Next game I'll move the hog pens away from the house. Yes the first time out and I was lost again. This game is very highly rated and the group is going to give it two more spins. So many things to do and I didn't get much done. On the bright side if it's still slow, I think I can trade it easily. Second game and the wife ran off again. The farmer next door picked up a wet nurse and a house goat, so she came back. Game was a little more fun this time. I have played this five times now and it's still only a 7 at best. A couple of more plays and it sinks. Save yourself some time. Deal out the cards and the person who gets the best cards wins. I play games with two groups. One group it did not go over well with - great! The other group likes it - crap. I have to play this stinker once in a while with the second group.I'm just not very good at this game and that's why I have it at a lower rating.
One question - How can the # 1 game have such a problem with cards?  There are all kind of suggestion on how to fix the card unbalance at the start of the game. I don't see any other game in the top 100 with a problem to fix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Every decision is interesting, and the cards make every game vastly different. Building your farm is a fun creative endeavor.

Where Agricola and I part ways is I just find the volume of difficult choices and the unknown consequences quite daunting (although it certainly isn't as overwhelming as Caverna). Making a game plan out of a hand of seven cards before you even begin is quite a difficult task.

I resisted making this a 10 game for a while.  I liked it immediately.  The theme and how it works within the game appealed.  The tense decisions and the sudden realization that you have to feed everyone at the end of this turn, plus the sheer fun of building something up from almost nothing.  And making the cards works together (even if it doesn't always come off) is something that keeps you coming back.  I see the complaint that some cards are better than others - undoubtedly true - but it does not really bother me.  And in the end, it won me over enough to make it one of my rare 10s.

RATING: 10
Wonderful brain-burner worker-placement, scales well for 2-5 players.  Tense.  Deep strategy and planning is rewarded, excellent re-playability, fun theme.  The multitude of occupation and minor improvement cards (and several expansion decks) allow for a plethora of combinations and multiple paths to victory, forcing the player to choose what cards are most important and most complementary.     This game may be considered a bit dry by those seeking a light-hearted luckfest, or more interaction.  A wonderful game about identifying synergies between your minor improvement and occupation cards, setting priorities, [i]following through[/i].

The pressure in this game can be heavy--there doesn't seem quite enough time to get done all you need to with your limited number of turns.  An optimization problem, but with the added unknown of what actions your opponents will choose, thereby making them unavailable to you.  One step further, Agricola becomes a tactical game, where opponents purposely aim to block each other from critical actions on the board that can completely foil their end-game strategy.  

Update:  still enjoying Agricola occasionally, but it is not hitting the table as often due to the laborious set-up and tear-down time [20 min setup, 20-min tear-down with Farmers of the Moor expansion].

Update #2:  Bought a simple compartmentalized bits-organizer for Agricola + FotM animals and resources for $3.  This will seriously enhance is playability, knocking down the setup/tear-down time from 20 min to under 5 min!!! TTFN

Clearly a very deep game.  Have played mostly solo at this point, which means there's a whole lot left to discover, to say the least.  I have yet to have a multi-player game where I knew what I was doing, things felt evenly balanced, etc.  I look forward to digging in.

One thing worth mentioning: I only have the animeeples at this point, but it's amazing how much they add to the game.  And the one play I did with vegimeeples and resourceeples was even more immersive.  This is a game that it pays off to pimp, for sure.  -- March 2, 2011

RATING: 9
What makes this game so charming is that the competitive aspect is really just thinly overlaid on a lovely, gentle game of make-believe about gradually building up one's very own seventeenth-century farm. Even if you lose, a score of over about 22 is a  signal that you can feel like you managed your turns competently, and ended up with a nifty little tract of land. The game could probably be played cutthroat too, but I can't see what the attraction of that would be on the first few dozen plays. It's remarkably easy to teach and to learn on the fly, in spite of the deep complexity of the rules. The cards and gamepieces are fiddly and fussy to keep track of, but for me that actually added to the fun. My one minor quibble is that there's a failure of realism when it comes to trying to imagine how the different actions could possibly be getting performed simultaneously; a simpler game might not have appealed quite so much to Euro diehards, but might also possibly have done a better job of preserving this aspect of the illusion.

The initial learning bump is hard to overcome and still walk away feeling like you'd like to play this beast again.  But after my second game, I'm hooked, I've drunk the Kool Aid, and not even a US Congressman stepping-out of a Cessna onto a landing strip in Guayana can save me now.

UPDATE: Nope, I was wrong.  The farther I get from my last play of this (my third, I believe), the more the game simply disinterests me.  It's not a theme problem, it's a problem in the coherence of the presentation.  And it's just not nearly as fun as other games of similar weight.

The best worker placement game out there.  It does have increasing levels of complexity where the "family game" is reasonably easy to learn.  But I would say this is very much a "gamer's game" and not a family game.  However, if you have kids who can play a game for 2 hrs, the family game variant will work.  

There are an incredible number of card expansions to this game making it very deep.  

Cards, and the combinations make it complex and highly replayable.

AP prone players should stay away.

Looking forward to picking up the deluxe 2017 edition.  Sold our copy to replace with Caverna, and found Caverna just didn't have the same appeal to us.  Now anxiously await the opportunity to get it back on our shelves and on our gaming table.

Ken:
Great game, with depth, incredible replayability, adjustable difficulty and level of interaction, paired with a well-integrated (yet perhaps ho-hum) theme.  Fiddliness reduced with good custom storage.  Family game works well as an introduction, but the occupations and minor improvements of the regular game bring this to a whole extra level of incredible.  To some degree, I still prefer scoring systems wherein you get points for doing things instead of losing points for not doing things, but I still find this game very engaging and enjoyable.  Perhaps the stress of needing to do everything adds that extra kick to the game.

Kathleen:
I agree that this is about an 8.  This is my favorite of the many worker placement style games that we've played.  The scoring system forces you to do everything, which I like.  Has a very well-integrated theme with great artwork.  I prefer playing this with 2 players, although it does work well with 3+.

This is a really nice game- meaty without being too long, absorbing without being too fiddly.  Played it 6 times now plus a couple of solo games and still feel like I'm improving significantly each game.  Because of the "solitaire" and development aspects of the game I've found that first time players enjoy it too, even if their scores aren't high at the end-  people feel they are getting somewhere by the end of the game and are keen to have another go.

My only question is about the repeated replayability of the game- even with the cards I feel there are probably limited strategies.  But Roads and Boats only has one basic strategy and that's replayable so this might be a red herring.

German edition is fine with some work- the paste ups available on the Geek and lots and lots of card protectors are all you need.  And then the stuff doesn't fit in the box.  

I'm off to try out a solo strategy now.....

I resisted getting [i]Agricola[/i] for a long time; the theme just didn't do it for me. But as our gaming group contained a number of women, I thought I should get something a little less political/military. I got hooked on it though; when we have four or five players of mixed company, I enjoy it. I'm not so interested with it as just a two-players game, at that point, I'd rather play [i]At the Gates of Loyang[/i].

A heavy game - literally. It has so many parts and cards it must weigh ten pounds. 

At its heart Agricola is an game of economics.  A game of managing limited resources and production with a limited number of rounds to accomplish several balanced tasks.

The strategic fun is in the cards, and without the cards this game loses it's soul.  Building  power combo to move through this game with an asymmetrical advantage, and placing workers to block theirs is Agricola. 

This is why I have no use for Caverna.  These games are better with a bite.

Vs. Le Harve in game length: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/508744/game-length-and-comparison-to-agricola-and-pr

NB: Agricola has a pressure element in that there's not enough time to do everything you want to do. This is not so in Le Harve. To some it could be a plus, to others a minus?!

Games seems to be able to be bought for $45, however, it's not worth getting until other games have been more played (Puerto Rico, Notre Damme etc)

Good score keeper: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/407450/agricola

As a 2 player game, this apparently still takes 1 hour. See: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/4193/evaluating-agricola-as-a-2-player-game-how-long-would-it-take-how-competitive

It would seem to make more sense sticking with all creatures big and small AND caverna (which seems to be a more enjoyable playing experience according to many).

Agricola does have "Family Rules": http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1bljcq/wsig_agricola_or_all_creatures_big_and_small/

In favor of All Creatures is the lengthy setup time of the original game. "Just getting it out and setting it up for the photo above, and then putting it all away, took nearly as long as it would to play an entire game of Agricola: All Creatures. And that’s for a two-player game." Quote is from: http://geekdad.com/2014/01/agricola-all-creatures/

In light of Caverna's popularity, Agricola should be held off getting unless it can be acqjuired for about $35 with all the animeeples.

RATING: 5
8/2008 Yet anohter resource harvesting game with way too many choices given the amount of time and resources at hand.  There are basically two tasks 1) get enough food for your workers, and 2) use your workers to do a bit of everything available.  Its the latter you're awarded points for in the end - or minus points for neglecting one area.

Agricola is a good game but not #1.  The major flaw lies in the initial 14 cards each player are dealt; secondly the specialized and limited actions available.  (The former can be somewhat lessend by using a variety of house rules, still...)  Granted, the cards gives more replayability but some are unbalanced and some card combinations are a sure victory.  

5/2009 Another game, this time with three players, and I cannot understand how Agricola has the #1 ranking.  We spent 2+ hours, with very little chit-chat, and really didn't accomplish that much.  Rating down 7 -> 5.  The rating explanation "slightly boring" seems fitting.

Excellent game! Very thematic, not easy to read rulebook and learn but mechanics aren't really that bad. After one play you'll have rules down and can focus on strategy. High replay value, tight but not totally unforgiving, and a number of approaches to win. Also, it's more interactive than it seems at first glance.

Too much thoughts and complexity makes this game feel like work rather than a game. In addition, this game is just like professional sports: you need to keep playing in order to be competitive. With the time invested I could play lots of other interesting games that are 1. equally fun; and 2. less demanding. If you want to get a game with depth, this is probably the worst example I could think of as it adds way more complexity than its depth.

I loved Agricola in general, but I find it a bit too "tight", i. e. it has a very limited number of turns to be able to fully exploit every aspect of it. I end up not using a lot of its possibilities. One correction I might add is a larger number of turns and a wider variety in the turn cards.

In every detail a beautiful and clever made game with an unbelievable amount of material and cards. Thank God, no plastic miniatures! Solitaire rules help you learning the game. But Agricola will be no new Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has more tension and clever mechanics. Agricola is more forgiving and easier. Nice and calm building game with low confrontation level. Definitely NO Top 10 game for me but nevertheless a good and solid game.

Clearly it is a good game which poses a lot of questions and forces you to make hard choices by making it difficult to get everything in place as you'd like, but often it seems there is too much counting, and the tendency for analysis paralysis to set in. I could get into it more if I played regularly (would probably need the expansion(s) too as I understand that's the 'ideal') but for me it's rarely the most appealing game on the shelf.

RATING: 6
A very cleverly designed game, with great theme.  The cards make it fun and a bit varied, but it all gets to be too much of a headache in the last few turns and the game slows down a lot.

I find this more fiddly and hard work than eg Puerto Rico, or Dominion, so though it's a great design there's usually something else I'd rather play.

Update: this is sliding further down. It's such a well put together design, but it's just all work and zero fun.

Se gano la primera partida con 56 puntos y dejé para la segunda el oficio de CHIEF, obteniendo 64 puntos, jugado solo con el mazo básico y los oficios  y las mejoras menores se escogen al azar; el juego propone escoger los oficios y el orden de las acciones pero creo que le quita el factor sorpresa al juego. V oy a continuar de esta manera a ver si se logro llegar ala octava partida de forma consecutiva :). Ya voy enla 4 partida de la campañ de 8 y los combos son cada vez mejores, es un JUEGAZO, y solo estoy con el mazo básico.

An appealing theme, the game scales well with different numbers of players, the game is always challenging, always different (thanks to the cards), and when you see your farm at the end of the game, it's always rewarding, even if you didn't win. You do need to pimp out your game though - we use wooden meeples for everything.

extraordinary variability

[COLOR=#0000FF]Großartiges Spielkonzept, das langanhaltenden Spielspaß verspricht. Besonders gut gefällt mir, dass die Wertigkeit/Knappheit der verschiedenen Güter und Ressourcen je nach Anzahl der Mitspieler sehr stark differiert. So sind z.B. Stein und Lehm speziell zu zweit knapp, Schilf zu dritt sehr rar und Äcker sind bei vier oder fünf Personen Mangelware... Es empfiehlt sich also, die eigene Strategie und Kartenwahl immer in direkte Abhängigkeit von den Rahmenbedingungen der aktuellen Partie zu stellen, womit bereits für ein enormes Ausmaß an Abwechslung gesorgt ist.
 
Zwar sind die Karten im direkten Vergleich relativ gut ausbalanciert, doch gibt es einige "mordsmäßig" starke Kartenkombinationen, die das Spiel ziemlich außer Gleichgewicht bringen können. Wie oben bereits erwähnt, ist die Stärke einer "Kombo" allerdings sehr relativ und immer mit Hinblick auf die Mitspielerzahl zu bewerten. Beispiele gefällig? 

Als sehr stark erwiesen sich in unseren Partien (und dies sind nur E-Karten!):
-> Akademiker, Steinbruch, Gartenarbeiter und/oder Saisonarbeiter
-> Holzfäller, Axt, Schilfsammler oder Schilfteich
-> Lehmmischer, Lehmstake , Dachdecker, ggf. Spachtel
-> Steinschlepper, Steinklaue, Restaurator, ggf. Pflughalter oder Fachwerkhaus

In den anderen Kartensätzen befinden sich wohlgemerkt noch weitaus mächtigere Karten wie etwa Amme, Bummelstudent oder Liebhaber![/COLOR]

[COLOR=#009900][b]Card-Drafting Variante[/b] 
Nachdem diese Idee in einem Kommentar zur Agricola-Rezension der Westpark-Gamers aufgetaucht ist, spielen wir das Spiel mit folgender Änderung der Kartenverteilung, die das Kartenglück stark reduziert: Jeder Spieler erhält zu Beginn des Spiels je sieben Ausbildungs- und Anschaffungskarten, von denen er sich jeweils eine aussucht. Die übrigen sechs Karten reicht er an seinen linken Nachbarn weiter, sucht sich wiederum je eine Karte aus und gibt die übrigen Karten weiter... Das Draften endet, sobald alle Spieler je sieben Karten ausgewählt haben (die letzte wählt der Vordermann). Das Hauptspiel bleibt unverändert.
Achtung: Natürlich verlängert das Auswahlverfahren die Spielzeit. Außerdem wächst die Gefahr, dass sich Spieler "ideale" Kartenkombinationen basteln können. Dafür ist diese Möglichkeit nun aber allen gegeben - das Spiel ist also "gerechter" geworden.[/COLOR]

I felt very lonely in this game (like with so many of the Spiel 2007 releases). The game seems to lack direct interaction.

I can confirm this feeling after the second play, I felt totally uninterested in what the others did and still made shared first place. A game shouldn't be like this.

More disturbing things got clear to me recently:
Why can't I plough/build etc. if my neighbour already did? I mean I can understand this restriction for the resource gathering actions, but this is just gamey. Furthermore the minor improvements and occupation cards just have too big differences in quality. Some are completely useless, others are completely overpowered. This game just rubs me the wrong way...

I was simply unimpressed by a game receiving so much praise... it is nothing original (resources management and drafting are implemented in ways I prefer in so many other games), it is very fiddly, amd features an awfully slow start (as you try to analyze your 14 cards and devise some sort of plan to use the best of them). Besides, I do not think that 300+ diffferent cards may be balanced, so I wonder how much of an "unfair" advantage (due to lucky starting hands) can derive from them.

[2-5] This is a tough one. On the other hand I really really love this game, it is the best worker placement game. But the game is full of agonizing choices and sometimes you just screw things up so badly half way through the game that you just have to gimp along while the other players reap the harvests. You need to build your "engine" fast meaning more houses and family members in order to get more actions as you will need food more frequently as the game progresses.

Es uno de mis euro-games favoritos. Sencillo de jugar con unas reglas claras y una hora de juego aproximada.  Con muchas opciones para escoger, cada jugador tiene la posibilidad de tener una estrategia diferente, y altas posibilidades de ganar sin importar si es novato o experimentado. Con un moderado nivel de estress, ya que los recursos se van agotando en cada ronda y es vital hacer las decisiones correctas. Con un final de infarto ya que dependiendo de las opciones tomadas se recibirán puntos de victoria y cualquiera puede ganar.Así, no haya desarrollado todas las capacidades de su granja.

Despite the family-friendly theme, this game teaches you one lesson - there is no such thing as cooperation in the land of Agricola, only brutal competition for survival. If you're last in the turn rotation, you get totally screwed. And the game has no mercy on poor decisions. The beginning of the game offers some flexibility to recover from mistakes, but the latter half feels like a rigid sequence of decisions that, if you haven't prepared for it, can each be a resounding blow against the foundation of your family's legacy. On numerous occasions my family survived the harvest phase only by ravenously eating raw grain with their bare hands because someone took the accursed Bake Bread action.

"A child skips his way to the Bakery, eager to prove himself by baking his family's grain into bread to last through the winter. He arrive only to see the father of the neighboring homestead enter first. 'Hello, good sir!' he says cheerfully, 'I see you're also here to ...' The door slams in the child's face emiting a lingering scent of warm dough. A cold wind blows across the child's neck. His stomach growls."

Agricola is a worker placement Euro-game, wherein the players attempt to construct a flourishing farm, but in most cases the farm never gets that far. There is a constant balancing act between feeding ones family (workers) and developing the farm (including animals, produce, and home). This is a tense game, not due to epic events happening, but due to the struggle of surviving. 

There are a variety of actions to be chosen from, but true diversity in gameplay comes about due to the occupation and improvement cards dealt out at the beginning of the game. Sometimes the cards mesh nicely and a winning strategy falls from it, but other times they just seem somewhat helpful, but not worth the effort. 

It is satisfying when you are able to find an efficient way of feeding ones family, whether through crops or animals. 

The art style of the game is slightly cartoon-ish while not looking silly. The component quality is good, but not the reason this is a widely appreciated game. 

The first few play-throughs are really slow, but eventually players have a good idea of what should be done , even if their optimal actions are taken.

Overall, a good worker placement game if you're okay with the stress of food procurement.

Update: Played a few "full games" by now, and while I like the variety the cards add, the fiddliness and length of the whole thing has made me downgrade the rating again. Back to 7.

While still long and fiddly latest play has made me realize it has lots of potential and I want to play more (and probably length and fiddliness will be less when we are more familiar with it).

Played four times now (family game only), rating gone up from 7 to 8 after second play. I still have the impression that everything I do is ok, because everything will give me points in one way or another. Of course some things are more ok than others and I'll probably find out more in upcoming plays as the rest of my group seems to be in love with Agricola.

RATING: 9.8
This is my grail game.  I love this game.  The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is that so many of my friends either hate it or they do not have the mental capacity to play it well.  Another drawback is the fact that it seems that there is always someone who is a first time player which means that we can't draft occupations/minor improvements which is the MOST FUN WAY TO PLAY.  I give the family game a rating of about 6.  Being dealt cards gets a rating of about 9.  But if the stars aligned and I got to play a 4-5 player game with seasoned/competent gamers who were willing to add 30 minutes to draft, I would be so overcome with joy that I would purchase a puppy for a homeless child. Under those conditions (puppy-free of course), this would be a 10!!!

I was ho-hum when I first tried it (was the German languaged edition with English translations pasted on - very difficult to play that way)... but it has grown on me quite a bit. Only complaint is that the game can drag with five and/or with the AP-prone.

RATING: 7.5
Good worker placement mechanic, extremely tight, you are always behind the 8 ball and you'll always end up feeling, "Could I've done that over this". No matter what u do, you'll always finish short of what u planned out. But great fun never the less.

The food mechanic, really makes this very claustrophobic!

Agricola makes me sad. There were such amazing possibilities with it, but it fell completely flat for most of our players. No one ever requests it. For me, the family game is too simple, but the full game is too imbalanced. It's very unforgiving. I despise the cards for the imbalance -- we tried playing with various drafting options; we tried house rules, which we almost never do. Hopefully "Revised" will fix some of the problems for us.

RATING: 10
A seeming infinite number of strategies makes this game very entertaining. My only complaint is that the cards are somewhat overpowered at times and thus a drafting system is the optimal way to play.

I don't understand why i don't play this game more often.
I think it is because at the time that i got this title,i was not familiar
with the economic/stategic aspect of boardgames and the rules
seemed really hard.
But,i was wrong.It plays so well.it is so thematic that every issue that i had with 
the rules is gone.
We haven't played yet with the K deck though.

I just don't get why people love this game so much and I hate it so much!!!!

I love all the concepts and mechanics and when describing it it sounds like a game I would love, but here I am many plays later still hating it.  My siblings continue to hold it in their top 3.


two years later:
I think I know now, It lacks proper achievements/rewards.
I always feel I didn't do good enough, even when I won.  The rules feel like they just keep you down, I've never felt that great success for a turn like all other games.  Dominion:"yeah! just played a huge string of cards";  carcassonne:"yeah! just compleated a big city";  gin rummy:"yeah! got gin" and so forth. agricola:"dammit, why didn't I get that reed last turn, uggggghhhhhhh"
this game doesnt have the same fun or stratigies other similar games have.  Its like standing in line.  Everyone wants the same good choices.  And the cards make or break the game, its just hard to notice because everyone does poorly.

RATING: 7
Agricola is a game where you'll never be able to do all the things you think you need to do.  It's all about worker placement to activate specific things on your farm.  The person who manages their limited resources the best and utilizes their farm to the utmost will win.

RATING: 7
I like this game, but I much prefer Le Havre.  My problem with Agricola is how long it takes, and how much time you spend waiting for others.  Also I don't like that your options are often limited and the luck of the cards can really save or screw you.

I love this game.  One of the few board games that thus far I have not gotten bored by, made even more interesting by the Through the Seasons Expansion and the use of ani-meoples.  I like to use all 3 decks, and shuffle them up with disregard the number of people.  Deal out 10 occupations and 10 minor improvements let everyone look at all the cards before discarding 3 of each.

Even when you lose, it feels like you have accomplished something when playing the game.  Mechanically the game is straight forward (take a family member and send them to do chores). Game plays well as a solitare option or in groups of 4.  The constant manipulation with goods on the board and in the fields brings this game down a rating point.

Who knew that working a farm, and making sure your family is fed, could be so much fun. Great balanced game.  Even when I get my butt kicked, I have a good time playing.  Was able to teach my mom and dad how to play last christmas. They grasped it right away and had fun.  Not my go to game.  I love how it plays, but I'd rather be battling in space, crafting magic, or hunting down unspeakable horrors.  Good game, boring theme.

If you have never played Agricola, you should do it now. 
This game introduced a whole new kind of games. The enormous amount of cards in the box, augmented with the numerous expansions, make this game different every time you play it. Experience in playing this game is mandatory, if you want to win.

Great simplified simulation of running a farm. 

Minus: 3 (not a fan of games with many cards with small texts that influence the game considerably) - 9 (too complicated for average player)

Minus: 9 (knowledge of cards give a huge advantage over other players)

RATING: 9
Superior game. (This is the original version) 

+For us, tops out at 3 or 4 players.

+Many, many strategies.

+10/3 discard is best for occupations and improvements.

-Some players perceive the private cards creating unfair imbalances in play.  I disagree but it's hard to dispel this perception.

-The only flaw I can see is how hard it is to play a 5'er.  Everyone in my group wants to play Agricola but the battle for the turn order ends up scuttling much strategy in a 5er.  Geek wisdom on this is not to play with that many, sticking to 2-4er.

++Farmers of the Moor is not a must; there are many, many plays in the base game.  Adding the highest complexity of Farmers of the Moor makes this game exponentially better.

This game burns my brain every time I play it.  My wife and I have never really graduated past the family game version.  There are so many variables in the family game version that the more advanced versions seem a bit overwhelming.  Nevertheless, great art, great pieces (animeeples!), clever theme.  It's a bit like two players at solitaire, except they compete for the best resource draws from the middle of the table.  It's fun to guess what resources the other player needs and then take it before s/he has a chance to pick it up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Agricola can be extremely tedious and nerve-wracking, and like any worker placement game, it causes annoying passive aggressive interactions among the players. Randomness in the minor improvements and occupations can also cause discord, as it always seems that one player has an amazing combo while everyone else struggles. That being said, the gameplay involves plenty of strategic maneuvering, planning, and anticipating, which does stimulate the mind as long as you don't get bogged down in the desperation of scrambling for food and resources. I'll play this occasionally if the player group seems up for a challenge.

This game doesn't hold your hand.  In fact, it slaps you around.  You need a plan from round 1.  Hopefully, your plan is a decent one.  The grandpappy of Caverna (also know as "The nicer one").  This game is a classic, and still deserves plays next to Caverna.  Check it out and don't act butt-hurt!

The game is a mix of worker placement and hand management and is a perfectly balanced race for the best farm with an incredible number of paths to victory. Improvements and Professions offer tons of replay value with just the base game.  While a very well-designed game, I find the feeding requirement detracts from the experience.  Though this is Uwe's best-known game, it's far from his best game.

After playing for 4 days with little, or no sleep, 2 players. We have determined this game to be very deep, and detailed. and fun. I love it! This is now my favorite game in the world. I like the fact that each game is different, and interesting in it's own way. Everything about this game is great, art, quality, and it's very well designed. We advise anyone interested in this game to buy the little farm animals. I bought mine from "Thought Hammer.com" and they really add allot of flavor, and plain eye candy to this beautiful game.

RATING: 8.5
I really do love this game.  I love the bits (I got the animeeples, but beyond that, even the normal pieces and the boards and almost everything but the rather ugly food counters are a delight for the eyes).  I love the theme and, even though I can see how the game would be considered dry for some, I feel it fits very well.  On a farm, the main fight is to stay fed and keep one's head above water.  Once that is accomplished, it is time to make improvements.  I love the cards and the replayability they offer (I have not found them imbalanced.... some are just flashier than others)..

However, I do have two real gripes.  The lesser gripe is that I am not much of a fan of the scoring system (I dislike Die Macher for the same reason).  Having to sit down and add up everything is rather anticlimactic.  

My biggest problem, however, is that the game just does not feel paced right.  One of the pleasures of economic engine games is getting your system in working order and reaping the benefits.  I would love to be able to get my farm into working order and then actually watch it work.  Unfortunately, by the time that really happens, the game has come to an end.  I see why, with the mechanics the way they are (particularly the scoring) this must be, but it always leaves a bit of dissatisfaction in my mouth.  Now... this normally turns into saying "ah.. lets play one more game," so it certainly is not a deal-breaker, but it does bother me a bit.

The first true worker placement game in my collection - I remember first playing it at a game night and getting absolutely blown out - but having a ton of fun in the process.  I love the tension in this game of having to feed your family while also expanding your farm.  I also love the aspect of needing to take a balanced approach, versus just focusing on doing one things in the game.

RATING: 8
Rating based on 50+ plays.  I've really enjoyed the games I've played and look forward to playing more.  It's one of those games which, win or lose, provides a sense of satisfaction in what you've built/accomplished during the game.  It's fun to optimize your turns, experience benefits resulting from previous decisions, and basically see things come together.

This is the one hour+ game I think I've ever played 3 times in one day.  Loving it.

UPDATE: ok, I had this set at a "10" for years.  Now that Caverna is out I'm afraid I have to lower it.  Still love Agricola but I no longer "always want to play it" now that we have Agricola 2.  However, Agricola is my favorite worker placement, farming game that doesn't have dwarfs. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't like the random starting hands at all. For a game as long as Agricola, seeing yourself lose because another player was dealt synergistic cards sucks. However, I do enjoy the puzzle of making the most out of what you have, and the game is very fun. I'll probably try drafting the starting hands sometime.

RATING: 5
Interesting.  Better than most of the worker placement games I have played. I look forward to playing with the cards (someday in draft format).  Rating pending more plays.

Really looking forward to trying the card draft.

Okay, I don't want to play this without a draft again.

My group won't play with the Wet Nurse from the Z deck because they feel it is overpowered.  I also don't like the broom/spring cleaning card for the randomness/windfall it can create and the mansion because it is a big double-dipping windfall.  I will probably try to have them removed in the future, or at least modified. 

I can't believe that every combination of cards was throughly playtested.  I think that's probably the biggest weakness of the game.

Every Agricola fan is a sado-masichist.  It's the only explanation.  This game hurts you so much, and yet you love it.  The cards make this game what it is.

Update
Second play, and I still fail to find any fun in this game. Sure it all works... yes there are a few different things you can do to win, but it is very solitaire in nature, most of the blocking is accidental due to the limited nature of certain key actions (like family expansion and adding rooms etc.)  In addition the deal of the cards usually gives certain players a big advantage that I feel will get even bigger as we get better at playing. 

Update
I did finally play this game, and it is a well made set of mechanics that produce a rather boring exercise in min maxing a scoring system. The theme here is irrelevant, it could be anything the rest is just completing  set of goals to score points. 

It is like a bunch of people playing a overly complex version of Bazaar individually, hardly interacting and then comparing scores at the end. The hand of occupation cards you are dealt will either provide you usable advantages or it will not the rest of your play comes down to how well you know the game engines and the scoring requirements. 

Drafting the occupations may make this better, but not by that much. 


all in all i can not see why this thing is so popular.



--------------------------
I have not played this game. I normally do not rank games i have never played, and in fact don't have any opinion as to how good or bad this game is.  I do think that the response by this games publisher (hanno) to the joke rankings was beyond the pale. 
his quote:  
Do you also think it's a fun prank if all the folks who you played this prank on call your mom tomorrow and condole her while telling her you passed away eating your own shit at BGG.con?  IMHO this was uncalled for, unprofessional and unacceptable from a game publisher. 

As asinine as we bgg members tend to get, people who are here to make a living should stay out of the mess. There was never any attempt made at harming the game's rating yet the game publisher took the joke personally and began attack the very gamers who may have been a customer in the near future. 

the poor rating is my small way of protesting those actions. If I ever play this game I will give it a fair rating.

Not a game to introduce to a friend you are trying to convince gaming is fun. It's an engaging game that gets you involved deeply, but for all your fret and strategem and focus and manuvering, at the end, no matter if you win or lose, there is no sense that anything has really happened. And it always ends just when you're really getting together and can start playing, which is the point, but after calculating and tabulating, it lacks that wonderful sense of triumph that other games give you, even those you lose. If I owned this game, I would definitely want to play it from time to time; not owning it, I won't miss it.

I'm not a huge fan of worker placement games.  But this is by far my favorite of the bunch.  I like the farm building.  But I'm not a huge fan of the cards since there's no mechanism to change your hand.  I feel like I'm always watching someone else have a card that amasses them tons of good X, and I can do nothing about it.

Also, it seems that farming as such is almost tangential.  Family growth and house growth seem overpowered compared to actually running a farm.

I also wished that the scoring rewarded specialization.  You can't think "I'm going to build the best sheep farm ever this game".  Every game, you're going to built a more-or-less similar farm.  I don't like scoring mechanisms that force everyone to be pigeon-holed in such a way.

I used to rate this game higher, but lately I've been avoiding it.  For the amount of time it takes to play, there are just so many better things in my opinion.  Thus, I've lovered my rating 7->6.

RATING: 8
I'll start with some bad comments. I don't like worker-placement games like Caylus or PoE(I think it's rather mediocre way to add some interaction). I don't like logical-efficiency games(I think it's rather like puzzle more than game). I don't like many-things-to-do-and-scarce-turns-to-do games(I think it's frustrating rather than fun).

That said, I like Agricola. because-
1) Cards provide almost infinite ways to play. Every dealt hands are different, making every game fresh and demanding new strategy every game.

2) It is highly thematic. Of course there are some gamey-elements(e.g. only one person per one action, years getting shorter). But atmosphere of farming is realized very well(resources, animals, occupations, buildings)

3) It is fun - which is great merit, for many Euros lack fun.

I think this is one of the best Euros, and will be a classic.

Luck of initial card draw can influence the game much more than I firstly thought.

Although I can appreciate the amount of work that has been put by the creators of the game, Agricola  is for me both boring and frustrating. The theme is not at all appealing and the whole "too much to do in so little time" concept is rather indifferent.

Well, I've now played this game 18 or so times and I can honestly say that this game truly deserves it's #1 ranking on BGG. There is so much going on at any one time that you always have a lot of options in how you want to go about building up your farm. I find that a 2 or 3 player game is the sweet spot for me - I've had some VERY close "edge-of-your-seat" games (especially 2 player) with this number of players.

The multiple decks in the game make this immensely replayable - we have only just started on the I (interactive) deck and haven't touched the K deck at all yet. I can see playing this eck for awhile too as all the games so far have only been 2 player so we've just barely touched on the card. 

The great thing about Agricola is that you are never really sure how well you are doing in relationship to the other players except in a very general way. Sure, you can take the time to count up each player's VP total at any given time, but it's not really accurate in telling you who will win, as many powerful cards don't come out until the later part of the game and by then you are really focusing on YOUR farm and how you can improve it verses how you can thwart another player.

We almost always use the "Through the Seasons" expansion and add in a Round "0" to slightly reduce that "Not enough rounds to do all that you want to do" feeling that comes into play with only 14 rounds. It makes the game much more satisfying as your farm is usually a bit more completed with the addition of 1 more round.

I'm really looking forward to getting a copy of "Farmers of the Moor" and have also been working on my own expansion - The Chicken or the Egg (see the post in the forum under variants).

8.0 - Jun 2014 - 7 Plays:  Most of these plays are based on the solo series option and all of them on the iOS app, so this rating is mostly based on Agricola as a solo game.  That being said, I would almost never turn down a competitive game.  I haven't tried playing online yet, but may give that a shot soon.

An excellent example of European gaming. An intense introduction to farming and living off the land. 
I have not tried the family rules, but I understand that is a good way to start learning the game. Simply do not use Occupations or Minor Improvements.
The full game is incredibly complex, with many opportunities to make crucial decisions. While there is some player interaction (ie who gets what action for that round), the race is against the game. Feed your family, upgrade your farm, breed your animals. 
The few first games, consider it well played if
1) your family did not starve. 
2) each game end you have a little more then the last
Finally 3) you haven't thrown a tantrum!

Jury is still very much out on this one, but may soon be leaving the court room.  Just not getting it really.  Seems like a lot of work for a delayed result - did I win?

Love the family game, and have customized pieces that are just adorable! I still get very confused with the expansions, specially the cards with professions. Didn't get it all, so I always prefer the family game best. And that expansion where you had to keep the houses warm?! Damn too much to do, to little actions! (04.06.11)

Dans « Agricola », vous êtes un simple fermier vivant seul avec votre conjoint dans une petite chaumière de bois.
Durant votre tour, vous devez faire deux actions, une pour vous et l'autre pour le conjoint :
prendre de l'argile, du bois ou de la pierre pour construire des bâtiments.
Vous pourriez penser à avoir des enfants afin d'accomplir plus de travail, mais pensez d'abord à améliorer votre maison.

Dawn suggestion (08/05/09): "Agricola is awesome. It's a long game, though (2 hours), and has a pretty big learning curve (or at least, it takes one full game to figure out what's going on--your first game will be the most confusing). But once you get past that, it's great fun."

Great game simply because everyone likes it. The feeling of having your animals breed and your crops multiply is very rewarding. The downside moments are where you look at your board mid-game and see nothing. But it was you that called all the shots so please don't complain. Excellent replayability value due to lots of cards in basic deck, plus two another sets of hundreds of cards in interactive and complex decks. Ah, and yet a amall extension. Need some more?

I'm sure this game "deserves" more than the 6 rating I've given it, but I've only ever played this game with extremely strong and experienced players and I'm nowhere near there yet, so it's not a game I'd necessarily jump at the chance to play again.  Besides, I think I enjoy Caverna more, though I understand the arguments to the contrary.

(10/17) 6. I enjoyed my second play of this a lot more, so this could be rising.

Unlike everyone else, it appears that just a couple plays were enough for me. That means it isn't head & shoulders above other games. In fact, the second game was less fun than the first, as I felt thwarted by cards & timing the whole game. However, the whole shebang is pretty good fun, is so approachable, and pleasant overall.

RATING: 10
Lots of fun, slow start and a quick finish, highly repayable - definitely worth the money. A complex game, includes a "family" version that I highly recommend is played for the first 4 or 5 games so you can pickup a good understanding of the game mechanics before adding in the occupations and minor improvements. This is one of the most replayable games I own, and I almost never turn down the chance to play. You often think "if only I had ONE MORE TURN" at the end. I love it!

This is an excellently designed game - and a very deep one.  Be prepared to spend a good 3-4 hours with it especially if playing the full game with a full set of 5 players which is a bit long for my tastes. 

I finally got to play this again, this time with the family rules.  I think I actually prefer not having to be distracted by the minor improvements while playing since there is so much other stuff to think about anyways.

I bought this based on its position in the BGG rankings (#1 at the time) and was turned on by the components but turned off by the rules and the play time-- I worried it would be too complex. Talking to the best player in my group, who'd tried it once and had no particular desire to ever try it again, sealed its fate. I kept it for a little while and then sold it unplayed.

These days I do more up-front research and tend to do a better job of avoiding mismatches. I do feel like a filthy sinner for selling off such an acclaimed game without even giving it a shot, though.

After waiting 8+ months for the English edition, I am very satisfied.  The game met my extraordinarily high expectations. This game is an instant classic.  My kids will probably want some of that farm bits people are trying to track down (have the animeeples already).

An incredible 2-player oriented review - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/239620Rating after one play - German Ed. with translations.  I believe this has replaced Puerto Rico as the euro of choice in our family (with accompanied decline in the rating for PR).  This game more than lives up to the hype.  This old guy is really excited for this one (more than any new toy I've ever bought surprisingly enough.)

Two points in favor of the game for me:
First, no scoring until the end.  The play is the thing, not the scoring and the winning.  Very un-Euro.
Second, so many interactions nobody could ever 'solve' the game.  Part of the fun of a game is the discoveries found within the game itself.  I don't want to understand everything that is going on from the start to the end of the game.  That's a math problem, no thanks.  I expect this will see many, many plays for years to come.  Some solo, mostly 2-player, but occasionally more.

This game is for people who like variety, discovery and replayability.  If those aren't your thing, take a pass on it.

After 10+ plays all I want to do is keep playing.
Update after over 50 plays - nothing has changed, this game is unbelievable fun and addictive. I haven't been so hooked on a game since Magic first came out eons ago.

Nothing so far to indicate anything but the best eurogame created to date.  The replayability is far beyond any current euro.

Latest update 2014 - still a great, great game. Dropped rating one point as we simply haven't been as into euros in general.

This is a great game, and enough people have given good descriptions as to why that is.

The game is so much about planning, but also about opportunity and considering you opponents plans.

My only problem with this game is that it is quite restrictive, and players with AP can make the gamelength extend significantly; this is because despite there being a limited number of options there is so much to consider.  In my experience AP is less prevalent in less tight games, and where  most options available significantly improve your score/position; I just feel that in my group anyway, those who like to consider every outcome are less likely to hold onto that mindset so tightly when choices have significantly positive outcomes.

Originally I wasn't too exited about the theme, but bought it out of curiosity (to see what the fuss is all about). I'm glad I did! Great mechanics and design, lots of strategic depth and it keeps the tension of players high from start to finish.

It all made more sense when we started to play the 'draft' variant, that allowed players to 'build' their deck and card combinations. It should be part of the main game rules, IMO (e.g., after the family version and one or two introductory 'random card' plays).

Lawrence found the strategies frustrating and incomprehensible.  He may not be able to juggle so many strategical aspects at once - keeping track of his Occupation/Minor Improvement cards, deciding what development aspect to focus on, choosing the proper actions to take each turn, planning ahead, knowing the rules, etc.

I liked it, but I will probably need to play more to understand the timing and strategical intricacies.  It seems the only major variables are the cards your dealt in the beginning and the people you play with.

Probably my favorite worker placement game ATM. Cannot play it enough - always looking back and thinking "what if" had done this or that differently.

RATING: 7
The scoring possibilities seem to hinge on your cards, both individually and how they combine, and some hands are definitely better than others. Even if you ignore the "game", it can still be interesting to see how well you can do with what you have available. Somehow it feels like an activity with victory points added later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I really dig the wide variety of strategies you can pursue within the rather simple game system. The way your timing is forced to react to other players helps to keep things from being just a solo puzzle.

That said, this isn't the sort of game you get all fired up about yelling at dice and cursing the other players.

That combined with the sort of wonky scoring that generally pushes you towards diversity despite any possible awesomeness in a few facets, keeps it in simply "great" territory rather than "totally awesome".

I like the family version because it takes out the added complexity of all the specialty occupation cards. i'd prefer Caverna's freedom in asymetrical gameplay and scoring system, but being forced into well balanced play is just one of the things that make this game so tight and great. Better than Caverna.

RATING: 9
The highest rated game I do not own.  I love every time i get to play this game, and they have done a great job with adding many occupations/improvements which can be added to the game to bring more variety and replay to it.

What I love about Agricola is that in order to win you have to have played smarter than your opponents.  After the first few times of just trying to survive to the end, the possibilities and strategies start to really open up.  However, the downfall can be that one bad turn can ruin the rest of the game for you, so you have to be careful.

My favorite 2+ hour game to play with 4 players.  The worker placement is beautifully simple, and the game makes intuitive sense.

RATING: 7
4 / 5 - Very Good

There's a lot - a hell of a lot - of min/maxing in this game. No hidden information (other than the cards of the other players) means you're constantly trying to add up various potential combinations to spot the best. It's the same problem as power grid, only with less interaction and interest. The plays I racked up on this were mainly solo, and I did enjoy the puzzle element of "solving" it to make a full run of seven campaign games. But once solved it ceased to have much interest. So the rating is a balance of what I'd give solo (6) and what I'd give multi-player (4).

A great game I've played many times. The family version is great for first timers and the many different cards allow for countless possibilities. We've shuffled all of the Minor Improvements into one huge pile.

Rating:

Game quality: Rating is very tentative as it is just a feel rating after a play. I had heard about the stress and and tight gameplay numerous times. It still caught me off guard coming from Lords of Waterdeep and my lone real experience with worker placement games.

Turn order can be the very important here. If you lose out in it, you might be completely blocked from doing what you want to and looking at picking up the scraps. This can feel rather combative for a Euro style game because of it.

Not sure I like how the rounds get shorter as the game goes on. I was surprised how much the later versions of all of the meeples really added to the game. 8.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: I think I'm past the idea that I would rate this a 10 by default, but this is a classic that I feel would need to be in my collection. 9.

Do I want to play this if asked: There's so much to still untap with the game and then adding in the expansion. 9

Overall: 8.99.

Rating Potential: High 8 to high 9. Variable set up helps push this past Puerto Rico in my mind, so that says something right there. This might be one of those games that I debate why it isn't a 10, and I simply can't answer it.

RATING: 8
Played 5-10 times. It´s a very good game, though I prefer games where you can specialize more. Here you need to have a bit of everything (almost). The game is almost thematic, except for some illogical restrictions that make the game harder to teach and learn: You can cook anytime but not bake bread. You can cook 8 sheep instantly but you cannot cook one lamb. All fences must be connected. And so on.

This game quickly shot up to the top of my list after only a few plays. I tend to fall in and out of love with games quickly but this one will remain at the top for the foreseeable future. The ever increasing need for more food in less and less time lends itself to some nail biting experiences! 

Update: I moved it down to a 7 cause the honeymoon wore off and because nobody will play this with me anymore :) After 21 plays I've never lost so that might have something to do with it.

RATING: 8.5
Possibly the only thing stopping this from being my favourite game is the amount of time and effort it takes to set up.  I love that there are a million little bits and pieces, and the game is very variable because of the way it gets set up, but it also takes 10 minutes to do so, and I can't always get a group of people to wait for 10 minutes while I set things up.  Many of the cards have never been used because there are so many possibilities, and so few are used in each game.

RATING: 9
An excellent game, best game in my collection (though War of the Ring CE scores higher, cuz it's hotter!).  Very busy, very complicated and quite challenging if you get a bad hand of occupations/improvements at the start (draft variants can help with this).  I often prefer the family version, as it's just easier to play (not to mention quicker), and I frequently play with newbies and non-game-geeks.  There's just no way I could spring the whole thing on them!

RATING: 7
Torn on this one. As a design it gets a 10 no question - almost infinite replayability combined with a system that puts a lot of pressure on the players and a satisfying theme. It's nice to watch your farm grow and expand. But a 4 rating would more accurately reflect how much fun I had on my first play. The game is basically Caylus, but here players have a hand of cards that give them unique bonuses when built/played and the scoring is more opaque. I think I'm just beginning to tire of games in which players are really playing the system rather than each other. There is screwage in this game (you can take actions someone else really needs) but most of that seems to be done inadvertantly; if you take actions you know someone else needs just for the heck of it you'll lose for sure. One question that remains to be answered is play balance: the cards one is dealt at the beginning of the game will nudge players to pursue particular paths to victory. But with so many paths and so many cards that help in this pursuit can the designer really have managed to balance ALL the cards/combos/paths? Given equal players is the game over from the first deal? So I guess (10+4)/2=7.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The first euro game I bought, as well as the only euro game I owned for almost a year.  I've primarily played 1-3 players.

What I like about it:
- Replayability with all the occupations and minor improvements
- Satisfaction from seeing your engine (farm) grow throughout the game
- No direct conflict but plenty of tension from action/resource competition and races to buy limited improvements
- Available actions are slowly revealed every round and the ordering changes every game
- Scales well across all player counts
- Family version makes it easier to introduce to new players
- Solo version offers an interesting optimization puzzle

What I don't like:
- It's more difficult to get to the table with more players because of the longer play time and stress
- The ending farm configurations start to end up looking similar after a few plays (Farmers of the Moor fixes this)

As of 26 Aug 2008, I've played a few solo games and 2 2-player games with my boys (7 and 9).  It's a good game but can be a bit fiddly with the card interactions. The Appendix helps with this greatly as it spells out which cards can be used with which other cards and when.  As a kids game, I can see it getting on the table for a while as both boys like the theme and creation aspects and can't wait to play again.  As a homeschooling parent, I see some math, resource planning, turn taking, possibly history if you talk about the 17th century hardships of farmers, and possibly more educational benefits of the game.

Bought from Kingslayer Comics.

The different occupations and minor improvements give a lot of replayability compared to Caverna.  They also give immediate direction.  It is much less a sandbox and more about survival.  Getting a food engine going is incredibly important and adds real tension to the game.  I thought that the disc resources would be lame, but they stack nicely and are rather convenient.

3rd best game of 2007 and my favorite heavy game.
Pretty heavy game. And I still remember when I had to learn it from rulebook, the rulebook is terrible. Those negatives aside Agricola is one of the best boardgames made, I rarely agree with BGG Rankings but here I do. Hardcore gamers can of course make it unfun with ridiculous amount of blocking, but just don't play with those kind of players and it can be fun. Very hard when you're learning it, but still fun. In some other designers hand it could've been point salad, but Uwe added story and concrete farm, making players care. And enough randomness -the cards really make the game, almost all the replayability comes from them. When I play 2p with my wife we play with 4 occupations&improvements, drafted - it's easy way to reduce option overload. Farmers of the Moor is nice alternative way to play with even more strategies but so heavy that we rarely use it. If you always play without cards it's a must though.

2-Player Comment:
* Agricola is great 2p game. Official fix: add the +1 all resources action card to 2p from 3p cards. It makes the game less unforgiving and opens new strategies. Drafting is recommended for experienced players.

Expansions:
+Agricola: Farmers of the Moor
+Agricola: The Goodies

Fun game, satisfying to build your farm, but bloody hell, is it ever fiddly... boards bits cards bags rules everywhere, constant replenishing of the board, unusual scoring system that rewards the little-bit-of-everything farm, so winning farms generally look similar... but the paths to get there are myriad. I think I'm a sucker for the infinitely variable yet similar game, and it has this in common with Settlers and Scrabble, my other favourite games. It has a super 2-player game, too.
Caved and bought the iOS version. Not bad, but got bored with it fast; even the good AI is pretty weak and the game plays slowly with many bots. And playing against other people online I've always found painfully slow.

Great game overall. Good art, production value, instructions. Plays tight, no real bash the leader problems, some randomness to keep things interesting, nice theme. 

Is it the best thing ever? I like it a lot, but it’s also long, suffers from AP, and the cards can be interesting or broken. Though it’s replayable due to randomness of cards (on board and/or if playing with in hand), it’s really the same every time. Stone Age and Caylus suffer from this as well. 

The biggest barrier to new folks is probably the timing of the fields - plant, sow, reap. Also, the feeding can be a problem. But after one play, maybe 2, people get it and then it’s back to normal Euro points optimization exercises. But I like cows, so there you are.

Literally, I cannot imagine NOT wanting to play this game. Have played with 1, 2, 4 and 5. Have now played with 3 as well, which was - again - a very different feel. Have introduced this widely to friends and gaming acquaintances. For only 2 has it fallen flat. Disclaimer: I translated the game into English.

Best game in my collection so far. Limited negative interaction, little or no (in the family variant) randomness, accessible to new players while offering advanced ones a lot of different options. Catchy theme nicely accompanied by worker-placement mechanic.

One of my favorite games.
The Pros: Amazing freedom of play (basically, you can pursue victory any way you want), high replay value, tension, indirect influence and/or interaction, tough decisions, no obvious path to victory... you could play this game and lose repeatedly and still enjoy it every time.
The Cons: not an easy one to teach to newcomers, long gameplay (though it doesn' feel like it), loads of tiny similar looking pieces, and this game is expensive (but worth it).

Played 1 time.
Last Played Sept 20, 2008

We played the family game version.  It was very fun.  I can see why this game is so well loved.  I can't wait to try it with the cards.  

It seems like a lot of rules at first but it is mostly intuitive stuff.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Plays fairly similarly every time.  Perfect games happen when you start a solo run, though possibly only when you pick your starting cards.  

Play using the Family rules for your first game.  It's much easier to learn that way.

Finally got to play Agricola! For me it's 'just another euro', but I like the laid back theme. And you want to do so much more, but can't because time is running out fast in this game. I like the 'non-aggressive' feel of this game: only blocking can mess with the other players, but you only block if the action also gives you something good.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Tight game with limited number of turns where every turn counts.  AP-prone players beware (me included)!  Thinking ahead is a must.  Huge selection of starting cards means you'll never play the same game twice because you'll want to tailor your strategy to maximize your card benefits.  Having to feed your family every few rounds can get stressful, but that's part of the charm and challenge of the game, i.e. you can't just go off and do your own thing.  You do get points for everything so there's flexibility, but the scoring system that subtracts points for not achieving baseline goals in each category also drives your actions.

Great 2p game.  No need to get Agricola: All Creatures, because this plays 2p fantastically.  And it's a game to grow into as there's a family game variant with simple rules.

My husband and I bought this two years ago and still play it. I fell like we can't play it too often because it would get stale fast. I think the game really changes up if you play with more people, but with 2 I feel like we often play the same game each time. I love this game, I love any game with a ton of pieces and a huge rule book. But I think we will look into some variations to make our gameplay feel more varied.

Brilliant design, excellent quality. Works well with 2 or with more. At first I was a bit skeptical but having played it a lot recently I'm convinced that it deserves its accolades.

The "Interactive Deck" with 4 players is a lot of fun and adds an extra level to the game.

Don't bother playing the 'family game' more than once.

I suck at this game! I love it anyway. To worker placement what El Grande is to Area Control, and I like worker placement games. Lots of variety in the cards -- improvements and occupations -- but if you don't get a set that really meld into a strategy for you they aren't completely necessary. Agonizing decisions on what to do when to make the best farm possible. I would give it that coveted 10 if scoring didn't make my brain melt. Thank god there is an app for that. Still that is part of its charm. Rarely will you get a perfect farm that doesn't loose some points for not having everything. You are constrained to doing the best you can. So hey, maybe I don't suck so badly, I'm just wanting impossible farming perfection.

I like this game. It is very tense; there are so many choices to make and not enough time or resources. It does have a bit of a learning curve; knowing the cards, how the rounds plays out, and what is essential. The downside is that I will never get my casual gamer friends to play this. It is just weighty enough that I will have to play with my gamer group. Overall, I wish this was one that I could see playing more often. Fun experience!

Place a circle on the board, grab some cubes. When you have enough cubes, turn them in for a scoring opportunity.

Farming?!? really?!?  I'm even from WI and was surprised by this theme.  It's a great worker placement game for 1,3~4 players.  It can feel a bit multi-player solitaire if you get too focused on your own farm, but if one watches the other farms, there is some great blocking strategy.  The game can feel a bit luck based when some of the more powerful cards are randomly dealt out.

Dropped my rating from a 7.75 down to a 5.75.  It's been falling steadily every time I play.  Why?  Way too much downtime, no player interaction and it feels too much like work.  You've got too much to do each round and that stresses me out, but not in a good way like how Amun Re or Medici stress me out.  Totally over this game.

I really enjoyed and now I'm dying to play the full game. 

I played the full game a few of times. It really becomes awesome - so many options. I think the hype was worth it.

I love how the cards make every game play different, as you value different actions differently as you play your occupations/improvements.

The funny thing: the family game is a lot harder as you don't have the help of the cards to improve the value of your actions.

Played last night: underwhelmed. We've determined to give it another go -- but my initial impression is that there's TOO MUCH to do and too little time to do it and everyone's always hungry and it takes epically long. I couldn't ever pre-plan a move because I had to wait to see if anyone was going to screw up my plans by taking the action I needed.

So frustrating and not in a good way. I was taught this (rather than reading the rules for myself) and it seemed so dang hard to get anything done that I was sure we were playing it wrong. I've since checked up and it appears he had the rules straight...

I want to be in the "i love it tooooooooo" club!

I am ranking this a little higher than my actual experience (probably the only time I've done this) to give the game some credit. I played a game with 5 - one game only - replete with sheep jokes that were stale from the beginning.  To be honest, I liked all the moving parts, but the game really didn't seem interesting to me until the last few rounds.  Watching the table, though, I should say that those who had played before did a lot better.  Hence, the credit which I think is deserved.  You probably need to play this several times to appreciate it.

Tight game with not enough time to accomplish everything you want to do. The occupation and minor improvement cards dictate the general strategy you will pursue for the game.

Agricola is certainly a fine game.  It is intuitive and the mechanics mesh well.  The theme matches the game systems in an extremely satisfying way.  My grandparents are farmers/ranchers... and the game goals seem to coincide with their life work and goals.

Agricola isn't ground breaking, however, and I feel a game needs to be this way to justify a perfect score.  When Puerto Rico came out it broke new ground and the gaming community rejoiced.

I have played two games now - once with cards and once without.  I think I prefer without.  After I get tired of playing the basic system I am sure the card mix will offer enough to carry the game through many more plays.

I played this once at Interactivity and found it well-designed and interesting to play.

I won a copy of this on eBay.de which included shaped meeples for the different resources and even a handsome Agri-cola bottle!

We'll see if I can ever get someone to play this game with me.  It looks like solitaire for the first time out of the box!

04/13/10 Played a five-player game. I'm glad I finally got to play it. But if I don't see it again for a good while that won't bother me. I guess if I'd played it before all the other worker placement / feed your people games I've played (Stone Age, Comuni, Pillars of the Earth, Le Havre, Rise of Empires, Shogun, Assyria, World Without End, and Roll Through the Ages)  I would have found it more special. As is it was like someone feeding you lunch only an hour after breakfast. The food itself may be good, but you just aren't hungry. Consequently my reaction was "eh".

RATING: 6.5
It's OK,it offers many strategies, variety and a nice implemented theme, but it is more a multiplayer-solitaire with very less interaction - great if you prefer playing games also alone. My girlfriend loves this game (I think, it's because of the theme).

Not worth of all hype it has generated. Pretty good still but the theme is repulsive and there is just too much going on for this kind of a game. Of similar games: Way better than Pillars of the Earth but a lot worse than excellent Caylus.  21.7.2008: Updated to '8'. This is both deep and surprisingly fun for this kind of optimization game. Still the theme buggers me...Update: 3.11.2008: Rating dropped to '7'. Still a good game and kind of flawless optimization game but just not my kind of a game.

Three plays. It's one of these fashionable type of gamers' games: place your worker to choose and claim your action and build on your own board. It's about optimizing your economy, optimizing your points. Solid game and challenging. However, my favorite games are those that have more interaction: besides optimizing your own points, also minimizing other players' score. There is too little of that in this game. And given the length of play, I am more critical. So no higher than a 6.5, I don't follow hypes so easily...

Maybe too cutthroat for my liking. Liked the game but sat 2 games with nothing to do, because all the spots where taken and all the other spots didnt provide me with anything since i had to feed my people. i didnt had much to do.

I like Agricola.  It's not the best game of all time, but it's a nice enough design to keep a gamer satisfied for the duration of a game.  

What I like best about this game is the cards that makes every game a little bit different.

Edit 15th july 2009 : After consensus from many gamer friends, we decided that Agricola should really be played only in the Family version (Without the cards).  It's a more strategic game that way and alleviate the "My hands sucks and yours is terrific" syndrom.  I would play Le Havre instead any day of the week though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very good game with lots of variation and therefore lots of replayability. My few niggles are that it's a pain to set up, doesn't have much player interaction other than blocking someone else's action and, in common with other Rosenberg games, feels like it's coming to an end just as you start to develop something interesting. I also think some of the additional decks are a bit frustrating and unnecessary, and that hand drafting should be the standard way of playing (though it doesn't help novices up against experienced players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As a late adopter, I probably missed the excitement about the originality of Agricola, and met it after playing a bunch of worker placement games which came after. Maybe because of this, during play there's always the unfavorable comparisons; this one is prettier, that one has way more options, the third is faster and more thematic, while Agricola is just ... solid. It works, does its job, enjoyable, but at this time it is just another worker placement game.

The thing I love about this game compared to other worker placement/management games is the "downhill" pacing that makes the experience morph as you play the game.  The turns start out slow with little to do and little stress, but as the game continues responsibilities, options, and stresses all grow to a comparatively fevered pitch, that is quite exciting and different than others I have played.  Also, the single player "campaign" is very smart, surprisingly fun, and has really helped me enjoy the game experience more.

I really enjoy playing Agricola. I don't mind the farming theme and the game-play is tight, rewarding both planning and flexibility. I love euro games and I can see why this one is a classic.

As I play more and more euro games, I'm finding that my enjoyment of any particular game has a direct relationship to it's complexity. 
~ as long as it's well designed and I have the time (and group) to play it

In other words, when it comes to euro games, "Heavier is better!" There may be a peak at which this changes, but I'm definitely not there yet.

Agricola is the heaviest game in my collection at the moment and it is also the highest ranked. I don't think this is an accident.

El juego tiene un par de elementos que penalizan, el no alimentar a tus trabajadores en los turnos de cosecha, y que tu granja al final de la partida no tenga "un poco de todo". Obviamente puedes pasar de estos requisitos, pero penalizan fuertemente en comparación con los jugadores que los cumplan. Para mi gusto esto lo hace restrictivo a la hora de explorar posibles caminos a la victoria con diferentes modelos de granja, algo que cambia en su juego hermano [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102794/caverna-cave-farmers]Caverna[/url]. Aún así, un punto a favor de Agricola con respecto a su hermano es la cantidad de cartas de sus diferentes mazos.

Going in with low expectations (primarily because of the hype surrounding the game), I was pleasantly surprised.

Just, well...., boring.

Maybe if played as the only game of the night & no others are played before or after, it might be better, but when tucked in amongst a lot of other Euro games that are invariably played during an evening of games, it's just lost amongst the vaguely more interesting ones.

Still, when played between two games such as say Le Havre and Macao, I will duck into the next room to send my missus a text that she is to ring me in 5 minutes and tell me there is an emergency at home that I NEED to be there for (such as re-arranging my sock drawer).

Gaming friend, Ozbrian, has created his own little pigs & sheep for this game, which if nothing else, are cute to look at, doesn't make the game any better to play though.

Rating based on one play with three players and one play with four players using the Easy deck.  I enjoyed it.  It didn't feel too long.  I liked the variety of actions.  I like the theme and the way it all works together.  That said, it doesn't grab me immediately and make me want to buy it myself.  I would gladly play it more.  The variety of the cards made it seem almost too variable to me.  What gets to me is that often I don't really care what action I take because it's just so variable that it's hard to plan too much ahead, so I care less about it.  I'm sure I'll play it more, but I could see my rating going either way, up or down.

RATING: 9
This will probably go up to a 9.5 or 10. I've not seen hype over a game like this for years. What sets this apart from the crowd is how tightly the game sticks to the theme - a true rarity these days for a "Euro" style game. And no "intermediate scoring" round either! My only concern is the relative power of the cards and whether you can get stitched up with a bad hand (e.g. 4 plough cards or all your minor improvements needing 3-4 training etc.). Hand drafting may solve this. It might also be worth exploring making sure everyone sees the cards to be used in the game at the start before having them dealt out.

L'Europe Centrale des années 1670. La peste qui sévissait depuis 1348 a finalement été vaincue. le monde civilisé est en reconstruction. Les hommes aménagent leurs chaumières et les rénovent. Les champs doivent être labourés, cultivés et finalement, moissonnés. Le souvenir de la famine des années noires a conduit l'humanité à manger plus de viande (une habitude toujours en vigueur dans notre monde moderne).

À partir d'un lopin de terre et d'une modeste cabane en bois, les joueurs jouent le rôle d'une famille de paysans qui vont tenter de prospérer afin d'avoir, à la fin de la partie, la plus belle ferme.

After few plays I think this game deserves the score of 9. The game is simple and complex, and if you do something wrong, you can't blame your bad luck, it's all your fault. Easy to learn, hard to master.

Also the solo play is interesting.

The game to show to someone who is tired of Settlers but love the eurogames.

New in collection jan. 08. First german edition.
Initial feeling after first two, much anticipated, plays: again, again!

Game grabs you rightaway. Combine that with the enormous amount of different setups (1-5 players, 3 different decks of cards for both occupations & attributes, each with lots of different possible starts & strategies, and a "family version" without the cards, and I can see myself playing this for years to come. It already has all the "expansions" right there in the box! Rating will probably only go up. 

Update, after 10+ games I think it's a brilliant game that I can keep playing throughout the years to come with various players. It keeps you on your toes without giving you too much headache.

Update after 30+ games: Still enjoy playing this, but it's gradually losing it's charm. Downgraded half a point.

Update after 5 years: Downgraded to a 6, because I don't enjoy it that much anymore and I probably won't suggest playing this in a while.

NL: Een van de favoriete spellen van mijn medespelers. Iedereen die Puerto Rico leuk vind zou dit moeten proberen. Goed spel voor 1 tot 5 spelers, met "instelbare" moeilijkheidsgraad.

When I first got this game, it seemed like I would really like it.  During the first few games I played, I believed that once I got better at it, it would become my favorite game.  But every play since then has made me like it less and less.  I'm not sure what it is exactly that disturbs me.  I love the idea of forcing the players to diversify their farms, and I feel that every aspect of the game fits really well with the theme.  The cards add a huge amount of variability and force the players to develop new strategies each time the game is played.  Yet something about it just doesn't click with me, and I simply don't enjoy playing it any more.  I know there's a good game in there somewhere, but at this point, I'm not sure I'll ever end up finding it.

RATING: 6
Good game with lots of choices.  The first play is tough if you are playing a 4 player game and you are the only one who has not played before.  Rating may go up with more plays.  My only concern is that the card mix may throw the game balance off.  Some cards are incredibly good, especially with the right combos, and some are not.

RATING: 8
I was very eager to try this highly rated game and after several plays I'm generally not impressed.  It's definitely a heavier game in that there is quite a bit to pay attention to and plan for at any given time.  That being the case, this game tends to be mentally exhausting for me, but doesn't feel adequately rewarding.  In most games where there are multiple point tactics, I can chose a few to really capitalize on.  Here, I feel like I'm punished if I don't try to do everything which ends up feeling more stressful than fun.  I will say that it is very engaging and does require good planning and decision making, but plowing through this for 3+ hours is just not enjoyable.

Update: I came back to this game after not playing it for about 2 years and really enjoyed it.  Looking for cool card combos and the timing of when to perform certain tasks was tricky, but it was nice to see plans come to fruition.  Maybe exposure to more worker placement games has made me appreciate this one more?  Still don't think it's my favorite, but apparently I like it more than I used to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game, although I can't quite put my finger on why.  I think it might be because it's so tough, because there's never enough time to do what you want, so you have to make the best choices you can.  And everyone's in the same boat.  A real brain-burner.

*Edit:  I think the reason why I enjoy this game so much, despite the brain hurt, is that it so SIMPLE.  Each action you can take is really easy to understand.  The game feels like it plays really quickly, and yet at the end you really feel like you have WORKED for your little farm.

What a punishing worker placement game.  I will not play this again without drafting the cards.  All the same I prefer other worker placement games as  not only can you not go with varying strategies, if you try to to focus on one path to victory you won't even do that well.  I like to be able to accomplish more in a game.

RATING: 4
This felt very much like Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small on steroids, which I guess is exactly what it is. Very tight - you need to do everything but don't have the actions, every inefficiency taunts you and the whole thing ends just when you start to get thing rolling.

I can see the appeal, though it isn't exactly what I'm after in a game - the interaction is chunky, the play is chunky and sequential, your goals are clearly delineated as is your paths to them - however you all end up nudging each other out of sync forcing them to do inefficient detours. I like things more opaque I guess, and with further reaching butterfly-effects. Of course, some of these may reveal themselves with more play but bah. I'll gladly play this, but it's my definition of a 7.

Also, the cards, I like the cards - and they add important variability, but you'd need to draft them for them to make sense.

A good game!

RATING: 6.5
An interesting worker placement game about farming.
The game is very enjoyable. You develop your farm, expand your family, get food, etc. You have to remember to develop in all areas to avoid negative points in the end of game scoring.

There is a mechanism where you have to feed your family or get negative points. This is disliked by some people, but I think it makes the game more realistic and tense. I heard Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small doesn't have that mechanism if it bothers someone a lot.

There is a beginners' variant where you play without cards. I would recommend playing with the cards from the beginning, because they add a lot of variety and not that much more complexity.

While I enjoyed it I wouldn't go out of my way to play it again.

Pre-ordered ... since December!

Updated: rated a 10 after 5 multi-player games and about a dozen solo. Just a good game: a wee bit brain burnerish but just enough. 3 and 4 player are my favorite thus far, but 2 and solo are excellent, too. 

Updated: rated a 9.5. I've been playing quite a bit and some of its luster wears off with a couple bad hands. Still a great game, IMO.

So far, dozens of single player (which doesn't help when you play multi), four 2-player, two 3-player and one 5-player. So far I think my favorite thus far is the 5-player. Really looking forward to a 4-player as I think that will be its sweet spot.

Updated: finally a 4-player game. Really tight game between three of us. I enjoyed it probably best.

1 October 2008 Update: Plays nicely across the board, even for one. I'm still keeping it a 9.5 but expect to lower it to a 9 after 30+ plays. Great game fo sho!

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Using a family of workers, build a home, plow and plant fields, raise animals and have children (to help do more work). Score points in all categories listed. 

Played as: 2,3,5 player

Played with: Vanilla, Farmers of the Moor + Through the Seasons

Pros: Ambitiously implemented theme. So many minor variables from game to game it'd be virtually impossible to find one way of playing that will work every time. Has a great pace with lots of different things to build up on your farm and it only seems to come together right as the game is ending. Any game where you get to build and admire an end product adds points.

Cons: If there is such a thing as an elegant game design, this is surely the opposite. The shear amount of cards (and often poorly written ones) leaves room for lots of questions and clarifications on any given game. No solid player interaction that I noticed outside of what actions someone else might take and if I should choose it first. The interactive deck didn't do a whole lot to add much eather, and what it did, certainly was not 'interestingly' interaction. Scoring is somewhat excessive. The worker placement mechanic is really the core of the gameplay and not all that original (not bad, but Caylus did it better). The cards and everything else that fleshed it out felt like tack-ons to add longevity to an otherwise good, but not great game. 

Other: This is a game that's all about the "strategy" while having basically nothing of lasting interest tactically. I think a big part of this game is what cards you start out with. Depending on how cards are distributed to ensure a fair balance among all players is the difference between a game worth playing to the end and one where the winner is evident before even the halfway point. I suggest using any method other then the deal and play style.  

Best Use: A gamers game for those who like a lot of strategic depth.

I was taught this game by friends who love this game and the enthusiasm rubbed off on me. 

I'm not sure what I like about it. Certainly I enjoy the theme and the light-heartedness of the game. I appreciate the many possible paths to victory and being able to build up your own farm.

Perhaps I find some perverse pleasure in the brutality of the game. There never seems to be enough turns, or enough food, and as soon as (or before) you start getting your farm working the game is over!

I'm not sure why, but it's a great game.

After 1 2-player game. Cute components and the theme is kinda sorta ok, but totally not my thing.  Lots and lots of little bits of information to assimilate, but it's all economic engine game and nothing else.  I like economic engine games when they involve non-spreadsheety things, like geometrical stuff happening on the board, timing issues, negotiations, etc.  I can't see any of those things in this game  yet.  It's too bad that these spreadsheety economic games are so popular on the geek, because I dislike nearly all of them.

Dec 2014 update - after 368 games on iPad:

Game is still fresh and engaging.

Jan 2014 -after 10 solo games and 30 MP games on my iPad.

One of the best games I ever played.

Reading so many good, raving reviews about this game, I bought this game for my iPad and wow, it is a real gem. 

Agricola is a such deep game despite the simple interface. Farming is never so brutal and tough. I was hugely attracted to Agricola and simply can't have it enough. I play solo as well as have usually 40-50 online games with 2-5 players running at the same time.

At first I try several family games as instructed, then try the cards. Game with the cards change some of strategies and ways of doings things in a game, which I feel overwhelmed sometimes. With E,I, and K decks I have almost infinite replayability which I really appreciate.

Pros: 
- It is a surprisingly deep strategic game, just like chess. With cards, it resembles Chess960, which have no fixed opening moves.
- Sense of urgency and quiet, fierce competition
- It is very thematic experience, you really like your farm.
- Multiplayer is very well implemented
- Although players take different routes to achieve things for their own farm, in the end all the farms look quite the same anyway. The joy lays in how you develop such a farm while trying to block others do the same thing.


Cons:
- You have to make difficult decisions all the time. Some less analytical people just don't like that.
- iPad version animates a bit too much.
- iPhone version is too small to enjoy, try it only when you are familiar with all cards
- The AI players are quite weak.
- The farm will look almost the same each time despite different ways of playing Agricola. Maybe one day I will eventually be tired of playing this game, but now I am definitely hypnotized.

Overall, a 10 for such well designed game with excellent theme, a game so versatile in strategies to win, with so high replayability.

Rating based on 6 solo games and one with my wife.  Being a gamer leaning to Ameritrash, it is not often I get into Euro games.  This is a delight to play - agonizing over plowing a field or building a fence has never been so much fun (for me). It is easy to learn, but the cards add a great deal of surprises and strategy. Quite fun to watch your farm slowly materialize as the game goes on.

Agrícola dispone de 2 modalidades: la familiar y la avanzada. Muchos jugones advierten que el juego es algo complejo y largo (30 minutos aproximadamente por jugador).
Es de los pocos juegos en los que la temática está muy bien reflejada en el sistema en muchos aspectos. Cada jugador representa una pareja de campesinos (marido y mujer se entiende) que intentan sacar el máximo partido de sus tierras, arándolas y sembrando en ellas, cuidando los pastos de ovejas, vacas y cerdos, haciendo reformas en casa o ampliando la familia (eso es tener hijos, no comprar más vacas). Al final del juego, se suman puntos de victoria por logros conseguidos y se restan puntos por cosas que no hemos conseguido hacer o por aquellos momentos en los que, después de una cosecha, no hemos podido alimentar a algún miembro de la familia.
Cada turno, empezando por el jugador inicial, decide que acción de las disponibles quiere realizar. Las acciones disponibles pueden ser las fijas durante toda la partida, junto con las que se van revelando turno tras turno, dependiendo de la ronda en la que se esté. Cuando un jugador decide hacer una acción determinada, coloca uno de sus fichas que representa a uno de los miembros de la familia disponibles y lo pone en la casilla (o carta) correspondiente a esa acción. Nadie más podrá hacer en esa ronda la misma acción (es el único factor puteo del juego en el modo familiar).
Esta mecánica recuerda muy mucho al Puerto Rico, mezclada con algunas otras como el Ciudadelas y el Pilares de la Tierra. El juego tiene 16 turnos, divididas en 9 rondas si no recuerdo mal, y la velocidad de juego va avanzando mucho conforme se va llegando a las rondas finales.
Tiene momentos divertidos cuando alguno de los jugadores ha calculado mal y no tiene fichas de comida para su familia después de la cosecha (carta de mendicidad por ficha que falte, que son 3 puntacos menos al final de la partida).
Mi valoración personal del juego es buena. Aunque este tipo de juegos me acaban aburriendo tras un par de partidas seguidas porque odio los sistemas en los que los jugadores juegan cada uno a su bola sin interaccionar directamente con el resto. Al final todo se basa en un sistema de planificación, cálculos y estrategias para sacarle el máximo partido a tus acciones por turno, que se trastocan continuamente cuando el resto de jugadores se adelantan en quitarte esa acción que tanto necesitabas. Aún así he de admitir que el juego tiene su gracia y su despliegue en la mesa es sorprendente.
El aspecto gráfico del juego no es una maravilla, pero es agradable y se lee con claridad qué es cada cosa.
La gran ventaja del juego, de ahí su popularidad, es que en su versión avanzada es muy difícil de quemar por repetitividad de las partidas, como le pasa al Puerto Rico. Y es que en el modo avanzado, aparte de haber unos pequeños cambios en las reglas, se pueden añadir hasta 5 mazos de cartas que en total suman más de 300: oficios, pertenencias, catástrofes... y que le dan ese puntito al juego que lo hace menos predecible y más variado.

This has been a 10 for me for a couple of years and it hasn't fallen.  Worker placement is one of my favorite genres and I love that there are so many paths to victory if you are able to adapt.  I like that if you have a rigid path in your mind you are going to fail.  Each turn the optimal move has to be reassessed as each person takes the tiles but I have never felt like there isn't something worth doing on the table.  As close as there is to a perfect worker placement game for me.

Don't own but enjoy playing it. Takes a long time to explain, learn rules, etc. Very heavy on resource management and very little interaction in terms of trading and negotiating with other players. However, lots of decision making in terms of deciding what you will do with the cards you are dealt and how you will place your "people" on each round. One of the most complex games I've ever played and really liked. Takes 2-3 hours to play with an extra 30 minutes to explain the rules to new players. After playing this one at a games night, I like to decompress by playing party type games.

Quick and fun game that I always enjoy, but after a couple of back to back plays, I need a break.

I remember being okay with this game during the very first playthrough, but on the second playthrough it started grating on me. When I play this I don't feel I get to do much fun, which is not the case at all with Caverna despite having the same amount of workers. I get that it's the card play that really runs this game, but since that part didn't stand out to me, I'm left to judge it by the worker placement, where I have a ton of games that do that part much better.

Definitely not for me.

Though in no way a simulation (or even a simulation of a simulation) of subsistence farming, it still retains the "feel" of doing just that.

Klasse Spiel, komplex aber gut. Mangelverwaltung und die ständige Suche nach ausreichend Nahrung. Je nach Besetzung manchmal ein wenig lang. Aber sehr dichte und spannende Spielatmosphäre. Der Glücksfaktor und der Erfahrungsvorsprung bei der anfänglichen Kartenauswahl (Ausbildung und kleine Anschaffungen) wird oft unterschätzt.

Played at XT's. Nice game with cool dynamics, clear that lots of thought has gone into the development of this game. Bloody difficult to win though. First time I've done this poorly in a game that I'm playing for the first time. Good for days when you feel like life needs to hand you a challenge.

My favorite game. I have over fifty plays on this with my wife in 2 player. Adding players is great too. It doesn't get old. I've been told Caverna is the same and a slight improvement, but I see no reason to "upgrade" because to me, Agricola is a perfect game. Once you know the rules you can play it pretty quickly, but if you want a longer more nuanced game you can add the cards which change strategies quite a bit. It has everything you could want.

This game is really fun to play.  I think the instructions are really poorly written and it is highly intricate a lot of rules to remember and a lot of different functions.  If you take time to thoroughly read through the instructions you will have a better go at the game.  It is one of those games that probably would be easier to learn if someone taught you because the instructions are not that easy to read.... there is definitely translation issues reading the English version rules.

Well, didn't set the house on fire.  The game was well-done but just seems too 'gamey'.  If my neighbor decides to plow his field, why can't I?  Do the seasons become shorter and shorter in 17th C Germany?  Why else do the number of rounds decrease?  Why does nothing bad happen- wars, taxes, illness?  I feel I've experienced most of the mechanisms before.  I can appreciate all the work on the artwork, but I'm not so fond of the style (on the cards, anyway).  I like Caylus better, but perhaps this beats out Puerto Rico.  Anyway, I can safely steer away from a purchase, but glad to have had a chance to try it.  There just is nothing new here: I hear all about how it includes 300 cards of which only a small subset are used: heck, Sierra Madre has been doing that for years.

Always feel like we've only just scratched the surface of it.  If it wasn't for the fact that we tend to like shorter games, we'd have probably played this a lot more.  There's so many cards that we haven't even attempted to play with yet because we're still getting used to the basic decks.  There's a fair bit of explanation required for a first time player to learn it, so you don't want to drag someone in who's half-hearted.  But once you get past that (and the long play time) it's a very enjoyable game.

This is a great game ... but I still struggle with the various strategies.  Even the family game has levels of complexity that defy easy understanding.  Reasonably simple mechanics and good theme/flavour but I find it hard to play well.  
The intro (family) game is both an excellent way to learn the game and is a good game in itself.  I recently played my first full game - which was very good but it only made my sense of personal inadequacy greater  :-(
I'll need to play this a lot more to be any good at it  :-)

This was my favorite game until we got the expansion.  I didn't think this game could be improved upon, but after playing the expansion I would say that it is slightly too important in this game to quickly expand your family, and that it is really hard to do well otherwise.  But I wouldn't have even noticed this without the expansion, and this is still a great game.  The additional action spaces keep the game balanced for scarcity of resources whether you play with 2, 3 or 4.  I like the family game, as it allowed us to teach this to my parents to get them comfortable with the mechanics of the game before moving on to the full game.  Scores ranged from 23 to 62, but everyone had fun because they were all building there own farms, and lower scorers were excited the first time they had no unused spaces. Once you become familiar with the basics, the cards add infinite variety.  This game is so tightly constructed, and everything you do makes sense intuitively.  A great theme that was incorporated perfectly.

RATING: 9
One of the most near-perfect game out there. Only gets better with repeated plays.
The variety of strategies that is boosted by the cards you get randomly each game is so excellent even without one of the many hundred expansion cards that could be gotten.

The only thing stopping it from a perfect score is that it's mentally taxing to play the game since it's very strict and unforgiving. It's also not something to play with newer players due to this and the complexity of explaining the game.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]04-Jan-2013[/u]: This has probably been the most played game I've owned within a short period of time - I'll have 30 plays within 3 months.  This is an excellent, heavier game.  However, I've mainly only played it solo and therefore the rating is probably a notch below what it would be if this was played more often with additional players.

The challenge and complexity seems like it would increase with the number of players.  I have played with my daughter, K, a few times and once with the whole family.  Hopefully, I'll be able to get it to the table with more people this year.

So, based on mostly solo plays, I think this is still a very good game in my collection.  It can be on the fiddly side with so many resources / little pieces to keep track of and add/remove from the game board every turn, but it's worth it.

After playing the family rules early on, I've found that adding in the cards actually make it easier to build up a nice farm.  The additional actions and bonuses they provide really help to guide you along a successful path.  So far, I've only played with the E Deck and I'm looking forward to trying out the others this year, both for the challenge and the added variety.

I have not found the common complaint about the stress to feed your workers every harvest as, to me, that is the goal of the game.  It's not to build the biggest and best farm.  It's to build an efficient, productive farm that provides for your family.

It has a long, slow burn over those first 10 rounds or so.  But the action really ramps up in the last fourth of the game.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]: This is a great game for solo or multiplayer.  However, the solo campaign rules didn't thrill me.  Playing a single solo session seems more enjoyable to me.  Great, tough worker placement game.

But the mechanics just don't do it for me and the game takes so long to play for such a simple game, it's just not worth the time investment, there are much better worker placement games to spend your time on.

Can't wait to break this one out. Looks like it lives up to the hype and has everything I felt was lacking from the great ACBaS

*edit Nov 7, 2012* Ok, wow. Amazing game. Probably the most fiddly setup/cleanup I've yet encountered. I think I may take a page out of my own book with Homesteaders and leave everything in its own plastic bag

Having said that, this game is what I hoped. It is ACBaS but with more to keep track of. Played the family variant and I really am looking forward to bumping up to the cards. I'd also like to play it with more than two, though two players was a really good time. So after 1 play, I say the hype is well earned

*edit Dec 2012* Played full version with wife. She didn't like it! Found it too stressful. Meanwhile, I thought it was fantastic and totally transforms the game into a true strategic resource manager. Also brings engine building into it much more. I can never go back. 

So now this game may not be played as much as it was. I still want to get her to try Through the Ages but that'll come later. Right now, probably Castles of Burgundy. 

I do want to get this game played one more time and see how she feels about it. I think she was just overwhelmed (maybe convincing myself that this is so!)

based on three plays so far.   I really enjoyed this.   I think it is less fiddly than Caylus, but with more going on in the game.   the theme seems to really fit this game as well.

*** Update May 2009 ***

i loathe the 5 player version and would avoid it at all costs.  i think the sweet spot might be 3 or 4 players, but the 4 player game seems a bit long for what it is.

really bizarre, but i have enjoyed my recent agricola plays less.  could simply be that in the Nov 2007 - Apr 2008 time period i played 25+ games of this and maybe i am a little burned out.  i find myself wanting to draft the occupations/minor improvements MTG style which adds a bit of length and can cause even more AP to break out.  

i expected that this would be a highly likely lifetime top 10 for me, but i do not think that is the case.  however, i really disliked Le Havre at first glance, but i find myself more intrigued.  

it is unlikely that i would ever turn down a game of this (except 5 player), but do not find myself looking for opportunities to play.

Mais ça fait plaisir d'y revenir quand même et de tester les combos de cartes !

RATING: 7
It's good. But not as good as [gameid=3076], or [gameid=28143], or even [gameid=13]. It's just a good worker placement game with a strong theme, that plays well for 2 through 5.

I get that it has like, infinite replayability due to zillions of cards. But [i]Race[/i] does zillions of cards better, because you actually get to see them, and the luck of the draw has a chance to balance out. (You know what, give me just a minute while I go change my rating on that to 10.) My desire to get better at [i]Agricola[/i] extends as far as learning to work the family game more efficiently; leet card comboz aren't going to take it any further for me. And without the leeching dimension of [i]PR[/i] and [i]Race[/i], there's just less here to learn.

The solo game rates an 'eh' - being able to let building materials pile up before you grab them just doesn't feel the same as the real game.

The farming - it's just a metaphor, right? This game could easily be about building spaceships. As one of the strengths of the game is that it requires tough choices, I believe that it is a good metaphor. But, is it the right one? Or, is the scoring system the right system to match this metaphor? In particular, I feel like food is a means to an end (not starving) and if I [i]don't[/i] starve, what does it matter how much, and what kinds of food I have remaining that I [i]didn't[/i] eat?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I believe that one of the main reason that this game is valued to high is the following: During the game you always want to have that extra action. There is never only one good option. So when the game is over, you want to try a total different strategy.

But the problem with the game is. In the end you always come to the same conclusion. The only good strategy is to spread the focus and try to score the least negative points.

Plenty of "action" cards are added just to make one game different from the other although it never feels very different.

Enough negativity. I like playing this game! It certainly deserves to be in the top 100 of games. But I don't like to start playing it, especially with new players. It takes like forever to set up everything in a manner that feels handy to every player.
You need to make good arrangements about who will add which goods at the start of the game so you don't get all confused during every refill phase.

Putting everything in the box is easy... but it takes some time to do that in an ordered fashion. So you hopefully spend less time setting up the next game.

One of my favorite games. It doesn't have too much down time, there are multiple ways to victory and the cards make every game different increasing re-playability.  The only thing is that every game seems a bit too short. But maybe that's good as there is just so many things I want to do and end up not being able to. Also scales down to 2 players very well

It is a good game that I am happy to own (including lots of unplayed expansions). Nevertheless, a recent play reminded me of how, for lack of a better word, silly worker placement and initiative are.

A fairly good worker placement game that can be a real brain burner when played with skilled and/or ruthless opponents.  A higher score would be recorded, but there is one Achilles' heel this game has, and that is a good or bad hand of cards can make the game a walk or an uphill struggle for a decent number of points.  Too bad, as this is a great game otherwise.

After one play, seems like just a very solid Euro. I think it will have some depth of strategy, many paths to victory with none dominating completely, and therefore good replay value.

However I see nothing very novel or brilliant. It's your standard collect resources, upgrade your stuff, build your engine, convert to points Euro game. For that reason for my tastes it's not deserving of the high praise it's been getting.

Have played this a lot in our group. After the initial fascination I have got a bit bored by it. I prefer games with more player interaction. This has some but it's limited to taking actions before other players that they might want and is often inadvertent.  Is really several separate games going on at once - one for each player at the table. Once the expansions start being used there is way too much happening to keep track of and the game becomes diffused and confused somehow. I also find this difficult to play if you are sitting on the wrong side of the table if the boards are upside down although this is common for a few games like this.

Very kind of the publisher to sell this game in one part and not splitting it with 2 or 3 expansions. You get a massive amount of cards, so it can´t get boring too soon. Furthermore it can be played solo really good, allowing to try some new tactics and card combinations. A really nice game, makes fun and sometimes I suggest it.

I put off buying the game because of the hype.  Then a friend brought it over and my wife and I both loved it.  Therefore, I HAD to get it.  My wife upgraded the components with clay animals and resources.  It really adds to the game.  Setup is a drag as well as the refilling actions each turn but once you get in a rhythm it is easy.

I was interested to play this, simply as everyone else was. The game exceeded my expectations. Whilst it is glaringly apparent that you are involved in yet another efficiency exercise, it is actually a pretty solid, light / medium weight game. It strictly follows the Euro blueprint, but there is some fun to be had here. I could not put my finger upon why though. I would consider Agricola to be the ultimate honing of the Euro genre. It is all aspects of that style fine tuned and perfected. Almost as if the designers looked at the top 10 games on BGG, and went through each and picked out the systems that made them popular to incorporate them into their new game. The game is varied and the decisions are not restricted to a choice between sensible and stupid. I found though that I was playing against the game rather than my opponents for the most part, it seemed that the only thing they did that affected me was choose an action, thus rendering it unavailable.  Certainly not the kind of game I would like to play all that often, but every now and again with the right crowd is not too much of a stretch.

* One of the best worker placement/resource management games out there at the moment
* Learning curve is steeper than some games, but rewards those who persevere
* Family game is a nice introduction, but the genius of the game lies in the card synergies
* Prototypical Rosenberg, as no one has enough time to do everything they want/need to do

* Game has become my go to solo game, as the series style is addictive and engaging
* Not much experience playing with more than 2, but does seem to bog down with 4+

Own the iOS version. Very solid gameplay. 

If the tabletop version is similar (and I haven't played it---so no rating), then I could see why it would be popular amongst serious euro players. It's a touch too dry and lengthy for me to give it a most high ranking (I'd give the iOS about a 7), but I can see why others do---unlike that of Le Havre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like to think of this as Oregon Trail v2.0: what happens once you get there (albeit a bit earlier in time; people are living in clay, wood, or stone huts).  In this game you start out with a small wooden hut and two people, and over the course of 14 rounds try to build up your homestead.  To generate food players must sow wheat/vegetables in fields or build pastures to house animals, which is then consumed by people in "harvest" rounds.  The game consists primary of choosing actions from a central board; each action can only be taken once a round, so there's a tremendous amount of fighting over the actions.  There are far too many actions that appear desirable each turn, so choosing the right actions is difficult (and a key part of the game's beautiful mix of tactics and strategy).  Players are dealt 14 cards at the start of the game that give rule-breaking abilities when played; some of them are very powerful (possibly unbalancing the game), and using them effectively is key to success in the game, yet very difficult (some have clear minor uses and are easy to use; many seem to not be worth the actions to play; some are game-winners, but only if used properly).  

Overall this is a very enjoyable brain-burning game.  The game takes a long time to play (all our games have been at least 2 hours), but when I'm playing the game I don't notice how long it's taking; I'm always busy thinking about my next move in the game or analyzing what other people are doing.  I played this game five times in the first week my friends got it; I'd say it's a keeper.

One problem that I've seen in the games I've played so far is that it's easy for players to slip into a subsistence mode, wherein all their actions are spent getting food to feed their people.  People in this mode barely scape by, meaning that no growth or point-generating actions occur.  This seems to happen a lot with a bread-baking strategy (as this strategy requires an extra action to get food from a harvest), and can be very frustrating for the players (as it's often unclear what they're doing wrong, but it's clear to them by halfway through the game that they're losing).

[Update: After 9 plays, I'm realizing that the cards that are dealt to each player at the start of the game are a major unbalancing force.  Regardless of whether the cards are drafted or randomly dealt, a single player can end up with a combination of cards that is powerful enough to severely unbalance the game (and, assuming they play the cards well, this unbalanced nature can positively amplify on itself).  In a game this long, and with this much strategy, it's frustrating to end up with a start condition that can potentially be so unbalanced.  Because of this I've dropped my rating from 9 to 6.5.  If there's a good way to equalize the cards at the start of the game this would easily go back to a 9 or 9.5.]

RATING: 9.5
One of the best worker placement games. The stress of feeding your family gives this game it's tension. With all the animeeples and upgraded peices, it really looks great at game end. I don't like the cards as much as others, so to give the game a bit more meat, the Farmers of the Moor expansion is required.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Obviously this is a fantastic game and I love playing it. I hope to play this one many, many times this year and I feel like my group is on board. I think the "family" game is tough enough to stay interesting for when we teach this game to new players, but I definitely am more interested in the full game and maybe trying out some of the themed decks. I like this just a hair less than Le Havre (playlist forthcoming).

UPDATE: though I've moved significantly away from this style of game, I still find Agricola has its charms and I particularly enjoy the country themed decks. Balance be damned. This is something I'd still be cool with playing at a pub over some beers.

I've played the cardboard version once and the app a dozen times now, even though I prefer the former.

A complicated game, but the theme makes it accessible, understandable and also appealing for a lot of people if you know how to explain the game using that theme.

A heavy game and I can find relatively easy opponents who want and know how to play: what a combination!

Combine a game of Agricola and Bohnanza on one evening and you will have that "first Settlers of Catan experience" feeling again (at least if that was your way into gaming), but so much better.

Uwe beats Klaus!

But that 999 Games rulebook sucks, reading this is one of the worst ways to learn a game.

Pick actions to improve your farm for most points.

Plays: 2.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources - actions.
Randomness: None (Base game).

Replayability: None, I don't enjoy efficiency engines.
Fun: None.  This isn't a game, it's a math problem. You have a number of actions that you are to order in the optimal sequence to maximise output. Your opponents are trying to do the same and to block your optimal actions, so the optimal sequence is constantly changing. All information is available, so you can always (in theory) solve the equation. Math problems do not make me smile.
Memorability: None, I can't get excited about building a farm. "Yay. My sheep produced offspring. And the grain is coming along fine from the fields. I think I'll go bake some bread." And if you strip away the theme, what am I supposed to remember? That player C's engine made 3 more points than mine?

Thematic integration: Strained.
Components: Functional.

Who will like this: Number crunchers.

I purchased this while still an undergraduate, probably later in 2009 - and played it once with a friend who had previously played it, and had three general reactions. 1) a very complicated game that doesn't lend itself to being taught easily to new players; 2) a sad game as you choose between feeding your kids or upgrading your oven; and therefore 3) a game that sat unplayed on my shelf for years before being sold.

I mostly don't like Euros but tried Agricola for the first time. Wasn't too painful as other Euros I've played but it was too long. Theme works for the most part but so what? Fairly dry (farming isn't a fun topic for a game let's face it) and would have been worse but I have a fun gaming group who keep me going. Too many choices though which has you playing the system rather than having fun. Very little player interaction, a common problem with many Euros.

Typical of so many Euros where the process is the thing. The more complicated the better. Designer's of Euro's like this just don't seem to understand that games should be fun. Not work.

Games like this are not accessible to a broader audience and in fact will put most people off gaming.

By virtue of my 2015 10x10, I've been able to play Agricola several times recently. It's been great to really explore the game not only with my gamer friends but also playing in family mode with my daughter (who now declares it her favorite game). I've enjoyed the solo mode quite a bit as well.

With more experience, the game has ceased to be stressful and has instead turned into a tense challenge with new twists each play. I've especially been enjoying what the Farmers of the Moor expansion brings to the game.

I've also come to realize that Uwe Rosenberg is probably my favorite of the big Euro designers, and (for the moment, anyway), this is my favorite of his games.

RATING: 7
Excellent Eurogame, however the scoring seemed a little odd to me (e.g. It's better to have lots of empty pens than a few full pens with a couple empty fields) and it penalizes specialization over diversification.  Also, I like a little more player interaction than just blocking what they would like to do.  Sometimes you can get a very bad hand of cards which really straps you if another player gets a good hand, but still my one of my favorite Euros.

Not a fan of how punishing the game is.  My one play was spent the entire game just trying to get on my feet.

Actually not as dry as I thought it would be either.  Overall, I may end up enjoying it enough, but it will never be my favorite with the gameplay being so punishing.

Ez pont az a klasszikus, amit minden valamit magára adó társasjáték rajongónak ki kell próbálnia. 10 év múlva is várhatóan a legjobbak között lesz (marad).

with all the hype and critisism surrounding this it was nice to get hold of it and appraise it. Well, nice contents, although animeeples would be nice; rules at first seemed really complex but then they just dropped into place and actually it's quite a simple game. Played solo and found it really quite hard to score(only scored 23 points which I think may be a bit rubbish) This is a really multi-player solitaire, I can't really see it having a lot of player interaction as you just concentrate on your own little farmstead, but I don't have too much of problem with this. Initially a solid 8 but I'll see how it goes.

RATING: 10
Our favorite game. I got it a few months after becoming a board game geek, my wife and I fell in love with it quickly. I love the blend of tactics and strategy, the crucial decisions that need to be made and the variety that the cards add.

I've since pimped my Agricola like crazy: animeeples, veggimeeples, the X-deck, L-deck, O-deck, Through the Seasons, stickers for my family members, player boards with new artwork, and finally Farmers of the Moor. I even bought dice and made my own copy of Agricola Express.

This is one of very few games I feel I could play competitively (the 2-player game at least.) 

2015 update: we don't play this much anymore, but it will always be very special. When we were new to the hobby, there was a long time where, every time we sat down to play something, it was "Okay, are we playing Agricola? Or something else?".

Love it. After my first two games, I decided to wait for the English edition (it wasn't even announced back then), then decided I can't wait: I must get this now. So I bought the German edition, made some Finnish paste-ups... It's just that good.

I've played mostly the family game so far. That's good - you don't necessarily need the cards. It's good with my wife as a two-player game, lovely with gamers as a five-player game (though a tad long that way)... Like W. Eric Martin said, Agricola combines an experience game and an engine game, that's most likely what makes it so sweet.

The game's a tad too long with five. I'm reluctant to play it with four newbies, two hours is just too much. I prefer the game with less: a three-player family game goes easily in an hour or less.

Enthusiastic (with two players, no cards and maybe Farmers of the Moor).

Great game. Only complaint, it takes a long time to play, and that's mostly because it takes forever to set up everything That being said, every time I finish I think how fast the time went.

RATING: 5
The widespread adoration of this game borders on madness. There is nothing about it that draws me back. The best part of the design lies in the varied and copious Occupation and Minor Improvement cards, which fortunately keep the beginning of the game—and the rest of it too for that matter—from becoming formulaic.

Not an easy game to learn: even in the family version a new player still needs to know the Major Improvement cards well. Other significant quibbles: the less-than-good rules set, the sprawling, cumbersome layout, the okay but could have been better art design, and the constant, increasingly fiddly upkeep. [10 plays and done?]

This used to be an 8 for me. Great game, but if anyone suggests we play it I suggest Caverna instead. The lackluster theme and the constant struggle of starvation make this one secondary to Caverna.

This with the expansion is still one of my favorites. I particularly like the card drafting variant which for me is a mini game all by itself. It also allows for a more balanced game and more strategy. In contrast to some others I really like the struggle to feed your family - the dark ages weren't a picnic!

The best thing I can say about Agricola is this - I recently took an extended vacation from gaming because life just got terribly busy and I didn't have much time for fun stuff.  After a couple of months of not playing games, the game I most found myself thinking of and wanting to play was this one.  And even though I lost horribly, I had a wonderful time playing, and it pretty much got me interested in games again.  So, there's that.

RATING: 8
Playing Agricola only once in a while, I had come to find plays felt overly similar, and this rating might have gone down to a 6 briefly. As others have noted, successful farms are all going to look pretty similar in the end, so it's hard to feel like you've pursued a new path strategy at the end of any game. [i]Once again, I'm expanding my home, growing my family, and getting at least one of everything. Yay.[/i] The game severely punishes any attempt to stray too far from this formula, as I can attest from my many, many losses.

For another game, that might have been the end of the road, but Agricola has at least one saving grace. First, it's got the cards, which give widely ranging incentives to shift how you achieve your goals (even if those goals are ultimately the same in every game). In addition to the variety inherent in any game that's got hundreds of cards, there are also varying degrees to which you can incorporate the cards into the game, ranging from the family game (no cards) to using a "power deck" (all the most powerful cards). Much to my surprise, I enjoyed the former quite a bit and found the latter [i]still[/i] punished you for playing too many cards. There's the free Through the Seasons expansion here on BGG, other decks available (WC and G are reportedly the best), and of course the Farmers of the Moor expansion, though that severely lengthens the game.

Speaking of game length, that is probably the main limiting factor for Agricola. I have found 3-player games test my patience for the exercise of cube conversion, no matter how many fun cards you have, and I am therefore very hesitant to try it with 4. At two players, the game is just an hour, which is perfect, but both players are obligated to go for livestock, which does narrow the strategic variety in the game. Nonetheless, I haven't tired of it at that count, and I remain interested in seeing how the many variations in cards and incentives play out.

RATING: 5
As venerable as this game is, and as devoted its following, I just don't care for it.  It suffers from the "dead man walking" flaw that plagues many a Eurogame, wherein a failure to perfectly execute a strategy early on dooms a player to failure without realizing it.

(I know some Eurogamers probably consider this a feature, not a bug, but I try to avoid those people at parties.  :D )

I will say that the artwork and components do a very nice job of giving the game a solid setting - you actually feel like you're farming, ranching, building, etc., instead of just shuffling tokens around the board.

I will probably give this one another chance or two, given how much people love it - it might be that I've undervalued it.  But for the moment, it's middle of my pack at best.

I think persons in my family would enjoy Caverna over Agricola based on my playing of Agricola and the reading of this excellent thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1179158/will-you-prefer-caverna-or-agricola-review

I bought for iPad to learn the rules. I need to see if my wife would like worker placement. She doesn't like too complicated of games, or ones that take a long long time. 

Just picked up for $33 on Amazon. Lowest price ever according to CCC.

Old collection

This is a rather complex worker placement game in which the theme really fits the game. You really feel like being a farmer trying to harvest his crops, nourishing his family, improving his house... at the end of the game we're always left with the feeling: I still wanted to do this and I wanted to finish that, and if only I would have... It always seems like you need a couple of more rounds to finish your work completely making you want to play the game again and again if only it didn't last that long.

It plays well with 2 players too and the game doesn't last that long then. We also bought the 2-player edition of Agricola but it doesn't give us the same 'wow' feeling that we have when playing the original. Maybe that changes with the 2-player expansion.

It's not cheap but you get a box fully packed with nicely crafted playing pieces! I didn't like the follow-up Caverna as much as it is not as tight as the original Agricola game in my opinion. For years, this was our favorite game but it doesn't get played as often anymore.

Cool game i only played with experiences played so i never won, i like the mechanics but i don't enjoy the theme of the game , maybe because, i never harvested any field :P
The game is a classic worker placement with a lot of possibility due to multiple set of cards you use during the game.
Apart the worker placement , i think there are some move you must make to win the game or those moves really helps and also the randomness of the card drafted among other players may favour the persons with better luck and of course better experience than you 
So for me it's a good game but only for a 6.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Too many options sometimes makes you wonder why you should choose. Also two bottle necks in most strategies (building fences and plowing) give it an awkward gameplay.

Edit: As expected rating increases as this game gets more playtime. It's all about timing and card combos. But then again this view may alter again after some more games. Anybody interested?

An incredibly tight, strategic, and tactical game. But I do not enjoy playing it. Even when I'm doing decently in this game, I feel like I'm making all the wrong decisions and locking myself out of everything. Certainly a great game for some, but too punishing and restricting for me.

I played "Agricola" with my brother and my buddy. I want to try it again because now I have a little feel for it. At first glance, I really dislike the complexity of the game. There is a terribly steep learning curve, which is usually an indication of a bad game for me. It lacks elegance because of all the obtrusive text on every single card (and there are tons of cards) and all the minutely detailed rules. There are also too many components and too much book-keeping. Nevertheless, buried beneath all of the clutter and confusion, there seems to be a very fun game hiding. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Even if you don't win, you feel the satisfaction of building up something during the game.
It starts slowly with everyone having a lot of options to choose from and no set strategy yet. This can be intense. During the game it becomes easier to make the choices and the fun increases.
2.5 hours with 4 players.

Excellent game with lots of variations to keep it fresh. Almost a ten, but the luck of the cards still keep it in my book from being a perfect game(The whole, one game you rock, the next you are destroyed) Sometimes there is just little to mitigate the bad draw and you just have to live with a bad game(unlike TtA where it's easy to mitigate by just letting the bad draws fold away). Tis the way with most card games, not a flaw, just not "perfect".

It looked overwhelmingly complicated at first (so many wooden tokens!), but the rules are pretty logical. Somehow doesn't feel very competitive - I actually like to see everyone's farms do well. That's not a knock against it - sometimes it's nice to play something a little less cutthroat.

This is not the end-all be-all of games. Personally I have to find the right people to play it through to it's finish. Great concept, thematic appropriation, and execution but too much punishment or frustration of needing one more move to execute the move you wanted to achieve. Main strategy is to populate your family ASAP, oh but don't forget to feed them. FMG

This rating is based on only one 5 players games. All newbies to the game including 1 non-gamer (which really hated the experience :) ).

At first it is confusing because there are  sooooo (too) many things in there. But after a couple of game turns you understand the game mechanics. 

Do we really need 200+ unbalanced cards ?

In the end...  way too long but kinda like it but will clearly not buying it but have to at least play it again after the tedious learning experience.

Great game.  I feel like it does lead a little bit to analysis paralysis, but in a sort of fun way.  If you end up getting to slow a game it's no fun, but show me a game where that's not true.  The beginning really captures the stress of trying to do a million things at once.  There's food to get, babies to have, houses to build, and cards to play.  A lot of the game is making early sacrifices to supplement a powerful end game.  It's not a play every-day sort of game for me, but most of the good ones aren't.  Very fun to watch as different players branch out on different strategies.

Okay, I'm on the Agricola bandwagon.  I'm not sure I can say much that hasn't been said, but this is a very fun game, even without animeeples.

Update- Keeps getting better with each play; I've upgraded my rating to a 10.

Another update (1/2015):  Don't have time to play with gamers much anymore, so I bought the iOS app - awesomeness!  Also tried playing with the family rules and my pre-teen kids; works for them, too.  Good family game, as everyone pretty much does their own thing, so not a lot of hurt feelings- maybe just a little annoyance if someone grabbed an action you wanted.  And the family game is a gateway to the real game.  I think this has moved into being my favorite game ever, partly because of the variety provided by two sets of rules and different decks of cards.

I like this game but it can be a real brain burner and really bad about analysis paralysis.  Worker placement is really competitive and can bump your plans from A to B to C really quickly.

I know this is a highly rated game, but to me it was a strategy game that didn't allow any long term strategies to ever succeed.

Mikor tudomást szereztem a boardgamegeek-ről, azt tettem amit gondolom mindenki más: megnéztem a top játékokat. Az Agricolát itt szemeltem ki magamnak, hazudnék ha azt mondanám a kis állatok nem játszottak szerepet.
Viszont azt kell, hogy mondjam, túl nagyot ugrottam (első 5 társasom között van talán). Nekem még ugyan nem jelentett nagy gondot, de a családnak úgy tűnt, túl nehezen emészthető, pedig csak a családi verzióval játszottunk. Ezért félretettem, hogy később majd előveszem. Lassan lehet megérett a dolog?
Addig is 7 pontot ér nálam de kap +1-et a sok mütyür miatt. Bár itt most meg kell jegyeznem, hogy nekem hiányzott 3 fa korong és az egyik bárány mozgássérült volt (nem volt lába, majd töltök fel fotót). A Szellemlovas kérdés nélkül pótolta illetve cserélte! Csak bosszantó, hogy egy ilyen drága játéknál (vagy úgy egyáltalán) előfordul.

Társasjáték világnap alkalmából előkerült egyik jó barátom kérésére. 4-en játszottunk, rajtam kívül mindenki újonc, és én is csak családival játszottam 2-szer, 2 fővel, most viszont durr bele minden! Hát azt kell mondanom WOW!! 4-en, kártyákkal, barátokkal, mekkora különbség!!! Viszont legközelebb draftoljuk a kártyákat (a győztes keze nagyon tápos volt), bár már így is 3 órán át játszottunk.. :P

There's a reason why this game is so high in the rankings, it is an absolute classic. Was undecided about whether to buy it for a long time as it was supposed to be very complicated and some people complained it was a lot like work. I don't agree with the latter, and only partly with the former - it isn't a simple game to pick up but once you do it is fab. No luck, pure strategy. Lots of variety, replayability. Lots of people don't like as 2 player but we play mostly 2 player and really enjoy it.

At the time of this writing, Agricola is the new #1 on BGG.  Does it deserve it?  Well, that is for each of you to decide.  For me, Puerto Rico is a better game overall and deserves the #1 spot.  Aricola is a great game, however, it just not better than PR.  Let's get the little stuff out of the way--the components are fine (I don't need animeeples and cubes work just fine) but not outstanding.  For example, the cards could be of thicker and better stock.  Also, the rules are not as clear as they could be.  These are minor points.  The real test is gameplay--and Aricola, again, measures up great--just not better than PR.   I will say that after several plays, I much prefer Agricola over Le Harve.  Although both are frustrating with their "if I just had one more action"--Agricola is a much better game IMHO.

A brilliant game from start to finish.
Build the best farm to win the game but make sure you feed your family, otherwise you're going to lose a lot of points.
Great level of depth, but rules are straightforward, so it's very accessible.
Highly recommended.

What could be better than building your own farm? The basic rules are grasped fairly easily, but the tactics for winning can take a long time to learn. New players will be destroyed by more experienced players, but they can also mess up more experienced players plans by making sub-optimal moves.

I love the base game, a lot of strategic fun, I don't ever feel like I know what I'm doing, but seem to avoid the begger cards regardless.  The cards are a bit random, but do help direct your tactics to something different from the other players, but can cause some unbalanced capabilities.

I've played with the expansions and dislike everything added by them.

A good game, but I got sick of having to constantly move around all the pieces every turn.  I also found that it was quite mentally draining, without there being enough of a "fun factor" to compensate for it.  A good game, overall, but a little overated in my view.

Standard worker placement
Light strategy, the gist of it is to build an engine that is capable of feeding your own people (self-sufficient) and focus on producing a type of good that allows you to score high at the end of the game

Scoring criteria forces all players to almost play the same way. Penalty is very harsh and the lack of proper planning in the 1st few rounds can really cripple the player.

A very fun game even though every play hasn't gone that well for me. I'm blaming the poor mix of Occupations and Minor Improvements that have been dealt to me. It seems the winner of these games was able to combo together his/her Occ & Minor Imp. Our next play will use some of the optional rules for redrawing these cards.

RATING: 5.75
I absolutely respect the design of the game.  The theme integrates well with the mechanics; after all, you get to see how your farm evolves throughout the game!  In addition, I like the fact that the many different cards bring a lot of variety to the game.

On the other hand, I don't like the scoring system.  You're almost forced to have a very balanced farm at the end of the game; I feel like there would be more variety if one could successfully specialize in some areas and ignore others.

But the biggest negative for me: like a lot of others, I don't like feeling like I'm always struggling to feed my family.  There's just too much tension in there for my tastes.

RATING: 7.5
Agricola has good mechanics, interesting use of the occupation and round cards and isn't as fiddly as some here on BGG have said. It has low downtime (assuming low analysis paralysis) and plays inside 90 minutes. The production values are good. The theme is meh but not fatal. I usually like worker placement games.

So why don't I like the 'gric? 

In summary, it feels like being a contestant in Iron Chef but the contestants need to continually reconsider their menu because all their required ingredients are scarced and randaom and could be snatched away by the opposition and their team. Agricola's scoring system requires that, like Iron Chef, you need to serve a 3 course meal around and unreliable supply of ingredients that may never be available to you. Add in that in Iron Chef that you're team of cooks may spit in the food if they're not paid every 10 minutes they are working and there you have Agricola - a headache more than a fun game. 

I'd definitely play Agricola if someone badly wants to play, and I think any dedicated gamer should try it at least once, but I wouldn't push it on the table myself.

>>Updated to a 7.5 after playing the iOS version over the holiday season and with some friends. Although there are lots of occupation and improvement cards that are said to make the game a unique experience, that is only partly true. There are some cards that are vastly more powerful than others while there are some cards that will never get played due to their insane resource requirements (improvements) or high level of dependency on events occuring in the game (occupations). The one aspect that does make the game interesting is the random emergence of the action space cards each turn, which does keep the players guessing and struggling to position themselves for the most useful actions at just the right time. Overall, though, the game is largely about getting in earliest on the house building and family growth without starving while other players do the same within the scarce actions available. This part of the Agricola definitely isn't new. Newbies who aren't familiar with the timing of when grain, vegetables and livestock naturally grow and become available before and after harvest, as well as how to time their actions around those factors will get trashed by the more experienced players. Agricola also seems very prone to analysis paralysis, so don't expect a short game with inexperienced or anxious players.

Was it all hype over substance? Not altogether! It is a godd game but you need to be careful when selecting which card decks to play with, as mixing them together can unbalance the game.
Personally I think the game is a bit too long.
After playing with 5 players and the Farmers on the Moor expansion, my fears have been realised that this game is way too long. I feel that game is really a group of people sharing a board but playing their own games with minimal interaction, and for such a long game, it doesn't work for me.

Great theme; it's always fun to watch your farm grow. Also surprisingly intense. You never seem to have enough time to do everything you want, which is something I really like about the game. Cards provide a lot of variety in strategy. Always willing to play. Only downside is that it does take some time to set up and to continually put resources on the board. 

Played: 20 times.

Highly enjoyable, the mechanics match the theme, so the game is not abstract. You don't move some markers to get points, you just have to develop your farm and take care of your family. It appeals to most of players. Setup is a bit long, but thanks to MANY cards each game is different.
Good for 2 players!

Rating based on a single play at UK BayCon 2008.  We waded straight into the advanced game which by some fluke I managed to win (could have been the excellent teaching by Steve K!)

I have to say that I can see what the buzz is about - a great game that I suspect may go up in my opinion after a few more plays.

Update after three plays - an easy 10!

I quite enjoyed Agricola without loving it. I can get into the development of my farm and I really like all the decisions, even if they can get a bit overwhelming at times. 

What I dislike though are the bland look of the game and the fiddly nature of all the bits and the micromanagement that is required. I think this game would drive me nuts if I owned it...hence I don't.

I don't buy the animeeple argument as a cure for the blandness either. It won't change those bland boards and wooden animals...really...don't go bagging miniature painters now you Euro folk. :P

I find seeing my farm grow in front of me rewarding and that's almost enough in itself to make me love the game, but added on top of that you have the difficult decisions weighing up which way to push your farm, the tense moments where you struggle to scoop up that final food for the harvest and the subtle but pivotal player interaction.

And that's just the family version. The full version makes the game even better, with so many more choices and so much harder choices.. The only thing I don't like is that seating order can have quite an impact on the outcome in some groups (some people are more bothered about taking the starting player token than others), but a house rule quickly fixes that.

RATING: 7
An exciting thought provoking game. Agricola ensures that none of the games you play are the same as variations of the round cards are revealed differently in different games played. What I enjoyed about this game is the micro-managing aspect of your farm, and the constantly changing tactics that you must employ to ensure that you use up for farm space whilst simultaneously not accumulate negative points by allowing your family to starve. 
I love every single thing about this game from the occupation and lesson cards all the way down to the adorable sheep, pig and cattle meeples.
This game however is not for someone who is looking for a quick game, just like real farming this game requires a lot of thought, planning and strategy to ensure the most effective yield for your evening.

Tras la impresión inicial pienso que 

-hay otros juegos de colocación de trabajadores menos trabajoso a la hora de reponer 

-hay juegos que ocupan menos mesa.

-las cartas algunas son demasiado potentes y otras no te valen prácticamente para nada.

-hasta bien avanzado la partida no dispones más de dos peones y con suerte

Estos problemas hacen que no me concentren en la partida, de todas maneras sigue siendo un buen juego pero para mi gusto prescindible.

I've also played a couple dozen games solo, though I haven't logged them as plays.

The core gameplay seems, in many ways, to be a distilled version of the resource manipulation and worker placement that I enjoy in Puerto Rico and Caylus (also Homesteaders), with a dash of the action crunch from Princes of Florence.

The solitaire game is a fascinating operations research puzzle.  The two-player game, at least the family version, is not quite as tactile as I had feared it might be, but perhaps that will emerge after a few plays with the same opponent.  Multiplayer, at the level I am at, seems to be won by whoever is best able to execute the plan that they've come up with despite the interference (deliberate or otherwise) of the other players.

Played 6th time.  This game is challenging but what it is missing for me is called 'Fun Factor', which rates around 2 on a scale of 1-10.  It's just a game that doesn't click with me.
I can't seem to put together a hand of cards (even with drafting) that give me an advantage.  That aside, I can still get a decent score.  But I do find the game tedious rather than fun.

------------

Agricola is an OK game, NOT a great game.  Granted I've only played it 5 times, but I don't see what all the hype is about.  My opinion of it may go up with more game plays.

It has the worker placement mechanic of Caylus, but with less workers to be placed, and with many more options.  And you thought Caylus caused AP.

Even though I'm not crazy about the 'farming' theme, it is well integrated.

There is the In the Year of the Dragon feel to it of, don't starve your family.

And there is the Race for the Galaxy similarity of, I have all these cards and don't necessarily know if they can benefit me at all.  As well as minimal player interaction.

The game forces you to be constantly thinking about your available optimal choices and strategies, and readjusting them constantly as your preferred choices are snatched up by other players.  This is GOOD!

However, I do feel that given equally skilled players the one with the better cards will win.  Unless the card distribution is evenly weighted amongst the players.  And I can say that in the 5 games I have played, this is a 50/50 chance.

I can't really say how much I like this game. It's heavily themed, and the mechanics are many and pretty involved, and yet it plays in a very simple and intuitive way. You can play in a lot of different ways and it rarely feels samey even after a lot of plays, expecially if you change the number of players from one play to the other. And it is a blast to play no matter how many people are sitting at the gaming table. A masterpiece, one of the onlw few games that I could play twice (or even more!) in a row, and probably the best (non-war) boardgame I've ever played. Fantastic.

This game requires some long term strategy and short term tactics to succeed. Everything is rolled up in an immersive and captivating theme sprinkled with just enough luck and randomness in the cards to help this one stand out among the rest. 

The game takes several plays to understand how to play effectively which may turn it off for some. For those patient enough to stick with it, the game gets better with every subsequent session.

My favourite game. I love the fact that there is randomness in the set-up (both on the board and with player card hands), but almost no randomness in the actual play. This is a skill game with alot of room for improving your game, which I also like. Downside is playing time (if you teach it to a new group, a 4-player game might take 3+ hours) and also the set-up and tear-down takes some time. But the playing experience, with the food tension etc, is fabulous.

I enjoyed my first few plays of this, but it's not a game that's easy to return to after a month or two on the shelf. I'd like to try it again at some point, but I'm not a fan of how rigid the scoring tends to be. Plus the wording on the cards wasn't translated well, so you're constantly needing clarifications on things.

Would rather play Tzolk'in for a similar experience.

First review: only played 3 times so far. 2 solos, and 1 4-player. All vey interesting, first two (solo) plays were with errors. First multi-player game was, I think, all okay. I'm loving it right now, like my first game of settlers.
So many options - seems like endless possibilities at this early stage -I look foward to the next game.
Second review: have now played a handful of solo games and similar number of multiplayer games (2, 4, and 5 players). The game still seems excellent at each level. I'm particularly impressed with the solo player, since I've never played a game with such interest in solo play. Even without the cards its quite a head-scratcher, i.e. playing the basic game.
Our game group is loving this at the moment - the theme, the INTERACTION, and the tough decision making is all really fun, fun, fun. I hope it stays this way, or matures well at least...
Third review: A few more solo and multiplayer games under my belt and I'm thinking about this game all the time!
I just want to keep playing this game, but my lifestyle wont allow it. I have responsibilities. Damn!
Fourth review: Still the main game, rarely do we play anything else, and we're all still learning about how to get better. No-one in our group has yet scored above 50 in a multiplayer game, but we're edging closer.
Summary: This game is FUN. It has replayability in spades, is for 10+ I would say, as it requires some considered thought for decisions on actions. If you collect games, then you should own this. If you enjoy many Euro's you will most likely love this. If you are more into killing things, well you might find you still like this one - you can slaughter your animals for food! Ignore the multiplayer-solitaire fuss, and the one-v-multiple strategies. Find out what you think for yourself. You can play on-line as a try-before-you-buy. 
For me, this is a clear 10 right now, and I think will remain so for a long time to come - we haven't moved off the Easy deck yet!

RATING: 9
One of the best worker placement games. The tension of having to feed your family and diversify your farm, while still specializing enough the score points is great. Lots of interesting decisions. I do think it is best played with the drafting (7 Wonders Style) or occupation and minor improvement cards at the beginning of the game.

RATING: 6
I respect Agricola's design and understand its popularity. The different actions have a concrete meaning and are part of a natural flow. (To harvest you need to sow and to sow you need seeds etc.) However, the game feels overloaded by special cards that risk "playing the players" and since it's a point salad where everything scores in the end, it's difficult to assess the many actions.

主題:1
再也找不到比農家樂更切合遊戲規則及主題的桌遊了，本遊戲由我最欽佩的桌遊設計師烏玫瑰山所設計，遊戲中玩家扮演一戶農家，透過各種農耕方式、交易買賣、增加人手，來讓自己的農場五穀豐收、六畜興旺。每一個環節都讓你體會到當農夫的辛苦(這就有點誇張)。

美術:1
有個人風格的美術我覺得才是最好的美術，一些只依實物的繪製卡片，反倒會讓遊戲失去風格而流至平庸。農家樂就是一款又強烈個人美術風格的桌遊，讓我非常欣賞。另外各式各樣的動物米寶，讓遊戲配件更增CP值；此外風趣又幽默的卡片內容，配合卡牌能力文字描述，常常讓人發出會心一笑。

規則:1
再也找不到此絲絲相扣的遊戲規則，雖然步驟繁多，但規則只要教過一遍，配合遊戲過程，我的桌遊咖都能馬上融入遊戲中，比較麻煩的地方，大概就是職業卡及設備卡的選取，但職業卡及設備卡的加入，正是讓遊戲規則更完美的地方，讓遊戲更加多元及耐玩。

設置:0.5
本項目是一些深度遊戲的痛楚，眾多的卡片及各式各樣米寶，外加圖版及小配件，都讓本遊戲要花一些時間完成前置作業，對於時間寶貴的人來說有點小麻煩，但有愛玩久了，一切都不是問題。

路線:1
路線超多元，這也是一款成功遊戲必備的條件，此外配合眾多的卡片，都能讓本遊戲每一局都能玩出不同的策略。

互動:1
本遊戲互動超強烈，正是標準的你卡我我卡你的遊戲，每一個步驟都考驗上下家的決定，可以說是從玩家的第一步計算到最後一步，常常第一步的後續效果，都在影響著全部玩家，就是像是"蝴蝶效應"一樣，遊戲的最終結果，端看大家的第一步決定，這個遊戲讓玩家間的互動激盪出很多火花，表現真的太棒了!
 
個人:1
這款遊戲不管是多人玩還是一個人玩，都有著很多的樂趣，我個人非常喜歡。

朋友:0.9
玩過的都深深著迷，不過有人覺得太複雜，有點難以適應。

想玩:1
遊戲變化度十足，讓人欲罷不能，只是桌遊咖要有一點實力(對現在決策影響未來成果的敏銳度)，這樣玩起來才會感受到互相牽制卡位的痛苦感。

收藏:1
十大必收遊戲之一

總分:9.4
講評:擴充多，單人至多人遊戲都有不同的樂趣及玩法，本遊戲我單人玩的次數超過多人玩的次數，因為咖不好湊。在挑戰單人遊戲過程中，看著自己每場的分數持續衝高，真的很有成就感，也挑戰自己運用職業卡及次要發展卡的決策力，是訓練邏輯思考，未來決策的好遊戲。

The game did not capture me in any moment... I felt that I was doing choices rather than playing (or having fun). I know lots of people who like this game, so I'm guessing it's a problem of what kind of game I like, and not the game being bad in itself. Therefore the 3 for a game that I do not intend to play ever again.

Great, great game.  You never feel like you have enough turns to get everything you need, and the tension that can build up is amazing.  Probably the best designed game I've ever played, although not necessarily the most fun.  I highly recommend upgrading your copy with some veggie/resource/animeeples!

I also own the Gamers' Deck expansion.

UPDATE: Unfortunately, it looks like Agricola has been fired from my collection by Caverna.  The tension I love in Agricola is largely absent from Caverna, which is a big plus for my wife and other members of my game group.

A fantastic game with so much to do but never enough time in which to do it.  It supports different routes to victory and the various card decks and versions of the game make this pretty much infinitely replayable.  I still have not figured out the route to regular victory, but always enjoy the journey, and that is what proper gaming is all about for me.  Put simply, this redefined my idea of what a board game is.

RATING: 3
Sure, the card drafting is the main attraction of the game: you'll never play the same setup twice. But forcing the winning path of "doing a bit of everything" is one of the laziest self-balancing measures I've ever seen in a eurogame. You've found a great niche? It's irrelevant because of highly diminishing returns. Something sucks? Get some anyway or your score will suffer. On top of that, Agricola's neurotic approach to strategical freedom jumps right into the pitfall breeding of new workers as the obvious best move, giving the fortunate player who does it first an edge that's hard to catch up with.

Scoring is a headache, only happens at the very end and often needs a calculator, which means that at any point of the game it takes a ridiculous amount of time to determine who's ahead and what one should do. The micromanagement of fences and fiddliness of animal/vegetal reproduction don't really help with lowering the amount of mental entry barriers to what so many people who aren't me seem to find a lot of fun.

And that's before I start what I think of worker placement as the central mechanic of a game.

I saw this game last year in Essen, and decided not to buy it because it was very heavy, I couldn't try it out because completely crowded at the stand, and I preferred the English version (I do speak German but my friends do not).

This rating reflects play with the "drafting," variant. Drafting both Occupation and Minor Improvement cards removes some of the more capricious randomness and limits complaining by players as well as adding an extra twenty minutes of fun to the game! Would not play without drafting unless with a table full of new players.

You never seem to have enough time or resources to do everything you want to do.  Even during games where everything falls into place, it always feels as if things are going horribly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's the best game I've ever played, I think. A truly impeccable design, and it's surprisingly easy to teach for how much depth it has. I normally play the "family game" variant, but don't be fooled by the name. It's a tough challenge for anyone to make sure they can feed their family while scoring as many points as possible.

The best part is how many options are available to you each turn. It's one of those games that make you feel like you just never have enough time to do what you want to do. And I love games like that.

Also gets bonus points for scaling really well with different numbers of players and it can even be played solo (!). I would recommend this for any group, even non-gamers, as long as they enjoy a challenge.

This game will especially appeal to those who like the idea of building a little farm that produces things, but though it's more detailed than Puerto Rico, it's more complicated and less simplistically "elegant" (lots of arbitrary rules, exceptions, compared to Puerto Rico and Le Havre). Not a good introductory game. Can take a while to figure out if none of the players know the rules, even if players are semi-hardcore gamers. There is a simplified "family" rules variation though which does significantly simplify the game.

"[COLOR=#003300]Agricola is more like a grueling obstacle course [...] The end-game scoring conditions make every game feel much the same. It's a matter of getting a stone house "just in time." One of every animal "just in time." Covering your last empty fields "just in time"[/color]." [JohnRayJr]

"[COLOR=#003300]Feels a bit too much like an optimization puzzle rather than a game and way too long.[/color]" [mkgray]

Due to the scoring, one can't push to far out one system to the exclusion of others forcing a balanced growth in many areas. A game that will take a few plays to wrap one's head around as the choices from the cards aren't always obvious without having a feel for the full arc of the game.[/color]"  [RPardoe]

RATING: 7
Had it not been for the overdriven hype machine, I probably wouldn't feel the need to rip on a game I've rated an 8. The replayability provided by the card decks is a huge plus and how this game scales with # of players is amazing. But while there are some great episodes of decision making here, I get that same feeling from Stone Age (which is shorter, less prone to AP, and involves rolling dice from a leather cup. :P). I like this game a lot, but it's not the be-all-end-all of boardgaming it was made out to be, and I can't see this ever reaching my top 10.

UPDATE: Too many other games (worker placement or otherwise) are becoming more interesting for me than this one for the time needed. So much so that I don't know if I'll ever even suggest playing this one again. Rating down a point and traded away.

Fantastic game.  Very complex, and player vs. player is limited (no slash and burn mechanics, etc.).  Contains a huge assortment of cards allowing for lots of different variations.  Game 'changes' with different numbers of players, so no matter who is playing there is always a fresh experience.

A Euro!  I kinda want to know what all the fuss is about though...

UPDATE - really struggling to get over the tedious theme, but the gameplay is tight, and brilliantly executed.  I rather see this as feeding into the creativity of games that followed (like Dominion) more than being a fantastic game in itself, though the pieces, cards, and content is pretty flawless.  I'm just not a massive fan of medieval farming...

UPDATE - 20/12/16: This was and still is in my top 20.  Somebody explain why!  I'm not supposed to like medieval farming unless it involved goblins and broadswords...  :D

An extremely solid game. Every games will be different because of the various cards you draw, making the game one of the most replayable games ever. You can play the game both strategically and tactically, the rules are easy intrinsically, game play is smooth and scales well from 1 to 5 players. The only point to nitpick (a small one) is how it encourages you to diversify your farms for points scoring, and I prefer Le Havre for its wide range of creative scoring possibility, but nonetheless Agricola is more playable.

This farming game is right in my sweet spot and it is a solid version of raising a family on a farm starting in a wooden hut then going out and expanding from there.   

I've learned that the game is actually plenty good in the "family version" with no cards and food on the start player building up...plenty of game there and I will never teach the game to new players any other way as 14 cards overwhelm new players that are trying to learn the basics of the game and the "major improvements" get overlooked when you learn from the family game that they are central to the "engine" of the game, particularly food generation.....card play is too tempting to steer your entire game that way and score lower....only supplement basic game play with a few cards from the hand for the highest scores.  Only experience will give you any clue about which cards those might be...lowered this from a 10 to an 8 due to the launch of Caverna which is so much more fun.

Family members should only be worth 1 or 2 points each otherwise the game is nearly "broken"

I've only had this game for a few weeks and I simply cannot keep it in the box. This is pure addiction. I have no trouble getting friends and family to play it with me, and even when no one's around, I end up playing it solo. My only issue is that is takes a long time to set up / put away and it's a bit of a pain to restock all the resources every turn on the board.

UPDATE: I hate to join the bandwagon, but this game is the nectar of the gods. My friends and I can't get enough of it. It has moved to my only number 10, replacing A Game of Thrones as my current fav.

UPDATE: Hmm... back down to a 9. For some reason, it stopped feeling as replayable. Maybe I just need to let it simmer for a while, but the cards have stopped adding enough variety to keep it feeling truly fresh. Don't get me wrong, it's still awesome though. Oh, and another thing, almost everyone I try to teach this game cannot grasp the baking bread concept, and it's getting really frustrating to have to keep repeating myself.

UPDATE: I can't decide if I like Le Havre or Agricola better. Oh what the heck, they're both 10s. Uwe Rosenberg, you are a god.

There's something fundamentally not fun about Agricola, a game that seems to me to want to play itself and not be interfered with too much.

It's number 3 on the BGG all time list, but I really don't see why.  It's a relatively deep game, which is great but it's a pain to set up and keep up between turns.  It feels like you have accomplished little at the end, even if you have won.  Each time after playing I have thought, all that  for this?  I don't know how to improve it, but it's not perfect for me.  It's fun, it's ok, but it's not a favorite.

Update: I much prefer Agricola on the iPad. Bumping my score purely based on the game's mechanics.

Agricola's definitely got its strong points. However, worker placement doesn't excite me, and I very much dislike the scoring system, which rewards mediocrity. It takes so long to count up all of your points that by the end I no longer care who has the most.

Update: I don't mind the scoring system any more although it's still technically inelegant. Also people use scoring apps and just tell me my score which is way better.

In this worker placement game, with a theme based on farming, each player also has a unique set of cards. The scoring rewards being balanced, as you lose points for not having a particular animal or plant. 

What makes this game unique are the cards that you are dealt, and trying to form a strategy with what you have. There are a large number of cards, making for countless combinations. 

This is a very good game, and plays differently each time. 

It does get a bit long with 5 players, and probably a disadvantage for the person going last, so I would avoid it with 5 players. It's best with 3 or 4 players. 

I had never been motivated to play a solitaire board game of any kind before, but the solitaire version of this game is quite good.

Buen juego, de planeacion y estrategia, de pensar en estrategias!, y cuadrar cómo vas a seguir creciendo tu granja!, Lo jugue en version familiar y les encantó!, Ademas que los AnimalMeeples ayudan a darle mayor tematica al juego.

I prefer Feast for Odin most days but the more limiting nature of Agricola is still quite compelling. A common criticism of this game is that you are forced to do everything but that is key to the keeping the game competitive and interesting. Unlike most games where each player specializes and we simply see who can do their thing best, Agricola forces players to be competing for the same action spaces throughout.

I thought this game was coming together for me, however playing against others I quickly realised just how brutal the game is.  There are actions that each player [i]needs[/i] to perform when they come up, and if you miss out then you're fighting to catch up.  Such aggression is not my play style, especially in what otherwise appears to be a straightforward (if tightly constrained) game.
Not my cuppa.

A really good game. What holds me back from giving this game a rating of 8 or 9 is that it seems a little inelegant. While I enjoy the complexity, the game seems to lie in something of a liminal space-- it lacks the strategy of an abstract or wargame, but does not have the thematic unification of mechanics that many Eurogames have.

RATING: 6.5
I relatively enjoy the game. I like the theme of farming and growing your family and how that comes through in the gameplay. It makes sense, most of the actions. I am not crazy about the cards - its half because I'm kind of bad with them and half because when I played with my friends, it took a bit longer than I liked. I think 14 is just too much for me to mentally wrap my mind around, and I've only gotten off a good combo about one or twice in 10 ish full game plays. I've played the Family Variant a lot too with friends and enjoyed it though (my friends aren't really hardcore gamers and it was still a bit difficult to track, so I avoided using the full game). The FV is cookie cutter, but I still liked building up my farm, even if it didn't have as much variety as the cards.

Some minor improvements I would've liked are: vegimeeples (it only had animeeples), carved pieces to differentiate the stone and clay and wood and such, an effective storage for the decks, altenative scorings (everyone's farms always look samey and some difference would've been nice - perhaps a variant with scoring the same as Caverna's?), and first time preset hands like Season's has (there's currently a variant on the Agricola forums with this).

Full review where I wrote quite at length about this:

Oh and I dislike how much reading there is in the game. I am reminded of tcgs with cards with long effects and text, and I feel it is usually inelegant and not fun to be reading that many. At least in something like Dominion, its just ten you go over and arent usually a paragraph of abilities

Unlike other Rosenberg's games, there is nothing interesting about cardplay in this game. The only way that I see this is from Rosenberg is some of the tiles depict his own games. Look at his other beautiful games like Bohnanza, Mamma Mia, Klunker and Babel (and space beans?). They all had some very inovative rules on cards. This game just has mega-sized deck with special powers. Very disappointing to see that Rosenberg got his design depends on special power texts.Ugly-cola!!

Also the rule is very unclean and way too many data. I need my excel sheet to keep track on what is what. The game has very little player interaction too. It is not a bad game but certainly doesn't deserve the #1 place in BGG. (I think #200 is about right for this)

I have only played a half game of this so far with 5 players so I can't completely comment on this game. I enjoyed the farming and worker placement. I am not sure about the card mechanic even though I was spending a number of turns "tanking" to setup a bunch of powerful cards in my game that would set me up for the rest of the game. I still need to play a full game to get a complete feel for how the game ramps up. Next time I would like to have more time to study the rules and play.

Well, well, well, what to say...This is the kind of game I would like to dislike: Over-hyped, loads of bits, pieces and cards and totally f*cked-up theme -I was half-dreading a game about Mikael Agricloa, pushing the player into the role of a boring theologian with a mission to put together a written language with as many phonetically incongruent bits as possible- turns out its about raising wild boars and making babies in the German schwartzwalds. But then you press "play" and it's pretty damn awesome a game. 

How good exactly is too early to determine, but it is probably an improvement over both Caylus and Puerto Rico, the two games of which it borrows its main genes (Caylus; varied strategies, worker placement; Puerto Rico; role selection, depth and reasonable playing time). But the question becomes is it better a game? Agricola feels a bit like the 5th generation Ford Mustang; faster, stronger, slicker, more clever than its predecessor - but is it REALLY better? Only time will tell, my rating could fall to an 8 or rise to a 10. But for now I'll just enjoy the awesome ride given by a game of Agricola. Definitely this is the best game experience of 2008 for me insofar. Update: Yes, it's a great game, the King of Worker Placement Games - and better than aforementioned Caylus and Puerto Rico. 

Update: The K and I decks makes the game both better and more fiddly, so I'll push the rating up to 9,5 - just short of a 10. But the game is extremely engrossing, and I'm always thinking what I should have done differently afterwards, which for me is a sign of a great game.

Very hard to leave a comment here given all the hype, but I guess I can say it's currently a 9 for me - always wanting to play it. A worker-placement, resource management game with really tough choices. The main complexity lies in the occupation/improvement cards and how you use them, which can put off some casual gamers, but it's nowhere near impossible to manage. The solitaire game works well too, which is a big plus. In fact, so far I've played more solitaire games than multi-player....

One can play an entire game, lose dismally in points, and yet rejoice because your family never went hungry once.

I belive the hype! Agricola is one of my Topfavorite Games! I've Played it so many times, I can't count it. Good gameplay with 2,3,4 and 5 players. Every gamer on BGG should know this strategy game. What I like most is the assortment of cards. Whith this bulk of cards every game is different. It is like a very good inclusive expansion. BGG # 1 (08.2008-2010) deserved!  

Pro:
+ Good 2 player Game, its also good from 3-5
+ Bulg of carts = bulg of fun1
+ Women like it
+ A fresh new theme
+ Cool componetns (in the "pimp" Edition)
+ It't pressure all the time! The 2-3 Houres don't feel like 2-3 houres


Contra
- No interaktion
- In my non-gamer groups it was to heavy (I don't know why...)
- Geeks often don't like the theme
- long scheduling time (no problem, if you are organiste it well)

A different version of Caylus where you play against the game mechanics to build a farm and gather resources
You will find you want to do many things but there are only 14 rounds in the game

Tensions run high just before harvest "I NEED FOOD!"

RATING: 8
A highly addictive mix of limited action placement and an almost collectible card game method of customisation, if occasionally tilted in favour of the player with the best cards, assuming all players are otherwise equal. It seems easy to get into despite the reliance on making sure you approach it with right eye for what actions are needed and when, and the variety in the cards that are drawn each game mean that I doubt I will get tired of either the multi-player or the solo games any time soon.

The theme is also curiously appealing, and adds to the gentle and accessable feel of a game that would otherwise appear quite cutthroat, which has put me off some similar titles. Maybe it's because I've been recruited to help down at my local allotments from time to time, but it makes a nice change from angry space colonists and anti-social mages!

All a bit ludicrous. I can see how the supply of clay might be limited, but why on earth can only one of these farming families decide to plow a field at the same time?

I just can't understand why so many people love this game. Now, I understand why certain people think this is the next great thing, but there are so many others that absolutely love it that normally hate games like this that it boggles my mind. Let's see... it's a long game, taking some 2 to 3 hours depending on the speed and number of players. It's a complicated game with an enormous decision tree every turn that is further expanded by the cards. It's very fiddly. It's slow moving (i.e. the engine you are building takes a long time to get going unless you get lucky...). It's heavily influenced by the luck of the cards - some draws work very well together and others are near-useless. And finally, the theme should be a problem (farm work? Yuch) but for whatever reason, it draws people in. Baffling.

I have enjoyed this thus far.  It scales very well from 1 to 5 players, and is the only game I've played solo that I've actually enjoyed, although I'm not sure I've enjoyed it enough to justify the setup time.

I like the competition for resources.  I like the cards and how they impact the game (I've only used the E deck).  I like watching my farm grow and succeed (or wallow in mediocrity).

I don't know why it took me so long to play and own this game,but even after my first session I understood why this one is a classic and a must have for all boardgamers.
Very simple ruleset and endless combos with minor and major occupations.
Every time we play it we are trying to farm our asses off to get a personal best score.
This game is complete and does indeed stand the test of time.
Another positive is that each play doesn't last long so most of the times you will be up for another one,or get you warmed up for a heavier more demanding game.

RATING: 8
[b]Length: 4/5[/b]: AP players will probably push this game to a slightly longer length than some would like, but the game does a pretty successful job of maintaining game length because there are 14 and only 14 rounds in the game. Again, this can be lengthy with AP players, especially in higher player counts, but because there are base actions, and then additional actions are added once every round, the analysis paralysis is limited.

[b]Strategy: 4/5[/b]: The different improvements and occupations allow players to strategize around what they have from the very beginning of the game. You have to determine when a good time to bring additional family members will be, you have to determine how big to make pastures because bigger pastures will allow larger amounts of the same animal. You have to determine what resources to grab, because if you grab wood you'll be able to build additional rooms and fences, but you'll potentially be giving up the opportunity to get clay to upgrade buildings, or food for the harvest season, or sheep to place in your pastures. 

The first player marker is not passed back and forth between rounds, it's actually an action, which is really important because there will probably be constant fighting over it.

The issue with the strategy, is that this scoring for everything does have a cap, so you can't go crazy and collect a bunch of sheep or a bunch of veggies and ignore all else. Basically, everyone will be playing a similar game. Maybe one person will upgrade buildings early, but the other players will probably be doing that eventually. Admittedly, this actually showcases something nice, in that whoever wins did the job the best at the game, as opposed to other games where one path just gives more victory points for arbitrary reasons.

[b]Theme: 4/5[/b]: The theme isn't original. Farming. Riveting. 

Though I think this game does a good job of representing a family of medieval farmers. Often times, it's difficult to make ends meet. There's a lot you want to do and you can rarely do everything you want in a given turn. You are constantly doing actions that contribute to your family being fed as opposed to things that would otherwise give you victory points. I think it's interesting that the game motivates you to work in this way.

Also, on your personal board, you are legitimately building the fences and rooms that make up your estate. You are getting animals that have babies, plowing and sowing fields. It really does look and feel like a farm that you've built from the ground up.

[b]Longevity: 5/5[/b]: I don't think it can be argued that this game has a lot of replay value. You will constantly see fans of this game mention playing this game hundreds of times. This is because the game maintains the same actions, but the come out at different periods. This allows you to conjure up strategies that will work in future plays, but since the actions pop up at different times you can't necessarily be certain of the exact order you'll be able to do them in.

The replay value is also helped by the improvement and occupation cards, of which each player will get a total of 14, but there are so many of these cards in the base game, and then constant expansion decks being created (some even by fans), that you'll constantly be seeing new combinations and ways to play.

[b]Scoring: 2/5[/b] As mentioned above this is the only thing I really don't like. Caps on specific animals make it so that focusing on one thing isn't smart, and that the end game is pretty much always people taking one of each of things they didn't focus on in the game, or upgrading their buildings, or filling the rest of their unused fields. It's often times pretty samey, and turn order really matters in these situations almost more than anything else, because if 3 players in a four player game need a vegetable to avoid the negative point, it's likely one of them won't get it because everybody will be scrounging for it at the same time. Is that really a problem?... Eh... hard to say.

Someone posted a good point that if, instead of being a -1 point for not doing anything in a specific category, not having anything netted you 0 points, and then getting the lowest requirement netted you 2 points instead of 1, people would be a bit happier with that. Because negative points have negative connotations, but 0 points are basically just neutral, which makes sense when you're not doing anything in those categories. But, that cap is still annoying. You can achieve the cap somewhat easily if you kinda focus on it, and you are given very little incentive to go above and beyond.

Played, liked it but the game forces you in directions. Do this or get punished. Do that or lose points. Not my favorite but a solid game.

RATING: 8
After all the hype, I played... and I liked it, but I was not enthusiastic... then I played again, then I played again, then... I am hooked... What a beautiful game! You can adopt a strategy and see how your strategy develop... and each time new ideas, for new strategies... Also, thinking of the strategy, often it is easier to think more on the things you can do as a farmer (e.g. maybe I should cultivate more before acquiring sheep) and not in terms of points... Very very very recommended (in spite of the hype). 

UPDATE March 2013
I still consider it a wonderful game, but I moved down the rating to 9 because I like more "Ora et labora" that gives a similar experience, but which I like more.

UPDATE October 2015
Rating lowered to 8. I prefer Fields of Arle, and also Ora et Labora and Caverna. This should be reflected in my ratings.

One play, and I have some concerns.  I worry that a lot of the high praise may be purely from the experience of wrestling with a very unwieldy system.  What will be left once that system has been tamed?  Further, there is some concern that the cards you are dealt can seal your fate before the game even begins - though that will bother some more than others (I'm the latter).  This one clearly needs more plays before a firm rating can be established.  You simply can't get a handle on Agricola after just one game.

--update--
Two further plays with a fresh perspective and Agricola has redeemed itself in my eyes.  In many ways I actually like the Sim-Farm aspect of the game more than resolving the actual competitive outcome.  Agricola gets bonus points for reeling my wife in as well.

---update---
Agricola rocks my socks off.  It is the only game that has a solo-mode, official or variant, that I actually find engaging.  So good!

My first game into the new world of designer's board games. Because of that, I'll probably keep it forever as a fond memento. In any case, I expect never to play it again. Why? Simply because the game feels too tight for what it offers. Everybody battles for the same strategy - as there's no other - and, in the end, every game tires me too much while never offering new perspectives or experiences. An ok game, though.

Edit: And I sold it. :D

Early plays yet, but am fascinated that every game seems harder, not easier.  Lots to see here.  A little longer than I'd like, but not too much downtime between turns, so entertaining.

Now played a fair bit more.  Game still a challenge every time out, and not used anything but the E deck.  Drafting the starting hands makes lucky draws seem to go away.  Rewards both tactical and strategic play, and the ability to see the consequences of your actions several turns ahead.

This is a great game that I love at two players. It is stressful in a good way.

After multiple plays though I'm getting concerned about the games all feeling the same to me so this rating may change in the future.

*Update*

After finally playing this with the occupation and minor improvement cards multiple times I'm no longer concerned about the lack of variation from game to game.

This game is fantastic. I don't always feel like playing it since it's so stressful but I love it when I do.

My wife and I love playing this game, although she beats me nearly every time.  And she makes sure everyone we teach it to knows it.  Lots of replayability for us - we haven't even cracked open the I or K decks yet.  Probably because we've been teaching it to so many friends.

For the longest time I ignored this game until I watched a video review with a lengthy explanation of how everything worked.  I was hooked.

Very, very good and fun game.  Great for players who like to set up their game plan turns ahead. So many choices, so few turns to bring them to fruition.

This is a harsh game for first-timers indeed.

UPDATE (2/18/14)
Unfortunately, this game takes too long to be regularly included in my sporadic gaming sessions.  Also, the unfriendliness to new players means that the beginning draft is not played to its best.

Considering playtime, harshness, aesthetics and a draft that includes a minuscule amount of available cards, I think I'm better off enjoying other games in my collection.

Still, I recognize its gaming value, and if you have time to devote to this beast, then you should at the very least play it to find out what the hell all the hype is (was?) about.

This is probably my favourite game.  It's a challenge to decide how to best use your workers, there's a good level of competition between players for the resources, and the theme works well and is very cute.

It doesn't quite deserve a rating of ten as there are a few things that might be better.  One is that the initial allocation of occupation and improvement cards can perhaps make too much of a difference to the game -- sometimes you'll get a good combination that suggest an obvious strategy, other times you'll get  mixed bag that's harder to work with.  Also I'd think that an improvement might be to have the whole turn order vary, not just the starting player; this is because you can be at a disadvantage if the player to your immediate right is playing a similar strategy to yourself.  Finally it's a fairly expensive game and I think that it should come with animeeples and vegimeeples as standard instead of putting them in an expensive expansion.  They make the game much more fun.

But these are minor quibbles.  It's a great game.

There I was thinking, at last, a game that'll allow me to subdue the tribes of britain and extend the Pax Romana to the furthest reaches of the empire. Even better it's a block game, but having played it I have doubts about its historical veracity. There is no feeling of being Agricola and we have the whole die Fugger problem of everyone 'being' Agricola. The final straw came when it became clear that the blocks really weren't big enough for any sort of stickers. Rated during BGG.CON III.

edit: Ok. I've removed my 1 rating and I'm sorry if I have offended anyone and I encorage anyone still with a one rating to remove it (same with retaliatiory 10's).

Agricola is worker placement game of limited choices.  Each player has two family members with which to choose a task.  That task is then blocked from other players.  Each player must make the best choices possible to help build their farm and feed their family, producing grain, vegetables, and livestock.  There are a large number of options to choose from on each turn, but with only two choices to make, it can be difficult to find the right path to a good score.  Many times I've felt that I was futilely selecting a bad option among many terrible options.  However, I always find myself thinking about the game long after we are finished.  This, to me, tells me it was a *great* game.  I highly recommend Agricola!

Bland wooden pieces, text-heavy cards, too many boards and components, restrictive negative victory point conditions, and uninteresting worker placement options. Limited workers make rounds end quickly and progress slow. Dull.

Agricola is a worker placement game where you are a farmer with a family which you use to take actions.  3 family members, you get 3 actions, however you must feed the family every harvest as well.

The scoring system is very interesting because there are various groups where you will score in and depending on how many, sheep lets say, you have, you get points for that.  0 sheep = -1 point, 4 sheep = 2 points for example.

Once starting this game the world ceases to matter while you strive to get everything you want to get done.  This game really sucks you in, after you look at the time and say, wow, that was two hours?  Bought the game within a week of playing it for the first time and can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 10
I've only played a couple of times, so these are newbie impressions. For a game that only lasts 14 rounds, it packs a punch. I'm sure it gets easier over time but there was more brainhurt here than in Ora & Labora. It mires even fast players in AP. Yet it's so much fun -- so many ways to go, different decisions to make -- it feels like there is so much you can do (even though you don't end up doing even half of it), and then very abruptly, the game's over.
----
My newbie impressions have held up :-)
The almost infinite number of permutations of starting cards, which really guide one's strategy, means it'll be a while before replayability is a problem. There is a balance problem in that an unfortunate set of starting cards can seal your fate, but it's still fun to explore the possibilities even if a win is out of reach. AP is exacerbated in this game, so try to play with fast players.

Agricola is pretty easy to learn. The strategy, however, was at first pretty overwhelming. The occupation and minor improvement cards give you so many potential decisions. Once I got the hang of it, though, the strategy became super fun. There are some interesting combinations and synergies with the occupation/minor improvement cards and I like having so many options per turn. The rules are really elegant and the game just works super well; I can't really find any flaws. Some people hate the fact that gathering the food to feed your family each harvest gets in the way of developing your farm, but I love how tightly you have to play in regards to this. If you play too greedily and develop your farm to the exclusion of coming up with a food production engine, you'll get DESTROYED when harvest comes and you'll have to take beggar tokens. The game really encourages diversification by design. Overall, I highly recommend to anyone looking for a board game with a ton of depth and replay value.

It's good to have a lot of stuff to do and to care about, but Agricola isn't that intuitive and seams just a bit mess as the game goes on.

pros: theme, scoring system, some good tension, variety,

cons: anal. paral., the sheer number of different cards make you keep looking at your cards - would require so many plays to learn the cards it is simply not worth the effort, - it also makes it difficult to concentrate on what others are doing, random card combos' unbalancing effect; pick of starting player action by other players can have a strong impact on the outcome.

overall, the advanced game is a little too long for what it is and for the luck factor the card draw brings (a 5p game took almost 4 hours, with 4 it is more managable, can click under 3). I am surprised by the high ratings, I like balanced games and prefer the family version.

RATING: 9
This is a really smooth economic engine and reminds me of Puerto Rico (PR).  However, having played PR a few times, I believe that A[gricola] is and will be the better game for me.  The reason?  Theme.  In PR, there is a certain abstract nature to the play.  In A, you're building a farm, from start to finish.  In PR, one has to hope for 4 things to happen in the correct order just to get money to buy a building that you think will help you in 3 more turns.  In A, I find myself busy with survival at the moment - if I need clay, I move that way.  Of course, I expect to be confounded (and do some of my own :-) in a multiplayer game.

I used the SoloPlay rules and highly recommend them for solitaire play.

Why this is not a 10:

A clever design, no doubt, but I'm just not that fond of worker placement. More player interaction would be nice too.

Also, what's up with the negative points in scoring? Is it just to make you feel properly chastised for not having acquired any cows? Increasing all scores by one would be cleaner and more elegant. (Well, you'd have to give 1 VP per fenced area instead of increasing the score per enclosure to keep it exactly equivalent, but that'd be a small price to pay to get rid of the minuses.)

One of the classic worker-placement games. I find the food requirement too strict; it is hard to actually do anything, and once you can, you are hamstrung by the scoring system which incentivises diversification.

I do enjoy the combo goodness of the cards, which the family game misses out on. In general though I prefer Le Havre.

RATING: 7
Somewhat complicated. The different improvements make the game difficult until you've learned how they work together. You need to know what paths you have before you, but it looks like a good starting position can be play a fairly major role.

After playing a few times, I realize that depending on the number of players, different approaches are needed. With five, wood is much harder to come by, plus with more players, baking bread is stronger, but not as available. With fewer, you have the chance of building up your infrastructure much more quickly.

Although it feels that the game is dependent on the initial card draw, I don't think it is that much of a hindrance. It really comes down to taking advantage of your cards, and paying attention to how your opponents are playing. Like Puerto Rico, you don't necessarily always want to take the 'optimum' option, since you might prefer to throw a monkey wrench into the other players plans.

-> Sometimes, an innocent worker placement of one of your rivals can ruin your entire throughly planned strategy.
-> The scoring mechanism, even if fair, is far from elegant.

Otherwise, it's a great worker placement game, probably superseded by Caverna.

Very long set up time, but the game is fun and I love the theme.

RATING: 10
I've played several family and "advanced" games. Even a basic family game version feels very good and as such is a great game. The cards add more AP to the game and especially the start of the game goes slowly as everyone is checking their cards. But I like to play with them as then you must react to the cards and adapt your play. It's also much more fun with cards!

Theme fits mechanics very well and I like how there are many small subgoals (get food to your family, building enclosure to animals, breeding, etc.) that keep you busy while playing. Actually the scoring feels almost unnecessary in the end as playing itself is so fun. There seems to be a enough freedom in strategies and chances for being creative with your moves even thought scoring forces you to keep everything rather balanced. Simply an awesome game.

Update (13.7.2008): After another game (this time Z-man english edition) I decided to increase my rating from 8 to 9. And this is only after playing second "family game".

Update (17.8.2008): After few games with cards (basic and complex decks) Agricola really feels a superb game. The cards add variety and you must adapt your play a bit depending on what combos you'll be able to do. Cards don't change too much the gameplay but give just the right amount of more to think about. The game is simply more fun with the cards. They actually do add element of luck into the game but this shouldn't affect games too often and in any case it isn't a negative thing to me.

Update (3.9.2008): Ten games and game just seems to get better and better each time. I'll rise my rating for Agricola to a full 10 as it is very fun to play but a brain burner at the same time and simply very, very good game. When played with cards it gives me the same feeling as playing a CCG games. There is no deck building but there is thinking the playing order of cards and combos the cards can give. I didn't realize I was missing it and now playing Agricola (along with Jambo) fills this small niche for me as I don't usually play CCG's at all. This is probably the reason why I'm rating the game so high.

Update (23.9.2009): There is definitely luck involved in how occupation / minor improvement cards are distributed. Tried yesterday with drafting and although that probably is one of the best alternatives it is quite taxing to read 3-5 times 14 cards and more so to try to remember what good combos you might be giving to others... To me good things in drafting aren't big enough to really use it.

Smooth in its mechanics, lovely theme, complex  in its possibilities, not in its rules. This is one of the 2 canonical references (Caylus being the other one) I look at to compare and evaluate strategic-economical kind of games. I´m relatively new at the boardgaming community and this was one of my first adquisitions, after trying other games I am realy happy to have started with this splendid work of art :D.

An overwrought, over gone, scripted mess of a game that takes the ideas and complexity of Caylus and multiplies them into the n-th dimension. What is the hype about? The greatest game ever? Hardly. I suppose it is novel, but once the novelty wears off all that one is left is pretty packaging and a game that is mostly devoid of fun.

NOTE: This game is better with all the cards, and can be worthwhile now and then. But the game's bookkeeping is maddening.

I've played Agricola a handful of times, with different numbers of players.  I enjoy this game as well.

I will likely continue to play this game for a long time - it's a keeper!

RATING: 9
Yet another efficiency exercise, and although its not the best or most elegant game in it's field, this one does it with some charm.  This game's major boon, apart from the pretty components, is the cards. The wealth of options that come from the plethora of cards gives players a sense of exploring the game and I expect will keep the game fresh over a fair number of plays. The cards also provide chrome that is usually only present in bigger, dare I say it "Ameritrash" titles and there is definitely a sense that you're building up a farm. It's not as free flowing as I would like from a game and it certainly lacks interaction - though shouts of multiplayer solitaire are perhaps a step too far. Extra interaction would be nice, certainly nothing as crass as burning each others crops and livestock, but perhaps a trading mechanism. This game is better with animeeples.

RATING: 8
So far I'm still enjoying this game :)  The occupation and improvement cards you receive at the start of the game do seem to guide your play a little too much, though.  I get my opening "hand", I think about it for a while, and I know what my plan will be (or at least what two or three possible plans are, depending on what other players do.)  I think in future we will play with the take 10 keep 7, or draft variants for these cards.  Mixing decks seems interesting as well, although the "Z" cards are too off-the-wall for me.

RATING: 9
Complex worker placement game where the most valuable farm needs to be built over 14 rounds, including houses as firm as possible, cattle, cereal, veg, and other assets. Each of these items means one more layer in the game (there are different aspects to sowing, farming, building huts or fences and feeding), which involves a little bit of spatial reasoning (how to build the farm), the separate management of all the aforementioned resources plus cooking utilities, timing not just for choosing actions but to sow the right amount at the right time, and of course clever hand management.

As ambitious as it is, Agricola offers some discussion points: 
(a) The actions in a turn are not carried out for example in straight-and-then-reverse order like in Die Siedler, and picking the starting action means losing costly choices... so the player just behind gets a relative benefit when many players are on the table. Still, even though there are more refined ways to "bid for first player" (Caylus comes to mind), spending an action to gain the first move in the following round grants an extra improvement as well so it can be a useful tactical weapon.
(b) The card sets dealt to the players at the start are random so that some "synergetic combination" may occasionally bias a player, and it can't be balanced by more interaction than blocking other player's choice of actions. Nevertheless this is perfectly possible (blocking a resource, for instance), and managing the player's hand incorporates a strategic element absent from most games driven by worker placement.
(c) The games are quite tightly scripted, all phases containing similar events. This might look at first to stiffen the play, but as it happens with the previous issue, it turns out to favour the development of strategies rather than tactical manoeuvring.

Agricola might be so varied thanks to the huge amount of material rather than due a truly refined system, but the bottom line is that it shines with its love to detail and that in the end the game is insanely replayable anyway. A deserved classic.

RATING: 9.6
Un capolavoro. La versione avanzata è molto dipendente dalla lingua per via delle carte; la comprensione dei benefit delle carte è fondamentale. La parte iniziale del gioco: distribuzione carte (fortuna) e pausa di lettura per valutare eventuali combo e strategie (tempi morti) sono gli unici difetti del gioco. Agricola offre tante strategie; l'obiettivo è quello di far fruttare il proprio appezzamento di terreno, si può scegliere di ingrandire la propria casa e famiglia, allevare del bestiame o coltivare la terra. A fine partita conteranno solo i punti vittoria quindi potrebbe aver senso specilizzarsi, ma attenzione, rimanere a zero in qualche settore porterà dei punti negativi. Come se non bastasse durante le varie fasi di gioco bisognerà essere in grado di sfamare i membri della propria famiglia per non avere penalizzazioni carestia. Insomma un gioco complesso, dove ognuno sceglierà la propria strada ma l'interazione potrebbe costringere a cambi di programma. Spesso a fine partita si ha la sensazione di non esser riusciti a far tutto ciò che ci si era prefissati.

RATING: 10
Yup...just about worthy of all the hype. A fascinating strategy set and flawless integration between theme and mechanics. Insane variety of cards designed to appeal to the CCGers. Possibly one of the best games for long-term strategy: if you find yourself with an action to spare, you know you haven't played it right.

There's a lot to be said for 'going back to basics' and playing the Family Game a few times every now and then. The purists might sneer, but - by God - it doesn't half focus your attention. I defy anyone with fewer than one hundred plays to drop the cards from time to time and see what an intense, tight game it makes.

Further Thoughts - some of the occupations are starting to become slightly old-hat and seeing a pet card appear in front of an opponent is very demoralising. Plus it's frustrating when you get dealt a hand full of mediocre improvements which you can't justify using. And as for the game-end scoring? Sheesh! Talk about overblown.

Further, Further Thoughts - at the risk of this game getting Boydelled to death, it really does make for a good dynamic evening in without too much brainburn. Contemplating a personal Top 10 re-entry...

Further, Further, Extra Thoughts: 300 games down the line and a continuing enthusiasm to play more doesn't justify leaving this at a 9.5 rating. Up we go!

Wow. I never thought I'd see a better Euro-game than Caylus, and then along comes Agricola! It's got Caylus worker-placement fun, only now you have to house AND feed the the workers you have. No more slave wages of 1 denier. Ingenious. And the cards make it a new game everytime you play. "What card is that?!"

Encountering new and powerful combinations of cards and getting into play means this game continues to be fresh every time.

I've finally put my finger on what this game reminds me of: Stone Age (should have been more obvious to me, I know). It definitely has a more artificial feeling of tightness than SA though (longer focus needs to be placed on securing food, for example). Resource conversion, feeding people, family growth, worker placement are all present... the one thing this game has that SA doesn't is the (contrived) sense of creativity the personal player board offers. It's a well made game, overall. I'm just unimpressed with it personally.

I've played 3/4 of a game (family version) with my wife, and i dont think she wants to do another 2 player game anytime soon... we had a good time but she got frustrated at learning the rules (half attention over a 3 hour period)... i may get to play this more often, but i think it will take both my wife and i playing this in our new gaming group and liking it there


besides my lack of playing i think this has the makings to be an absolutley kick ass game, and it can be even more instense with the different decks being involved... I wouldn't be surprised to see this game get a huge jump in the ratings

I'd very much like to play a 3-4 player game next

Very good game. Cards give a lot of variaty, which is missing in Puerto Rico and which is not so strong in Caylus. However, they also introduce luck and the horrible "Agricola effect": when players are more than 3, you completely lose track of which cards they have played and of what they are currently doing, therefore playing basically on your own.
Moreover, experienced players overkill opponents who do not know the exact value of every card in the initial draft.

Agricola manages to be far too short, but also way too long at the same time. I always end the game feeling as though I have left things unfinished. It tends to be a game of regrets, frustrations, and envy. 

That being said, Agricola is also a good bit of fun. It is visually great, especially with hand-made clay replacements for all the game pieces. It is rewarding to grow a little farm throughout the game, fun to have pastures full of animals and such. The amazing variety of cards even in the base game keeps it feeling different every playthrough. It is a game that I will never tire of playing.

I rather like this game and would like to play it more to fathom the depths of it but NO ONE in my family of gamers likes it. It is very fiddly and has way too many cards for its own good and it is after all a worker placement game--not my favorite and it plays too long for what it is. I would prefer a whole lot of titles to this one (including Le Havre) and would still rate it a 7 but from the family's reaction I deduct a point.

RATING: 3.8
Non-plused and underwhelmed.  I just didn't care for this one.  It takes too long to develop and seems like a bunch of people playing solitaire from the same deck.  Not enough interaction for me.  A lot depends on the cards that are dealt to players so its not always an even game.  I'll play this if the group *really* wants to but would rather spend my time doing other things.

Have played more times and my rating has gone from an initial 6 to a 4.  This just takes too long to play for what it is.  If you could start with 3 family members and play in say 8 rounds instead of 15 this might be better.  

I've logged a few more plays and I like it even less.  I don't want to give this a 3 so I reduced it to 3.8.  I understand the game play but its just not enjoyable.

Amazing game, great mechanics, incredibly well designed and a "must" have for all euro games fans. Only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because as in the expert mode the occupation cards are drawn randomly, a player can get shitty cards while another gets really good ones. This cards are very balanced, overall, but some combinations of them are too overpowered, like for example getting those that give you food for every time you get wood and then extra points for building things with that wood, so you keep stacking all the wood in the game, and as anyone else has wood, you get most of the animals too and bla bla, and that is almost certain victory for experienced players. It's my only criticism and is really rare, but it can happen. Still recommend it 100% though.

2016: My favorite game of all time. Perfect as it is. Punishing and satisfying. I've never had so many arguments with my wife over anything else. So good. 

EDIT: 2018. After having owned about 200 games and played even more, it is still the best game I've ever played, and we still play it! Pure genius. It is mind boggling that, for instance, Scythe is rated higher - while being an OK game, it is nowhere near as good or thought out as Agricola. Terraforming Mars does not deserve to be in the top 10, either, it's super boring.  Heck, Viticulture is almost there and it's still a luck fest after the expansion. I don't know why someone would settle for less, in my opinion, no game has dethroned Agricola yet.

RATING: 4
Really really not my game. 

It took me a while to understand why. It's the lack of direct interaction for sure, at least partly - but that's not the main issue in my judgement: The THEME and its IMPLEMENTATION are the problem! It's as simple as that. 1.) Farming is lame and 2.) its implementation is thematically unsound.  

There certainly are games in which worker placement is a logical choice theme wise (like Alien Frontiers or maybe Manhattan Project or Dungeon Lords), but worker placement as the driving mechanic is totally unsuitable for that particular theme. It just doesn't make any sense! The idea behind worker placement is to exclude others from a specific scarce resource, right? Resources at those times, however, were practically NEVER limited to just one farmer in a villages, on the contrary. Everyone had access to wood, for example, because forests belonged to the community. Bread was made in a public baking house and so on... I mean, even TODAY, farmers still share equipment like harvesters. Also, family farming was a mandatory all round job. The farmer didn't just chose one action, he had to do all jobs over and over again... And finally: Why can't we trade!? The theme makes it the most obvious thematic option!

These objections may seem rediculous, yet they make me not enjoy the game. The whole game design is an underestimation of the value of a well presented theme. 

Special note: I sincerely appreciate this fully developped product. There are hundreds of cards, everything is so well tested, so clever and neat - now that's value for money! Take a closer look at this and shame on you, FFG et al.

[b]Agricola[/b] was received in a trade (7/17/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Agricola has become one of my all time favorite games (it is in my top 10). It is a game that I have come to appreciate much more as I have continued to play it, in fact I enjoyed my initial plays of Le Havre more than Agricola. However; the more I played Agricola the more I came to appreciate how tense the game is, I love the beginning of each game when you look at your cards and have to try and make a long term plan. At this point Agricola and Glass Road are my favorite Uwe games (I just layed my first game of Arle and I'm not sure what to think yet).

At this point I know that my kids likes/dislikes are not a good indication for other kids, but they love Agricola (my son is 12, my daughter is 10) so I always have willing opponents to play with so Agricola will continue to hit the table in my house. We also just got Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, I can't wait to play with the expansion and see how it changes the game play. I'm glad that it seems like growing your family quickly isn't necessarily going to be quite as necessary with the expansion.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):[/COLOR]

[i]- I really enjoy balancing the feeding of your people with managing the rest of your farm.
- Theme: I really enjoy building a farm and seeing how everything looks at the end of the game. 
- Beautiful artwork and amazing bits (if you upgrade them, which I did directly through Lookout Games).
- Card play: They can really push you to try a different strategy in the game, since they give you a small advantage in one part of the game.
- High replay value: There are a lot of cards and different decks of cards to explore in this game.

I finally got to play this when Joel brought it to the meet up, and I definitely like it better than Caverna. 
The main reason is that I really like the card play over the buildings, much more variability. Second I really did not like the adventuring system in Caverna.[/i]

With farmers of the moor I feel this is a near perfect game. The only knock I have with this design is turn order is clockwise of the 1st player. With higher player counts you can get locked out of a key action space simply because the wrong person took 1st player before you could.

RATING: 4.5
Only played 2-player and solo:

The gameplay is good and challenging. I can definitely see why the game is popular. It just doesn't make me want to play it again. The biggest factor is the amount of upkeep on the main player board is needed every round. Plus the setup and tear-down time compared to how long the game actually is at one and two players. You will spend just as much time moving components to and from the box as you will playing the actual game.

While there are certainly ways around these problems. The game just didn't do it for me.

If I got it to the table with more players these things probably wouldn't be such an issue as the game would be longer.

Compared to Dungeon Petz, which is more fiddly and has more bookkeeping. But is also longer, and has more humor and theme. Agricola just didn't make me want to play it again.

I can see why this game is rated so high, but in the top 10? It is a very nice design and with so many opportunities & options while playing. The theme comes through nicely for me as well.

I think, however, that I would never play this game with more than 3 players.

My copy includes the "Agricola Pimping Resource Meeples". 27 wheat, 27 brick, 18 stone, 18 veg, 33 wood, 15 reed.

One of my favorite games.  I really enjoy the decision making in the game.  Also, the flavor and theme really come through. 

Rating slightly lowered because I prefer Caverna. Also it bothers me a bit that you are encouraged to do a little bit of everything as opposed to being able to specialize.  However the tension in this game is fantastic.

Uncomparable depth. A game that takes your dreams after a long night trying to grow some cattle while your wife should get pragnant (for the thrid time) and all the hungry mouths needs to be feeded. Due to loads of differnt cards each time a new experience. Love it.

Edit: Initial rating was a 9 in Feb 2011. Now after more than two years I only rate it a 7. Don´t know, it is still a game I would always play if someone would suggest. But there are loads of games out there (and in my shelf) which I prefer more. So I would probably always bring something else on the table...

Just an excellent game.  Fun theme and plays great with 2 and better with more. After a lot more games (and many, many more to come) the sweet spot is 4-5 players.

RATING: 7.15
This is one very interesting game! The huge variety of card choices possible in this game, make it strategically re playable. It is intense and you cannot afford to make a mistake. In the end game point scoring I always regret any tiny mistake I made in wasting a turn earlier in the game! The need to keep variety in your farm and your choices of occupation and improvement cards really make every game unique!

So far, in 2 and 5 player games we are seeing a struggle for the wood resource, but in 4-player games there seems to be more of a wood freedom. This isn't a flaw in the game...just creates an interesting intensity of game play, with different numbers of players!

The solitaire game is really enjoyable! You play a series of 8 games, keeping one occupation from each of your games! You start each game with no food and you must feed your family 3 food per turn! Also there is a goal score which you are trying to beat...and if you beat it you may start each subsequent game with some food based on your score! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
 A fantastic game, with lots of possible strategy and tactics. It has enough interaction through action choices to make it not too solitarish, but there are enough choices that you are seldom placed in an untenable position by the other players. The sheer amount of options seems to offer great replayability.

A two-player learning game, and a 3-player all learning game five years later. 

I can see some of the appeal and how different cards will affect your strategy, but it right now seems TOO restricting.  It's not interesting tension between good actions, but rather boring artificial restrictions that prevent you from building much of anything.  It really ramps up the last few turns, so maybe it's just designed to have a slow curve leading to a manic finish.  But that little bit of excitement doesn't really satisfy right now.  I'm willing to try it a couple more times and see if it improves through familiarity.  

I usually like "boring" themes, so I have no problem with that aspect.

One of my favorite games, though it's rare that I ever win. It's one of those games where I'll frequently utter, 'I hate this game,' while playing, which, of course, means that I love the hard decisions that it forces and difficult positions it puts players in. Though the cards really make the game, by giving players new twists to go after each game, almost without fail, I chase those cards too far.

I have played this a few times now with different people... still haven't won but have fun each time.

The theme is really well observed, I do have some extra wooden pieces for the game rather than just the cubes that came with it (carrot shapes, corn shapes, etc) which help.

The cards being split up to different decks really help customise the game to who is playing.

At some point I'd like to game with some of the expansions.

I play this when I have the chance, but it takes a while to setup and play through.

After 2 plays, I really enjoy this game.  It's straightforward, and not having enough time to do everything you want makes up for the lack of direct interaction with other players (other than them taking the space you wanted, you don't do much with them) so it's pretty tense as the game progresses. I'll withhold an actual rating until I get more plays under my belt.

We mostly play family-version, and it doesn't have quite the same "I want to do everything but I don't have time to do anything" feel as the full version, but is still great.

I prefer Le Havre's possibilities of focusing into just few things and still getting great scores.

I can't love this one like it's rating would indicate I should.  In fact I SO don't love it after three plays that I traded it away.  And this was after I had been so pumped at the idea of buying it (it IS #1 after all) that I began pimping it out before I ever played it; got the animeeples, downloaded and printed (and stuck on) the resource stickers; the whole nine yards.  And then it just sucked as a game.

Lame theme and boring goals.  I find the whole "harvests come every few turns in the beginning but then without reason come every couple and then every one turn at the end" mechanic contrived and inelegant.  Definitely does NOT deserve to be in the #1 spot by any stretch of the imagination.

The theme carries through very well, making the rules much easier to understand than they would normally be for a game this complex. Most of the complexity is depth thanks to the conversions and all the choices from the cards. The family game wouldn't be that much easier to understand, but would be easier to figure out a strategy.

As a vegetarian, I am disappointed that it's far easier to figure out a meat-eating strategy. In my second game I came in 2nd with a fish-only strategy. Meat is SO much easier, because you can't bake on demand, AND there is only ONE "bake bread" action anywhere.

The BGG weight of 3.6 seems a bit high to me...I'll go 3.2. Still heavy, and I wouldn't want to throw even the family game at casual gamers, but better than I expected.

Somehow I managed to avoid all penalties on my first game ever, winning with 34. Wow. Second game, each player only had a penalty in one category. I came in 2nd with 30.

Excellent game. Still has the edge for me as the occupations and minor improvements really change the game, each play. Really satisfying building a farm.

ワーカープレイスメント + リソースマネジメント

箱庭作る感覚でのんびりプレイしてる分には楽しい
大量の特殊効果カードを僅かずつ使うことで毎回の展開に変化が起きるよう誘導している。

排他的なワーカープレイスメントなのでインタラクションは良くも悪くも強い。

勝ちに行くなら自分がやりたいことばっかするというより人の邪魔をする必要があり、のんびり感がなくなって箱庭ゲームとは違う感じになる。

After playing it again with a new group (full table of 5) I was amazed at just how visually confusing this game is! The big cards representing the different actions players can do are so bright and colorful and there are so many of the... WOW! It's still an awesome game but there's so much visual noise there! It clearly lacks the simplicity and elegance I so much enjoy in Caylus.

Still love the game though! Great mechanics (though not original) and the possibility to adapt it to any configuration of players! Family, advanced, with cards, no cards, different decks for different playing styles, etc! Very complete!

- The rules are well written, a bit of a small font, but well structured. Players used to play heavy euro games will have no problem in understanding these, but the game will have to be played two or three times before players can grasp its full potential.

First game bought on hype. Big mistake. The playdoh rush on this should have told me something. I can't think of another game that turned me off from playing it even once, but this game's dense, confusing, and bland rulebook, ridiculous '...meat eating habits we continue to this day' intro (shame on you Uwe Rosenberg for not adding 'bad' in front of habits and insinuating this is a game focused on meat farming.), and reviews of 'solitaire' sure don't make we want to slog through learning it or teaching it to others. The endless rules questions on BGG is another warning sign. Do you really want to bother with figuring out 360 cards and their combos? Sorry, but I had enough of that crap with MTG. Lesson learned: ignore hype and 'appreciating' a game just because it knocked another sucky game like Puerto Rico out of the number one spot. I've began to realize the majority of the entire top ten on this site is a joke and doesn't belong there. 

This is one case of too many cards. Really ads AP downtime to the game, as everyone struggles to find out what their cards mean and how they interact with each other. By the final third of the game, there are at least 25 actions you can choose from! Seriously, this is deranged. I understand that this game will take ten plays to become clearer, but I doubt most people will have the patience to reach that number. 7 hours for our first 3 player game, with ONE person in AP mode. This puts Agricola in the same category as 'Advanced civ' as far as game length, and 5 plus hours is not going to get this on the table very often, especially not when this is a clear homage to 'Caylus', a much more elegant game that does not rely on luck of card draws.

Mostly solo games so far but I'm really happy with it, the solo option is a real plus - I can't remember any game I've played so frequently after opening. The multi player version brings a different tempo and challenge to the game and overall it scratches a nice itch. Rich in theme, looks to be almost endlessly replayable especially multi player.

09/08 Upping the rating, I like this game, a lot and am keen to play it. As an added bonus it's one of the games Agnieszka will request - a solid 10

06/09 This game continues to draw us in with many plays. What's amazing is that no matter how much we play the game seems to always reach rounds 8 and beyond quicker than we expect - cries of "already?" and "I have so much to do" are usual

My first introduction to worker placement threw me into the deep end, to say the least. It was quite an early addition to my collection and while it didn't see the table for several years it is now back in the rotation and is played on a regular basis.
I love how this game allows you to tweak your engine using your hand of cards but restricts you from the overwhelming choice presented in some of Uwe's more recent designs (Caverna and Fields of Arle specifically). The much maligned "necessity to feed" is key to my enjoyment of the game and gives you direction and tension.
I want to update it to the new, revamped and rebalanced edition but am finding it hard to justify the expense.

Ideal worker placement game. You always feel like you were one or two steps away from playing well, even if you win. The timing and pace of the game really makes it work, because you always feel like you have three more things you need to do but you only have the time for one, and then the game ends.

As opposed to Le Havre, where options open up as the game progresses, I prefer the "shutting down" of options in Agricola. As the turns progress and players get mroe and more family members, I like the fact that options in the end of each round are limited.

The expansion, "Farmers of the Moor", is pretty much a requirement, however. I haven't played the base game in a long time.

It's sort of amazing how tense, fun, frustrating, and wonderful this game is. When things come together, assuming they do, it feels so marvelous. So many last rounds find multiple players suddenly raking up points by solidifying their farms, which is a remarkable part of this game. With many viable strategies and the influx of multiple card combinations, you can feel like you're having somewhat of a new experience with each successive game yet still feel like it's enough of the familiar experience to make you feel truly at home with the family farmers serving as your proxy in this strange, occupation-filled world.

RATING: 10
This is a great game and one that my wife and I really enjoy so far. Every mechanic and the overall frantic feeling of not being able to quite do everything, really matches up well with the overall theme of being a farmer in the Middle Ages. It can be very challenging and can sometimes beat you down but when you find the right combinations of occupations and minor improvements, it is a thing of beauty.

I tried and tried to love Agricola 'cause everyone else seems to, but I just can't make it happen.  I should play it more often, but it is a very unforgiving game in which one or two poor moves early can doom a player to defeat.  It is of course possible to learn to avoid these, but this is only possible through repeated plays.  Learning the strengths and weaknesses of the myriad cards is essential as well, and this also takes practice.  I admire Agricola and it excites me in theory, but in practice, it takes too much effort to get to the point of enjoyment for me.

3/18/12 - This game is so random, I am surprised so many euro fans like it. I never get anything helpful in the occupations or minor improvements. I like randomness but it just doesn't fit in this game. I really need to stop playing this game.

9/17/11 - I finally got to sit down and play Agricola. My teacher was Ken and he had a nice set with some custom pieces. We flew through this two player game as the decisions got tougher. I did feel behind most of the game but for my first time through the game, my goal was to manage my empty spaces. I ended up with 20 points and lost to a more seasoned player. 

With these style of games, the multiple options always overwhelm me in my initial play. I am sure once the familiarity of cards and choices become more second hand, I would probably do better. My rating may change if I play more but for now its a 6.

RATING: 8
I'm not crazy about an excess of components to be constantly tracked and refreshed and corralled loosely on the table. And cross mingling between player boards and central play area just doesn't usually excite me.  Also, games with a large footprint on table I'm just not a fan of.

Despite this, I like it and it has grown on me.

Pluses- I like how everything kind of comes together and how you never have enough time or actions to get what you want.

Nov 08-Played solo (42). I missed the rule of less wood and feeding more(solo rule)-that would make it tighter. Need to remember this

June3 09 - Solo (48). Remembered feeding more, but forgot less wood rule. I'll get it right someday!

June4 09 - Solo (61) Maid, Forester & Fence Overseer. Got wood & feeding rules right.

10/2012- Update-the girlfriend like it! A decent length journey down the gaming highway for her, I have taken her from Stone Age, to Lord of Waterdeep and now to Agricola. And after her first play, she wanted to go again right away! 

Also, this seems to be a go-to solitaire game for me. These two factors have kicked it up to a 8.5 & a solid keeper.

A game where you get frustrated and spend most of the time fire-fighting and hoping to get somewhere. I really do need to play this game more and try and focus on certain areas. Work out where to score points and be happy to lose points in other areas. It's certainly the best and most difficult game and worthy number 1 on BGG (though I haven't play Puerto Rico - shock-horror!)

+ total scalability: scales great without changing feeling and strategy depending on number of players
+ complex but still very logical rules: no need for looking at the rulebook every game for some small easy forgettable rule like bunch of other euro complex games
+ thematic for euro game: you are really building farm from nothing with all joys and frustrations (and more frustrations) that go with it
+ high re playability because of cards
+ and of course fun
- it can be frustrating at times trying to make all the stuff you need to do on your farm (like surviving)

Warum ich diesem Spiel eine 10 gebe?!

Agricola gehört zu den Spielen für die man mich jederzeit begeistern kann. Bei jedem Spieleabend, bei dem es vorgeschlagen wurde, hatte ich auch Lust es mitzuspielen.

Ich mag die jedesmal unterschiedliche Verteilung der Ausbildungen und kleinen Anschaffungen, da somit jedes Spiel etwas anders verläuft.
Sicher sind einige Karten von großem Vorteil, aber ich brauche keine gleichen Ausgangschancen. Ich freue mich um so mehr, wenn ich trotz mäßiger Karten gewinne.

Was mir besonders gefällt, ist die Atmosphäre des Spiels.
Man ist hier wirklich ein ökonomisch arbeitender Landwirt. Meine besten Ergebnisse erziele ich, wenn mein Bauernhof Tiere, Getreide und Gemüse produziert.
Das Thema Bauernhof kann ich im Spielverlauf spüren.

Deshalb ist für mich Agricola eine 10.

RATING: 10
Bought this at Essen without testing it, just because of the Fairplay scouts! 
1. Gaming time: This game has no hidden information so it is destined to become the worst game for players with analisis paralisis (Playing solo took me not 30 minutes but 2 hours this might become better with additional gameplay)
2. Interaction: Very limited. You can "steal" actions, but somehow it feels that it just makes no sense to see what the others do, as everybody has to check his own farm. This changes in the last round. (see point 3)
3. Turn order: Just the last two rounds it can become extremely frustrating to get actions taking that are crucial to its own farm. So having build for 12 round well enough can be undone by another player. (this seems to be contradictory to point 2)
4. Solo gaming: It may become redundant as the actions to do are very similar, even if different cards. Still it is great, that the designer has thought about it.
5. It may be too peacefull for warmongering gaminggroups, but a fun game for wives and girlfriends.

So, even though I have listed various nitpicking points, the game is still very good and fun to play. I will have to play it more often before the vote is going to rise or fall.
Update: Raised my vote to 9!
Update: After one year and playing it over 40 times I can seriously say. This is a 10 for me.

So many things to do and a lot of paths to victory. The options are endless and the game is very nice looking. After a few plays it seems that you are playing alone and blocking happens only by accident since it is too costly to waste an action as a block. A good game for sure, but not as fun as I had hoped. I would also say that it is best at 2 or 3 (but even at three I hesitate to play), due to the lag between plays and the over thinking needed once you hit 4 players, which really makes the game lag. But with the right group, it can be great.

RATING: 8
I spent way too much time umming and arring about picking up Agricola, mainly because I thought that the theme wouldn't appeal to my group. How wrong I was! It is an amazing game that I keep coming back to (It is my most played game and I've almost played it twice as many times as my second most played). The cards really make the game and are often the deciding factor in who wins. By that I mean the person who utilised their cards the best. To mitigate a bad starting hand I always deal 10 and discard down to 7. I've played this the most two player with my wife and she loves the game. Our two player games take about an hour, which is great for a game of this weight. Adding players does increase the play time and I think it is usually around 30 mins per player.

Since the game can be so punishing, it has been really fun to see our scores get progressively better the more we play. In our first few games we were winning with scores around 20, now 20 is a really poor score and you need to be in the 40s to guarantee a win. Once in a while one of us hits 50 something, which just seemed impossible when we first started playing.

I also like the fact that the base game comes with three decks, which adds longevity to an already deep game. After 30 or so plays we've started to add the complex deck into the easy deck to mix things up a little.

If you like Euros at all, you've got to try this one.

RATING: 5
In my opinion, Agricola did not dethrone Caylus as the king of worker placement games.  Caylus is a much more elegant game, though Agricola is more thematic.  Caylus is also much more interactive.  The set up and constant restocking of the supply spaces in Agricola is fiddly to the extreme and detracts from any enjoyment of the game. A mere two actions per round for about half the game seems more of a frustration than a challenge. I respect the design, but I just do not look forward to playing it.

I have played this 5 or so times. I want to like it, and I don't know why, but I just can't. The constant pressure of not being able to do everything you want, or even need to, is just not quite for me I guess. I get enough stress at work, When I play this game, I just heave a sigh of relief when the game is done thinking, "man.. it's finally over..."
I am hoping to play Caverna, which I have heard is a couple degrees chiller, to see if that is more enjoyable for me.
Despite how stressful the game is, the pieces are great and the rules are solid. If you like a high pressure game where you can just never feel like you're getting ahead, definitely check it out.

Great Components, so many Cards its pretty impossible to ever play two games that are the same, a game that lets you make hard decisions based on the fact, that you never have enough recources, labour or open spaces to do what would be "perfect".

I really don't know what to say about this game, I've enjoyed playing this, but every time with a diminishing amount of enjoyment.

I think the problem is that as it's a very popular game some people have understandably played the game many times, and when you get involved in a game with one of those, your chances of playing the game succesfully are greatly diminished. I know this can be said of a lot of games, but I think because this is the No. 1 game, that situation is heightened with Agricola.

Having said all the above I still enjoyed playing the game. I might buy it one day and just play it with my wife, maybe that will be better as we'll both be at the same level.

I like this game a lot.  I like worker placement games and non-destructive games.  I also enjoy a little less player interaction than some so this is about right to me.  I don't get to bring this one to the table too often though because it's a bit difficult to teach to new gamers.  I normally will teach Lords of Waterdeep first and if they enjoy that I'll jump into this one.  I'm not a fan of the family game and agree that you have to draft the starting cards. Playing with five is sheer madness.

An excellent game that is always just a little bit different. The hype is well deserved. However, I am not sure it has infinite "replayability", despite all the cards, as only a select few are really useful.  That said one must be flexible with one's strategy. Definitely not for AP prone people.

RATING: 6
First play on 8/20/08, 3-player "family" game, plus 3-player "occupation/minor improvement deck" game. I was thrilled after the first game, and immediate felt the influence of Princes of Florence, Caylus, and Puerto Rico, as well as a little Age of Empires. Had the same desire for replay as I did after my first game of AoE, with no negatives like I felt with Caylus (length, dry). Playing my second game with the first deck was quite as impressive as I hoped, it made the game somewhat more "solitaire" than it felt in the family version, as each of us chose our own path and I can only remember one move in the entire game that one player could dramatically affect another (and he ended up choosing a different space anyway). But I rate the game an "8" immediately, and suspect it could climb to a "10" and take out Puerto Rico (or at least tie it) for me. 12-25-08, played again - 5player, and 2player. Raising rating to 8.5. June, 2013: 5 years later, Agricola has kept my interest, perhaps to a large degree due to new cards released frequently. The expansion doesnt seem necessary, and no one I play with seems to have much interest in it with all the different decks available. The game sometimes feels same-y to me, so I dont see this ever becoming a 10. Still, one of my top 5 desert island games. [iOS app has given me opportunity to play many more games in 2013. After about 25 using the E-deck, I've raised this game to a "10", but only if card-drafting rules are used.] About every third game I've played without drafting, I either get totally hosed by the card draw, or my opponent gets a killer combination. While it is theoretically possible to slow down an opponent with great cards, it requires a level of play that is beyond my capability, even with probably close to 100  games under my belt (including solitaire, which I do not log). I have not enjoyed playing multiplayer when hamstrung with a lack of card combinations or synergy, and the game drops to a "5" without 10-3 or complete drafting. Some might find it entertaining to "build a farm" while their opponents outscore them by 50%, but I would rather play a more interactive title if I know that a random draw could make any hope of competing impossible for me. As a solitaire game, I rate this a 10 for about the first 30 games with the base decks, as the combo problem is eliminated over multiple games. It's lower for me now, but stays a 10 overall due to the impact this game has had on me, my friends, the quality of components, and the value it has provided for the investment in time and money.

9-23-16: I'm rating this personally, using BGG rating criteria. Moving to an 8. My number one opponent moved away, and I've just not been inclined to teach this to new people now. Moving to shorter playing titles also.

Playing Agricola is like going to your favorite store with very little money. Accept that going in and enjoy the competition. First play was with cards against experienced players, and found that the cards gave me something to focus on.
When teaching this, it's important to know your audience.

[color=red]Soloable Game[/color]
Playtime: 45-120 minutes

Comment: This game has gone on such a swing for me. It used to be a favorite, but that is waning just simply because it's so hard to get to the table. I absolutely adore this game. The only thing that really knocks it down a peg or two is the setup as well as the copious amounts of reading of occupation/improvement cards. If you play it like it should be played (with drafting), you're spending an extra 10-15 minutes reading and figuring out strategies.

[b]Update:[/b] Still unsure of how I feel about this game. I finally got it to the table recently and I had forgotten how mean/tight this game is. I still enjoy it and I feel like you have a lot more tense decisions than Caverna, but the Minor Improvements/Occupations partially kill this game for me. While a major bump to keeping this game interesting and fresh, it's a lot of work to plot out your cards and actually read them. Yes, with repeat plays it becomes easier, but it's such a hurdle.

I will say however that the game is excellent solo. A few years ago I was not fond of playing to beat the highest score, but that style of game has grown on me. You can learn and play with the different cards and see how they interact with each other.

Played it after a friend bought it for being 1#. I can't remember anything about the game it's completely forgettable. I think it's 1# because the breed of gamers that more heavilly populate and interact with the website enjoy this style of game. Personally I like to have a bit of light hearted fun or something complex with an engaging concept. This was neither of those things.

The one, the only.  Perfect balance with enough randomization and choices to ensure that you play every game differently.

This game has stood the test of time with my group, propelling itself to the to the top of our board game stack.  The consensus is that this is the best German-style board game we've played, and possibly our favorite game in the collection.

I don't know what else I can say about Agricola.  Do yourself a favor and give this game a try.

TRY Aug/08: fine resource management game, with wide variety of things to try.  I like the interaction with other players via round selections of tasks, and some of the card abilities.  Played with 3; I'd like to try with other numbers.

OWN Sept/08.  No animeeples :-(, but Z-man deck :-)

TRY Sept/08: 4-player, family version.  If anything, this just cemented the rating as very high.  We had a great time, even though our scores all stank.

This one may be rated 8 or 10 in the future, but for the time being I rate this as 9.

March 2010: I'm not the biggest fan, but I admit this is a good game. I like the mechanics and there is enought theme, but still there is a tiny piece missing so that I can rate it higher. Maybe it feels too much like solitaire or maybe this feels too much like a mathematical exercise with laborious calculations.

Great game. Although the theme, farming in 17th century Germany, may not sound very exciting, it is very well expressed in the game; you really feel like it's a farm you're building. It is fun to see your farm grow, even if you're not winning. While the family game (without the cards) is also goos, the cards add a lot to the game, if you let them choose which one of the various paths to victory you'll to take.

Great game! It's like a mixture of a worker placement game like "Stone Age" with the farming part of "Harvest Moon". But because of the abundance of cards and possibilities it's much better than similar games. I've played "Agricola" with two, three and four players and it was always a great fun.

It's quite easy to learn the game mechanics. Beginners and younger players can also start with the simplified family version without the occupation and minor improvement cards.

Even the solo version of "Agricola" is interesting. Of course it's quite different from the multiplayer versions, because you can plan all of your actions till the game's end. But it's also an appealing task to get as many points as possible with cards you have.

Bought it based on the buzz, but when (1) my wife fell asleep during my constant-rule-checking of the first game, and (2) we had no clue what we were doing the 2nd game, I really thought I'd made a mistake.

Then, everything clicked in the 3rd game, and this is our favorite game by far.  It's totally engrossing, the 2P game goes by quite quickly now, and it's one of those games that we'll sit around for awhile afterwards talking about all the "If I'd have done/played/chosen this, it would have...", and there's very few games that do that to us.

The game got played like crazy during Christmas 2007, but after that it hasn't been played that much. July 2008 - got the english cards and animeeples, will hopely play more. It seems as if Stone Age has replaced this for us.

RATING: 7.5
I would probably like this game better if scoring did not have minus points for things you don´t have in the end - the game plays out quite similar each time thanks for that, only the way to get there varies. And I don´t like the luck aspect of the occupation and impovement cards - too high for such heavy-weight worker placement game. Theme is not that exciting either. All the negatives aside, still a good game to play sometimes.

edit: after some recent plays I am starting to like it a bit more and more. Rating from 7 -> 7.5

One of the top worker placement games.  This game provides many hard choices vs other worker placement games, as it's very difficult to do a lot of what you want to do.  The needs far outweigh your workers.

The job cards provide an extra layer of depth to the game, however aren't really needed.  I've played without with newer or younger players, and the game still plays very well and a lot quicker.

The neg is that this game is pricier and seems to take longer than it should, due to analysis paralysis.

Too long to set up, too long to break down, too many pieces, too many things to do, too much of everything. If this game was reimplimented as a video game, it would be 10 times better. Not having to manage replenishing, harvesting, setup, and breakdown would actually put this into the 'worth the time it takes to play' category.

Update: it has now been reimplemented into a video game (iPad) so I've gotten to dig a little deeper, and... It's about the same. I traded one set of problems for another. The sheer amount of table busyness and upkeep shrouded the fact that this game is almost exactly the same every time you play it. I see now why Rosenburg put in the ridiculous amount of occupations and minor improvements he did - to trick people into thinking they weren't mimicking themselves (and everyone else).

What a super strong game, it always leaves me wanting to play again.  Don't care what anyone says about Caverna...it's not as good as Agricola.

Just an absolute gem.

2/21/10: I actually like this game now more than when I first played it.  It can feel like you lack sufficient time to do everything you'd like, and that can frustrate some players. I, however, find that that's where a lot of the fun rests.  Some players can take a lot of time to make their moves, but this doesn't strike me as a game where you need to carefully ponder each move.  Of course, that's probably why I rarely win.

3/24/10: I changed my rating from an 8 to a 6.  I still like the game, but it's lost just a bit of its lustre.

7/31/2010: Changed rating to 9.  I'm on a big Agricola kick now.  It helped that I started playing against a really good opponent who is challenging me to play better.  I am appreciating more the variety that the cards offer.  I am still an average player, but I'm always itching to play more.

Build your farm in the most efficient way you can. Actions are very scarce so it's important to maximize their effects. Timing is very important. The tension to get food for your family is enough to always keep you on your feet and to distract you from your main goals. 

The cards twist things around just enough to make every game feeel very different.

I sense some potential!Somehow these games where you struggle between life and death with very low resources seem to manage well.

Game boards are beautiful (I like green) and there are fair number of choices in game. Many tough choices have to be made but some good ones are truly rewarded. After my first game (family game) I give 8, but I think I'll have to raise this very soon.

Update: After second game - 8->9. Next stop: Minor improvements...
Update2: Minor improvements were just great. Nice closed-info factor which provides you with uniqueness. Same thing as with Occupations. This game is just way way way much more than the awesome basic mechanics of the family game lures you to think!

This is my first non-traditional board game besides Risk. I've only ever played games like Monopoly or Scrabble, which I've only really liked for the companionship of playing with friends and family. Risk was my favorite board game up until I received Agricola as a gift. Now I think Agricola is my new favorite. 

My one wish, after a few games, is that it came with more occupation and minor improvement cards, because the version I have doesn't seem to have many. I like a lot of variety. Make that two wishes- I wish the pigs were pink because they look identical to the stone unless they're right in front of you. The stone could have been gray, too, because it looks more like coal or obsidian. But these are tiny complaints, and really I could just paint the pigs myself eventually.

I've played it two player so far, but it feels like the options on your turn are very limited. With 3 or 4 players, I think that would really intensify. I don't mind competition and it has taught me to try to have alternate plans ready. The shorter (1.5ish) game length is nice too. You won't stay up way too late trying to finish a 4 hour game. 

Besides some of the colors, the wooden pieces are awesome. The cards and board pieces are colorful and feel nice. 

This is a fun game that I plan to hold onto for a long time, because it's complex enough to be interesting, but not so complex that it turns people off. However, I will try to get some card expansions to keep things fresh.

Played only with family version, which by the way is plenty enough at least in the beginning when learning the game. There's a lot to do even without the extra cards. Then when adding the cards I can see that you get a lot of play time out of this game.
I liked this a lot. Gave me a headache with all the planning though (not necessarily a bad thing).
Tough game. It's not the small-talk kind of game. You sit there and plan your moves and calculate how to get together enough food all the time. Good game anyway. Better than Puerto Rico? No way. PR is more interactive with the role selections and the screwing with shipments.

Still only played without the cards. Might be that the game gets even better when adding those. Possibly a 9 rating then as well.

So far I love it - 6x2P and all played out differently thanks to the occupations/improvements and competition for key actions. Not many other games I've wanted to play back to back like this one (Manoeuvre and Pandemic both had this attraction), but only time will tell of its long-term appeal.

Update: Played or the first time tonight with my wife. My first impression was "what is all the hype about?". That lasted until about 2/3 of the way through our game. At about that time, things started to click and it got a lot better fast. I can't say that it is my favorite game, but it seems pretty solid. 

My wife liked it more than me I think, which says a lot. She is not nearly the geek that I am. 

I will certainly be playing more in the near future and I think that with time this game could earn an even higher rating from me.

I actually like this game better than Caverna unfortunately, because I paid a fortune for Caverna and for its storage solution!!

Makes for infinite replayability! This game doesn't come out enough!!

Our first Eurogame, purchased mainly because it was so popular, I can definitely say it lived up to the hype. It's definitely up there as one of my favorite games.

I really enjoy the worker placement mechanic and building the little farms. However, I hate converting my animal cubes to food, so my win-loss ratio suffers from all those begging cards!

Finally had a chance to play with four (rather than our traditional two person games) recently.... it really rocked. Much more challenging!

I don't think we've ever added cards again. I only really remember about it that it took way longer, and was boring to wait for people to read the cards.

Update:  This game still stands strong after many plays.  It adapts well to lighter gamers and heavier by changing the deck options, expansions or just playing the family game which is also excellent.

Old: This game is one of my favorites.  It's very challenging to try to get everything done.  My main complaint is that this game is difficult to learn from the obtuse booklet, and the bare colored pieces can be confusing.  Now that we have the pieces gussied up (including a divided tray to hold components and make set-up quicker), I really love this game.  With all of the deck options, I think this game has tremendous re-play value.

The game is deep and fiddly, yet my six year old can play it.  There's something intuitive about gathering resources to build things.  On the other hand very poor play is possible and the cards can be overwhelming.  If not for all the setup I'd play more.

RATING: 6
(1 play, lots with app)  I've only played this game once face to face, but played dozens of games on the app.  With a bunch of experienced players, I can see this being a good resource building cube pusher.  However, playing the app over and over again gave me the opportunity to see just how easy it is for new players (and not very attentive experienced players) to screw themselves early in this one.  It's just too unforgiving to get it on the table.  Needs a group that plays the same game(s) a LOT.  Not for me.

$33 ($30 Game +$3 Plano box)

I own this on IOS and so glad I did pick it up when it was on sale for $4. The app packs a long 90min game into a 15min experience and it is so much fun none the less. Of course I got my butt kicked by the AI because I was very inefficient with my actions but I will be better! I can see why people complain this game forces you to build everything and be jack of all trades in the game. There is no strategy sets like other games where you can go all out in live stock or crops. You have to do everything. This is where the worker placement mechanic comes in. You WILL want to block your opponent in this game.

RATING: 6
My God what a slog. You have to do everything so you can't focus on building a unique strategy, so games get very samey. By that I mean that you score for doing specific things like getting one of the several types of animals, and you are penalized for not doing specific things like not getting a specific type of animal. The penalties are so severe that you have to do a little of everything or you lose on penalty points. Hence - it doesn't seem like there are multiple ways to win.

Finally, JUST as you start to finally build an engine with some momentum, the game ends. Why on earth is this game so highly rated? 

A friend who loves this game convinced me to refrain from selling it until I'd played it half a dozen more times. He insists that once I figure out how to build an engine early, that the later game will become fun, and that it is common for new players to feel "mired" throughout the game because they never build a sufficient engine to get their heads above water. I'll take that on faith for now. Ultimate assessment pending more plays.

This is about as deep as I'm willing to go in terms of complex games. Three different building materials, upgradable buildings, fences, 3 different animals, 2 types of crops, more than a dozen cards per player of occupations and improvements - it's a lot to handle. The problem is that it's so critical that you know the game inside and out to be competitive, you need to own a copy if you intend to learn all of the game's nuances. The fact that there is so much to the game is as much of a selling point as it is a reason not to buy. A 4 player game runs at a 2 hour minimum, and there's perhaps even more of a seating arrangement luck factor in this than there is in Puerto Rico. Having newbies mixed with advanced players spikes the game a lot more than fans would admit, and new players can feel disenchanted after realizing that a mistake they made in the first 4 rounds will make such a huge difference by the end. I prefer games where you can actually recover from mistakes. 

That being said, it's a great brain-burner of a solitaire game, and that's generally what I've done most of since I've owned it. Due to its complexity, I think it has more longevity as a solo game than Pandemic.

One of the first games I played beyond Catan. Agricola is the essential backbreaking euro. Can you feed all of your people?...not really, but somehow you do it. I love how hard the choices are in this game and how well the player interaction works in accordance with that. I prefer this to the looser system of Caverna.

Have played countless times solitaire, which I enjoy quite a bit.  The game is (thankfully) quite different with more people, with different goals and challenges.  The abundance of cards will give it almost infinite legs, and I really enjoy playing against the system.  The player interaction is mostly limited to blocking roles, which is tense and ends up guiding several actions, but may not thrill a lot of folks seeking more confrontational types of conflict.

What can you say? It's Agricola. You either love it or you hate it. My favorite part of the first few plays was when my wife commented that "It's just like our farm! Everyday you have to pick one or two things to get done."

RATING: 9
They don't call this Misery Farm for nothing. But, I have so much fun being miserable. The game defines how worker placement should work, has amazing tactile progress as you build your farm and is agonizingly hard to figure out. The only knock I would give it is that it feels like it ends just as you are finally building something to be proud of.

I should like this game more than I do. I love worker-placement games but on this one I just feel like I'm floundering the whole game and never manage to pull a strategy together.

Why can't the occupations and Minor Improvements be better balanced? Just too much chaff, sometimes. Drafting really helps alleviate this. Additionally, some of the card expansions that have been released so far, as well as purging the overpowered and weak occupations, really tightens up the decks and adds massive replay-ability.

Otherwise a superb, extremely tight resource and action management game. I can't say much more that hasn't been said already.

best with farmers of the moor expansion.  Prefer occupations side over extra resources side because of increased variety.  we also culled the occupations and improvements from all the decks to make the game more balanced.  i love the severity and ruthlessness of this game, but that if you do well you can still score well.  

do not like the ipad version since it is only 2 players, no FotM, and all cards.

I really enjoy this game and can never decide if it's going too fast or not fast enough. Sadly, I always feel a sort of let down at the end because there's always a I-still-wanted-to.... factor. I feel like you can't complete the game - you just end it. I still like it and won't turn a game down, but I like to feel like I accomplished something in a game and this one doesn't do it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very German game: linear, few upsets, logical and very close scoring at end game. Adults can play it for the analysis required and kids for the theme. Very well designed and although it completely lacks adrenaline rushes. I heard that Agricola's instruction manual won an award - for the life of me, I will never understand why, I found it badly divided and horrible. Very static game with little variation other than 3 or two cards that are randomized each round and the choices of other players. Le Havre seems to be the exact same game except it has more variation with the availability of supplies and has a more Puerto Rico feel as to the different roads to victory. Warning: your first games will be very boring due to rule checking and not having a clue what you are doing and which combinations give you more points. Unless you are playing with gamers that want to learn and perfect themselves, don't waste a casual board game evening playing this with one timers who expect an immediate reward on their first play. Expensive game.

RATING: 9
Very little to say that many people have already reiterated. I really like this game because the rules and gameplay are rather simple, but the long term winning requires careful consideration. The game also puts me in a good similar level as the rest of my family, so I can play with them as really dangerous opponents. We gave thought to "prettying" the game up with custom wood pieces from Mayday, but decided to spend our money somewhere else, as we agreed this probably would not enhance the experience that much for us. Maybe if I get some extra money I would go for that, but I think we would be more likely to buy a expansion instead.

A lovely domestic farming game.  The animeeples and veggiemeeples are a wonderful touch, and unlike most worker-placement games, one is always bombarded by the sense that there are too many options.  One can't possibly do everything one wants, and the options only expand as the game continues.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very clever and enjoyable game that's obviously had a great deal of thought and work put into developing, testing and balancing it.  Over-hyped, unfortunately; yes, it's good - but does it quite deserve the enormous reputation that's build up around it?

The enormous number of permutations of occupation and improvement cards make for a very re-playable and varying game, but at the same time they're the Achilles heel of the game.  If a player receives a set of cards that integrate well he/she has a *massive* advantage compared to a player that has cards that don't support each other.  This seems more of a problem in 2-player games.  Various "drafting" options mitigate this somewhat, so finding out you like to use is important.

Although all that reads rather negatively, it's a very good game and one that I certainly enjoy.

not bad, but I like le havre better. I don't care if this one has more replay value than le havre due to the variability of the occupation cards. I guess I like turning raw materials into a finished product that can be used this way or that way better than how Agricola uses the goods.

More plays diminishes the ratings...  there's other worker placement games that outshine this (Mecanisburgo, Bus, Age of Empires III).... mostly because they don't make me feel like a turn is broken into 4 or 8 micro turns and it feels like you have opponents rather than a race to complete a puzzle.  

I need to plant trees, to get wood ten years from now, to build a sawmill, to cut more wood, to build a room on my house so I can raise more kids that will cut me more wood... but wait? I built a room when I needed food... damn, I need a stove or more fences, that way I can have more food for my yet to be conceived woodcutting kids... fuck it all to hell. I need wood to build fences and that new stove too... I have an empty room and no stove!!! OH SHIT, how will I make beef jerky!!! AAHHH WE ARE ALL GONNA STARVE!!! That's an exciting game right there. I was on the seat of my pants since that first turn when I did not get the reeds and clay that I wanted.  And why can't I burn my neighbors fences or steal their daughter?

My score for this goes up each time I play it but, it is not a game I would bring out often because of time commitments and teaching new players to play. My first game was a trip thru slow starvation as no one explained how to feed my family properly. I next played with David who helped me a great deal in getting the hang of it and I even won that time. I think maybe with the right expansion it would be abit more but, not sure.

Multiplayer solitaire with little interaction between players aside from blocking actions. I found this really boring and the English translation is stuffed full of errors.

After a second game, this time using the solo family rules so as not to be overwhelmed by the cards, I feel like I barely scratched the surface.  This first game with no coaching took a very long time because of all the thinking and referring to the rules.  However, I have to admit that I did not see the time pass.  This is a good sign.  I am looking forward to playing this one more.

The most overrated game of all time. Typical worker placement eurotrash game with an extremely boring and souless theme.

The mechanic is boring, Zero player interactions. We play boargames to have fun right ?! Who the hell wants to be a farmer anyways. Go play Harvest moon on your playstion or Farmville. It's thousand times better than this garbage.

The game dragged on for ages without any new or exciting things to do... Gosh it was so painful that nobody had fun in my group. Played a first time, it was so bad I almost cried for wasting my money on this game. Our group gave it a second try a few weeks later, but it was no better... in fact in was actual worst than the first experience. I want those 6 hours of my life back.

Received from my 2009 Secret Santa!  Having the game in hand now I am very excited to jump in. Looks like I won't be able to play until after Xmas, but I think that's just about right given who it was that sent it.

Wow. Just...wow. After only a handful of plays I'm going to rate this a 10 because I have rarely been so quickly enamored of any game I've played. The beautiful interplay of mechanics combined with a theme that actually feels integral to the entire experience make this one of the finest games I have ever played. I will revisit these comments after I've put in at least 10-20 games to see if my feelings have shifted with more plays.

Wow....

Update: 20 plays in now and the game is more compelling than ever. We've only scratched the surface, really, as we've only played yet with the E-Deck. It has become our family game of choice and we all can't get enough of it...it's games like this that make me wish I had more time for games.

A top-notch game of role selection.  There are never enough workers to do everything you want to do, and others are trying to block you from important actions.  A lot like Citadels with second-guessing of opponent's intentions while trying to still gain the best possible actions for yourself.  The sheer volume of cards available makes each game unique, forcing players to think on their feet (something I appreciate very much).  This game reminds me a lot of others such as Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence in that you have your own playing board, but all the action really occurs through the acquisition of things to put on your player board.  With the cards adjusting people's strategies each game, anticipation and calculated risks are important.

Basically another worker-placement & resource collection game, although it does have a number of features that in some ways increase the appeal above e.g. Caylus & Puerto Rico: the theme, the variety of cards, the way everything is tailored to the number of players.

The huge number of cards will certainly keep the game fresh, and whilst there are bound to be some unbalanced combinations, this unpredictability will make sure that your goals are slightly different in every game.

The game plays quite quickly, especially with fewer players. However, the last few rounds can bog down as there are increasingly important decisions to make.

Components are decent, although there are insufficient pieces supplied, esp. for 3+ players (doesn't seem to be an issue for 2 players) and the multiplier tokens are a pain to use.

WARNING: Could future editions have more/better pieces & corrected cards etc.?

One of the granddaddies of worker placement and still one of the best. Works brilliantly mechanically and very well thematically. Has been largely superseded, imo, by Caverna but I will always return to this when I'm in the mood for a tighter, less forgiving game.

Best Game Ever. You'd be wise to start your relationship with Agricola with less than 5 players to get more familiar with the basic mechanics. Also, I like the 'I' and 'K' decks more than the standard 'E' decks. Try the solo version!

Infinitely re-playable. I have over 30 plays and have only used the E deck. When cards get used, it provides a unique way to build your farm over others.

Many don't like the tension the game creates, that tension is what makes this game great. Since all the resources are scarce, you have to plan each round according to what you need and if you don't get it, you need to have the fall back plan.

RATING: 7.9
I'm going to go against the vast majority of fellow geeks here and give this game a more average rating.

Let me start by saying I like the base game of Agricola a lot.  It is extremely well designed and balanced and on its own would merit a 9 or a 10 score.  

However, the game loses score for me on 3 fronts:

1) Fiddly - Having to reload the actions after every round is just too fiddly for me.  I think Uwe has even acknowledged this with some design choices he's made in his latest game (Ora et Labora).

2) Fixed end game scoring - The end game set goals just seem a bit boring - I can't really put my finger on why.  Everything you do which can be quite wild and diverse (which is good) all have to converge to the same score card every time.  It's only a minor thing really and it's probably just me.

3) Overpowered card combinations - This is the biggest issue I have with the game.  The fact that there are now hundreds of Minor improvement and Occupation cards leads to a big problem - Overpowered combinations just ruin the original, beautiful mechanics of the underlying base game.  Some combinations can quickly and easily negate the need to do certain things or boost their productivity in some way.  This smashes the original balance and struggle you have with the base game and makes it too easy to build a powerhouse and win.  

So how do you overcome this?  Well, you could just deal out random cards.  That wouldn't work because 1 player may randomly receive a power combo.  Instead you could do an organised card drafting - but this is more likely to generate power combos.  Whilst being fare (since all players will benefit), they are ruining the underlying base mechanics and making the game to easy still.

Now don't get me wrong, to play a power combo or even see its potential does require skill and clever timing - but it is completely unfair to players who have not got one of these combos or are less experienced perhaps.

Este juego esta muy padre, a mi me encanto, esta en español por la editorial devir.

Me gusta este juego por que colocas granjeros ( yo compre meeples de madera para substituir las fichas redondas ) y los pones a hacer actividades, solamente que lo he jugado en version familiar.

Actualizacion:

Wow! Este juego en su version avanzada es un mundo de diferencia a la familiar, los oficios y las adquicisiones menores le dan un aire totalmente nuevo.

Act#2

Les aconsejó que consigan un organizador ya sea a medida ( yo lo conseguí en mercado libre) porque es una molestia la organización en cada bolsita ziploc, también me compre los vegimeeples, los resource meeples y los comida meeples, le da un toque muy bonito al juego.

Act#3

El mazo difícil es muy complicado de usar, lo odio.

Act#4: 

Si por alguna desgracia, desastre natural o que se yo, me obligasen a escojer solamente un juego, este sería mi elección, este juego es mi favorito con mucha diferencia.

Update: I'm no longer enjoying this, in fact I find it infuriating. However,this is probably due to playing this when tired because this game pressures you to assess food (which doubles as money) and the competition for resources. So not only do you have to grit your teeth but a hand of cards then makes you consider charting alternate ways through this tough environment. The variety of cards is the appealing aspect of the game as each game will be refreshing, but unless you can build a room and start having offspring the process of building an efficient and high scoring farm is plodding and the feeling is compounded by reseeding the board every round. By then towards the end I feel I wringing my forehead to squeeze out where I can gain 1 point without losing out a point somewhere else. So feels like hard labour for little gain, much like running a medieval farm.

Good game, but there are way too many cards to deal with, which add to AP, slow down the game, and reduce the fun, . It does have things that I like in a game: strategy, tactics, tough decisions, very little luck (the initial cards), very little chaos, no easy, direct, or obvious paths to victory.

RATING: 10
If flavor matters to you, and you think farming in 14th century Europe sounds boring, you have yet to sharpen your wits on this brain grind stone of a game.
This is probably one of the best games for a serious gamer. A little more playable than Power Grid due maybe to slightly less complex mechanics and mechanical functions to track than PG demands.  It's only flaw for us is that a high bad/good luck on the initial hand deal can have a bit of impact. To that end we over deal and discard down to the appropriate hand size. This has significantly helped make this a very low luck factor game, that is highly player choice weighted for outcome. Unforgiving, lengthy and fairly complex, this game can become a mainstay at any game table that enjoys that, I surly could have done better next time feel. You'll be Kevin Bacon pleading, thank you sir may I have another. But next week, it is a bit lengthy to fit two plays into one game night.

Suggest you all play without all the big cards a few times. Agricola is growing on me.

I have fun every time I play this. It's interactive in ways that don't make sense, I'll acknowledge that, but I still love that it is at least somewhat interactive. There's a lot to do.

Worst part of this game by far is setup and tear down.

[floatleft][ImageID=559964][/floatleft][floatright][ImageID=262888][/floatright]Its easy to see why so many people love Agricola. Most people get drawn in by the enticing theme and then stay for the game under the hood. I like Agricola quite a bit but after awhile each game starts to feel the same. The scoring requirements impose significant limitations on the game play options. I always feel pigeonholed at the end of each game to diversify my farm. People claim that the different occupation and minor improvements fluctuate the game enough to increase replay-ability but I disagree, the cards just feel like polished chrome that does nothing to change the overall game underneath. Argicola is the illusion of openness. Despite my qualms, Agricola is still a great game and I would happily play it.

After 1 play of the family game...

Very good game, but there is a lot happening, even in the 'family' game. Not the easiest game to explain, but by the end of the first game, everyone was in the grove.  1st game including explanation took 2 1/2 hours, but there were no complaints. This is with a group that considers a 1 hour game to be 'long'.

Definitely NOT a gateway game. 

Can't wait to try the advanced version. 

Update:
Played the advanced version with 5 players. There was so much going on, my brain started slowly leaking out of my nose. Not for the faint of heart. If I wasn't so busy at work, I'd call in sick so I could play some more.  The downside is the game really CAN be determined by the opening deal. Next time we'll try the drafting variant.

--Update 2: After 8 years between playing it the first time and now, we've grown as gamers, realized our introduction was from a scatterbrained and confusing teacher, and accepted that Agricola is a gold standard game that belongs in the pantheon of modern board games.

RATING: 6
There was a time when I was obsessed with Agricola. The trouble I wound up in was this repetitive feeling I got when forced to expand my worker pool. The dance to see who got to use the family growth action first, and who got to use the family growth without room spot got tiresome. I tried solving this apparent issue by over-expanding the game. I bought every card deck, and the Farmers of the Moore expansion. The problem wasn't solved, but the game did get unwieldy. I had to use white cardboxes to old the overflow. I liked the extra action cards you could select with the Moore expansion, but it always frustrated me that the card backs were different, and so it couldn't be smoothly integrated into the game. I sold the lot some time ago when Caverna came out, as Caverna has a many-workers strategy and a few-workers strategy.

Well, some time went by and I played someone else's copy of Agricola again, and it went more or less how I remembered. It did feel good to get back into it even if the experience itself hadn't changed remarkably. That's when I got curious about the revised edition. The revised edition rebalances the cards, and cuts the player count down to 4. Perhaps this helps to lessen some of the issues I had? I'm not sure yet. For now the revised version sits on the shelf waiting for me to get the itch again. I'm hoping it re-lights the fire in my heart for Agricola.

It's not that the game is bad - it's that I thoroughly don't enjoy it. The scoring system (a mix of nonlinear 'buckets' and negative points) makes the game more about not scoring negative points than it is about scoring positive points. I cannot emphasize enough how much I dislike this mindset. The straw that breaks the camel's back is that if you mess up badly, you might as well forfeit, because you will never recover. The best you can do at that point is try to bring someone else down.

With some tweaks and house rules, I'd probably give this a 6 or 7. The game is *close* to being my kind of game.

:thumbsup: Wonderful worker placement that scales well, offers plenty of tough, interesting decisions and a high degree of tension as you struggle to do as much as possible when you simply cannot do everything. I've enjoyed mainly solo games in which I find it quite enjoyable to sit for an hour or so playing with my animeeples and vegimeeples. That type of play offers more of a sense of powering up your farm if you play the series and keep an Occupation each time. Very different from the multi-player games which really shine with the incredible tension, sweet spot being 2-4 players. While it's true that player interaction is somewhat limited to mostly blocking other players, that in itself can be quite brutal. I love the cards and agree with others who recommend a draft as the best way of mitigating random hands of junk. The fun is ALL in the cards. The family version must be dull as all hell. In the end, it's one of the more agreeable resource management games I've played, not being a fan of the genre. At least with Gric, the narrative supports the resource optimization and makes all the difference, as compared to say Le Havre, which falls flat for me.    

:thumbsdown: The game can feel quite fiddly. It's the only factor that requires me to be in the mood to play this. Sometimes I just find re-filling the board with bits every turn to be quite tedious. And of course, the rule book is awful--completely sleep-inducing. Took me over a year to get this to the table because I'd look at that rule book and it all seemed so much more complicated than it is. Thank goodness for video reviews.

My desire to play this is on the wane. The most interesting part of the game is analysing your initial cards and possible combinations, but if you don't like them, there's nothing you can do about it.

Finally got to play it again after 3 years when I just started board gaming. Played with expansion Farmers of the Moor w/o card draft. An AP-prone game for me, offering a variety of options with limited actions. I had to keep referring to the scoring table to get more points, which I struggled with. Luckily I got a part of the points from occupations and didn't lose too badly. Wouldn't mind playing it again.

Have played a 5 player game and a 3 player game. Lower my rating to a 5 if playing with 5 players. The game is fun with 3, but too little choices left with 5 players. Also, with 5 players the game takes too long. I do have a few issues with the game though. 

For one, so many minor and profession cards is overkill. It takes you 2 or 3 turns just to read them all, or you can wait 20 minutes to start the game while you read them.

Two, the game is basically multi-player solitaire. The most that you can do to someone is take an action away from them. There isn't any backstabbing or interaction here.

Finally, the end game is very anti-climatic and seems to happen right when you get your farm going. There is no tense feeling at the end of this game.

For what it is, it is still a fun game. Doesn't deserve the #1 BGG rating though.

So much fun, even without the decks... we've introduced this to several of our friends as a more complex follow-up to Stone Age.

I upped it to a 10 after playing it solo several times. That did it. When I can have [almost] as much fun playing a game alone as I can with others, it's a classic.

I really enjoy this game.  You really have to do a little bit of everything, yet just like in Puerto Rico, there's so many different ways to do well.  The randomness of the cards is both a blessing and an irritant, but overall I really like the high level of replay value.  I also think its designed really well for different numbers of players.

Great game.Plays especially well with 2.
Not that great with new players as the gameplay is tough and tense.
It is very satisfying to build your farm from scratch and at the same time worrying about avoiding starvation.

Many choices and paths to win. I can see that the replay value of this is high. However, that being said, more of the same. Plays like Caylus and Pillars. Certainly not my #1 rated game( but a vast improvment over Puerto Rico)

My dad thinks this game has no intrigue but even if he fails to see its rustic charm I find it quite cute. There's a lot going on - it's complexities make it tricky to pick up but engagingly tactical once you get into it. The trouble is it's just a bit too fussy and, I suppose I have to concede that there are themes more compelling than farming.

RATING: 3
Balancing your checkbook; the game! A three hour story-problem from middle school math in which you are dealt a hand of cards which determine if you win or lose. The next 3 hours are just spent moving fiddly bits and resolving the hand's pre-determined win, place or show.

RATING: 5
First 4-player game was interesting (only 19 points). Need more plays to see how to get a resonable score. Second 5 player game with the K deck demonstrated how much experience is important and that, if you screw up and don't get a food production engine going early, you're doomed. The Family game is necessary to get a feel for how it all should work. I'll be there a few more times before raising my rating.

Just do not enjoy playing this game.

Finally played the famed agricola. It has that same intriguing/infuriating quality as Puerto Rico ("why is my strategy not going anywhere?" but I think there is about 40% too much complexity to be a truly great game.

I've heard so much about this game since it is a classic Euros and one of the most highly touted games of all time. As a new player, it felt extremely punishing. Even though I was given the rules, I wasn't told what type of strategy to pursue. There's so much to do and always somebody blocking the action space you want. Playing with 5 players took almost 4 hours. Maybe playing with 2-3 players might be a better experience for me. Still a decent and interesting game.

The definitive worker placement game, take it as you may. I like the random useful/lessness of the occupation cards and minor improvements, but for playing with others I think drafting is probably a better way to distribute them. 

Solo play is difficult to beat the target scores, multiplayer favors people with experience, as you might expect from a Eurogame. Have fun being 17th century farmers!

Played with drafting hands and an experienced player. With drafting, the game becomes an engine builder as much as a worker placement, a perfectly assembled hand of minor improvements and workers leads to amazing farms with tons of resources, but makes it a very different game. Not for me.

The very language dependent game pieces - for me unfortunately in German - without the owner taking the time to create and sleeve the English paste ups the game would have been unplayable. 
However, I much prefer language on the cards to obtuse icons where I'm constantly flipping though the rule book, I'll just have to wait until the English version comes out. 
Edit:
With the English version now out this is not an issue - except to complement the designer on using words rather than icons.

Theme farming? growing a family in the late middle ages? Wow! be still my heart. However, the play reflects the theme, including the victory where you have to be reasonably self sufficient. Just wish there was some trading element. The game play also revolves around the turn order to get a useful role. A redeeming grace is the use of cards to drive what you are able to do. 

A solid worker placement games, which ultimately is not one of my favorite genres.

I would like to see the Antebellum South version - you know with improvements to the big house, growing cash crops, and instead of begging if you don't grow enough food - family members get sold...

Want to play Agricola?  I'll play anytime, anywhere, no questions asked.  In my humble and sincere opinion, Agricola is the pinacle of board game evolution.  It's feverishly fast beginning leads into a tense mid-game as you hone your farming machine.  Just as you get it up and running, the game twists a corner and you're already at the end... leaving you wanting that extra turn or two so you could just do those last couple of actions that would have made your poor dirt farm into a massive family ranching corporation.  If I owned this game, I would probably hardly ever play any other games... that's just how good I think it is.  A++!

I'm not very good at this one, but no games elicit the types of emotions from me as this one.  It seems like every turn in the game is of the utmost importance and to some this may lead to AP.  But that's what I love about it.  It is a mental battle trying to plan ahead and work out the optimum actions to take!

RATING: 10
Simply the best. A masterpiece.
Over 200 plays and still can't get enough of it. "What is your second best game?" could be a hard question and my answer could vary from time to time, but number one is no contest.
Agricola is unique, feels different from the rest. I don't know if it's because of the theme, the mechanics, the variety of cards, actions, choices...
But for some reason, performing the simple duties in the farm when playing (not necessarily winning) Agricola provides us with a kind of satisfaction that we get with no other game.

One of the best authors game out there with Twilight Struggle and 1960 MotP. The game material is superb specily if you have the animeeples. The rules are clear and the rulebook is effective in delivering the information. The mecanic of the game is not that hard to explain and to play but there is a lot of possibilities that are not obvious specialy for a beginner. The knowledge of the cards make the game a little bit less accessible because a player that have already played the game is more inclined to make the right combo of cards and be advantage compared with a new player even if both players are of the same caliber. The scoring is a little bit odd where an empty field is worth the same value has a field containing animals (shouldn't it worth more?).
I have bought the game in the frenzy of Agricola and to familiarised myself with the cards. But it's not the kind of game that I rate has one of my top.
Update july 1st 09: I increased the rating from 7.5 to 8 after playing a few game without the cards. I prefere this way of playing because it's not a card optimisation game. It becomes a management game where every player start on an even basis. You are not stuck in a situation where an experienced player, who knows the right card combos, will take an uncatchable lead, while a less experienced player will suffer trying to optimize a hand of cards that may not be good at the start. It's better this way because you do not feel like you start the game with two strikes du to a bad initial card distribution. 

Un des meilleur jeu d'auteur sur le marché avec twilight struggle et 1960 MotP. Le matériel de jeu est superbe, spécialement si vous avez les animeeples. Les règles sont claires et le livre des règlements est bien fait et livre bien l'information. La mécanique de jeu est simple et facile à expliquer, par contre elle offre plusieures possibilités ce qui n'est pas très évident pour un débutant. La connaissance des cartes rend le jeu moins accèssible car un joueur ayant joué peut plus facilement effectuer les bons combos de cartes comparativement à un joueur qui en est à sa première partie, même si celui-ci est du même calibre que les autres joueurs. Le décompte final est un peu bizarre ou un paturage vide vaut les même points qu'un paturage avec des animaux (ne devrait-il pas valoir plus?).
Je l'ai acheté dans la folie Agricola et surtout afin de pouvoir me familiariser avec les cartes, car ce n'est pas un jeu qui révolutionne le monde du jeu. Ce n'est toutefois pas un jeu que je considère être dans mes meilleurs.
Mise à jour: J'augmente la note de ce jeu de 7.5 à 8 après avoir joué quelques parties sans les cartes. Je préfère cette façon de jouer car ce n'est plus un jeu de gestion et d'optimisation d'une main de cartes. Le jeu devient un jeu de gestion et d'optimisation ou chaque joueur débute la partie sur un pied d'égalité. Vous n'êtes pas pris dans une situation ou un joueur d'expérience pourra optimiser son combo de cartes et prendre une avance insurmontable alors qu'un joueur moins expérimenté aura toutes les misères du monde à optimiser sa main de carte, alors qu'elle n'est peut être pas bonne dès le départ. Ainsi, c'est nettement meilleur de cette façon car vous n'avez pas l'impression de débuter la partie avec deux prises à votre actif car vous n'avez pas une bonne main de cartes.

Has a very accessible theme for a board game.

Comment from Great Agricola Hoax during BGG CON III: I hear there are too many cards in a foreign language (note: this was entered during BGG CON III and there is method to the madness) -- St. Elvis suggest a turnabouts-is-fair-play, so I'm giving this game an artificial high rating for a day or so.  Update: I had it rated 1.75 for a day and 9.98765 for a day.  At the end of Day 2, the game had not suffered in any way (except possibly for exposing the, um, fervent devotion of a few individuals). Note: I don't own the game, but I've paid in full on pre-order via PayPal.  Update of 8/5/08: it arrived.  Still unopened.

Game is still unplayed, but I figured I should rate the game based on that very fact--that I've owned it and looked at the rules and still choose to leave it sitting on a shelf.  For once, I used the suggested rating scale on BGG and rated the game based on my desire to bring it out and it gets a 4.  If I ever do play it, I will rate it on the official Randy Scale.

A brilliant game, but so punishing in terms of tightness to feed your workers. I've found this very difficult to get players interested in outside of serious fans of Euro games. Therefore with my current playing groups with mostly non-gamers and family, this will not go over well. I love playing on the app though, and won't turn down the chance to play in real life when able. 
Still don't own a physical copy, but have my eye on the 2017 Collectors/Anniversary edition. Most of my plays are on the app. 

Update: After eclipsing 100 plays and still going, Agricola has a wonderful depth with all the various cards presenting new opportunities every game. Learning to make use of the best combos at the start of every game, while constantly trying to prioritize the right spaces leads to a rich experience that is still enjoyable. This is a game worthy of the 10 rating for me, and so now it is.

This game is one of the best games I have played in a long time. You may think it maybe complicated but it really is very simplistic. It has the feel of Caylus, but it isn't as harsh in blocking people and there is many many ways to go about things. There's so many different possible strategies that it has a ton of replayablity. It's easily one of the top games of this year.

Nem rossz játék, de a szerző más játékait kicsit jobban kedvelem. Picit tán túllihegett nekem az Agricola "őrület". Le Havre, Ora et... nálam két körrel is lekörözi. Ennek ellenére amikor rászánom magam egy játékra, nem mondom, hogy nem élveztem. Nagyon bízok a Farmers of the moor-ban, hogy nagyobb életet visz a játékba. Kevésbé szeretem ki-be pakolászni is.:)
Update: két év múlva jöttem rá, hogy egy apró de lényeges dolgot rosszul játszottunk,így egy kissé nehezebbé vált. Ezt a farmers of the moor-nál jött elő. együtt a jó szabállyal játszva nagyon-nagyon sokat nőt a szemembe.
Szóval egyszerűen fel KELL pontoznom.
Családi körben is kipróbálva, családi verzióval kártyák nélkül. Azért most már értem miért volt igencsak jó helyen a BGG-n. A gyerekek is nagyon jól és gondolkodva fejlesztették a farmjukat. Bár kikaptak, de csak a rutintalanságuk miatt.
Újabb update: Lehet ez lesz az áttörés,a kislányom azt mondta, hogy játszunk újra. Ettől a mondattól még a könnyem is kicsordult, azok után, hogy olyan méla undorral viseltetett a társasok iránt, hogy nem tudtam, hol rontottam el. :D

RATING: N/A
I call this my favorite anti-game, and explaining why is going to highlight a lot about what I like and dislike about "these kinds of games" in general. 

A lot of its characteristics are things I don't care for in other games. Worker placement? Not my favorite way to select actions. Cascading turn order, where you disproportionately benefit through no skill of your own if you sit to the left of the guy who keeps taking Start Player? Again, not my favorite. Low direct interaction? Special power cards? Lots of bits requiring upkeep and seeding and (re)arranging? Individual player boards? In isolation, these things don't really do it for me, and that means most of the modern Eurocraze is lost on me. 

I'm a gardener, though, and so the harvest aspect of Agricola appeals to me. I don't ordinarily rely on theme in a game, but in this case, it's a draw. Growing your own food is engaging to me, and growing your own food without industrial intervention is also important to me. 

Agricola also captures the general angsty, anxious feel of being a subsistence farmer. I enjoy the dread, and the desperation, and the stress that comes from the accelerating schedule. Yes, it's a "pay the game back" gimmick, but again, thematically, it works in Agricola. What do you do with food? You grow it and eat it. If you don't eat, there are consequences. This all makes sense to me. 

But Agricola is a dead-end to me in Eurogaming. It is the only game I need that features an individual player board, or worker placement, or resource conversion. Certainly the only one I'd ever play against other people. I do occasionally play this solo (gate-to-gate in 30 minutes), and while I don't do it often, I do enjoy it -- I don't always need to have other people around if all I feel like doing is sequencing and optimizing.

02/02/2013: Was interested in the game for the theme. Bought it and tried out for two solo plays to understand the rules and gameplay. As much as I wanted to get into the game, it became more dull as I played through. The game only started to come alive once  my food supply was secure, but it was already too late in the game to improve my farm/hut to up my score. The game felt very fiddly too, and managing all the bits (e.g placing resources in their respective spaces on the board at the start of every turn) undoubtably took some attention away from the gameplay which didn't help to improve the gaming experience. It is difficult to keep track of the score (and who is winning in a multi-player game), though I appreciated the reasoning behind the way the scoring was designed. 

All in all, a disappointing experience with a game that I really wanted to like but couldn't.

I am not a big fan, in fact I do not like "efficiency engine" games. Slowly build up a proficient farm and so forth is just not my cup of tea. I prefer limited options (not due the lack of family counters but lack of options in general) and more luck, luck, luck. Random events, dice, and so forth. Without random elements, it is not a game, it is a puzzle, a calculation exercise, pure stress, no fun. If I want to do something that requires a lot of energy and results in something very efficient, I go to work or take a math exam. So, Agricola is not my type of game. No surprise there, seeing that I do not like Dungeon Lords, Dominion and RFTG for the same reason. I have not played with the interactive deck, so I cannot comment on that but Agricola felt like a multi-solitaire game to me, everybody is building his own little farm and there is some interaction (choice of action) but that is it. Not my cuppa.HX

Finally broke down to the hype and got Agricola, which has become a quick favorite for my wife and youngest son. I prefer Le Havre, but I'm enjoying this much more than Loyang. We've added some extra items to it: http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66303/my-minor-expansions

Bought this after playing a game that I enjoyed greatly; the second game was also fun, but a little less enticing, and the solo game didn't grab me the first time. It might just need more plays...

Great game.  I prefer the family version (sans occupations and minor improvements), as it's easier to see your opponent's strategies and there's less over analysis, thereby making the game play more quickly.

Such a bucolic theme is wonderful.  I do love the amazingly large amount of different things you can do during the game.  But in the end it feels like a bunch of recycled ideas from Puerto Rico and Caylus only less engaging despite the largeness of the presentation.

Lots of stress and betrayal playing the game. Very competitive game. Not very well balanced for different skill level players playing together.

I am on the bandwagon.  This is as close to a 10 as possible for a non-wargame.  It is good.  It is great.  It is fun.  It is wonderful.  It is not boring.  It is expandable.  It is the best Eurogame.  

Well a little long for 5 players.

So, I have to do it.  This is a 10.

--------------------------

OK, so I have had to downgrade this game.  One cannot get the satisfaction of creating killer combos.  You cannot get them out in the 14 rounds.  Sad, but true. [9] 05/29/2012

CAVEAT: I don't particularly like worker placement/role selection games.

Why I think his game took the #1 spot formerly occupied by Puerto Rico:

[1] Greatly appeals to Magic: The Gathering fans and ex-fans (which I believe make up the vast majority of BGG users) with that huge deck of special power cards, from which players get only 14 cards for the entire game, which ensures that each player is confronted with the puzzle creating some uber-powerful combo.

[2] Hardly confrontational, like typical worker placement games. The only confrontation is selecting a role that one of your opponents badly needs -- and you'll only do that if picking that role rewards you; there is no gain by simply hurting an opponent in the lead. This caters to the Euro game fan who really can't handle direct confrontation or even prolonged player interaction, despite what they say. I blame this on their undeveloped social skills.

In the case of Agricola, the little player interaction there is simplistic when compared to Puerto Rico, which has much more varied player interaction.

[3] Simplistic strategies. Euro gamers (again, despite what they say) prefer tactical games over strategic ones. Euro gamers think that strategic games are those that have multiple paths to victory, but each of those paths don't have much variety. It's actually a bit worse in Agricola; there is really only one way to win -- simply get everything.

[4] Hardly elegant. I prefer games that achieve great depth with a minimal rule set. The "depth" from Agricola is derived from all those individual special rules for each role and playing card. (This is closely related to point [1].)

I simply do not enjoy games with these four qualities. However, Agricola has several redeeming features:

(a) Different variants of play depending on the skill levels of the players. I prefer the family version in which players do not receive any special cards. In this version, players are more focused on what their opponents are doing.

(b) Very good theme integration.

(c) Relatively quick play (for the family version).

Agricola is not a bad game, though the time needed to replenish the resources makes it a tiring game. A game that can be played in under one hour can take a lot more due to this.

The rules are very confusing. I would recommend watching youtube video tutorials to learn how to play. Once you learn how to play its a great game. Though I do feel that the person who gets the best occupation cards ends up winning the game regardless of the strategy you end up using.

RATING: 8
This game requires a large table (we played four players comfortably, however five would have cramped us on my 4'x6' table), a bit more set up time than I'm used to and involves a bit of accounting (fortunately a counting pad is provided).  I did enjoy the game and definately will play it again.  Like I said there is a lot to it with a lot of different strategies.  You have to make due with the occupation and minor improvement cards you are dealt.  Use combos as much as you can.  Look at the little cheat sheet cards to understand what gives you points and what takes points away.  I did buy and add animeeples and vegimeeples to make it a little more interesting to play.

Pros:
1. Stressful, but in a good way. Difficult to balance accomplishing things that will give you points and feeding your family.
2. Tough decision points. At no point during this game is it clear what you should be doing. In the sense, that there's so much that needs to be done, it's difficult to determine what's most important.
3. Variability. The minor improvements and professions can really change how you attack each games.
4. Thematic. You are physically building a farm on your tableau. The point scoring is definitely arbitrary, but to see the physical manifestation of your progress is very nice.
5. Forced to diversify - Focusing only on one strategy will almost guarantee a loss. You have to focus on multiple things to grow a diverse farm.

Cons:
1. Long game play. This game takes a bit to play. I expect at least 2 hours when I put this game to the table.
2. Analysis Paralysis. This is the reason for number 1. You will have players who will just freeze up and take a long time to make their decision.
3. While there are multiple roads to victory there is one thing you must focus on. You MUST grow your family. It scores too many points and allows you more actions. Early in the game this can cause a bit of a bottle neck if you are continually blocked from that spot.

Summary: This is one of the best worker placement euros out there. Lots of hard decisions to make. It's actually rather forgiving, a "bad move" at the start of the game can very likely help you a little later. You might say "UGH, why did I take this wood now" then a few turns later you're saying "Thank god I took that wood a few turns ago."

The upside:
- Farming in 17th century turns out more fun that you'd expect.
- You can't leave none behind type of game. You have to try to make the most of every single aspect of your farm.
- Looking for destroying combos in the cards you get and trying to make them work in time to help you win.
- So much stuff you want do but so few people(actions) to do it.

The downside:
- The cards dealt at the beginning can set players at different "distances" to victory.
- Table space needed is something to take into account.

Having only just played the single version of the game, my initial reaction is that this probably is a fantastic game that I will always play, however, I have to play this game a few more times to see if it grows on me. I have played the family game about 6 times alone to just get a feel for the game and plan on introducing it to my non-playing family! This rating should increase!

RATING: 7.3
There's a lot of good in this game, but it has the flaw that the cards you're dealt dictate what you can and can't do for the first few turns, and ultimately what you should and shouldn't do for the entire game.  I love games where you collect resources and use them to build things to improve your abilities to collect more resources, and so on.  I've played probably 20 games like that, including this one, and liked them all.  But this one suffers from a feeling that I had almost no control, since the only two sensible actions to take (given the cards I had been dealt) were almost always taken by the time it was my turn, leaving me to choose among actions that made no sense to take (given the cards I had been dealt).  I've also played a lot of games where players interfere with each others' plans, and liked them all, so it isn't just that.  It's the combination of the two: a starting setup that dictates a particular plan, that then becomes impossible due to the actions of other players. It's also penalized by some scoring mechanics that create utterly illogical actions: I scored a lot of points just by plowing 6 fields, even though I NEVER planted anything in them.  That was ridiculous. (Guess what: it was because of a card I was dealt.)  I might rate this higher or lower with more plays, but for right now the best I can give it is a 7.6, and I think I'm being generous with that. (Second play: dropped the rating slightly, same reasons as before: the cards dictated what I could do, and I ended up dead last. If I ever won, it would feel like it was merely because of getting good cards. It isn't a bad game as it stands, but I would make a house rule: placing on the occupation space would let you pick from 7 face-up occupation cards laying beside the board, and placing on minor improvement would act similarly.)

A game I used to love. Agricola was probably the third serious board game that I picked up. I really don't enjoy playing it anymore. I find it tedious, unfun, and to be honest, the main reason I don't like it, is I find it to be poorly designed and it wasn't until I played Le Havre, which I hated, that I saw all the flaws in the game.

Im probably two years behind everybody else but Im looking forward to getting this. In fact im buzzing. I cant believe a game about farming would have me this excited. Not even a farm under attack by zombies or a farmer with chainsaw, not even aliens in the stable scaring the horses. Just farms, harvests, cycle of life stuff, critters and vegetables.Bring it on..
UPDATE. This is my favourite game at the moment, I completely ignored this game for ages reckoning that any game about farming and pushing bits of wood about must be boring, not so.
I love this game for several reasons...
- It has a great theme which it carries very well (1700s substinence farming!!).The harvest mechanic is a real tension point of the game which I love. This is about survival really, oh and getting loads of points.
- The quality of the art and components, and the tactile nature of the pieces.
- the cards, apart from the fact there are so many of them and they scale with the number of players involved.
They also mean you have get a different game everytime and have to adopt different strategies in play. Brilliant clever well designed and beautifully themed game, although im not sure about the Farmers expansion though.

RATING: 9
"Agricola" is worker placement in its finest. It's tight on resources and there's a lot of action denying. As if that was not enough, you often feel like you're on the verge of starving, and because of that, it's a very brutal game.

Not everyone enjoys the tension of feeding in "Agricola" and that's understandable. It's not uncommon to be dependant on a single action and sometimes your opponent will take advantage of that, making you cry a little bit inside. To really enjoy the game, you have to be prepared for that. But at the same time, it's very rewarding. Watching your farm grow is amazing and when your little precious engine starts working, you do feel proud of your achievements.

There's also a lot, and I mean, A LOT of replayability even in the base box, and with all the expansions it's almost infinite. Each game plays differently and figuring out the best combination of cards is a satisfying experience. One of the best, a game that will never leave my collection.

It's not a bad design, but I just can't get excited about building my farm. Maybe it's just that I've always played with more experienced people, and I feel like I just don't get this game in comparison.

I really don't enjoy this much. I respect it as well designed but don't enjoy it. 
Everyone has to do essentially the same things so the game bottlenecks around certain needed actions and feels very brutal if you get blocked. The game frames the consequences as punishment for missed oppurtunity instead of reward for oppurtunity taken. The game makes very little thematic sense, why are neighboring farmers in such tight competition (particularly to build a bigger home and to have kids with their spouses)? Furthermore, everything that is done in the game feels very very expensive. ~12/18/13

Like this a lot but it has fallen out of favour. My wife says it is stressful and feels like work, so we always tend to choose something else. My parents have played it (and enjoyed it) but I think I have won every single time - I'm sure this is part of the reason why it doesn't get played more. I think there is so much strategy to discover and I'd really like to play more to try to explore the possibilities.

Traded Dec 2015. I did enjoy this game but I felt increasingly restricted by the tightness of the gamespace. There just isn't enough scope to explore and try things "for the heck of it" because actions are so tight and the game will beat you hard if you lose ground. I got frustrated having a hand of cool cards most of which I knew I wouldn't be able to play. I may require it one day (with some vegimeeples) if the urge takes me as there are still aspects to the game that I enjoy.

Despite my play count on this one, Agricola has never failed to... underwhelm. Still popular today eight years after it's release, though perhaps overshadowed by Caverna, Agricola was a force to be reckoned with in it's day (vying with Twilight Struggle for the coveted #1 spot for quite some time). This fascination and love of Agricola I have never fully understood. It is entertaining, yes, but I have always felt extremely anxious while playing it. One may say this is a triumph as anxiety and uncertainty fit in superbly with the theme, but these are not emotions I want to feel while playing any game, even a euro (games prone to exacerbate anxiety in both my wife and I) like Agricola. This is due to the "can't do everything, gotta be as efficient as possible" style of the game play. A modern classic to be sure, just not for me.

This game has just the right amount of randomness: the random cards won't make or break your game, but they do change things up enough that you can't play the same strategy every time. You'll have to play to the odds and have a contingency plan if things don't go your way.

Play can be a bit slow, but the pacing is quite consistent. Turns don't tend to take longer as the game progresses, as happens in many other games. Your choices are limited enough that you rarely get stuck trying to make a decision, but each one is important to the end game.

The state of the game is also very clear. You can tell without too much trouble who is winning and who isn't, who has or needs what, and get an idea of what your opponents might be doing. I don't find myself wishing I had better insight into what is happening in this game, whereas I do in many others.

The biggest downside is the amount of work that needs to be done every turn to move and stock pieces. It really slows down the game to spend 25% of your time moving wooden discs. I think this could be alleviated somewhat if the pieces were in a tray rather than in bags, or if rotating counters were used instead of tokens.

Overall, this is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. It's interactive without being aggravatingly competitive, it's long but not too long, and it's just random enough to keep things different without making strategy building impossible.

There's a reason this is still one of the highest rated board games on BGG!

Right now, I do not understand Agricola.  I mean, I can play it all right, and if I am playing with another first time player, I have a chance to win, but there are a lot of different variables.  That does not mean, however, that I do not like Agricola.  I really enjoy building my farm, making sure I have enough animals left that they can breed and planting crops.  I love placing my family members--and heck, I like building my family.  But this game is a lot of work.  It's not one that I would say, "let's play again."  I am exhausted after Agricola.  I might say, "Let's play again tomorrow."

***Update(12-26-09)***

After ten plus plays, I finally think I've got a handle on the sorts of strategies that I might employ.  I've even done some experimenting with different strategies to see what works.  I've come to the conclusion that it is very bad to pay too much attention to the cards.  Focus on family improvement and build up the house.  I think my brother (the only person who will play Agricola with me) has won once or maybe twice out of our 11 games so far, so there must be something about the strategy that I've figured out that he hasn't.  It's strange because he usually has a much higher win percentage than I do in most other games.

It's all about the engine. And the face on your opponent when you steal that huge pile of wood microseconds before they were about to.

The base game has so much replay value that I've rarely used any of the extra cards, and only touched the Farmers of the Moor expansion once.

The solo challenge is also fun, though I'd rather play this game with people.

Nobody seems to get why I don't like this game.  And I can't explain it.  I like Carson City better, and Le Havre even better than that.  But I don't really play any of them very often.

Okay, I'm just a slow learner.  Now that I've had some chances to play the solitaire game, I'm ready to try again.  And I don't know that I like Carson City all that much anymore either.

After an afternoon with a hard copy of the game, plodding my way through a solitaire game, I gained enough of an understanding to be able to use the online versions of the game, and now I am finally able to appreciate this game.  But now I've moved away from all my friends that own a copy.

My favourite boardgame so far.

After 5-10 plays it may look like a card draw determines the winner. That's why i suggest using card drafting. It takes additional few minutes but for Agricola fans this will be a great fun and will add even more depth to the game.

Great fun and lots of options.  Though, not enough direct interaction.  I want to try this game out again and create a variant to spice up the interaction between players.  I love the theme and some of the mechanics of the game, but I hate the way the game plays out (obtuse scoring round, difficulty in feeding family is harsh on new players, etc).  

Great solo game, but don't know if I will play it in a group setting again.

This game is like Caylus off the rails.  Tons of complex decisions, tight resource management, numerous viable paths to victory, great components, tremendous replay value, and a lot of fun.  This game has everything (except trains).  And, for some reason, I love the theme.  With Agricola, I may never want to play Caylus again.  The cards add interesting variance and replayability, but also a little random chaos and unbalance.  It's a good blend that should broaden the appeal of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
When I first heard about this game, it left me cold. Farming as a theme seemed booooring to me. I was wrong... The 3 things that make this game so wonderful are:
1) lack of time: you never have time to do everything in this game! You must make decisions, based on importance.
2) Replayability: the occupations and improvements make this game forever replayable. Wonderful!
3) Your workers also eat!!! You have to build an engine, else you will lose. 
The nr. 1 posision on this site is not a coincidence, it truly deserves it.

It does play well and there are many different ways to either get a ton of points or to cripple yourself.  After about ten plays using the various decks it becomes easier to consistantly score high.  Games are usually close despite play not being very player-agressive.

The expansion would renew interest, but for how long?  Despite this fact, Agricola is a keeper and it still gets play-time.

I prefer Caylus since it is very similar to Agricola, but may be played more cut-throat.

I really appreciate this game on a design level, I enjoy the way things fit together and how everything works, the way cards result in differing strategies whenever the game is played, etc.  I readily admit that this is a brilliant game, but I also find it supremely frustrating.  It always feels like I'm one action short of doing what I really want to, always having to settle for compromised plans and intentions.  As a result, this game is stressful.  To be fair I've only played a handful of times, and more plays are definitely required.

It's hard for me to admit this isn't a "bad" game. I just find it extremely tedious and boring. I also strongly dislike the massive deck of cards and how much the initial draw/draft/setup sways the game. This wouldn't even be in my top 500 games, so when people claim it is #1 I occasionally can't hold my tongue. A 6 is as high of a rating I can give to a mediocre game with such an insistent fanbase. :P

The base game is better with 5 than with 2. (The "Farmers of the Moor" expansion makes it good with two.) A good game, but hasn't grabbed me the way it seems to have grabbed everyone else.

•Family variant of the game (see rule book) is less complex and perfect for introducing the game. (removes extra cards like improvements and occupations)

•Takes a while to learn the game (usually half way through for new players)

You may like the many cards, but to me they feel as to hide the weakness of the game. The uneven rounds with harvesting show that the designer saw a problem of players getting too many stuff, so he decides to give the world a bit of a spin - towardst the end rounds/seasons get shorter. If offered to a large publisher, they would reject it as too unbalanced, too many bits, still too much a prototype. And that's how it feels to me: a prototype.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a solid and enjoyable game in the family of Caylus. I find it more enjoyable than Caylus because the theme is more personal: the struggle to feed your family feels real.  However the expansion cards seem to weaken the theme, especially the occupation cards, as suddenly your poor old husband and wife are holding down four jobs between them as well as running the farm! Player interaction is present, as trying to guess which action you can leave for the next round of picking is critical and the openly displayed resources help with this. However it doesn't usually seem to have a lot of tension or excitement.

First Euro type game I played and owned.  It's a great game, but you need to have some gamers to play.  It was so cute when I played with my daughter (she was 8 at the time) and all she wanted to do was raise sheep and make sure she had excess food for her family....no interest in diversification....nor would she slaughter a sheep for food! :)  I guess we all enjoy games for different reasons!

Edit:  We finally made the jump from the family game....should have done that a while ago.  The cards really make the game much more engaging and enjoyable.

A very pure and excellent worker placement game. Agricola  has certainly one of the best (or the best) theme-mechanic-integration of all Euro-games. However, the game can be very cut-throat if the someone takes the worker spots you need and you fail to gather enough food for your family. 

The different occupation and improvement cards give  a lot of variety, but many of them are clearly inferior to others, such that there is some luck of which cards you are dealt in the beginning. I think fewer, more balanced cards in the game and being dealt fewer cards (maybe 3 instead of 7) would improve the game.  

I personally do not like how advantageous it is to increase your family, which pretty much makes the game be a race of which player gets additional family members first (which is certainly not a trivial task).

Initial rating 7.5

[i]Update: Rating increased from 7.5 to 8.5 after 5th play[/i]
With additional plays you get more skilled in using the cards you are dealt effectively. There are better cards than others, but you can "work" with most hands. If you already plan in the beginning rounds to increase your room number, you also do not fall behind much in the race for  the first additional family members. 

I am still not really impressed by the scoring, which turns the last two rounds in getting certain animals or grains which you actually really do not "need" for your farm business. But this is only a minor point and does spoil the fun you have had when building up your farm during the previous 13 rounds. 

As I now have also played more modern worker placement games, I am impressed how good Agricola (and Caylus) is in comparison to those.

[i]Update2: Rating decreased to 8[/i]
I do not like that the game very often results in a race for who gets the family growth first, which can easily result in rich-get-richer. Besides that, an excellent game.

Definitely better to provide some choices on cards to keep to the players (rather than straight from the deck). We tried a choice of 7 out of 10 of each of the Occupations and Improvements. I thought this may have been too much. Would try with a bit less...

Had to get used to this in the first game. The cards (talents and investments) made it quite difficult to oversee. Probably due to the fact that we just put all cards into the game (with 5 players). Second play was much better once I found a strategy for using my cards.

No also played the family game variant twice (with my family of course). This is a good variant to get to know the game. It's shorter and maybee there's even less luck involved.

A complex set of rules belies a fairly simple game. Essentially worker placement, resource acquisition, improvement, and development of one's farm. Immense replayability with the occupation and improvement cards. Feels like Stone Age, only tougher and less interactive. I love these kinds of games. To win you must develop in all areas, or at least most. Best with 2p. What a game.

I expect that my rating will (would) improve with more plays.  It's just that there is so much other stuff out there that seems more interesting.  Like Endeavor! Second play - enjoyed more than my first - and I see why folks like it - there is plenty of strategy and interesting decision making to be had, but for me it is inelegant and fiddly and relies on stacks of cards with miniscule print on them. [6-3-2010]  Definitely liking the game a bit more after my third play - upgrading rating from a 6 to a 7.  Still too busy in my view with all the cards and bit shuffling but I have to give the Gric its due as a very thematic game that really makes me feel the urgency of subsistance farming.

there is incredible variety to this game. I really like how streamlined this system is while being very deep and variable.  I've recently play Caverna as i appreciate the game but there is something about the streamlined play that I prefer with this game rather than the more complex Caverna.   Solo is really quite fun and thus I improve my rating a bit.  As I seem to play this solo more than with others I don't tend to pull for it because it does take a little to set up and put away.  I usually pull Loyang or Merkator instead because of the quick set and breakdown.

Always a desperate time, even when you think it is going OK. Playing with drafting seems to be most balanced. Drafting does take some time, though. First few plays can be rough as you fight off a sense of panic. After that you can calm down and concentrate on building the farm and learning the patterns needed for each improvement. Then you can start using card interactions to make you more efficient. Then you can advance to trying to slow the other players by varying your actions to hinder theirs.

Picked it up a few months ago and it has been played more in its first few months than any other game I've bought.  Tough decisions.  Great tension.  Cool to look at your farm at the end.  Really enjoying it with wife, Jeff, Tim, Nate, and Pearson. Great with 4 players and my wife and I enjoy the 2-player game a bunch too.  Solo was a little disappointing (I'd rather play Pandemic for solo play).  Wife and I loved Stone Age but haven't touched it since Gric arrived.  Gotta give shout out to Tim (Out4Blood) for his tutoring sessions after games.

Update (Oct. '09): It's been a year and Agricola is my #1 game of all time.  Might go a while without playing it, but whenever I do I'm reminded of why it's my favorite.

Update (Feb. '10): Glory to Rome has pushed Agricola out of the #1 spot in my Top 10.  

Update (Nov. '12): Agricola is back up at my #1 spot.

Dec 2015 update: I've now been convinced that my previous analysis/issues with the game are incorrect - there is a lot more depth to this game, and a much higher skill curve, than I gave it credit for.

June 2011, Previous review: A fine game, but I feel like most games play very similar. Family growth is by far the most important action, and so a lot of your early game is setting up to take family growth. When the family growth card actually flips has a huge impact on the game - if you've prepared for it on turn 5, it's painful if it doesn't flip until turn 7. I've heard the "Farmers of the Moor" expansion fixes a lot of my issues with the game

After ten lovely years of Aggy games the time has come to move what has evolved into a massive, comprehensive collection on.  I picked up every deck along the way.  I brought in the fine E-Raptor player templates that the boards slide into. Not every board, however.  I bought a German copy of the game which had player boards that happened to fit or match up with the templates.

We even kept the game in a Pelicase, with wheels even, to move the thing around and keep it tight.  Every card is premium sleeved and there are a ton.  I bought wooden bits for all the pieces including food in half a dozen different forms.  Fish, chops, veggies.  There are even a bunch of fine looking chicken that we tried to work into the game, without great success.

The German stone house tiles have roofs, some even with storks, the ultimate touch to the game.  Inquire for pics.

Played a couple games with the kids over the weekend.  The economy is tight, which I like.  You're constantly scrabbling for food and balancing that against building up your farm.  The trick is looking for value and getting the timing right.

Update, 1/6/17: We've been playing a bit.  That 8 holds up.  My boys (7 and 9) can play the family game easily and competitively.  I am less enthused about the full game, with minor improvements and occupations.  Yeah, it adds variety, but the family game has a simplicity to it that's refreshing.

 So far only one play since I finally recieved the english edition thanks to Z-Man games pre-order. Love it already, played with five of us and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next. So much to consider in this game, how best to feed the family, which occupation and improvements to establish. The Major improvements are very important to success.
 Tried 2 player with wife and wow that's a fast game. End result was 1 point to -2!

Translation from german made the rule book tough to get a handle on but once understood the rules aren't that complex.  So many things to do, so few resources to do them with.  At first I couldn't understand all the fuss but the more I play the more it grows on me.

RATING: 7.5
Playing this solo to learn it- perhaps the worst rulebook I have yet to meet.  But it seems that the basic gameplay is quite simple, although a few more plays may be necessary before I figure out any strategy.

---

Update- love love love this game- solo or with two.  But I still keep losing- the strategy feels just out of grasp.  I know what to do, and I think I know how to do it, but it's just not working.  Yet.  I *will* figure this out!

---

Update- still love this game, still get my butt kicked regularly.  Finally got to try a 3 player game- wow, was that hard!  Sadly, the husband announced that he doesn't like the game- the theme leaves him cold, turns out, so it will just be 2 of us most of the time again now.  *sniff*

*note: for solo plays I count 1 set of 8 games as 1 play

RATING: 6.38
I stuggle to understand this games ranking. Okay, I've only played it once and came in second 5 points behind (which is, I think, a massive gap in this game) but even so. The game is quite heavy, like Le Havre it overwhelms players with options. You start with 10-16 different things you can do and a new one appears each turn. This is basically quite a clever mechanism but the way it is presented leaves a player having to peer at a dozen or so cards every turn. You then use these options to build up your farm which ultimately scores you victory points.
Unlike Le Havre there is no hierarchy where you turn things into other things which turn into other things to turn into VPs. Even so there are a lot of fiddly little bits to keep an eye on and track.
Also unlike Le Havre it seems to hinge much more on opening strategy and the end-game has the same accelerated feeling I dislike in many much simpler Euro games. 
I resent a learning curve I would normally associate with light wargames in something that does essentially the same thing as medium Euros. If I put that level of time in I want to get a corresponding return. I need to give this and Le Havre a few more games to see what the return is like but my suspicion is they don't represent a good investment.

Bought this having read all the positive reviews.  Not sure if its the complex rules or having recently played Stone Age which was simple to explain and fun to play, but in comparison (which may be unfair), I just can't see the appeal currently.  Hoping to change my mind...

20.11.2011 - Quick update, having ditched the family game version and had 5 games last weekend, this game is a blast.

20.01.2012 - changing rating from 9 to 8 as a group we've not gone back to it for a while and played the expansion only once.  In comparison to other games played, this is a good game but for some reason not one anyone else suggests playing...

:star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar: Easy to learn
:star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar: Fun factor
:star::star::star::star::star:   Replay-ability


Why this game stays in my collection?
This has not hit the table for sometime, but i've never considered getting rid of it, even with caverna out (which i've yet to play), perhaps due to its lengthy play time in comparison to other games now in my collection.
Would it be a desert island game, certainly.
Oh and a special thanks to The Secret Cabal for this forever being known as Misery Farm in our gaming group.

Agricola fully deserves its status as one of the classics, and I'd almost always be delighted to play it - despite really not being very good at it. The constant tension of trying to scrape together enough food to survive, while building a large and diverse enough farm to score a respectable amount of victory points - and of course never having anywhere near enough actions to do everything you want, or knowing which of several crucial actions is the most important to prioritise right now - really makes Agricola what it is. And the occupation and minor improvement cards give the game near-infinite replayability, as you have to consider which cards to play and when (and how best to utilise the advantages they give you), and which ones are just traps to be avoided.

I still don't rate Agricola higher than 8, though, as these days it's almost never one of my first choices. Partly that's because of Caverna - which is missing a lot of the knife-edge tension, but adds such a wealth of new strategies and options that I'd almost always choose it over Agricola (although I do think there is certainly room for both in a reasonably large collection like ours). But more importantly, for some reason I have rarely find myself in the mood for Agricola over the past year or more (which is also true, to a lesser extent, of Caverna). It's still a great game though, hence my rating remains high.

Good, rather than great game.  I'd much rather play Puerto Rico, Stone Age or Cuba.  I hate the way it forces you to be a jack-of-all-trades by penalising you for every last vegetable, animal etc that you don't have at the end.

Yes, after two plays, this is a must MUST own game.
Preordered. 

And now have! And finally, a third play, with my daughter. Yay!
...
Now, 3 more plays. I haven't played a new game this much since ... I dunno. It's been lot's of fun. Out of six games, I won one! Other's been really close. Thoroughly enjoy it.

Update (7/1/2015): Time rolls on, and Caverna has replaced my Agricola, literally. I have given my copy away to a young friend just starting out on his game collection journey. Caverna hits all the great spots that Agricola does, and fixes all of the blemishes. A Fantastic re-imagining.

Payed forward: given to Scooter.

Pure gold. I absolutely LOVE this game. Don't let the farm theme throw you. When I explain this game to newbies, I get the same look, "are you kidding me, I'm building a farm, planting seeds and baking bread....and this is fun how?". It *seems* very complicated, but it's not once you get going. You will have to play it again to do any good most likely as the first time through you'll be lost as to what's going on.

Terrific game.  I am in the camp that prefers Agricola to Caverna.   The thing I love most about Agricola is getting that hand of cards at the start of the game and trying to build a strategy around it.   Even better if you play with the drafting variant.   Caverna is fun too,  but it loses a lot without the cards.

(8/19/08) - The Alpha.....the Omega.....the one and only! Received via FedEx today. We'll see if it can live up to the hype.

(3/28/09) - [7] - I forgot to rate this months ago after playing 3 times. I find it enjoyable to play but my weakness at economic engine games makes it next to impossible for me to win.

(5/6/13) - Agricola has been sold as part of an overall downsizing of my collection. I would have liked to play it a few more times, but know I am so terrible at economic engine games that I should just save myself the aggravation.

+ More thematic than Lords of Waterdeep
+ Family friendly
+ Get the sense of building an actual farm
+ Animeeples are great

- A bit longer than the average family game, I would recommend Stone Age over this as a family gateway worker placement game
- No resourcemeeples/veggiemeeples (breaks the theme a bit having actual animals and then circular wooden tokens for produce)
- A lot of maintenance/upkeep, updating action spaces with components
- Forces you to do everything and make a balanced farm

(Still needs more plays with the cards to see how that affects the dynamic of the game)

I recently got this after hearing all the rave reviews on BGG. I was not disappointed. This is one of the most beautifully produced games I've ever played, with fantastic components consisting of thick-stock cards, quality game boards, and wooden bits.

I'll play this game just about anytime it's offered!

Lately, Cass and I have been mostly playing the family version when we play it two-player. Without the luck of the profession and minor improvement cards, it's a much more balanced game.

Our first worker placemenent game, and that mechanic has since become one of my favorites.

edit: after 30+ plays I'm kind of burned out on this one

A pleasant game. Handles action selection very well. But a little too dry and mechanical also. A good family game and it scales well between player counts as well as player experience.

Pretty good. I've played two solo games (1 with family rules), several two player family games and several two player E-deck games. Amazing amount of choices. Two of my  concerns are "analysis paralysis" and playing time. The box says 30 min per player but the Geek consensus seems to be more like 45 min to an hour per player. I've found it a little more as we learn. Still a good game probably worthy of the praises. I just don't know how often it will hit our table. For us it sometimes can feel more like work than play.

Update: Taking it up a notch. The family game can be really enjoyable. The full game, even at two-players is too long for us. Maybe more plays will cut down on time.

Update: o.k. it's got me. Long but sooo intriguing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like worker placement style games and really appreciate how well this game scales with a different numbers of players. 

While I do not feel like the "full" is difficult to learn, the simpler family mode is a great way to introduce Agricola to new players. In many ways, I like the family game over the full game because there isn't the randomness with the cards.

I am also a sucker for lots of wooden components and this game does not disappoint!

I suppose you could call this game processional, or even the dreaded "multi-player solitaire," but I still find this much-hyped game a highly enjoyable mental workout. I had an abysmal first experience (due to a poor hand of cards, a sloppy paste-up job, and an inadequate rules explanation), but recent plays with the new English edition are a completely different story. The 400 cards (including the bonus deck)give nearly endless replay value, and the animeeples have a genuine psychological effect on the game: you now think twice about barbecuing that cute sheep.

Played this with my gaming group last night.  Everyone seemed to be all pumped up about this game, but I couldn't see what the big hype was all about.  Fiddly, frustrating and frankly boring decisions each turn, very little player interaction and a lot of pre-planning seemed to me to be just plain boring.  And the theme - who would want to be a medieval farmer?  Lots of excitement there!!!?????  Bottom line - worst game that I have played in a long time.  Too bad because I wanted to really like this game.

Splendid little game.  It's great to play even with non-gamer friends, as everyone can have a blast building up their little farm and family, such that even 'losing' still feels rewarding and satisfying.  For the more serious gamer, there is also a lot of meaningful decisions, strategy, and flexibility required to come out on top in this one. All in all a wonderful game that can appeal to everyone playing, regardless of their level of 'gamer geek'

This has been the game that was played on 90% of our weekly gaming nights in 2009. We mostly play 3p and 4p games, with the occasional 5p thrown in.We haven't played a game this much since Settlers with the Cities and Knights expansion about 8 to 9 years ago.

Personal low: mummblemmmummumblemm

To succeed, players must develop synergies between his/her occupations, improvements, and worker placements. 

I prefer this to Caverna, which is odd, considering I tend to prefer perfect-information games. 

However, what occupations and improvements a player drafts or with which they randomly starts creates a puzzle: how does the player optimally coordinate these cards with his or her worker placements? This puzzle varies from game to game, and increases Agricola's appeal.

It's games like this that keep me buying new ones. An endless quest for a repeat of that sensation experienced during the exciting discovery of a new elegant game that I want to play over and over. After my first play, I chalked this one up as a nicely designed worker placement. But after a few more games I found that the variability in card driven strategy begs for more plays and attempts at improved optimization. That said, I find that games with 4 or more players can drag esp with those prone to AP. I like it best with two or three. All in all a fantastic game that has broad appeal for a relatively deep game. The hype is justified.

This game basically ticks all my boxes:
Sexy theme (farming in 19th century Germany)
Exciting things to do (fishing, plowing fields, tending cattle, building a stove, baking bread)
Great mechanics (that have you scrambling to build an engine just to have the game end right when the mad hustle is slowing down and you finally feel a shred of control.)
The single most amazing thing about this game though, is that your meeples can BREED. I've always felt there is way too little sexual content in your average worker placement game. After all, what could be more natural than a little wood on wood action?

This is very far off track. Sorry.

Agricola is a fine game. Well loved. Not a perfect fit for me but I'm usually happy to play it. (If I have too.)

It has a similar feeling to age of steam, the feeling of almost drowning in debt for the first 3/4 of the game, and then, once you manage to get a sustainable food source, you can focus on the luxury of expanding your farm.  Lots to do, quite evocative, a lot to admire.  More special power cards than I generally like, but I like the way your options slowly expand over the course of a game, allowing you time to get used to all the possibilities.  I feel like I'm bargain hunting, coupon-clipping.  My girlfriend played it and liked it.  She says, "I didn't know guys play games about shopping!"

UPDATE: After 10 or so plays, the game is still holding my interest.  In the general sense, this isn't my type of game.  There's too much text, too many bits.  The game requires not a jot of creative play (only efficient play), and there's very little interaction between players.  But what Agricola does it does really well.  Its appeal is broad, even to non-gamers, making it easy to get on the table.  I'm always happy to play, and I'm always proud to see what gets accomplished on my little piece of land.

Agricola is a lot of fun, till it comes time to scoring.

I'm not usually too focused on winning (save for in "take that" games where it's funny to throw hurdles at others), but I feel extra detached from winning playing Agricola -- the scoring feels arbitrary. (I like how I built my farm, where do you get off saying it sucks, game designer?)

The process of designing and expanding my farm while keeping my family fed is enough for me to have fun, though.

It really is just that good. Ranks up there with Antiquity and roads and boats, but less deep than those two. Le Havre is the deeper Agricola if that is what you are looking for.

RATING: 8
update after 50+ plays - i still really enjoy it but the start player thing is becoming more and more annoying esp with 4/5 ppl - the person 2 the left of the most keen just benefits too much


rating after 1 play - 6/7

concerns: not 'tight' enuff compared to say le havre, too many cards in hand, vps at end is fiddly and inelegant

also a self-congratulatory wank-fest ala race for the galaxy

rating after 8plays (3/4pls) - 7/8 

k so i like the constant tension of wanting to do so many things BUT i still think the end scoring is fiddly and inelegant and u can still get screwed by your start hand. 

i think itd be a better game with less random and more communal cards...oh hold on ...that LE HAVRE :) (shame that one takes a fair bit longer)

rating after 11 plays - 8 - i like it more the more i play it

rating after 20 plays - 8 - a good solid 8 and prob won't change

rating after 50 plays - 9 - lots to like about it tho can get screwed by ur cards, also i no longer recommend it with 5 - start player becomes too crucial and u can be stiched up big time but other player's sub-optimal play

RECC - le havre 

WEIGHT:
rules - 2/3 - is fiddly but the tight theming helps - tho forget the cards for noobies
play - 3 - 
master - 3/4 - hard to master but random cards add to this
= 9/3 = 3

RATING: 5
While the base (family) game is decent enough, the "real" game is a disappointment. Too many randomness from the additional cards, which are pretty imbalanced. Too many possibilities with too many limitations to use them. In this game you just can't develop a certain strategy, you MUST do a bit of everything. I would have scored it much lower, but the family game variation, which is not even considered a game by the "real players" helps it.

There is a lot of people out there that love this game. Of all the "worker placement" games I own, this one is the least fun. The pieces are annoying, the boards are annoying and clunky at best. They may have worked better as one big board. There are so many pieces that need sub-divided based on the number of people playing. As a two player game, I find it weak and boring. I just don't understand all the hubbub over this game. Not to mention, it leaves the feeling that you want to do more and you can't. Lame.

RATING: 9.6
While I bought this game to play with my gamer friends, I knew it had elements my wife would enjoy- namely efficiently building and planning a farm. She enjoys games like Vegas Showdown and Princes of Florence where you have a plot of land and buy elements to build on that plot. Knowing her aversion to complex games, I thought I'd introduce her to the Family game version and see what happened. Immediately afterwords, she demanded to play the full version. After a full game of Agricola she demanded a rematch and now wants to play again. This game is a winner.

The game starts off slowly, but starts to fly by. For a longer game, it seems like it just isn't long enough to do what you want. Very low downtime, constant agonizing decisions, and huge replay value. Every game seems to have a panic zone of seeing the game barreling to the end with a lot of empty farm spaces not enough actions to do what you want.

RATING: 6
While the game has various subsystems, the all-consuming need for food bends most of them to a common goal.  Due to the scoring, one can't push to far out one system to the exclusion of others forcing a balanced growth in many areas. 

A game that will take a few plays to wrap one's head around as the choices from the cards aren't always obvious without having a feel for the full arc of the game.

Definitely need to be the right mood to play this one, not one I am rushing to suggest all the time nor seeking to play more than a few times a year.  Rating lowered as a result, especially after playing Caverna and wondering if I slight prefer Caverna just a tad more.

Does a good job of handling the "worker" placement genre--giving tough choices to every player through out the game.  Scales well for differing numbers of players through use of the different action cards.  A wide variety of minor improvements and occupations keeps the game from becoming stale.

A well done game on all levels.  The only negative is the possibility that a killer combo of minor improvements/occupations could lead to victory over skillful play.

Rating will probably go up with more play.  Very multi-player solitaire.  Many, MANY options to consider on each turn.  Very, VERY few actions each turn.  Strategies seemed to take a fair amount of time to develop and seemed fairly fragile, i.e. one missed action (another player semi-randomly chose what you happened to need) could be VERY damaging.  Might have a few too many moving parts...or might be a tremendous game for years to come.  Want to try again, especially with fewer players, which I think might work better.

UPDATE: I'm definitely keen to try with fewer players, which should help a bit with the fragility mentioned above.  Rating up a bit.

UPDATE: Rating bumped up for the two-player game, which I found easier to manage and more fun.

 Replayed drafting the cards at the start, gets much better and allows more long term planning.
-----------------
 A little overrated for my taste. Scoring system leads to a strange endgame where people simply tries to pick up the optimum action, without any strategy concerns, thats because the difference between having zero or one items of each class is huge in points. Also, cards seem too imbalanced. But a fun game anyway, with good replayability.

I think this is a great designed game. But after I played Caverna and glass road this game when down to a 6 for me on rating. The only reason why it is rated a 6 and not higher is because Caverna and glass road each by themselves gives me the same and maybe more then what I get from playing Agricola. Since these games I have not been back to play this game. But other than that this is a great game still for other people.

I figured it out what I don't like about this game: The goal is too dispersed for me; no empty spots and as much variance as possible with the few resources you have. I need to work towards some kind of goal; like a defendable dungeon in Dungeon Lords or (I hope) the best beers in Brew crafters. Some games I play are a bit scattered goalwise speaking, like Pillars of the Earth and Dungeon Petz, but at least in those games you can choose your own goals or ways to go forward. In Agricola not so much; Agricola crossed the fine line of not enough focus combined with too many must-do's and too little resources

I predicted this would become my family's favorite game, surpassing "Settlers of Catan."  I was wrong.  The family enjoys it, but not as much as SoC, for a few reasons:
(1) At 1.5 hours, it's a half-hour longer.
(2) It is less social.  The only possible interaction is one that "hurts" another player.
(3) It makes us think more.
None of these are bad; they're just different.  For a family that enjoys "Harvest Moon," it's a terrific theme.

3. I-deck: Field Watchman(64)-Bricklayer(72)-Fence Builder(63)-Clay Hut Builder(66)-Wood Collector(74)-Net Fisherman(72)-Church Warden(75)
4. E/I/K/Z-deck: Chief(58)-Carpenter(65)-Master Brewer(67)-Merchant(70)-Schnaps Distiller(67)-Fence Overseer(77)-Sower(77)
5. E/I/K/Z-deck: Woodcutter(55)-Forester(64)-Clay Mixer(65)-Animal Tamer(66)-Plow Maker(72)-Chief(74)-Pieceworker(75)
6. E/K-deck: Merchant(52)-Adoptive Parents(72)-Master Brewer(60)-Lord of the Manor(64)-Carpenter(69)-Baker(76)-Market Woman(72)
7. Gamer's-deck: Family Counselor(56)-Seed Master(60)-Food Critic(69)-Architect(66)-Inventor(72)-Grafter(75)-Grain Farmer(73)
8. Belgium-deck: Surrealist(50)-Rainmaker(66)-Anatomist(68)-Soda Producer(71)-Small Scale Farmer(73)-Elder(80)-Seed Scatterer(80)

Quarry is *very* powerful in later rounds of series...
Gamer's deck doesn't have many ways to get extra resources (at least, not in a solo game).  I think the Inventor was therefore the most powerful of the occupations.

Every turn you have to make tough choices because turns are very limited and your opponents will limit your choices. After every game I always feel I could have done better.

We like this game, but it is just so frustrating.  So much anxiety about feeding your family!  So much conflict over taking the best worker placement spots!  We never played it enough to get deep into the strategy of using all the different people and improvements, so maybe we didn't give this game its fair chance.  But we just never liked it enough to pull it out and play it more.  Just too tight and anxiety-ridden.  Not my kind of game.  I like interesting, difficult decisions, but I don't like how painful this game is.  We traded it away for Legendary Encounters: Alien.

06-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. I refrained playing Agricola after seeing all the components and the -to me- unclear reading of the rules. I had it taught to me by an experienced Agricola player (Thanks Flashly).

In the end, I think the game is quite easy to comprehend. Basically it's a worker placement game with actions that come available during play in a semi-random order. The theme, farming I couldn't care less about, but the theme is  well executed and cards/actions make sense both gameplay wise and thematically. A well executed game and a fun challenge to play. Way better than I expected beforehand, being more thematically game minded.

The only thing that is very un-thematic is the scoring. You can not develop paths in the way you want, but are steered by the scoring (you get punished if you fail to do something), and are not allowed to focus on something you like to do or your cards suggest.

Get ready to compete for resources! Should you send your family members out to gather wood, clay, reeds or stone? Should you add people or improvements to your farm who give you a bonus whenever you or another player perform an action? Don't forget the animals. You have to get some sheep, wild boar and cattle and fence them in as soon as possible so you have something to feed those babies! The number of players (1-5) will dictate which resources and how many of each resource are available in the game. Couple that with a new combination of 14 cards per player each game and you will have a different experience each time you take it out of the box. Lots of choices and lots of paths to victory will keep you coming back for more, This game has been at the top of BGG for a long time for a reason.

After my first "real game" of this I must say that I see why the game is so loved. It's clear that there is a ton of strategy and a ton of re-playability. Each game getting a different hand of minor improvements and occupations just gives the game unheard of amounts of strategy.

Hands down still the best true Euro worker placement game in my opinion.  Euroy-goodness but with a theme that doesn't feel tacked on. Easy point of entry with the family game, even for kids, and scales up in difficulty, introducing just minor improvements, then occupations, and then drafting both for veteran players, with many decks available.

Pretty deep strategy game around the idea of building a 15th century farm. There are many possible actions and many ways to win, but you can only do a limited number of actions each turn and if another player takes that action for the turn, you can't do it, so you need a plan but you need to be ready to adapt it.

Disclaimer:  I've only ever played Agricola as a 2 player game, so this is where my opinion is coming from.  With that being said, I could easily see how more players could change some of my gripes (such as the wood/family expansion unbalance).

At first, I loved Agricola... I had never played a game with so many options.  I also loved the replayability given by the cards.

But now that I've played over 30 games, I can say that I'm put-off by the food engine.  Even though the some of the occupation/improvement cards add SOME replayability to the game (not much replayability because most cards are useless due to their low ROI), I feel the food engine can only be set up a few different ways... and I don't like repetition or strategic constraints.  I also don't like how I am forced to spend 80% of the game setting up a food engine so I can spend the last 20% focusing on building my farm; I'd say about 70% of your total VP come in the last 3 rounds... and this backloading makes the first 11 rounds feel like a chore.  It's frustrating that you spend most of the game taking care of the food requirements rather than actually playing the game to gain victory points.  

And like I said, while the cards add SOME replayability, the food engines are pretty much always the same:  are you going to be a baker, a gardener, a slaughterer, will you frequent the fishing/day laborer spots, or will you use a hybird approach with some card bonuses and one of the above mentioned techniques?  Not much going on there.. and since the food engine is the core of the game, the replayability takes a major hit.

And finally, the most overpowered and obvious path to victory is to hog the wood space and increase your family as quickly as possible.  This sucks the fun out of the game because the person controlling the wood can limit the other's growth, thus securing a strong foothold on the lead.  I could see this changing in a game of more than 2 players, though.

This game is one of my favorite so far. It is a heavy duty thinker. The only element of luck in this game are the cards you draw which introduces a slight element of luck but not enough to change the game drastically.  Unfortunately I always lose this game but I still love it. It might be seeing my farm develop and strategically building your farm better than everyone else's farm. Some people hate the feeding people requirment aspect of this game but to me I like the challenge it gives to the game.

Pros: Very Strategic game, a lot of player options, competitive game, Extremely thematic, Changing game play every game, Variety of options, Challenging

Cons: Long playing time, difficult to teach, Long set up time, Prone to stalls with indecisive players.

Only played once so far, but my initial impression was pretty good. I think you are going to need a good number of plays under your belt to really appreciate the game. I can't imagine playing with more than the E deck to start with. Getting to know what cards are available seems like a must to really play the game well.

An excellent euro that is deserving of all the accolades it receives. Le Havre may be deeper, but Agricola is more enjoyable, most likely because it's missing that "digging yourself out of a hole" feeling and less resources to keep track of.

I see a lot of replay value here, and there seem to be plenty of paths to victory. The starting hand available to each player will suggest certain strategies, but there are a variety of ways to maximize VPs in any way a player chooses.

Another thing I like about this game is the artwork and resource meeples. With the goodies expansion it becomes incredibly immersive. Much like Le Havre the print on the cards is small, but unlike Le Havre you don't have to squint across the table at other player's play areas to read them.

The learning curve is steep, but I haven't played a Rosenberg game where that isn't the case. I'm disappointed I listened to the naysayers for so long, and I'm glad I finally discovered for myself how great Agricola truly is.

RATING: 9
With the "choose a role" dynamic, it's like Puerto Rico, but with more of a story arc. Though by the end of the game you're choosing between roughly 25 different actions, it somehow doesn't feel overwhelming. More so than any other game I've played, a good performance requires balanced strategy. The crux of the game is more about planning the fastest and most efficient path towards the (relatively) same endgame that your opponents are aiming for.

Though it is difficult for new players to correctly value the improvements and occupations, but that just adds depth for the advanced player. Overwhelming for euro game newbies, but straightforward rules for those comfortable simultaneously keeping an eye on a handful of success metrics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game looks fairly simple from the outset, but there is a lot of strategy involved here.  Even in the base game you have to really plan ahead if you want to win.  Adding in the cards gives the game a lot more variety and replayability, and complexity as well.  I haven't even used the intermediate and advanced cards yet...  Easy game to play without having to understand a ton of rules.  I usually advise new players to have fun with it and build whatever farm they like!  After playing it once it becomes apparent to all players how you should 'best' play.  Recommended for board game groups who don't want to play anything crazy complex, but more in depth than Catan.

Sigh... it's fantastic.  I tried so hard not to buy into the hype, but I can't deny it.  To me, Agricola has it all: Strategy, replayability, cool theme, etc.

You need to do so many things in so little time.  Thanks to the amount and uniqueness of the cards, each game is different.

I never turn down an offer to play.

RATING: 7.7
--Dec2007-- Very fine game, in my opinion.  The game has modest duration with lots of lovely little decision points, and buckets of variability.  In some ways, it's "Caylus done right": I've never wanted to play another game of Caylus immediately after finishing one; the idea of another shot at the Agricola puzzle, on the other hand, was completely compelling.  Many thanks to Ted for teaching.
--Aug2008-- My (English,Z-Man) copy arrived on the 6th. Whee!
--Sept2008-- Perhaps surprisingly, both of my older children (13m, 8f) find the game fascinating.  One might uncharitably suggest that the young one likes the game for the lovely little animeeples, but that doesn't explain why she keeps winning!

This is quite the game.  I'm not surprised it's gotten all the hype.   As for my personal take;

I enjoy the combination of Economics / Worker placement that Agricola has to offer, and I really look forward to digging deeper into the game to really try on more informed strategies.  I don't however think this is the best game of 2008.  

Gamers that love games where you can exert a massive amount of control over outcomes will enjoy playing this if they get a good mix of cards in their hand.  I found this to be the one major weakness with the one game I played.  While I admit that I misplayed many of the cards I had (chalk that up to fist time played) I was able to look back and see I did indeed have one of the least powerful hands.  With the fluctuation of the cards, I feel like you should have to draft for at least half the cards in your starting hand....   not only would that make the game more interesting (you'd know who picked up that hamper...) it would also make bad hands not amount to a crap game for one or two players.

Love: Everything. Wish 2-player could have the full experience of the 3+ and 4+ cards. Cards provide new combinations and possibilities each game, challenging trade-offs, Klemens Franz art, animeeples. We play with the semi-official 2-player fix and usually mix France deck cards with I or E.

Expansions owned: France Deck, CZ Deck, Legen-dairy Deck, Farmers of the Moor (but it's in French so we don't play it often)

Előre le kell szögeznem, hogy alapvetően a játék helyezése és elismertsége miatt szereztem be alapvetően. A téma különösebben nem vonz, ennek ellenére sokat vártam a játéktól.
Értem és megértem a körülötte levő nagy hype-ot, de mindent összevetve nem tudom maradéktalanul elfogadni az igen előkelő 2. helyezését.
Lehetne benne talán valamivel több konfrontációs lehetőség. Kissé talán a játékidő is hosszú, bár némi rutinnal azért ez a tűrhetőn belül marad. (Meg mondjuk előnye az is, hogy jól lehet mellette dumálni, nem kell végig koncentráltan figyelni.) A szabályfüzet az maga a borzalom! Szokásos módon autodidakta módon tanultam a játékmenetet, de jó pár munkaórát igénybe vett mindez + a netes videók segítségét is igénybe kellett vennem. A szabály kuszasága azért is problémás, mert később is nehezen kereshető a válasz 1-1 felmerült kérdésre...
Fura volt pl. a Caylus-szal szemben, hogy nincs az az eszeveszett nagy erőforrás hiány, ami miatt "beszorul" az ember. Egyszerűen olyan sok a lehetőség, a választható akciók annyi esélyt kínálnak, hogy a bőség zavarával küzd az ember. (Különösen problémás ez, ha egy kezdő ül le játszani).
Ugyanakkor igazán jó és üdvözlendő döntés, hogy magyarul is megjelent. Még egyszer: teljesen érthető a játék népszerűsége (amit elsősorban a témájának tudok be).
Nekem gémer játéknak nem volt igazán mély/átélhető, családi játéknak meg éppen, hogy túl bonyolultnak ill. túl hosszúnak érzem. Valamint a mellett se mennék el említés nélkül, hogy "mechanikailag" semmi újat nem mutat.

I am on the fence on this one.  It has some cool things going on.  Every game is very different.  It has a decent amount of interaction, and the bits are nice.  

The end game just feels so horribly un-epic and uninspired for how long the game can run. 


EDIT: No longer on the fence.  It's pretty simple - I dont have much fun when i play this game.

I love worker placement games and after having played quite a few - I think "the Gric" is the best among them. It is also very tense due to the food shortage and quite competitive. IMO 2-player and 4-player are the best scenarios.

You play a mid-century rancher, running your own farm by sowing, ranching and family growth. It's a perfect Deutsch Boardgame, offering many paths for each player to choose, although family growth is the key of all, you should still make your own plan about feeding, buying and point-scoring. Hundreds of Minor Developments and Occupations make the game different every time you play it. Considering that some cards are enormously more powerful than others, the card-drafting may become a drawback against the game balance. But you can still remove some of the Breaking ones. I like this game very much.

RATING: 6
[color=#CC0000]

The peak of the strongly-controlled, highly-quantified, carefully-channeled breed of board games.  I'll be surprised to see one go significantly bigger or more complex than this.

This is a game where much of your destiny is kept under the thumbs of other players, while your thumb is firmly placed on top of theirs.  In Agricola there are a broad enough array of options that you don't feel as claustrophobic as you do in others of this genre, and I give it credit for that, at least on the easier decks.

Fundamentally though, Worker Placement titles such as this are disempowering and don't appeal to me because I feel that I'm taking actions to knock others, largely because there's nowhere left that would be beneficial for myself.  Positive options not available, I finish my move getting in someone else's way and have to take contentment in the concept of slowing others down as a form of advancing myself.

That's just not satisfying gaming for me.  I won't turn down the game if it's offered, but I would much prefer other games when craving a similar level of complexity.  Even something as esoteric as WoW: DoWWII with the full altitude rules is more satisfying.  It's as complex and intense as Agricola, but your decisions are fundamentally your own to do with as you please.  You're not stuck in a "choose the best of the junk that's left" situation.  Dozens of other examples to choose from.

That's likely not going to be a well-respected opinion here on BGG, but that's the heart of my concept of interesting game play.  A game where the majority of your time is spent blocking others is not compelling for me.  Alas, it's currently the darling of the industry, so I'm largely left playing older titles.

Very much worth the hype. Might be even worth nine after a few plays. So far played only one five player game but even though the game seems quite daunting and complex at first it is quite logical and easy to pick up. To me it seems the cards might give too much advantage in the advanced game. On the other hand in the game we played the winner had only one useful card - I had none :-) 
After second game raised the rating to 9. It's a tight game where you easily end up doing things not optimally. This hasn't at least yet resulted in too much analysis paralysis in our group. Lookin forward playing again.

1.22.14:  After buying & playing Caverna, Agricola is downgraded for me.  Personally I'm happy to play either one, but, frankly Caverna is easier to teach/play and therefore has a higher chance of success with new players, and in my world, there are almost always new players.

8.5.13: Gric has grown on me tremendously, I do love it and will play as often as I can.  I think the feel is significantly enhanced by pimping it out with either The Goodies expansion or FIMO bits.

I like the fact that there are different levels of complexity. I have introduced both my mother and girlfriend to the family version, and both got into it. I am already getting a little tired of the simpler game, but I like the fact that it is possible to introduce a new player with the slimmed down rules to make entry into the full game easier. The theme might seem a bit surreal at first for a wargamer like me (build up a farm? I'd rather storm through Eastern Europe thank you very much!), but the actions and the cards really did remind me of what I had read about the development of farming when I had to study Social and Economic History at BA level; therefore, I did feel it was a genuine kind of historical simulation. Moreover, I felt the mechanics fit the theme well. A further plus point is the fact that you can play solo.

I really do enjoy this game. It scaffolds perfectly, allowing a relatively new group of people to board gaming to come in at a level that isn't intimidating, and builds up rule by rule until you have mastery. I play this regularly with my family (non-gamers) at our local Starbucks and happily field questions from passerby. It looks gorgeous, and plays great.

I would suggest working through the deck though. Some card combinations are downright too good, and a handful of the occupations are particularly strong. I would suggest removing them from the deck (like we did) or drafting hands (like we do).

Its a really fun game as long as the people you play it with have a little patience... And you need to realize you can't do everything or you will get really stressed.

I was so put off by the art of this game that it took me a LONG time to get around to looking into the mechanisms of it. After years of resistance I caved and I discovered that the art really does grow on you and the game more than makes up for it, even if you still hate the art. This game is tight and relentless. It deserves the praise and classic status.

Finally having tried the Komplex deck, it is my favorite. The benefits come but require a bit more, like two occupations, rather than getting them almost right off the bat in Easy. Interactions deck is just too messy to enjoy, but maybe I need to try that one again too (may have only played once).

I've never been waterboarded but I imagine the experience is comparable to Agricola.

The process of partaking in this game was so prolonged I was convinced the clock was going backwards.

It later turned out that due to daylight savings the clock had gone backwards, but the point still stands due to my growing fear that I was stuck in a sort of time loop of which I couldn't escape, and I would be stuck in a purgatory in which I would be forever damned to play Agricola.

I think the earliest clue that the game was not for me was whilst reading the instructions I got a call from family informing me that my Grandparents had died in some freak accident on their farm in the valley.

I bring this review to you from the funeral service. I actually thing I'm having more fun here.

I've played this so much, it's insane. Juicy decisions, solid setting, and a look that I like. The cards are one of the best design elements ever made in a game of this type. It ensures that the game will be different every time. There is an absurd sense of satisfaction at the end of the game when you look at your farm, even if you lost badly. 

I'm somewhere about 50 plays, and the decisions are still challenging for me, the gameplay is still rewarding, and the card combos are still fun to find. It's never gotten obvious, and I think it'll stay with me for years to come.

This game may feel cruel to newcomers, and still feels like a "serious" euro game to the experienced.  It's very satisfying once you get things up and running; I love the spatial element in which you actually lay out your farm on your board, rather than having it all abstracted.

I have mixed feelings about being dealt the cards at the start of the game and having to build your strategy around them (I haven't yet tried drafting the cards), but they definitely add a lot of replayability.

It's hard to say whether I prefer this over Caverna.  Caverna feels much more open, while the cards in Agricola make it seem deeper.  Both have their strengths, and I think they are just different enough not to step on each other's toes.

I WANT to love this game.  I really do.  The mechanics are great, but it's maybe too thematic.  I actually feel the stress of a starving farmer while playing this.  Unfortunately I just can't get over that stress and simply enjoy losing.  I'm sure if I played it more, the game would get easier to wrap my mind around all that needs to be done, but I'm not sure I want to invest that kind of time.  I already have a job.

I bought it when it came out, based on the hype, and was sadly disappointed. 

My biggest issue is that it feels like you're constantly losing and fighting the game itself every step of the way. You never have enough time to do anywhere near everything you want, and the clock keeps getting more and more aggressive. The winner is the person who manages to lose the least, and it really sucks all the fun out of the exercise.

Furthermore, I think it takes way too long for the sort of game it is.  If I'm going to spend over three hours on a game, I want to have conquered some empires or raised a civilization or something meaningful, as opposed to barely avoiding starvation while scratching a living out of the dirt. In that respect, I guess, it's actually a pretty good simulation of the soul-crushing daily grind of being a peasant during the dark ages.

I love Uwe's masterpeiece and the only games so far shadowing this is Eclipse, but that's just another story. Agricola stays the model for a eurogame and it will be a while before anyone will match this.

I dislike the xtensions but this does not make the gajme less fun and interesting to play.

Un gioco bellissimo!

Enjoyed my first play (3 player) although felt the cards had too large an influence on the final standings. Will definitely play again and would like to do so with more players.

Of course several plays later show me that knowledge of the cards improves the game greatly.

I like this game, but it's overrated.  During the last turn, it frequently occurs that there is no useful placement of a family member, which should never happen in a worker placement game.  Moreover, with more than three players it just drags on too much (even three's a bit of a stretch).

Brought after playing a friends copy, hit the table 3 times over the course of a year. Each time never replicating the same lure and appeal that the first play did. Passed on.

Durva worker-placement játék, ahol mindig 2, de inkább 3 további akcióra lenne szükséged, mint amennyi van. Ráadásul a végén, ha kihegyezted a farmodat valamire, a többi tevékenység hanyagolásáért büntetőpont jár. Az eddigi játékok során úgy sem sikerült 1-nél több új munkást szereznem, hogy csak ketten játszottunk, míg az internet tele van 4-5 emberes partik fotóival, ahol szinte mindenki 4 családtaggal nyomul... nem jöttem még rá a helyes csapásirányra na!

This game is pretty dang fun. Everyone having their own farm is pretty neat, and the resources are tight.

The cards are certainly what make the game, as they take worker/resource management and a bit of CCG to the game.

My only gripes are length (2 or so hours tends to be a bit much for me) and space (hard to fit everything on the table).

RATING: 4
An advanced worker placement game with a lot going on...

Every player gets his personal board to build a farm on. To take actions you have to place your workers on a free common space in the middle. Take Ressources, take actions to build houses, stables, ovens, grow food, get new workers...

Although many people consider this a great game, I am not one of them. I payed it several times but just do not enjoy it. One reason is the lack of player interaction which is non-existing (you can as well play this solo without losing anything...).
The other factor is the limited options on how to play the game - I have to explain this, right? Although you get a ton of options (often to much to get moving) and each player gets 14 different cards each game (the best part of it all) you will always have the same story told. This is partially due to the scoring mechanisms at the end which forces you to do everything to be effective -> the result: your options and strategies do not matter and every farm looks alike at the end. This sounds a bit harsh but it really kills the game for me.
My summary: Other games do it better; this is NOT for me but many do enjoy it...

Fun game with a real sense of satisfaction at the end as you look down at your (hopefully) thriving farm. The game-play is really enjoyable, and I will agree the game deserves a high ranking, but, I can see a few things I don't like about it. 

Played competitively some cards (or, more often, combos of cards) basically gift a player a victory, and it's difficult to block cards from being played as you've no idea what's out there. The game is unforgiving, too, with players who fall behind unable to catch up (especially in the family-growth stakes) as actions allow further actions and the game's ever increasing pace means if you've not got a food engine up by the mid-game you're probably in trouble, and then have to sit through half-a-game struggling whilst others get their stone houses and nice tools. 

Hence, the game suffers when you play it with inexperienced or unskilled players as you're romping home to victory, whilst they can't see how to get things sorted. 

Physically, the game's beyond reproach: The components are both of sufficient quality and (very) plentiful, and the art is nice.

Tremendous game. A lot of Euros do not have much theme. But by the end of this game you will feel you have built a farm. Excellent replay value with the many different cards offering lots of various strategies. Very little luck and requires a lot of critical thinking, tactics, and strategy. It has a permanent spot in my collection and I evaluate all new purchases of similar games by this one to see if they are worth getting.

The classic! When I first bought it I was excited enough that I played 15 solo games, in preparation for playing with other people. It took me a long time before I matched that total in multiplayer games.

Love the crushing despair, that's what I'm here for. Well, that and the card combo-ing.

I never liked the individual hand of cards, though. Too long, too solitary, too much being able to crush with lucky card combos. My current preference is to lay out a 14 card communal hand of 7 occupations and 7 minor improvements. All are played as if they were in hand, replaced at end of turn...with this option, Caverna becomes redundant. This has the advantage also of being easier to teach, as all cards are visible to be talked about.

It has a whole lot more messing with other people, though, which is hard for some. I think more interaction is almost always good, myself.

Worst game of our time. "Farming" in a vacuum. Dying for a good Kansas cyclone to sweep it all away. 

In other words, my memory of playing this game makes me want to barf. 

(To quote user offwater on the game Vinhos: "You mined tin in Cornwall, painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, so why not produce wine in Portuguese vineyards now?!
Because, to be honest, it is about the 1001st heavily structured euro with a boring pasted-on theme rammed down our throats that offers the same old clichéd cube-pushing yawn-fest for 4 hours (including a 1-hour rules explanation) as its predecessors.
Another nail in the coffin of the eurogame genre...")

A great improvement on Caylus, and the family game is sufficiently interesting that you don't need to add the cards. The main negative -- and it's a big one -- is the setup time, which is quite lengthy.

One of the most overrated games in the whole BGG, in my opinion: once you have the rules down, and some plays under your belt, it appears clear how there's only one strategy to win: the more your family grows, the more actions you have, the easier is to score a victory. Hence, games are developed in the very same way, doing more or less the same actions over and over and over. Additionally, there's a huge load of cards, but they actually enter play very rarely and very few at a time, giving the idea of a huge potential completely wasted.

Fortunately some of this is fixed by Farmers of the Moor, but really, not a game we play that much any longer.

My favorite worker placement game and one the first difficult games I played. It sometimes feels like Uwe Rosenberg is chasing the success of Agricola and his successive worker placement games (such as Caverna and Feast for Odin) feel messier and not quite as fun or satisfying to do well at. There's something to say for a game that challenges the player and lets them fail. Caverna and Odin are friendlier games, and in my opinion are worse for it.

Hat jedes Quäntchen Hype verdient. Obwohl Thema und Mechanik zunächst nach wenig anmuten, macht Agricola jedes Mal einen Heidenspaß. Das liegt einerseits daran, dass das Prinzip "Viele Möglichkeit, nur wenige Aktionen" zu sehr schwierigen Entscheidungen führt – "Nehme ich mir schonmal das Schilf oder pflüge ich doch erst mal den dringend notwendigen Acker?" –, andererseits auch an den in enormer Zahl vorhandenen Beschäftigungs- und Anschaffungskarten, die für viel Abwechslung sorgen.

Punktabzug gibt es allerdings für das Punktezählsystem, dessen Sinn sich mir noch immer nicht erschließt. Jede Farm verkommt in den letzten Spielrunden zum Einheitsbrei, weil ja alles zumindest in geringer Anzahl vorhanden sein muss.

Discovered it very late, as I was sure I would not like it because of the theme and supposedly little interaction. Little did I expect that it would become one of the games I hold in highest esteem. It's intense, requires both careful planning of your own actions and foretelling what other players are likely to do, and the results are usually - between people with similar skill - very close and reapetable. The only things I don't like about it is lack of Caylus-style order and a small luck factor of good card draw, but at least the latter can be mitigated by a draft.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I never really get why so many people are down on farming as a theme - did they not have toy tractors and an assortment of plastic animals in different scales as a kid? Playing with little wooden sheep and cows appeals to something on a very fundamental level. With the different modes of play (which can cover the range from light, family fun to an intense strategic & tactical challenge) and the vast number of optional decks of cards, there is a ridiculous amount of game in this box. 

At somewhere over a hundred plays, I'm not by any means burned out on the game, but enjoy it as an occasional indulgence rather than a weekly entertainment. That's a decent amount of play for one game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An amazing design -- taking the best of Caylus & Puerto Rico, plus an enormous selection of cards that ensures no single set of tactics will "solve" the game.

Much better than both mentioned games -- if that means it is ranked #1, so be it.  

Scales great, but seems to require a trial game for newbies to really get the hang of it.

It is very clear why this game has won so many awards. From the great concept, to the tenseness of trying to have enough food for the harvest, to the replayability and the starting variability... there's just so much that Agricola does well. The only minor issue with the base game that I have is the lack of incentive to build fences or renovate early, but fortunately, the Farmers of the Moor expansion solves that nicely.

RATING: 9
Good options. All players are encouraged through the scoring to compete for all types of goods and actions. This means there's much more player interaction than I thought there would be. It seems the trick is to not compete at the same stage of the game - difficult as cards only come out at set stages. Fantastic replay value with the cards, but scoring goals are always the same and let it down slightly.

The scoring system is complicated and unintuitive, not like in [i]Caylus[/i], and the luck of the draw could be a factor that brings unbalance to the game.

When first read, the game appears to be a Caylus knock-off, particuarly given the worker placement.  After playing, however, the game feels quite different.  The Occupation & Improvement cards change strategy from game to game as players customize their farm to maximize their card utilization.  Whereas Caylus relies more on variablity in player strategy, this game relies on card management.  The balance of farm growth versus using the farm to feed your family is what creates the most tension, and this mechanic is a welcome addition to any game.

The solo version is also excellent, and bests Arkham Horror in terms of truly feeling like a puzzle, rather than an excercise in dice rolling.

One of my favorites, but I don't get to play it too often because my wife dislikes it.  

Update:  We had previously only played the "family" version together.  Once we started playing the full version with occupation cards and minor improvements, she loves it and asks to play!

Update 4/12 - My absolute favorite game.  
Upate 4/13 - has been replaced by Keyflower as my favorite, but I still enjoy this one.
Update 4/14 - omg, down to a 9.5  I don't play it enough and other games are crowding out my excitement to play.  Still really enjoy it, but I might be reaching for Caverna next time I want to play...Time will tell...

Finally got around to owning and playing this. I picked up the animeeples (which were a nice touch) and now I want the fancy resource tokens as well. My wife and I have limited our play to the family rules so far, and I'm sure this is a large part of my rather lackluster rating (relative to the average). It's a good game, but it isn't a forgiving game and that means that we have to be in a particular mood to play it.

This is the LAST time I cave in to BGG hype!  My rating might go up over time after I "get it" but after a number of plays I'm not impressed.  I'm really starting to hate this trend of games with little to no direct player interaction.  After playing this, I crave games like Age of Steam or Steam with auctioning so I can feel like I earned a hard fought win.  I could care less if I win this game.  I need a tornado card to take out one of your pig pens.  I need to be worried that you might get a thief occupation card that allows you to steal some of my stuff.  How about an earthquake card the levels part of everybody's houses?  What I get here is a cute, little, pastel play mat, to build my farm on, and if I'm lucky my opponents will take an action I need.  On the other hand, this feels like a nice activity to kill some time with my wife while building a point generating engine with vegetables and animals.

Although I do agree with the people that say people can get really lucky with the cards and start with an advantage, it doesn't bother me.

I really enjoy playing this game.  It's enjoyable to me because it can feel like you are getting screwed on the scoring, and in the end you have a well-scoring farm with a great deal of variety.

Picked up second hand in like new condition from gamer on Craigslist in VA. Finally got my first play in.  What an awesome game.  Very simple game play with the worker placement and finite cards you will have access to.  But tons to keep track of.  I love the low scoring with balancing where you score points versus where you will lose points. Can't wait to play this one again and will prob look to add the Goodies expansion and the new minis for the game.

In Family mode, it's a puzzle game with a little bit of interaction due to blocking etc. The occupations and minor improvements make it a brain burner to figure out how to mix and match them. Fun either way, but more to be desired.

Ok it is worth noting that my play time with this game is very LIGHT (all using E deck) but I am totally addicted to it already!!!  The first game was 5 player and 4 of us were new... it is a very complex game so it was slow going at first.  We have since played several games using two players each (for a 4 player game)and I can say that each game has been unique.  With 3 more decks we haven't even tried there are lots of things to learn.  The strengths are that it is a very beautiful game with many different decks to use...I did however find the bits  complicated at first and kept confussing them because there are just so many of them and so many details to the game!  As you play it a few times you begin to recognize the cards and can put things together easier....BUT if you are the type of person who likes to get everything done this is not the game for you because you will want/need to do 10 things each turn but are either blocked by another player's choices...or run out of turns in that round before you get it all done. It will leave you wanting to come back again and again...

I enjoy this game and the art of make the best choice with what you have available.  I have mixed feelings about the cards that add variety while sometimes upsetting the balance of the game.  There are times where the right combination of them heavily skews the victory of a game that can be long.  The card translations leave a lot of gray areas especially when they interact with each other.

RATING: 6
Never played. Can't seem to absorb the rulebook. Could it be written more confusingly?

UPDATE: Played half a game, not quite enough for it to sink in but enough to play it solitaire until it sinks in. Having an explainer is the only way to learn this game -- well, unless someone has written a better set of rules.

UPDATE May-16-2011: Played a full five player game. It's okay. There's a lot you want to do and little you get to do. I think the game could be laid out better. There are too many words all over the place and they're not the best chosen. For five players, somebody is going to have a hard time seeing the major improvements (that person was me). I wish the little rules appeared on a help card, like one type of animal per pen, one offspring per animal pair, the steps of harvest are ..., etc. There are a lot of things to juggle in this game, and you can only begin to strategize after you grok all the rules and the scoring. This game is stressful. OTOH, I can see why some people love it.

UPDATE Jun-12-2011: Got rid of my copy. This isn't to say I won't play again, but if I'm going to play it's probably going to be with friends who have their own copies with all the special meeples and containers.

Finally played this game. I was hesitant because of the hype and the theme, but really did want to play. I'm glad I did, it was an enjoyable play with good depth and diversity. As soon as I finished, I wanted to play again - a good sign, but the three-hour play-time made it improbable.

There is almost no luck in this entire game.  Whoever comes up with the best strategy and flexes with the circumstances created by the other players will win.

This is a deep thoughtful game.  It is very rewarding.  

The theme (farming) did not excite me, but I do have to say that it is extremely well done.  The components are great.

Tons of replayability, but its one that i only play once in a while because it is a mental challenge.  This is not a game that you start setting up for a replay as soon as you finish.

I have played A LOT of games and I can tell you that I have never encountered a game that gives me as much enjoyment (and drives me as crazy) as AGRICOLA. I think it is the fact that this is a "building" game and not a "building and running" game that does it for me. If this game had two more rounds, I wouldn't enjoy it nearly as much. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a tough call.  It's a very good game indeed, but perhaps a little too long for what it is - ironically, the very unstructured nature of the game means that it is unlikely to speed up to a great extent.  And yet, even with the ridiculous multiplicity of pieces and cards, it all works.

edit: no, it hasn't got any faster.  And it's still far too fiddly.  And the repetitiveness is starting to show through.  But none of that is a deal-breaker.

edit2: it is a deal-breaker now.  I wouldn't turn the game down if offered the chance to play, but I won't actively nominate it now.  And weirdly, playing it with fast players makes it worse, not better.  (Hmmm.  There must be a geeklist about that.)

edit3: rare example of my rerating a game based on another game!  I have now played Le Havre enough to see that this is the superior game, despite all the flaws I see with it.

Very tense euro. A bit too tense for my tastes ... A favourite of my wife and I respect the game, so we continue to play it from time to time and sometimes introduce it to newish gamers. Good replayability and the 60 minute playing time for 2 players is ideal for us.

The solo version also works well and is more of a challenge than you would think!

Very good game. Played all versions from one to 5 players. The theme lends itself very nicely to the game system. This has elements of Caylus and CCG's. I don't think I need to buy more cards for a game that provides more than enough anyway (Update: Now played so many games it was nice to try a different deck)!!

My copy had boring wooden pieces and thin cards. Not impressed by the quality of these components! a '9.5' for the game system. A '6' for the quality of components.

What can I say, great game. Each decision is hard and tense, with a number of avenues to apply strategy each time its played. 

Downside: Apart from swear words from other players when you take the resource they wanted and/or blocking moves. There is no player interaction in the game.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed it but I wouldn't call it "fun".  I don't think I talked the entire time since I was analyzing every move and trying to calculate all the optimal paths to victory.  I played well and won but not sure I want to play it again any time soon since it takes so long and puts me into an anti-social analytical mood.

RATING: 7
When can be said that hasn't been said before?  Unlike my first playing of Le Favre, Agricola made sense.  Oh sure the various efficiencies and strategic pathways are quite obscure while you're learning the game, but thematic things hang together rather well, and I feel like I was at least able to play the game, if not particularly well.  Lengthy, but moving swiftly, I enjoyed it, and look forward to exploring its depths a bit more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
While Agricola has some good ideas, there are a few things that really hold it back for me, and prevent me from liking the game.

1: There aren't enough good action spaces. Of all of the action spaces I want to go to, I will get to go to at most 1 of them.

2: It takes too much effort to generate food. You should be able to eat animals without building a special card for it.

3: The scoring forces you to get a little bit of everything, and gives you very little for specializing.

4: Workers are too valuable because they are the most efficient way to get points, and the action advantage you get is too important.

5: Many of the cards feel weak.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game, but there are plenty of others that I turn to first. I don't like the way Agricola forces everyone to diversify. I greatly prefer Caverna, which allow players to try out different strategies and follow alternate paths to victory.

RATING: 7
Plays - 10. Awesome game, will prob give it a 10, but I've only played 2 player so far, and with the easy deck of cards. The important part is squeezing the most out of your workers, and a slight risk/reward system (Do you take 3 wood now, or wait til next go, and if no-one has taken it, get 6 wood?)

EDIT: - Played it a bit more since, it is a great game, but there are others I would rather play over this at the moment. Drafting the cards is recommended.

Giving it the benefit of the doubt. 5 player game took 3 hours. Painful.  Would rate the game a 4 with that number of players. For some reason, I think I'd like the game fine playing solo. For that, I suspect I would rate the game an 8 (but we'll see). For each added player, subtract one full rating point to reflect my willingness to play at that number. The replenishment phase got tiresome quickly.
[UPDATE] Played with 3. Much faster. More enjoyable. I think that's about the limit for number of players I'd be willing to stand. Probably best with 2.

Now that I've played it a few times with "good" people, it seems that some of the cards are really powerful in non-obvious ways, and if you don't know what they are, and how to use them, you get killed.  I'm not sure needing to know that much background is a good thing for a game like this..

FUN ★★★★✰
Very good first impression. It looks there are many choices of actions. Moving fields,goods and cattle around is fun. Quite a good interaction with other players as well. Setup takes some time though. Interaction with the other players is quite limited though.

RULES ★★✰✰✰
I've never seen so poorly written rules (as I remember). Concepts are used in the rulebook without having been explained. Very messy way of presenting how to play.

IMMERSION ★★★✰✰
Feed the family and keep resources to invest for the future. It gives a feeling of how it is/was hard for farmers to manage their business. It's sort of family game, therefore don't expect to remember events during the play as it can be the case with some geek games. 

DEPTH ★★★✰✰
There is not a huge depth in this game, but I can imagine that I won't refuse a quick play from time to time (around 30' per player).

Nothing particularly new here, but all blended so well and feels a lot less solitairey than it probably is, due to the worker-placement competition.  Nice sense of achievement when you've got your little family and house and animals and vegetables all laid out on the player mat.  Very nice worker-placement-engine-building game.

This works REALLY well with with anywhere between 2-5 players which makes it very versatile.

A brilliant design - extremely clever game. Funnily enough I don't like it as much as I might - maybe it's some aspects of the theme that irritate - why can only one family reproduce at a time - why only one worker able to gather wood (or whatever) - so it's not an outright favourite of mine but the overall ratings don't lie - this is a great game.

After one session with four players, I can appreciate the potential for variety, but I wouldn't really call it fun. It was surprising how many actions turned out to be wasted due to my misunderstanding of options for future actions. I'd play again, but not with the same anticipatory excitement.

There's simply no way to sum up my experience with this game in short order. It's complicated. I love this game and I hate this game. It's a blast - a brutal, brutal blast.

I will say one specific thing about the Occupations in this game - they vary too much in power level. Most suck. I hate drafting a bunch of duds. And it feels no better to play a game-warping occupation that hands you the game. (Improvements, on the other hand, are fantastic - they usually don't alter the whole game, but just help you optimize.)

RATING: 9
I suppose I'm now one of the legions of people who are in love with this game.  I'm continuing to find it quite fun.  The one gripe I've got is that with games like this, your last turn or two tends to become a fairly mechanical process of attempting to eke out the optimal scoring conditions on your farmyard, which I feel drags the endgame a little bit.  Oh, and science MUST be able to provide us with a good solution to setup/teardown with this game.  Get on it, scientists.  I'll see how well this ages with time, of course, but in general I'm quite fond of it.

I don't get the hype.
I regret spending 42€ (normally I would never spend that much on one game, but ... hey this game must be really special) on this game.
It's boring, plays rather quick, has ugly art work, silly cards, fiddly pieces, ...I could go on for a while!

One good thing about getting this game, from now on: before buying a game I ask myself even more the question: do I really need this game or should I spent my money on other things in life and just play all the games in my collection that don't get the playing time they deserve.

RATING: 6
Action Choice Drafting with many action choices, complex scoring and great scalability with number of players. 

Solid game, but nothing "wow" in design. Seems like the only big defining thing of the game is that there are a lot of things you need to do, and lots of text-heavy cards, and you don't have enough actions to do everything, so you have to choose and balance trade-offs. Other games have this too, just not taken to such an extreme. But I'd want to have this game if stranded on a desert island with 3-4 other gamers, since the cards give unlimited, if contrived, replay value. Solid and infinitely replayable but nothing particularly special.

I don't understand wtf is so awesome about the cards. They infuse a huge dose of luck into the game, especially since you can't deduce what other people have due to the sheer volume of cards. This game's use of cards is the exact way I hate cards are used for board games (for unnecessary complexity, increasing luck and rewarding experience, and allowing for cheap, no-effort expansions). 

Perfect the Family Game (without the cards), which stands up to less than 10 plays (exposing the shallowness of this game), instead of including a ton of cards in the base game and passing it off as an essential part of the game when it really is 3 expansions already packaged in.

I would have preferred it if the design was such that 14 random cards were laid out every game in some common pool, and you could use the Occupation or Minor Improvement action space to draft one of the cards from the pool and play it, after paying its costs. I prefer this pseudo-Family Game version, because the hidden information with the cards just disrupts the well-themed elegance of this game.

Drafting the cards isn't bad either though. It's a good excuse to read cards before the game so I don't have to keep referring back to them during the game.

I like it, but not as much as Uwe Rosenborg's Le Havre.  It just seems to me to be too much like multiplayer solitaire to get it to the table ahead of other games.  Like I said, I do like it and playing it with the cards really adds some depth to it.  I'd still be happy to play it if folks want to play.

After reflecting on my last time playing, I have to upgrade this to a 9.  It really has some great elements and the pain of getting beaten to something you really want is exquisite.

I definitely like it more than Le Havre, which is on the cusp on getting traded.

I've found that I really enjoy this game and continue to want to play, actually seeking out additional opportunities to play, which is not a particularly common occurence anymore.  I'm still undecided on the cards, though I do think they add a lot to the game--good or bad is the question.  I imagine that it will be a while before that is firmly decided in my mind.  The animeeples are neat and add more to the game than I would have expected, though not enough for me to deck out my own copy with them.  Overall, the design makes me think that it is something that Knizia would come up with--way too much that you want to do and not nearly enough actions to get it all done.  I suppose that could be pretty high praise depending on your point of view.  The choices are deliciously agonizing.  As an added benefit, I can play this with my kids as well as gamers.  An excellent product. [10/29/2008]

Fun game with lots of options and micromanagement. Multiple paths to victory which is excellent. Love seeing my farm expand throughout the game.

Unfortunately the random draw for minor improvements and occupations pretty much decides who will win the game based on who gets the best cards and whether they combo well together. We have somewhat 'fixed' this by playing a variant where they are chosen in a take one and pass manner (similar to 7 wonders) so everyone has a more even hand.

Still one of our favorite games overall.  This was our first "heavy" game we played and I think we'll always enjoy this one.  We will never play without the cards now, as they add so many options and make the game play much better.  A classic in our minds!

There's  a lot of good things that can be said about this game. This is a thematic Euro that eases you well into the life of a farmer. Lots to do, but thanks to the game's superb interface, it's very easy to teach and play. Cards add a lot to the game, theme, and replayability. It scales perfectly due to the game "changing" for different number of players.

There is truly a lot of game out of the box. Any aspiring Eurogamer can't go wrong by this game.

Now having played this game numerous times, I find it a bit odd that it's #1 on the Geek.  I really really like this game, but it's fiddly and sometimes frustrating.  I wouldn't expect it to be so popular.  But it's wonderfully challenging, scales amazingly well from 1-5 players (although the 5 player game does take a while), and the variety of paths to victory is fantastic.  Each game will be different due to the order of "actions" that come up, and the vast array of cards (occupations and small improvements) included.  As you play it, you marvel at the design:  so much game in this box!  It's too early for me to tell whether Agricola will endure as a personal favorite, but right now I find myself thinking about it more than I care to admit.

Downgrading this to an 8 (from 8.5) solely because I NEVER get it to the table.  Just a bit too heavy to teach to newcomers.  I really like it and hope I can train a group up on it one day to get the most out of it.

RATING: 7
Fine game that is surprisingly hard to play well. I didn't like how that diversity in the different ways to earn points leads to only a couple of valid strategies, leading to there always being competition in a 3 player game for one field, meaning that the third player who did another strategy can just take the game. The cards add variation but also imbalance. I wish they could seed this game like dominion.

RATING: 8
The strength difference of the initial cards each player starts with can make it impossible for some players to win in a competitive game.  The other big issue I have with this game is the way turn order does not change unless someone takes the action to change it.  Still a great game but a few small rules changes would have made this nearly perfect.

For me, Caverna pretty much fires Agricola.  I do like the randomization that Agricola has due to the card drafting, but I prefer playing Caverna far more.

Painful. A dull, uninspiring theme loosely linked to a bunch of tedious, fussy mechanics followed up with an overly complex and arbitrary scoring system. Each game is a grueling experience that alternates between stultification and exasperation as the more AP-prone players dither over a plethora of fiddly options that are only compounded by the complicated and contradictory card texts.

RATING: 3
Hard one to rate. So let's try. 

Backstory 1: Had a copy of this one borrowed for years (3, 4? lost count) as original owner found it too complicated and gave up. After playing Le Havre (rating 3) I wasn't very enthusiastic about it either. But playing a couple of "boring euros" for informative reasons I finally caved in. It was a promise of 3 player game of starting to casual skill that convinced me. 

And I was actually pleasantly surprised. Compared to Le Havre I enjoy this game much more: 1) It's shorter. 2) It's much more thematic. This is the main strength I see in it. It's the joy of running an engine and see your farm literally grow. It has a narrative I can embrace. 3) It has more focus - some say it's more confined than Le Havre, but this is a plus - I don't have to think about all the actions each and every turn as some actions I just have to make based on previous decision. Agricola actually gives me a better focus and easier to make lists of priorities whereas in Le Havre all options are equal, bland and boring. 

Problems of the game are threat of over thinking and optimisation. The fact that the game has limited number of turns has it's good sides (doesn't take that long to play) and serious down side: it's potentially calculable and prone to optimisation exercises. And that's why I can't give it a higher rating - I will definitely avoid playing it with certain players who analysed it to death. It's just not an aspect of gaming I care about - I will play this one for the story not for trying to win, the same as I play RFTG.

Backstory 2: Played it with GF and she hated it. One reason is that it's still too much thinking. For me I guess I do these processes so fast I have free space in my mind for narrative building. So I can optimise and calculate as long as it's not an end in its own, but serves a different goal (narrative building). But the most important reason she disliked the game is theme and harvest: [i]"we just paid the bills and you think I want to play a game where I worry like in real life if I can make it through the month?!"[/i] Yes, she likes fantasy themes, unrelated to real life much better. So I have to find other people interested in this, but not already too interested.

Una pasada el juego. Al primero que le doy un 10, Mejor en el modo avanzado.
Sin duda es al mejor juego que he jugado nunca.
Aunque la perfección no existe, este se acerca bastante.
Es como un Caylus o Pilares de la tierra, pero mucho mas divertido, mas intuitivo y con mas opciones... que se merienda a los otros dos, con todas las de la ley.
Y cuando te aburres de la versión familiar (que de por si, esta muy bien), tienes tropecientas cartas para jugar. Va a ser dificil aburrirse de este juego.
Encima hay variantes muy jugables (sobre todo la del Draft) y modo solitario que aún no me ha dado tiempo a probarlo.
Está en perfecto Español.

Only solitaire and 2-player games so far. It seems we have developed a very cut-throat (and interactive) way of playing for 2p with using many ways for hurting the opponent and stopping his/her plans. Looking forward for more player games as well.
2009-09-30 after first learning game of Le Havre I decreased the rating 9->8.5 as it pales a bit in comparison.
2009-11 Decreased a bit again 8.5->8 (I opened the box to play with my wife after a longer time and I put it away as I was just overwhelmed by the components and not in a mood to scan through the rules to get everything OK)

RATING: 9
It seems to be a game with all the expansions already thrown in. They added a lot more than they needed to, and it all seems to work. Rather long; however a good game.

The end game can get a little dull, since the scoring forces you to do a series of rather dull plays in the last few rounds. Some of the cards are a little better than others, and some labeled for two-player are not really appropriate for the two-player game.

And it's long, fiddly, and scary for new players.

Played two 4P and two 5P games. Agricola is a surprisingly thematic worker placement game, but its strength does not lie in its worker placement mechanism. The various occupations and minor improvements that players receive at the start are really what makes Agricola unique. I also enjoy the gradual opening of slots as well. 

The main thing that I don't enjoy about Agricola is that you're basically doomed if you can't recognise the synergy of your cards early on. The game is not particularly forgiving if you realise that a combo doesn't work as planned, or if you try to change plans halfway through.

It's hard to say this game is ENJOYABLE since much of it is spent drowning in tension.  This is one of the first games I've played that had me begging for just one more round so I can complete X task.

RATING: 7.5
This is the game by which I measure many others, even though I don't have as much enthusiasm for playing it these days. Just the basic game is great, then other options add extra depth... however playing Farmers of the Moor once was enough. Agricola gives you enough to think about and doesn't need add-ons. The only reason I don't give it a higher mark is because it just doesn't make it to the table that often - perhaps because it feels a bit 'dry' compared to many, and we like to play a couple of games if we can rather than one long one. EDIT Now I've played Caverna I prefer the newer game. The stress of feeding in Agricola is much lighter in Caverna and as a result the game feels less dry, more fun, but still with the tension of someone beating you to your ideal spot...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The family game is extremely balanced, but slightly dry. The card game is extremely fun, but slightly imbalanced. This is as close to perfection as I've experienced in a boardgame, though. The fun factor keeps it ranked high. 

Drawbacks: 

-Long playing time with many players, especially with cards.
-Cards can add imbalance.

[36 plays]  I've played 2 player, 3 player, and 5 player games all with the "E" decks. I've played one 4 player game with the "I" deck.

The first game seemed hard to learn from reading the rules, but was actually fairly easy once we got going.

This is a game that seems overwhelming in its options after the first game, almost as though it is simply offering too much. For me, that disappeared almost immediately in my second game. Now, although there are delightful moments of indecision and calculation, I don't find it complicated or overreaching at all.

This is a superb game. It seems like it will have endless variety and challenges and will scale very well from solitaire play on up to 5 players. I love the art. I like the card combinations, the tough choices, the jockeying for valuable actions, and the feeling of never being able to do as much as you can envision. I also agree with the reviewers that have commented on how much pride you take in the growth of your little farm.

Then 6/4/11 with Corey, John S, and Michael. I was reminded in this play how solid the base game is, and while I like the idea of the Moor expansion, I'm not sure it really added anything that wasn't taken away by the length of the added time in that previous play. I just love the base game, but I'll probably still give the Moor expansion some more chances.

The 'Gric! Also dubbed Misery Farm by the haters- a term I have adopted using but in a loving fashion! This game offers tough decisions and great replayability due to the occupation and minor improvement cards. I don't ever feel like I've fully accomplished what I want to do before the game is suddenly over. And there is the constant struggle to feed your people. Yet this game makes all of those things work in a satisfying way that always makes me want to play again. I really enjoyed playing through the solo series on the app. Until recently, I had not played this game in some time. I could sense it starting to lose some of my favor. But then I played again with a group of strangers at a board game meetup and was reminded that I freaking love this amazing game.

RATING: 2
Got this pretty much only because it is near the top of my geekbuddy ratings as well as this other correlation tool (can't remember the url at the moment). Anyway, I asked Michelle what she thought, and she said, "Frustrating." As a fan of "all creatures," I have to say that it doesn't really feel much like the smaller game. 

This incites an astounding amount of AP in Michelle, so there is a lot of downtime for me. She also doesn't like that "too much to do, and not enough time" feeling that Agricola seems to inspire in everyone that plays it. Both of these factors, along with a sense that she doesn't understand how to optimize anything, add up to an experience that is more like (very frustrating) work rather than play. 

I can see why people like it, but it's definitely not for me. And even if it were, we'd need to get the downtime much lower for it to be enjoyable. We can't do that without rushing Michelle, which I don't want to do. We even tried the family game, and it didn't go any better. She didn't really play any faster, and it has the bonus of having almost zero variation play to play. While I doubt we are playing well (or even decently) yet, I don't see how there is enough in the family game to support more than 1 or 2 viable strategies. At least in the full games, the cards open up a lot of possibilities. 

Before I forget, I found out (a few months ago) that this is considered a highly thematic euro. I don't see it. Mechanically, it doesn't seem any more thematic than Stone Age. To me, the gold standard in thematic euros is Dungeon Petz, which is not only way (way) more thematic, but also more fun. Maybe that's what I always found snore-inducing about Agricola back when I first got into boardgames: so many fiddly psuedo-thematic rules for no payoff. 

Now that we've finished our 10 plays for the 10x10 challenge, I really don't see us ever playing it again.

The most boring, ridiculously convoluted euro game I have ever played!

To be fair, while euros are not my favourite style of game, I do enjoy the farming theme immensely so I had high hopes that this one might deliver.

For I game I had heard nothing but high praise of upon it's release, I was incredibly underwhelmed with this game upon playing it. From the extremely lengthy set up to the incredibly boring gameplay, my hopes were squashed quite quickly with this one.

Will never play again and I now have an extremely expensive reminder in my collection to always take the hype with a grain of salt.

One of those games which take longer than planned and make you always feel that you're in last.  Also takes a while to get your head around all the different rules.  That said, it's a clever game which I can see others would enjoy and I'd happily fill in a player if required.

RATING: 9.5
Well let's start with what we always hear about Agricola. "It's so punishing" "It makes you do everything I just wanna herd sheep" "You're basically just busting your ass to feed your family." All good points, but Agricola is not about WHAT you have to do, but HOW you do it. That's where the game takes shape and it's the occupations and minor improvements that help you dictate HOW you are going to build that complete farm. Yes the game is punishing, but that is not a flaw it is part of the genius of its design.

RATING: 10
An extremely enjoyable and well designed "worker placement" optimization game with a variety of ways to win. The theme is surprisingly interesting and, unlike Puerto Rico, I never forget what it is. The cards add another layer of depth and variety, as well as some randomness. Yes, some of the cards are better than others, but there are several optional rules which will minimize the luck of the draw.

IOS IPAD only

UPDATE: after a few plays against AI on IPAD... Definitely hurts the brain... and can be very analytical... BUT I am enjoying my games, a lot to think about and do within each turn. Will need a lot more plays though...

Can see why so many rate this... maybe not totally my type of game...Not sure how often I would play this, as games seem a bit too long for my liking. So I'm not going to be getting the hard copy anytime soon.

Despite this, I do like the theme, and it works within the game.

RATING: 9
Seems a bit overwhelming when you start reading the rules, but is easy to play after the first game you try. Agricola gives you many options how to develop your farm and this is what makes it such a winner.

Works actually just as well, wheater you play with two or more players. This is not a nasty game as other players really can't do you that much harm.

RATING: 8.5
The worker placement genre has been around for long enough now that I need to look at Agricola and determine if it's in my collection *just* because "it's Agricola," or if it really serves a particular niche. With how much I loved Manhattan Projects, I think I'm willing to say it's the former.

Will be looking to unload at the Gen Con Math Trade/Flea Market.

I've played this twice so far and like it quite a bit.  It could possibly end up being my 3rd favorite game, but I do not see it replacing Puerto Rico or Caylus as my # 1 or #2 unless it really shows me something special in the plays to come.

RATING: 9.8
A brilliant competitive foraging game. The scoring structure makes for a well defined end game goal space. Variability comes from two sources: 1) The timing of when certain resources & opportunities gets introduced into the game differs from game to game, but in a very constrained manner. 2) The hand of cards provides each player some foraging advantages - but only in subtle ways.

This isn't a game. I've never seen it, nor do I believe it exists. It's actually a huge prank, who's sole purpose is to expose just how pathetic some of the people on this site are. The hissy-fit/Nerd Rage that has come from this game is staggering in it's intensity and hilarious is it's complete irrelevance.

I should have known that the only game to be able to dethrone the overrated Puerto Rico would be an overrated clone.  It's better than Puerto Rico, but much along the same lines.  Solid game, but not even close to as good as the hype.  It's a mathematical calculation more than a game.  And it doesn't make logical sense, so as to provide balance.  "I can build two rooms and three stables in the same time I can widdle a potato dibber"  I understand the need for the balance, but I come away shaking my head at the stupidity of that.

The game is overrated. That doesn't mean it's a bad game just not as great as most players rate it. 

Too many cards, they could have easily cut the quantity in half. They do help push the players into different strategies and variety more than the family game ruleset. However sometimes the combos are too overwhelming or too underwhelming. 

The tension in the game is about right and it's challenging to get everything you need to get done. 

I enjoy playing now and then.

I tried to ignore the hype, but this game honestly looked like a lot of fun.  Once Pozy had this available, I had to bite.

It has the worker placement mechanic of some of my other favorite games, but the cards make me rethink strategy every game, which is a fresh change.  A few misprints on the rules and cards make me want to "dock a few points" but this game is just too good to care.

...and count me in as a person who could care less about animeeples.  That the cubes match the pictures on the cards helps with identification and learning.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Worker Placement, Building, Resource Management. Impressions after a first play (2p) are very favorable. Learning was confusing at first but we can see already that the play time of 30 minutes per player is very achievable once everyone knows how to play. Looking forward to many more plays.

Update: played another 2p. Great game - this one played totally differently from the first, and we're still just using the E deck. I'm really looking forward to playing 3-5p.

Update: played 3p and 4p now. Bumped this up to a 10 - it's a classic for me and I don't foresee ever not enjoying it.

Final Update: okay, it's a solid 9, no more, no less. Haven't played it in a while and need to.

A really great worker placement game. The strategies you implement change every time and the cards add a lot to the game. Very fun game. Once I get a few more plays in, the rating will probably go up.

This is a great two player game. My fiance and I have been playing this one a lot lately. Very glad I own it now. It was not very popular with my group (some prefer more of the Ameritrash stuff, others train games). It has proven quite popular with my fiance, though. As of right now, this is basically a two player game for me.

I guess I'm in a minority hating this game, but really... Agricola doesn't do it for me. There's too many strange limitations on what you can do when, and too little player interaction. The only real way you can influence someone else is to prevent them taking the actions they need. To me, that feels a bit cold and impersonal.

Note: I've only played this once and watched it a couple of times.

Overrated.

It reminds me of Stone Age without the dice with a bit of something like Pillars of Earth thrown in.  I've only played the most basic of game versions so far.  

The Good: Lots of decisions.  I didn't exactly have a BAD time playing the game.

The Bad: All the decisions could lead to some analysis paralysis for some players.  However, there really didn't seem to be very many "interesting" decisions in the introductory game.  What type of fireplace do you want to build?  Boring...  The game has developed a craze, and I just don't usually like to play Eurogames that have that much mania behind them.  Like Stone Age, I didn't see any raiding party variant, so in many ways it's just another version of multi-player solitaire with no confrontation.  This is what everyone has been waiting a year to play?!  I don't see the hype, yet... 

The Ugly: God, what a depressing theme!  Farming and feeding people.  The plague rats from Notre Dame were more exciting and fun...  The production artwork looked good, but the wooden pieces of slightly different colors and threat of needing to replace the possible inferior animal tokens was LAME...  

UPDATE:  I guess it's not as lame as I thought, but it can quite tough for new players.

Agricola is an amazing game. It was the first Euro game that was ever presented to me and since then I have played better, but this is still one of the best. I love everything about it, but it can take quite some time to play with several people and putting resources on the board in bigger games can be a pain. Other than that though Agricola is one of those great Euro games that will hold a special place in my heart forever.

Finally arrived and after 4 solo plays and 1 4-player game seems to be amazingly good. Fun, balanced, colourful and attractive... we could already see how the cards can completely transform each game. Brilliant.

I really enjoy all you can do with this game.  Tons of choices and with the large number of jobs you won't be seeing the same ones every game.  The number of strategies you can do to win is numerous, and just like any worker placement you must be adaptive.

Other than that it is long and new players will struggle to compete with more experienced players.  Still, that is to be expected of this type of game and why some like them.

This is one of those games where you want to play the game with others who are learning at the same time as you.  If you're behind in the learning curve you'll find yourself frustrated as this game is weighed heavily in favour of those who have played several times (card combos, knowing the full useage of cards, knowing the rhythym & patterns of the game...etc)

Can only speak to two-player experience. Heavier and thinkier than my wife and I often want (so many contingencies and permutations to calculate). That said, we love the long-term strategic planning based on the initial selection of occupation and improvement cards. Game play mechanisms seem complex at first (lots of bits), but operate smoothly. Mental processing power is really the only stumbling block here. Overall, an excellent game that I'm not always capable of playing.

Tema interesante con un desarrollo desafiante. Juego casi sin azar con mecánicas enrevesadas aunque bien ajustadas. Muchos detalles importantes y muchos objetivos a lograr, improbables de conseguir todos. Por ello transmite cierta sensación de suspense o de agobio según el parecer del jugador. Proclive al parálisis, especialmente con muchos jugadores.
Por todo ello prefiero la versión de reglas "familiar" con menos elementos. 

Las numerosas expansiones en mi opinión lo enredan todavía más.

Interesting argument with a challenging development. Almost no random and convoluted mechanics although well-adjusted. Many important details and many goals to achieve, unlikely to get all. Therefore conveys a sense of suspense or overwhelmed according to the opinion of the player. Prone to paralysis, especially with many players.
Therefore I prefer the "family" version of the rules with fewer elements.

The numerous expansions in my opinion even more entangled.

Easy to see why this is a classic.  I always describe it as a "lean" game: it seems like you're barely able to scrape by while maintaining enough momentum to increase your ability to gain points.  There's a sense of accomplishment when you're able to pull off a big combo that gets you a ton of food or points.  I often feel that I can step back and be proud of what I've built even when I haven't won.

Építsd meg saját farmod. Vess, arass, nevelj különböző állatokat és bővítsd a dolgozó családodat. A téma és a jól kidolgozott játékmenet miatt nem lep meg a játék népszerűsége, de az első-második helyen való szereplése azért mindenképp kicsit túlzás szerintem. A családi változattal játszottam csak még, így nálam 7-est érdemel, de természetesen adok neki még esélyt a több pont elérésére.

[2011-06-06]
Megkapta a második esélyt. Igaz még mindig családi változat, de most sem érzem azt az átütő érzést, ami miatt a játék ott van a toplistán ahol. Egy jó játékról van szó, ami talán még azért kedvelhetnek mert egyáltalán nem lehet a másiknak keresztbe tenni. Mert még ha a legjobb lehetőséget el is happolják előled a sok másik közül biztos van még jó. 5 játékossal talán hosszúra nyúlhat egy-egy játék, hárman tökéletesen működött és időben is megfelelő volt. Egy jó játék az Agricola egy kellemes témával, de én egyáltalán nem érzem átütőnek, de a végső értékelést a profi változat után fogom levonni, addig is marad a pontszám.

[2011-09-26]
Megtörtént a profi változat kipróbálása. Nem emelek a pontszámon. Meglepő, de nagy változást reméltem, de igazából csak pár lap a különbség, ami persze még megnehezíti a játékot, mert a rengeteg lehetőség és a szűkös körszám miatt nagyon nehéz dönteni mit végezzenek az embereink. Jó játék az Agricola, de számomra nagyon frusztráló. Szívesen játszom még vele, aztán meglátjuk a pontszámot.

[2012-05-02]
A frusztráció megvan, de mégis emelnem kell a pontszámon, mert a második profi játék vele már nagyobb élményt adott. Tényleg sokat javítanak a kártyák a játékon. Nagyobb a variancia és fontos, hogy próbáljuk a stratégiánkat a lapokra kihegyezni, ezzel tudjuk ugyanis a legtöbb pontot szerezni a végén. Sokat jelent az is, hogy eddig minden társaságban működött és mindig mindenki élvezi a játékot vele.

Worker placement games have been done to death in recent years. I'm sick of them. Agricola is one of the few in my opinion that are worth playing.

[i]Building Your Farm and Competing Over Resources is Fun! Better with Fewer Players (faster + more competitive)[/i]

Will only play with 2-3 players.
 
this game still has something most similar games lack: real tension because the game is demanding and other players actions can truly screw you. The farming theme is cool and makes you feel like you're really doing something. It's fun to see the result of your labor at end of game.

and there's a lot more interaction in 2 or 3 player, because blocking becomes much more powerful. That combined with the shorter length makes 2 and 3 player my favorite ways to play. Why clog up the game with more players just to make the game worse and drag it out longer?

(4 Design + 3 Enjoyment)

Why Design Isn't Maxed Out: Mostly because of the cards, which probably aren't very balanced, are pretty fiddly in an otherwise elegant game, etc. Would probably fit better if they were publically drafted. 

Why Enjoyment Isn't Maxed Out: Usually I'd rather play something more exciting.

2nd go at it we slogged through and finished the game. It picked up a bit, but sadly disappointed that tokens (especially wood) kept running out and having to use the x4 cardboard peices. Really weak for the cost of this game. It did pick up a bit as we got the hand of it, but it will be tough to get the group to try it again.

Very good, well-designed game.  Farming is fun!  Personal gripes are mainly with the length of the game and how punishing it can be, with food management and getting key choices stolen at the wrong time.  That said, the card play is really exciting and offers great variability, and there is so much going on that it transcends the simple worker-placement mechanics.  A classic game that is absolutely worth playing, even if not among my very favorite euros.

If there ever was a shining example of theme present in a Eurogame, this is it.  This is the best game representing animal husbandry out there.

Certainly, this is a great "too many things to do, not enough turns to do them" kind of game.  It has you in engaged.  

There is so much information to try to take in with this, though, that you may feel a little shell shocked.  

The starting hands can be a little unbalanced.  I would like to be able to trade in some of your cards, so that you could try to form a hand that might actually work with itself.

Why can't I win being a successful cattle rancher?  Why do I have to wait until later turns for different animals and advances in 16th century farming techniques?  

The game may offer you a lot of choices and it may seem to fit the theme, but the victory point spread, exclusivity of nearly all the actions, and penalties for non optimal play make me feel the game railroads me into building the exact same farm every damn game.

Bought the iPad version just to see if I'd like it more without having to juggle all the games bits and bobs, but it turns out I still don't care for it.

Clearly our family favourite which is surprising.  I initially thought it would get dry and repetitive but it is always a struggle with 4 or 5 players to get the resources you want.  I believe that without the cards this is exactly what would happen but the cards tend to draw you in different directions - to try different tactics ...

This game is great.  There are many paths to victory, and the theme is fun.  It even works as a gateway game. Not in terms of being easy or light, but in terms of drawing people in to board gaming in general.

It loses points for the fact that you have little or no control over the fact that other players can totally ruin your day. And not necessarily on purpose, but because they also need the same thing you need, and turn order made all the difference.  So you lost because of turn order.

What I mean is, it is really hard to adopt a new strategy on the fly, to match the situation, because when other players block you, it hurts. Bad.

Agricola is pretty good, and deserving of its high user rating on BGG.  I've played the game a couple of times, and I've enjoyed it each time,  My problem seems to be that I am playing with players that are more experienced with the game and have a better analytical grasp of what actions to take when... many times I need one particular action and end up not getting it due to turn order.  Still, a solid game.

I like how at the end of the game you have this cool farm that you built.  Unfortunately, I felt like the game itself was overly complex.  I doubt my wife would like it, considering all the fiddliness involved in the game.  Maybe more plays will change my mind.

UPDATE: After a second play, I think I just needed to be eased into the more advanced mechanics of the game a little slower.  Learning all the rules PLUS dealing with the minor improvements and professions all in one go just felt like too much work for me.

RATING: 9
Agricola is a very complex game. The first time you play it, don't expect to get a high score. In my opinion Agricola never get's old. The game doesn't rely on luck, but on strategically choosing your angle on how to earn points. We've been playing it in my gaming group for a while, and have found it very fun to start each new game with an occupation played in our earlier game, so that each player starts out with a sort of strategy that they can either build on or ignore.

The base game is perfectly fine in it self and different every time, but if you really crave for a change in the game, I would recommend getting the "farmers of the moor" expansion before investing in additional card decks.

Ahh yes, Agricola. . .easily as much buzz as Puerto Rico received when it was first released. I liked this game almost immediately. Spent a lot of initial time with it solo, which is good practice for when you get to multi-player with local group. Have yet to attain the first game solitaire goal of 50 points, though I'm making steady progress. Much easier to teach (and be taught) this game than to read rules to decipher. This game would get a higher rating if it got to the table a few more times, but generally speaking, people tend to roll their eyes when it's suggested. Everybody agrees that mechanically, artistically and replayably, that it's a great game, but it seems that the investment of time and energy to actually get it out onto a table and play the damn thing is too much to bear sometimes. Extrapolating from the WBC event report from 2008, about 30 people signed on for the tournament last year, and I'm guessing that once your head gets wrapped around the idea that you're actually going to sit down to play it, the enthusiasm and fun inherent in what it has to offer emerges. The problem (with local groups and family gatherings) seems to be that initial decision to select it. Too many games that don't burn as many brain cells to select from. It's just more of a grind than a lot of people choose to deal with at a game gathering.
Still like it, though, and continuing to want to improve at it enough to keep it in the forefront of games that I'd generally like to play.

RATING: 9.5
Much better and infinitely more charming than its current competition for the "greatest of all Euros" title (Puerto Rico). Would really benefit from a meeple dispenser--all that wrangling of "3 wood here, 2 reeds there" gets on my nerves a bit. Some people hate the "feed your family" mechanic, but I really like it--it helps to narrow the range of possible strategies in a game that would otherwise be truly overwhelming.

Game made in 2007 is still very playable and better than many new euros released last 5 years. Tight worker placement game where the threat of negative points hangs over your head.

I should give it a chance, maybe I was just in a poor match or something.  But so fFar, i fFeel towards this the way some people fFeel towards chess: It is all the rage in some circles, and everyone else seems to know the game much better than me.  So much better, in fFact, that they can't really even explain the game properly.  Mostly this makes it seem weak and over rated.  EDIT: I own it now, because a bunch of people around me want to play it more.  Okay.  Now I get to learn to play it better.

This is the opposite of Cosmic Encounter. Every action is incremental. Every turn is eking out. Every card let's you do something minutely better. I feel like I'm continually suffocating. However, the saving grace of the game is that the turns are relatively quick and so even though a game may last two hours, I never feel bored. Also, I feel like I could actually improve at this game by recognizing card combos better. Overall, I'd like to play some more, but I don't know if it will be a keeper in my collection.

Simple rules, easy to explain and insert new players. The game, however, is difficult and punitive. Played poorly planned can make you skate the entire match. Very fun and immersive.

A lot of fun, although the site I play online, is turned based.  As players may only play once per day, I have serious problems remembering what strategy I was going to employ for each game.  Will probably slow down on this one for that reason.  You would think I would be getting better after so many plays, but alas, not so!

RATING: 9
After all the hype for this game I finally bought it and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was really good. I certainly think that the fact that every game will play differently because each player only uses 14 of the 300+ cards that come with the game will help keep my attention. I do feel like a horrible hand of cards can be very hard to overcome though, but maybe I just don't know the game well enough to see how this can be better dealt with.

Agricola was pretty fun. I played a simplified version without the Professions or the Minor Improvements so I could get to know the game.

Learning curve isn't too bad either.

So many things to do before the last action!!!

Thanks to the multiple card combinations as well as a random placement of the tiles, every game is different.

What is not is the stress to not get any malus at the end of the game, the race to feed your mipples each end of season and the feeling of unfinished game...

Argggg, if only I had one more tour... ;)

I think the "tremendous variability" touted by Agricolytes is overstated - everybody still scores victory points for the same things, and your cards dictate the order in which you hit those marks. It also seems like you whether you get a fistful of synergy or complete shit in your opening hand kinda determines how much fun you're going to have for the rest of the game. Either things'll play out smoothly or you're going to bust your ass making the best of a bad draw and lose anyway.

I still wouldn't turn down a game, but if we're set on a Euro, I wouldn't play it over Puerto Rico either.

I ordered Agricola sight unseen based on the buzz. Then I read the rules translation and played with the Flash program a bit and just didn't "get" it. I was afraid I had made a mistake. However, after my first real play, I now "get" it. This is a very fun game. My instinct is that I like it more than Puerto Rico, but I'll reserve rating it until I play it again. Play count includes 1 solo game.

It took me a play to learn what the heck I should be doing, and then it took me another play to figure out if this is for me or not.  Well, I STILL can't say.  I need another play.  Regardless, I don't see it topping my Top 50 anytime soon, if ever.  The theme is certainly there, it's just not a theme I enjoy. *update* I have found that I actually enjoy the iOS version much more than the cardboard.  Rarely happens but I would rate it through iOS a 7.5

This game makes me feel like a farmer.  Farming is hard and sucks.  It's too stressful.  
How can I get my sheep to pull the cows, while dragging them through the fields, and plowing and sowing them, at the same time as feeding my damn kids in my house, who are probably playing board games instead of out in the swamp collecting reed, or in the forest collecting wood, to build the fences that should have contained the damn animals in the first place...

I like it more and more every time I play it. The decisions you have to make are agonizingly difficult. Maybe falls short of 10 because it is a bit, I don't know, inelegant?

Played 5 players with the E deck last night and thought it was just excellent. Sooooooo much going on that its going to take a bunch of plays to wrap my head around. But this might be the ultimate engine builder that actually has an integrated theme! Who would have thought? Hats off to Mr. Rosenberg for presenting us with a winner.Yummy wooden bits, tons of cards with great artwork. Major Improvements, Minor Improvements, Occupations, Action cards, Beggars, Phase cards, the list goes on. Do you use a plough and sow strategy? Raise livestock? Grow your family quickly or over time? When do you upgrade to stone? The questions go on with no wrong answers.I know that the wealth of Occupation and Minor Improvement cards is frustrating for some, but I think it makes you have to adapt and change your strategy. Its a very maleable approach to gaming that had me at draft. All in all, its a gigantic effort and it just works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An easy 10.  tight, several ways to win, phenominal replayability due to the obscene amount of cards - looks great, cool bits, highly pimpable (easy to upgrade the bits), and one of my favorite two player, as well as solo games. It has blown me away, and will for a long time. 

I'm struggling to find anything on the downside to say, but ill try: it is very puzzle-ish once you have it down. This means you will be analizing your board and thinking stuff like: "wait, now if i get three more wood, I can hold one more sheep and feed one more person, so I wont have to use my grain to bake bread, so I can plant it in my field instead, but ill need to get another field, which I can do if I play this card, but this card requires three more wood...wait." All part of the fun though! 

My other gripe depends completely on the gaming group. With my group, the game is amazing, but it can be played much more cut-throat than we do. For example, if someone is obviously getting ready to take some boar because they have made a sweet fenced pasture for them, someone else can just swoop in and take them, even if they have room for none of them - the boar can be taken and then set free. To me, mechanics like this just seem malicious, and change the game quite a bit, but as I said, if your group is not like this, it shouldn't be a problem.

A great game with constant pressure, both from the game design itself with a plethora of scoring criteria, and from the other players. I particularly like you have to immediatly perform the chosen action, instead of after all placements have been made like most other worker placement games. You are very limited in your number of actions and there really is a lot to do. There are a ton of different resources and a lot of planning is involved when managing these resources and actions. The hand management keeps this game replayable. Everybody basically needs the exact same things; the cards make sure everybody takes a different route to get to meet the scoring criteria.
It's a very complete game, with a family and an advanced game. Also, there are three different decks of cards making sure this game is even more replayable.
It's not all perfect though, set up and take down takes quite a while and the game lacks a proper storage tray. I had to buy some plastic boxes myself.
I've only played this as a 2-player game. I would love to play with more players, even if it just introduces some new occupations for 3+ games.

I've pimped my game with the wooden building resources and the wooden vegetables and grain resources from Lookout Games and the wooden food tokens from Boardgame Extras.

Better than Puerto Rico? Yes.  Worthy of the hype? Not quite.  It's a quality game, and I understand why so many people like it: the cards provide for great replayability plus they also inspire goals that you really desire to work toward.  There are many paths to victory, and the game is really tight, forcing you to choose from among many actions.  I do believe it has a bunch of depth and it's a quality release.  Still, it does lack quite a bit in player interaction and it is so tight through the first few rounds that it's pretty frustrating.  Also, there are so many choices that turns can drag on a while.  Bottom line is that this a deeper game that I enjoy playing, but it's not my favorite.  I am glad it knocked off Puerto Rico, though.

UPDATE: I'd say that there is a decent amount of player action, as there is contention in the actions you are able to take, but the lack of available actions and general tightness in the game adds just a little too much frustration to make for a delightfully fun game.  Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable challenge.

I tried.  My wife loves the animeeples.  I won the majority of games we played, but where is the fun?  God, this designer puts out boring titles.  True BGG afficionados eat it up though.  You get into the hobby and you think you need to have this kind of game on your shelf, to show what a sophisicated board gamer you are.  But you don't.  People seem to want to pretend that they are farmers.  Why?  Most restrictive game I have ever played.  Again, why is this fun?  Do yourself a favor.  Go outside and build a fence.  It's more fun and much more thematic.

One of Uwe Rosenberg's masterpieces. A great design. The path to get more workers is unneccesarrily overpowered by also receiving 3 VPs per worker in the end. In the early game, the struggle for wood is quite tough!

RATING: 6.1
The game is undoubtedly very pretty and very playable alas it simply does not provide the level of player interaction or strategy that many of its bedfellows do. It falls well short of both Caylus and Puerto Rico in terms of intensity - there are simply far too many roles available and you rarely feel as if your options are limited. Furthermore the random deal of character cards  is imbalanced, in the last game I played My wife was dealt a hand of characters that were considerably less useful than her opponents and as a result she struggled to get a foothold. I guess my primary complaint is that it feels as if you are playing solo throughout, you would be as well setting up five tables with five different players, the involvement of others really had little bearing on my game. Its nice but could/should be a whole lot better.

Just beginning to scratch the surface of the cards. Card drafting reduces the luck factor, as certain card combos can be too powerful to be simply handed to a player by chance. The scarcity of resources seems perfectly appropriate to the theme, and a source of great tension. You cannot play this game on auto pilot and expect to do well. But most important of all, it's just real FUN to play, quirks and all.

There are too many bad things that can happen on your turn.  Then by the time you are able to set up a few things, the game ends.  Having to settle for the less optimum move due to a little mistake is one thing, but why punish the person for it as well?

Wow, what an overrated game. I won't say I'll never play this again, but I find playing it to be a poor use of my time.

This game is a Euro fan's dream and an Ameritrasher's nightmare. It's even worse than Puerto Rico for scripting. The "replayability" of the giant card decks is pretty much a joke.

I know people who love to play this game over and over again and love to play the exact same way every single time. I'm also glad I'm not them.

Playing Agricola is a tough task. Because it just vividly refelcts our life: struggling for the next meal.
Besides, it also teaches us to make right decisions when facing so many choices ahead.
A greeeeeeat game! You must play it!

RATING: 7
Agricola is a good game with lots of tension, and it feels satisfying in the end, win or lose. Initially players barely eek out subsistence food production, but eventually farms generate surpluses, and just as things begin to come together, the game ends. It feels like a farming game in the best possible way. 

This is my favourite worker placement game because unlike so many others, every player's actions deeply impact everyone else. Other players' choices matter, and that's because everyone needs to do more or less the same thing. Shrewd tactical moves can and do win the game. I rarely find myself requesting to play Agricola, but I always enjoy myself when I do. I only wish setup and upkeep weren't so daunting. I'd play it much more often but for all the overhead.

So that's my defence of the game.  I could also say that Agricola has many things I don't like in games.  Worker placement, individual player boards, and scripted strategies are all here and they are all negatives.  Yet Agricola stubbornly remains a game I enjoy playing.  In an alternate universe it would be one of only a handful of games of its type.  In that world, I might not be so hostile to the genre Agricola represents.  I would simply play Agricola and I would be happy.  Alas, I do not live in that world.  But when I play Agricola, I imagine that I do, and I'm happy.

We have the Z-man edition with animeeples and Z-deck! - We both like the replayability and variety given by the many cards. The main strategy appears to be making best use of the cards to maximise downstream generation of resources while minimising their cost. The interaction is great without being nasty in that you can easily adapt a strategy when a favoured action is taken by someone else. Good fun & that's the whole point.

This was a great game, although longer than advertised.  If every one knew the game, it could go fast, but because of the large number of choices, it wasn't always easy to pre-plan your move.  I love the replayability, but it didn't always seem cards were in balance.  I need to play more to decide that.  I much prefer this to Caylus, as you have control of some of the game and make your own path.  I'm looking forward to more plays.  After 2nd play, I was more eager to play again, and am still playing many playes later..  It played as well with 2 as it did with 5.

A very dense worker placement. Can be a bit punishing when you are forced to feed your family constantly, but I think that adds to the competitiveness and stress of the game. This is the game to try once you are ready to move up from things like Stone Age and Waterdeep. I hear Caverna is a better version of this, but I have yet to give it a play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Despite a lot of opinion to the contrary I think Agricola is a fairly simple game.  The huge numbers of occupation and improvement cards can make things look much more complicated than they really are.

The game itself is a pretty straightforward worker placement game and the cards mentioned above really just add some spice and freshenss to what could become a repetitive format otherwise.  They do, however, ensure that the game changes enough with each play to remain enticing.

When I first got Agricola I played it so often that I got a bit sick of it.  But after a break of a year or so I have come back to it and enjoy it as much as ever.

After second game:

Played with Doron, Guy, Nir and Hila.
I won with 40 pts with the Well, Water Fetcher, 4 people and stone house.
Nir got to 2nd place of 38 with his huge grain farms... Guy blasted with the BusinessMan that gives a free occupation and improvement, but did not score as well. Doron did not succeed this game at all.

Hard and smart game, need to play by the cards you are dealt with.

Very surprising that we played for 6 hours straight and it was tense and focused the whole time. You are very engaged when its not your turn because you need to see which actions other players are taking. When not, you are thinking hard about how to achieve your next goal in the strategy.

Its massively repayable as each game everyone have completely different set of 14 unique cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's a cool game! You have to figure out how to make the cards you were dealt work for you. It's a bit like Caylus (assign workers to different jobs, develop an economy) but better: simpler development of worker buildings/actions but much more variety in modifiers via the hundreds of cards. The first game is tough, although not as bad as Antiquity.

BUT it's not as cool as all the hype! Good, not great -- I prefer Le Havre!

I can't get into this game and have no desire to play. And yes, I've played the physical copy a couple of times. I even bought the app so that I could learn to play & try to appreciate the game on my own time It's so highly praised on BGG, how could I be wrong? Alas, I can't even make it through the tutorial (which I've attempted to get through multiple times) without being bored out of my mind and wanting to move on to something else. Mechanics? Solid. Theme? "meh". Theme integrated into the game mechanics? Fail.

I like the variability of the game with the starting cards.

RATING: 6.5
Right... so Agricola really should have been two separate releases: the family game, and the expansion.  I'd probably rate the former a 6 or a 7, and the latter an 8.5

As it stands, this is NOT a gateway game as so many seem to say.  It's too big, too unwieldly, too costly, and too varied.  The rulebook is pretty crap, with no pictures of how to actually lay out the board and get ready to play, something that non-euro-afficianados would find very offputting to say the least.

Having said all this... excellent, excellent game with tons of replayability.  It oozes theme, is a blast to play, and is a satisfying solitaire experience to boot.  Can't say it's my favourite game at this point, but it's in my top ten for now.

Edit:  Revised down to a solid 8.  Look, it's a good game, a fun game, well designed with a lot going on.  But it's definitely not a 10 or even a 9 for me.  Too much setup for too little pay off.  I guess maybe if I felt inclined to play it 4 or 5 times back to back, or had the space to leave it set up, maybe I'd feel a bit differently.  I doubt it.

Edit2 June 30th, 2009:  Revised down to a 6.  I am just not inclined to play Agricola anymore.  Again, too much setup for too little payoff, that holds true for sure.  But the gameplay itself is just lacking... the game gets interesting just as it ends, and there's a chance -- a good one in fact -- that the card draws can make for a tedious game for one player or, worse yet, many players.  At this point I feel quite strongly that Agricola is very overrated.  It is a grab bag of ideas that don't quite mesh together.

Edit3 Jan 26th, 2009:  I had upped it to a stable 6.5 months and months ago, forgot to make note of it here.  Can't see the 6.5 changing.  I enjoy it well enough, and it's the favourite games of one of my favourite gamers, so it hits the table more of often than *I* would choose, but meh, that's fine by me.  And I'm not sure where I got "oozes theme" from -- maybe it was the catchphrase of the day.  Really, the theme is there, but not particularly strong or anything, especially many of the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Still fun to play, but I have a couple issues with the game.  Most importantly, amongst experienced players, it seems to boil down to who draws the most powerful improvement and occupation cards.  Also, less importantly, the scoring seems tacked on, where you are penalized if you don't have at least one of eveything on your farm.  Perhaps that's a nod to diversification, but really why does it matter if you specialize in herding sheep and don't have any wild boar?  I still enjoy playing it occasionally but I won't request it either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I LOVE THIS GAME!  The only thing I'm worried about is my game group being a little off-put by the number of rules and amount of strategy involved with this game that they won't want to always play it like I do.

The best part is the randomization of the action order, occupations, and minor improvements and the amount to choose from.  This keeps the game from getting stale like many other worker placement games without as dynamic a setup.  The ever-changing combinations give this game an insane amount of replay value.

It is designed to scale from 2-5 players which keeps the game balanced and just as fun no matter the number of people playing.  And if you ever do manage to get bored with the base game there are several inexpensive expansion card decks (and a full-fledged expansion) to give it a shot in the arm.

The only criticism I would give it is that with the number of different moves and paths to victory across 14 rounds and variability of the games even experienced players can find themselves taking an overlong time planning out their strategy on their turn which can introduce quite a bit of down time and long games.  This comes hand in hand with any game with this much variety though and I'll always side with variety and replayability.

Surprisingly bad rulebook but online tutorials fill the gap.

My first expensive BGG ratings mistake. This was near #1 when I bought it, and I thought that meant it would be fun. 

I couldn't get it into my head before I bought it that it was about farming. It is always about farming. There is nothing more to it than building a farm. I guess some people get really into crunching the numbers or making the most efficient farm possible but in the end its a big heavy game with a lot of fiddly bits that... let you build a farm. I got ACBaS and that is enough for us. Sold.

Played with 3 players, family version. I liked the game but I didn't find it superb or even more than just good +.

It didn't grab me that much but I do have to play the expanded version. Or maybe that's what I don't like the game - the millions of possibilities.

18/07/08
Played again with 4 players and the Minor and Occupation cards were used. This is one of those cases where I will have to learn so much more about the game before actually like it. It's not intuitive at all for me because it has no rules at all. Everything is a tweak in this game. Instead of the game having a tweak it is the tweak itself that has a game on it. Cards and more cards make it different everytime, and that's a bless for card lovers but not for me. It is a good game though and I would like it more in the future I'm sure of that.

19/07/08
Tried the solo variant. It's not very difficult to get the 50 points. It's challenging enough but not that difficult. I've rather found it a good way to start dealing with the cards and the best way to learn how to maximize your production. I think I can play this game 20 times before opening another deck!

19/07/08
Played with 3 players.
I know the game better and it makes me like it more because of that. I still think that Agricola needs lots of experience to be enjoyed properly. One of the great things about it is that it goes very well with the 3 fromats I've tried so far: 4, 3 and 1 player.

21/07/08
Played another solo game and changing my opinion about not being hard. The first time I played it alone I made a big mistake by feeding the family with only 2 food instead of three and that makes total difference between an easier game and a much more difficult and challenging one.

Been playing many games so far with 4 and especially 3 players. I think that one of the good things this game has is how to maximize your production with your cards. It's great to watch a bad hand turn into something good or acceptable. I don't think I will ever raise the rate of this game not because I don't like enough for that but because sometimes your cards are so bad that the most you can achieve comparing to others is a family style of game, without anything really helpful to do with them. This wasn't that bad if the other players had exactly the same amount of luck but if they don't it's very hard for me to compete with such a difference between hands.

Sumarizing I don't like the gap of luck that often occurs between players. It would be chalenging enough if playing the solo version but very frustrating when having to compete with others with plenty of luck and everything simplified or actually useful.

After more than 30 plays I still like to play it. I think it's very unbalanced but since it only takes about 70/90 minutes to play it's a good option.

After three plays with English text:  I love this game!  It seems like you could play this game the rest of your life and never play the same exact game twice.  Each decision is important.  

Lots of German text on card.  It's difficult to play if you don't speak German.  I had the English/German glossary and it doesn't really help you with all the words on there and some of the intricacies on the cards (like it can only be used once or twice or when someone else plays a card, etc.)

Really good fun - but can feel like hard work sometimes (in a good way) - still tons more to discover; have just started exploring the I deck... Like it solo too.
EDIT: A year on, and sometimes it feels like work in a BAD way! Too tense and difficult sometimes, and this has been superceded by Le Havre, where there are always more options for something useful to do.

Pimped it out with ani- and vegi-meeples, and farmer sets, and it looks great. :o)

Must try Liz on this again with more 3p or 4p actions available in a 2p game...? Hmmm...


[update April '11] - At Edinburgh League of Gamers recently, I had a 5 player game of this with the Interactive deck - IT WAS BRILLIANT! If every game was like that, I'd rate this a 10; however, I've also played 3 player games that lasted way longer than that 5p game, and if every game was like that, this'd be rated a 4. So, Swings and Roundabouts, and I'll leave it at an 8 for now.

[update Aug. 2016] - have played this a few times solo and with the family, and it still stands up as an absolute cracker. I'm taking the Feb 2011 score of an 8 up to a 9.

My review

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/330615

Amazing - theme, tremendous depth and breadth, scalable by complexity and number of players, and Mrs Sorp likes it (family game). My only (minor) niggle is that the component quality (yes there are lots of them!)is not reflected in the price - after 6 plays 1 tile and 1 card showing wear and tear. The theme validates the complex options, encourages me to think about how i can make my family survive and prosper - the necessity to feed your family and expand your farm is compelling and something that everyone can relate to. 6 games in and i have only scraped the surface of Agricola. Uprated  after 5 player game at Swiggers - game just gets better and better. The best board game game i have played. The translations of the occupations is a second minor niggle.

I now have a major niggle - the game is so good i have less desire to play the rest of my collection.

I love the fact that it never seems to play the same way twice, that focusing too much on card synergies can result in ignoring the table and your opponents. 

49th and 50th games in quick succession after a 3 month Le Havre induced hiatus. Just as great as i remembered - seeing new things. Looking forward to my 100th play

80th play -seeing this as a path game with very minor diversions that get you one more, or one earlier. But in  Not sure if this is genius or I should find it monotonous. It still creates a fear of feeding and failure.

Rosenberg takes a giant leap in game design, congratulations!  Excellent building game with just the right amount of interaction.  The building is satisfying, the choices are good, you'll never be able to do all you want but it's okay.  A few of the cards seem a little unbalanced, but that's very minor.  It feels in spirit closer to Roads & Boats than to anything else I know, but the mechanics are nothing like Roads & Boats.  Very engrossing game.

I've enjoyed playing the solo game series for this. I have to admit that it can be disastrous to try to do in a multiplayer game what you do in a solo game. All in all, a very good game, but takes a while to set up. Restocking can be time consuming. This might be one of those games where if you are losing, you spend the entire time losing. I'll have to play more to see.

Was fun at first, would have rated 7. But on the third play I got into really bad luck and wasn't able to work myself up again by any means. Result I lost with 18 negative Points. So frustrating! "Do everything, otherwise you're doomed." Not my type of game. You're family is starving. And starving. And starving. But they don't die. You can't just concentrate on some things. I unterstand monocropping is bad, but getting negatives for every thing you don't do (when actually sometimes you simply cannot do, because somebody is blocking you) is just too much.

I've played 3 games now, One 4 player, one three player and one 2 player game. The 4 player game went great, everyone really enjoyed it. The 3 wasn't so good as one of the players wasn't really a gamer. I think the 2 player game could be cool, but my opponent tried a path too far off the beaten trail. (Concentrated too much on one, ignored almost everything.)

I'm looking forward to trying the I & K & Z decks soon.

I have just played this twice with two players, but so far I'm underwhelmed. First play was family version, and the second was the normal game but with only basic cards.

I know I focused way too much on Occupations and Minor Improvements in the second game, and I realise that those can be really powerful if played at a better chosen time, instead of just "as many as possible", but I still had the feeling that they didn't add that much to the game.

The game actually feels very light to me, which was surprising, given people's general flaunting of it as a "heavy euro". It feels to me like I can get the same amount, or more, of strategic thinking with a lot less setup time from other games, and with the same amount of setup, Trickerion will give me way more strategy…

This is kinda cute, and somewhat interesting. But number 1? It's a math game...about farming. Very odd.

Family game works fine, I have no problem with it compared to the card driven normal game. When you know everyones options it actually becomes more cut-throat, so it feels like the family game opens for more screwage than otherwise!

The rule book is horrible for learning the game. Ugh! Bad bad designers. Where is the layout explained? Anyway, after getting through the first game you find that this actually plays quickly, but is prone to AP. So if you have an AP-prone player, don't play this with them.

I don't think this is solitaire. I plan all my moves depending on what the others will and want to do. It might become more like solitaire with the cards, as more options are viable to more people, but I have to play more to judge this properly.

I will probably never suggest this with my regular gaming group, there just are better games that interest us more. I will play this with my SO, and try to sell it to a few other non-regular gamers that we meet up with.

UPDATE:

8 games played. Rating lowered from 6 to 5. Nothing has changed, it's a math game.

I'm a bit conflicted on this one. On the one hand, I really enjoy playing this and look forward to explore all the different decks (I've only played with the E-deck yet). But apart from the replayability because of the sheer number of cards, Agricola can hardly be called spectacular. Strip them away, and it's just a decent, probably even good worker placement tile. 
In the end, what saves Agricola is the experience it offers. You can get a lot of enjoyment from this game just trying to achieve your own goals, without worrying too much about your final score.

Initial Impressions:
Bits: Nice bits but the gem is that it ships with enough baggies to separate everything. you don't HAVE to buy a Plano box ( but you will ). The boards are nicely layed out and abit ingenious on how they fit learning rules on one side. 
Test Play: Did a test play using Family rules. I was impressed, it played very well and kept my interest. The solo game really moves along so you don't feel slowed down. Def +1 that solo works well.

Nice storytelling, great game-concepts and a high replay-value. The huge number of cards to start with (you are randomly dealt 14 out of a few hundred unique cards) makes every game unique. It's rather difficult to keep an eye on your contrahent's plans and ressources, but that's not a flaw at all.

Very flexible - the game plays different with 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 players and works wonderful in every constellation. Even more - you can easily adjust the level of complexity and thus play the game with casual gamers. 

Definitely one of the best games I've ever played.

Wow!  This is a very fulfilling game.  There is persistent turn angst throughout, as you want to either perform more actions than is possible, or your actions of choice are taken by your opponents.  You've got to constantly work out plans B and C throughout the game.  I feel pretty good when I finally accomplish the task of getting certain occupation cards onto the table, but you cannot make this your sole focus else you will most likely miss scoring points in several areas.  This game is all about the journey; enjoy the ride!

Most of the people in my group (or at least the loudest) prefer to play without the cards, so I guess I'm kind of missing the point of the game. But the single game I've played with one of the decks, one player was dealt an extremely favourable hand of cards, which pretty much won the game for him, so I guess there's a chance that they're on to something.

Fantastically fiddly farming fun. Agricola overwhelms players who worry too much about considering every angle. It delights in spoiling plans and forcing unexpected choices. It is filled with more options than you could ever hope to sample. The sheer number of choices and components might cause some to shy away but if you play through to the end you can look back and realize there was some decided strategy and certain choices that defined your outcome. And it's fun to make a little farm out of all those pieces.

Mayfair edition with animeeples
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's one of my favorites, and the replay-ability is very high due to the random occupations and minor improvements you get each game.  Since occupations and minor improvements are so important, we just started using the mulligan rule where before we start you can trade your 7 starting cards in for 6 new ones, and then if you want trade those 6 in for 5 new ones, etc - this has worked out very well and keeps the game from sucking if someone gets cards that they dont think they can use.
I'd say the game is mildly interactive, the main interaction being the shared resources in the middle, but usually everyone can get what they want so it plays very socially.  I like this game best with 3 players.  We played with 5 once and it was awfully slow.  Playing with 4 is neat to see the 4-player occupations though.
This game has been getting less play time lately I think due to the amount of pieces we have to deal with.

RATING: 6
At first play, I was underwhelmed by this game. After seeing numerous board game reviewers tout this game as a top worker placement, I was excited to give it a try.  However, I felt like there were a lot of options for development that were out of reach because I was constantly under threat of not having enough food for the harvest.  As a result, gathering enough food for my workers was always more of a priority over expanding or developing the farmhouse, adding to the family, or using the hand of 14 cards (only two of which actually ended up being used).  Not sure if it was due to inexperience resulting in not optimizing resources, but I expected my farm to become an engine to help me get further in the game, but never felt like it did.  I won 25-17, but not sure I would come back to this game.  I guess my problem with this game is that unlike other worker-placement games, it never felt like I had interesting placement choices to make; there was always something that I absolutely had to accomplish each turn, so placement was a foregone conclusion, as long as I wasn't blocked by the other players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome placement game.  It's a game where you want to do everything but every game will hand you an unique situation that will challenge us develop our farm while we need to be sure to feed our people at the same time.  Every game offer different twist in the game playing - that is what make this game a replay able game.

RATING: 6
This is a relatively fun game hampered by an all-too frequent break by the cards.  If you have experienced players, it often happens that one player out 4 or 5 will get a poor draw for occupations and minor improvements.  This will not guarantee a loss because you can always alter your strategy, but you cannot win--at that point you're playing to not be last.  Similarly all too often one player will get a couple stellar combos in the occ/impr cards which, if played well is nearly impossible to beat.

A big part of this problem lies in the fact that the game has only a little direct player-interaction--almost always unintentional.  Intentionally trying to foil another's plans will typically hurt both players--because playing to slow another's progress means you're usually wasting an opportunity to pursue your own most advantageous route.

The game only truly shines when you get the rare situation when no single person is overly hurt nor helped by their cards, but rather everyone must work to find their winning strategy.

The game also has a fairly significant set up time (or take down time) to get all the cards and bits sorted out prior to play--a particular problem if you play with many different numbers of people since you use different card sets depending on how many people are playing.

All that said, though, it is a reasonably entertaining game due to the number of cards, and the fact that you see so few during any one game.  It also plays pretty quickly which is neat considering how much can be going on.

Truly I cannot believe how many people swoon over this one, but hey, as long as their enjoying it (and not making me play every week!).  Wanting to play it all the time, naah, personally I even took it off my want in trade list.

Lowering to a 6.  This is nothing more than a VERY simplistic game of engine-optimization with (thankfully) widely varied starting conditions.  Want to see how poor a game this is?  Play with the same cards for 3 games...yuck.  The cards keep it interesting enough that I will play with 4.  But I won't play with 2 or 3, and have to be convinced with 5.  I'm blown away with the fact that this remains at number 1.

I love the Farmers Of The Moor expansion! It really makes this game more pleasant. But hold on! This is a comment about the main game. Well the main game is good too, but with the expansion is much better.

The only thing I HATE about this game is there are TOO much cards! Which means not all the cards are usefull, which means there is too much luck involved on what cards you might get, which means that in hard game like Agricola, this can become very frustrating.

Rated as a solo and 2-player game.

There's just something very satisfying about creating your own self-sustaining farm, even if the animals do look suspiciously like cubes.

Tense decision-making, tight resource management, and multiple strategies, combined with the replayability inherent in the card decks make this a solid 9 for me. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the lack of true win/loss conditions for the solo game. Counting up points at the end is a bit anticlimactic compared to, say, saving the world from disease. Still, it's the kind of game that makes me wake up in the middle of the night thinking, "THAT'S what I should have done!"

I like Agricola ok, but it feels like you are just filling in a spreadsheet for the most part. The special cards in your hand may help your decisions, but there really is only one ideal way to play them to score your highest. In other words there are two paths to victory, the one that nets you the most points, or the one that screws your neighbor out of points. I don't like games where your best option is to play sub-optimally in order to win. The game and components are also way too fiddly for what you get out of it. I'd rank it lower but during play it does allow you enough thought to keep it interesting, but it's not nearly as interesting as the BGG rating implies.

Well look at that, I actually played the #1 game of all time (having never played "Puerto Rico")!  But I've only played it once (with the basic set of cards) so BE FOREWARNED: this is a "first impressions" rating.  "Agricola" very much falls within the "Euro-style" camp of board games, and at first glance doesn't seem to bring anything particularly revolutionary to the genre.  I do like that game play seems fairly open-ended with multiple paths that can be taken, yet the game doesn't allow you to pursue only one or two paths exclusively, and you definitely need to do a few things early in the game in order to make sure your family doesn't starve later (an aspect that reminded me of "In the Shadow of the Emperor", a game I didn't particularly enjoy).  So while the options SEEM to be plentiful, the optimal strategy (at least with the simple version of the game) might perhaps be more scripted than it first appears.  The game components are fairly nice, although the poor graphic design on some of the cards diminishes the ease with which information can be gathered at a glance, and those generic wooden cubes are fairly uninspiring (it's all about the animeeples baby!).  But all in all, I did enjoy playing this and would definitely try it again.  However, I'm realizing more and more that these "meatier" Euro-style games aren't really my cup of tea.  And one thing seems clear from all those Fimo farmers and animeeples: fans of Euro-style games secretly DO love chrome and want to be immersed in theme too!  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

I like it that the basic game WITHOUT the cards is so darned good, and I like the fact that for the players who want all these "extra power" factors in their rules, the cards were included with the game in the first place instead of putting people through the crap of having to buy an "expansion."  I've played this fifteen times (always with at least three players, about six of the times without any cards) and am looking forward to many more.  The game has a nice flow and a tricky ending.

Replayability is very high thanks to the cards.  The free-form player card is very cool and leads to great "I created this from scratch" satisfaction at the end.

This game was boring and relatively uninteresting thematically. It's very easy to fall behind early, and extremely difficult to come back once you do, so I didn't feel the play was dynamic. It's like, Great, we're farming, and oh, great, I thought my farm was doing okay, but your farm is totally kicking my farm's butt and there's absolutely nothing I can do to close the gap, and we've still got an hour left in this game. No thanks.

I have to rate this game a 10, simply for the many hours of quality gaming that it has offered me and for the potential to offer me loads more.

For me the main advantages are: 1) The subtle but very rich player interaction: the game will not actively push you towards this direction, but you cannot win without studying what your opponents are doing. Plus, whether you understand it or not, most of your moves will affect most of the other players as well. 2) The balance between the strategic and tactical elements: it is equally important to have a plan for the whole game and to make on-the-fly/opportunistic decisions that might not be serving your general plan. Be too heavy on the strategy OR on the tactics and you will lose. 3) Replayability: The set of cards that you are dealt/you draft, as well as the orientation of your opponents make each game different.

It is certainly not a game to socialize over, or to bond with friends through playing. Play Agricola if board gaming is the reason you met with your friends, not as a light "background enrichment" to your socializing. Most of the critique about this game comes from this fact - and it is reasonable if you are tricked into thinking that Agricola is something that it's not.

Partly the reason i got into BGG as it was the first game i ever preordered.
Very nice Euro with lots of options and tons of cards which add replayability and make sessions different.

Many people think it is too tight but i find it nice.

I wish i could play it more but my gamer friends seem to not like it that much.

27/5/2013: It was the game of the month for May 2013 and we did play it a lot and had a great time. Rating increased to 9.
Previous rating:8

Only problem i find so far is that there are some very weak cards and some broken ones. Especially the weak ones should be a bit better.

To mitigate the effects of luck and make Agricola more strategic, we always use the draft variant at game start.

Another optimization game, yet smells fresh and have so much options that it will be played a lot. Very good gameplay, very good components, very good graphic design.
Many options are good, although random workers and exapansions adds a lot of chaos. Unfortunately after many plays game becomes repetitive and winning requires set of typical opening moves. Winning with with experienced Agricola players is almost immposible. Something — don't know what — maybe feeding, maybe almost mandatory growth of family or almost required opening moves pushes me off this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Played it twice so far, and I'm loving it.  For a game that is slightly longer than the average Euro, it sure flies by faster than any game I can think of.  It's the impending harvests and the fact that it is hard to get done even close to everything you want to do.  The game mechanics are far superior to any worker placement game I've played (Caylus, Pillars, Stone Age, AoE3, Tribune, etc.)  I really like that the game asks you to be good at everything, considering most other games seems to be about specializing.

And the cards!  Every game seems like it will be solidly different, giving this game much more replay value than most games of it's kind.  I'm really looking forward to many more plays, hence the current 10.

Down to 9.5 due to length.

RATING: 7.5
Generally play solo, or with 2. The solitaire game is great for determining the best way to use the cards available to you, but is overly predictable. Still a good min/maxing exercise if I'm looking for a brain exercise.

2 player is subject to a little bit of take-that to block the moves of the opponent if blocking their move yields a bigger differential than a move that's beneficial for you. Additionally, randomness of the improvements/occupations, and the balance of power between cards adds some luck to the game. May try to do drafting to make the game feel more controlled.

Have only played 1 game with 4, two of the players were new. One player had many cards which made fishing a very strong spot, but due to inexperience couldn't fully utilize it. The game seems to shine at 3+, and I look forward to playing more at those counts.

A Eurogame with theme play!  Fairly easy to learn but it will take a few games to develop strategies.  Game play offers many choices, but minimal player interaction.  The components are very good - colorful mounted boards, wood playing pieces, and  somewhat durable cards with fair artwork.  Rulebook is well written with examples and in color.  Game length is too long with many players.

RATING: 7
I tend to miss the boat on the hot new games when they first come out, mostly because my game-playing opportunities are pretty sporadic, and I don't have a dedicated group of well-heeled people who buy everything as it comes out! So I tend to get exposed to the really popular games long after most other people. Thus, May 2010 was my first exposure to Agricola.

A few of the other players were experienced with the game, but there were a couple others will only a game or two under their belt, so I felt I wasn't at too much of a deficit.

I followed the rule explanation well enough, and was able to play along without making a complete fool of myself (I lost, of course).

Honestly, this game didn't do a whole lot for me. I'd love to articulate exactly what I disliked about Agricola. I played this the same day I played Airships (see above), and while that game stuck with me, my memory of Agricola has faded over time - a good sign of a "meh" reaction. I would probably play it again if an opportunity arose, but I doubt I would ever suggest getting it out myself.

NOTE: I realized later that my first play was a "family" game. My second play was the full game (quite a while later) and I enjoyed it a lot more. Now I am much more interested in playing again.

[several plays] I think I have always played with all cards. I also GM'ed this game one time at a CON.  It is a good solid game, but it has not replaced my all-time favorites yet.  I love the farming theme, the scoring system, and core gameplay.  Always my favorite type of games are about resource management.  However, some there is always some complaints about the balance of the initial hand of cards, and the game seems to lack the intensity and variety of viable strategies of Caylus.  I think Caylus might still be my favorite game of this "type".  I have not tried "drafting" the initial cards, that might improve that aspect for me.

RATING: 7.5
[Z-man 08 edition w/ Z-deck, animeeples, resourcemeeples and vegimeeples] {Agriculture; action-drafting, variable-player-order, action-point, development, resources management; solo, scalable} {Family version 6.5; E-deck 7.5; I-Deck 7.5} Agricola is a decent Euro game.  It's thematic and highly replayable.  It's highly interactive and players have to strongly compete for resources; esp. with K-deck.  It's multifaceted: there are multiple paths to get victory points.  However, a strategy is highly dominated by the initial hand and players don't have much flexibility to adjust their strategy in the game.  The decisions are meaty yet not taxing.  It's fun to play Agricola because it's tense and engaging.  And, it's fun to see how your farmyard is developed at the end of the game.

The normal version is more suitable for experienced players.  It needs some time to teach the rule in detail.  For beginners, the family version would be better, though less fun.  It is easier to learn the game through family version.

The game experience is highly influenced by the card deck.  I select card decks depending on the players.  For general players, I would select E deck.  For most gamers, I would select I deck.  For very experienced players, I would select either I / K deck.  Z-deck could be occasionally used but X-deck and L-deck are only for fun.

The components are great, esp. with Animeeples and Vegimeeples.  The card illustration is colorful and cute.  However, non-English speaking players have a hard time to understand the cards.

[Animeeples] The animals are cute.  I esp. like the sheep.  They add much to game experiences.
[Vegimeeples] They add much to game experiences.  I like the large grains.
[Resourceemples] They increase game experiences, but not as much as Animeepls and Vegimeeples (personal taste).  I wish there were more tokens in the bag.

OMG, I love it.  First, it is a snowball or engine building game and that is my favorite kind.  Second, I was able to play through a 2-player game in an hour.  (More players might add about 15 minutes per player).  Third, the game offers a ton of variability.  For a more family friendly game, there are rules that do not use any of the extra cards, just the actions that get revealed each round.  Then, if you do play with the cards they are split into three decks that offer different levels of interaction, conflict, and difficulty.  Finally, there is enough of each kind of card that we were able to play two full games and not reuse any of the cards that we had seen in the first game.  This game has replay value out the whazoo (in other words, a lot).  Now I just have to beg that please, please, please there needs to be an English edition.

RATING: 6.5
Why is this so enjoyable?  No idea.  But it -is-.  At its base, its mechanics are similar to Caylus (send your workers to certain squares to get certain resources to earn points at the end of the game), but it avoids many of the things about Caylus that I find unenjoyable.

The card decks and semi-random distribution of when actions will be available give a nice sense of randomness without making the game entirely luck-based; basically, you will have a random hand at the beginning that will help guide your strategy, and you will know when most actions will be available, give or take a round or two (but, oh, that give or take can cause so much trouble!). 

The scoring rewards having some amount of balance and not totally over-specializing in one section of the game; you need to get at least one of most things to score competitively.

Somehow, despite the many decisions to be made, Agricola doesn't inspire the stiflingly bad analysis paralysis that Caylus seems to carry like a virus.  This is probably because you get the resources for a worker as soon as that worker is played, so you don't have to keep reviewing what you WILL be getting and WHEN to make sure you can do action X at the right time.

I haven't played it enough to decide whether its rating will bump up, but right now it's very enjoyable and something I am looking forward to playing again. 

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: While a couple of the resources are close in color, it's one of those games where this isn't a terribly big deal, and everything's always in the open, so you can just ask other people around the table which is which if needbe.  All resource symbols on hidden cards also have a drawing of the resource so being able to distinguish the color is unnecessary.

RATING: N/A
I giocatori iniziano con una coppia di contadini in una capanna di legno di due stanza. Ogni turno, ogni membro di questa famiglia può compiere un'azione. Se raccolgono legno e canne, potranno allargare la propria capanna e poi far crescere la propria famiglia. La crescita della Famiglia dà  la possibilità  di scegliere più azioni, ma ha lo svantaggio che richiede più cibo per il suo mantenimento. Per ottenere cibo, i giocatori arano i campi e seminano. Il grano e gli ortaggi seminati vengono raccolti durante il Raccolto, quando anche gli animali si riproducono. Per far allevare gli animali, bisogna recintare dei pascoli per contenere le pecore, i cinghiali e il bestiame. Occupazioni e miglioramenti assicurano il mantenimento della famiglia. Ognuna di queste carte dà  un piccolo vantaggio nel gioco.

Per guadagnare altri Punti Vittoria, i giocatori possono trasformare le proprie capanne di legno in Argilla, e in seguito persino in Pietra. Ma tutto ciò che ha a che fare con bilanciare le necessità  di cibo, o che può rendere la vita di tutti i giorni più confortevole può far guadagnare Punti Vittoria, soprattutto la Crescita della Famiglia. Userete ogni volta una diversa selezione delle 166 carte Occupazione o dei Miglioramenti, quindi ogni partita sarà  diversa. Regole aggiuntive per il gioco in solitario e una versione accorciata per famiglie fanno in modo da fornire una sfida di livello adeguato per ogni tipo di giocatore.

Harsh, competitive, deep and silky smooth. The only thing keeping it away from 10, for me, is the amount of stuff you gotta pick up and place on the board after every round which can be pretty tedious.

Having your own board that slowly turns into a thriving farm is REALLY satisfying, and being able to glance over at other people and see how they are doing just by the state of their farm is great. One of my favourite games!

Great game!

Our new favorite. It has been the only game we have played since we acquired it, and we have played it a lot. She constantly requests it which is a huge plus.

 
Tight gameplay, great mechanics, fantastic theme, very strategic and tactical, many paths to victory, highly variable with the many Occupation and Minor Improvement cards, and plays in a good amount of time (with two).

BGG was right about this one and it deserves its high ranking. We've only played it with two, but really want to play with more.
 

UPDATE: Alright, Agricola is amazing. Really, truly an amazing game. Love it! Moves from 8 to 9. (I am sure it will move to a 10 once we get a chance to play it with higher player counts)

Magic the Gathering meets Puerto Rico. I like to draft the Ausbildungen and Anschaffungen at the start of the game: you get dealt 7 Ausbildungen, pick one of them and pass the remaining 6 players to the player to your left. Repeat this until all cards have been chosen. This helps to assure that every players gets something playable for the crucial early turns. Highly recommended.

Agricola takes a rather heavy-handed approach at replayability. You start with a standard action-selection game and then you're buried beneath a huge pile of cards from which you're randomly given 14. From these you attempt to carve a successful path. But the replayability is not inherent. In fact, it's forced upon you in a manner that is not entirely satisfying to me. For the replayability to really matter, the underlying game has to be phenomenal. As stated above, it's nothing more than standard. This is opposed to a game like Euphrat & Tigris where the replayability comes from the system itself. Agricola is certainly a solid Euro that I'll happily play, but it seems to have appeared at a time when throngs of geeks are desparate for a new messiah. If this game takes the #1 spot away from Puerto Rico (a game with a *truly* revolutionary idea), it will be a crime.

Played at BGG.con 2008.

Agricola works as a geme it just that for me it suffers the same problem that Calyus does.  The ability to plan out a move is non exixstent in that any plan you set up gets wiped out before you can enact it.  I do not like the mechanic of worker placement that blocks other players for using a building then you have to readjust a plan in the middle of a half round, that kind of tactile stratedgy is very unenjoyable for me (is that a word?!?).  I am a long term planning and enactement kind of guy with the need to adjust your plan when others intervene, not make the best with what you got, kidna guy.

Nice, nice, nice. The multiple paths to victory, the level of turn angst, and the way that no two games will ever be the same make this one excellent game. I don't see how this game won't be getting heavy table time a year from now, or even 5 years from now. And, you can always keep the system fresh by just adding new decks of cards. You really have to give your hand a serious looking over and maximize the interactions of your occupations and improvments. The game requires a very tight mix of strategy and tactics almost like walking a tightrope, or what I imagine it would be like to walk a tightrope at least.

Rating after 12 multi player and 21 single player games.

The single player sequence of 8 games of increasing difficulty is pretty addictive. It's a great way of discovering the various two-player occupations and the minor improvements.

Though it doesn't detract too much from the enjoyment, some of the occupations are clearly overpowered. For instance, having the Lord of the Manor in play every game is an automatic 7 or 8 point bonus without even needing a single action action.

The Quarry minor improvement offers 3 stone with every 'Day Labourer' and by game 4, it can be played immediately in round 1. 

Not for purists (or so I thought) but great fun nevertheless.

>15 plays (family: 2/3/4/5 player; E-deck: 4 player; E/I/K-deck: 4/5 player, E/I/K/Z-deck: 5 player).

If you twisted my arm, I'd say its a mixture of the best bits of Caylus & Antiquity, but the story arc is better defined and on a more human scale: for an hour or two you really feel like a farmer struggling to feed his family and develop his farm.

The one thing I'm not sure about is the cards. Without them (the "family game"), everyone is on a level playing field, I can predict people's actions, and turns move along swiftly. With the cards, asymetries are introduced; player's valuations of good changes. I can't remember all the cards that have been played, so it feels as if there are elements of the game that I'm not factoring in. Downtime is also increased as players read and re-read their cards. On balance, I think I prefer playing without the cards.

Great game. Mostly play 2 player with the wife in a non-cutthroat way. Feels a bit multi-player solitaire but suits us fine.

Dread having to teach this to a new group but happy to play with experienced players. Probably don't rate this higher because it can feel so frustrating to play, never enough time to do what you want etc. Although that does engender a good "one more go" feeling.

RATING: 7
The best thing about Agricola are the components. It does also play well, but I have some problems with it, namely that chance is too big a factor. Sometimes you get cards too good to be true, other times your cards offer no synergies at all, leaving you better off ignoring them.

And while I enjoy complex games Agricola often gives you the feeling that all the time you spent with the setup (which takes forever) and the thinking hard could have been spent much better with a less over the top game.

RATING: 6
(2010-01-21) It's a good, solid Euro with worker placement and resource management. Being as playable for 5 players as for solo makes it handy to have around. Unlike most Euros, it has a solid grasp of its theme and has a good amount of replayability since it has a bunch of variable power cards (occupations and equipment). However the downside there is that those variable cards aren't really balanced so well. You also end up playing the same few strategies each game - it's far from easily solved, but can feel too same-y. It's still probably one of the best engine games around. 

(2016-02-09) So about that replayability. The problem with the occupation and equipment cards is that one player can get a hand with really good synergies and effectively win the game before it starts. So now you spend an extra 20 minutes before the start of the game to draft cards, so now it will invariably be the better card players who get the really good synergies and effectively they win the game before it starts. I guess I don't really want to play a 3h game of Agricola if the meat of the contest occurs during the card draft at the start - I'll just stick to the family game, or better yet just go with Caverna. Sold and rating down to 6.

RATING: 8
Very fiddly, with lots of components going all over the place and cards that are often too complicated.  However, the game play is excellent; there are tons of choices, lots of things to try, and so very few actions to do it all with!  Its an exciting balancing act that moves very fast and taxes the brain quite a bit.  One complaint is that the cards can seem imbalanced.  Really happy to have the English version; its much easier to manage all the cards.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Farming - Worker Placement - 2-5 players - Action Optimisation - Optional Hand Management/Card Drafting - 2-3h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Great game that appeals to (almost) all, made even greater by the addition of the cards.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Outstanding. This game has given me countless hours of fun.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

Agricola is a game that seems to appeal to so many people, it's no coincidence that the game has been #1 on BGG for so long. 

It appeals to people who like the theme, which is almost everybody I know. Something about building up your own farm from scratch is just fun. You can't help but feel pride at your nice house and large family, your fields full of grain and veggies, your fenced in live-stock. For some people, customising their copy is half the fun. And even if you did not actually win the game, you may end up feeling satisfaction at what you accomplished.

But what really makes this game such a winner is 2 things: there's a solid gamer's game underneath the cute theme, and the cards are the cherry on top, making it very replayable, while not upping the luck factor - that is, if you go for the card drafting variant.

One point of criticism: the game is not short and takes a long time to set up and pack away. Using the cards and using the draft variant makes the game better, but also lengthens the game still.

RATING: 9
This is a perfect example of a worker-placement game.  Everything here works perfectly and the game is incredibly tight.  They could realistically change the name of the game to Food because that's what it's all about for the first several rounds.

I think the family game is hardest because you don't get the cards to help you out.

I had this rated a 10 for quite a while.  I do love it, but not quite that much anymore.  Down to a 9 which is still quite awesome.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While somewhat good, I cannot rate it very high because without the expansion, it feels like I'm replaying the same game, even with all the variability and cards, the feeling of the game is too similar from game to game.  I do not like is being forced to build a little of everything to avoid negative points, sometimes I just want to farm and not be a rancher.  As good as this game is, I can only play it once a month or so, sometimes I just want more open choice in a game.

EDIT:  The more I play, the more I hate it.  It ends just as you start to feel you can breath.  I would much rather play a longer game like The Colonists where you really get to build something up instead of trying to cram it all into an hour's worth of play.  It just isn't fun for me.

RATING: 7
Others disput this but it is more of a puzzle than a game. A puzzle with ever changing conditions.
It is a heluva brain ache playing, sometimes fun, sometimes not.
I say it is a puzzle since when you play the one player game it can be more stressful than playing with other people, since every move that is wrong is you own fault.
The game is a farm simulator where you have to get the resources to feed and house your expanding family and farm. Thought the resources are very limited and each player has turn order access to these resources and if what you thought you needed goes elsewhere you than have to change your statergy to maximise your points value.
Deciding on when you take available resources before or after an opponent has a go is the main interaction with other players.
Making a go that penalises another player without it benefitting you in your points hunt is a no-no, since every move must count otherwise you will fall behind.
Some love it. but I will only play it if others ask for it, I never volunteer it as an option to play.
Dont get me wrong it is a brilliant game.

The only reason I don't give this game a ten is just because I'm not a huge fan of the time setting and theme.  I don't mind playing it at all, but if it was more in a type of theme that I enjoy, it's easily a 10.  However, the gameplay itself is a 10.

RATING: 9
Farming themed worker placement Euro. Lots of depth to the gameplay, which provides plenty of replay value thanks to the numerous minor improvement and occupation cards. Found the rulebook very difficult to follow at first (poorly written I felt as it tried to explain the basic and advanced game rules simultaneously). Despite this, it's actually a very simple game to play once you've got the instructions sussed. Virtually every decision you make throughout the game seems to have an affect on the final outcome. Highly recommended.

It's a great game, however, there are other farming games that scratch the itch better for me.  I guess its downfall for me is that if a player doesn't know all the cards the game really slows down.  I just don't have the interest or time to invest in studying the cards.

RATING: 9
Agricola is simply awesome.  I really enjoy the experience.  You have somewhere between 28 and 52 actions (if you some how have three rooms and select family growth in rounds 5, 6 and 7). As a result of the scoring system, you want to do everything but you don't have time.  Plus there's all the tension in the worker placement mechanism that messes with your plans.  It scales well from 1 to 4 and 5 is a little crowded but can be fun too.  The cards add a bunch more actions that you want to do but don't have time for.  I find that the limited actions forces people to generally diverge in strategies (how to gather food and grow family) in the first half of the game and then try to pick up a little bit of the stuff they're missing in the last couple turns to make points.  As a result most farms end up looking similar but arriving there from different paths.  Lots of fun and looking forward to my next game. 
**UPDATE** Appears to scale quite well across the various number of players, each number feeling slightly different.  5 player seems to be pretty tight on actions and a bit more tactical than with less players; 2 player probably being the most strategic.
**UPDATE** Digging deeper into the decks has been fun.  I could see burning out on the single player game; It's fun but pretty dry and a little too easy.  I have called a couple series in the middle when I got a bad hand of minors, didn't play any of them and still busted the 68 point total.  (ie, I could pretty much play each game the same way ignoring the dealt minors and new occupations and still win)  Raising the bar might not work though because it would start to come down to if you drew good occupations and minors or not. Here to stay in my top ten though :) 2009/05/01

Working on a farm for minimum wage is more enjoyable than playing this game.

-ve
1.Worker placement is illogical in a game about running your own farm
2.Everything here is an arbitrary micro-action
3.The scoring system rewards mediocrity
4.Feeding people is tiresome
5.It's fiddly
6.It's overly long
7.There's no positive player interaction.

Honestly the first issue is enough to make me never play this game again but I did play it 4 times because it's well rated. The second also bugs me hugely. 

I could overlook the rest in a good game. This game epitomizes the euro designer disconnect between mechanisms and theme. Normally they have the good grace to abstract things enough that their mechanism choices become irrelevant but not here. No, here the designer randomly abstracts some things and goes into great detail in others. Absolutely bizarre.

Frankly the positives of the game (which are numerous and well covered by others) just don't matter when the core of the game isn't enjoyable.

*I also tried the app on iPhone. Worst experience ever. Don't bother unless you have an iPad.

As a workerplacement game its good but has few things I really dislike about it such as the random unbalanced starting cards in a game otherwise without randomness.
Also feels a bit like the game its playing you since you more or less must do certain things (feedind people/get one of each resource .

Art/components 5/5 for a Eurogame,(only played with veggie meeples edition)

The low rating also has to do with that Caverna is almost the same game but just better in all aspects.

So far the best worker-placement exam I have played.  There are numerous options each turn, and there are plenty of ways to attack your opponent(s) by taking them first.  As many have stated, once you finally feel like things are coming together, the game ends.  

The solo version is quite a fun puzzle.  It is very rewarding when you outdo your previous score.  This boosted my rating from 9.0 to 9.5 originally.

However the set up especially between rounds is a cumbersome pain.  Also, the cards add too much randomness to the game, and if I don't have good cards, I have no hope.  Having now played Caylus, I've dropped this back to 9.0 for those reasons.

Still, I'd play this any time someone suggests it, and I typically lose every game.

This game is like being a farmer getting up before dawn, doing lots of preset chores and working hard, yet still struggling to feed my family and worrying if I am doing enough to expand my farm.  Is this process challenging?  Sure.  Is it FUN??  For me, not so much.  It just feels like so much WORK.  The game also feels too tight and limiting.  Though I do love complex, "thinky" games (which this game is), I prefer them to be more of a sandbox, where I have more creative freedom to evolve my strategy as the game progresses and changes rather than feeling like I'm on a preset path doing X, Y, Z (which is heavily influenced by the cards I receive at the beginning).  The constant pressure of feeding your family (or suffer severe consequences if you fall short) also creates a somewhat annoying tension that adds to this restrictive feeling, like another "to-do" on my list of chores.  Other negatives are the high setup and breakdown time, the many pieces, and the lack of real player interaction beyond the simple blocking/denial of actions.

Fun game to play solitaire. One of the best games to play with your spouse (trust me, little sheeps and building a new room for family expansion somehows triggers something). But at the same time, pretty harsh on your choices so don't mistake it for a 'light' game.

The cards (that come equipped WITH the game) make for nearly endless replayability, and that makes this game a must-have in any collection.

[Edit] Is collecting dust right now because of a) Pandemic has trumped it as 'spouse-game' and b) not playing much solitaire because of so many new games to digest after last year's Essen (+regular buys). Also, Arkham Horror is the solo-choice if enough time. So niche is getting small. Still good game though.

[EDIT AUG 2016] Rediscovered this game after AH turned out to be too big to take on vacation. Still strong after so much time, got a few vacation plays out of it and even managed to play it with my son, who really enjoyed it. Rating revised upwards by 0.5 point.

2 player is my favorite for the speed.  More players is an agonizing experience (still fun with a win!)

update : Has dropped in rating due to non-playing or willingness to deal with the certain people's aggravation while playing.

update : Has crept back in to rotation as we become better gamers.  Solid game but can be annoying some times but I think that is the game.  I would love to play it over and over to get really good at it.  My wife, not so much.  I hate the downtime with 4 players.

update : Agricola has now become a go to in our house.  The pain factor has decreased as the strategy understanding increased.  Play time is fine with 3 players.

CONCEPT: Medieval village farming does not say anything to me. 
MECHANICS.not bad a far as card passing and the like. I cant help but think there are too many decisions in each turn, or else break it up somehow. There is just too many mechanics going on. 
ERGONOMICS. I found the table rather cluttered and it was hard to read the explanation for all those worker placement sites on the board. I would think this would throw off newcomers.
STRATEGIES. There must be some if you know the deck. Not knowing the deck is just stupid.
NARRATIVE. Your pens get bigger and grow carrots there. And a pack of animals only has one baby so...?
DRAMA. It's a point counting exercise so I didnt see any. 
BRAIN ENGAGE. It's interesting I get the feeling women will like this more than men. Perhaps it taps into certain types of thinking like pattern recognition that appeal more.

The rules take a bit of reading and re-reading.  Then you have to play the family version to get the basic mechanics, then read the rules again to ensure you played properly.  Then you can introduce the cards.

I played the game a little wrong the 1st time, not doing the "Start Player" spot correctly, and not adding materials to each spot each turn.

But, once you get the hang of it, it's a good game that adjusts itself nicely from 2 to 5 players.

The only drawback is the large board space needed.

I reviewed a few different strategies, and can agree that this game can be played so many different ways that nobody really can take an advantage playing one way than another.

Very good.  Just can't wait to play with a few friends.

Have been crushed recently playing complex and interactive because of the strictly superior cards of my opponents... Can't decide if I want to play "family" games without cards, or just take my lumps and enjoy the occasional windfall.

Maybe drafting cards?

Probably the 'heaviest' game I have played so far.  I have really enjoyed it.  I love all the components, and the variability.  I enjoy the family game too - I don't see it just as a one-off learning game, there will be plently of times I don't feel like the whole mind-bending 14 card experience.

Very intense resource management game, with lots of flexibility when the Occupations and Minor Improvements are used.   Lots of fun and endless replayability.  You can get carried away with all the options available to you but ultimately you do not want to lose sight of your goal, which is to increase your action limits by adding Family Members.  The Occupations and Minor Improvements will usually factor into that by doing things to help you decrease the amount of time spent on resource management.  It does take a large amount of time to set up (usually 5-10 minutes), however, and a fair amount of time to take down (usually 5 minutes).  We almost always without exception use the Drafting optional rule, so that increases set up time by about another 10 minutes or more but we feel its "oh, so worth it!".

I didn't much like this the first few times I played it, so it stayed unplayed on my shelf for years. Then recently I tried it again two-player, and found it quite intriguing. Listening to the Heavy Cardboard podcast, they said the Farmers of the Moor was mandatory. So I tried with that, and now I'm all over this game. It's gone from a 7 to a 9 for me in short order. After a few more plays, maybe it'll be a 10? Regardless, as a two player game, it works really well.

First game (4 players) left me impressed. A huge amount of information to manage. A lot of options beetween choose and fun. To be played soon...
Second game (5 players) was good but too long. A lot of things to look for and was dfficult to follow my own strategy cause 4 actions before mine were terrible.
Thir game (3 players) was my prefered one! This game rocks!!
After several plays I confirm my opinion.. a TRUE 9!

Played a few games on the Ipad. There's too much information for me. Lots of possible action, all related to each other in an intricate way. I'm just confused while playing this game.

A great game, with a lot of tension at times. The cards give it a ton of variety. Never seems to run too long, in fact, most games you wish you had a few more turns to finish your farm.

This is an instant classic, but I wonder if it has staying power. Still probably one of the best Euros I've played.

A great and exhausting game. However, not the one without flaws. I can tolerate a luck factor from cards (if I don't want it, I just don't use them). But some cards are just too powerful. If one plays them at the right moment, he or she becomes invincible. I love it a lot.

Having come from having played Caverna first, Misery Farm feels a lot more cobbled together. I'm not sure if it was because of expansions or not, but having two rounds of drafting felt a little excessive. I can see wanting to diversify the players with all the jobs and minor upgrades, but why have to go through all that drafting? If someone at the table suffers from AP the game drags on before it even starts.

I'm also not a fan of how the game forces you to develop in certain ways. You can't specialize your plant and animal production. When you do so you effectively lose points for everything you don't have. Also there's a cap on points for everything. You have more than five corn? Too bad, you get max points. At the other end of the spectrum there's begging. If you have to take even one begging card then you're probably not going to win.

For this alone I'd much rather play Caverna, which does give you the ability to specialize and multiple ways to play.

Just the best game. I like it more than all my other games combined. You gotta play with a draft, the draft is amazing and its so fun to try to make combos and deny them from opponents. Plus, it really reduces the randomness in the game to the point where there is just a touch of randomness in Agricola, which is the perfect amount for a game I think. Can't say enough things about this game. I want to start Agricola club--it'd be like Bridge Club, but we'd meet weekly to play Agricola instead

I have a LOT of fun with this. I love the theme, I love the cards and most of all I love the choices! Every single game of this is great fun. Despite having lost very few games vs my family members they always choose this one to play. That is just a testament to how good this game is. To further enhance the experience of playing this game I recommend you watch the tv series "The Colony" and even more so "Victorian Farm" about real-life people attempting to live in the ye old times. Victorian Farm is particularly good as soo many of the things they do and the tools they use are present in Agricola.

I quite like the family version; it makes for a reasonably complex game.

Adding cards tend to make it a bit more complex than the game needs to be and you're basically just playing the cards, not the other players/action spaces.

The card drafting mechanism tends to reduce this.

Overall, it's a good game, just not one I have that much desire to play.

This game just offers me the right kind of worker placement game. There's always tough choices on what to do and each game is different because there's so much choice in the occupations and improvements.

Theme is alright but becomes a lot more fun if you get the animal etc. meeples and get to see how your farm and animals grow throughout the game. Agricola can be a quite demanding game for new gamers but after a few games it offers a splendid experience.

I like Agricola, even a lot in many cases.  I've switched my thinking into only wanting to play it sometimes, and at very certain player counts.  (2 or 3 only)  I think it's fun, but that downtime can be kind of boring sometimes.  Scoring is tricky to explain sometimes.  

Caverna does tweak that, but hits you harder with the AP Proneiness because of the sheer volume of buildings which are always available.  So I still prefer Agricola.  Need to play Farmers on the Moor though.

Surprisingly good despite its lame theme. But getting repetitive now, the cards don't help much. And it really is a multiplayer solitaire even with the I-deck which name is a joke, I really think about something different when I say "interaction".

I like it. It takes a long time to set up and tear down but is worth it. Every game is pretty different.

Lots of replay value.

A much stronger theme than most Euros.  That's part of what pushed my rating up to an 8. The underlying game is excellent too, but I really like a strong theme.

Update: Dropped to a 7 after subsequent plays. Mainly because I realized I would actually turn down a game of this once in a while.

Update 2: Lowered to a 6. I just...need to be in the right mood to play.   I think it's partially because while the theme initially appears to be quite strong, it isn't quite as strong as I thought upon first glance.

RATING: 8.5
Nice worker placement game combining strategic complexity, easy rules and thematic environment.

The family mode, while easy to play, gets too repetitive after three or four games. I don't really like the non-specialization scoring system of the game; it seems there is only one winning path. That mode is ideal to learn the game or play with children, that's all.

Occupations and minor improvements add tones of strategy and replayability, without adding much more rule complexity. Non-specialization is still an issue, but it has cut down. Still, some options don't pay off (like reforming your house before expanding it), which unfortunately limits the available options every turn.

The game can clearly be played with up to 5 players without problems. While the time length increases with the number of players, downtime is not a problem here. Interestingly, the number of players dramatically changes the game options: for instance, with two players you can cook your animals as part of a winning strategy; that's hardly the case with 4 or 5 players. In this way, you have to "learn" the game with the different number of players. That's really nice.

Apart from the already commented non-specialization issue, the game also have a tedious mechanism for increasing the available resources every turn (greatly corrected in Ora et labora). Overall, an excellent game to be played both for hardcore europlayers and casuals.

A nice thing in this game is that even if a player is going to lose, he can still "do things". You're working to get the best farm; even when you're clearly not going to win, you can try to improve yours and have a good time. That means that players with really different skill levels and experience can play and have a good time.

RATING: 10
10 x family version (3x solo)

36 x E Deck (14x solo)

I Deck (15x solo)


The family version is too shematic. Ok with cards someone could have a better draw, but usually better players win, regardless what cards they have. And with cards the game is very interesting. You could play in the same way, but the cards give you a feeling that you play in a diferent way.

The feeding is nice. When you have more family members you have more actions and more points, but more problems at the harvest.

All what you do gives you points, but you must have everything. But when you have everything only at minimum, you want win. You must have something at a big level. And you should try to spare actions (use double action fields). 

The problem is you must make family growth. With only 2 family members you will lose. And wood is a very important resource.

When you pimped your Agricola the game looks very nice.

A pretty good game, but not one that I relish nor look forward to pulling out any time soon---partially because of how little it fires my imagination, and also because so much of it is simply pulling little bits out of bags and moving little bits from one pile of little bits to another pile of little bits.  The rulebook is poorly written---it misses the big pictures while focusing on details in a haphazard order without ever giving a clear view of game play in words or images: I understood how to play only through inference and extrapolations.  Not a lot of personality here, but the sheeples are cute, and it functions well as a component puzzle.

Huh.  To be fair, I have only played the family game version.  But it's a lot of solitaire, because the systems are somewhat forgiving, and the last turn is always a bunch of points-grabbing plays to no other purpose than the game penalizes your lack of this or that.  I'll try it as a full game a few more times to try and suss out the buzz...

15 June 2009: So after receiving Agricola in the Math Trade, I finally play it over the weekend with Cynthia. Turns out that we love it, and have played 3 games in the space of 2 days.

I like its simplicity in the general gameplay (ie. Take actions/stuff, Replenish, Harvest when required), and the complexity that comes from the cards. I think it's a winning mix of mechanics. The Replenishment reminds me a lot of Puerto Rico when you get a lot of coins on a Role and are torn between what you want to do versus picking up all that juicy loot.

The only gripes I have about it: I think it'll suck with 4+ players. I mean, the downtime must be horrendous, and it'll probably be an extremely frustrating game if you're going last or second-last. And I can't figure out why aren't the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards available in a common area like the Major Improvements. I understand the "play optimally with what cards you've got" idea, but that introduces a fair amount of luck in the game when one player gets brilliant cards/card combos and another doesn't. I don't mind it if this was a short card game, but this is a heavy 1+ hour game, and it is frustrating after 1 hour of playing to realise that you didn't have much of a chance of winning because your opponent had super cards that "Plowed 3 fields at once" and "Built 3 additional fences". I'm beginning to lean towards some Card Drafting mechanics as suggested in the BGG forums.

But anyway, as a 2-player game, it's an enjoyable game, and I think we'll get loads of play out of this. Rated 8 with 2-3, rated 6 with 4+.

22 June 09: Played another 2 games with Cynthia over the weekend, and lost both times :-p Looks like its one of those games where I get progressively worse the more I play! Anyway, tried the drafting variant, and found it too tedious. In the end, Cynthia and I preferred to play it with random starting hands. Definitely love the Komplex Deck - such interesting cards!

RATING: 2
A very luck decided game: a good synergistic draw can make the game easy; a poor draw, and you're stuggling just to feed your people. Since the draw is all at the beginning of the game, risk management is not possible. While this amount of luck can be acceptable in a short game, I do not find it so in a long game.

Overly complex, with too many things going on and too many rule exceptions. Sometimes thematic, sometimes not. Changes too much for my taste by number of players. Too staged: these things happen in this era of the game. It would be an improvement to place the stage cards in the same places every game, the harvest happening when all stage cards have been placed--as is, one has something of a search for desired cards for large number of players. Too start-player dependent, ensuring rotation of start player or simultaneous action would have been better solutions.

In Puerto Rico, one builds, so even in last place, I feel like the least *successful* player. Agricola is about fighting the game and often destroying what you've built before (crops, herds), so even if I were to win, I think I'd feel like the least *failing* player.

I feel I have a handle on the game: and the handle should have been treated with disinfectant and antibiotics. Agricola has complexity, but not the elegance that great games have. To be sure, PR has its inelegant clunky parts, but at least one does not feel as if they are constantly fighting the game.

Plays around 1/2 hour per player, which is better than I expected.

Agricola used to be on my top 3 or so games of all time but it has fallen considerably.  While I still love this game with its animeeples, farm theme, and worker placement mechanics, I often dislike the length of this game, the setup time, and the amount of cards/options you need to pay attention to.  

In my opinion this game is on the verge between a mid-level game and an advanced heavy game and it puts it in an awkward place where I would rather play a heavier game with an amazing theme like Rebellion or a lighter game with a more neutral theme like Splendor.

Still despite the longer than expected length and heavier than expected options/choices, the game remains a very solid good game.  I would never say no to this game.

There is no disputing that many are left cold by Agricola’s obscure whimsical setting. Yawn, there are no explosions.  Yawn, no space-ninja-zombies.  There is no recapitulation of some grand(iose) colonial era.  Instead of summoning demons to do your bidding, you will summon carrots.  In Agricola, the goal is quite humbly to improve your lot.

And yet there are a million interesting decisions to be made in this context, what and when to plant, whether to breed or slaughter. There are seemingly endless paths to victory, but there is also a delicious tension in never knowing how deeply one should commit to any single path. The game forces you to strategize in layers of contingency. You will devise plan A, but be prepared to rally behind plan B (or C or D), and all the while work to shunt your fellow players away from their plans, denying them precious resources even as you work to collect your own.

Lastly, it is the sense of accomplishment at the end of a game, looking down at a physical model of your decisions, regardless of the final score, that makes 'Agricola' uniquely satisfying to me.

A wonderful optimization puzzle with just the right level of player interaction (indirect is my preference). The randomness of the cards force you to change your strategy with each game, making for high replayability. The only downside is the game can run long and can get AP-prone depending on the player (sometimes it's me!). But love it overall!

How can you say that #1 game on bgg is not a great game? It is a huge, solid game with a lot of replayability and even playable by novice players.
What makes the game great is also its biggest weakness, so many combination of cards makes it replayable forever, but also not so perfectly balanced. Anyway, a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding game.

Good game, but can be frustrating and actually feel like work. If someone else adds goods to the board every turn and takes care of sorting the cards for different number of players and basically does everything so I can just sit back and play, I would rate this 9. This game just isn't fun enough for me that all the work with the game pieces wouldn't bother me at all.

One of my all-time favorite games.

Have played only once so far, yet, to date. But much more to come for sure. Jumps right at the top of my list this one. 

Didn't get a clear picture of my abilities in this game playing a 4-way game with 2 newbies and two veterans. The mechanics, and especially the visual side are just amazing. (24 Aug 2008).

After 9 games (all family-games) I have gotten better picture of the game, and still like it a lot, but at this point I will drop the rating to 8. Maybe if I manage to get the cards in english, it will give more challenge again. (13 Feb 09)

Rating up to 9 after 4 games with Interactive deck. I really love the game again with the new elements (17 Nov 09)

Rating back to 8 now. 25 games played, and still fun. (06 Feb 11).

Not sure why the designer made a game that was so confined in play (too many things to do and not enough actions to do it) and then threw in random dealings of cards that can give a random boost to a player. That is begging for house rules where you get dealt 4 or 5 more cards and then discard.

Also, the family expansion not coming in for a while really bugs me along with the fact that there's one card that allows one person per turn until even later in the game when another card comes up just before the game ends. For the first card there's a mad dash for who can get to it first. How does that even make sense? How can only one family procreate in this town at a time? I much prefer something like Roads & Boats where anyone can increase their actions right from the start, they pick the best time for them and they can't be blocked by other players.

Enjoyed playing Agricola, but found the game to move a bit slow due to the multitude of options.

A decent game, but overrated.

Good: A euro with a strong theme! Equal amounts of maximising your own gain while minimising that of others. Lots of tension is brought about by having to feed your family. Really deep strategy and a ton of variety with the improvement/occupation cards.

Bad: The rulebook makes the game seem quite complex, when it is very simple in reality. It would be nice to have multiple avenues of victory instead of being harshly penalised for not having at least one of everything.

03 DEC 2010 - Inching it's way towards a 10 (9.5 right now).
------------------------------
I've gotten to play this game a few more times recently and really enjoying the depth and variability of this game....so many different strategies to take, so many things to try. Some games I have had cards I played all over the table (occupations, improvements, etc) and other times barely any. 

Bumping from 8.25 to 9.25 as I really want to play this more! Also, it helps a lot that 2-player games can be played in 1-1/2 hours if you don't let AP get in the way.
------------------------------
Played once with 4 players. Enjoyed it more than I expected to. I doubt I will be playing regularly, but will be willing to play once in a while. Love the choices and options. I stuck with one strategy  (baking) and eventually it paid off and allowed a few forays into other areas. I mis-understood one minor development and should (could) have played it much earlier. Also missed a couple of opportunities to inhibit others at the end and to develop faster. I may have won if I'd done a couple of small things differently...even with NEVER taking first player (except I got it first turn).

My missed opportunities makes me want to play it again to improve.

Theme is king in this well thought out game that meshes many mechanisms that I enjoy.  I find card drafting unnecessary because the players ability to manage his hand is far more important in determining their final score.  (The best player in our group wins every time even though he spends the whole game complaining about his allotment of cards.)

I love video games too, and had a similar feeling playing the addictive Harvest Moon series.

Reading that people do not like this game (I respect your opinion) and that Agricola's ratings will fall soon (I disagree) reminds me of forums where everyday someone declares that the Wii is a fad (it almost has 50% market share and continually outsells the other consoles by 2:1).

RATING: 8
If you're able to get things going relatively early, this game can be pretty enjoyable, but if you fail to get traction early on, it feels like you're constantly treading water and the game feels more like a chore.

The spatial element of the player boards is almost completely non-existent, so my board looks almost the same every single game.  It's annoying.

The interesting part of the game for me is trying to get a combo worked out with the cards you get at the start of the game, and trying to get that combo out on the table while still keeping your family fed.

Sold my first copy, but my gf wanted to get a copy so it's back in the collection.  Sadly, I think I dislike the 2p version more than 3-4p due to the scarcity of action spaces to get goods.

RATING: 7
This will appeal to the PR-euro crowd a lot. It itches nearly the same spot PR does, but with the huge number of cards, makes this game much more replayable. After playing a draft once, I'm positive that you need to play with a variant that allows you to discard and replace cards, or just draft cards - its just too easy to get screwed otherwise. Anyone that says a draft makes the game to long? You don't want to play with them anyway - THEY will make the game too long.

This isn't bad two players - other numbers make it too long and for that I'd much rather play Ora et Labora or Cavern than Agricola. I'd probably rank this higher as a concept, but as a ranking of desire to play, my rating is much lower.

This is one of those game that you are almost required to play a few times before it all starts to sink-in.  And one of the few games where I find myself thinking about afterwards ("should I have taken the wood offer, or extended my house").

It amazing how much the card expansions add to the re-playability to this game.  I own the Farmers of the Moor expansion, but have yet to play it, since I'm having so much fun with the base game, and finding the strengths of the cards from the E,I, and K decks.

This game is definitely deserving of it's lofty boardgame status.

Modern classic worker placement game by Uwe Rosenberg, great iPad version also; one of Ted's favorites and Shannon plays on iPad, but Lauren isn't as keen on grinding, subsistence-level difficulty/sameness of the early game.

Nicely integrated theme and mechanics to go with it. One thing I'm not so sure about is the card balance. If the other player has a good combo in his hand and you don't, is there really nothing you can do about it? I've seen this happen a couple of times and unless there's is (I don't know if there is) valid way to win without the cards, I see this as a serious problem. Over-hyped but still rather good.

Edit: 
This hasn't really gotten that much plays since. I doesn't draw me when I'm choosing what to play.

6/11/2013 Got the girlfriend and her daughter to play this one.  While her daughter used to refuse this game just as much as the girlfriend used to - I had to "collect" a debt from her daughter from a small bet from months ago.  In the end, the GF's Daughter ended up admitting to liking playing it and after we were done wanted to play again.  Not sure what to play and/or expect next...

5/12/2013 HUZZAH! Third times the charm. After two previous failed attempts using the family game rules and a few distractions, I got the girlfriend to play this one - FINALLY.  We skipped the family game and went straight to the real McCoy - granted we used the E deck. STILL, it's better than nothing. It took convincing from Lords of Waterdeep's gameplay as well as her love for the worker placement action of Alien Frontiers to finally give this one a final try.  She says it's ok - and at least it means it won't be banished and will go into the rotation.

7/9/2010I see and understand why this game is so popular.  There is much depth to the game.  Currently I do play it solo so it seems more like a puzzle than an actual game, however.

Hard to know what to say about this. I don't dislike this game, but I don't share the love for it that most people seem to have.

Edit: After a recent game of this, my first in some time, I enjoyed it a bit more than I remembered. Part of my dislike of it may have come down to the fact we overplayed it, and I got rather tired of it. I still find the game unnecessarily fiddly in places, and I think that the initial card deal can give players a rather unfair advantage. We're hoping to get around the latter problem by instigating some sort of card-drafting system in our next game, which should be interesting.

When I bought this game, it was the most complex board game I had ever played.  We've long since run out of score sheets, we played so much.  Looking back, though, the lack of interaction with other players, the long game times (including setup and cleanup), the tedium of re-stocking resources every turn, and the difficulty to teach to new players make me like this game less.  It's not a game I really seek to play anymore, and I would be hard pressed to give an expansion a try.

One of the clear hits of BGG.CON 2007, I was lucky to grab it for one play.  It was very impressive, but when you really dissect it, it's pretty much all stuff we've seen hundreds of times before.  Nothing truly new here at all, but still it was oddly compelling.  To me, it felt most like a light version of Roads & Boats (which still makes it a pretty heavy game).  We made a mistake in shuffling all of the occupation decks (and the minor improvement decks) together into one, and we were wondering why some of the cards seemed so much better than others, so we were glad to find out that if you played it correctly, it wouldn't have been as unbalanced as we thought it was.

Probably the best game out there.It has everything you dream of.So there is no need to stress the positive aspects once again.Let's go to the negative ones...
-You must have a company of 'hardcore' players.
-You must have plenty of time(we are supposed to play a bit carefully)
-It is not actually a game but a small essay.After a lesson of quantum physics in the university for example  you cannot play Agricola.
-All players must know the rules(or you need 45 minutes to fully explain the rules and some strategies concerning the cards)

Nice game actually my favorite but i play Agricola only in summer and big university breaks. 10/10 as a game 6/10 cause it is not actually a 'game'.

RATING: 8.5
A kind of combination of a game and play farm. I'd imagine it has lots of qualities that appeal to several types of players, so could work well as a family game too. The fact that it's very difficult to keep track of other player's success means it's sort of less competitive than normally - the scoring is more like a formality at the end of the game. Very nice.

The ultimate worker placement game, surprisingly accessible if you use the family game to introduce it. If you like very tense games with soft player interaction, this is for you, and the sheer amount of cards that go with it make it extremely replayable. Great components, too.

Perhaps THE grail game. Optimizing play given limited actions, every game is a puzzle waiting to be solved, with just enough conflict (how am i feeding everyone) thrown in.

RATING: 7
Pros: Nice bits.
Strong strategic play.
Good variability.
Fast and scales well.

Cons: Seems like work.
Newbies struggle against seasoned players.
Too much reading of cards.

Conclusion: I was lucky enough to have Steve Kearon (Steve K2) teach me Agricola.  While I still enjoy the game, I never have much desire to play it.  Maybe it is the long setup that it takes.  Or it could be that I always seem to play it poorly.  Whatever the case, I respect it as a good game and need to give it more chances.

Great game, great material, fantastic scaling.

Played a couple of games, and there are elements I like, but it's just not that deep a euro imo. I think the dealt profession cards are too varied, and if you don't get a couple of great ones, then you've got too hard a task if someone else is sitting on some doozies.

RATING: 10
Simply outstanding. The best game of 2007, hands-down. This game somehow creates and builds tension like few others, making the many decision points for players wonderfully angst-filled! I've played more than 100 games, with varying numbers of players, and each has its own unique character ... replayability for Agricola is phenomenal. Experience and skill tend to win out ... but not always, and I consider that uncertain element part of the charm. I do recommend drafting with the occupations and improvements to smooth out the luck. Simply deal 7 of each to all players, who select one of each and pass the rest to the left. Lather, rinse, repeat.

RATING: 7.5
A good solid game with lots of stuff to keep in mind.  First time I played I didn't really "get" the scoring and - not surprisingly - ended up in last place at the end.

After that I figured out that knowing the scoring rules makes it a lot easier to do better, and each time I've played I seem to "get" the whole game more than the last.

My son's reaction was that it was a bit tedious - which isn't completely inaccurate - but overall it's a good game even if there are one or two new players.  As long as everyone is willing to think; this is NOT a "beer and pretzles" game by any means.

RATING: 9.5
2 solitaire games so far. First - 28 pts, second, 54 pts. 
A great, great game with many agonizing decisions to take in the early stages. Remember to use the early stages to assure you have a proper food supply so you can concentrate on the real improvements later on!
Much more involving than Puerto Rico.
However, whereas after finishing PR I'd have another go, with Agricola I get the feeling of fullness after just one game. Hence the score.

Update: this game shines when played with 2-3 other people. Whereas solo play is all headology and predictive math, other players add a much needed element of chaos and interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays faster than I expected. Plays very nicely as 2p. Great game despite the ho-hum theme. It's funny to find myself saying "Woo Hoo, I got a plow!!"

Cons: Not the best "wife game" - causes annoyance at gaming partners when they take the resources you want. Game feels like it ends a little too soon. House improvement strategy isn't interesting to me. Not the most elegant design - feels like lots of elements conglomerated to make a game. Seems easy to run out of resource bits.

[Update] My rating drops from 8 to 7. After about 5 plays I got kinda bored with this game. Maybe it's largely the farming theme. The goals in the game aren't too motivating to me - I don't care if I get a stone house or more cows. I will probably pull it out again something soon and see if I like it better now that some time has passed.

RATING: 9.8
One play only, but this was the most balanced game that I have ever played. I love games with a random component that doesn't interfere with the strategy like the cards in this game. The cards can set your macro-strategy, but turn by turn there are plenty of strategic decisions to make.

Overall, an excellent game.

RATING: 6
Agricola starts with a crushing time constraint and never relents, for hours and hours.   All of the intricate scoring happens at the end of the game, so the competition is limited to snagging worker placement spots.  A wild variety of cards add fizz to the leaden economic engine, but they introduce too much luck for such a large investment of time.

After a few more plays I have decided that this is a fun solitaire game for me but loses its luster when playing with others due to the pace of play.  I appreciate it as a great game, I just don't have much fun playing it.  Traded away for the time being.

Few interaction and hard thinking, but I like it still. The harvests come ever so suddenly and the game is always one turn shorter than you thought.

One of the more influential games in recent years.  Although it didn't invent the worker placement mechanic, it certainly popularized it.  

Player interaction is a minor, almost non-existent element.  This would normally be a big turn-off, but building a well-balanced (and 3-D) farm with what scant resources are left available is challenging and engaging.

I appreciate how difficult it is to juggle short-term needs (food, resources) with long-term goals (expansion, diversification).  There's no narrative to the game, but the theme of having to scrape by to keep the family fed with a hopeful eye towards the future frames the mechanics well enough.

UPDATE: I'd like to get back into this game but, man, do I ever hate the rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful development game with sheer endless replayability, due to the constellation of minor purchases and apprenticeships. If there is a superlative to the term "tons of interesting options while only having limited actions", Agricola would surely deserve it. I doubt you will find that "one winning strategy". Even if you do, you will not be likely to repeat it, as you are dealt a different starting situation in each and every game, which'll force you to adapt to the new situation instead of always going to pull for the the same strategy over and over. It's hard to speak of great balancing after just one game, but finals scores were all within one point to the next player, with everyone coming from a different strategical approach. Great theme! You really feel like you are building up a farm in the late 17th century. The artwork was made with much love for the details. I don't want to rate it a 10 after one game, but I am sure this game will see more table time. And when it does, rating is likely to go up.  

Update: back down to an 8. I don't know why but I enjoy Le Havre more than this one.

RATING: 8
Extremely fun worker placement, with a surprisingly non-gamer friendly theme (farming). The game can be tense in the early rounds, but a properly expanded farm can carry its own weight. The occupation and improvement cards can be a strategic trap; don't try to play too many.

Significantly altered and improved by Farmers of the Moor expansion, which adds a variety of new options and strategies without altering the most significant parts.

RATING: 7.5
More information to follow, but after first play of the strict family game (no Minor Improvements or Occupation cards) I can safely say that I think this game will last.  The theme is rather harmless, but I do think the game will stand the test of time.

UPDATE:  Playing this (or any game) multiple times in a short time span can quickly lead to burn out.  While my opinion of the solidity of design remains unchanged, I just am not real interested in playing it over and over and over.  The cards are supposed to help replayability, and to give the game some depth, but the core system remains unchanged.  The game is very very good, I will just have to wait for a bit to play some more.

I love this tight farming game but it can be so frustrating. When you manage to pull a strategy off with your cards and actions working together it is very rewarding.

I like this best 2 player and find it goes too long with 5 players. Best played in a less serious and certainly non-tournament environment!

This is a tough one.

I actually quite like the game but I can't get anyone to play it with me - Whenever I suggest it, everyone pulls a face.

"It's like chartered accountancy in a pretty box" is one comment that has stuck in my mind. I have to admit it....even though I enjoy the game, it can be hard work on the old grey matter.

On that basis, I can only give it an average score. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Agricola deserves its spot up at the top.  Every play of it has been more thrilling than a game about medieval farming has any right to be.  I am 100 percent serious --  this is one of the most tense games I have ever played.  In each of my plays, I've generally been convinced by the second or third harvest that I'm completely doomed, and then by the end of the game it's all come together.  With so many strategies made possible by the hundreds of occupations and improvements, I can see this one getting lots and lots of table time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Still not sure what I think of this game. So far the general consensus is that there is too much to do cramed into far too few turns. I'd like to enjoy this more and be better at it, but I find it frustrating to play. Plan to try it again with the "Drafting Variant".

Worker placement game. Send your family members to work on the different action spaces to build a bigger & better farm and feed your family. You'll need to plow & harvest your fields, raise livestock, make babies and much more... A balanced farm will win the day. 2 decks of Occupation & Minor Improvement cards add variety.

I was expecting to be disappointed by this one with all of the hype.  But it was well worth it.  My wife and I LOVE it.  My only complaint is the long setup and takedown time.  Outstanding game.  I had ranked it a 9, but everytime I play it I like it more.
update - two years later it doesnt come out often because of the extreme setup/cleanup.  Can cause severe AP as well.

This is quite possibly my favorite game (certainly my favorite eurogame).

Having played again recently both with the cards and without, I do still enjoy the game after playing Caverna, but compared to the other worker placement games I own, this just lacks the interaction of others (Tzolkin, Caylus) and I would rather play either of those to this one. 

Caverna is a much more fun experience for me than Agricola. Agricola requires the cards to be an interesting and unique game to me and getting new players accustomed to the cards is just too challenging. Glad I traded it away. I would still play the game, but ownership was no longer required.

I really like this game. But for some reason, my family is very intimidated by it. So I don't get as many plays in as I'd like. I'll post more comments as my play count increases.

UPDATE, 3/29/12 - I've been getting this to the table more in the last year. My family is growing more fond of the challenge--especially my in-laws. In fact, my father-in-law got it for Christmas! So we'll be playing more of it in future visits I'm sure.

I'm ready to delve into the more advanced card decks to make it more interesting. I also own Farmers of the Moor, which I'm excited to crack as well. There is a lot of game with Agricola, and the expansion decks just seem to keep coming.

UPDATE: 12/3/2012 - After a few plays in the last week with my wife, Nora, and Aimee (and one game solo), I'm bumping it up to a 9 for its outstanding replayability and continuing depth. It keeps delivering. I have enjoyed exploring the Gamers' Deck (G Deck). I've found some very fun combos there.

I'm discovering more and more that I personally enjoy great combos in a game. This game has proven to be one of the best for that, making it one of my all-time favorites.

--

I bought the Spanish edition to practice my Spanish while I play! Should be good to use and play with other while I'm here in Guatemala too. I'll probably sell it or give it away before I leave. I think it would be good for Ash too, but she doesn't want anything to do with it since she doesn't want to have any part in being a [i]reason[/i] for buying a new game. I sincerely did buy it partly (probably mostly) for her and her Spanish. I thought she'd be happier about it. I was wrong. I guess I'll just practice my Spanish with it. There were several words I learned tonight in my first game with it. The cards are challenging because they use several new words, and they make me critically think in the language. I find it good practice.

2014-09. Agricola as a 2-player experience is starting to lose it's shine. The early game feels scripted with excessive competition over wood as you race once another to grow your family first. The experience starts to diverge at the mid-point, where only then can you start to make some strategic choices that can differ from game to game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial rating of 7 given after a single play of the family game. I expect this is unfair and the rating will rise with subsequent plays. However, I can't help thinking it is substantially inferior to Caylus as a worker placement game.

OK,OK - now that I've played it 4 more times using the occupation and minor improvement cards, I've seen the error of my ways and realise that this is a great game, even if a bit fiddly. Rating upgraded to 9.

10 plays: I've changed my rating back down again. It is a good game but two things, one major, one minor, count against it. Firstly, I find the game stressful to play. I'm racing against the clock (with other player's interfering) and there's just enough time to get everything done before the time runs out provided it all goes to plan. When the game ends, it's more a sense of relief than enjoyment. Secondly, the game is fiddly. It takes time to set up and tear down which, while not a showstopper, means it sometimes doesn't get to the table if I'm not in the right mood. Rating downgraded to 7.

I think I feel pretty comfortable calling this my favorite game, at this point. I really really love it.  I realize that's not an unpopular opinion (although some people are Agrico-haters, too, which I do not understand), but I think it's earned the following it has.  It has tons of interesting strategy options every game, and I love to make up stories about my family and my farm and my animals as the game progresses.  Caverna is probably the smoother play of the two, but my heart will never quite get over my little Medieval farm.

This is another game that newer games have killed for me. It's a smart, tense game...but it feels dated, and even when it first came out, I found the gameplay uncompelling. I especially don't like how unbalanced the cards are, though for tournament play I believe there are set cards, which sounds like a cool way to play.

I love the main worker placement gameplay of Agricola and trying to complete everything while other players mess up your plans.

The cards add a lot of replay-ability to the game but I really wish I could find a nicer variant on how to handle them. Picking the occupations and minor improvements takes too long and makes each turn fiddly to flip through them all and decide if I want to play one each turn.

I find it slightly more fun that Caverna.

RATING: 10
Do you love building a food engine?  Do you love farming?  Do you love starving because you're terrible at farming?  Regardless of your answers, you will love and hate Agricola as you struggle to build up and maintain a farm.  Truly an interesting and complicated game, but has a ridiculous amount of replay value with or without all the card expansions.  And the iOs version is a seamless transition!

My only complaint is aalllll those cards!

Stressful and unforgiving, but it feels so good to get an engine running. I'm not sure I love the random dealing of 7 occupations and minor improvements, but the 10-3 and drafting variants seem to remedy that pretty well.

RATING: 4
This game is frustrating and, to me, feels like work. Basically, every time I play, I feel like I'm supposed to have a lot of options and the game is supposed to be wide open. I don't and it's not. It's very constrained. I want to have fun and, for brief moments, I might, but mostly I just feel like I'm trying not to starve (which is realistic and thematic, weeee!).

RATING: 9.75
Absolutely fantastic gaming system.  Plays well with 2-5 players, and is a tense and tight game even without the cards.  The board cards alone add flexibility in the game play so that every game feels unique, but the minor improvement and occupation cards are what really make the game shine.  New synergies emerge every time the game is played, whether we use a card draft or just deal them straight out.  The cards allow for myriad tweaks of the game, making me feel that I will never tire of playing Agricola.

UPDATE: 3 years on and 200 face to face plays later and Agricola is still going strong.  The new decks add some spice, but I still enjoy the base game.  I'm always happy to play.  I've only played a handful with 5 players or with Farmers of the Moor, so there's still a vast amount of play left in this.

Agricola is a great worker placement, farm building, family feeding, surprise ending, last minute scoring, card driven.... well it's just fun to build a farm.

Too fun and Agricola can be long with a large group. However, in my opinion this can be one of the most rewarding two player experiences you can get. Maybe my 3rd favorite 2 player game of all time.

RATING: 10
The One Above All :the forefather of worker placementt, but also the best drafter.

Just The Deepest, Most balanced, Most Rewarding, Most humbling... I Could go on.

2nd edition took to long to come along.  if you're playing 1st edition ban top 7 to 9 OP cards and bottom 7 to 9 UP cards before drafting, you'll still have plenty of amazing cards to play.

RATING: 6.4
I finally got to play this and I did enjoy it.  I was honestly VERY overwhelmed by the number of choices available in this game.  I never quite figured out a good strategy nor do I feel like I ever fully understood the interaction between many of the roles/resources/etc.

Still, it's a fun game with a lot of great depth.  It's a bit complex for my average gaming group.

It also gives me the same sort of angst that Puerto Rico and other games of this style give me...that just as I feel like I'm finally getting into the grove, the game ends.  It feels like the game is all build up, without significant time to enjoy the efforts made.

Farmtastic fantasy, Oo-Aree... Another one of those dubious genre games that turned out to be a splendid romp.

My first game of Agricola I was horribly defeated.  I thought about it for a bit afterwards, and tried to figure out how to generate a food engine of some sort.  Finally I got online and played the solitaire version, playing just the first harvest about 6-7 times.

Now that I understand the game, I find the card-play and interplay among the players to be very interesting, and always look forward to playing the game.

I think it's an excellently-designed game, but I'm really bad at it and that keeps me from enjoying it as much as I should.

RATING: 9
Great with excellent balance. Do need to do a draft of some sort with occupation/minor improvements cards to maintain balance. Requirement to get food is very strict which restricts creativity and can make games feel very similar.

N.B I do rate this higher than Caverna, though I think Caverna can be more fun but Agricola is definitely the better game!

1-5 players.

Build up a farm and hope to god your family doesn't starve to death. Much more intense than it sounds as you have to dabble in all elements of farmwork to avoid losing points, but stretch to wide and your points will be minimal! Balance Sheep, Pigs, Cattle, growing your family, expanding and renovating the house, and growing vegetables and grains. Serious brain burner but one of the best games ever.

When I started exploring Uwe Rosenberg's designs I started with Le Havre and I was not too taken by the theme, but thought the game play was very strong. I just recently tried Agricola and I loved it! The theme was spot on instead of "tacked-on" as Le Havre felt. All the spots on the board had a definite purpose. And I love the fact that you had to find a way to feed your people during each harvest phase giving it a puzzle-like feel. Definitely my favorite game at this moment!    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably the best pure worker placement game I've played.  My favorite part of the game is getting my hand of cards and crafting some grand plan that is almost certain to fail.  The rules aren't difficult to teach but the game is very unforgiving on new players, you will probably do terrible your first few games.  But it is a very good, very well done game.

I have played and enjoyed the solo game as well as all types of multiplayer games. As with most games the more serious gamers you have the more fun it is to play.

I don't care for all the decks, the imbalances in the decks, and the lack of clarity of many of the cards. Had it been released as just the "Family Game" it might have actually rated higher for me. With so many parts and pieces, it's hard to get to the table and my family doesn't enjoy it that much anymore. At least thematically, it works better than Le Havre.

A near perfect game.  While the rules were a bit hard to get right the first couple plays, i'm now loving this game.  It's tons of fun building your farm up from nothing, and there's just endless strategy.  My only complaint is the point system is setup in a way where the goal will usually be similar for most players.   Either way, this is my highest ranked game, and will probably be the default boardgame for a while.

It's ok. It's frustrating that I see the potential there, and I really like some aspects of the game. It may end up being one of those that I don't like as much as the rest of the crowd, which is cool. Some quotes from the forums that sum it up for me:

"Agricola strikes me as a game built of agonizing choices, rather than a game containing agonizing choices." 

"The whole darned game seemed like an endless exercise in 'just barely making it."

An excellent worker placement. In classic Euro style, this is not an aggressive game so it suits players who don't like 'hostility' in games. Nice relaxing theme, with decent replayability due to the shear number of included cards.

That said, it isn't actually one that everyone likes as it can get a little 'mathy' if people stress too much about score optimization towards end game.

RATING: 6
I think the ratio of "amount of time owned versus number of times played" is worse for this game than nearly any other game in my collection.  For what it is, the game just feels 'clunky' - too much moving cards and wooden cubes in between turns, let alone on them.  Add to that the "first turn analysis dump" of having a huge hand of cards dealt out on turn 1 to define your strategy and I just haven't felt much impetus to get this to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Mechanics wise, this is a diamond game because it has:
- Tough choices 
- Multiple rewarding mini-goals
- A plethora of available strategies
- High Replayability both due to different start-up (cards)and player interaction
- An accurate and fair victory point system.

But the magic in this euro game is that despite it's great design, it's also thematic. You actually feel like a struggling farmer trying to improve your welfare. You constantly try to balance your needs with improving your prosperity and you are rewarded for your efforts accordingly. 

Although the theme integration is high, the theme is a bit uninspiring, although I admit that the experience is still better than games with a more "catchy" theme disconnected from the mechanics. Another minor flow, the game is prone to analysis paralysis, and therefore it's usually rather long to finish with 4-5 players.


If you ever wanted to be a farmer struggling to make a living this is your boardgame-dream come true. Otherwise, this is the game that will make you want to be one!

I love this game!  It was well worth the price tag.  We have played this game probably a dozen times now, and it hasn't gotten old.  The shear number of cards that come with the game makes sure that you are almost continually seeing cards you never saw before.

I was concerned that this game was going to be hyped when i first picked it up. I wasn't playing alot of board games beyond your classics and this was one of the first "euro" games for me to pick up. Each time i play it i enjoy it a little more and the change of strategy each time makes the replayability perfect. I also feel as if the time frame for this game is perfect and the components are amazing! For the price i have a feeling that this game is going to pay for itself when i rack up 100+ plays.

RATING: 9
Worker placement, building an economic engine, cards that let give you all kinds of special powers to break rules.  None of these mechanisms is unique, but here they are well implemented, fit together nicely, and work very well with the unique (although not that exciting) theme.  The multitude of cards keeps the game fresh to an extent, but I still have a few concerns.  Chief among them is the big differences in the power of cards, both alone and as part of combinations.  This is solvable by drafting, but at the price of increased play time.  I find that Agricola is interesting in a puzzle-solving kind of way, and I want to play it more, but it ultimately falls just short of being one of a 10 for me.

Rating by number of players:
1-player: 6 (interesting, but without staying power)
2-player: 7 (OK, but too little competition)
3-player: 9
4-player: 9
5-player: 8 (gets a bit long with this many)

Damn this game for being as good and addicting as it is. Something in me wanted to rebel against the hype and #1 ranking, but it is a perfect game for an evening with me and the wife. It has dropped a little bit in my rankings because it does not get grabbed often enough. I think that it is a little too heavy for its own good. It's still a good strong game, but it can be exhausting to play often.

RATING: 10
What I like:

-So many interesting choices and different strategies every single round! The replay value is huge with all these choice and different cards.
-Very thematic! The mechanics and the look of the game really support the feel of trying to run a succesful farm back in the day.
-Well made components - The animals are so cute and it really helps these are included with the game nowadays.
-A great brain teaser
 

What I do not like: 
(Actually this time it's more what others might dislike) 

-Well, mostly that the harshness is not for everyone but it personally doesn't borther me.
-A bit long and some of the rules are not intuitive to teach.
-Some people say you don't get to specialise but I personally would disagree with that. Yeah, you gotta get different things at the very end to get the points, but until the very very end you've had your very Unique strategy helping you get there and provide for your family. 

All in all my personal favorite classic eurogame

I like it, but I don't love it.  Everyone else is in love with it, so I'm more than willing to play and I am constantly hammering away at the system.  A cool worker placement game.  Actually, my comment is worthless as you can find people gushing about this title and slamming it.  Better than most, but not as good as some.  

3 plays in and I probably would have dismissed this already, but its really well perceived by this site and my geekbuddies, and the people I play against.  So, this will get more play for sure.

RATING: 10
OK I broke my Agricola cherry last night and it is a great game. Does it deserve to be a 10? I'm not sure, it took Puerto Rico a long time to get there and I never award a 10 right away and certainly not after 1 game so we'll see where this one goes. Tough, very tough decisions to be made in this game from start to finish.

One thing I will strongly say about this game is that they did something very different than a lot of other games. Most games would come out and shortly thereafter release expansions fairly quickly. I feel like the various decks ARE the expansions and it's nice to have bought a game and feel like I've already been given the expansions and can look forward to many many months of game play. 

UPDATE:
After 36 plays in a relatively short amount of time I find myself wanting to play Agricola more and more. This game kicks ass all over the place. Hype is one thing but this game lives up to it.

UPDATE:
I play this game all the time and well didn't even  start recording plays until about 40 had gone by...still not getting old. This is certainly a sign that this is a truly GREAT game.  

UPDATE:
Well over 100 plays now and I still love this game. That's the mark of a truly great game if you ask me. I teach this game to new players using standard (non-family) rules and using all 4 decks...yes even Z. New players get the full load when I teach and as a result I can count 2 who have literally purchased the game the day after I taught it. (Certainly more bought it after learning but those took longer than 1 day!)

This game's ability to scale with number of players means it's great at any number. People will have their favorite sweet spots but the board and cards both scale so well it shines no matter what and always feels like you are playing Agricola not matter what.

Found it to be frustrating at first, so many option and so little time.  We had kind of shelved it as a game that we just didn't enjoy much, then a friend mentioned that he and his wife really enjoyed the family version of the game.  We found that it was much more enjoyable for a laid back game with friends.  Still rather stressful, but now you felt like you could get somewhere.  Maybe it's time to pull out the Occupations and Minor Improvements again.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Raised my rating from a 7 to an 8 after my seventh play.  I've tried it now with one-player, two-players, three-players, and four-players.  It scales very well (in the league with Goa and Tigris in terms of scaling) and very few games scale to accommodate a variety of player counts.  I have also tried the I and K deck now, and the sheer plethora and diversity of cards is indeed impressive.  However, while my rating has risen steadily with more plays, I don't expect the rating to go above an 8.  It's a very good game, but I can easily think of 20 games I'd rather play, so while it's very good, it's not quite great in my mind ---- UPDATE: Raised my rating from 6 to 7 after my fourth play and the first time using the drafting variant, which is a variant that I don't anticipate ever playing without in the future, may go to an 8 with further plays of the I and K decks ----- ORIGINAL COMMENT: I'm very perplexed by the people who call this "multi-player solitaire."  This game is extremely interactive, such that when we played back-to-back, I think changing the seating order definitely affected the game.  Players are choosing actions just like in Caylus, so each action can only be taken once, which clearly forces you to think about what your opponents are doing so you can plan and prioritize accordingly.  Anyway, I just had to get that out of the way first.  On to explaining my rating.  I really wanted to like this game.  Everything I had read going in sounded so good, but after three plays I think a 6 is about right unfortunately.  I'm still willing to play a few more times with someone else's copy if the opportunity arises, but don't feel the need to.  The game itself was all well and good, but the initial deal of the cards is what bothered me the most.  The cards and card combinations are clearly not balanced, which is fine (and I love Twilight Struggle despite the cards obviously being unbalanced), but unlike Twilight Struggle where you are dealt many different hands of cards, you are stuck with your one hand of cards for the entire game of Agricola, essentially sealing your fate for the next 2 hours in the first 2 minutes of playing.  That's an overstatement since a bad player can of course screw up a great hand and a good player can do something with poor cards, but among players of approximate equal skill and with the rules as written, it seems silly to play for 2 hours when some players have great cards and card combinations, and others do not.  I should note that I'm not bothered by this because I did especially poorly or especially great, but rather because I did both.  In my two games, I scored something like 19 and 49, due primarily to the cards I was dealt, and I saw my opponents' scores vary wildly depending on their hand of cards.  That being said, I love the angst in this game of wanting to do 5 actions and having to pick just 1, and I do like the integration of theme with the mechanics, as well as the likely high degree of replayability due to the vast number of cards.  So the only thing I can think to try the next time I play is to do a draft where each player is dealt 7 occupation and 7 minor improvement cards, keeps 1 of each, and passes the remaining 12 clockwise, and so on.  The problem is that this will likely add at least 20 minutes to the game, which may make it not worth it.  I don't think I really like the game with the rules as written, and I'm not sure this variant will be worth the increased game length, which leaves me uncertain as to whether this merits many more plays.  Lastly, regardless of  interest in this game, I highly recommend checking out this GeekList - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/27177 - because it provides some great insights into the mind of a game designer.

RATING: 9.5
Easily my favorite game.  

Great engine building, lots of strategy, and plenty of opportunities to disrupt other players.  There's a massive diversity of strategies that a player can employ, and replay-ability is great thanks to 14 cards (Professions, minor improvements) that are different each game.  While some strategies work well regardless of your cards, players are forced to adapt to find an ideal strategy working with the cards they've been dealt.

The game requires a lot of forethought - Sometimes a card in your hand will be great halfway through the game, but in order to utilize it properly you'll need to start planning on it from the first turn.  This is great for players who love planning ahead, but can be a serious struggle for players who are newer to tabletop strategy games.

While I love the game, it is not without flaws.  The random professions and improvement cards add an aspect of luck, which in some cases can provide a major unfair advantage to some players.  The large number of components, resources, and rules can also feel a bit overwhelming for new players.  

Overall still one of my favorite games, after many, many plays.  Definitely worth a try if you're into deep strategy, engine building and planning games.

(2 plays, 1 family and 1 full) It was good fun, in the brainburning optimization way that good games have for me. It has a lot of skill to it. I'll certainly play it many times. I don't think I'm likely to join the 10-raters on this one, though; I'm not sure exactly what it was lacking (I'll be sure to comment if I figure it out) but I prefer Caylus, Brass, and Imperial right now.

Love this game, especially that it came with so many variants.  It's also pretty easy to teach if you tell your players to not worry about winning their first game.  Just get the mechanics down through play, and at the end of the game, when scoring is done, it will all come together, and the second game will be much easier to understand.

This game was an easy hit with my game group. The theme is relatable and the game itself is easy to understand but difficult to master.

The myriad of options available - especially with the minor improvements and occupations that are dealt out at the start of the game - means that no two games of Agricola will ever be exactly the same. The improvements and occupations add a very tactical decision to the game.

This game is always frustrating for me. I hate that I can never really tell who is winning, and that passive-aggressiveness is really the only way to influence other players. The theme is a bit dull too. It's one of the only games where I have won, but felt disappointed when I did. I'll be happy to never play it again.

(Just recently purchased)

As of right now, April 3rd 2014, It's not my favorite game to play for strategy. It has a great mechanic and the components are great. I need to play more to determine my final score of this game.

The only gripe I have about it right now after the 1st couple plays is that it is pretty linear for scoring and no way to specialize in one area.

Did I mention I'm a Uwe Rosenberg fan? I love the complex nature of this game, microturns and all. The hard choices and indirect resource stealing competition make this game tricky. One of the best integrated themes out there. The different player setups result in radically different games depending on number of players. The multitude of cards keep the game fresh and give it variety.

RATING: 6.5
Bleah what do I think about this. I see it has two unpleasant aspects that no doubt are what make it rank very highly on BGG: Tons of special cards to study (even a few, if you play the family version) and tons of things that affect your score. So you can really develop expertise with this game, but on one's first play you probably don't know what you should be doing.

I only played the family game (and probably only will play that). I like worker placement and I like the threat of losing points if you can't feed your people. (I finally tried Agricola thinking it might be similar to In the Year of the Dragon.) The point salad feel combined with a seemingly large number of placement options (and thus less feeling of blocking others) made my first game less tense than I expected.

But for various reasons, final scores were not close. That suggests to me that learning some basic strategy would increase competition for specific actions and improvements.

The game doesn't take very long to play, which I appreciated.

I played "All Creatures Big and Small" before this, and my respect for that effort increases. It is much less of a point salad game and doesn't have the inelegance of using cards as additional places to put workers. (Unfortunately perhaps, I don't find it strictly better, as it only plays two, has no variability, and nothing corresponding to needing to feed workers.)

And I will say it is as good as advertised.  The only reason it is not a 10, is I think the packaging in the box is not great, and there is not enought wood, clay, etc.  Okay okay I know I have a zillion alternate items that can be used, but it would be nice to have more included.  But with that said, this game has endless possibilities, and I have already purchased all the expansions! Don't be afraid if you are someone who doesn't like long games, this one is worth it.

About 15 games in Boiteajeux. I find growing fast too important whatever strategy you take. Family game is ellegant and useful to learn basics. Advanced game with occupation/minors cards adds a lot of replayability, but not sure if more strategy paths. Strategy paths are based on the feeding mechanich you choose, mainly baking bread or slaughtering animals. It plays good with 2P but really shines with 3-4 players. Downs: it is a very expensive game, maybe it isn´t worthy if you play only 2P because lots of cards are out of play, and it demands a huge table to play. My rating at the moment is 8.

7.01.13 UPDATED: Bought and played 10 games in 3 weeks with my partner! and 10 more in Boiteajeaux (2,3 and 4er). Well, I was wrong, this game is amazing even with just 2 players. 2 player is a very cutthroat game, where blocking your opponent is the way to take. Cooking animals is a dominant strategy and baking is pretty harder/risky but still interesting to support animals in some games. With 4 players the game is more open, and feeding systems feels more balanced. It's a lot less about blocking and more about 'take your way' game. 4er the deserves more variety and more strategies for the players. 3 player feels in the midlle ground between 2 and 4, but seems that third player in the turn order feels too weak. I think the game is best with 4, next with 2, and then 3 (Not played with 1 or 5). Replayability feels outstanding (even with just 2 player cards). Down side is the huge amount of bits, cards, pieces...You need a big table to play this and setup&cleaning time is not less than 20 min.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic for a reason. It's remarkably thematic for a modern euro and with its millions of card expansions the variability of setup is incredible. I do not enjoy playing it as much as I perhaps should. I'm not a fan of how players often are forced to focus on a bit of everything and it's perhaps a bit too tight. That said, I still like the game quite a bit but it is not very elegant. The cards still make it better than Caverna.

RATING: 8.3
A great exercise in planning and prioritising that is very hard to crack and still challenges experinenced players in a way that many lighter games can not. Unfortunately there are problems with the base game that prevent it from living up to its potential. Many of these are corrected by the 'Farmers of the Moor' expansion (the combo gets a 9).

The main issue is just that there are too few paths to victory. Some elements of the game are underused, like renovation and the improvements. It's not worth having too many of any type of animal, so, ideally, you would end up with the same farm every time. Also, some elements of the game are too crude, like the cards can be too decisive or access to spaces can be too cutthroat. As I said, the expansion irons out many of these issues.

Some people complain that it has too much complexity, but since the gameplay is so tricky, the game will appeal to heavy gamers who will also appreciate its complexity and the number of modifying cards (to add replay value).

I like the depth and unobvious value of actions. It's a lot of fun for me - I think over games from days ago knowing what I could've done better. There's enough variety, thanks to the random order of round cards and the Cards That Do Stuff (occupations and minor improvements) that it can keep me coming back. I've done a few solo plays, and they're alright, but they take away the best part of the game - the competition and uncertainty of getting the actions you want. This game encapsulates the inability to do everything you want as well as getting your plans ruined and needing to resort to a backup.

The game is long, though, usually up to 3 hours.

I'm actually surprised that I like this game as much as I do.  Perhaps it is because of the strong theme, perhaps it is because the worker placement mechanics work very well, or perhaps it's because of the sheer enormity of the game.  If you're looking for a game that truly makes you feel like a struggling farmer, this game is about as close as you could possibly get.  It's got that worker placement tension that creates agonizing decisions every turn, and the variety that comes from the occupation and minor improvement decks is truly impressive.  The cards add a lot of depth and variety, but they do bog the game down because there is a lot to read and comprehend.  However, the family version doesn't use the decks at all, it is a great way to introduce non-gamers to the game, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well the game works under those circumstances.  Overall, it's a long and harsh battle for victory points at heart, with a solid and unique theme backing it up. I didn't think a game about farming could be that fun, but apparently I was wrong.

It’s a great game with high replayability due to the hundreds of cards (occupation and minor improvements).

This is any strategy lover's dream. I avoided it like the plague when my husband bought it, having nightmares about anything even tangentially related to farming after Farmville ruined the universe. What a pity. 

This game takes a while to learn, but your patience will be rewarded greatly. We prefer not to complicate it with the largely fussy and unnecessary 'minor improvements' card deck and keep things simple. Game play is fast, and involves choices to be made at every turn, which soon snowball into your success/failure as a farmer. Agriculture at its most frustrating & exhilarating! Play with a competitive group to really put you in agony ;)

Not a #1 game, but i enjoy it.  I think what keeps it down for me is that, while i like to build engines, what i most like is seeing those engines profit me.  In this game, there is always a feeling of being behind - you never get to coast on your wonderful farm.  Another harvest is always around the corner.

Tons of replayability with the cards.

like others i have a small issue with the scoring forcing you into a generalist strategy.
---------------
June 2012 update - demoted from 7 to 6.  Agricola is nice, but feels like work.  My tastes seem to be moving towards "fun" in games.  Agricola is not fun, really.  Its interesting, i guess.  If i have a hankering for a complex, engine-building game that frightens newbies, i will go to Puerto Rico.  New players are always keen on the complexity of PR - with Agricola, they are overwhelmed by the options and the race for food.  It can be a brutal, unfun game at times.

Agricola is a classic Worker Placement game. The game is simple, but you have so many options to score that you need to be careful all the time. The game is a battle for resources such as food. I played Agricola only in family mode and I can say even in a lighter mode, is the best pure worker placement game I've ever played.

Ein absoluter Strategieüberhammer. Position 1 in der BGG halte ich für überbewertet. Aber es ist auf jeden Fall ein klarer Top 10 Kanditat. Im Prinzip ist das Spiel auch sehr simpel und schnell erklärt: Es gibt zahlreiche Aktionsfelder (Holz nehmen, Äcker pflügen, Ställe bauen, Schweine züchten) und man hat pro Familienmitglied eine Aktion also am Anfang zwei pro Runde, bis man die Familie erweitert. So besteht eine Runde im Prinzip lediglich daraus, seine zwei Familiensteine auf Aktionsfelder zu setzen und dann die Aktion auszuführen. Sehr, sehr simpel. Allerdings gibt es halt sehr viele Aktionsfelder und sobald eines von einem Familiemitglied eines Spielers besetzt ist, kann kein anderer Spieler mehr diese Aktion machen. So gibt es immer viel zu tun, auf einem Bauernhof fällt schließlich jede Menge Arbeit an, bevor die Ernte ansteht, und viel zu wenige Aktionen. Ein typisches Mangel-Optimierungsspiel. 
Für mich persönlich ist es nicht so der Überhit, mich nervt einfach der Zwang die Familie versorgen zu müssen, und auch die Tatsache dass Aktionen weg sind, wenn jemand sie benutzt hat. Wieso kann mein Bauer nicht mehr fischen gehen, wenn Bauer Robert schon fischen war. 
Das Aufbauen ist ebenfalls eine Qual, die man allerdings gerne in Kauf nimmt, die zahlreichen Tüten sind echt mehr als hilfreich. Die Spieldauer ist ein weiteres großes Manko, pro Spieler ca. 30 - 45 Minuten, gerade gegen Ende dauern die Überlegungen deutlich länger.
Aber alles in allem ein sehr schönes Spiel, dass es auf jeden Fall wert ist gespielt zu werden.

Such a fantastic game.  It's really hard to get new people to play it because it's very challenging.  It's relatively easy to learn as far as the worker placement goes, but the order of operations is tricky.  The steps necessary to go from planting a field to baking bread for example are pretty involved.  So I don't get to play it very much but when I do I always enjoy it quite a bit.

En favorit även om folk inte så ofta gillar att köra med minor improvements och occupation korten. Jag föredrar att köra Card-Drafting med 10 kort där man i slutet väljer ett kort av 4. Men få som jag kör med har sådan koll på korten så det blir aldrig av. Funderat på at skaffa Family Edition för alla mina syskon vägrar spela detta nu.

Not my favorite Rosenberg but a wonderful thematic game.  I like hard games.  The puzzle of drafting the best cards and figuring out how to utilize them is challening and rewarding.

Doing one thing per turn should be dull but it's precisely the point of the game and captures the theme of "labor is difficult you had better be smart".  It makes every choice agonizing.

Survived my "euro cleansing".

An almost endless selection of decisions.  A descendant of Goa and Puerto Rico, but with much more variety: because the players hold their own cards to use (or not), the communal board actually looks different to each of them, as it has to be weighed against their hands.  Still, more fiddly than the gaming payoff is worth.

Not sure I'd want to play it very often.

Ok... read to the end!

So frustrating.  the only player interaction is watching the person before you take the action spot you wanted.

It's like a sailing race with no wind - too much effort to go nowhere.

Definitely a sound game, but feels too long, too much like hard work and not one to make me come back often.  Annoyingly, I will want to come back to it.

My "6" is harsh and just post-game, but right now I'd sooner beat myself over the back with a knotted rope whilst having my nipples wired to the mains.  

Very overrated with all the hype... solid game, but no better than the others in the top 10 list.

And it's not as nice as Puerto Rico or Settlers.  So there!


After 5 plays... yes, I'm learning to love it, so score adjjusted accordingly.  It's still a big learning curve, and a lot does seem to depend on the hand of cards you're dealt, but the variety is great and it is a very clever game!

Ok, I kept coming back (which says something about the game) and after several games, yes, its lovely.  So good i bought the expansion, which is nearly as lovely.  A cracking game, but a shame it's so hard to get into at the beginning of playing it...

Not too keen at the start.. I misunderstood the rules, there as no example of play... lots of cards...family (ie simple) and advance (normal game) but as we played it got better. Playing with more people helped too.

Now... well it seems pretty good and we always seem to run out of time.. a funny game that seems to not be complete? 

Whoever wins seems to be the person who lost by the least?

Long term we'll see....

Another 6 months later. Two of my friends who play have bought their own sets to play as well. Now include all the cards and complex cards. The cards can make things quite random and unfair if not handled properly. The 10 and keep 7 rule works pretty well.

Six months later... Great game! Good complexity, lots of variety, reasonably quick play, all good!

My rating is for 2 players, specifically.  I believe having 3 or 4 players, and using all occupations, would make this game a 10.

Pros:
+Deep strategy game
+Enjoy seeing farm get built
+Enjoy art style
+Good variety of occupations/minor improvements

Cons:
-No box insert
-Takes a few places before you realize the amount of potential approaches to victory.  At first, it may seem like it's scripted -- after many more plays I now believe it's just a matter of better learning the cards.

Other things to consider:
:Very cutthroat; many opportunities to block and hurt someone, badly
:Very minimal luck component
:Epitome of "not enough time to do everything you want to do"

The cards make, and break this game.  They are what makes this a different game every time.  They also make it possible for someone to basically win the game before it starts.  I would think that would be extremely rare, but possible that someone gets a great set of cards that all feed off each other and everyone else will be playing for second.  That's a tough pill to swallow for such a long game, but it is still fun to play and if you can deal with that one flaw it is an excellent game.

RATING: 10
I wasn't sure I would like Agricola, given the seemingly mundane theme (I mean, farming in the Middle Ages?). Also, it seemed rather bizarre to only allow one action to be used at a time, so only one person could build a minor improvement or collect wood (why would I not be allowed to do what my neighbor farmer is doing?). But for some reason, and obviously I am not alone in this, given the ranking of this game, it works. The first time I played I was immersed in my little medieval world (it didn't hurt that we have the custom animeeples for this game), building up my little farm and growing my family. It sometimes felt like all I was doing was worrying about feeding my family, but that'll probably go away with more plays. It's a game that I wan o play more often, and hopefully I'll get to soon.

Played with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players and absolutely love this game. Maybe a bit more with 2 or 3 players. I can imagine that de order of seating or the hand of cards you are dealt can play a role in determining your chance to win, but so far this has not bothered me.
For now, I feel that Agricola plays like "Pillars Of The Earth" advanced. POTE is definitely more suitable for casual gamers, while Agricola might be more interesting for the more dedicated crowd. It also reminds me of Caylus, but I like it a lot better as it has more variety and is easier to explain.
I did not have high expectations for this game (it looked a little boring at Essen, which may be due to the unoriginal components), but it turned out to be a real surprise. There are just so many ways to win! Next time, I will try a different strategy.
UPDATE: I know more and more people who really don't like this game (too involved, too long, too much like work), and who prefer more accessible games like Stone Age. So it's hard to bring it to the table nowadays. Lowered rating to 8.

Having just played once with 5-players as a newbie, these are my initial thoughts. I enjoyed the game but not starry-eyed. I understand the hype and all but this game, at first glance, is fiddly. I think this has to do with the huge amount of card text and the sheer number of pieces in the game. The game is well-designed but I feel it is out of reach for casual gamers. I have not yet tried the family version, perhaps it is more approachable. While I do like this game, it really does not feel original. Most of the mechanics were borrowed from other games. While is not possible to expect something fresh each time, I just didn't feel as amazed by the game. However, the theme is incredible. This game's theme is very very well integrated and very engaging. When all is said and done, I will still end up owning this game.

edit: Having played this game a couple more times, each time with a 5, 2 and solo player settings, I think this game is a very well-designed game. It also scales pretty well, including, surprisingly, the solo game. While the decisions are numerous, I feel like there is a distinct path to optimization. I must admit that without the cards in the family game, the game will get stale rather quickly. With the cards, the dynamics of the game changes quite bit. Thumbs up. The game is good, but falls short of the hype that it has received thus far. Pimping the game really does make the game play a little more aesthetically pleasing. 

7/11: Really did not like 5-player game at all. I think card draw is unbalanced. I actually enjoyed the family version much more right now. 
090211: Another 5 player game. This time, three players were tied! Without a tie breaker, it was rather frustrating.

I gave Agricola a 10, because I'll always be willing to play it (played it more than a 100 times) but not because it's the perfect game. A lot of the issues have been fixed in v2.0 though. It it's not so unforgiving as e.g. Terra Mystica (although sometimes it is) but its simply a though game and to win you really have to be able to anticipate the moves of your compatitors and be quick to change course if necessary. And you should not have issue's with choosing, Plan ahead, think ahead, have backup plans! Nothing better than if you've catched on with the flow!

I played the family version of this game 7 times before I moved onto Farmers of the Moor. I still haven't touched the occupations yet! 

This game is fantastic! It is definitely punishing when you first start playing. Once you're familiar with the tempo of the game, it has a wonderful puzzle like feature in trying to squeeze the most out of your limited actions.

I don't mind at all that the game seems to end just as you get your engine started, it just spurs me on to complete my engine before the final round!

My only regret with regards to this game is that I wish I didn't wait so long to try this game out. I didn't believe the hype, but boy oh boy, was I wrong. 

I don't think I could play another family game with just the base game. It's still Agricola but far and away a shadow of the great game it is.

Update: I've been wondering if without the expansion, this game isn't very good. The constant rush for wood and family growth are issues, and the fact that more workers equal more actions and even more points compounds the snowball effect. Without expansions, 3 player is a lot better than 4 player, though less tight. With 4, initial starting position is huge and the food difference is too small to mitigate.

I always play with the variant where the player who is coming second in turn order isn't allowed to take starting player. This variant removes the bickering over turn order between two players and prevents the person who had previously claimed first player to then suddenly find themselves in last position. Admittedly this is an issue in the 4+ player game but I've kept it when playing 3 player as well.

Tendo jogado apenas uma partida, ainda não me encantou. Achei com opções demais e pouco tempo. Talvez começar com 3 workers ao invés de 2, ou tendo umas 8 rodadas a mais ajudasse. Também joguei a versão sem cartas de ocupação, o que diminui bem as variações. Inegável que a mecânica é boa e tem muita estratégia escondida alí, mas ainda preciso dar mais algumas chances.

RATING: 8
This really is an excellent game, for a lot of reasons. It scales from 1 to 5. It's got different potential complexity levels depending on whether or not you use the cards and which ones you use. It's got a good mix of long-term strategy (choosing occupations, planting fields early, picking complementary improvements) and tactical thinking (grabbing a fat resource pile, trying to figure out what your opponents' next actions are). It has enormous replay value with all the cards included. It has a reasonable playing time. It has cuddly animeeples.

But I think the biggest reason Agricola makes such a good impression on me is the relevance of the theme. I'm no farming enthusiast or anything, but I do find games a lot more fun when I can imagine a narrative going along with them, and Agricola is good for that. It also helps a lot with teaching the game and bringing in casual/non-gamers. Most of the rules make sense if you think about what's happening on the farm. And I must say that the various happenings in the game produce a lot of lively farm-related trash talk. Mechanically, Agricola is an excellent game, but for me it's the combination of those mechanics and the theme that make it really fun.

This is easily my favorite Euro that I've played. And, unlike some of the other "heavy" Euros I like, I've found it to be approachable enough to play with casual gamers, at least in 2-3 player games. Thus, I'll get to play this more often than something like T&E. 

Great game all around, highly recommended.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game on iOS with over 100 plays.

My first few plays fell really flat. The game was dry and difficult. I stuck with it and started using the cards, which added variety and excitement to the game. Balancing feeding, growing, and upgrading is so rewarding.

I loved the game so much that I preordered Caverna, which is also a great game. But there is still something great about Agricola, so I ended up with a second hand copy, just in case ;)

I love this game. Even though I often enjoy seeing the fruits of my economic engines I still like the very limited actions you get in Agricola. I like how the possible actions are fewer at the beginning so as not to overwhelm, then gradually adds more choices as the game progresses. I like that I can play the family version with my kids while playing the advanced version with my gamer friends. I even like the cute little farm you end up with by the end.

This is my favourite game of all time. I enjoy building my own farm and looking for ways of efficiency. I enjoy planning my actions based on the specific advantages offered by the occupations and investment cards. I also like that you have to do the best you can, while also finding a way to produce enough food for your family. Some players find this stressful, but I like that the game forces you to find efficient moves that allow you to feed well and also expand your farm. End result of your farm gives a sense of achievement.

Many folk don't, but I enjoy Misery Farm. 
It's a vicious unforgiving experience where, as winter sets in, you're often forced to slaughter a beloved family pet for food. "17th century subsistence farming - the game". 
But I like the feeling of achievement where, win or loose, if you've planned well you can leave the game feeling your family is likely to survive and maybe even prosper. 
Until the Black Death sweeps through Europe again of course...

Although my initial play six months ago was a boring, three-hour affair during which I was extremely underwhelmed, my second play was much more tense and exciting. Maybe my change in opinion resulted from a lack of downtime, two players instead of four, and using Occupations and Minor Improvements instead of the Family Variant. Whatever the reason, I greatly enjoyed my play of Agricola. One of these times, I'm even going to win. Just wait. You'll see. :D 

Edit: I won! I really did! :)

RATING: 10
I could blather a lot about how brilliant of a game Agricola is, but you've likely heard it all before.  I believe it takes the "worker placement" mechanic to the highest level of any game I've yet played.

This game also gets a big nod because of an eminently playable solo version.  In fact, some argue that the solo version is as enjoyable as playing against others.

The interaction with other players is largely limited to the worker placement mechanic - blocking their desired move.  There's also a bit of a "pass card to left" mechanic, but it's very minor and does not occur in every game - or even every other game.  I do like a bit more player interaction than Agricola provides.

The biggest challenge with us in terms of Agricola is total time - the time to set up, the time to play, and the time to put away.  With two young children at home, it's fairly rare for us to find time to do this, so instead we often save Agricola for game nights with friends.

I like this game, but I never seem to be in the mood to play it. I think that's telling. 

It's so tight that it's more puzzle than game. It's a fantastic puzzle, but I find the only real path to victory is diversification. That's good for what it is. 

I always like it when I play, and my brain feels tired afterward.

I am still trying to master this.  This game takes some getting used to in the way they you never seem to have enough actions to do everything that you want to do (they are right when they say this) -- and it is terribly annoying at times.  Still, it is fun in trying to build the best farm.  I have played in spurts mostly -- binge, then retirement to the shelf for a while, then back to binge.    Unbelievably, I have YET to win a game!  I will persist in trying though.

RATING: 8
Clever interaction of time and resource management that makes running a preindustrial farm fun rather than tedious. As usual you have too much to do and not enough workers to do it - unless they build a spare room to house the kiddy and take a day off to... well, you know. It's a very different game from Uwe Rosenberg which, none the less, has the virtues of his designs - clever idea at the core (the expanding list of actions and the choice of expanding your family to take full advantage of them at the risk of having the one action you need stolen by another player), fairly quick player turns (play a worker, take the action), victory conditions that force diversification of strategy and intricate interactions between the action cards.

Juego duro y largo pero con una sensación de vértigo en el que parece que no da tiempo a nada y con una agonía casi constante por alimentar a la familia.

the cards don't add replayability as much as they add randomness (not overpowering randomness, but they do cripple a lot of the "figure out what the other people need" part of the game- which is the primary form of interaction.  any time you could be blocked, you can almost always fix your bad play with the cards).  my rating drops 2 points when playing with the cards. the "family game" is the better way to play for gamers.  

and when playing it without cards, this is one of my favorites.  Pushes the boundaries of what you can reasonably parse while still keeping track of your opponents (sitting it right along the edge of challenge:skill for me, making it highly enjoyable), with heavy interaction if you actually understand the game.

Probably my favorite game. Really love the re-playability, as every game is quite different. It's unfortunate that I haven't logged my number of plays, as it's probably my most played game. I would guess I've played multiplayer 15-20 times, and probably another 20 solo games. I've also played the iOS version about 100 times or more. 

I love the fact there are so many cards you can add to the main game. That keeps the variability/re-playability up even that much more. I've added some of the additional decks but haven't broken them out yet for a game. Usually when we play there is a new person, which makes it hard to do things like drafting. 

I picked up Farmers of the Moor but yet try it out with the base game yet.

I find this one of the most stressful games I own! It's like, "Aaaaaaah I can't get enough wood and if I don't plough another field I'll be in trouble and my family are going to starve and I'm going to looooose" up until the last couple of Rounds when your plan finally comes together (hopefully). And maybe you still lose. Sometimes it's hard to tell if this game is fun or not! 

But I like the animeeples and the farming a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Most of my plays of this game have been two-player games.  With two players, I always feel like our games devolve into a battle for wood.  Because wood is so scarce, it's possible to get frozen out completely, in which case the game is really not very enjoyable.  Of course, a solid strategy is to deny your opponent access to the wood, but doing so makes things quite contentious.  It's still fun, but the angst caused by this kind of game really detracts from my opinion of Agricola as a two-player game.

I am a bit puzzled about all the good ratings this game has received on boardgamegeek.
Granted:The game comes with a lot of nice components, but game play is actually quite boring, since there is almost no inter-action between the players. You are more or less exclusively concerned with your own board, there is almost no communication or even 'conflict' in the game.
The cards that you are dealt with at the beginning, more or less determine what you can do.
The theme is just not my cup of tea.
My rating is a 3.

So far, it's an interesting puzzle. I've only played this one solo family game so far to get the feel for gameplay...its a bit fiddly, but I'm looking forward to trying out the cards.  The biggest knock so far is that I'm having a hard time gauging how successful I'm being (mid-game) because of the non-intuitive scoring. 

Tried a couple more 2p games with my wife both family games....I won the first, but my wife creamed me the second.  

Tried the cards out, the first non-family version of the game.  I tried to formulate a strategy around my cards and it just tanked the rest of my game.  I'm overthinking this game...with too many plans and not enough family members to carry them out.  I need to find an efficient gameplan and how best to maximize my plays.  I think I could play this 100 times and still be striving to improve.  A really good game.

Definately worthy of the hype.  Each play is different due to the number of different card combinations, and the game has a different feel to it based on the number of players in the game.

Manage your farm and grow your family. Agricola intrigued me despite the fact that I naturally shy away from hype. Then the hype got even more annoying. But now that I've played it a few times, I completely understand the fascination. Agricola is deep but above all really fun. The game also appealed to my spouse and several of my friends. I can see how the cards make it infinitely replayable (and expandable!). Agricola has this nagging ability to stick with you as well - I mull over my games well after they're done. Seems to me that the "Agricola phenomenon" is real.

moo?  We decided to pick up Le Havre first.

baa-aa-aa-aah.  We decided to pick this up.  It's still hard for me to wrap my limited brains around the game.

I think this one's still a 7 primarily because we haven't played it enough to really get a feel of how the options play out.

We still haven't played this enough to get past the randomness of the card draws.  I think it may be stuck at seven because this old fart can't seem to get around the card draws and do something useful.

This has fallen to a six.  I just can't get past spending so much time playing the game when a player can just get lucky in a 14 card draw at the beginning.  I like the game, but Le Havre seriously kicks the crap out of it for me.

Provisional rating, after just one play of the 'family' game. I'm not a great fan of the action-selection mechanism at the heart of Agricola (and recently Caylus and Pillars of the Earth, to name but two).  First, it's unthematic (if you choose to bake bread in your oven, why can't I do so too?) and more seriously second, for each moment of pleasure when I take a thing I need, there are several of frustration and dismay when you take the thing I needed also.  Still, I liked Agricola better than either Caylus or Pillars, and look forward to playing the Full version.

I can certainly appreciate this game, it's unquestionably solid.  It just doesn't hit me right.  I don't enjoy the stress element of how dire feeding your family is, and the scarcity of options.  Wanting to do SO much, and only being able to do a little is not much fun for me.

It's certainly personal preference, but I enjoy the paired down All Creatures Big and Small much more, and Tzolk'in overall if I want a meatier experience.

I love the variety of the cards which gives everyone an different approach to start the game.
As far as I see at the moment, the card draw at the beginnging doesn't dominate the game - which is the common fear when seeing this mechanic.
Be aware not to rely too much on your cards and fall short of actions to improve elsewhere.

What I also like is, how differently it plays with changing player numbers.

This one is a highly tactical, optimize your points game- So far: brilliant game.

Update: After some more plays and some time, there are other games which interests me more nowadays. Agricola tends to value wood too high, while other ressources are less valuable.

great game.  tough choices, and i feel like I'm losing before we even start.  doubt ill ever truly tire of this one.  there are lots of engine building games, but here you have to build 2 engines as you go, and each is at the expense of the other.  fantastic.  

edit: I've played Caverna once, and I don't think it's as good as Agricola, and it won't replace it for me.  I like the gric theme better (dwarves that farm didn't do it for me), and I like getting different cards each game (gric) better than the full slate of tiles (cave).

Good game with a variety of strategies.  Cards don't change the game as much as most people think, and the game can occasionally play more like multi-sided solitaire.

RATING: 10
Agricola is amazing. We have played it with a wide range of people. People who aren't that into board games have enjoyed it. People who love board games adore it.  In our opinion it is not that complicated - we play it with the 2 sets of cards right away with new players and they get it.  If they don't you can always go to the family version.  

Don't use the rules to explain it show them with a couple of farms as demos. Once you play a few times it becomes second nature. It's a pretty basic concept after all: build your farm and feed your family. Just get the rules down and you will want to play again and again and again. 

The more you play the more things suggest themselves to you and you wind up trying out all kinds of different things.  Thinking about what to do, being thwarted, switching plans mid-gear, experimenting all add to the fun.   I think the timing might be slightly off at 30 minutes per person it seems it takes a bit longer especially in 2 player version - but on the other hand that doesn't matter because time flies when you're playing it.  In fact it seems the final round is always there before you know it.  Highly recommended.

After 20+ 2p games and a handful at 4p, I can say I was wrong to resist trying this for so long. My preferences are more toward games with strong and direct conflict, but other player's positions and actions are very much relevant. While every game moves toward the same basic goal, proximity to that goal and the path to get there varies in each game due to card draws.

Good game but there is a problem with the turn-order selection, particularly in a 5-player game. A person who sits to the right of 1 or more players who agressively pursue early turn order may end up with poor selections over and over again and an inability to access first turn order.

After first inspection, the game seems great, but you will eventually discover that the game has a fatal flaw.  Sometimes just dealing out the minor improvements and occupations will win the game for someone, as there are combinations that are just too powerful.

One solution to this is to draft occupations.  Another is play with the Farmers of the Moor expansion.

Personally, I prefer to play Le Havre (which I've rated 9.5) or Ora Et Labora (I've rated 9.8) instead.   In my opinion, those are superior games.

I can see lots of problems with this game - largely based on the initial cards you're given.  I believe this is dealt with in the expansions and the designer definitely addresses this in his later titles (Le Havre, etc).  Still, I really enjoy this worker placement game.

RATING: 6
This was hard to rate because I enjoyed "learning" the game a lot (the first couple of plays), as well as the solo play (initially), but I feel it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast.
The major fail for me is the scoring system and the fact that while there are multiple paths to "sustainance" (vegetables/bread/animals...), in the end there are not really different paths to victory: everyone must do a bit of everything; I much prefer a game where there are very "distinct" yet balanced paths to victory (shipping vs building in Puerto Rico would be the poster-child).
it's a long game and when I'm done playing I always feel like I had to make more actions due to the game constraints (be it for feeding, or needing resources for house/famillly growth, or to comply with scoring) than startegy-oriented and stratgey-rewarding choices.

[+] a lot to do but everything makes sense, good mechanics, art, components (theme is rather boring to me but I can understand many people like it), I like the tension around food
[-] very fiddly between rounds (have to add 1/2 resources on each card... that's why I'll play exclusively on iOS), very strange scoring, takes multiple plays to get to know the cards that will come up (it's important) and understand the "value" of each resource/spot and "timing"/flow of the game; I always feel the endgame is boring, not much to do in the last round(s) except getting stuff to comply with the scoring... plus counting up points just at the end (fiddly in itself) is pretty anti-climactic as well.
the more players there are, the more it feels that everyone is just playing sub-optimally, because everyone will have to do a bit of everything (due to the scoring system), and not everyone can do everything at the best moment, so in the end everyone scores "low" and the winner is the one that scored the less low (instead of the highest)

Solo play: I enjoyed playing a couple of solo series (when you have to reach 50, 55, 60...pts and keep 1 permanent card after each win); unfortunately just like the game itself, the best part of playing the solo serie are the early choices you make (what card to save in the 1st 3 solo games), after that the games start to feel very same-y, repetitive, tension-lacking and pretty random when you have to score 65+/70+ pts, having a couple minor improvements that score points is a huge help (but randommely drawn so...)

play on iOS, enjoyed for a bit, but became repetitive fast. I suspect additional decks are the answer but I'm not convinced.

One of many classic board games from that weird time in the 2000s when players were rewarded for skillfully drawing better, more synergistic cards than anyone else.

RATING: 5
A game where you throw out Plan A, B, C, etc. and shoot for Plan R since everyone has already thrown off all the previous plans. 

Gamebreaking cards are what really knocked this game for me. Some will get dealt awesome cards, others terrible ones. But your chance at winning over the next 2-3 hours is heavily decided on these cards dealt before the game begins.

Each turn takes far too long, namely because there are far too many options in front of the player.

I have gotten less enthused with this game with every play.  I find it to be an exercise in frustration every time.  I feel severely hindered by the other players in a way which really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Usually, I like player interaction, but in this game it really bothers me.  Perhaps it's the theme?  It doesn't make much sense that only one player can plow a field, or have kids.  God forbid two women in this imaginary civilization get pregnant at the same time, [i]because clearly the entire world will implode[/i].  Feeding my family isn't fun, it's annoying.  The points system is an arbitrary endgame falsehood.  The cards are annoying.  Everything about this production is what's wrong with Euros.  This game is not worth the hype.  Sigh.

One of the reasons I play board games, is to escape life. Agricola is too much like life for me to enjoy. You look around and see all the cool actions that you could do, but most of your actions will be focused on just keeping your family fed. With Agricola, like life, you scratch out a meager existence on your farmyard until that final harvest. I really like the components and the idea of the game, but man, is it frustrating. Maybe I'm just terrible at it. And now that I have Caverna, I see no need to ever play this again.

If you're wondering, I have played this game more times than I can remember.

You're building the same farm every game folks! Braindead scoring system forces most games to end up looking nearly identical, everyone gets some of everything, cows, sheep, wood, veggies, pastures, stables... Cards provide illusion of depth, but just changes what your workers provide vs cards. IE, one card gives you stone, so your worker goes on cows. Next game a card helps with cows, so your worker goes on stone, etc.

The game is tolerable with house rules that fix the silly scoring system, but still too samey to play more than once a year.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I generally like worker placement and economic games.  I also like the fact that there are so many things to do. I think that the cards are interesting, but it can be frustrating that you really can't play very many of your occupations if you want to do well. 

The game is attractive, and I like the overall flavor and farming theme.  

There can be a little too much detailed calculation.

RATING: 10
LOVE agricola, but it is very hard for new players to get into, even with "family" variant. Scoring is not apparent until you play the game at least once. It's confusing to have references to actions that aren't on the field yet - I have to constantly explain to puzzled looks of newbies "that will be available later".

Basically it's a great game if you manage to get into it, but it's very easy to get bored over the introductory playthrough.

Bonus for wooden animal meeples, those things are adorable.

This game is so well balanced that after 50+ games it's still challenging to think of a winning strategy when you get your 14 starting cards.

Agricola has the strongest theme I have ever seen in a game: every thing you do makes sense. Mechanics are fun and never annoying, and present you plenty of meaningful choices.

Games with >3 people tend to be a bit too long for me though. When playing boardgames 2h are enough for me.

Played a pasted up copy (thanks Brian F.) - and jumped right past the "family game version".  I was playing 3 others who had each played previously and was trying to observe what they were doing, BUT that is tough in a game like this with so many different ways to score and so many different card combinations possible.  For the sheer fact that the replayability is exponentional and it can be played solo, I'd like to own this one.  1/2 hour per person seems about right - maybe a little less if everyone has played and restocking goes quickly.

Un juego realmente bien diseñado, en el que la mecánica se adapta perfectamente al tema. Jugado sin cartas sería un juego de 8. Jugado con cartas en un juego de 10.

Lo peor... no creo que tenga nada malo, quizás que jugando con cartas unos jugadores pueden tener más suerte que otros, o lo farragoso que resulta tanto componente y tanta reposición de recursos, pero vamos, que son males menores.

Az eddigi játékok során úgy sem sikerült 1-nél több új munkást szereznem, hogy csak ketten játszottunk, míg az internet tele van 4-5 emberes partik fotóival, ahol szinte mindenki 4 családtaggal nyomul... nem jöttem még rá a helyes csapásirányra na!

RATING: 8
Rated after four games. After the first every-deck-and-rule-in-the-box game I was "Awwwhhh", after the second family-game-with-nothing-extra I was "Yeaah" and then the third and fourth game with four players and some cards I was still "Yeah". I think that it is good to play the first couple of games with family game and simpler rules and then use the advanced things step by step. This seems to be a good game, I'd like to play this more, once I played the basic game. After couple of games (with good experience), this could even be 9.

I really like the intuitive game mechanics - the things you think would be good to do on a farm bring you points and so on. The game mechanics is good, after that it is a matter if you like to game or not.

The latest game was a two player game with E- and I-decks and my feeling is still "Yeah", very clever game.
The latest latest game was with two players with all the decks, still yeah. Once you get the basic mechanics and learn to use cards after couple of games, then it doesn't really matter how many decks or cards are included.
The latest play at the moment was four player family game, still yeah!

Add six two player plays with family rules during one weekend and you can still hear me yeah! So many plays with family rules make me want to play with cards, the options and tactics are quite limited with family rules especially with two players.

Four more family plays with two players, getting tougher, waiting for the cards. Also, we have played the starting player square a little bit wrong, need to be careful in the future.

One four player play with family rules. I was too tired to enjoy or focus, but still a good game.

My favourite game of all time. One can feel how much time and effort went into designing this. Who would have thought that farming can be a theme that draws people in? The cards really make this work. I wish I could play with my group more often, but knowing this can easily take over 2 hours with 4 players is not something that makes us put this on the table every week.

I love this game. Only purchased it a few days ago but have already played a heap of solitaire games, and two-player games with my girlfriend.

It works great as a solitaire game and I'm currently up to game 3 of the 8 games series. It's a very safe game to play with a partner as well because their isn't much direct competition :)

I haven't tried it with 3 - 5 players yet, but will be very soon.

Despite Uwe Rosenberg evolving the design into games with higher "fun factor" (Caverna, Fields of Arle), I still love the original.  I love the tightness of the design; also the simplicity, everything just makes sense.  The limited choices that Agricola holds over Caverna and Arle make it a really intense experience.  I also love the variability the cards introduce.  Not sure if I prefer this over Rosenburg's other designs, but Agricola still sets itself apart.

When my friend lent my friend and I this game, i didn't realized what amazing thing he had done for us. This past year I just started getting into modern board games and after playing this lovely game, I now know what a heavy eurostyle game is like and I just LOVE IT! So much replay ability, starting with 14 minor improvement and occupation cards makes it a heavy strategy game that has me drooling each time it ask to be played. I definitely deserves to be in the top ten overall games.

This one was worth the wait. I rated it at a 9 at first but after 14 plays I raised it to a 10. My first 5 player full game with all the E cards put me over the top. Until then I had only had family games and a few 2 player full games. ...I drank the Kool Aid and it was good. *update 12/31/08* Setup time and play time hurt this. It's still a great game but it can also be a frustrating game. I'm lowering my rating to a 9. Game length and setup time has me lowering this to an 8 now.

Really fun game, but I never feel like I accomplish that much in a standard play! We've taken to adding homebrew rules wherein we play one of the stages twice, just so that our farms are a bit more robust at the end (we've found this a bit more satisfying)

RATING: 7
** Rating decreased to 6 after playing ACBAS and Caverna. I prefer games where I can plot my moves without thinking 'how do I feed, how do I feed' every single turn.

***

Rating increased from 7 to 9.5 after further plays with the Minor/Major improvement cards. I generally hate procedural economic euros, but this one is so thematically consistent, cheery and charming (especially with my custom Fimo meeples) that I can't help loving it.

***

A thematically-strong farming simulation. If you enjoy Farmville or Nintendo's Harvest Moon series of computer games, you'll enjoy this.

Agricola falls over itself to be welcoming to a variety of player groups with, for example, rules for a simpler family variant included in the box.

The game is easy to learn because the theme is consistent with the mechanics. The rule book is colourful and easy to understand. 

Despite the lack of combat, Agricola is surprisingly interactive. You can stop other players getting the resources they need because only one player can take the same action each turn. What's more, you can physically see their farm and family growing five-strong in a stone mansion while you struggle to feed two wooden discs in a straw house.

The cards and bits are attractive with appealing cartoony graphics. The card stock is thick and rugged. My only question is why they provided unshaped wooden cubes/discs for the sheep, farmers, etc. Surely the budget could have stretched to shaping the meeples. I'm going to make some pieces from Fimo.

Finally got to try this. Quite simple despite the awful rulebook. Meh! 80% fiddly "bookkeeping" and reading all the different cards. 20% gameplay.

As much interaction and things to do and shovelling shit as if actually living on a small farm in the middle of fecking nowhere.

As an 'antidote' to the plethora of UK Expo play-test games, I was invited to try a this board game about farm and homesteading in central Europe in the late seventeenth century and has nothing to do with the Roman general. Not versed in Latin, it was explained to me that the Roman general's family were farmers -
hence the game title - so I considered myself thankful for having learned another piece of information in one game session. The rules were well-explained, but not overdone, so that enabled the three of us who had not played before to pick up the mechanics fairly easily.  

Making farming exciting was always going to be a tough ask, as it is not a theme that I'd rave about, but I was prepared to try it and it does have multiple strategy options which is good from the perspective of long-term playbility. Each player (farmer)  begins with a wooden shack with your spouse (no partnerships back then) and little else. There are two actions allowable to each farmer - one for each of his own piece and that of his spouse - although the patter of tiny feet is never far away as this procreation was certainly the winning strategy of our game. these can include collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. 

Rolling around in muck and worrying about starvation are clearly fun things from that era....Before children can be provided for, each farmer needs to extend his house to allow one room for each person, although interestingly the mechanics encourage sharing rooms with an assortment of available farm animals. I did not think it was that kind of game until the context of homes of multiple occupancy is taken on board.....Make no mistake, kids are only born out of love and affection, not for use as slave labour to toil on your farm, because that would be entirely inappropriate, and those cold nights leave you with idle hands otherwise....

No children were overworked during the course of our game as only one player maximised his family with  three children but let's not read too much into that cold nights thing. The range of game options cover a whole host of other things like going to market, building hovel improvements and taking up new occupations, which in my case were as a consultant and yokel priest, both of which distracted me from my duties of farming, muck-raking and procreation, but not necessarily in that order! A facet of the game I do like, in spite of the theme, is that it does make you think about trying differing combinations of activity selections next time.

So, I would try this game again, for sure. It would not be one where I would claim, "That was Agricola. Let us never speak of it again". Honest. Two features that are very important to the game are both the  minor Improvements, and as already mentioned, occupations, where each farmer starts with six each of these. There is a degree of randomness as to their comparative uses, although in fairness, that is part of discovering the range of cards and combining them with the strategies suggested by the occupations available. to you. Agricola is a turn-based game spread over fourteen turns so it is a finite time and each farmer will take x number of actions according to the number of family members they have in their family hovel. 

Harvests occur during the course of the game, and this is when you pray to heaven that there is enough food to go round, so as a first time player, I made sure i had enough to the detriment of other strategies but a beggar I was not. Glad I spelled that word correctly.....These occur on the fourth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth and fourteenth turn ends. One key aspect of the game is that each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference, and taking the first player option is one tactic to ensure this as it means the greatest choice. There are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand, and others on your experience playing the game. 

Certainly a game with layer upon layer of strategies.

Although after many plays some aspects of the game have begun to feel scripted, there is always that joy of being dealt 14 cards and seeing what you can do with them.

OK, so is this game all that, or is it just hype?  The way folks are going on and on about it, you'd think this was Jesus in boardgame format, and that this was his second coming.  Make it a little scarce, give it some exclusivity with some pre-release bonuses, etc., and you've created the perfect storm for a bunch of boardgaming geeks.  But how is it, REALLY?

Truth be told, it's not bad.  It has an interesting system, which reminds me a bit of Puerto Rico with its role selection, a bit of Pillars of the Earth with its placement system, and a bit of Age of Steam with the angst that comes about from timing when to pick the best role, based on the timing of the game and what others can do before it gets back to your turn.  It's tight and squeezy, which are two things that I like in my games.  If the game is punishing you and you're still struggling to stay afloat, then it's a good game.

Another good thing going for this game is its replayability.  At most, you're only ever going to see 70 cards per game, and there are 372 cards between the decks.  That the selections change slightly with different numbers of players gives the game that much more of a lifetime, and I can see this game being fresh and enjoyable for many, many plays.

I'm not keen on it as a 2-player game, just because the choices are so limited.  You have to understand how weird it is for me to say that; usually, I don't like games as they creep up toward the upper end of the player limit, because the added players tend to add a lot of chaos.  With Agricola, though, the added choices for the additional players make a big difference in what you can plan to do.  With only one space to collect wood, clay, and reed, respectively, it makes your choices only that much more critical, and it sometimes leaves you with some very suboptimal choices to make.  That being said, the game is balanced well with 2 players, so it's hard to criticize that version of the game, since clearly a lot of thought was put into its development.  It's just not much to my tastes.

I have a minor gripe with the primary strategy of the game changing each game, due to the random card draw.  It's easy to see one player get the cards needed to get some tremendous engine going, while someone else in the game gets a handful of random cards that don't meld together as easily.  It might throw the balance of the game off, but time will tell.

It ain't Jesus, but it's at least the Pope.

Having played it now with another player (the first 4 plays were solo), i think that it is just great! For Worker Placement Game-lovers, you are going to love this one.

I enjoy this game alot.  Always lots of tough decisions with multiple strategies and cards that work better together then other cards.  You simply won't have time to excel at everything which is what makes the game great.  It is OK playing the family version but I enjoy the Full version much more.  The problem with this is getting people together that have played it before so you can play the full version.  Being a 2+ hour game we mostly don't have time to play twice when other games are around

After several plays, I've come to realize that this one just doesn't do it for me.  Don't get me wrong; I will play it if it's dragged out.  

However, I require much more theme than this game has - non-existent in my opinion, - and I tend to feel like I haven't "completed" the game at the end.  I don't know how else to explain it.  This, more often than not, frustrates me and is fairly prevalent in Euro-style engine efficiency games.

Agricola is a decent game, and I loved it the first few times I played it, but after that initially positive reaction I found myself enjoying it less and less with each play because it feels unnecessarily fiddly and convoluted.

A brain burner for sure.. just the way I like them. It seems though that the drunker I am when I play it, the more I own people :)

As I have been gaining experience with a number of board games, I've come to realise one of the greatest strengths of this game - sustained suspense, the quality that makes a 2+ hour session go by in a flash, simply due to the fact that it's so exciting from the word go.

Other games have clever systems, yes, but their suspense factor fails. Take Power Grid, for example (a past favourite of mine). Unless there is a slave driver relentlessly announcing each step in each turn or unless the players are remarkably disciplined, the game breaks down into a cacophony of non-game related chatter. Now, I know some people don't mind this, but I personally prefer to focus on the game itself and chat later, when it's over.

I have played this game only five or six times so far, but it already seems quite engaging. Two of those plays were two-player games, one with the "family" variant, and one with the (easy) cards. I suspect that most players will want to use some sort of card-drafting mechanism for games that involve more than two or three players, as some card-combinations are clearly advantageous, and it's possible to get saddled with card-draws that give you a bunch of poorly matched cards. Still, the game seems excellently developed, and is filled with tension and challenge (and the immediate pondering afterwards about "where things went wrong" and "how I could have done better").

A great workerplacement variant. The mechanism to explore as many options during your turn, makes it easier to score an acceptable number of points. The beauty is a between mechanic and theme. Critism about this play, is the expected move during the game, some actions aren't that strong and you have to have some luck to use an action at the right time. This can be countered if you create more than 5 options during your turn, to be sure to make another strong move. Not a game for a beginner

An interesting resource management game.  Simultaneously a lengthy game but also often feels like it ends just as you're starting to get the payoff from all the investment you put into infrastructure throughout the game.

It takes a long time to set up and you can get messed up by RNG pretty easily with the dependence on good occupations and such but that can potentially be fixed with a home rule for a kind of drafting system to start up the occupations.

I admit that I dismissed this game because the theme seemed very drab. Farming? in the 13th century? How can this possibly be fun. I'm glad to report that I was proven 100% wrong. 

There is a lot of game in this box. We've only played the "family" version so far and the group was loving it. We can't wait to try out the "full" version. The only complaint I have is the non-inclusion of the veggie/resource/ani-meeples. I **seriously** recommend forking out the cash to get a set of those. It makes the game much more fun.

Having now played at higher player counts I realise where this game really shines. It is fantastic, I really think the only way to play is by drafting at the start. The only thing that holds this back for me at the moment is the scoring system, I wish there was a slightly more intuitive system for this.

Although I have no real inclination to play it again, I'd probably rate it higher with more plays. I admit that I've only played Agricola once with other players. I played an ostensibly multiplayer game in silence. That's my biggest problem with the game. I guess I prefer games that enable me to chat with my friends when they're there. Even other optimisation games, like chess, have a chattier atmosphere. [geekurl=/thread/1519124/agricola-nutshell]For a better explanation of the feel of Agricola see the nutshell review.[/geekurl]

I have the iPad app - I thought there must be something more to this game that other ppl like so much - I still don't want to play the game. I'll have another go at the app later.

The Rahdo runs through videos helped me appreciate the game more. The planning at the start seems to be key.

I'm wondering if I like farming games like [gameid=63759] because they don't require me to think about farming chores. Or perhaps learning the rules seemed like doing chores. I'm not sure. It might just be aspects of the theme, rather than the game itself.

In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
\13\\13\
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).
Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
\13\\13\
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference.
Each player also starts with a hand of 7 job cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 item cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.

One of my favourite games. It's interesting until the end and you have to choose carefully which actions you gonna take. A lot of variation with the different occupation and minor improvement cards. The actions are adapted to the number of players.

RATING: 8
Agricola is a strange beast. The theme is, at first glance, far from exciting. The mechanics are pretty dry (fill up the board with cubes, take turns removing them) and the game's scoring can be brutally unforgiving. It's been tossed around here on the geek (Originally by Tom Vasel, I believe...) that a game of Agricola isn't a competition to take the best action available but instead revolves around a race to make the selection that will hurt you the least. That has certainly been the case in my experience, as there are just too many things that need your attention and not enough time to get them done. That does add plenty of tension, but not everyone enjoys it when the tension crosses over into stress. Agricola comes close to doing that at times. As a result, some people are less than enthusiastic to see it on games day, because to them, it feels too much like work.

The strangest part about Agricola is that despite all these intense and punishing moments, the game can still appeal to one's sense of make-believe. Even considering all of the unrealistic game mechanics (Seriously? Only one person in the whole village gets to chop wood at a time?), it still FEELS like you're running a farm...and for some reason, that's a lot of fun.

The cards are the game's most interesting feature. There are hundreds and you only get to use a small fraction of them in any particular game. This let's you approach each play with a slightly different set of tools to use in conquering the game's challenges. I think this is the reason Agricola has enjoyed such a meteoric rise up the BGG ranks. The cards are an extremely clever way to add almost infinite variety to what would have been a very simple and one-dimensional experience without them. I expect more games to follow suit, as the concept is a good one.

Who would've thought a game about farming could be this much fun? The resources are somehow at the perfect balance; they're tight enough that you can never really do everything you want, but loose enough that I've never seen anyone involuntarily take a begging card. The metagame about getting in opponents' heads is great fun, and the cards take a game that probably would've gotten stale and give it a huge amount of replayability. It's deep enough to satisfy gamers, but intuitive enough that I've been able to play it with non-gamers and have them enjoy it. About the only downside to it is that it's very fiddly, easy to make mistakes during setup and between rounds, and difficult to have more than one person laying things out, so that downtime is a little higher than would be ideal.

This game is an entertaining, brain-burning simulation of farming.

RATING: 10
I think this is the finest game ever designed.  It's all about the cards, and the endless deployability they provide.  You should always do some sort of draft to take advantage of them.

I do very much dislike how important the race for the first family growth is.  I mean, I really, really dislike it and applaud Caverna's way of ameliorating it.

I also dislike how the end game scoring discourages specialization.  The result is that everyone's farm ends up looking roughly the same.

Despite those flaws, my brain is on fire the whole time I play Agricola.  I love the tension it provides and how strategic it is.

Nitty gritty worker placement. The 'feeding your family' aspect makes this pretty brutal if you aren't ready for the challenge. Farming theme suits me just fine, but could be dull. Game really opens up with the addition of various included decks. Not for everyone, but a technically fantastic game.

Under review. I like Agricola. Do I like it enough? I don't know.

Edit: this may be replaced with the family edition which is posed as having reduced complexity - I'd say it has been streamlined and may let players focus a little less on minutiae.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game about creating a farm from scratch with a lot of variety and freedom, but with so many options to peruse AP becomes a problem.  You can muck a person's game with mean-spirited worker placement, but that is essentially it for player interaction.  With scoring happening only at the end of the game, it's not easily apparent how well anyone is doing.  Not keen on the scoring that forces everyone to have a little of everything.  The game is rather long, but feels like it ends abruptly.  Perhaps more plays will ease the AP and speed things up, but the lack of interaction will remain.

Great game! One of the euro's with a theme that really works. It's a favorite of one of my daughters because of the theme. She feels like a farmer and she loves animals:). And now she wants the expansions Farmers of the Moor because of the horses. She adores horses:). This expansion makes the Family game even better!

It's a favorite at my gaming club, points getting higher and higher... It's all about maximizing your build up in this game and not losing points. My type of game for pure amusement, not my type of game in winning. I don't mind, some games are fun even if it means end last :)

Great decisions to be made. Do you pursue the strategy allowed to you by randomized setup, prepare to make the most of harvests, or take advantage of an unusually efficient action?

The game can be punishing if you don't get your farm running before harvests begin to accelerate.

Not a fan of solo and two player isn't tight enough.

Update: Shine is off now, and I still like it, but the end game always plays out too similarly for my liking.  This needs more differentiation.  The cards are also wildly imbalanced in too many cases (mostly there are too many useless cards).
----------------------
So far so good.  Wish there was a bit more uncertainty/variety in the basic actions (and speak of the devil, the seasons expansion helps a bit with this), but I understand the choice.  The huge variety of cards and potential combos is just fantastic; more euros need this kind of expansiveness.  More strategic variation would improve the game, as there's a bit too much clustering to achieve a balanced approach.

I don't ever see this being a 10 for me, but it's very good, very tight, just a few personal nits here and there.

The least beginner friendly game ever. Well ok thats an exaggeration but I bought this game because it made the top of the dice tower most popular games list for a year and for me figuring out how to play and all the little pieces were very unintuitive

RATING: 9
After reading the hype on this game for over a year on BGG, my first play left me extremely disappointed.  I expected something mind-blowingly original, something that felt unlike anything I'd ever played before.  Instead, it felt like just another worker placement game.

Once I got past that initial disappointment, however, I realized that, mind-blowing though it may not be, it is a very good worker placement game.

The game has a nice complexity.  It's complex enough to feel deep and mechanically interesting while simple enough to teach new players without making their heads explode.  I think this is largely thanks to the good integration of theme--aside from the worker placement aspect (which is easy to explain on its own), most of the way the game works can be easily hung on thematic hooks.  This is how theme should work in Eurogames.

Overall, a very good game that I'm still enjoying immensely, and one that should keep hitting the table for quite a while.

OK I greatly appreciate the level of complexity to this game and the vast number of ways in which you can win. But it's so dry.... It's probably less interesting than actual farming (no offense farmers, thanks for the food). I gave it a few tries and I just can't do it, never again.

This is a great game and I so much enjoy this "Harvest Moon" style gameplay. BUT: setting up this game is a real pain as it comes with a trillion cards. My wife likes to play it solitaire.

A masterful worker placement game. I cannot play this game enough. The card play, with the occupations and improvements, provides endless depth and replayability and really is the heart of the game.

My favorite Euro, no doubt.

Phenomenal game, just brilliant. I still think that Agricola is Uwe Rosenberg's magnum opus. And it just keeps getting better with each subsequent play (especially with the Farmers of the Moor and Gamers' Deck expansions added). I love the tightness of this design and the interrelation between the theme and the mechanics - everything is intuitive and makes perfect sense. The best thing about this game is the challenge of managing scarce resources and figuring out the most effective ways of using the cards in your hand. This puzzle is just a fascinating, brain-burning delight. But keep in mind that this is a "I wonder if I can do this better, quicker and more efficiently next time" type of game. Optimization is the heart of Agricola, so if you don't like designs like that, you probably won't enjoy this one. 

By the way, Agricola works exceptionally well as a solo game! It's a really challenging puzzle.

The only drawback I can think of is the constant need for repleneshing goods - this gets a bit too fiddly, especially late game.

On Preorder from Zman - and it sounds like there's a good chance that it'll be with Animeeples!  What about Veggimeeples ;) Agricolated,  and made up my mind to buy it.  Solid game - it's no RftG,  but I guess not everything can have an awesome Sci-Fi Theme...Family game was interesting enough,  looks like it can only get better with the cards.  Hard to say whether the family game can be "solved" though.  

A little bit later,  now with my own copy - game is growing on me (started off pretty good above), gripes mostly limited to the "why wasn't the super starter deck labeled as such" and the post-Stone Age "resources can be different, intuitive shapes!"

Or maybe they should have included a sticker pack...

A bunch of plays later:  A very good game,  the cards keep the mechanisms fresh.  A lot of the cards feel broken,  although the actual benefit of cards is often much less than they appear.  Undoubtedly will swing the game between equally skilled players,  but the experience of building the farm is an interesting exercise in and of itself,  and getting a "broken combo" is just a bit of a bonus.  Active denial of good actions is probably necessary to keep other players in check,  but that starts getting away from the actual fun bit of building your farm...

I don't have many of these 'economic optimisation' games. Normally the objective when we sit down at the table is for everyone to have a great time, and many of my friends find these games a touch confrontational and solitary...hence all the ameritrash seen below :)

One of the first boardgames. Pimped up components. We have never played with the cards and repeated attempts to try this again have crashed into the badly written rulebook. As we now have more experience with worker placement, this might show its teeth..

after my second game , this time in family version, i want to raise the rate to 7.4; Agricola plays well and fast, it didn't seem that complicated this time. the nice thing is that it naturally leads each player to different strategies to reach victory and this is good.
i am still not enthusiast about this game, it doesn't give me the wonderful sensation of a masterwork like El Grande, T&E, Torres.

A very fun game, though difficult to play in german (as any game would be).  There are many options and strategies to try an employ and the cards add play options where there might not be as many.

My first taste of complex euro-gaming. I love Agricola but it's been very difficult to get other people to play it: coming to it new can be particularly overwhelming with everything that is going on. I also find that the occupations and minor improvements can make for an uneven playing field (excuse the pun). I'll play it on iPad every now and then, but I much prefer to play All Creatures Big and Small these days - it strips away the complexity and with just two players it takes a quarter of the time.

Like many people I suspect, I initially avoided this game because it's about 18th century farming which, sorry, sounds really boring.  I let my friend in my weekly game night group go ahead and get this one so I could save my money for the likes of Terra Mystica or 7 Wonders.  However, this game is anything but boring.  It includes all of the elements I look for in games: multiple ways to win, the ability to mess with other players, relatively low luck involved to win (with the exception of the Minor Improvement and Occupation cards), and, most importantly, you don't really know who won until the end of the game, so you don't spend the whole game feeling frustrated rather than having fun.  Right after playing this game I ran out and got Caverna (which I prefer slightly, I know I'm in the minority here).  You can't go wrong with either one. Play this game!

I have only two small complaints about this game.  First and most importantly, players' turns can take a while.  There are so many choices, and every choice means you don't make the other choices; it can result in over thinking.  In a 4-5 player game, I usually see people get distracted when it's not their turn.  
My second complaint is with the game's double-edged sword, the aspect that in the minds of most players puts this game above Caverna.  The random distribution of the Minor Improvement cards and the Occupation cards are usually fun and make the game feel different every time.  But every now and then, one player gets a really killer combo of cards (or I get complete crap!) and it makes the game unfair.  Not terribly unfair, but in a group of skilled gamers, it can decide the winner.  Not always, but I've had it happen.

A classic that works, but Caverna is so much better imo. I dislike that you have to have something of everything, and that there is so much competition over the growth mechanism. But if you have time to learn all the cards and combos, this game will have so much depth and replay ability that almost no game can match.

Agricola is a game I really want to love.  We played it so many times in our game group.  There are a few that do actually love it.  There are others, like me, that really like the ideas and concepts that the game has, but find the game painful more often than not to play.  There are almost always very reasonable ways to make food and get points a variety of different ways so what the game ends up boiling down to most often is who can get the family growth first.  The first two players to get it are highly favored to win in most of the games we have played.  So the first few rounds of the game are people positioning to build the house expansion followed by positioning to family growth.  Once you are behind in this game in workers, it is nearly impossible to come back.  You don't always need to have the most workers to win, but the person that gets the first extra worker often has a very significant advantage.  

Playing with the cards can help, but it can also make the game even more lopsided.  At a 2 hour play time, if you are one of the people behind, you have 1.5 more hours of losing before you get to start another game.  For those in the race for the win, it can be fun.  I'd almost appreciate a player elimination rather than having to play a game for 2 hours that I know is improbable for me to win at that point.  I'm just messing up other peoples chances of winning through what I take rather than actually being able to appreciably increase the chance of me winning.  And yet I still want to like this game...

Luckily there is Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and Caverna.  I think both are a better than Agricola and scratch the same itch.  Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is great for when you have a shorter time period.  I also love that you have a fixed number of workers so there isn't this "action economy" imbalance you have to worry about.  Caverna does better at scratching the same itch as Agricola when you want to play a heavier game.  It plays 2 hours or so, but fixes the issues I have with Agricola.  There are so many options each round, there often isn't a key spot that everyone is fighting for all the time (reed then family growth).  Instead there are lots of routes and timings you can take and still be reasonably in the game without having to a certain thing at a certain time.  I do wish that Caverna had a bit of a randomization more than just the harvest schedule so that each play was a bit more unique and interesting, but I would still play Caverna over Agricola any day.

RATING: 6
In my opinion this games biggest success is also it's biggest failing. The huge assortment of cards make for an interesting and new experience every time but it also brings up balance questions as some cards combo to be nearly unstoppable and some cards are just flat better in every way than other cards.

Sadly I don't believe this game could ever be a 9 or 10 to me due to my frustrations over the imbalance of the cards.

I like this game a lot. You have a various ways of strategies to choose between and no one is better than the other to win. One downside about the game is that you are pretty smoked if you make a mistake in your strategy. If you aren´t equally experienced in the game it will be tough for the beginner to win. But it´s worth a couple of times to be in the loser corner because for every game you finish you just want to play it again.

After three plays, I'm coming to love this game more and more. It's one of the few games that really grips me to the point where I'm on pins to see if I can pull off my plans. It gets my adrenaline going. I'm putting it at a 9 now, but it seems like if it continues like this, it might be a 10.

RATING: 9
Building a farm...nah...it's all about making the most POINTS! You have a farm in front of you and you will make your points through building a type of farm. It uses worker placement and has wood.

The real mettle of this game though, for me, is the cards. The cards that you get at the beginning of the game, the ones that will be a different bunch each time you play. Finding a workable, good combination of the cards is half of the real fun of Agricola...building your farm to get points is the other half.

Together this has truly earned its high status among the BGG crowd. 

More good news...it can be played in an easy, accessible family mode, or in the full throttle mode. It can be enjoyed solo, or with 4-5 more! I have to admit that playing solo is do-able, but not as fun. I suppose one could make that call for any solo-able game though.

In short, it's a good game.

RATING: 7.8
Probably my second favourite board game. Family appears to love it, which is good as there are a lot of non-gamers in it. Would easily recommend this as a gateway game because of the easier to understand family game variant. I very much respect the amount of time and effort gone into playtesting this game.

Main gripe I have is the quality of components. I really don't think It would have been that hard to provide more(especially wood) or to make them look like the intended objects. The fact that people "pimp" their Agricola or make a fuss about getting animeeples says it all.

Comments: I love this game. For me, this is the bench mark for all other resource management euro games. The added variety of occupation cards and minor improvements is staggering.

The theme doesn't quite do it for me, but it does make it more approachable for non-gamers like my wife. Hands down, the most well rounded, challenging, fulfilling and enjoyable game I own!

From my Bokkenrijder 19 Juli 2012

Agricola was my first foray into gaming. I now have an account on BoardGameGeek and a smaller bank account due to all the games I have now purchased, so they must have done something right in Agricola development.

The game has seamless rule construction, and I like that you can still win by using your head, rather than by decimating your opponent. 
 
It is aesthetically lacking, as the plane colored blocks make me feel like I am back in preschool.

RATING: 4
Since resource efficiency games aren't my cup of tea, I hadn't intended to ever play Agricola.  But since I was left with no other options at my last gaming session, I ended up playing it.

In short: The life of a farmer, even with card-driven replayability and a fifth of bathtub hooch, is still the life of a farmer. Seriously, the highlight of my Agricola experience was when I upgraded my fireplace to a kettle.

The copy I played didn't come with crack.  Did everyone else's?

RATING: 7
Lots going on here. To much for me. House, plowed fields, fenced fields, grain and vegetables, number of family members, occupations, minor and major improvements, 3 types of livestock, stables and maybe some other stuff. You have to maximize your farm to the best of your ability. I found it frustrating and I really slow the game down. The learning curve on how to fit everything together will be there. I started seeing how things fit together after about the 6th round of the first family game but still cannot see how all the occupations and improvements work together. Rating after 8 plays over 9 years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played a few times (with 3 to 5 players - as well as a few solo plays). A very interesting game, with many choices, lots of things to do, and an impressive apparent replayability due to the number of different cards. Scalability seems good as well, and the components are very nice. However, the scoring system introduces constraints which I don't like (the penalties for not having a bit of everything are too harsh to ignore), and familty growth is probably too important, both in the game itself and in scoring. There might be concerns with the balance of cards, too, but I haven't played enough to really judge about it.

This game can seem very overwhelming at first, but after you get a few rounds into it things start to flow very smoothly.

Once you get the hang of it, this becomes an excellent game.   Lots of strategy and tons of replay value.  There are thousands of possible card combinations, and because of how the board is set up it becomes a very different game depending on how many players you have - it scales really well from five players all the way  down to just one.

The initial card draws can sometimes be a little unbalancing, so if you don't like that you could do a draft for the cards instead, or forget the cards entirely and stick with the "family game" version of the rules which still provides a great game.

I completely understand the love for Agricola! It's intricate and really smartly designed, there's always a ton of choices and variation.

Un jeu qui devrait sortir sur la table de jeu régulièrement, mais il est légèrement trop stratégique pour ma blonde.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] Let's build a farm, medieval time style. The game keeps renewing itself with all the new features they add in the new decks of cards. This one is in my favorite games. It is a game that should hit the table very often, maybe just a little too tricky so my girlfriend does'nt enjoy it as much as I do.

This is my favorite side-by-side solitaire game, with a heavy bit of "no, that's what I was going to do!"  I like the way your hand of cards changes drastically what you can and might do, and your opponents' choices cause you to completely rethink your plans. No bad games of this yet.

Family game:  Played a 2p with my 8-year-old; he loved it.  Played a 2p with wife; she liked it a lot (and she doesn't play many games).  My initial rating is 8; it has room to go up or down.

I've now played it 6 times (in the first 5 days that I owned it).  My family loves it, and I'm enjoying it too.  The three-player game is noticeably different from the two-player game, and each time we've played the game has proceeded differently.  It remains interesting.  I'm looking forward to playing with some of the decks soon.

Full game:  Played 2 games with the E Deck, one 3p and one 2p.  Definitely more brutal than the family game, but opens up even more possibilities for play.

What has impressed me so far about both the family and full games is that, every time you play, the game feels different.  That the game pulls this off with such a clean rule set is amazing.  Rating up to 9.

10/29/10:  Started to run out of steam with repeated play.  Still a very good game, but not quite a 9.

A very complex game -- not for the weak of heart.

A game of "So much to do, so little time."  Since you can't do everything, you have to pick your battles.  And when people pick what you wanted to do, the tension really builds.

This game gets more intense (read: better) the more people are playing.  Also, playing with the cards is better than the family version.  The cards are what really make the game different from one game to the next.  Also, the more players the better occupations become available.

This game in a word?  Awesometacular.

I really like how this captures the tightness of competitive min maxing, *BUT* defers the scoring and the turgid part of min maxing until the end. Lesson to be learned here in fun...

Also for the economists in the crowd the fact that only one worker can work a role effectively creates a nice model for barrier of entry economics (compared to the terrain competition of roads and boats barrier model which feels like too easy a path of entry to me)

Actually play a few more games than logged here but all of them have been using the family rules so far.

A fantastic game that gets better with each play. Personally, I think the theme is one of the game's strongest points. The mechanics are incredibly well integrated into the theme, and it all just works. As for the game being a struggle... only if you use the max VPs as a baseline and subtract from there, instead of looking at it the other way around. And I love games you can get better at with each play, but can also grasp the strategy through analysis (and in Agricola's case, through solo play as well).

This game is okay, but certainly not as fun as Caverna. The new mayfair version also only has 4 players, as opposed to the 5 player count that the original version had.

Since Caverna allows up to 7 players, and I think the mechanics are better refined in Caverna, you can absolutely skip this one, and just buy Caverna instead.

Game play weight of 'Medium Heavy' for the full game. 'Medium weight' is more appropriate for the family game variant.

The full game demonstrates exactly what type of gameplay elements I love in games. I like games where planning is useful, where you try to be extremely efficient. I like games where you build something from scratch (I like looking at the farms people built at the end of the game). I like where prople can develop different strategies, based on the card they got at the start of the game.

I like the family version less then the full version, not because its bad or less fun to play, but because it makes me want to play the full game continuously. And it keeps reminding me that playing one of my favorites games is sometimes just too taxing for my fellow players :(

Not as complex as it seems, but very thought-heavy. Well designed worker placement with excellent replay value in the cards. Very tight, competitive gameplay. The cards work well to kind of steer you towards a strategy or make certain aspects a bit easier.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is a family favorite. A lot of strategy and replayability.  The 14 random Minor Improvement and Occupation Cards (7 of each) that each player starts with forces you to adjust your strategy with each new game.  The written directions are really a challenge to make sense out of.  We had to go on YouTube and watch a video explanation to figure it out.  The game is deep but not as difficult as the manual may lead you to think at first.  The game actually sat on the shelf for 2 months before I actually forced myself to learn it.  It is a 1 to 5 person game, so you can sit and tinker with it solataire style if you like.  The games are long, but in a sneaky kind of way.  You don't realize how long you've played.  A 2-3 person game is probably doable in a 1.5 to 2 hour timeframe.  4-5 person games can go for 3 hours.  A good party game though, no one gets eliminated, so everyone is in the game the entire time.

I like agricola, but mostly with people who are enthusiastic to play it.  It's not a game that I will necessarily pull out on my own.  But with the right group I will enthusiastically play.  The good points are the way the game builds and progressively gets harder, and the whole planning and adapting.  The big downside is that it is a little bit dry and a little on the long side which makes it less fun with people who are not enthusiastic about it.  (but with people who really enjoy the game it is a fantastic time)

This game is good in family mode (without occupations or minor improvements as suggested by rulebook for first play), but is even better when you make those additions. The occupations and minor improvements you are dealt will alter your strategy a bit each game, offering plenty of replay-ability.

Drastically improved with Farmers of the Moor. The action cards and home heating requirement help offset the strength of Family Growth and new major improvements provide more options and depth. Starting with forests and moors rather than empty farmland makes for tougher decisions about how to fill up your board. Tons of unique minor improvements and occupations offer endless replayability once you remove all the broken and/or useless ones.

Doesn't feel like a game. Scripted and boring. Visually not very appealing to me aside from some fences and the animals you keep. I don't get the hype. There is no fun, interaction with other players or variety in things to do. You "must" do stuff all the time that i don't want to do and doesn't feel i can make my own plan or strategy.

I will try it again for sure, maybe you just need to play more to get it. Will re-rate later.

This has achieved classic status. I enjoy the game a lot. From what I hear and read a big part of getting the most out of this one is to become familiar with the cards and always use the card draft mechanic at the start of the game. You can then hopefully collect cards that combo well and inform your overall strategy. I haven't played this often enough to do that well (in fact have never yet played with the card drafting at the start - but would like to)

A decent worker placement game with some serious shortcomings. 
The Good:
Theme
Cardplay
Theme
Decent selection of choices that diversify as the game plays on

However, the main negative of this game comes from the diversity of play and the frustration of worker amount. You can only get a realistic max of 5 workers and if you play with more than 3 it becomes nearly impossible to do this. The game also demands that you accomplish every milestone rather than focus your efforts on certain goals. This is somewhat alleviated by the ability to use cards to focus your strategy but for me the game becomes stale very fast and works infinitely better as an app than a game given the amount of pieces. Just not worth my time as a game. I'd give the app a 5

Magnífico juego que mezcla la colocación de trabajadores con la gestión de recursos. Fue un regalo de cumpleaños.
Admite de 1 a 5 jugadores. Lo he probado en todas sus versiones.
Jugando en solitario consiste en ir superando unas puntuaciones predeterminadas. No está nada mal, pero en cuanto captas la esencia puede ser un poco sencillo.
En el resto de variantes prefiero jugar a 4 o a 5, a pesar de que en esta última modalidad no he podido jugar muchas partidas.
Creo que se queda un poco cojo tanto a 2 como a 3 jugadores. A pesar de ello sigue siendo un gran juego.

Having only played this twice (or thrice?) I can't say much about it, but I do like it. I really like how there is always more to do than you can possibly do, and how it takes so freaking long to get anything out of your fields...  Plow, Collect Vegetables/plants, Plant, Harvest.

I don't like the luck introduced by cards. I like luck in most games, but in this game it feels totally out of place.

a golden moment in gaming.  a perfect evolution of the action area placement game ... ala Caylus, Pillars and Stone Age.  terrific game.  now played several times. it is a lot to digest.  there's so many things to do, and ways to win the game, that i think it'll take a few plays before "getting".  i like the action system, and the theme is pretty good, although i kind of agree with one of my fellow players, that some of the victory point conditions, seem kind of "gamey" -- building fences to wall in unused plots for one example.

Great game, a classic for a reason.  It took my wife a few more games to get into it than me, but all around a great game that, thanks to the many cards, will continue to hold great replayability.  The more I play it, the deeper I realize it is and the more I want to keep coming back to it.

I can see why this game holds appeal.  There are a lot of decisions to be made in order to make your farm run well.  I recommend accessorizing somewhat as it does increase the "theme" of the game.

While I do like this game, I don't seem to play it very well.

The quintessential worker placement game?  Maybe.  Definitely willing to play this, when others are, but I can understand opting to instead play *so* many other games, instead.

It's not so much that this game plays "for" you (it doesn't) it can certainly *feel* that way.  If I could get more plays in, with people more into it, my rating would probably be higher but, truth be told, I think my groups are simply more into the newer (arguably more-evolved) worker placements--and that's fine with me.

This game has a steep learning curve. Have patience and try to play one or two games with the rules in hand. Or better yet, have a experienced friend to guide you along. 

Once you get the basic rules in your head, this game is bags of fun and very replayable. The replayability part comes from the different (occupation and minor improvement) cards you draw at the beginning of the game. These will help determine your strategy for the game.

My Significant Other and I have invited lots of friends over to play Agricola and not one of them have found it boring! Several of them have even gone on to purchase a copy of the game.

Replaced in my collection by Caverna. We had some good fun with this game but I was never really happy with the effect the cards could have on the game. Sometimes one player would get handed a solid strategy while another would get a total lack of synergy. In retrospect I would have liked to have played with card drafting at the beginning.

Currently our 'new' game.  After less a 1/2 dozen or so plays, I'm still discoverying everything I want to do.  And it's always more than I have time for.  The game lasts awhile, but by rounds 8 or 9 it seems like it's almost over and I still have about 10 things I need to do.  Serious game, so takes some convincing to get my teens to sit down for it.

In my heart of heart I sill prefer Puerto Rico, but that may be because I played it first. What can you say in such a small space about a classic? Maybe a bit TOO many options (I've had it for a year and I STILL stuck to the card-less "family" variant") but it's nice to get a game that actually continues to provide so much play-value even with just the base set.

An awful rulebook though.

Worker placement type game where there is always more actions that need to be done than there is selections you can make. Uses a farming theme that fits the game play very well. Each space has an obvious use and resources build up over time - making spaces more valuable.

This was a completely lukewarm experience for me. Nothing great here, nothing truly new, innovative or never-seen-before, but nothing (quite yet) overused. Suffers from Option Blur -- too many directions you can move in, and too many things that need to be accomplished by the end of the game. So even on turn one, you already need a pretty clear plan on how you're going to pursue things. Evaluating the different actions is extremely difficult - because you have no clear-cut context for what is inherently more important or valuable than something else. Competition and Screw Factor feels completely arbitrary. Early on a decision can completely derail another person. There's not necessarily any game context for it. No real reason, just arbitrary shit-disturbing. Felt like a hodge podge of things I've already seen in Caylus, Stone Age and even Age of Steam. I suppose I'd play again, but there are a LOT of other games I'd prefer to play first. I simply do not "see" what the rabid fans of this game see.

This game is great once you've mastered the basics of the family game, tried a couple of regular games with the E-deck, and finally understand how to use the cards to your advantage. The learning curve is high, but it's well worth the effort. I am raising the rating to an 8, as I don't think I will turn down any more offers to play this - unless its up against a game I like even better of course. ;)

The game is superb. Possibilities are endless with the cards but the end take of the game tends to be repetitive at the end. But then again, which game isn't? After a while, you'll get the hang of "Settler-quarry"-esque as an opening and "harbor-wharf" closure combo.

i can't push Agricola to a 9 rating as i still have doubts in its playability over long period of time. This game is still depending on my mood to play. 

All in all it is a good game to have for a collection.

My love to Agricola has faded away. I'd rather play Le Havre - it's design is much cleaner than Agricola or even Loyang when I want to play something with my wife. There're too many things in this game - feeding, building, breeding, helpers etc. I like more cleaner desings - it's still a good game but I think there're much better games in that category.

This game has a lot of accounting bits, and most moves feel like "if only my brain could do a deep search, there is an optimal move, but since I want to play before next year I am just going to do what seems pretty good, not optimal".  This feeling of always making non optimal moves made it a bit disappointing.  I prefer to make non optimal moves that could be optimal given the right future play of luck/unknown information.

Great game, but perhaps not as elegant as I'd like (complex and interesting outcomes are mostly the result of complex and numerous inputs). 

Occupations and improvements are very powerful. Random card draw at beginning is ruinous--open face card drafting improves this. Scoring is detached from theme. 

Still, some of its strong suits and difficult choices can't be ignored. I love the theme.

Rating will probably increase after i switch to the normal version.

This game is a serious brainburner, but the scoring is not obvious, the cards for players break symmetry too much and the result is that game lacks rivalry for me, but i see it is a good game.

The “King of Worker Placement Games” according to one review and certainly agree.  Tough decisions, the feelign that you're really building something and many ways to score points.  This is one I will always want to play.  The one gripe I might agree with is that you are building the same farm over and over... but the journey is the reward in Agricola.

I got my copy from Tanga along with the Animeeples, Vegimeeples and Farm-Meeples. Saved me from learning how to use Fimo... ;)

This is probably the best Euro I have ever played.  There are a ton of options, its very tense, and there are many paths to victory.

Another really important aspect for me, is that the theme does not feel pasted on at all.  I really feel like I am a farmer barely scraping by, just trying to support my family through the next harvest.

I don't really own anything like it so it feels completely fresh to me.  

Sometimes sessions can be a little too intense, thus we don't pull this one out very often.

My wife and I bought this game, drawn in by the agriculture theme. We played through it about 5 or 6 times without using the career cards or the minor improvements, wanting to first become comfortable with the basic game mechanics. At the end of the 6th play, we were worried we were going to be bored with the game.

Then we added in the career cards and minor improvements, and suddenly the strategic possibilities exploded. The cards really increase the game's replay value as you will likely never get the same set of cards from game to game to game.

I also really appreciate the way the game board adapts to the number of players. This makes a fantastic 2 player game (which is the main reason I bought it), but also works really well with more.

I definitely recommend it.

After seeing all the 10 ratings here on BGG and the prizes this game has won, I wonder if I really played the same game. This is a monster. It's huge and there's a lot to take in on a first play. I must say I'm never a big fan of these kind of cube pushers, or resource optimization games or worker placement games, or whatever you call them. Caylus did nothing for me either and I can only stomach Cathedral and Stone Age because they are so well designed and streamlined. Streamlined is not a word that is applicable to Agricola. There's a ton of resources and then a ton of extra powers too. It's just not a lot of fun. I do stuff and I don't care. If I play a two hour+ game I want to conquer the world not plant a friggin' vegetable.

RATING: 9.5
I'm happy to report that Agricola is just as good as most people have claimed it to be.  Even though the game was low on interaction (since you're just building and trying to diversify your own farm, only the resources and actions are being competed with), I didn't mind it because I was too busy doing my own thing.  The 4-player session I participated went by really fast, no one took an extraordinarily long time to make their decisions, and by the time when I've finally got a workable engine going, it was already next to the last round!  The game will sneak by you if you don't pay attention and plan carefully ahead.  In retrospect I took a handful of choices that could've been better spent elsewhere.

To be sure there is a randomness factor in the kind of cards you are dealt, and while it would be great to get occupations and improvements that have synergy with each other, I think half of the fun is to do the best with the hand you are given.  Agricola did not seem particularly heavy to me, and should have a wide appeal.

Update #1: This is the second time I've witnessed people running out of useful options to do in the very last round.  So they could have taken actions that others still needed.  While that is a perfectly valid strategy, but it seems like against the spirit of the game, since defensive plays isn't really what Agricola is about.

Update #2: I commented in a thread recently that I really hate the ambiguity in the sequence of how actions and card effects are resolved.  Maybe it's the old MTG in me that's resurfacing, but when you have a game that have so many cards interacting with each other, it is all the more important to have a clear set of guidelines to determine the causes and effects so you don't end up with strange and conflicting interpretations.  Agricola is a big offender of that.  Luckily with the sheer number of the unique cards available, this problem doesn't always come up.  Still, the designer should have been aware of this and addressed it.

Many actions can be chosen, and you can’t make a wrong decision. Almost everything you do, will make you gain points at the end of the game. What is the right strategy? Go for the vegies or go for your live-stock? Or upgrade your rooms, or…. Or… As said, lots of possibilities and their is almost nothing what is wrong. And that’s what makes this a fun game. You just think out a strategy for yourself, and you play for yourself.

And that’s the point, what I dislike about this game. Their is almost zero interaction between the playes. A game like Le Havre is balanced better that way. Conclusion of this one. This is a nice game, maybe ideal for families and/or non-gamers. On our shelves, it’s placed below Le Havre, and I would pick Le Havre before Agricola to play.

But on the other side. We put all of the tokens in a plain-box. We could set-up a game within 5 minutes, and I think it really has a playing time of 25-30 minutes when you’re playing with just 2. This could be an ideal game to play between soup and potatoes.

The best thing about this game is its theme. Seriously. If this game wasn't about a farm and didn't contain any animals in it, it wouldn't be so popular for sure.

I play it from time to time, but to be honest - people who know how to play it prefer other titles and people who doesn't - don't want to play it because of decision complexity.

I like this game, although the amount of available actions is sometimes overwhelming. The main downside is that the game ends when you are finally getting your farm together, leaving a sense of incompleteness.

I have now played the game a number of times and with each play I like the game more and more.  I have lost horribly and barely eked out wins.  It stands the test of constant replay and I enjoy putting my cards to their best use.  I also like that major improvements give you victory points for the end of the game.  Careful attention to details is what usually wins the game.  I especially like the end round when maximizing your points can sometimes give you a shot at winning a close game.

Oh, yeah.  This is the good stuff.  The "family game" feels elegant, but the competition for same resources is rough. In the more advanced games, the cards you get not only help each player specialize in something slightly different, they also serve as a marvelous distraction if you poorly judge their value for your particular situation.  They provide CCG-style boosting and combos, so it can be [too] exciting to try them out.  Marvelous game!

I broke down and got it. I even took the next step and got the little animal, resources, and farmer bits from Mayday games.

I played 4 2-player games and a couple of solo games in the first week. There is so much to love and hate about this game at the same time.

Hate: the original pieces, the 9 or so double-sided boards that are all the same color, the rules that read like they were translated with one of those really bad online translators.

Love: The game is so much fun though once you get going. The cute theme has helped me suck in players that would never play any other game of comparable weight. The nail-biting tension.
I'm ready for 7,000 expansions...

I suck at it.  But I love it.  Still, sometimes I think that its complicatedness isn't warranted.  (I don't care that the rules are involved.  I care that they are more involved than they need to be for the level of fun delivered.)

Edit:  From 8 to 9.  I take back what I said about its complexity; it does need to be there.

Great for gamers.  Very little random chance.  You're an 18th century farmer... how much better can it get???  Only complaint is the effectiveness and practicality of some occupation cards.

Update:  Draft the cards - solves all the problems in this game.  Back up to a 9 rating for me.

2012 Update:  I officially jumped off the Puerto Rico bandwagon and back into the Agricola one.  Agricola up to a 9.5, Puerto Rico down to a 9!

Late 2012 Update:  This is the best thing to ever come out of Germany.  Aside from Chess and Go (which don't really count), a better game has never been created.

I played the Family Version (without minor improvements and occupations), and the game was DEEP. There are so many aspects, things to think about, and planning that needs to be done. A great game, but I need a few more plays to come to grips with it.

RATING: 7.8
Tried it yesterday, and while it proved to be a really massively well thought-out design, it was partly a frustrating experience. Yes, repeated plays could improve this, but the constant feeling of either "I don't have enough turns/resources/workers to do what I want" or "I don't know what I should do first/second/third" was kinda exhausting.
Also the random distribution of occupations and small improvements feels like a gamebreaker, even though it actually isn't (I could win if I hadn't made a mistake on the last turn, and I was the one with less cards played from the starting hand).

It is indeed a good game, but it is really about doing most stuff and not about doing exactly "your stuff". It is also a tad less confrontational than what I like in a game, and fairly long to setup.

All in all, Caylus still owns the top spot in my eurogames and WP list.

Game forces you not to specialize, but the theme is not superfluous. Agricola would be good if it included moonshine, kidnapping, and blood-feuds. At least it has bacon.

Still my personal favourite.  The two-tiered resource system and the tension between growth and food, along with the card strategy (including drafting) make this game very deep.

Tusia daje jej 10/10 :) . Gra o rozwoju średniowiecznego gospodarstwa - dysponuj swoją rodziną tak, aby gospodarstwo rozwinęło się jak najlepiej. Dość skomplikowana, ale z względnie intuicyjnymi akcjami (zboże można zjeść, zasiać lub upiec chleb, zwierzęta można rozmnażać lub przerobić na kotlety...).

I abhor this game, but I like Ora et Labora.  Agricola is just the most boring game I've ever played, and that includes things like Chutes and Ladders.  Probably this has something to do with the theme, but not entirely.  The gameplay is thoroughly dull as well.

It should be noted that in a long history of gaming, this is the only game I ever remember flat rage-quitting on in the middle of a game.  I still feel bad about doing it.  I also feel quitting was worth it because I didn't have to play this crap anymore.

Don't let the theme scare you off. Agricola is an excellent game and once you start using the more complicated card sets it gains a decent amount of depth and variation between plays.

RATING: 10
After 5+ Plays: This one grew on me after several plays, and is now one of my very favorite games.  The variable startup offered by the cards is truly amazing.  I was, like many people, worried that this would introduce too much luck for a game of this length, but my fears were unfounded.  With 14 cards, there are very few deals that produce truly awful hands.  

After 20+ plays: I've slowed down playing this after burning out on it a bit.  Still, this has a solid spot among my favorite games.  I have begun to avoid 5-player though, partially because of the loss of control, but more because it just starts to take too long, especially if one or two players are playing slowly.

What-the-what now? 6.5? Lower than a lot of people, but something just doesn't scratch the itch for me. I think that as a worker placement game it just seems a bit more vanilla now than it does when it came out. Plus, insert commentary about the randomness of starting hands being too powerful in determining winners.

  I bought Agricola for two reasons : it is a high praised game here on BGG and it was on sale. I doubted I would like it because I'm not too fond of worker placement games, especially the ones that take more than 75 minutes to play. It also looked complicated (a gamers game). Well, I didn't have much expectations with Agricola (though I really like some other Uwe Rosenberg's games like Mamma Mia and Bohnanza).

  Well, I'm glad I bought it because this game is a gem! Most worker placement games I know are plain, boring and themeless (read Caylus) : collect 2 blue cubes here, trade them for 1 red cube, blabla... Not in Agricola. The mechanics fit nicely with the theme and a 2-hour game is entertaining through the end. Win or lose, there's really a sense of accomplishment at the end of the game. 

  I only played the family version so far (4 times), so I still have a lot of things to discover in Agricola.

A big 10 for me!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Only one solo play so far but this one was quite impressing. It's unbelievable how many different variants the cards offer. Will update my rating after more games!
Update after 7  plays: this game really rocks. Regardless of solo or multiplayer play - it's really one of the best out there.
Only drawback is the updating and managing of resources, but that's what you have with all complex games like Caylus, Roads & Boats... The diversity of this is incredible: I still haven't even tried all different decks.
Oh and btw: this game can feel almost a bit like role-playing when you first see your cards and try to figure out what your family members should learn first.
Man, this game really rocks...

Cool theme of building your own farm. Nice bits with wooden sheeps, pigs and cows.
A significant property of the game is that only a diverse strategy scores points. When you want to specialize you'll get negative points. This results in everyone doing basically the same. There's one factor though that gives variety and that are the many cards. 
Long waiting time between turns, so needs to be played with a small group. Feeding the family pawns is a little bit of a chore gameplay wise. 
Positive things is the theme of building up a farm. It's a good competitive euro to see who gets the most done with the cards he gets.

I really like this game's mechanics and style. It's visually appealing to see your farm grow out, and the worker placement is great. This game is usually very intense, and stressful, but super enjoyable. I don't enjoy everything quite as much as say Keyflower, mostly because I feel like there's some artificial stress in the game that doesn't need to be there. Great when it's on the table, however, and I won't say no to it if suggested.

Extremely difficult to get into. Tight, calculated survival that makes it difficult to do something FUN, as opposed to something TO SURVIVE. If you plan to own this, also plan to either play with serious eurogamers or a set group. Teaching this game to new players is crushing.

There's not doubt there's a lot of interesting stuff in there, and it's pretty well designed. It's kinda fun to build up your little property. However, despite the variability in card draw, there doesn't seem to be that much actual variety in the strategy, and it's long and kind of slow. Just didn't feel very satisfying.

Excellent example of a worker placement style game. Fairly easy to learn. Play time is at least a couple of hours, even with just two players. Players must build up their farm using their family members to take a variety of actions, the goal being to build the most well-rounded farm. Lot of variation due to different board layouts and wide selection of extra cards to play.

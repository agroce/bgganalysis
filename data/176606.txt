• Art is playful and well done
• Tons of pieces with high quality components and custom dice (including metal coins)
• Comes with multiple scenarios

• Relies immensely on luck
• Some of the ship upgrades are unbalanced (others are incredibly OP)

Dice proximity/movement title with a good amount of theme.  Gorgeous art, but some of the card text and icons are squint-worthy.  Length may be a little long and it's a little complicated for a dice-thrower.  It's entertaining, but almost more work than fun in some ways.

Gyönyörűen kivitelezett játék, A grafika bámulatos. A hangulat kiváló. Ötletes elemek vannak benne. Sok fázisból áll a játék, melyeket szigorúan be kell tartani. A küldetés lapok sokasága miatt sokszor újrajátszható. Két gondom volt csak vele. Az egyik a tengeri csata kivitelezése. Ott bizony hatalmas a szerencsefaktor, amivel még nem is lenne akkora gond, de a kiértékelésével igen. Először is a dobozban kell dobni, ami érhető, hogy ne menyjen szanaszét a kockahad, de adtak hozzá egy lépték vonalzót, mely véletlenül sem használható jól a dobozban. Inkább kockázták volna fel léptékkel a tengert halványan és akkor leszámolható lettek volna a távolságok. A másik gondom talán a kincs szerzéssel volt, melynél értem, hogy kompenzálják a szerencsefaktor, de jóformán minden csatában 1-2 kincs különbséggel mindenki nyert. Valahol azért mégis úgy érzem, hogy kiegyensúlyozott volt a játék kivitelezése, mert éreztem, hogy az összetettséget nehéz volt kiegyensúlyozni a játék folyamán. Nekem egy kicsit feszegeti a játék az euro játékok határait.

Underneath  what looks like a kids game is an overly complex dice roller.  Many special abilities and unintuitive rules make this slow to learn.  It's not hard to learn, it's just hard to learn to play it fast enough to make it fun. I would like to play it again sometime

Played once so far.
There's some fun , but the game's flawed by some aspects:
Bad rulebook, not clear and confusing.
Too much luck involved
Too much work to be a light game (measurements, upgrades, etc.)
Too long.

The general impression is the game's a game of chance and the  most of the rules are there to lessen the effect of the luck.

Funny for a couple of plays.

Ignacy's new one.

Heavily luck driven dice fest which is great fun, chuck a handful of dice in the box lid and find out what happens.

Once chucked in the box the face and position of the dice are key to gaining resources and sinking ships which in turn gain you the upgrades and gold to purchase victory points. 

Five rounds of pure fun where all your careful planning can be four naught with a bad roll of the dice, but hey a turn is only 15 minutes so you are back in the game and getting your revenge asap

The sheer over-production of this game simply warms you to its theme (and publisher). A simple and light hearted pirate game is transformed with a brilliant central 'battle' mechanic which uses the game box lid as the ocean and you throwing dice into it as a birds-eye view of naval combat; dice faces giving strength and ship upgrades offering greater maneuverability within this snow globe (snow box?) of pure and supreme randomisation. A tome for board game ingenuity which fortunately, is also rather fun too.

I like how whimsical the game looks & feels.

Decisions aren't exactly hard, though each dice drop feels exciting & sometimes you do have to crunch a little on how best to use your ship's upgrades. 

The best part of the game for me is the building aspect. Each special tile offered feels strong, and the fact that you're actually BUILDING IT ONTO YOUR SHIP provide a clear sense of improvement. 

It's highly tactical & luck based, but all these just adds up to a game that encourages you to enjoy the journey & not the destination.

Easily one of the most unique games I've ever played. The rule book is terrible, which I think makes the game a bit clunkier than it needs to be but it was still a lot of fun once we grasped it. It could do with one less round. But the components for building a pirate ship were fun enough for a game itself. And the tricky little dice game (which people seemed to want to play as like a fighting/sinking game but to me my winning strategy of run away and cause as many of my opponents ships to be sunk before I start sinking worked better) was breezy enough and gave you a sense of accomplishment that I'd play it on its own.

I understand why this game gets the hate that it does. It is SUPER long for a luck-based game. However I do really like this game it has very cool mechanics, I love the pirate theme and it comes through strong, the art work is great and the coins in the game are made of metal! There are items in the game help mitigate the amount of luck in the game, and there is still a fair bit of the user controlling their fate with their strategy. However like I said the game does run long. 

Also in the rule book there is a QR code you can scan to give you a visual demonstration of rules and game play. Use it. The rule book in my opinion was a bit of a dumpster fire.

Dice pirate game. It's fun, but the mechanic doesn't seem to be well oiled. Not sure why but the games doesn't flow as well as I'd like. Core mechanics are interesting with the dices being boats, some pirates, some marchants. It's scenario based which I like a lot and you can upgrade your ship but sometimes, these upgrades feels like an afterthoughts.

Despite high hopes, I was kind of lukewarm on this. The components are great, but it feels a like it has fewer strategic choices than most gateways, while also being a bit more complex. I won, but I'm not entirely sure that I earned it; seems like maybe I just happened to roll better dice or draw better cards than the other players. You really shouldn't have to reference the rules so much in a game so light.

Read all the negative reviews and watched all the bad press. Was totally convinced I was going to hate it but when an opportunity to buy it for 20 came up I decided why not. Needless to say, loved it. A great smorgasbord of a ton of different mechanics that work perfectly. Reminds me a bit of galaxy trucker in it's randomness but honestly you have much more opportunities to mitigate that luck. Also the game doesn't beat you down as hard. Run don't walk to purchase a copy as I think it might make a come back eventually and it will probably only have one print run.

Bitewniak, zamiast figurek kości. Gra dla dzieci ale zasady i rozgrywka nie dla dzieci, dla dorosłych też nie. Fajna się robi jak się samemu uprości zasady tylko wtedy to jest już bardziej zabawa w piratów a nie gra. Może nie trzeba by upraszczać gdyby zasady napisane były dla normalnych ludzi a nie dla tych co je znają. Jedna z najmniej intuicyjnie napisanych instrukcji ze wszystkich tutaj. Bardzo ładne wykonanie, wysoka jakość komponentów i orginalny pomysł (kupiony). Pomysłodawcy nie mogli się dogadać i zrezygnowali z wydawania w Portalu (ciekawe dla czego? ;)) Ich wersja całkiem inna, tylko rzucanie kostkami do pudła jest podobne, niedługo wyjdzie po polsku u innego wydawcy.

It has quickly become a favorite despite (or because of) the randomness, it's just plain fun to play, even when you are losing horribly. It gives the feeling of being a pirate and fighting other players with a fairly fast resolution system that still offers room to plan and make decisions during the game.

Now have the expansion, Angry Ocean. This one will have a hard time getting to the table.  It just doesn't fit anywhere. I do like it, but it's fiddly with the scoring and the rules, hard to explain, and has too much random dice rolling for Euro gamers who like fiddly complicated rules.  Families will find it too complicated, I fear.

It's neat to play in the box, but actually hard to see the dice for short people (me) so I may switch to a dice box instead.

I want to play it again, but my game group did not enjoy it.  There is also the problem with purchasing items for gold to earn victory points -- no way to mitigate that it goes in turn order and increases in price.  It became obvious without using sailors (and maybe not even then) there was no way to stop a runaway leader.

RATING: 5
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This game is very nicely produced and has beautiful metal coins. I enjoyed the game play but be aware that this is a very chaotic and quite a bit of luck of the die roll/card draw comes into play. This is much more of a whimsical good time/experience game where you don't take the game too seriously. Initially, the rule set felt overwhelmingly complex for what is a chaotic, if fun, time with the 10 step quest phase - just feels overcooked a bit. However, after a couple times through it becomes pretty straightforward. The NPC and player activation phases can be confusing to as the battle phase follows - but basically the NPC ships may have a free action(s) to move away/sink your ships before you battle/take actions and then you also have a chance to do the same. The battle then occurs with those ships remaining after all activations. There are a large number of unique items and sailors that feel overpowered but are more annoying than overpowered. 

All in all, after just having played the introductory quest, I found it enjoyable if chaotic and random. If you want a deep, strategic game, this is not it.

There's a lot of goofy, random fun to be had here -- it's a dice game and it makes no apologies for that, which I always like. But it's almost not goofy and random enough? After you drop the dice into the box there's this bit with measuring and distance and stuff that suddenly pops up and feels a little weird. It's like when FFG added that out-of-place card combat into its DungeonQuest reprint. Maybe I just wasn't expecting it. 

Second play pretty much confirmed impressions. I'm just not liking this one. It's loopy and wild and then comes the actual "rattle battle", at which point it becomes a tedious game of measurement and positioning that soaks up the little momentum the rest of the game builds. Too goofy for the people who will like the combat, which will turn off the people who like the goofy. A disappointment.

boiled down Merchants and Marauders 60-90mins vs 3hrs. Drops the play time by making everyone do their port action all at once. 
The wife loves it, it can be a little "take that", but still very tactical and strategic. Building up your ship and Crew is a blast.

The sort of game where I'm more interested in having an awesome ship (engine) than winning

Not so great on 5 player, feels like there should be more enemy ships to go round

I was asking Oleg and Oleksandr for changes, but they were pulling project in a different direction. I wanted upgrades, they wanted role selection. I wanted special powers, they wanted port with prices and set collection of goods. 

This year there will be two pirate games that uses 3d Dice Battle System released. Different games that were born on one common fundament invented by Oleksandr Nevskiy and Oleg Sidorenko. There is mine game called Rattle, Battle, Grab the Loot and there is Pirates of 7th Seas. Both use tossing dice into box. And both take this base idea in a very different direction and game play.

Try them if you have a chance. It's a pure and crazy fun packed into cardboard box.

RATING: 8
Super random, super chaotic, super visually appealing but most importantly - SUPER FUN.  Yes you will need to take a few minutes to learn how to play (just do the first couple intro scenarios) but after that the game plays quite quickly.  I don't know why people want this to be only a 20 minute experience.  Without the decisions and upgrades this game would just be rolling dice in a box (ie: not interesting).  Recommended for people who love dice, pirates or great components.  Definitely a beer and pretzels game.

Underrated game. Very nice components.

A mix of throwing dice, customizing your ships, wargaming (measuring fire and movement with a ruler). One player leading through the entire game session may loose his leadership in the last rounds and that's great !

Vague rulebook, chaotic gameplay, turn order issues. Most of the time I could do absolutely nothing. Frankly, I've only played the introductory scenario, but it didn't motivate me to play it again.

Finally a game, that is able to take itself not too seriously. A mix of tableu building, miniature skirmish, dexterity game and resource management. Horribly underappreciated - seems to subtle and refined for a common crowd.

Kids like this. This is a very engrossing pirate game. The mechanics for sea battles could be a little clunky but just keep it simple and don't let the game slow down too much. Kids love sailing the seas and stealing loot. The best part is building a huge kick ass pirate ship with all the loot you collect. Great game, massively underated.

Great production value. Still not sure if there is a great game behind the confusing rulebook. Seemed a bit meh. Would be sad to know that have all that great artwork is wasted on a mediocre design.

Played this family game a round at SPIEL '15. Nice pirate theme but I wasn't hooked by gameplay. Not every Trzewiczek game is a bull's eye. At least for me.

Definitely an odd game, but FUN.  Very fun as a two player once you get through the semi-convoluted rules.  But honestly, once you figure them out, the game flows very well.  Some complain that it is too random, and maybe it is at higher play counts, but I found at two player that the upgrades you add to your ship generally give you interesting things to do on your turn.  I still have fun even if I performed terribly.  

I don't know, it's not an earth shattering game by any means, but I am having fun with it, it's gorgeous, and it's different.  6.75, glad I have it in my collection for the time being!

What a peculiar game. It wants to be whimsical and just have fun, but then it's held back by a bevy of neuroses. The result is surprisingly great for a light night of dice-chucking.

Fun dice game in the tradition of Galaxy Trucker.  I do wonder if the scenarios are a little long, though.  Maybe 1 less quest next time.

Only a couple of plays in but seems alright.  I like the ship building, and the combat system is interesting but can bog down as ships get more complex later in the adventures.  Games can get long and somewhat stale, could be from our group and time of day.

We played the introductory game.  Honestly, it's unique, but I'm not sure there is much game here.

I'd try it again, but I doubt the rating would go up.  It is more likely to go down.

Dice proximity pirate game throwing handfuls of dice into the game box lid that serves as the central ocean.   Players successively resolve ship battles based on the proximity of player dice with the neutral merchant or navy dice. Players have upgradeable pirate ships to add components like crew, cargo holds, cannons or sails.  Clever use of the playing cards measuring distance with card width (cannons) or length (sails) to determine cannon fire distance or closing to board. Collect the merchant dice and battle opponents to complete successively more challenging card goals of dice collection combinations. Stow plunder tokens for points and spend doubloons to buy upgrades and repair ships. Endearing art with a variety of game components that add to the thematic experience.  But you have to play knowing it is heavily random with quite a few specific turn order rules to learn. Playing and resolving dice proximity in the game lid is creative but awkward.

Liek the game, but don't play too often due to the chance element but every now and again it is a good game to pickup as enjoy the upgrading of the ship.

Bought at Essen 2015, after compelling demo at Portal booth. The game looks gorgeous and the upgradeable pirate ships are a lot of fun. 

Played once with 2 players (intro scenario). The intro scenario is quite good at presenting the rules. Enjoyed the game more than I thought I would. It's a light game however. The dice-throw/ship battle mechanism is quite fun, and of course it is also quite random. 

It did feel like I could battle the randomness with smart upgrades to my ship. I loved the ship upgrading part quite a bit, I wasn't so keen on winning (though I did by 1 point) but on getting loot to upgrade my ship. 

Despite the light-weight of the game it is probably not a game you would want to play with non-gamers. The battle mechanism is too intricate for that. In the battle you have to plan how to use your upgrades, sails and cannons and look ahead to further adventures before you get back to port. 

I recommend this for gamers who want some light-hearted pirate fun between more serious games. 

Has a bit of setup (many parts), but once you know the rules a game should be about 1 hour. 

PS: however after 1st play I have quite the list of rules questions.

Érdekes volt. Nagyon szép, jó minőségű, sok komponenst tartalmazó kalózos-harcolós-upgrade-elős dobókockás mindenféle. Talán ez a mindenféle lehet a baj, de játszanék még vele, h tisztuljon a kép, addig nem mérvadó a pontozás.

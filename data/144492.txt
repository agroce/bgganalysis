RATING: 3
A game plagued by a couple of major flaws. The first one is that the game easily stalls completely if players manage to rid themselves of money without contracts ready for delivery. Then you basically just cannot do anything. This is because there is no steady income that would keep the game going. Players are kind of assumed to play in a predetermined manner in order to not to break the game.

The second flaw is that the game is not progressing even if players have money. Usually there are only a couple of interesting cards on the table but since the first player has the power to keep them unavailable to everyone, everybody just keeps passing and nothing happens on most rounds. 

On those rare occasions when something actually happens, you just use money to buy resources, pick up orders and fulfill them with the resources to get more money which you use to buy victory points. So nothing special here.

At it's heart Packet Row has one neat mechanism; the harbour master picks a location and other players may choose cards from that location ahead of him.  If the harbour master then takes a card, the round ends and anybody who didn't take a card is left empty handed.  Sometimes as harbour master you'll want to lead your opponents around the locations, hoping that they'll drop out, leaving you with the location and card that you want.  Other times you'll gamble that you can pick up something useful without that merry dance and leave others with nothing.  That's the game - the rest is just set collection.  What might have been palatable as a quick filler goes on rather too long. That process of settling for something while the cards you really need whizz by can make progress slow and  the game seem longer.

Just as the game feels like something small that has been over-inflated, so the same can be said of a box that is at least twice as big as snecessary.  Production quality is decent, the artwork is forgettable, though the iconography is clear and easily understood.  The rules are clear enough.

RATING: 5
A light card game with simple rules that offers interesting choices. The central mechanic works very well and feels fresh. The theme is kinda boring. Sell goods to gain money in order to buy building for VP. I dont think that the game has enough replayability in the long run. The mechanics are good but will not hold up due to the repetitive gameplay.

RATING: 5
Strip the game of the harbor master mechanic, there doesn't seem to be much here. But with that mechanic, the game evolves into something that is much more interesting and engaging. This mechanic mandates that the harbor master picks the card drafting board. But there is a twist; the harbor master goes last and the round ends as soon as the harbor master picks a card. Thus, the game turns into this experience where you are constantly trying to predict what other players want. When you're the harbor master, you want to find ways to get the cards you need and deny your opponents a turn. And when you're not the harbor master, a push-your-luck tension emerges as you try to predict whether the harbor master will end the round or move to another board. 

Overall, the entire mechanic is refreshing and interesting. That being said, there are two things that bother me. 
1) The game has a fair amount of randomness; because you need 3 cards, which are specific to each other, to complete a contract... you may find yourself in a situation where you never have the opportunity to buy a specific card. That being said, there are numerous cards that change the value of other cards, which reduces the randomness at the expensive of a turn. 
2) The game feels like it ends too quickly. Perhaps this is a hallmark of a good game and a bit of a blessing considering the randomness... but most of the game feels like positioning yourself for selling a few contracts.

That being said, I enjoy this game and find predicting other players' choices interesting and slightly brain-burning. Furthermore, the gameplay is fluid, elegant, and easy to teach. There is something charming about this design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Tight design with a simple elegance.  Straightforward, scales well, moves fast, tickles the brain, has tension as the turns move - but it only does 1 thing great.  However for me that 1 thing (the drafting mechanic) is enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A magnificent example of how very simple rules can create a tense game, full of psichology.  As an active player, you choose the area where the cards will be taken from, but you will be the last to choose the card.  The other players may take or pass... but if the active takes card, the round is over!  
Cards are mainly contracts, goods for them, and characters that help you during the game, and for sure the points to buy with the money got from contracts.
Only played in Yucata, where unfortunately it works quite slow due to the fact that there are a lot of micro-turns, and there is total information.  But the game is actually really good.
UPDATE: Played live, it works even better because you don't have all the information of your opponent's hand (unless your memory is magnificent).  Om the downside, the box is just ridiculously enormous.  They could have made it much, much, much smaller.

Preliminary rating based on one play. It plays rather quickly; so I'm taking that into consideration. There are some interesting decision in how you acquire cards based on where the Harbor Master is allocated. I felt like you didn't have sufficient control of how you are acquiring the cards you need to fulfill the contracts with and it could be randomly determined for you. I need more plays to make a final judgment. Still; it plays quick enough that it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Update: There was a lot more depth revealed in subsequent plays! An excellent super filler!

RATING: 6
I found the game to be "ok", but i think it may be a bit underrated (which is weird, since my score is a bit under the BGG avg).  The game offers something very different within a pretty short playing time.  The low end game scores are a bit weird, and for sure its easy to get completely screwed over, but after everyone knows how to play, this game could easily end in 45min.  With so many good games that came out during Essen 2013, I can see why this has gotten so little love, but this is one I am interested in getting more plays.

Underrated Game! I have played it at yucata.de and liked it a lot. I want to get a copy, moreover it's cheap right now.

It's a ver easy game with one great pseudo-auction mechanic as main rule.

Very good game with a weight similar to Pergamon or Saint Petersburg. I think that the big box doomed this game because gamers were looking for something more meaty, but I particullary love this kind of games: 

45 minutes - easy rules - hard decisions.

Got to say this one surprised me. 4 districts the first player choses the district. The second player goes than the next than the first player. If the first player take a card than the round is over. Wow tough decisions abound in this one. It's almost a Princess Bride you surely won't choose this card if he does well shoot now the round is over and I didn't get one! Great Game. May move up to get a ranking of 9

This is a good medium-light eurogame. It can be played very quickly, has an interesting base-mechanism that is highly interactive and plays very quickly.

On the bad side, there's slightly too much luck for my taste. Will you start with a player directly competing against you? Will another contract appear for the same country you just took?

A good game that definitely is better with more players. The harbor master mechanic is tricky to figure out as you have to figure out if you want to go to the place you want first or later and hope to get the cards you want. Since you have to buy both goods which will only return coins and victory points with coins it can be hard to manage money to buy the right thing that you want.

As a quick auction game it works well and I wouldn't mind trying it again some time.

New York, 1842: The docks along South Street bustle with activity. Packet ships are constantly arriving and departing. There are so many packet ships waiting along the docks that the area has become known as the "Packet Row".
In the game Packet Row, each player represents a trading company that's trying to make as much profit as possible on the trans-Atlantic trade. However, having a lot of cash is not enough to win this game. You must spend your money for the benefit of the city at the right time to gain as many victory points as possible.

RATING: N/A
Packet row is een spel van de makers van Rattus, dus kreeg direct onze attentie toen het werd aangekondigd. Bovendien zijn we fan van Michael Menzel die het artwork voor z'n rekening heeft genomen. Na het lezen van de spelregels hadden we ietwat een dubbel gevoel. We hadden enigszins verwacht dat dit een lijviger spel zou worden, maar na enig overpeinzing bleek de fout toch wel duidelijk bij ons te liggen. Ook Rattus was geen serieuze doordenken, maar gewoon een goed spel, niet te gecompliceerd, maar toch wel wat mogelijkheden ... wel dat gevoel hebben we hier alvast ook en het is een goed gevoel.

Packet row vertelt het verhaal van de af en aankomende schepen in de haven van New York in de jaren 1800. De handel bloeit op en de immigratie komt helemaal op gang. Het is aan jou als speler om de noodzakelijke dingen van boord te halen om contracten te vervullen, geld te incasseren en vooral terug te investeren in de opbouw van de stad. De speler die hiermee de meeste punten verzamelt, wint het spel.

In het spel zijn er vier locaties met bijbehorend speelbord. Hierop ligt telkens een stapel kaarten, waarvan er drie worden opengelegd in de huidige markt en twee in de toekomstige markt. Uit de vier huidige markten gaan de spelers in een speelronde kaarten kiezen, deze op handen nemen en ten gepaste tijde uitspelen indien mogelijk. Hiermee is eigenlijk het ganse speelsysteem al uitgelegd. Enkel het kiezen van de kaarten is op zich bijzonder te noemen, het heeft ietwat weg van het veilen zoals bij "Vorsten van Florence", je moet enkel niet met geld bieden en mag gewoon een kaart nemen. Concreet is er elke ronde een havenmeester (startspeler) die één van de borden kiest, daarna mogen de andere spelers in volgorde één van de kaarten van dit bord nemen. Je mag ook gewoon passen. De havenmeester heeft als laatste de kans om een kaart te nemen, indien er nog één ligt of een nieuw bord aan te duiden. Indien hij een kaart neemt, eindigt de lopende ronde. Indien hij voor een nieuw bord kiest, wordt er weer eerst de kans gegeven aan de medespelers die nog geen kaart namen. Zo gauw de havenmeester een kaart neemt, eindigt de ronde. Het kan overigens best zijn dat er een speler zonder kaart uit een ronde komt. Als je een kaart neemt, moet je soms de kosten betalen. Ze staan linksboven op de kaart. Indien je deze niet kan betalen, mag je de kaart uiteraard niet nemen. De volgende speler wordt havenmeester en begint een nieuwe ronde door de toekomstige markt naar de huidige markt te leggen en aan te vullen met één kaart en een nieuwe toekomstige markt te leggen. Dit nemen van kaarten gaat eigenlijk gewoon door tot er een aantal borden niet meer kunnen worden aangevuld (afh. aantal spelers). 

Op het einde van het spel krijgen de spelers punten voor de kaarten waarop OP's staan, 1 OP voor elke 10 dollar en punten overeenkomstig met het aantal verzamelde bankiers. (zie ook bankierkaart)

Op elke moment van het spel mogen de spelers overigens contracten vervullen. Ze moeten hiervoor het schip met de juiste locatie uitspelen, de gevraagde grondstoffen en de contractkaart. In ruil krijgen ze het geld dat op het contract staat aangegeven. 

De kaarten in het kort :
- overwinningspunten : betaal de kosten, leveren gewoon het aangegeven aantal punten op op het einde van het spel
- goederen : betaal de kosten, goederen kunnen ingeruild worden voor het vervullen van een contract
- handelaar : kost geen geld, kan je inruilen bij het vervullen van een contract om een bepaalde goederenkaart fictief te veranderen in een ander goed
- contract : kost geen geld, kan je mits het afleggen van de juiste goederen en handelsschip inruilen voor geld
- assistent : kost geen geld, kan een kaart uit een toekomstige markt nemen
- handelsschip : kost geen geld, leg je voor je neer, hiermee kan je contracten gaan vervullen
- goud : betaal de kosten, telt als een joker bij het inleveren van goederen
- kapitein : kost geen geld, kan de bestemming van een handelsschip wijzigen
- geld : kost geen geld, kan ten allen tijde afgelegd worden om het overeenkomstige geld te nemen uit de voorraad
- bankier : kost geen geld, verzamel je tot het eind van het spel, diegene die er het meeste van verzamelde krijgt per kaart een aantal OP's (afh. aantal spelers). Ook de tweede krijgt nog 1 OP per kaart die hij verzamelde (bij 4-5 spelers)

It took me most of my entire first game to finally understand the selection mechanism, it just wasn't clicking for me.  The trick is to pick an area you don't want but others do, so they don't take a card you care about.  I suck at figuring out what other people want to do.  I prefer games where I can do what I want directly, rather than indirectly as it is here.  Constantly second-guessing my opponents is not interesting to me.

Packet Row might look like your standard Euro at first sight. Get contracts, collect resources, ship goods to fulfill contracts and earn money, and spend money to buy victory points.

So far, so boring. Luckily, that's not where the game is. The trading and shipping merely provide a backdrop for a lot of tactical manoeuvering and incentive manipulation all related to how you actually acquire anything at all.

There can be no doubt that luck plays a significant role in what cards come out at which point in the game but it is short enough to simply play again right after.

First impression is very positive. Easy to learn and explain, quick to play (especially when all know the game), but it still has some nice (tactical) choices.

Love the way you've got to get into the mind of your opponent to find out in which way you can get the card you desire most.

Ein Zockerspiel, angesiedelt an den Docks von New York des 19. Jahrhunderts. Als Inhaber einer Handelsgesellschaft versucht man möglichst viel Handelsprofit mit Fahrten nach Europa zu machen. So geht es um den Erwerb von Karten aus einer Auslage aus 4 Tableaus mit jeweils 4 Karten. Dabei sammelt man 3er-Kartensets bestehend aus Schiff/Handelsauftrag/Ware, um idealerweise vom im Handel erworbenen Geld wiederum Siegpunktkarten zu kaufen. Leider ist man gegen Ende des Spiels doch sehr von Zug-getrieben und gezwungen, so dass das Endspiel eine halbschwere Spielidee ein wenig zwanghaft und wenig steuerbar erscheinen lässt.

Rating after one 4player game. This game has one (and only one) interesting mechanism: the worker placement depending on the first player / outguess your opponnents and profit of an additional action. The rest is bland and bleak. Get resources, transform them into money, transform the money into victory points. Seen a hundred times. Too repetitive. All in all a boring experience. Sad as the material is nice.

In this game the first player decides where everyone will go and then everyone gets to pick a card from the area before him/her or not pick one. The first player can then pick a card from the current area or go to another one. This simple but clever mechanism really makes the game for me. You don't only need to figure out what's most effective of you to pick up but also how other players will play. Is this person only going here to tempt everyone else to get a card or do they want to go here? This type of guess is really appealing to me. The cards are quite basic in their functionality and might get old after a few plays because there are only a few different kinds but I truly believe that the main mechanism is enough to keep this game interesting and fresh after multiple plays. A 5 player game of this game went quite quickly and was suitably intense throughout. Worth a play and probably a purchase.

RATING: 6
There’s a good idea hidden in the central mechanism of the harbor master, it only lacks in execution and would have needed more fine-tuning.  

The harbor master is a variation on the ‘split-the-cake’ mechanism. The active player chooses the area where players can claim cards, the other players select first. If a player decides to pass, he risks not getting anything if the harbor master takes a card. Players have to guess if the harbor master is trying to tempt them to claim a card as he really wants to get something from another area or hopes that they pass as he wants to get one of the available cards. So far, so interesting.

Packet Row falls short in tempo. The cards cycle through the game much too fast to give players time to plan. At best, they can hope to start 3 or 4 ships. The administration part becomes a chore being almost half of the game with three players. The luck factor of having the right cards for choice and being in the right position at that time is high. Some more fine-tuning could have made a good game out of this.

With 5, you won't get that many victory points and in the end there will be big swing what comes to those points...

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I think this game has to be a 4-5 player game only.  There are definitely some interesting mind games occurring between the harbormaster and the other opponents as far as what the HM might be trying to purchase since one can lose their opportunity to select a card if you pass hoping the HM is going to the market of your choice.  Very simple game overall in game play.  This box did not need to be nearly as large as it is.  

It is such that I would like to play again.

Come on, this game is not worth it's price. Really, the big boards to put the cards on, just take table space but don't improve the game's credibility.

In essence the gameplay is interesting (and simple), but this should have been a little card game in a small box, and sell for 9 EUR.

Now you pay for your own imagination about the chosen theme.

Nuovo gioco edito dagli autori di Rattus che però è passato molto inosservato, probabilmente a ragion veduta. Stiamo parlando di Packet Row, gioco senza elementi innovativi che, per profondità, durata e complessità si colloca tra Splendor, Borneo e Saint Petersburg. Meccaniche semplici e fluide, il gioco si lascia giocare volentieri ma non regala molte soddisfazioni. Si tratta ci collezionare contratti, materie e navi per poter spedire i prodotti nelle terre dove vengono richieste e fare soldi. Con i soldi a sua volta si potranno acquistare punti vittoria. A questo si aggiungono dei personaggi speciali che permettono alcune combo (capitano, banchiere, manovale) e abbimo una panoramica completa di questo gioco dalla longevità discutibile e soprattutto con troppa monotonia. Penso si possa passare oltre senza nessun rimpianto.

I think this is a worthy addition to the set drafting genre. It provides 4 open drafts - contracts, goods, ships, money - and each turn the first player moves from draft to draft, offering its cards up to the other players. The problem faced by the other players is that they don't know if they'll get a chance to draw from the draft they'd prefer, because if the first player takes a card from the current draft, then no more drafts will be chosen from this turn. The decision faced is not so much whether you'll get the card you want, it's one of whether you should take a lesser card now vs the risk of taking nothing for the chance that the first player doesn't take from this draft, that he'll another draft up containing a card you'd prefer. The first player meanwhile is hoping people will take cards from drafts he doesn't want to choose from, leaving him a shot at the card he does want once everyone else is out. It provides interest, trying to intuit what others might take when faced with that choice of nothing vs something vs best. Anyway, you take cards and convert combos into cash, then use that cash to buy straight VPs, or invest in more combos vs cash, trying to time it so you've done all your VP conversions before the game ends. There's not a lot of paths to explore, and it feels more like a smaller game in a too-big box (which probably helps explain a low rating) but it's decent enough to enjoy.

言語依存が低い
リーダーの役目が面白くてインタラクションは強まってるのに、ギスギス感にはあまり繋がらない。
拡大再生産要素は無く、むしろピックアンドデリバリー＋競りといったプレイ感。競りの部分が独特で、微妙にwin-winを狙うか他プレイヤーの邪魔に徹するかといったままならなさが結構ある。

軽い割に価格が高い（日本流通価格がとかじゃなく）
同じ効果で値段の異なるカードが多数だったり、ゲームへの運の取り入れ方がスマートでは無い
1プレイヤーが達成できる契約は１~２件になりやすくさして大きなリターンでは無いので、そこに関しての達成感や爽快感が少ない。
耐久性面での表面処理はいい方だが、滑りやすいのがメカニック面からはマイナス要素。

Based on one play: Simply a card collection game where you try to make sets in order to fulfill contracts n which you must deliver goods to a location. Thus you must purchase the contract, goods and destination. This is done when a player selects a location and then the other players get to either chose a card or pass, once the active players turn comes back that player can buy a card from the selected section, therefore ending the round or switch locations. The non-active players thus mys chose to buy a card or risk losing a turn by passing but possibly getting a better location activated. The game is simple but not really fun, there is mainly one choice, buy or risk not buying to get a card from another section. It gets old fairly fast.

Considering all the games I've played so far from Henrik Berg & Åse Berg, they clearly aim at medium weight games with not a lot of rules and play quickly. 
Considering that, they succeeded with Packet Row. It's not a Rattus, neither an Oregon however. It's a very opportunistic game where you just have to try to make the most about every situation. For me it's the kind of game that I wouldn't mind playing, but I doubt I will pick it out my game collection as first when choosing which game to play.

What annoyed me about this game is it's huge overproduction. The 4 boards could have clearly left out, which made this game could have come in a small box for a smaller price.

This game has one interesting mechanism (I select the board, but all others may select the cards first), but the rest is an extremely boring card collecting routine which I grew tired of after 5 minutes. No, I don't want to play that one again ...

Very dry game with no novelty besides the mechanic for choosing the markets/cards. The game is very repetitive and is based on the age-old concept of collecting resources, contracts and means to deliver the resources. Almost exactly the same has already been done dozens of times.

RATING: 4
In the first few turns this game is quite fun: Do you offer  a row with rather unuseful cards? If players take cards there, you are the only one getting a card from a better row. If no player takes a card, you might take a not so useful card, but you are the only one to take a card this round. 

In the end this game outstayed its welcome. The described mechanism soon wore off. There were too many combinations of goods and countries, such that it was quite hard to get the right combinations for shipping goods. Even though this seems to be a core mechanism, most players were only able to ship twice or three times.

This is one of those games where you need to watch what others are doing and try to guess what they are after. Players collect sets of cards: missions and products and boats to fulfill those missions. Players choose an action from four possible and the others get to execute it before the active player. The active player then either executes the action or chooses another one. The turn ends when the active player decides to execute the action even if others haven't yet executed theirs.

The clear high point of Packet Row’s gameplay is the role of the harbour master. When assuming this position, you’d want to steer your opponents to areas which may be of interest to them in hopes that they’d leave the card you want alone. But your opponents can’t be too greedy either, in case you decide to fold early and leave them high and dry.

Unfortunately, the game slides downhill from there. There’s definitely a lot of luck in the card draw, and it’s a huge problem if multiple cards you need appear in the same round. There aren’t many rounds when playing with higher player counts either, so the game focuses on making do with the little you have. Couple this with a hideously oversized box and you have an interesting concept trapped in a mediocre game. If you are in the mood for ships, contracts and Michael Menzel’s art, I’d recommend [thing=66505][/thing] instead.

RATING: 3.7
The game is centered about a card selection mechanism which presumably is meant to be the interesting part of the game, when in reality it just makes it impossible to plan ahead (or at least to also put those plans into reality). That cards that are not selected by anyone simply go away means in practice that the cards you need disappear right in front of your nose, not so much because anyone else wanted the same card -- that is a kind of competition I could understand --, but simply because you used your action already, and all unchosen cards in a selected area will go away. Which basically means that as soon as two cards that you both need are open at the same time, there is a high chance that you are screwed.

Other than that, it's a rather boring mechanism of matching contracts with goods and ships.

This is a reasonably light and simple game with some very interesting outguessing mechanics.

The play area is made up of 4 boards with different cards available for players to draft from.  There are a few special action cards but for the most part the cards available either give a small amount of money straight up, points that can be bought for money, or ships, goods, and contracts that players can fulfill for large amounts of money.  This makes the game pretty quick with some tight victory points as well.  Tight victory points is not something I'm usually a fan of but this game is light and quick enough that it's not a big deal in this case.

What does make this game very interesting is the mechanics behind this card drafting.  The starting player picks one of the four boards to go to and the other players actually get to pick cards from that board first or pass.  When it gets back around to the first player he can choose either to take a card from where he said he would go (if there is one available still) or choose a different location.  Every player who passed can choose a card from that location now before the start player again (and the start player can choose yet another location if at least one of the other players passes again).  But, if the start player does take a card from where he said he would go, players who passed go without for that turn.

This makes for some very interesting decisions and outguessing gameplay.  This makes for a lot of game in an otherwise breezy experience.  Great option when looking for a more relaxing game.

[thing=42452][/thing] has never been at the top of my list of favorites, but I think it is a solid game and I enjoy it. [thing=66251][/thing], from the same authors and publisher, on the other hand is one of the worst games (with some of the worst artwork) of any game I have ever encountered. So I was hopeful for this game, but also cautious.
The rules are very straightforward and turns are quick. We played with 2 (which the game allows) and I can tell you right now: don't do that. Ever. It's not made for 2. Whoever says it is, is lying or stupid. I can imagine the game being better with more (probably best with 4 and too tight with 5) but this game has one horrible issue: cards come along and are only available for one turn. And you're at the mercy of the other players when it comes to getting the chance to grab them. So you can't really plan. You can hope, but you can't plan. Cards zoom along the board at a breakneck pace and you just pull off whatever you can hoping they will eventually net you points. And that does not make for a compelling game.
I know I should probably give this an other chance with more players, but while I can see it being better, I can't imagine it being great. So far the worst game from this year for me.

Outguessing your opponents is important here, if you want to maximize usefulness of your own cards while minimizing your opponents' benefits. I like this social and almost psychological aspect of the game. Rest of it is simple collect resources and ship stuff to get money to buy cards to gain victory points.

Easy to teach. Definitely worth owning, fresh basic mechanism.

RATING: 7
On the surface, a very simple game of buying goods, collecting contracts to ship them, and matching ships to make money, then taking the time to buy VP cards with that money. In practice, vastly more entertaining because of all the motivation-manipulation, back-stabbing and general entertainment around the card selection.

Each of the four locations has N-1 cards with N players. The current player selects an area, lets everyone else optionally select a card, and then possibly takes one themselves. If they take a card, the turn is over, anyone who passed gets nothing. Otherwise they select another area, letting any remaining people pick the likely better cards

It's a subtle game of trying to figure out which areas you can brush off enough of the hangers-on so you can get the card you really want, while also wanting to not give them lots of free stuff, and often just deciding to take something slightly suboptimal for the delight of taking a turn away from someone who passed, hoping for an opportunity at something better.

First Impression:

A very interesting game, where the first player each round has some tough and iteresting choices to make. The concept is that he sets the area of purchases, but choses last so the game is a strange mix of trying to "oust" the other players in order to remain alone and claim what you want from an area.

This mechanism alone is very interesting, but it's not enough to keep the game to great levels. A good game still needs a decent theme to motivate the players and mechanisms/theme to put something at stake and/or create a sense of accomplishment.

Overall this game has s great idea that should have been utilised better.

The basics of Packet Row are fairly simple standard fare... you're buying cards and turning a set of the right goods cards, ships cards and contracts cards into money. There are some cards that let you break some of the game rules, some money cards and some cards that let you turn money into victory points at better than the 10-to-1 normal rate. There's nothing terribly new or unique there.

What makes this game interesting is the card selection mechanic. Every turn a new player becomes the harbourmaster. The harbourmaster decides where cards will be bought initially from one of four boards. Then every other player has an opportunity to buy a card at that location before the harbourmaster.

If any other player buys a card they're out for the round. When it gets back to the harbourmaster he can buy a card or choose a different area and repeat the process, but the people who have already bought a card no longer participate. If at any time the harbourmaster buys a card then the round is over and anyone who didn't buy a card is tough out of luck.

Any board the harbourmaster chose during the round has its cards flushed regardless of whether anyone bought cards there or not. Each board has a future market where you can see some of the cards that come out for the next turn. When x number of boards can't be refilled the game ends (where x depends on the number of players).

It's a really neat mechanic. In our first game it was hard for me to judge the pacing of the game and how important buying the convert money to vp cards were. Our initial game was a little awkward as one player basically gave up on turn one when someone took the card he wanted. I'd like to try the game again to get a better feel for it.

The game is all about the card-drafting mechanic, which to its credit is very unique and interesting. Reminds me a bit of The Speicherstadt in that your control ebbs and flows with the movement of the start player token around the table. My concern is whether this fluctuating control, when combined with the randomness of card draws, adds up to an experience that's too chaotic. Yet Speicherstadt holds it together despite the occasional frustration of seeing yourself unable to get the one thing you desperately need due to the way turn order and card draws pan out. Need more plays to assess.... this may be a keeper if we can get it played in under an hour.

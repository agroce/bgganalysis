Fantastic art, very colorful and overall well themed out! I specifically like the art of the card market and think most of the animals are very cute. The different animal decks are interesting and its fun that they have a matching theme. The game itself however I have not fully figured out it feels like. Even after playing quite a bunch of games. So far it seems to be collect some cool looking cards, use them a couple of times and then once one player starts building stalls playing a catch up race with the others and potentially lucking out in the end. Although I think there can definitely be some skill involved with doing some clever card counting and deck management, it still feels more lucky than really skillful. Perhaps with the right players and more plays will this game make more sense to me.

Mooie kaarten van dieren.
Deckbuilding op basis van de markt die gemeenschappelijk is voor beiden.
Kaarten die net op de markt komen, zijn duurder.
Je moet uiteindelijk een stall samenstellen van dieren van waarde 1 t.e.m. 8.
Hier kan je best niet te lang mee wachten, maar ook niet onmiddellijk doen, want die kaarten ben je daarna ook wel kwijt uit je deck.
Leuke dynamiek.
Niet gekocht, ookal geef ik het een 8, omdat het eigenlijk een 2 spelers-spel is, en er Engelse tekst op de kaarten staat. (Dus ook dochter kan het nog niet spelen)

A fun and fast playing card game where players try to use the unique powers of cards to build a deck and play certain values to the table. There is variability in the decks you play with that change the mechanisms for each game. The art is also very nice.

RATING: N/A
I didn't make a pledge for Dale of Merchant 2 because I had yet play the first one frequent enough to warrant me in getting the sequel.  But definitely I want to experience this game and see how good it is to see whether it'll be good for me to get this set to my game collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
TL;DR; Too luck dependent, and no room for real plans as cards come and go. 
---
Good looking, cute themed deckbuilder in the vein of more known titles like Star Realms and Dominion. Each game you choose five 'races' to play with. Cards are both money as well as "VPs". You have to strike a balance between increasing buying power and playing cards for their victory conditions. Cards are bought from the market, a line of five card slots with increasing auction prices for each slot.

I placed VPs between quotes since the goal is not to get the most VPs, but it's a race to play cards in increasing set values. You have to build eight sets of cards where the first set should consist of a value of 1, then 2, then 3, up to 8 for the last set. Since cards have a value ranging from 0 to 5, the later sets have to consist of multiple cards and they have to be of the same 'race'. The player who is the first to create set number 8 is the winner.

In the first game I played, the game dragged on way much longer than I liked. The set we played with, allowed one player to get a combination of effects that choked every other player from replenishing their hand each turn. In return, the other players did their best to to screw up his hand, so he never got to make the last set of 8.

That game took more than an hour, but I would think that's a rare case. In Dominion you sometimes have these botched games too, where decks are so messed up and polluted that it's no fun at all.

Update: Slightly less positive after my second game. In both games I played it wasn't the player with the best plan that won, but the luck of the draw. Also, I have concerns over replayability. After my second play I don't necessarily look forward to a third game.

Guess the author didn't have enough card space in Dale of Merchants 1 to lay down all the text he wanted to write. If you're into group book readings you may find something exciting about Dale of Merchants as you will be spending most of your time bending over the table to read paragraphs upon paragraphs of small text written on card stock.

Not having learned from his previous mistakes, the designer added one further luck based deck to reduce the experience of this game to a random toss of a dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Making a card's purchase price always equal to its buying power seems to leave this game unmanageable-- or maybe the acquisition arc for cards is just so different from other deckbuilders that I couldn't process it on one play? Dunno, the beautiful art certainly doesn't give an accurate sense of the game.

A provisional rating after one play. I like deckbuilders so I'm eager to see where this lands. (31.3.2017)

Good card games that managed to caught me off guard. I wasn't expected to have so much game in such a small package. I thought these would be fillers but these can easily be main events at some nights. Wonderfully strategic game-play, a lot of different animal factions to use and a lot of different tactics to utilize. Re-playability is high. It has a steep learning curve, because those players that have already mastered any animal decks have an advantage against those who haven't. I find very little differences between DoM 1 and DoM 2, they are basically the same game, only with the different animal factions that you can almost without limitations to mix together to form any king of decks. So these games as a whole deserve an 7/10.

This one straight up brings new blood to the original game. The factions are more complex in my opinion and people should start with the first one but man I love the thematic factions on this one. Sloths play their cards and they activate next turn, how funny is that? And the take that faction on this one is mostly passive-aggressive making actions harder to pull off for other people rather than stealing their stuff. I like this a bit more than the original. Quite recommend it.

The new animalfolk decks are great. They have new ideas and as usual, are quite consistently in character: the owls are wise and observant, the crocodiles bristle with mean interaction, fennec foxes are friendly and nice (but don't really care about who owns what), sloths do things the next turn and so on.

I'm yet to try the four-player team game, which sounds interesting.

Enthusiastic.

As gorgeous looking as the cards from the original game. Hilariously named groups of animal merchants too. I love the "Systematic Eurasian Beavers" that came as a Kickstarter exclusive with my set.

Acts as an expansion of sorts for the original as the sets can be combined. This is good for us as there are some decks that suit our style of play better. This might end up climbing up the ratings once we have a shot at mixing and matching the two games.

This did nothing for me. I like how you can pick and choose the animals you use from game to game, but the abilities really aren't all that interesting. And the way you win by building a market display is frankly kind of dumb. Cool concept, bad game.

Pretty much on par with the original. The dice thrower folk are a lot more interesting here but of course that is compensated by having another uninteresting folk in the mix.

Having different illustrations on the junk cards is a nice touch. 

With all these new cards, the lack of proper card effect explanations is starting to annoy me. The rulebook could definitely use an overhaul.

RATING: 6
More species, more cards, more of the same mechanics as the original, which makes for more selection when determining which animalfolk will be included in the game.  Deck building, tableau building, and with each species adding their own special powers, Dale of Merchants 2 is a good addition for anyone owning the original, but able to function as a standalone.  However, combining both sets does not allow for more players, as the downtime would be too long between turns.

Fun game though I really dislike the crocs: perhaps that's just a play preference but initial runs with them feels like it's just a tee-hee-take-that.   The variety is appreciated.

The combo possibilities are super gnarly, especially when you can weed out junk cards (4p game tonight where one player did and won 8-7-4-3) but it still felt like there's some nice opportunities for others to continue to be competitive.

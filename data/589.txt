I created a sweet PnP version with wood bits and fancy graphics. Got the cards from ArtsCow - and love the results. Now we're playing this like crazy. The game plays as expected: wild, random, whacky fun slinging spells, house-ruling as needed and running around with treasures stuffed under your robed arm. One of the few all out Ameri-trash games that I declare fun!

Total Beer and Pretzels game.  The best is casting the "You're Ugly" spell on yourself and then running towards people.  They can't look at you, and you get to blast them in the back.  *evil grin*  Drawback: too many bits.

If you want to win this game regularly, keep telling yourself, "It's a race game, it's a race game, it's a race game."

Personally, whether I win or lose, I think it's much more interesting to pin someone in a dead end hallway by creating a stone wall directly in front of them.  AFTER you've hit them with "Slow Death."

THE quintessential Beer and Pretzel game.  Plays best late at night and with a cold six pack.  Components are losy, game design is so-so, game play can be extremely entertaining.  This is not a game to take seriously.  If you do, its a definite buzz-kill.  Treat it like it deserves.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

Completely bonkers and chaotic, don't expect a balanced or predictable experience (especially with upwards of 500 cards).  The most fun you can have without taking your robe and pointy hat off.

Home made set.

Back in the day a great game. 

A classic beer and pretzel game, it suffers from  variable length and player elimination. If it came out today I doubt it would get much attention. But I enjoy it, but infrequently.

RATING: 4
A dungeon crawling card game were you try to kill the other wizard or steal his two treasures. Fun with a bit of tactics in manipulating your cards and the dungeon. With more than two players it becomes rather chaotic and unforgiving, since any player can be rather easily eliminated by removal of his two treasures. I'll pass. Loses points for component quality.

Move around a map and try to steal treasures from your opponents, using various spells and effects.  I have the 1991 edition, so it's a little out of date.  Fun game, and all the different spells give it great variety, but there are a few combos which are excessively powerful, and all the wizards are strong enough that direct confrontation rarely gets you anywhere.

Wiz-war is all about low productions values, funny artwork, silly mechanics and fun.  I still get a kick out of the Democratic Monster.  I had fun playing this, and even one of the expansions I believe, and it could even be classified as the granddad of M:tG based on the cardplay, interrupts, etc.  I have the little brown and white box edition, I never played the "fancy" big blue box, so I don't know if it got better or worse.  It holds a quite place in my heart, but I don't think I would play it again.

Played once as a three player (probably not the best number - two players fight it out, the other wins . .. ). Can't really see what the fuss is about. Lots of cards: draw the best cards do well, draw rubbish do badly. It does have some atmosphere and tension, which just about keeps the mind from wandering, but there are a lot better games out there. I can see why this might have been fun a decade ago but has not aged well.

Chaos rules whenever Wiz-War is being played: not only is it one of the most fun, unpredictable and interactive games I’ve ever played but it also excels at giving players countless chances of thwarting their opponents by casting nasty spells on them, which means lots of laughs, jokes and memorable happenings.

No carefully planned strategy survives the first round. [i](June 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - If there’s a game that deserves a 10 in my book that’s Wiz War: it’s the champagne game par excellence, the game that rewards taking risks and aiming at dangerous but wicked plays, the game where every card played comes with a nasty «take that!» grin and a malicious look.

There are so many things that make Wiz-War the perfect game: this is why after further dabbling with it (and shattering the dreams and hopes of my opponents en passant) it’s about time I raise my rating from 9 to 10 in July 2016.

We get rid of the "search for treasure" aspect and just try to kill each other. Hilarity ensues. One of the greatest games I have found that enables everyone to get really really intoxicated while playing. For the particular group I play "Wiz War" with, this is a plus. :-)

RATING: 8
This is another solid Fantasy Flight edition of a classic game. The game itself is very clean, light and chaotic with the fun largely being the combos which make one feel clever, the schadenfreude of your buddies' plans falling apart and the quick turns of fortune precipitated by a very chaotic game. Like with Cosmic Encounter, Fantasy Flight had the task of creating a ruleset and components which didn't get in the way of the game, light and silly as it is and they definitely succeeded. It's a breeze to explain and you're playing in no time. Wiz-War is a perfect "dessert" game after everyone has had enough of brain-burning main courses and wants to have a few good natured laughs to round out the evening. I'm very glad to have it in my collection.

I love this game!  The only thing that keeps it from a [10] is the crappy quality of the bits: cheap B/W cardstock boards and cards (not even vinyl-coated!) and fairly plain counters (cute cartoony artwork though).  If only Chessex would finally bring out their promised revision!  I've been waiting for it since they began advertising it in "Fall 2000"; several years later, I'm still waiting.  Come on, Chessex!

I had really been looking forward to this one, but I came out disappointed. It's fun enough but there's definite room for improvement. Overall it feels like the game wants to be more cutthroat than it actually is. It's just too easy to ignore killing people and go for the chests (it just seems like the more viable strategy). And this is coming from a pretty bloodthirsty group. Games went by a little quicker than I'd have liked, too. Perhaps things would get more heated with more than four (with the use of a second board).

My criterion for ranking games



http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder:  Every game plays out so differently. Depending on what type of spells each wizards has and what strategy each one tries the game gives a different story each game. Plus the spells themselves are so flavorful and fun. 

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Using your spells and deciding to run or fight are the decisions you make from beginning to end and the decisions are so much fun and affect how the game plays out.

3) Player interaction:   Combat, turning each other into stone, etc. This game has a TON of interaction.

4) Components/artwork: Pretty awful components, board, cards, etc.

5) Game length/complexity:  Perfect length of the game. Everyonce in a while the game will take a bit too long, but overall goes just the right amount of time. The complexity is not too much that it is too hard to teach.


Bottom line: This is a super fun game with combat, wizards, awesome spells, fantasy theme, great miniatures, and a great experience for 2-4 players.

The game hasn't aged well at all, but it still has some charm thanks to the HUGE variety of situations that can come up.  It can be really fun, with fireballs flying left and right and some guy stuck behind a wall or it can be REALLY dull.  Of course, the dueling wizards conceit has had a better run in a famous CCG that clearly owes a debt of gratitude to this predecessor.

Didn't care for this one.  Despite it's phenomenal reputation, it's largely overrated as being a "beer and pretzels" type game, when in fact it's just random tactics and pure luck that win the game.  There are no real strategies involved, it's just endless "Screw the other players" until someone stumbles across victory conditions.  This alone wouldn't be THAT bad if the game didn't take so darn long to play.

For some reason, memories of this game are not filled with warm fuzzy feelings.  Perhaps this is because I was expecting the game to be something it is not.  What it is, is a tooth and nail struggle to steal your opponent's treasure, while keeping possession of yours, throught whatever means you have at your disposal.  I have an older copy, but am looking forward to whipping up a PnP and giving this a few more plays to see if I need to revise my opinion.

Used to be one of my favorite games but I guess my game tastes 'grew up', plus it's nearly impossible to find anyone that will actually play it with you.  Rating has fallen because of this and the fact that Chessex has sat on this game for nearly a decade.

I didn't think this would be a good game, but it is. Sure, it's got player elimination, but that usually doesn't happen until late in the game. It's also a little overrated because people remember it fondly from the past, but it's still a fun game if you like wizard on wizard violence. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I love this game.  It's fast, furious, and has a great deal of 'screw your friends' moments.  Pay too much attention to one wizard and the others will swoop in for the win.  It's definitely a precursor to MTG, but with easier rules.  We keep hearing rumors of a reprint, but don't hold your breath.  I think these have been going around for years.  The only trouble I have is getting non-gamers to play, which surprises me.  Seems like a perfect light game to introduce new people to the gaming genre.  A custom 3D board would be sweet, I just don't have the time to make it.  BTW, play with some Reaper or GW minis for the wizards, it's a quick fix that adds flavor.

The king of the beer and pretzel games. It's old school for sure.  Really needs to be played several times back to back to get a good flow going and balance the luck.

A classic.  Even though its length is highly variable, and sometimes you're stuck with nothing to do on your turn for a long time, I always have a lot of fun.

The possible combinations of cards are very cool.  First 2 player game was really fun, but later multiplayer games never held up to the promise.  Number cards are almost always far more efficient to use for movement to get treasures rather than for combat or spells, and seemed the key to winning.  In multiplayer games, two players that fight it out are just wasting time and weakening each other while other players collect treasures (a standard free-for-all multiplayer game problem).  Needs additional victory conditions, e.g., some sort of victory points awarded for combat instead of treasure hunting as a different avenue to victory; or a team variant.

SOLD IT!

Fun light-hearted fantasy game with a little more "meat" then other mindless light-hearted fantasy games (Cheez Geek, Munchkin). Would probably make a good filler game while waiting for others to show up for a night of D&D.

I enjoyed the simple use of the 4 dungeon tiles to make a modular board which gets altered by the end of most games (doors appear, walls crumble, and even whole parts of the dungeon rotate). It's satisfying to have a part in all the mayhem, as you and other rats shase each other in a cruel maze.

It's a lot of laughs, a bit of strategy, and good value for a mini board game that fits in a box the size of a book (though the production value of the cards is a bit low).

P.S. the red wizard and his lightning bolts is the best!

[2 plays] Great fun.  I was cautioned not to take it too seriously and I certainly think that was the right advice.  But if you want to be a wizard and abuse your friends with a bunch of crazy magical smiting, this game is for you.  It definitely does not reward long-term planning; by the time your long-term plan could happen, first of all, a thousand things will have gone wrong to prevent it, and secondly, someone else will have won the game.  So don't hoard your resources.  Just come out blasting.  If you have a good spell, go ahead and smite somebody with it.  You'll be glad you did.

Look, I don't mind thematic games.  I just don't particualrly like games that seem to require no skill or planning and you have almost no control over.  This was, so far, the first and only game where I have asked to quit (admittedly, on what I blieved was the last turn of the game - the game ended up going on for several more turns).  While I still feel awful for walking out, I do feel that the game was *that* bad and that I was seriously wasting mytime.

I adore this game. Although the production values suffer this is an amazing experience game that involves more thought than one might initially believe.  Wiz War allows for some great plays and plays relatively quickly.  More intense with two, more fun with more.  I can see where a lot of CCGs get there influence here, and Richard Garfield has stated his admiration for the design.  The ultimate in beer and pretzel gaming.

A bizarre little gem that has gone through many a change over the years. Wiz War can best be described as chaotic. You try to run your little wizard all over the board trying to steal people&#039;s treasure while at the same time guarding your own. Things change on a moment by moment basis; the map, walls, your location - so you can never be sure of any long term strategy.

Well, this is different.  A very simple, very light game of running around a maze, fighting other wizards, and trying to steal treasures.  What makes the game exciting is the cards that have various spells on them that make goofy, random things happen. Like a giant slime, or a rosebush, or an Ugly spell, or a troll that wanders about punching things, or....

...you get the idea.  It's pretty fun.  Reminded me a little of Dungeon Twister, but I enjoyed it much more.  Probably worth someone reprinting sometime. (1 play)

Awesome chaotic beer and pretzel game.  You are wizards in a twisty dungeon with a handful of spell cards that you hose at each other as quickly as you can while trying to steal two treasures belonging to someone else while not losing your own two treasures.  Lots of wild effects and much fun coming up with interesting combos, especially ones that fry your opponents.  Someone usually wins with a totally unexpected series of card plays.  Very luck-driven so you can't take it too seriously but lots of interesting choices of what to do with your cards every turn and much enjoyment when a clever spell combo pays off.  :)

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2012)

Good light game reminiscent (to me) of Drakon. It has simple rules and lots and lots of “take that” moments, so the game is hugely dependent on the game group. 

I played a print N play copy so I can’t comment on the actual components of the game, however the copy I played was very well done, the boards are very similar to the Dungeon Twister ones but that’s where the similarities between the games stop.

The game is pure tactics, it has a lot of chaos and luck in it so you can’t plan ahead, but that’s ok because the game is short and fun. 

The key item seems overpowered to me.

Do not take the game too serious and you will be fine, just expect to pass a good time with your friends. The actual winner will be (most probably) decided by chance.

In conclusion, a good game for occasional play.

I have changed a lot during the years and, as a consequence, I now always dislike games that have the (almost) pointless “bash the leader”, “take that” and “in your face” mechanics. I (mostly) no longer enjoy this type of game. Having saying that, lots of my friends enjoy Wiz-War, so I think there can be a good game here, but is definitively not a game for me.

I have Kwanchai's redesign. I don't know how I feel about this yet, it may go up the list, but for the few times I've played it, I got frustrated that I could only act based upon the cards drawn. Many times I didn't have a decent spell to cast. Maybe if the cards were separated into specific piles? I can see that this game has a lot of depth that I've yet to tap, so currently it's an 8, but I could easily see it becoming a 9.

This is a great Beer&Bretzel classic, and even though the new version looks much more valuable, I sometimes prefer the old(er) version.

RATING: 6
Chaotic and unbalanced game that's all about combat and direct conflict. It hasn't aged very well, so you can see that a new version with twitch or two in the rules would benefit the game a lot, but still... It's fun!

The basic formula is pretty simple: each player incarnates a wizard and you can win either being the sole survivor or by stealing two treasures and drop them on your base. While trying to accomplish any of both assignments, you'll be creating chaos, rampage and destruction to both whoever gets close and the dungeon itself.

The core of the game is the spell deck. Spells range from extremely conditional to overpowered, so mechanisms heavily favour whoever is luckier. Also, there are a lot of combos, some with otherwise useless cards, emphasizing the luck factor in draws even more.

The game itself is fun if you don't mind luck, chaos, direct conflict and player elimination. So yes: it's pure ameritrash. The drawback is that, even fun, isn't something particularly challenging to play, but it's an excellent game when you are in seek & destroy mood.

reprint coming ? must have

Update : Thanks to my Santa I own this game since the last day of 2008.
Thank you so much.
After reading the rules I am going to do something what I have never done and probably will never do again. And still follow the rating guidelines. Ok I wanted to give it an 8 before playing.
I will update rating and comments after plays.

Update: 
I've went through the game a couple of times myself. Now I have to find a group of people that will like to play it with me. I've rated it an 8 right now Iwas going to wait until I had a real game in but this feels safe..
I think the experience could be anywhere between  9 to a 10 depending on what happens.  the game perhaps itself is a 6 to a 7.

To my secret santa of 2008. Thanks again. 

I'm ashamed I managed to play it last weekend for the first time. For people that play similar games this is a hoot to play.

OK, it's an awesome, classic game, but I'm actually kind of burned out on this.  [i](Everybody[/i] always wants to play this!)  This game has caused a lot of arguments; a lot of my cards have clarifications scribbled in pencil.

Update: Oh, why fight it.  I may pretend I don't love you, Wiz-War, but deep down you know I do.  This game is my group's standard filler.

I prefer it with three, as downtime increases with the number of players.  Four [i]fast[/i] players are OK, though.  Lousy with two.

This was supposedly the game that was the precursor to Magic the Gathering.  It is basically wizards on a map trying to retrieve items to their home.  It has spells, but I found the game had not aged well and the mechanics were clunky and it was boring.

RATING: 8
I can definitely see this as an inspiration for MtG.  It's an enjoyable game for two.  I'll have to try it with more players, but I wonder if it might bog down.  Rating may be subject to "new game" syndrome and fall a bit upon further play.

The things you can do with the cards are very clever! Smart use will weigh over the factor of luck of the draw. Still I more enjoy just going after the other players than collecting the treasures. I think it would be excellent if played as a deathmatch game!

For me, Wiz-War is too much zany and too little game. I played it once, and thought it was kind of a throwaway game -- old school in a bad way, kind of like AD&D 2nd Edition's game mechanics.

I like zany games, but they need to have some meat on their bones -- like RoboRally, which is silliness wrapped around a solid game, and works beautifully.

Games have a variable play time.  It can last 15 minutes or an hour.  Even so this game is pure fun.  Number cards are perhaps too important.  The player who draws more and higher value cards will often win.

Finally own a copy of the 5th Edition, thanks to a fellow Geek (thank you!). I used to play this a lot back in the early '90s, and I hope to get some games going with my friends soon. This is one of the best 3-4 player games ever made, a silly, chaotic game to play with your old D&D friends while drnking some beers. Anything goes. It's truly ridiculous that this game is so long out of print, and has not had a nice deluxe edition to this point. I can imagine how nicely Fantasy Flight, for example, could produce this game. The only knock I can make is that the rules on certain cards are ambiguous, and the graphics presentation is sort of primitive.

Homemade version with lots of custom cards. One of my favorite games. What really makes it fun is the almost infinite variety in the combinations of cards and the creative ways in which these can be used. It has a great balance of luck and tactics (and some strategy). The game plays quickly, and I'm always ready for another one once it's over.

RATING: 5
Not bad for what it is: a very light, luck-driven, screwage game with silly rules. Fun with the right group with the right mindset, but not suitable (to me, anyway) for multiple plays. Playing it once a year at BGG.CON seems "right" to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on 5th edition and Expansions #1 and #2. Yes the game has a random factor. If you don't adapt to random situations and the tactics that go with dealing with them, then you won't like this game. If you like tactical situations, magic, and a some randomness thrown in, you're in luck! Dropped to 8: Anytime I want to play this I'd rather play RoboRally. (2005) The components and difficulty of teaching were getting to me. The new edition fixes both of those well. Solid 8 for me. (2012) Robo-Rally fell and so does this. Both are fine, I'm just craving more depth. 2013 (from an 8)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I only have the classic set.  Fun game of casting spells and zapping the other players.  It's possible, though, to have to sit and do nothing most of the game if you get hit with a couple paralysis-type spells in a row.  But good fun, and plays pretty quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is another one of my favorite games.  It is absolutely intense to the end!  I love the theme, and the mechanics are clever.  My only gripe is I wish they'd replace the art with Magic quality graphics, 'cause it so takes that game out!

RATING: 8
Chaotic & fun just what I would expect from a game called Wiz-War.  The game can be quite challenging & I've been in some pretty hopeless situations but it didn't seem to deter my enjoyment.  Loaded with suprises, it's really up to each player's imagination in how they use their spells (combos!)

Once you accept that who wins can be pretty random and that some of the cards are way overpowered (permawarp), it's a great game...most of the cards feel powerful enough to be fun without being overpowered, the mechanics lead to lots of fights, everyone gangs up on those just about to win, and you never know what's going to happen next--all this in a good way.  The gameplay is very active; you never get bored when it's not your turn because you're too busy watching your friends backstab each other and you always have to watch out for anyone who might be about to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a beer-and-pretzels style game where you're a wizard attempting to steal treasures from the other players by moving around a maze-like board, and preventing others from doing the same.  You have a number of randomly-drawn cards with which you can move around better, attack other wizards, set traps, and defend yourself.  Component quality is horrible, but that's to be expected of a game of its age.  Personally, it's too random for my tastes.

RATING: 6
This is an old version I picked up at a Dundracon convention when I lived in Northern California.  Simple fun game, makes me wonder what the newer version is like.  This one is really small and based on the size of the box I have seen of the version in the stores now, my version does not have as much.  Fun though, and the games I have played are blisteringly fast, so it is easy to play a few games and move it on, perhaps passing it around the gaming group if your group is so large that one game cannot accommodate it and you have to play two games at once.
*Edit:  Played a game with my wife tonight and there was more to it than I remembered.  It took longer to play and was more complex than we thought.  At one point it looked like I was running away with it and my wife almost conceded a loss, but we kept playing and finished with a close game.  I captured her last treasure and dropped it on my home base with 6 hit points left to her 5.  With another turn having line of sight on me she had the tools to stop me and maybe even kill me for the win.  Much better game than I remember and I will make a point of getting olit to the table again soon.  Pretty sure my previous plays were not done correctly.

This is the perfect example of the type of games that I totally dislike. I like games in which you have reasonable control over your situation. This game is a complete chaos. Furthermore, wizards and spells are not my thing either.

This game just beat Trumpet for the title of "Random! Extreme Edition".

I don't think I would play this again. Why waste gaming time on this when there are so many good games available?

Former fantasy roleplayers may remember "the good old days" by playing this one: theft, bickering and group infighting are the order of the day. One of the most chaotic games ever devised; your success (even your life) depends entirely upon your card hand and your use of it. Extreme unpredictability adds to replayability.

WW is a fantastic game no Eurogamer should ever touch. It's purely tactical and part of the self-masochism is watching your plans (if you're foolish to do such a thing) go in smoke in less then a turn, as the other player rotates a sector, seals you behind a wall, or appropriates your treasure. On the other hand, if you're a "take that" player who enjoys screwing your fellow players, ruining other player's not-so-meticulous plans, following another player just to steal the treasure *they* worked so hard to steal, sealing up someone behind a wall (to which their mis-managed hand results in them having to pound the wall with their fist for the next twenty turns to get out), or watching the blood drain out of an opponent's face when you pull off a one-turn instakill, this is very much your game. If you don't think there's strategy in this game, there is none, but anyone who's experienced hand management games should find it pretty easily.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Chaotic, off the wall, totally unbalanced. Good old Wiz-War. Fast enough that when you get Amplify-Sudden Deathed you can shuffle up for a new game pretty quickly.

Component quality in this version kind of sucked. My copy is really showing its age. Will it ever be reprinted? If this game got the full FFG treatment it could really move up a couple of points.

This game was so far ahead of it's time. Not only did it advance the way cards were used in games, this is, conceptually, a proto-first-person-shooter. It's lucky, but you can do some cool things with the cards, and the base system is so simple that the game progresses well (unlike later attempts to bring an FPS feel to the tabletop).

The only real weakness is that it suffers from the classic "American" problem - the bash-the-leader mechanism is so good that the winner is typically the person who happens to be in the right position when everyone else has run out of ammunition (cf. Munchkin, Frag, Kill Doctor Lucky etc.)  The huge range of spells and effects make up for a lot though.

FINALLY got the 7th (Classic) edition in a trade. Then I hear the 8th edition is coming out soon. DOH!

Silly, random, Ameritrash goodness.

You play a Wizard trying to move across a dungeon to steal two of your opponents treasures and take them back to home base (essentially a 'capture the flag' variant). The heart of the game really lies in the cards you hold These are 'spells' or weapons you can use to attack other players, change the layout of the dungeon etc.

Fun in its time but gameplay might be too random for the modern Eurogamer.

RATING: 8
I recently made my own copy from the websites linked here. That ended up costing me more in terms of office supplies than if I had just bought a copy on the shelf, but I just can't find it in the local game stores.

This is a great game, two-player or multi-player. The huge variety of cards and the varying map layouts create massive replay value. The many summoned creatures and potential alterations to the map make for a highly chaotic game, but cardflow managment and wicked card combos keep this game an interesting tactical challenge. I would love to play a big game of this some time, with 8 or more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Certainly one of the great beer and pretzel games.  Magic the Gathering would never have happened without it.  Wacky, clever and with enough variation to warrant repeat play.  One of my favorites, even so many years down the line.  Expansions are a must.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light, filler fantasy game that is considerably better than Munchkin. It's also (usually) shorter than Munchkin, which is an advantage in a game like this. Yes, it's a chaotic luck-fest, but there is some strategy in the card play. I'd like to see an updated version of this game.

My dear friend, Wiz War.  I'm sorry we haven't spent more time together recently.  I promise I haven't forgotten you, it's just that Dungeon Twister caught my eye, looks so and acts so much like you without all the two hundred card baggage.  Still, I hope we'll still have time together, because you've always been there for me when I need a silly hour (or *wince* three!) long game of senseless violence.

Fantastic, somewhat random, and gives players a chance to get really creative with card combinations.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very light, and fun if you're playing with a fun group. But really it's way too random for me to really want to play again.

--- Summary ---
Create a dungeon using the square tiles. Each is a maze of walls. Players start in the center of their tile, with their 2 treasures on designated spaces. Deal each a hand of cards. On your turn, may move 3 (?) spaces for free, then spend number cards to move further. Spell cards may be cast for various effects (open/lock doors, destroy walls, attack other players, etc.). Move around, pick up other player's treasures (may only carry 1 at a time), and bring back to your tile. You're eliminated if your 2 treasures are collected by other players, or if you're killed by attacks/spells. Last player standing, or first to get __ treasures back home, wins!

Based on several plays.  This is one of the first games that got me into board gaming as an adult, so I always will like this game.  It does have a lot of luck and pretty much is a lighter filler game, but can be fun if played in the right mood with the right people.  I am rating the game with the expansions that allow up to 6 players and introduce monsters and artifacts to the game.

Fun, light game.  Gameplay can be cutthroat at times but because the game is fast playing people don't seem to get as upset as they would with games like Diplomacy.

I have made the Hirst Arts gameboards and think this is the best way to play.  I recommend other hobbyists with a creative bent do this.

Update - I now own and have played the FFG version several times.  I am enjoying the rules update.  Schools of magic improve set up time as it's now quicker to set up a play deck.  Larger and more colorful boards make the game easier on the eyes.  Ultimately, the experience is the same.  It just seems easier to get it to the table now.

The best part about this game is surveying the damage at the end when the dungeon looks like some medieval frat house littered with rubble, dead monsters, briars, tacks, mold, and innumerous discarded wands and stones and daggers and treasures. The second best part is how often someone seems on the verge of victory just before an opponent pulls out the perfect card and foils all his brilliant plans. Chaotic and random to be sure, but fun and full of laughs. And nobody ever wins without at least some clever tactics.

Stupid fun. It is hard to accept player elimination if the randomness of the game can turn a player into a sitting duck for several turns in a row. It is even possible for a player to miss turns until he finally dies! Still, the game may be OK if you are in the mood for it. Even then, however, there are more elegant/appealing random-only games out there.

Purchased because of its relation to Magic: The Gathering. I believe Richaed Garfield said this was a game that lead him to make M:TG. I love the theme. Wizards battling in a small dungeon, each trying to destroy the others or bring two of their opponents treasure chests back to their base to win. You get 3 movement spaces a turn and the cards dictate the rest of your actions (move, fight, cast). Add beer and pretzels and you've got the perfect scenario. With expansion packs 1 & 2 which I have yet to try.

Увидев хороший ПнП распечатал. Пока без расширений.

---

Я изначально не люблю лабиринты, в том числе в клеточку. Хотя я думал что сумашествия вроде как в Dungeon Twister тут не будет. Ошибся. Ряд проходов из комнаты в комнату напоминают порталы, что делает геометрию лабиринта запутанной. А повороты комнат всякие, хоть редко, но тоже встречаются.

В целом игрой правит рандом. И плохо не то, что своя рука случайна - всетаки ее можно кое-как управлять. Плохо что рука врага (а значит и его действия) - полные потемки.

К сожалению еще, разнообразие карт без допов меня совсем не впечатлило. Ну можно скажем оттолкнуть врага водяной струей и затем замуровать стенкой. Ну можно похихикать наблюдая как враг пытается убежать, не зная что у меня есть телепортация. Но вообще в игре нет ничего такого чтобы сказать "Вау!". С допами должно быть немного лучше, но и рандом еще больше усилиться. 

Итого - рандом который управляет игрой + умение придумывать как разыграть свои карты получше. Насчет времени игры не уверен. Возможны сильно затянутые ситуации.

---

С первым допом уже заметно лучше с разнообразием. Второй пока не переведен, но будет еще забавней. Это свыше 400 карт вроде. Вобщем с допами играбельно, хотя и не на мой вкус. Чисто фановая игра.

The original dungeon-crawler.  Tons of different spells to cast, a random (and sometimes changing) board layout, and straightforward rules make this one a timeless classic.

RATING: 5.5
Unbalanced and silly, which is why it's fun to play.

Just make sure that the game doesn't last longer than 20-30 minutes.  Flip the table, if necessary.

Light magic fun. Use your spells to attack others, knock down walls, control monsters, or put up barriers. Grab someone else's treasure and take it back to your home. Get 2 and win the game. Lots of skillful play and be used to move around the board. Very good little game.

I like chaotic games like this. I painted up 4 magicians and their chests and I build up the maze with MasterMaze components, so it looks good too. I will post pictures when I find the time.

RATING: 10
One of those games that I always want to play.  Dealing with the randomness of it all is really part of the strategy.  All your plans must be flexible or you are sure to end up trapped in a corner punching at the wall.  So much light silly fun should entertain anyone for at least a while.

Random and unbalanced, but fun if played quickly.  Better than Munchkin (which may be faint praise).

Fun to play.  The best part is playing this with the same crowd and making up your own spells.

RATING: 10
I know, I know, the rating is biased as hell. But this is my single most favorite game of all time and I will defend its honor against all odds!

I can see it not clicking with everybody. I can see people thinking its silly and frustrating. But I adore it, could easily play a ten hour marathon and still not be bored by it.

Still working on my set -- and I should get on with the update of my article. It is by far the most expensive game in my collection - and I do have a couple big boxes on the shelves :D

Pretty fun but quite random.  Great for the humor value more than long term strategic play.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty fun chaotic duel game. You have enough control so it's not annoying and a large deck of cards gives it a lot of replay value. Playing with teams or maybe custom scenarios could be a lot of fun too. Might need to add some house rules to up the play time, sometimes it's far too quick.

While playing, I had the idea of decks that were different schools of magic but apparently this is somewhat implemented in the new FFG version. My idea was still a little different than that.

Better reprint before someone comes up with a nifty replacement.  I'm losing the urge to play it again.

(Trade Interest: medium) this is a fun and erratic game.  i've played this many times over the years, and it still remains one of the best silly games.

With expansions, this game can be quite fun. Although, there seem to be a few holes in the rules. But if you want beer & pretzels, this one's got it with extra salt!

RATING: 7
a favorite beer & pretzels game, wizards duel and play capture-the-flag in a maze, we made lots of our own cards and houserules just like everyone else over the years, traded this to get new shiny FFG version...

RATING: 7
Lots of scope for clever cardplay and sudden reversals of fortune. This actually works pretty well for two players, too.

RATING: 10
This is a great game!  In my opinion this game gave birth to Magic the Gathering and other card game.  It is easy to get into, and your imagination is your only limitation (and the cards in your hand). One of my favorite aspects of this game is it very versatile and out of the 1000+ games I have played no two have really ever been alike.  I would love to see Chessex re-release this game with some of the qualities of MTG.

This is my rating for the Chessex Sixth edition which had some problems:

- The components was of a lousy quality. 
- You could make permenant walls and either box your own teasure in so it couldn't stolen or box you opponent in, so he would have to stay there during most of the game until he found some way to escape. 
- If you got the wrong setup you could get killed before you even got you first turn.

Even with all these problems I it's still a funny game (unless you the one that get boxed in or killed in the first round of cause).

The best beer & pretzels game ever.  The experience of playing the game is what makes it fun, over who wins or loses.

RATING: 9.5
The only reason it didn't get the 10 is the game has many little problems (all stemming from how a given card may be read by deferent players)but despite that it is still loads of fun ( probably my favorite game ) and my friends and I play it several times a month.

RATING: 8
A great game, over the top humor and screwing your friends.  The treasure stealing keeps the game from just being a slug fest and keeps the game from being too long. A 3D home-made set does help a lot to get people interested..

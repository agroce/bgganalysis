Probably Divided Republic doesn't deserve exactly a 10, but as long as I'm proud of helping this project to see the light, I have a special feeling with this game.

I presented David to Patrick when the KS campaing wasn't much promising wishing he could help with the artwork. David worked against the clock but the first draft of the board we upoaded to BGG helped strongly to push up the fundings. That October 2011 was really exciting until the last day of the Kickstarter Campaing when Divided Republic project was succesful and made happy some guys that I really appreciate.

I'm very proud that David's final board is, definitely, gorgeous!

Overly ambitious.  I would love a good 4 player Twilight Struggle-esque election game and this might have been it.  The cards are simply way too fiddly and way too powerful for the game to be balanced out.  With a simpler deck this could have been a real winner. 

On the other hand, the game might have doubled down on its complexity and really developed something like an American Die Macher.

Either would have been fine, but instead it floats adrift, too long and fiddly to be loved by the Tammany Hall crowd and to simplistic and chaotic to entice the CDG crowd.

I kickstarted this and finally got it to the table.  The group I played with really liked it.  The intereaction between players was great!  There was a great ebb and flow to the game.  It was slightly chaotic, but what presidential race is not?  The game also captured the historical feel of the time period.  I can see this quickly becoming a favorite game.... not quite 1960, but still excellent!

Can be played as a strategy game and is fun. Or with political and history buffs it can be an all nighter of fun! (I'm told I didn't get the jokes - I didn't know there were any) Played once and want to play again. Backstabbing and numbers. Strangely fun - as I'd normally ignore anything 'political'.

RATING: 4

I love the theme and idea of this one, but I found the execution lacking. It’s as if someone played Twilight Struggle and found the way the cards worked to be a problem so they made a more wide open game, but ironically, the openness kills it. It’s just a free-for-all with take-that cardplay. Decisions would be interesting and nuanced if cards triggered Ops and Event or some cards were dependent on others to be played first. The result is that you just plop your Ops and play obvious events. 

And I absolutely disagree with the decision to make scoring cards played optionally. Having to play scoring cards is part of the genius of Twilight Struggle; nerfing that here removes a great deal of the tension. Since VPs are not permanent until the final scoring, you are minimally incentivized to ever play them over cards that will help you longer term. Much would have preferred that when drawing cards, you have to take 1 scoring card each turn (randomly of course) that must be played. That would've focused things in interesting ways.

I'm also still annoyed at the error in Ops on some cards (how can you miss that?), embarrassing spelling mistakes, and Abe-eeples that don't stand up.

Received in trade for an extra copy of Discworld: Ankh-Morpork...can't wait to play!

Well, color me unhappy...the quality is great, the theme is fascinating and resonates, but chaos is king with little potential for strategy (IMO). You need to react tactically at each moment knowing that powerful event cards can undo several actions in an instant. I wish that the game would have some pace or constriction with required or mandatory events, but it does not.

I'm actually considering increasing this one to an 8 again. I haven't seen the designer on the game's forums in a while, so there are still issues with a few details of the rules, but if there's just four people it's very likely that this gets played. Definitely not tired of it yet!

RATING: 8.8
I had previously hesitated to rate this game because I am, after all, the designer's wife. But after giving it some thought, I think it is appropriate that I post this rating.  First, as an avid gamer myself, I think my views are as valid as anyone's.  Second, as many of you married men can attest, wives are often the first to tell you when an idea you have is a bad one. No different here - although I do try to be nice about it :). So bottom line is, I helped Alex play test, made the Kickstarter video, etc., because in my view it was - and is - an excellent game. 

Divided Republic has been compared to Twilight Struggle. I love TS; it is one of my all time favorites. But one aspect of TS/1989 that I am not crazy about is the fact that there are mandatory events. To me that increases the chance element and decreases the choice element.  I like that DR does not force you to play events that are harmful to you. 

As far as the deck size, I appreciate that there are so many cards because it enhances replayability.  You don't know that a certain card will come up during a game, and in my view, that's a good thing. In addition to promoting variety, it helps level the playing field a bit between new players and experienced players, who 
can't count on their favorite card coming up at some point. 

I've seen some refer to the game as chaotic - yes it definitely is. It is not as "structured" as many of the games we've become accustomed to.  (For example, the card size which lessens predictability in terms of what resources your campaign has at its disposal, the fact that "cutting side deals" is a valid strategy and has been implemented well in many of the games I've played although there is no formal "negotiations phase").  It is, by design, very open-ended. And I view that as a strength.  I think it makes for a fun game, and that it also accurately reflects the chaos of politics at the time.

Seems like a theme rich, but otherwise weak implementation of the Twilight Struggle card-driven area majority system.  Dragged quite a bit for me --just not enough options and the area influence mechanic with a mostly random locking mechanism played far too long for these mechanics.  Components were generally good, but the cards were average quality at best --not a good thing for a primarily card game.

Players take the role of one of the four presidential candidates in 1860. Essentially it's a four-player version of 1960, and as such it works decently well. It has the same problems as 1960 as well, in that it's a lot of playing cards to place cubes, and that's about all you've got.

A fun game to say the least.  A lot of "cloudy history" in the box, and it could have profited from a card explanations sections of the rulebook, but I don't have to know the historical significance of every event.  Some really fun plays can result.

My one real complaint is that it is so difficult to repeat the historical majority of the electoral college victory in this game.  It seems to always get booted to the House.  Makes it difficult to "win"

RATING: 7.1
Fun game; good time. The cards are very good (hats off to the designer). Victory conditions need some help (we just went with whoever gets the most electoral votes wins; can't see anyone ever getting a 152? for an out right victory), but, that didn't stop the fun.

Very good screw your neighbor game; lots of laughs. Also, a very simple game and easy to understand rulebook.

Game doesn't really simulate or provide any historical insight into the election (no tradeoffs, dynamics, etc).

Although, I felt there were a lot of meaty decisions in terms of where to defend - where to attack, I would have really liked to see more political options for players. And, more chrome would have been nice: there is almost none in this historical rich setting. None-the-less, we'll be playing it again.

RATING: 7.55
Suffers from serious and disturbing historical inaccuracies.


A section of the historical notes on the back of Lincoln's character card says that "[the] nomination, incidentally, was acquired via a backroom deal with future Secretary of War Seward [sic; Seward became Lincoln's Secretary of State, not his Sec/War], who was promised that Lincoln, in the event of a victory, would not run for a second term. Lincoln's decision to run for a second term enraged Seward, and more than one conspiracy theorist has suggested that he may actually have played a role in plotting Lincoln's assassination."

This strange portrait of Seward as "enraged" when Lincoln ran for a second term doesn't jibe with other sources—for example, Doris Kearns Goodwin's [i]Team of Rivals[/i]. And honestly—taking the time to mention that some conspiracy theorists have suggested that Seward might have played a role in plotting Lincoln's assassination?

Was it worth the space to say this? Was it not worth mentioning (the game does not mention) that Seward was nearly assassinated in an attack coordinated with the attack on Lincoln?


As for this "back room deal" in which Seward gave up the nomination in exchange for a one-term Lincoln, many, many historians don't tell the story that way.


I'm disappointed about the reference to Seward as Secretary of War (that was Edwin Stanton), and the spelling of "No Nothings".

But this last is only the beginning of the mechanical errors.


This game desperately needed an edit, and then it needed a dutiful proofread. Instead, it is rife with basic errors of English and grammar, and of typesetting. Text dropped from pages, rules missing, historical information incorrect or misprinted.


It's a very enjoyable game. But it didn't deserve this treatment, either in historical presentation or in production.


[b]These embarrassing errors, and many others, induced me to rate this game low for some time as a statement.[/b] Gameplay excepted, a prime example of many of the things that are going wrong with today's board gaming world.


[b]Update:[/b] The designer confirmed that the back room deal actually most likely involved not Seward, but Cameron:
[q="Sol Invictus"]I don’t particularly buy the theory that Seward was involved, but it’s a good story.[/q]
As we find, for example, in Michael Burlingame’s [i]Abraham Lincoln: A Life[/i] [I:617], the backroom deal involving Cameron had nothing to do with Lincoln’s promising not to run for a second term as president. Nor was that a promise Lincoln ever made to Seward. We know of no promises made between Lincoln and Seward over the 1860 nomination. Doris Kearns Goodwin specifically describes Seward as “shocked” [250] to find that he had not won the nomination.


I'm curious about the designer's sources for his claim of Seward's enmity toward Lincoln, not least because the work I mentioned, [i]Team of Rivals[/i] (winner of the American History Book Prize, and the definitive work on the relationships between Lincoln and the members of his cabinet), written as the result of 10 years of research conducted by Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission member Doris Kearns Goodwin, describes a Seward–Lincoln relationship diametrically opposed to the relationship implied in the description of Seward as “enraged” at Lincoln.

She describes, over hundreds of pages, using hundreds more pages of intimate letters and diaries sourced from Seward, Seward’s family, the remainder of Lincoln’s cabinet, and Lincoln, how the relationship between Lincoln and Seward grew into a deep, personal, and enduring friendship.

[q="pg. 577"]No one understood better than Seward the absurdity of the claim that he was the acting president. By the fall of 1863, he had both accepted and respected Lincoln’s consummate control of his cabinet, and [b]the relationship between the two men “had grown very close and unreserved,” Fred Seward observed[/b]. “Thrown into daily companionship, they found, not only cordial accord in most of their political opinions but a trait in common not shared by all their contemporaries. That was [b]their disposition to take a genial, philosophical view of human nature, and of national destiny[/b].” Such intimate cooperation benefited not only both men but the country at large.[/q]
[q="pg. 652"]Seward had hoped to get away but did not feel he should leave Lincoln in this trying period, when “one difficulty no sooner passes away than another arises.” His presence buoyed Lincoln, for he never lost faith that all would be well. While Seward agreed that “the signs of discontent and faction are very numerous and painful,” he refused to panic, believing that “any considerable success would cause them all to disappear.” So long as ordinary people retained their faith in the cause, a faith evidenced by new enlistments in the army, Seward remained “firm and hopeful,” convinced that Lincoln would see the country through. Stanton provided additional reassurance to the beleaguered president. [b]The relationship among Lincoln, Seward, and Stanton had strengthened over the years.[/b] Welles observed that “the two S’s” had developed “an understanding” enabling them to act in concert supporting the president. Though Stanton lacked the genial temperament that won both Lincoln and Seward countless friends ...[/q]This selection, by the way, is from August 1864—smack in the middle of Lincoln’s re-election campaign.

[q="pgs. 668–669"][b]Lincoln’s friendship with Seward had deepened with each passing year. “His confidence in Seward is great,” observed Welles that autumn [1864]. Seward “spends more or less of every day with the President.” On subjects “of the gravest importance,” Seward was the president’s “only confidant and adviser.”[/b] ... Though some still considered the talkative New Yorker the “power behind the throne,” Seward had long since understood that Lincoln was the master. “There is but one vote in the Cabinet,” asserted Seward, “and that is cast by the President.” Two days after the election, [b]Seward told a crowd of supporters, “Henceforth all men will come to see him, as you and I have seen him. ... Abraham Lincoln will take his place with Washington and Franklin, and Jefferson, and Adams, and Jackson, among the benefactors of the country and of the human race.”[/b][/q]
[q="pg. 706"]... in watching Seward and Lincoln together, Hay had recognized that the secretary of state had been the first cabinet member to recognize Lincoln’s “personal preeminence.”[/q]

I seriously question the amount and quality of the research into the relationship between Seward and Lincoln that preceded the designer's unfortunate paragraph, whose material was included in part because it was "a good story." :shake:

I certainly find no basis in the historical record for claiming that Seward was “enraged” upon hearing of Lincoln’s second campaign for the presidency (so enraged, the designer claims, that some conspiracy theorists suspect him of complicity in Lincoln’s assassination).


I call foul on this.

If a game purports to be historical, it ought to teach history. Relating stories because they ‘sound good,’ let alone stories heard 14 years ago in an undergraduate class, isn’t doing the work of a historian. :([color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

RATING: 5
Divided Republic is certainly the shortest multiplayer CDG I've come across, essentially taking the 1960 engine and trying to develop it into a 4-player experience. 

1960 is a terrible game. Divided Republic is significantly better, but ultimately comes across as flavor over substance. Building board position via OPs is too straightforward and often dull. Events themselves are either really good (speeches, scandals, etc) or rarely worth playing over the OPs (in particular the events that effect everyone like shrinking hand sizes or doubling OPs value - extremely situational). The minority of events that are worthwhile produce huge swings in the game state. And of course, much like 1960 (and, frankly, most non-TS CDGs), the events are surprisingly uncreative in their effects (remove cubes, add cubes, make a state off limits, flip a state, etc). 

The lockdown mechanic is probably the best part of the game. The hilarious chrome rules around Lincoln and South Carolina get a thumbs up from me, though they're of almost no practical consequence. It's nice to see overcontrol brought back into the 1960 system, even if the event workarounds are pretty mindless. 

Divided Repuclic also allows players to always choose between events and OPs (never both, as in Twilight Struggle), ostensibly to increase player choice. In reality, Twilight Struggle is filled with far more interesting choices - tougher, deeper, more nuanced, and more plentiful.

Divided Republic currently seems to be compared with Twilight Struggle or 1860 but the complexity of the game's mechanics is lower than either of those two games. Although DR is a card-driven game (CDG) I would characterise it as a Euro-style placement and area control game with a strong Amerigame-style theme. It is not a CDG wargame, and it is not a straight two-player tussle like Twilight Struggle. The strength of DR is as a 4 way 4 player struggle - so - more difficult than most CDGs in this aspect, but generally easier in gameplay and learning.

RATING: 3.5
so...boring. worst election game we have played.

here is the thing. First, the game indicates there are four things you can do - play cards for points, or an event, or a poll, or a speech. It is a lie. See, Polls and speeches are EVENTS! So, really you can only do two things in the game.

Second, most events affect one player - so in a four player game if you target a player with an action - all that happens is the other two players come out ahead.

The strategy is so simple my dog figured it out. Win enough votes to be in the top three - but win the most states for the tie-breaker. Only, here is the thing designers of the game - if no candidate wins enough votes, the HOUSE determines the winner, NOT the electors. So, the game lacks basic understanding of American political process.

The components are nice - we liked the period art. But there are several things that would have been nice - and since so little is included to begin with, a little more would be nice.

Just realized how much I disliked this - and dropped my rating further.

RATING: 6
We played the evening before election night.  I was enticed by the theme, but had some concerns after reading the rules.  I have played card driven games only slightly, and the OP value or card text option seemed a bit narrow.  I also had hopes that the game would play in an evening.  

What I found was that the game was slow to get through, as the players were not sure what they should be doing, and the desire to read and evaluate all your cards injected some pauses into the game.

All that said, we really had some fun with this game.  It is a total "puss" game.  You stab and jack your opponents, and just hope your cards are better than his.  

Overall everyone had fun.  But the evening was drawing to a close , so we jumped to the general election after the third (instead of 6th) turn.  This meant we didn't really use much of the regional polling, and only one region was locked down prior to the end.

So we did miss some of the midgame nuance, but I think I saw enough to give this game an initial rating.  I have selected "6" as I did have fun with the game.  But I doubt I will want to play a lot of it.  Also, the game was fun because of my opponents, and not so much because of the clever game mechanics.

The theme is inspired, and the game components help propel the theme.  But I wish there had been a few more trimmings to help lock in the theme of the game.

Sold off, as I didn't really have enthusiasm for additional plays.

RATING: 5
There are rough edges to this one, but I found the game entertaining throughout.  There are some very powerful cards and I am not sure ops values always line up with the power of the event as an alternative action.  Players will need to work together to keep opponents in check.  In addition, there is a chance that everyone could lose if South Carolina secedes or no one wins outright or via the tiebreaker.  Thematically, that makes sense, but one may be frustrated if the game ends with no winner after 2-3 hours!  Each player is a different party with a unique ability and/or weaknesses.  Check FAQ and errata before playing as there are ambiguities in the cards.  Wish there would have been a card manifest with a description of each card and what it does...

Enjoyable election game, I like the theme and historical flavor of this one. It does suffer from some unclear rules and unanswered errata type questions.

A little like a meaner, more frenetic twilight struggle. Platform Speeches work REALLY well as a way to remove PCFs. The factions play differently, even if the Constitutional Unionists feel like they don't have a chance. In the end, timely and strategic play will win the day.

Has that Twilight STruggle feel but without being forced to play the other side's events, lacks tension (and historiocity). A couple of cards are complete game changers, while most others seem to rarely outpace their numeric values. Electoral ties seem almost inevitable and player ties all too common. Seemed like a lot of time spent on nothing.

Yes, it is a good game, no it isn't the 4 player 1960 I was hoping for, but I'm fine with it. It isn't as polished as 1960, but it is much more mean since you hurt only 1 of the other 3 players when you play events more often than not. The board design could've been done a lot better and the big "5" cubes should've been a bit smaller. Still though, an 8 for me after one play.

This game modeled the 1860 US presidential election, which apparently was a real four-way race in history, as an area control game with CDG elements.  Sounds cool, eh?  Unfortunately, I found the execution to be lacking. What happened was that people drew poll cards and were able to "lock" states early, effectively removing those states from the game in their favor.  By the end of this very long game, so many options were removed that the players could do very little to affect the outcome.  The game was decided pretty early (or at least some players were eliminated), but the game kept going on and on.

While the game is unplayed, I did read the rules. Feels like a lighter, less controlled version of Twilight Struggle, but for 4 players. I have a feeling it will play best with 4 and ultimately just ok with 2 or 3. Still looking to break this game out, but now that I have the rules read, this should be able to at least come to the table. Components range from good to meh. The tokens especially were rather difficult to get out of the cardboard sheet. The card stock is ok, but at least the wooden cubes are a nice quality. Not sure if it's mold or dust on them, but they were accruing something on them.

I am a bit worried about the rules however. They seem to have added historical flavor over usability. The first few games we play will probably be a bit rough around the edges.

My favorite four player game. Reminiscent of Twilight Struggle and Campaign Manager 2008, but with twice the players. Three to four hours in length. So many four player games end up in a two vs. two player situation, and these rules don't allow for that. There is a single winner, teams just don't make sense (other than ganging up on the leader, but even then, it's not often clear who that is). This may move up to a 9 after a few more plays.

I love historical themed games, but this one falls short. The inevitable comparison will be with 1960, which I think is the better game by quite a margin.

I am not 100% sold on the two player game yet, but with four players this game is great.  It is brutal, mean and cut throat.  Fortunes can swing wildly and there is a lot of unpredictability.  The political theme and the historical flavor are captured very well.

I really need to try this with 4.  I played a 2P game and it was fun - it reminded me a lot of 1960 ... but having 4 players in this one would REALLY make it a challenge

After much ringing of hands and many delays, the game has finally been released. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed designing it!

A lot of, not very interesting, cards meant that this felt a lot like an inferior (4 player) version of 1960. The gameplay is very similar, but seemed less polished here and with even fewer interesting options - no debates or issues track to fight over.

The polling is an interesting option, where being first seems useful as you get more cards, but being last is actually most beneficial as no-one can undo your actions. The lack of variety in the cards (and with most of them being of equal value) meant that having one (or even 2) more made very little actual difference.

A shame.

un 1960 qui se joue à 4, avec des évènements plus diversifiés. Pas wow, pas mauvais non plus.

Nothing particularly new but decently fun. It goes on at least one round too long and achieving victory via a majority score seems unrealistic in a 4 player game. Also there is no story arc to the game - each round plays out the same. I might enjoy this more with 3 players.

This hits a sweet spot for me personally. I'm a hardcore Civil War buff; this is a good snack-sized game after tackling something meatier.

I have found it very simple to teach and to play. Quite a bit of screwage if that's your thing. The end can get a little wonky-- twice now the player with the least number of votes has won the game because no one else had hit the magic number and he had the most states.

Only one thing to do with OPS,  Bland Events,   production value problems,   A good idea with a failed execution.

Similiar to 1960 with four people and lacking the tension that 1960 has. Not really sure what I don't like about this game it just fell very flat me. There are too many pieces of this game that just miss the mark. Also I never really got the flavor of the theme.

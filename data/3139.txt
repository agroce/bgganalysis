A light game about exploration.Nice mechanics (the backpack) and modular board that stresses the sensation of a &quot;real&quot; adventure.Always fun also for non gamers, the last game turns are often amazing.

Nice exploration game with lots of theme and plays quickly for a big box game. A couple of strategies available but it's difficult to win if you don't get to the temple

RATING: 9
Great adventure type game, plays well with 3 to 5 players and had very nice bits.  First impression was it played slow, but that was just the group I was playing with.  Most games can finish in 60 to 75 minutes.

RATING: 7
Tile-laying exploration game with great components, good scalability, and multiple paths to victory.

The goal is to obtain the most gold ("points"), and this can be accomplished by: a)obtaining an aumulet, which you get by getting to the temple on the other side of the board, b)gold, including bonus gold, which is also obtained when you get your aumulet, c)obtaining treasure after completing adventures (you won't always be able to get the treasure even if you complete the adventure however), d)obtaining majorities in completed adventure types.

Has a great mechanic in that you are carrying a backpack, and so the more resources you collect, the more limited your movement.  Resources are needed to accomplish goals such as completing adventures, and digging up treasure, as well as completing "ordeals".  You may need to complete ordeals when you are blocked by the tile placement.  Tile-laying is important in that it can be used to block others movement, facilitate your own movement, and you obtain discovery tiles whenever you place a tile.  Discovery tiles can be traded in for resources, sort of like an extra action.

The board, being modular, is different every game, and the game offers different strategies to win.  You can win and never reach the temple, by simply working on getting alot of treasure and obtaining adventure majorities.  You can also win by racing towards the temple, getting the aumulet, and the bonus gold, as well you get a gold piece each turn thereafter.  The game only ends if each player obtains an aumulet or if the payout gold runs out, so the race strategy is also very viable.  Of course a mixed strategy of eventually getting the aumulet, while completing some adventures and getting some treasure also works well.

Surprising that this game was never printed in English, as it's very good.  If you like Kramer games, this is a must, and if you like Euro games in general, this is a pretty safe purchase.

A light game of exploration and tile placement. I had fun even though I really wasn't considering my moves well enough to complete. I have been told that playing with less players sees many fewer tiles played. Our five player game saw the full board created, so I would suggest to play with the full allotment of players for maximum enjoyment.

Excellent exploration game: gorgeous components, interesting game play with lots of tactical options and some meaningful strategic ones, fun medium-weight game play with just the right balance of luck and strategy, great theme.  Even if one or two playings don't impress you, try playing a few more times - check that you're using the correct rules (you keep your Pearls at coastal villages, etc.), and learn the properties of the different equipment types, and you'll see that this is indeed a great game.

RATING: 7
Nice exploration game but you frequently run into situations where one or more players get cut off through luck of the draw and never get access to the treasure. There are other ways to pick up points so this doesn't necessarily put those players out of the game but more often than not it makes the game much easier for one or two players. Lost Valley is a similar and better game IMO.

Lots of strategy with a theme which works.  I love the backpack mechanic (the more you carry, the slower you move) and having to decide if one should over-extend themselves or just go slow and steady.

Another of those where the English edition of the rules would help. Tried it at Essen, and reckon that it has the potential for a good game, but am reluctant (after one playing) to give it a better rating until I've had a chance to assess it's full playability.

I would rate this a bit higher if it weren't for the end scoring at the temple, which usually ensures victory for the first player there. Certainly more fun than, say, Tikal, and just as thematically excellent.

{1 play, 5 players} Well... I liked it... but mostly because I'd heard it could bog down or get tedious going back and forth, collecting things... and neither of those things happened.  It was fun, and even with five, moved at a nice clip.  The backpack mechanic is cool, but it's kind of wasted, since you're never really making large moves - well, we weren't.  I mean, if you're just gonna explore the next tile (usually the one you flipped), you don't need to move more than a few spaces (usually one).  And since most of the tiles have a cost to enter them, you often CAN'T move that many spaces, making the whole 'should I load up or not?' decision moot.  Yeah, it's solitaire-y, but no more so than Entdecker, really (and definitely less so than Samarkand).  It's not gonna be a clasic for me, but for now, I definitely want to play it again.

RATING: 5
my only play is with 2P, which is perhaps odd.  i also find it odd that one has to overtake an adventure type in order to secure it.  player 1 wins one, gets the VPs.  player 2 wins one, player 1 keeps the VPs.  couldn't you just put it back in the pool if there's not a lone majority?  seems more fair.  anyway, i like the game so far and i'm curious to see how it scales.  good theme, fairly solitaire, but quick turns and resolution.  dig the encumberance mechanic.  after another play with 5P it's hard to rate, since it appears that a bunch of the rules were wrong.  i'll need to read it myself to have more of an opinion, but it's still hard to imagine this one holding up to very much replay.

Good exploration game.  Backpack mechanic works quite well to limit what the players attempt to do and how they proceed.  The game tends to have a higher luck factor in how the exploration tiles are scattered.  The right combination can make or break a particular player's efforts.  Luckily the game also has several tactics that can be pursued.  A key to success is picking the right tactic for your location and efforts. [GTI Code: TPCD]

Exploration/adventure game with awesome bits and a cool backpack-limited movement mechanic. Not a game I would really consider taking out to play with the serious strategy gamers, it does really well with family and non-gamer friends. Unfortunately, it tends to drag with the non-gamers abd I'm finding less and less appealing. If you can immerse yourself in the adventure theme, you should have fun. Down from an 8.

Interesting backpack mechanic. I did think that the winner was pretty much automatically decided by who races to the temple first after the first couple of plays, but actually on the third play the winner was the person who dug up most treasures and obtained most majorities (though the fact that the person who raced to the temple in that game had the misfortune to explore the same Lake ordeal three times may have something to do with it!)

RATING: 7
With 1 play,it just seemed "change this to that",random enough to take the fun out of the exploration element,as the main problems is that all regions have the same "character".Change this to that resource.It would have great potential if the tiles were a lot more distinguishable from eachother.

It is decent, easy to play, and doesn't drag, but it really lacks the extra oomph that Lost Valley has, I think.  You don't get as much of a sense of exploring.

9/09 - played with five.  More of a resourse management game than exploration.  It is much better with five as it becomes a race, as well.  Boosted rating up to 6.5

Under-appreciated!!!  Pick-up-and-deliver with a purpose... good race game.  Has a minor puzzle/logic element.  Sometimes you have to drop everything in order to haul-hiney to reach the end tile on the same turn as the leader.  Incorporates elements of exploration, majority control and "racing".  Tactical tile plays can hinder your opponents.  Cool movement system is based on the emptiness of your backpack.

The game seemed to bog down a bit at the end with players needed to survive three adventures in a row just to reach the goal space.  This necessitated a lot of running back to base camp for supplies.  I would have liked more ways to resupply in the field.  I did like the fact that you could win without reaching the goal space at all, just by collecting treasures and adventure bonuses.

9/6/06 - even though I know some people who own this - they are threatening to move away - I figured I'd better get a copy for myself.

This game features a different board every game (you build it as you play). You can race to the temple for the bonus gold or try to gain the most influence over all the adventures and dig up as many treasures as you can for the win. Really enjoy playing this game and it is different enough from Lost Valley that I did see the need to own both.

I am usually a fan of nither Kramer nor Goldsieber, but I was surprisingly pleased with this one. The theme works very well, and there are both tactical and strategic choice to be made. Medieval Merchants seems as close as Goldsieber will come to ever doing another Lowenhertz sadly, but when they have a good theme which works (Big City, Mississippi Queen, and now Goldland), the games are very solid in my opinion. Pretty slow with 5 players though, 3 or 4 is probably recommended.

We played this 2-player.  There is alot to remember here.  This is not a forgiving game.  If you make a mistake with your planning, it will cost you several turns to correct it.  Our first two games we ran into situations where someone would get themselves to a tile (through an ordeal) that they were unable to ever get out of.  Without backsies, this player would then be stuck for the rest of the game.  We learned to avoid this, but after several games, the play just never came naturally to us.  We really loved the idea of the backpack, dictating both how much you can carry and how far you can go in a turn.  The theme is also great.  However, we just never quite made peace with this game, and traded it away.

Played once with 5, thought it was ok. Seemed like running to the temple was necessary, and whoever quasi-randomly got the most stuff along the way won. It's pretty quick, so I don't mind some randomness, but I don't know how convinced I am that it's not mostly luck...

RATING: 5
Medium weight exploration game with definite puzzle-like aspects to it. Luck of the draw? Yes, for sure, it can make certain paths overly lucrative, and can feed you just the right 'mix' at times, but I don't think it completely hobbles the title. Beautiful production values, I had no idea the tiles would be so large. All of this said, the little tiles that you put into your backpack are fiddly beyond belief, and make the game setup time much longer than I like for games that only last 45 minutes and are on the lighter end of the spectrum. Seems like it would make a wonderful family game, but doesn't really beg me to come back to it and never really draws me in when I'm playing it. I ended up ditching this, just not enough  going on, I feel as though I've seen all it has to offer in my 7 plays. 

Note that this game did feature a wonderful ongoing joke though involving a player throwing pearl necklaces at one of the pumas to avoid being eaten by it. The visual image of the puma wearing the numerous necklaces that random explorers had thrown at it over the years still makes me chuckle, and feel as though the time I spent on this game was a good investment.

One of the "good" euros, and in some ways Kramer's best game.  It's got a nice Indiana Jones/Alan Quatermain sort of theme which I really like but unlike Lost Cities (for example) it actually resembles high adventure.  The anthropology in the game is pretty much limited to shooting restless natives and taking their fishing poles.  You can kill a bunch of animals too.  As a humanitarian and vegetarian, I find that absolutely acceptable in the context of the game and I only wish I could kill more.  There's some fun mechanics here and it has a nice pace that's just about right- it doesn't outstay its welcome or become dull like some exploration games can.  Why the crap Euros stay in print and good ones like Goldland go away is beyond me.

I really, REALLY want to like this game more, but every game I've played boils down to who can race for the finish the fastest.

Components: Great artwork, with only a few difficult-to-distinguish tiles (ravine & canyon) and resources (fishing pole & rifle). Sturdy pieces.

Experience: Interesting game of resource management and developing paths toward the gold, but it has a few too many resource types, so that it became laborious rather than challenging to navigate the board. I enjoy the restriction on movement created by the contents of my backpack.

RATING: 5
Busy exploration game. Players begin on the edge of the board and must work their way in by discovering (revealing) tiles. Tiles may have a cost on them in order to enter them, which is paid for via good solid exploration stuff like ropes, food, rifles, etc. Most of these items are found on the outer edge of the board, but you may find a lake or natives in the interior that enables you to acquire more goods. Then end of the game is triggered when all players have found the temple at the far corner of the board, or when at least one player has found the temple and drained it of money. Points are earned from money found both at the temple and on the board and for entering the most terrains of a particular type (and establishing a camp there). Solid, yet fiddly game.

RATING: 8.5
A fun game with great, simple mechanics that are thematically intuitive.  I really love Kramer's design style.  This rating could go higher but I've only played with 2 so far and think it could be better with more.  There is a possibility of downtime though with too many, maybe 3 might be a good number to try.

RATING: 4
An OK middle-weight game. No direct combat, you can sure do a lot of stuff to mess with your opponents in a race-like way : outdoing them in adventures, arranging newly-discovered tiles in unfriendly fashions, and so on. I'm not so sure there is much deep play or fun here, but there is a lot of fiddling with different bits and a few puzzles to figure out. Traded away my copy long ago.

I think I like Lost Valley better, especially if you modify LV to make the dynamite less powerful. Pretty fun and great theme, but it seems a little one dimensional. Racing to be the first to the gold mine seems to be the only strategy.

Played 1 time. Really not too sure what to make of this. It seems like it would be more fun if it were just a bit lighter. It is on the medium-heavy side. Neat theme, but execution just seems really laborious when it comes to keeping track of all the possible moves and necessary item swaps. (Kind of like playing Bazaar & Carcassone at the same time, only in not such a good way.)

Rating will be revised once I have more games under my belt.  There is plenty to like and a lot of action going on.  Turns go by quickly so no real downtime.  Luck of the draw may be an issue but it can be mitigated by targeted adventuring on the tiles of the perceived leaders.  Many paths to victory and the roads ahead take a fair measure of planning.

Great production - box is really heavy.  Game tends to be a bit of a race to reach the temple and subsequently hog all the bonus gold.  After you've done this it's fairly easy to clean up on the adventure tiles.

Trade interest minor.  Very rare item so I will not part with cheaply.

I really wanted to like this.  A Kramer exploration game with attractive compnents - an instant winner, wrong.  This game is a race game with a pseudo exploration facade.  No real decisions here, it's all react to what is on the face of the flipped tile.  And when I say react I mean you either have the goods, or have to tread back a couple tiles to pick them up.  I just don't find there to be really any game here.

It's a surprisingly strategic game of taking chances with your resources.  I think the key is to explore a lot and use your chips to make up for the lack of resources in your backpack.  As a two-player game, it was a fun race to the temple.

RATING: 8
Really fun game. Not sure if you should focus on heading in direction of treasure, or move around the board picking up the gold pieces. Make sure you keep a shovel in your backpack, since it is one you pick up pretty much only in the beginning. Game lasts awhile and many choices to make, but can only do one or two. Everyone who has played, really has enjoyed it.

This one is hard to rate for me as I expected it to be more than it really is. Now don't get me wrong its a decent game, I just expected more. Although I did only get to play this with 2 players and suspect and hope that it may get better with 4. The components are very nice and the game does have a nice exploration feel to it. Although like I said I need to play it again with 4 for a better conclusion.

*UPDATE* I prefer playing Lost Valley over this, as I feel that game has more of an exploration feel and was more fun to play imo.

I am a sucker for exploration games and especially those with evolving boards. Goldland has gone down well with everyone I have introduced to it. The exploration action keeps everyone interested even during other player's turns since it's fun t see what is going to turn up and what opportunities it may bring. A lovely looking game, easy to teach, length about right. I haven't found the temple gold issue to be a problem - it's a game balancing mechanism and not a game winner/loser in my experience. Recommended.

Very nice little game.  Lots of choices, many paths to get points.  The first time I've played a game with an encumbrance mechanic.  The first playing was with 3, and I think this will be more interesting with 4/5 because of the added interaction.  It was too easy for one person to take the lead in a few adventures and hold them without much competition.  I expect that to change with more players.

RATING: 8
Goldland does a terrific job of evoking its Indiana Jones style of theme, and the gameplay is very good as well.  The board is gradually revealed as you explore, and each turn is like a little tactical logistical puzzle.  You'll repeatedly work out manuevers to get the stuff you need to get past an obstacle or grab a treasure as quickly as possible.  You also would like to explore a new board tile each turn if possible, because doing so gets you tokens that can be cashed in for emergency supplies.  The movement system is what makes the game work.  The less stuff you're hauling around in your backpack, the further you can move without tiring.  In this way, a tension is creating between mobility and preparedness - both of which are extremely important to our intrepid explorers.

We're going on adventure. God knows what will come upon us. So grab your backpack and as you go through the land pack the stuff that looks most useful to you and will help you down the road. 

Now, don't pack too much stuff, or it will be heavy and you won't be able to move as quickly, 'cause the backpack will get heavy. And because this is a race, you want to be first, first to the gold and first to the amulets. But which road will you choose?? Will you survive all the dangers?? Will you prepared?? Choose your road wisely, your instruments carefully and be prepared to change your strategy, as anything can happen on this adventure!

Excellent game!

It was an enjoyable experience the first time I played it, but it left me a little cold, and the winner was evident long before the end. However, I eventually got it in a trade and have come to like it a little more.

The theme works for me and I enjoy the exploration, although the sense of adventure is not very high: just have the right pieces of equipment to get past the dangers. A big part of the scoring is based on majorities in overcoming each type of danger, and there is a significant luck factor in revealing tiles, but not often decisive. And there are just enough movement restrictions to make things interesting, especially with the amount of equipment and treasures in your backpack determining maximum distance.

RATING: 6
Nifty and fun family exploration boardgame.  Players explore the island while challenging the terrain, wildlife, natives, and bandits in an attempt to amass the most gold (and possibly reach the temple, where gold is plentiful).  All adventures are non-confrontational and involve resource trading/management- pearls, food, shovels, rope and other resources are gained on certain spaces, often only after trading one type for another.  Victory points are gained through gold, but also through dominance in any one or more types of "adventures" (like the Longest Road reward in Settlers of Catan).  I like this game because luck is mitigated (no dice).  Also incorporates some interesting mechanics - movement is affected by the number of items you are carrying, which shifts from turn to turn.  This game is definitely more fun with 4-5.  While it's ideal for younger folks, there's plenty of Eurogame here for older players.  Some may dislike the "solitaire" aspect, in that there is no direct interaction between players (although you can affect other player's turns based on your own actions).  There is also potential "analysis paralysis" and subsequent downtimes, so screen your gaming participants carefully :)

A rather light game of exploring and resource management. There&#039;s also a sense of racing which is probably the only interactive element of the game.

A great game that seems to be the perfect mix of Entdecker and Tikal. You're exploring new tiles, like the other two games, and arranging the tiles in such a way to give you the advantage, while screwing-over the other players. Camps are set up, after surviving an adventure, to streamline the movement, similar to Tikal. The play evolves similar to Tikal, and somewhat to Entdecker--you are trying to find your own path to the temple, in order to trigger the game-end clock. Others will do whatever they can to keep up with you, but once the game-end is triggered, it's a mad scramble to collect whatever gold/treasure/adventure is left. It definitely is a Wolfgang Kramer design, through and through--Euro all the way. Play is fast, with relatively few hard decisions to make, other than planning for long-term strategy, and near-term tactical play.

The components are top-notch, and there's plenty of bits, to the point where the game setup is a touch fiddly (like Agricola). It's too bad it is not in English, as this would definitely be popular in the States. However, the rules posted here on BGG by Nick Danger are excellent, plus the rules summary is a definite help. The fact that this is a 5 player design is perfect, as Tikal and Entdecker are 4 player designs (are are most of Kramer's designs). Grab it if it shows up at a on-line retailer--you won't be disappointed.

Update (08/27/09) 3 plays, all 5P: This game rocks. However, the tempo of the game can be determined by the four tiles in the corner near the temple. It can be lightning fast and over in 30 minutes, if everybody goes for the amulets, or it can drag out for 60-90 minutes if the tile placement is difficult. If ordeals are the only way to get to the corner tile, then surviving adventures and gathering treasures may be the way, but one must strike a balance. It seems there are many ways to win--we have just experienced three different types of games. I look forward to many more of this fast, entertaining game. I'm upping it to a '9'.

Update (09/17/09) 3P game in 45 minutes: I think I've hit a trough with this game, losing badly the last several games. My exploration tiles are nasty, while if another player has a good stroke of luck and pulls a string of "easy" tiles (non-adventure), they get to the temple and win off the "annuities", plus the tough adventures they ran into (i.e., the desert and banditos). If the adventure tiles are in close proximity to matched resource generating tiles, then it is a shoe-in. Either that, or I'm just not getting it. Is the game broken in that regard? I'll have to play it several more times to see.

Update (11/13/09) 8 plays: Okay, the game is starting to lose some of its luster. The randomness of the tile draws is starting to annoy me. I'm dropping this down from a '9' to an '8'. 

Update (08/17/10): The game peaked awhile back; not too enthused about bringing this to the table anymore. Downgrading to a '7'.

Update (02/24/11) 11 plays: Surprisingly good even after all this time. Quick enough to play as a 3 player filler while waiting for others to show up, yet meaty enough and entertaining enough for the effort.

This is a very well themed exploration game that really does have the feel of exploration in a Tikal kind of way but a very different game as no area control here.  Comes in around mid-weight with some strategy and some different paths available. There is some luck of the draw here which can make one part of the board a little more lucrative than another and if your not there getting there won't be an option. There are several ways to get points here though so you should be able to compete no matter where you are however a leader that makes it to the gold pile first will be unstoppable if you let that happen. 

Resource management is quite important re the backpack and expenditures. Speaking of the backpack it was really well implemented here with the fuller it got the less you were able to move. I liked the different objectives in the game, part of you wants to race over to gold pile and the other part of you wants to complete adventures and have majorities in them for the scoring. 

Great graphics on great components and the modular board adds to the replay.  Although it is a good game and very well themed the fun factor wasn't as high as I would of liked and player interaction is on the low side, you can affect other players but it is hard to do.  If you want more interaction and slightly more fun you might want to try Lost Valley, if you don't like screwage and prefer something a little more puzzle-like than try this one, both are good games.

Unusual and quirky map discovery game with a highly puzzle-ish feel.  Solid fun and interesting.  The trick to good play is reading what others are doing and keeping up.

I disagree that getting to the temple first is key for victory.  One can win just as easily through a concentrated majorities and treasures strategy, so long as others are splitting the temple gold.

Be sure to read the rules for adventures carefully.  The fine points are easy to miss.

Conveys the exploration theme quite well; flipping tiles without knowing what lies beneath, packing your bags to hopefully overcome those unknown trials. Bogs down a little bit late in the game as you race back and forth to grab the supplies needed to traverse the final tiles between you and El Dorado, but the race of efficiency adds to the tension. Can also get anti-climactic if there's a significant difference in gold when the end game gets triggered, and being too far behind at that point can leave you out of the running.

Nice components and an interesting topic brought this game to the table. The gameplay was ok but not overwhelming. It plays more brainy and less adventurous than you would expect. This will disappoint some people who are playing for the atmosphere. The moves can get fiddly if you do multiple transactions in one single move (change adventure pieces, collect, pass adventures, get prices for that and finally explore).

Compared to other Kramer games this is sub-average for me. I would prefer Hacienda or El Grande most of the time if I'm out for some Eurogame thinking. It might be a less complicated alternative to Tikal. If I want to experience an adventure game (which isn't the niche of Goldland as it is a "Euro") I would rather play "Geschichten aus 1001 Nacht".

Very competitive exploration race game. Its fairly simple to learn, but nothing particularly stands out in the game. Players just try to make the most efficient use of their resources each turn.

Goldland didn't get a chance to shine during my first game: one player started forging a quick route to the temple along one side of the board and in retrospect it's clear that rapidly running to join him was the one thing to do. There may be more here, but it didn't really feel like there was much strategy to it; you convert some resources as you go, see what pops up in the vicinity, and hope nobody else ends up going for the same adventure tokens.

2-5 players. 60 min. Each player has a backpack with room for 12 tools, provisions, trading goods, or treasures. The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.

I forgot to pitch my tent!!! And wound up costing myself about 8 turns as I collected the stuff I needed, then discovered I had no route out to the dig I was planning on exploiting. Because I had forgotten to pitch my tent. Darnit, now I want to play again to erase the memory of that tragic mistake.

Originally I feared whoever got to the temple first would win the game.  But I have seen players who never visited the temple win.  This game has a "puzzle" aspect to it, which can lead to a certain amount of pondering.  However, I found this game moved much better than Kramer's action point games.

Acquired in 2003. Total number of plays = 23. I really enjoy the exploration theme. The number of items limiting your movement range is a neat mechanism that works really well in this game. I really enjoy the early and middle stages of the game. The drawbacks are the rush for the amulets which detracts from the theme, and the endgame is weak. (It does have nice components!)

Interesting exploration game which grants points by digging for treasure, finding the temple and earning gold, or through having the most tents on the different types of adventures.  More of a puzzle game to some degree as you seek to pick up items which will allow you to earn the most points.

Nice exploration game. I like how you collect provisions and items to help you move to the newly revealed areas and can also see what your opponents can or cannot do. The rule book is difficult as it explains tiles and components up front in detail before telling you what you need to do. If you skip past that then it's fine and the setup sheets and worked examples are fine.

I love this game. The exploration is well done as well as the theme. Also it is great fun making your way through all the hazards trying to make it difficult for the other players to follow... I like how you have to plan ahead for the unknown and decide when to take risks (keep advancing or go back and resupply?)

This game is quite fast to play and fun. Not too much direct player interaction, but enough indirect ways of affecting the competition... (placement of the tiles to block paths, stealing the medals...)

Quite cool exploration game.  Same kind of theme as Lost Valley.  The players explore a wilderness and gather things they need to defeat obstacles.  The ultimate goal is the amulets in the temple which yield a gold piece per turn.  You also get gold for defeating obstacles (if you have defeated the most of a type - marked by little tents) and for treasure collected.  Most gold at the end wins.

I highly enjoy the tactical elements present in this game.  I like also that indirectly it is a race game--a race to the far corner of the board.

RATING: 8
Goldland does a great job of creating an exploration theme wherein players are taking their supplies trying to find the best path to the Temple.  Supplies are used to get other supplies (a fishing pole may get you fish) or to tackle obstacles (2 ammos will allow one to defeat & move past the wild cat).  Movement points are determined by how heavy your backpack is, a great mechanism, the more supplies you carry around, the slower you move.  Once somebody reaches the temple the game has a built-in timer and the winner is the explorer who ends up with the most gold.

This game needs to hit the table more often. The game didn't go over as well with my family as hoped but was well received by my game group.  Some obvious similarity to Lost Valley. Both are exploration games in search of gold. Goldland seems easier to teach and play. There are fewer choices to make each turn and perhaps a bit more luck.  I do like the movement mechanic where the more items in your backpack the fewer spaces you can move.

Another one of those "puzzle" kind of games that just don't do anything for me (except give me a headache and make me wish they would just end!). I felt like I was in an old Sierra adventure game - go and get a shovel, use it to find two logs, take the logs to the water to get the fish to get through the desert to.... ughhh. *UPDATE* While preparing it for trade, I decided to give it one more shot since the components were so cool. Amazingly, I enjoyed the game MUCH more this time. I'm not really sure why... maybe I was just in a cranky mood the first time I played. Rating went from a 5 to a 7 showng that it's always a good idea to give games another chance! **UPDATE** A third play confirmed that I really do enjoy this game and I'm glad we have it in our collection.

First impression (4 players): Has been compared to Lost Valley. It really is a very different type game. Goldland is lighter resource management game with exploration theme. You have limited space in your backpack for many different items. The more you carry, the less you're able to move. Items are needed to complete different mission tiles (area majority scoring for different types) that block movement. Other tiles you can use to gain new items if you have requirements for it. Some have treasures that give points. There is a puzzle like feeling in it that I like.

An exploration game with pretty light rules but fairly heavy decisions to make throughout. Feels a little bit like a puzzle at times but with a little luck and the excellent backpack mechanism (where the more you carry the slower you become) this is a enjoyable game. Works well with two players.

Lively Boys Own adventure game which sadly seems to have dated a little faster than its contemporaries. There is still plenty that is worthwhile, but to the critical modern eyes it doesn't feel particularly tense or balanced. It feels a bit of a shame because this is a loving design from one of my favourite designers, but it's by no means a stinker; perhaps just a little less mature than it might have been.

I in the minority on the art. Good build-quality on the components, but I found the artwork rather uninspiring, if not down-right insipid. The supply tokens look like clip-art, and the computer generated canyons and plateaus are just plain cheesy. And don't get me started on gradient-fills. Even the hackneyed art couldn't keep a good theme down though, and the theme in this case fits in very nicely with the game logic. I especially liked the relationship between backpack weight and distance travelled, and the way base camps meshed with exploration. Solid, but not a great game.

While the game seems interesting conceptually, in my half-dozen or so playing, it seems that one player (usually the first) makes a "wall" across the board -- a series of tiles where the paths connect from one side of the board to the opposite and the perpendicular paths all face the same way (whichever side the goal is on). Thus anyone who is on the other side has to either go around or give up four goods to move across a non-path. This player goes on to reach the goal first and collect points each turn while others lag behind.

This game is hard to get a handle on.  The mechanics are simple, but it's difficult to say what a good strategy is.  I've played twice now and though I see some possibilities, I lost handily in my last game and wonder what I could have done differently.  As flipping the tiles involves the luck of the draw, long-term strategies are subject to imploding, and one can be stuck in an impossible situation from which immediate tactics cannot save him.

I suppose it is true of any game that the gamers make the gaming experience.  Usually you hear it with something like Chinatown or Diplomacy.  It is certainly true of this game as well.  With slow boring players this game is a grueling activity.  With fast and upbeat competitors, this is an experience hard to beat.  It does play like a puzzle, but a puzzle that changes and challenges all the time.

RATING: N/A
I have Lost Valley (which isn't the same game but the same theme) and I don't play it enough because it doesn't 'naturally' support 2 players - which is usually the number I play with.

I'd like to add this to my collection because Lost Valley isn't getting to the table as much as I want. (not out of lack of trying!)  And again, I wouldn't be going for this as a Lost Valley replacement as I understand them to be two different games.  It's the exploration / exploitation component that I like so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ok but not as dynamite when compared to Lost Valley simply because the puzzle element of how to effectively improve your score is too chess-like. It doesn't help that the iconongrapy makes the game visually too busy and player's turns are more involved. Also the endgame is anticlimatic when Lost Valley has the uncertain ending and holdings followed by the reveal.

Goldland is a Kramer and Kiesling (K&K) game where you get a single pawn, and you walk him around the board as it's revealed completing challenges and collecting treasures. You lay tiles down as you explore and are rewarded points for having completed the most of each type of challenge, and you get some bonuses for getting to the furthest end of the board first. You beat the challenges by discarding the appropriate gear from your backpack, and you have limited space. In fact, the more stuff you carry, the slower you get moving around the board which is an interesting dynamic. Ultimately, this game was too random due to not knowing what to stockpile vs what tiles would be revealed by other players. This style of game is better executed in both The Cave and Lost Valley: The Yukon Goldrush 1896.

I've read the description of the gameplay and the components and it sounds like a good match. Not too heavy, but not light enough to really be a filler. I've enjoyed most of Kramer's games, especially those he did with a collaborator. I am hoping this will meet with those high standards.

I had been looking to play this game for a long time.  I really like Kramer as a designer and I tend to like exploration games but one play of this guy left a bad taste in my mouth.  I'd probably give it another go if given the opportunity but it felt more like a traveling salesman game than an exploration/adventure game.

RATING: 7
One play, three players.

Screwed up a rule: We collected a discovery token whenever we chose not to perform one action -- you are only supposed to collect one if you completely pass your turn.

As a result, the game made no thematic sense -- you could get whatever item you want by skipping your turn.

This might unfortunately be a good thing since it made the game play *very* fast!

Kind of reminds me of those age-old, text-based computer adventures: open a door, discover what's inside. If it's good, great! If not, curses! Somebody else must be getting the goods!

Taking in consideration Wolfgang Kramer's knack for putting together great games, Goldland was a big, big disappointment.

Everything I love in a game: resource management, exploration, adventure, tile-laying and beautiful components. It's a lot of fun, with plenty of choices and clever mechanisms. There can be a lack of interaction if everyone goes his own way (especially with 2 or 3 players), but I've found it can be advantageous to stick closer to others, just in case they uncover a treasure tile or get dangerously close to the temple. On the other hand, some non-gamers I have played with like the do-your-own-thing approach because it is less cutthroat. The only thing that keeps this game from a higher rating is that the ending can be a little anticlimactic when I'm floundering around no-man's-land watching the gold stash run out.

Like how the "path forward" is unknown, but can be explored to help/hurt others.  Need to plan resources also.  A game where it can pay to cooperate somewhat (follow the trail blazed by others) and also to hinder somewhat.  A nice, quick playing exploration game with a few paths to gain victory points (gold).

Something about this game just doesn't grab me. Being hugely out of position and getting the right tile flipped annoys me. Mostly it just seems nasty for a light game. Like Lost Valley there's a lot of leeching off other players. I get no satisfaction out of winning this. My wife, on the other hand, really enjoys it.

Nice exploration game, in the same vein as [i]Lost Valley[/i], which I like even more because it has a more developed "take advantage of other people's work" element. Besides, the scoring system is too lineal in this one, because it is always the same and you can see in advantage what you are going to get. In this regard, I like also better the luck of the draw of [i]Lost Valley[/i], whick brings over more emotive feelings and fits better with the theme.

Nagyon szépen kidolgozott komponensekkel van teletömve a játék doboza. Egy kicsit a Lost Valley jutott eszembe játék közben, bár annyira talán nincsenek kiélezve a lehetőségeid ebben a játékban. Fölfedezők vagytok, akik a dzsungel mélyébe behatolva egyre több kincset próbáltok összeszedni. Rengeteg veszély leselkedik rátok és figyelni a kell a nyersanyagok helyes kiválasztására. Ötletes, hogy a táska tartalma egyben korlátozza a mozgáspontjaidat. Minél több mindennel tömöd meg a táskád, annál lassabban tudsz haladni. Van benne egy kis többségi rész is, ami akár döntő is lehet a játékvégi pontozásnál. Jó vétel volt.

RATING: 7
Great thematic adventure game with mechanics from here and there. Players use action points (based on how much they carry) to move around a carc-like expanding board. Along the way, they use items in their backpacks to get more items and complete missions (that can be snatched away ala Longest road in Catan).

Once the endgame is triggered (by a player reaching the temple), players have limited turns to get as much treasure as they can. The person with the most gold wins!

The components are well-made and look gorgeous. It's a neat adventure game with a large racing element (players have to keep pace with each other) but I suspect that some input from Michael Kiesling would have made for a better game. As it stands, some actions are processional and isn't really agony inducing as games like Tikal!

A really solid and under-appreciated gem of a game here.  The exploration mechanic is well-done and I like how you get a bonus for discovering tiles, even if other players benefit from what you find.  I also like how the more you carry, the slower that you move.

UPDATE: Pulled this out after not playing for a couple of years, and it has stood the test of time. This really is a great little game, and there's really not much that I know of that's quite like it.

Terrible game. Components are excelent but the game sucks. I played last in a 4 player game and had the feeling that I lost the game on that draw for determining starting player - yes this game is that bad!

Maybe it was my experience but I played last and didn't have many options to play for. I also didn't draw any of those treasury 3VP's tiles. So, everything together and all I got was a lousy hour and a half of a bad game!

I have mixed feelings about this game.  On the one hand the game has a beautiful modular board that makes for a different game each time.  On the other hand, the primary mechanic in the game is strategic pickup & deliver.  Once you figure out the basic strategy (i.e., amass a few items, then travel along using many of them in one turn to get lots of gold) the game doesn't seem that much fun.  I have only played the game once so far, therefore, my rating may improve with later plays.  Overall, however, I am somewhat dissapointed because I was expecting there to be more to the game.

Funny, random but not totaly. This game captures players for its background well recreated and for its easy way to learn.

I like the backpack/movement rule... easy and perfect fitting the theme. Good surprise.

tl;dr: another solid game from Kramer

[person=7][/person] is incredible. He has been designing games for decades, and his games range from good to amazing. Contrast that with [person=2]other designers[/person] who have been doing that for so long. In most cases their later output is... less than we would expect from them. But Kramer, while he hasn't designed a masterpiece in recent years, has been continually putting out very solid designs year after year.
But let's talk about this game. It's one of those games where you have tiles that let you move towards your goal, a bit like [thing=54][/thing] or [thing=31410][/thing]. There is a lot of planning needed for how you manage your resources. You really need to manage them well to be able to progress and score points.
It's a clean design, just like many games from that era (2002) and plays pretty fast. Every now and then you might need to puzzle over your resources a bit longer, but most of the time turns go pretty fast.
All in all a solid design. No where near his best work, but certainly worth playing.

Initial rating 7/10
BGG scale: 7/10

I can't put my finger on why I like it. First time I played, I didn't think I was doing very well while I was playing (but I wasn't watching all the other players) I didn't notice I was in the lead until another player pointed out that I would have won had he not taken some points from me at the end.

Second time I played I made the mistake of driving down a path that I made my "plan" at the beginning of the game. Later I found I didn't have the resources nearby to go down it easily. Something to look for next time.

Goldland may have the most beautiful and evocative artwork of any tile-laying game.  And the tiles are enormous!  That's a great fit for an exploration game, but Goldland is one of the creator's simpler designs.  Much of the game is back-and-forth, from this place to that place, to convert objects into other objects, and hope not to get stuck.  There are some great ideas here, but Kramer used the best ones in other, more compelling titles.  In the meantime, Goldland sure is pretty.

Dig this one. While there is a crazy random element in the tile draw, it works well. You can get blocked into tough spots if you're not careful. Inventory management aspect of the game seems awkward at first, but if you watch the board and where you place your tents you can navigate easy. You also always need to be ready to race to the temple to grab an amulet if someone gets there before you. Solid play.

After 2 plays - Seems as if there is always one player who just ends up getting completely hosed and is out of it by halfway through. Not so much "rich-get-richer" as "poor-get-poorer."

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). An interesting game of exploration, with progressive discovery of the map towards a known goal, and a lot of good ideas (distance moved depending on the encumbrance, final countdown at the temple). The scoring is a bit strange - it is probably the least thematic element in the game, although it is nice that reaching the temple is not necessary to win.

I will concede that Lost Valley is a much more strategic game with a similar theme and mechanic, but I prefer Goldland a bit more due to its accessibility as well as the quick playing time (I feel the former is way too convoluted and rules heavy for its own good).  However, I found the experience to be fairly tedious.  This reminds me a lot of the fetch quests that often plague RPG's in video games.  Gather item X, Y and Z then you can move on, repeat as necessary.  I don't see much replayability here.

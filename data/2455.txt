Funny to own 1 of the Empire Builder games. Especially India is funny because we Western citizens don't know a lot about India in General. Who would know where Hyderabad lies? Who know's how exactly India and Pakistan lie next to each other? The game itself is just another Empire Builder game. Search for Empire Builder how it works. Cool mechanics, though it's a somewhat strange game compared to normal (german) games.

At some point it gets hard to tell the various crayon-rail instances apart. A minor rules issue (the Pilgrims) causes poblems here, but nothing serious - a run-of-the-mill crayon-rails game, in the same bag as British Rails, maybe a bit better than Australian Rails, but not as good as Nippon Rails.

Favors experienced players, leaving newbies struggling to keep up. The new strategies I developed in that first play will probably go to waste, however, since the game dragged on so long my will to subject myself to such a game again is weak.

After playing a few other crayon rail games, I am finding them more attractive and easier to understand. The learning curve on these is tough, but once you get through it the game opens up. Not as elegant as I usually like, but makes for an enjoyable evening.

Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

First play......whew!!! The map takes a LOT of getting used to.  But once we were in the thick of it, we were much more comfortable with it and found it easier to navigate.  This is our first Empire Builder/crayon rails experience.  We played 2-player with the fast rules.  Good thing too, we would not have been able to get anything going without the extra $20 million Rupees!!

Very positive experience, albeit a bit confusing and overwhelming.  Mystery Bob commented on how you have to think and plan a lot--which he LOVES.

I'll withhold my rating for now, but I know it will be high (i.e., over 8 for sure!)

A fairly recent addition to my "crayon rails" collection, but one that has interesting route and delivery options.

This is one of the faster playing crayon-rail games. It has a smaller map that requires you to connect just five cities. The city names and geography do make for a challenge at first, but that is overcome with experience. We find that we can play a two-player game in under two hours.

India Rails is one of the best Mayfair crayon rail games.  Be cautioned, though, that the Indian (and Pakistani and Bangladeshi) city names can be difficult for those not overly familiar with the area.  Many cities have similar-sounding names, for example: Raipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jamshedpur, Nagpur, Kanpur, Gorakhpur, Solapur.  Also some real tongue-twisters like Tiruchchirappalli, Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam.  I actually like this element because it adds atmosphere and provides a geography quiz, but it puts some folks off.

India Rails is the first and so far only of the crayon rail games I played. The idea clearly stems from another era when it was okay that games took a while to play and theme compensated a lower density of decisions. I enjoy playing it with my girlfriend but I wouldn't want to play it with more than three. Especially, I wouldn't want to have optimizers in the game who won't decide before they have calculated the best possible return in all depth as such an attitude will bring crayon rails to a grinding halt. The fast train variant is recommended in any case.

If there's one thing I've learned about crayon rail games, it is that it is a real pain to figure out where to start if you do not know the geography of the board on which you are playing. Get past that, though, and this is might be one of the better games of the series, as the geography seems well-suited.

Most of the games in the Empire Builder line seem to add a feature or two not present in the original. This one adds the ability to get a couple of bucks for picking up pilgrims, which I like. Still, the strongest distinguishing feature for me seems to be the geography.

The scale is smaller than the others in the series, so that the map fits on a 4-panel board instead of the usual 6-panel. This makes things seem unnecessarily cramped, and distances are not as intuitively judged for those of us used to the other boards. The game itself seems fine (I give the others in the series a 10), but the board spoils it for me somewhat. Edit: now that I'm used to the board, I raised rating.

My first crayon rail game. Picked this one because the coating of this board is easy to clean.

Even though there's not much interaction between players I really like this game. Can be a bit long. 

If you're good at logistic planning you'll like these crayon games.

I guess I wouldn't suggest playing this with more than 2,  the expected prolonged playing time will make the game outstay it's welcome.

I hoped that by now I would have learned where all the locations are on the map, but I'm still hopeless. Guess I should have picked up the European or American version... (Update: got Eurorails as well)

NL: Treinspel. Lijkt onaantrekkelijk want het bord is niet heel mooi, het duurt best lang en ik kan niet zo goed uitleggen wat ik er nou leuk uitvind. Speelde het maar met 1 persoon die ik niet meer zie, dus het spel kan wel weg.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Use money to build rails then use your train to make deliveries for money. Connect all the major cities and collect a pile of money to win.

Played as: 2 player (fast play rules)

Pros: I like the connection you create with the game by watching your network grow and moving your train around on it. It's the kind of game you just look at and it makes sense. Has a relaxing feel to it due to its puzzle nature. More games need to be played using crayons. 

Cons: Not really a huge sense of excitement here. Because of that, I felt like it outstayed its welcome despite using the fast play rules. It lacked that something else (interaction?) that makes the game feel like it's evolving instead of just doing the same same for 3+ hours.

Other: It's funny, I never got the same ground level feeling of exploring vast lands as I did in Iron Dragon despite having a pretty good familiarity with India from extensively traveling there. Maybe it's the fantasy that did it for me. Either way, those being the only to crayon rail games I've tried, this was definitely the more institutional of the two. I was looking forward to more simplicity when trying this, but instead missed the variety.

Best Use: When you have the time and want a long relaxing game of efficiency.

It is probably my first and last experience of crayon railroad games (except Funkenschlag 1st edition, that I played about 5 times before 2nd edition came out). It was nice to play it once just for the experience. However, there are very minimal player-interaction here. Too long. Too much luck. Extremely user-unfriendly board and cards. Random event cards.... I felt sometimes a player spent 10 minutes for one turn as he/she got 2 new cards. Then next 10 turns are quite automatic! ha ha ha. No please. I will not play it again ever.

My first and last exposure to the crayon rail games. Tedious is about as kind a word as I can think of to describe this game. The card draws can be so random, favoring some and hosing others - not to mention the event cards, which weren't even a factor in the game I played. Copious downtime, terrible production (why they don't put the places where you can pick up the goods on the cards is just assinine!) and luck of the draw in a 2 to 3 hour game? Not gonna happen again.

The most balanced of all the crayon-rails games. Both the board's layout and the spread of the resources allow players to pursue strategies in fulfilling their contracts. This is one least likely to be affected by the runaway leader syndrome most other crayon-rail games tend to succumb to.

Also, try it with the Nuclear War variant for some silly upping of the stakes.

One of my favorite Crayon Rails games, since there is no overwhelmingly dominant strategy or resource.  As with most games in this series, however, it only really plays well with players who are familiar with the board, goods, and especially the event cards; unfriendly to newbies.

Order of ranking for me: Euro, British, North American, Iron Dragon, Martian, Russian, China, Australian,  Nippon, India, and Lunar.

1998 version has only 4 panels so the board is scaled down from the typical 6 panels.  I don't really like this as much as the other rails games.  The board is smaller (spacing and text size smaller due to 4 panels instead of 6) so its hard to read and some of the terrain colors blend together.  Not much fun to play because of the board.

I have since traded away my 1998 version for the 2005 version.  The 2005 map, while still 4 panels, is much more akin to the other *Rails maps and thus easier to read and play.

Fun! Another great crayon rails game! The map is rather small...cool...and there seems to be a need to build track all the time! It seems like acquiring money and keeping it is tricky...needs more play! We also play with the Nuclear War expansion added; in our first game we only drew one bomb...no carrier! Maybe in a 2-player game we should add the expansion cards to the top percentage of the deck...we shall see in our next game!

"Solid Crayon Rails title, which means it's a great route-building and pickup-and-deliver game, but runs too long with 3p or more. This map is balanced, but has a couple frustrating naming ambiguities, and the dots are a bit compressed." 

What I like: 
- Solid crayon rails on a very balanced map
- Learn some new geography
- The rulebook offers a lot of possible house rules
- Smaller map (4 panels) takes less table space
- Reference info on the map board is fantastic!

What I don't like:
- Dots are about 15% closer together than Russian Rails
- Several city names are very similar to each other
- Several icons for goods look very similar to each other
- The black-and-white goods chits are very plain
- First edition rivers are quite faint so can be missed
- Pilgrims require you to remember where you got them
- Some events expire after "n" turns

Overall, I really like it so far. It will be interesting to see if the balanced map is more fun than Russian Rails, or if it becomes dull more quickly. There are a lot of mountains, so it may get crowded with more people. As with other full crayon rails games, it takes me 60 minutes for a solo game.

The weight is lower than the BGG-voted 2.6. I'll say 2.3.

India Rails is generally billed as a good introduction to the crayon rails genre, and I think I agree.  The map seems pretty balanced, though every player is sure to experience some sort of love/hate relationship with Sri Lanka.  The deliveries seem to be a happy medium between too harsh (Empire Builder) and too swingy (Nippon Rails), and the events are pretty typical with no big surprises.  It is tough to remember where all of the Indian cities are, but that's more a knock on me as an American.  It's not close to being my favorite crayon rail, but India Rails is a good entry in the genre.

One of the better maps for the crayon rail series. With a couple of locations for high priced loads and the locations of the large cities - it seems to be more balanced than other of the series.

I would rate it second to Eurorails.

Very good addition to the series.  Sure, the names are odd to many of us, but you get used to them (or bastardations of them) very quickly.  The smaller board is nice, too.  But, damn, there are a lot of rivers in that country.  If you play with the calamity cards (I always suggest not), it could take quite awhile to play.

India Rails is a great crayon rail game because it's got a tight map, but it's got some interesting features.  For one thing, the Ferry to Sri Lanka is a neat addition.  It's also neat that players can pick up pilgrims for an extra two million.

The only thing that would prevent India Rails from being my top rated crayon rail is that I miss having a circular map (a map that wouldn't make sense for India).  

India Rails is a game that will certainly see more playtime at my house.

One of the better crayon rails.  Despite being the whole Indian subcontinent, the scale seems smaller.

One of the less interesting members of the Empire Builder crayon rail series. The map is small (which is at least good if you want a shorter game) and lacks interesting routing decisions. The only special rule seemed lackluster, an opportunity to pad your runs with "pilgrims" that were worth only $2 on delivery. I like the crayon rail games, but this one didn't impress me.

RATING: 4
As in most pick-up-and-deliver games, there is too little variety, tension and interaction for me. Also, in this case, too much time spent trying to identify and locate towns and goods icons, and waiting for others to complete their turns. I didn't enjoy using the crayons either. 
 I've never played other games in the series.

Good map, but seems strangely scrunched in the north-south direction.  The east-west look just as long but pay off far less.

A little tricky to find places, but a solid game in the series. Requires all major cities to be connected.

A good crayon rail.  The map is a little harder to get used to and the names are hard to pronounce.  Better when played with the Nuclear War expansion.

Best expansion - Pewter trains to replace the markers.

Best extra/variant - Poker chips to replace the money.

Strategy - Indigo in Sri Lanka, rubber in Sri Lanka and jute in Chittagong are the big money items in this game.  Carring extra of these items can be helpful.  Building north to south, Delhi to Madras, is the best start.  Upgrade to a 12 movement train as soon as possible.

I originally purchased this because I have a completist bug trapped in some of my brain cells and I had to get all of the available Empire Builder games.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much both my wife and I enjoyed this.  In a lot of ways, it seems as though everything is much more balanced around the map than in most of these type games.  It seems as though it is less beneficial than in some of the other games to try to stay primarily in one general area.  Unfortunately, you have all of those rivers to deal with.  Despite the inclusion of the Pilgrims, I don't think we've ever actually used them -- it's too much trouble for us to keep up with the regions.  Despite the non-familiar names, my wife likes to play this one.

I played the various crayon rail games when I returned to boardgaming back in 2000.  As I continued to play them, I found myself less interested in playing them.  Is it multiplayer solitaire ... perhaps.  They are okay games, just not great.  I would rather play something else.

RATING: 7
Good addition to the series, with the "pilgrim" run from any region to a big city in another region for a $2 payoff being the small innovation of interest.

RATING: 8
Not a bad rail game.  It's not my favorite of the crayon rail games, but it's definitely not the worst either.  The map is fairly open so players have a wide range of options for building.  Mayfair has done an excellent job of printing most of the relevant information (location of cities and loads) on the map itself which makes playing a lot easier.  Not only would I be willing to play it again, but I find myself eagerly anticipating doing so.

The route-building part is a lot more fun than the pick up and deliver part of the game. Unfortunately the route building part ends before the game so the last 30-60 minutes aren't that good. The game is quite MPS and you will sit looking for destinations and where different types of goods are produced a lot so you'll need to be familiar with Indian geography or become it fast.

{3plays, 2player} Rating after 3 plays with 2: Wow, such a delightful game. It's tough at first to know where the cities are but after 2-3 playings we have found them. The game goes smoothly but there is a lot of planning involved. This game is seeing a lot of play in a very short time! Bonus!

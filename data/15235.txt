GAME: Legends of the Old West
RANK: 4510

RATING: 9
This is a fun game which captures the feel of the Old West pretty well. I've enjoyed every time I played (even when my vicious Cajun trail boss gets shot down by the sheriff!)

Innovative? No! Perhaps too much dice rolling. Why not simplify!?

A fun game? Yes, especially with a lot of people and scenery to cover in or behind.

Neat looking rules...although a little fiddly for a fast game.  Could be wrong, have been before and I am sure that I will again.

Probably the most accesible miniatures game Warhammer Historical (Games Workshop) has produced yet: everyone knows what cowboys, desperados, and law-men are and how much fun it can be to watch 'em fight. As a miniatures combat game, it's pretty fun, with engagements between two sides of 8 or so characters taking about 90 minutes to play out. Nevertheless, keeping track of your posse (team) of characters is quite fiddly and you need to provide (and set up) your own figures and terrain. If you're a miniatures gamer with a taste for the Wild West, THIS is your game!

Very cool skirmish-style tabletop game.
It uses a lot of the rules originally found in GW's Lord of the Rings tabletop game and also borrows its campaign system from GW's Mordheim game, but it works really well for an Old West skirmish game.

Same ruleset as GW's LotR, but for people who like the Old West and have no desire to be Frodo.  Good game.  Excellent tabletop minis "gateway" game.  Why GW doesn't have the sense to promote this more I have no idea.  Perhaps they will when their LotR license runs out.

RATING: 8.5
A (now older) solid skirmish game which thrives when it's played through a campaign. Basically an adaptation to the Lord of the Rings miniatures game. My buddy and I have a lot of fun with this one. Miniatures aren't too hard to find and the game book adds a lot of fun aspects to it as well.

My only real complaint is the Melee. While it keeps the game balanced, charging someone in melee with your fists or a knife during a gunfighter seems a bit awkward and unrealistic.

Pros
-Great Wildwest Skirmish Wargame
-Detailed rulebook full of detailed pictures and info
-Ability to customize your party (posse) how you choose
-Well balanced and fun!

Cons
-Awkward Melee combat system

Rules, point system, history and famous characters, lots of photos, various scenarios and campaign play...very complete and beautiful product. Now there are 3 supplements, all I recommend.
Frontier: Skirmish scenarios, USCavalry vs Indians.
The Alamo: Massed battle rules and background on the Texas Independence.
Showdown: More skirmish scenarios and a campaign.

RATING: 6
Not bad at all, plays fast and simple and it sure is easy to learn and teach others.  Once you pick up the four or five basic things you need to know to move and fight (in the 100 odd paged book) the game is gravy.  The rest of it, ehhhh, it's all fluff.

I really want to play this game once a week.  For awhile I was, but there has been a slow down.  Hopefully, I will get some games in this summer.

Haven't tried this one yet; will get around to it. I do find the Wild West fascinating and I love Games Workshop Skirmish type games. A quick glance reveals many similarities to Mordheim.

The mechanics are based on the LOTR table top game by Games Workshop. In many ways this game plays better than LOTR ( which tends to break down with large model counts ) 

Plays 2+. The strength of this game is the synthesis of all the good elements of the games before it. The game takes from and reshapes elements of Mordheim, Necromunda and LOTR. 

As a 2-player, non-campaign game, the game is okay. There are a wide range of scenarios, including historical scenarios, that make for many enjoyable game sessions. When scratch building a gang 2-play n-c pickup games are fair but there are better skirmish games out there for pickup play ( Warmachine, Hordes, Blood Bowl, DnD minis)

This ruleset doesn't evoke a western feel, but it's lots of fun with easy to learn rules and a great campaign system similar to Mordheim's/Necromunda's.  I'm a big fan of beer and pretzel games, and LOTOW fits the bill nicely.

After joining a demo game, I realized just what I expected from a GW game. Fast-pace mechanics with simple dice-rolling. The factors are slightly boring and basically quite a many rolls need to be high before wounding. Missing saving throws are bad things imho, since now you can just helplessly watch while your forces are being slaughtered.

But fear not, this wasn't all. The rule-system isn't bad, only tolerable. The idea of the game is the unique milieu and the western atmosphere it provides you with. I was amazed of the demo game's western village setting. That was something to remember - and that's what these miniature games are made for!

PArt hollywood, part historical, great fun! Fast paced game with loads of historical info and flavour, but a fast-moving, easy-to-follow game mechanic.

Easy western miniature shootouts. Campaing playing is easily done and gameplay is easy and random enough to have not so serious firefights. Hand to Hand combat leaves something to be desired, but otherwise simple and quite elegant dice rolling system, wich plays fast and is usually fun to play. 3 of 4 player scenarios are easy to arrange too, and work well enough, and you don't need too many miniatures to play. Not the best or most innovative game around for sure, but works anyway, and delievers fun experience. Certainly not a bad choice for miniatures gaming. Turn sequence is good; if you don't get to shoot first, you certainly can look for cover.

RATING: 5.5
This should be a better game. It misses special rules for quickdraws and Hollywood action that the genre should embrace. It's hard to take the fun out of cowboys, but this game manages to do it. I am puzzled how this game rates better than the LOTR Strategy Battle Game on which it is based.

The board game geek I met who introduced me to LOTOW created his own modifier, allowing you to shoot out of range as a "chance" shot, making the game a lot funner in my opinion. However, I like to gang up on an opponent in combat, when playing outlaws vs. lawmen, in a two to one advantage. Us bandits usually end up killing off the posse by bringing a knife to a fist fight.  Things get even more interesting when a zombie apocalypse breaks out.

a SUPERB game, they have taken all of the best bits of the other GW games and made this.
Its greatest strenght and weakness is its theme, if you love westerns great, but there is no magic or demons :D so a bit more limited in variety!

RATING: 5
A little too simplistic for my taste. Books are beautiful with purty pictures but typical GW over-priced. The Savage Worlds role-playing system is a better choice for large shoot-outs and Gutshot gives you more options at the one-on-one level. If you are looking for quick and easy gunfight or have a time constraint this is your game

RATING: 8
A fantastic, fast-paced miniatures game with some light RPG elements thrown in for flavor. The rules are adapted from the Lord of the Rings / Mordheim core, so they're simple to understand, require small-to-medium tables, and most scenarios can be finished in under 90 minutes. Best of all, this game requires very few miniatures, so you and a friend can probably get started for under $30. Some great expansions, too.

warhammer historical mordheim out west game, some intresting tweeks from teh mordheim rules give some flavourful game play, rather forumlaic in some sense and not as free form or flowing as Gutshot (although that's not what it is trying to do) btu still fun especially inf you can organise a full campaign, there are 3 more books avalaible (at time of writing, though have haerd no news to say there will be more) the first blood on the plajns deals with united states armed forces of the period and native americans and introduces rules for playing larger  more battlely games artehr than skirmishes, next came alamo centering (obviously) on teh mexican american war and introduces more detailed rules for large battles and artillery and finally showdown a small release with expanded rules for campaigns each book introduces more posses to play in teh skirmish rules campaigns and are as their parent orgiastiaclly  beautiful books with many articles on tyerrain building, potted histories and opulent photos of acheyingly pretty game table lay outs and painted figures

I played this game with my kids aged 7,4,3 and 3:  3 is too young but the older two found it easy to pick up and fast to play.  The mechanics is probably a bit too simple in a way, but the campaign rules make this game huge fun.  I have figures from foundry, dixon and artisan which are all very nice (especially the artisan ones).  Terrain is cheaply available from "whitewash city" - excellent value!

Same system as Lord of the Rings battle game.  Theme and campaign system go a long way to making this a better game for me.

The worst rules I've ever read but I am in awe of the design. I've devoted more time to FoF than most of the titles in my collection yet I still haven't racked up one true play all the way through. It fascinates me though and I've lost count of the aborted attempts made to play the first scenario. One of these days.....

RATING: 9
Everything everyone says about this game? It's true. This is one time when everybody's right. The game is a genius mess. I've rated it a 6, a 7 and an 8 before--though not necessarily in that order--but after the new rulebook I've got to rate it 9. Fields of Fire can be excruciatingly long, it's hard to learn and it can screw you over with unlucky draws, but there is no other game like it. I've found the best way to play is leave the game set up somewhere and play a turn or three every day, playing a mission over the course of a few nights. All of the bookkeeping and and generating combat results becomes tedious as hell for me after a few turns when trying to play a mission straight through. A single mission can take 5 hours, and sometimes you have to play them more than once if you fail to meet the victory conditions in time. And because of how retrying missions works, you can't really tear the game down and set it back up between attempts, so you better be able to commit to a significant amount of time if you want to get anywhere with even playing a single mission, let alone one of the campaigns.

RATING: 7
The barrier to entry for this title is immense. It is certainly not ASL, as there simply is no comparison to that behemoth, but still -- this is probably as complicated as any game I've seen. Obtuse might be the word for it.

With that said, there is a gem of a solitaire game here. The unfortunate issue is that YOU are going to have to dig hard to find it. IT will not come to you -- YOU must go to IT. This is not easy.

The main problem I have with this title is that revisiting it after any extended absence requires some rigorous retraining -- all over again. It stands saying that as a game designer myself, I have a strong desire to play the game that the designer in this case INTENDED, as opposed to my "winging it" whenever a situation isn't clear. Sure, the "fog of war" argument could be trotted out here, but that's not the point. I don't want to have to interpret what the intent of the designer is... I want their vision codified so that I experience that intent free from distortion.

Thus, I rate it a 6.5, which may be a smidge high for how I feel about it, but I give this the benefit of the doubt. I would really like to see an easier way to get a handle on the intricate rules this game has. I doubt there has been a single game I've played of this that hasn't severely botched one or more rules -- this on the first scenario only.

To be clear: The game is a gem if you can find it after a lot of hard work. It will pay dividends for the effort. This would merit a strong rating, perhaps a 9. Unfortunately, the barrier to entry, need for retraining after any hiatus, and an obtuse ruleset would merit a 3.

We'll see how this unfolds in the future.

Update: Taking time off from this title subjects you to "reinvent the wheel" syndrome. It's almost like having to redo boot camp all over again if it hasn't been on the table in a month or two. That's bad, in my opinion.

:(

Update (2016-March): This is suddenly not so bad. I highly recommend viewing the more recent videos third parties have created with gameplay walkthroughs. It all kind of clicks suddenly. Still need to review rules, but it's making a lot more sense than it used to... and it's a tense game. A lot to like about this. Upping my personal rating of this into the 7s.

Decent solitaire effort concentrated on the chain of command rather than the details of exactly which hex someone is in or which unit they are firing at.

Using "Volume of Fire" to work out how likely a unit is to be hit is a masterstroke, and the rest of the game ties neatly around these concepts (i.e. you never order your own guys to shoot - you just need to get them into the right position to have the effect you hope)

My central criticism is that it is obscenely fiddly. Hundreds of tokens everywhere, tons of charts with constant reference. The fun bits are diluted by hours of tedium.

There is the core of an incredible game here, but it desperately needs "editing". I always think of it fondly, especially the command & control aspect, but when playing a mission I just run into a brick wall of bureaucracy.

This game could get its point across with about half the rules. It would fit better with a digital implementation and I hardly ever feel that way about games. Above all the reason I sold this was that there was too much physical counter fiddling for me. I didn't play enough to give it a numerical rating.

RATING: 6
It's an absolute classic, and probably the best tactical wargame out there. It's a also a fantastic solo wargame, something that remains rare to this day. 
So, why only a middling rating of 6? Well, the rulebook is a mess, even in the second edition. The rules themselves still have holes here and there. This is a game that for me deserves much more, if and when these issues get ironed out. 
The next reprint is scheduled for Q2 of 2017, I await it eagerly.

A developement disaster by GMT. First edition rulebook was a mess. 2nd Edition is 67 pages of rules ! Very difficult to learn. I am an experienced wargamer but I scratched my head for hours to try to understand the rules. Too bad, a missed opportunity for what should have been instead an elegant card-driven solo system. These days, GMT is suffering from a complexity syndrome.

Somewhat interesting mechanics. Unlike any other wargame I've ever seen.
But I couldn't stand the lack of a proper map and traded it away. I think the use of cards to form a battlefield is a nice idea to allow for ever changing scenarios, but it makes the game too abstract.

RATING: 8
Incredibly innovative game on small scale modern infantry combat actions. Whereas in other tactical games you fight, in Fields of Fire you command. The emphasis is completely different from the norm, and the game gains a lot from it.

The game does have one major issue, however. The rulebook could be a lot better: some information is too spread out, hard to find or simply non-existent. While the fact the game is so different explains part of the problem, the truth is the rulebook could be much better organized. I found the examples of play available online to be a lot of help, and I think they're indispensable to anyone trying to learn to play.

All that said, and having only played a couple of missions so far, the investment necessary in learning the rules is well worth it. The game seems brilliant, and I'm rating it an 8 for now, but it will probably go up if the game holds up and the rules don't become too much of an issue.

A very unique approach to wargaming.  I mean there is really some fascinating stuff in this design.  Too bad it's smothered with some of the most incomprehensible rules I have ever seen.  

I sense there's something rich waiting to be discovered by anyone willing to trudge through manual.  I just don't have the strength yet to do it.

The main question:  Is it worth your time if you have a computer?  I suspect solo-wargames are best experienced with a video game.

I so wanted to like this game. Then I tried to play....then tried again....then hopped online to search for answers....there were none, so tried again. Finally after many, many hours of trying to find the fun in this game I gave away my copy. I understand the second edition rules are a vast improvement but I've already wasted so much time on it that I don't want to waste any more time. BTW the designer (Ben Hill) was NOT the problem. He did his job and designed a very unusual game. It was the developer whi screwed the pooch on this one.

This is a top solitaire wargame (easily the best I've played) and despite all the fuss about the rules I found it no more complicated than a lot of other medium to heavy wargames.
It reminds me of when I first bought 'UP Front' and thought "Wow this is different", I think it may be the concepts rather than the rules that people struggle with.

The designer should be applauded for a bold enterprise that illustrates the problems of command and control more than weapon factors but at the same time shows the advantages and limitations of the different weapon systems.

Another very cleverly designed game by Ben Hull...and another game where even the 2nd edition supplies a fairly poorly constructed rule book. It's frustrating that such a good design is hampered by a lot of missing rules and a few poorly worded ones. Also the fact that such a complex game lacks an more extensive Example of Play is near unforgivable.

I want to like this game so much, it has lots of good elements, it has an amazing level of detail and it has moments of high tension. Even the learning curve of the game (so often maligned), I didn't find too bad with the revised rulebook and the good video tutorials on the GMT site. But I just found the game hard work, fiddly, lots of exceptions, and this took away from the experience. So much of the thinking process is about managing the game, making sure I've remembered everything, etc rather than losing myself in the moment of being a commander. I'm sure this will come with time, but it feels a bit of a slog at the moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's an interesting design, but the rules overhead doesn't seem a good fit compared to the complexity. It streamlines play, but offers some simulation bits here and there (phone lines, ammunition, experience ....).

I enjoyed it so far, but I've only played the first WWII scenario.

RATING: 7
The (not so great) rulebook makes learning this game quite a bit of work. The game is also very random (can be a good thing for a solitair game). The "storytelling" is great in this game. If you are not quite experianced each mission can take 4+ hours.
If you play solo and you are not afraid of batteling the rules, you should grab this game. For me it feels a tiny bit too much like work in it´s current state, but maybe this will get better over time.

Interesting unique tactical wargame. Some great ideas are included here. The learning curve is extremely high tough...one of the most complex games I ever played. Often you feel like the rules are a greater challenge than the missions. It also feels a little repetitive after a while and your tactical options are kind of limited, wich leaves not too much room for decisions.

UPDATE: Korea didn't help. I gave up out of boredom after dealing with a couple snipers and a forward observer for an hour. A shame as the game is a brilliant concept, but in practice for me, anyway, it's just boring as hell. For those wondering whether it's worth struggling with the rulebook to discover the game within, my advice would be no. mercenary1963's comment that this is another of GMT's "pay to playtest" games feels very apt. Unfortunately, I don't think the game is close enough that being released for public playtest is going to help, and I doubt we'll ever get the great game this could have been.
---
Let me trim down my previous rant here a bit. Suffice to say, my impressions after playing a few Normandy missions are pretty negative. The pace of the game is simply too slow, and the tactical details too coarse. 75mm recoilless rifles, on-board 60mm mortar support, bazookas, off-board 81mm mortars, it's all pretty much the same. .50-cal HMGs, .30-cal LMGs, squads with assault rifles, they all put out almost exactly the same firepower. Fire (one .50-cal HMG), or (two HMGs), or (two HMGs and two LMGs), or (two .50-cals, 2 LMGs, a 75mm recoilless rifle, a full company of rifleman, and all the company mortars), it's all the same as if you had one .50-cal. I understand what he was trying to get at, but does this really make any sense at all? It seems awfully coarse. I think there just isn't enough nuance to the tactical game, and combat resolution often generates strange results, to make the game of command and control that is layered on top of it all that interesting. And then there are pacing issues; rallying units takes absolutely forever once things get degraded, pinned units slow to a crawl and have a heck of a time accomplishing anything; perhaps realistic, but as a game, having your company pinned down and unable to act for half an hour of card-flipping is not the most compelling gaming experience imaginable.

So. The Normandy games I played were pretty boring, by the end I was dying for the scenario to end after investing like 5 hours in it (one of the great things about solitaire is you can say, OK, the victory conditions don't make any sense, I've taken the objectives, we're done). I'm going to give the game another shot with a Korean War scenario. I so want the game to work, it's a totally brilliant core idea, but honestly I just don't think it does.

1. Design - solid counters, cards too thin IMO. Suggested solution - card sleeves, especially to Action Deck, which discards very often.
2. Mechanics - it's a solitaire game - you act as you, and play as an AI opponent. Few tables, rules are clear, with errata and clarification, no problem at all with flow of the game. Game with three C - Communication, Coordination and Cooperation - don't forget this. Some luck will be nice to see too. 
3. Play - best solitaire low-tactical level game I ever play. It touches field battle in a magnificent way. Bullets are all over, cries of wounded, communication troubles, Higher HQ interventions, very strong and flexible opponent. This game is an excellent self-write AAR's machine :) try it !

This is a VERY complex solitaire game about company-level command and control during WWII, Korea, and Vietnam.  The game is a HUGE time investment to learn the rules, but plays well once the rules are read, re-read, and you have a couple plays under your belt.  Do not believe the 1-2 hour play time.  More like 3-4, even for a person who knows the rules very, very well.  Lots of record keeping.  Lots of card shuffling and card-drawing.  The game is only for the gamer truly, truly interested in a great simulation of command-and-control in a combat situation.  I really love this game, despite it's complexities and other drawbacks.  Will be played often.

09-23-10 - Update.  A way to make this game more tolerable is to play it using the Vassal module.  Eliminates some of the more mundane tasks involved with playing the game.

Takes a week or more to learn (incuding some video watching), takes a hour to set up a but it only takes a few minutes to screw up.   This game requires a lot of investment which it does not feel the need to recipricate.

However I think this game feels like the product of a military college training future company commanders.  Unlike most commercial games it relentlessly keeps its command POV fixed giving you only the appropriate tools.  If you want to meet your objectives you have to deploy the assets under your command, make a broad plan based on your limited knowledge and finally adapt to the evolving battlefield.  Flares and coloured smoke can be as important as another machine gun.

Realistic tactics appear to pay off: 
Find, fix and flank
Deploy your forward observers carefully
Keep a reserve
Evacuate the casualties
Communications are key
Dont be careless with your men
Keep dispersed
Concentrate fire
Expect losses
Focus on your objectives
Bring your superior firepower to bare quickly

This is the nearest thing I have a combat command simulator.  The gamers TCS was great but this unlike that game series is solo game and requires no referee.  Like the real world this not easy and sometimes you simple will not get the breaks.

On a different note the Vietnam scenarios are simply terrifying.  The thought of being dropped into a hornets nest by air and to improvise a parimeter against a enemy in the process of deploying is absolutely hair raising.  In that scenario if you screw up you going to leave a large part of your command in the field dead.  In the conventional scenarios you have the option of pulling your men out of the line or simply advancing more slowly.

This game like no other has increased my appreciation the difficult job the infantry still does in our name all over the world.  It is always worth remembering that this is modeling a citizens army that had many draftees as opposed to volunteers  and in all cases only had a small core of professional warriors.

After getting REALLY tired of waiting 4 years for the P500 reprint, I scored an unpunched 1st edition for a very good price, printed the 2nd Edition rules, set up my first Normandy scenario, got all excited about finally playing.....and then promptly ignored it for a couple of months while I played other games that I already know how to play. Wow, the rules to this game are dense. Thank goodness for the video play-throughs.

Now I have one complete campaign under my belt and a pretty good feel for playing the game. There are some extraordinary aspects to this game, and some other aspects that I don't want to call negative, but I will say that this game will not appeal to everyone.

- The initial learning curve is very steep and makes getting that first game going daunting and slow.

+- Once you get a feel for the game, the concepts are pretty simple, but the level of detail can still lead to a lot of time in the rulebook ensuring that you have it correct....and even then you don't get it all right.

+- Wow, this game is absorbing. It sucks you in for long periods of time. Part of that immersion is due to its very strong theme and requirement to pay close attention to what you are doing in every phase. Part of it is due to the mental commitment (i.e., constantly in the rules and charts) that it takes to play the game correctly. My wife wonders what has happened to me when I disappear upstairs for a turn. The house could burn down around me and I probably wouldn't notice.

+ I really like how linking the scenarios into campaigns discourages you from doing stupid, suicidal, unrealistic things in the last couple of turns in a desperate attempt to reach your objectives (unless you really are desperate). You do need to consider risks to your force, even in the last turn of a scenario, as taking too many losses will impact your next mission. Much of the theme of the game is building the experience level of your company over the course of multiple missions and feeling the sting and setback of taking losses in a mission attempt.

+- I have seen numerous reviews that characterize the game is being focused on command and control instead of tactics, but I'm not sure I agree. Maintaining effective C2 connectivity and having to make decisions about where to prioritize your limited C2 capacity is important, but no more so than in the D-Day series. I find the crux of the game to be very tactical: How can I effectively employ the variety of weapons and units at my disposal? My C2 decisions mostly allow me to employ the tactics that I want/need. I still find that I have too many units sitting around not being very effective. Not because I didn't allocate enough C2 their way, but because I haven't figured out how to effectively employ them. Leader units [Co HQ, XO, 1st Sgt, Plt HQs] are key units, needed to get squads and teams to do something, and I must figure out how to best tactically employ the leaders so as not to get them stuck in situation where they are ineffective or get killed. But I also need to figure out good tactical uses of the squads and teams.

-+ The game is long. Once I'm at least engaged, it takes me a solid hour just to complete one turn. However, the game is good for playing a mission over multiple nights. At the start of a mission, I can easily get through 2-3 turns until my forces start making contact. After that, 1 complete turn is a good evening's work [I can't devote the entire evening to gaming as the kitchen doesn't clean itself and I still need to chase the kids to bed. 45-60 minutes is generally my limit]. The steps between missions to re-constitute your company, plan and setup for either a re-attempt or a new mission also requires some time: one evening to re-constitute, another evening to plan anew and setup.

I'm very impressed with this game and am having great fun playing it. I've also ordered the upcoming upgrade kit on P500 and have printed the new rules for use now.

[b]Aside[/b]: Despite the following 1,900-word comment/rant about the game and occasional disparaging [i]sounding[/i] posts I make out of frustration, FoF is arguably as innovative and brilliant as the wargame I put at the top of the pile, Up Front. Certainly nothing matches it's focus on command and control. As a wargamer of 40+ years I struggled a lot at first but it's slowly permeating into my brain and slowly rising up in my ratings. (And go grab the Commonwealth counters and Italy deck!) Stick with it ... even as you acknowledge that John Butterfield would have made this one of the finest wargames ever designed.

------------

Fields of Fire is the only game I've owned, sold and/or traded away three times, and now have it back in my collection for a [i]forth[/i] time. Why? Well, sit down and grab a drink ... this is going to be a long story. 

It's probably a bloody brilliant game ... actually, I [i]know[/i] it is. Without question it is a game of sheer genius that puts you in the role of a company commander and models command and control like no other game available, and is probably a classic on par with my favourite game of all time, Up Front. Fields of Fire is: Innovative, disruptive, fascinating, with some brilliant things in it. This game would easily rate a "10" ... if it wasn't so damn fiddly, slow, tedious, work-oriented, and mechanically difficult to play. 

And man, does a game take a long time to set up and then to finish or what?

If it only took, for example, 90-120 minutes (instead of five-six hours for scenarios the first several times through ... and not to frighten you, but one persevering lad posted that he'd endured a [i]14 hour[/i] session to finish his first game) to actually set up and play a scenario I'd easily rate it a 9 or 10 and rave like a madman to anyone who'd listen about the merits of this game. Just like Up Front. As it stands, just setting the game set up to start playing can take half an hour. Running through simple examples of play where very little happens (a few units moving and checking Potential Contacts) can take an hour.

But despite it's undeniable shining brilliance ... As it stands now, I personally find it a tedious, numbing, sluggish, counter-laden, fiddly, slow game of having to look almost everything that happens up on dense, scattered, incoherent, poorly designed and laid-out charts; with a rulebook that is missing rules and has no coherent/sensible/logical flow from section to section; and takes far too long to play what it's actually trying to depict. Overall, the pace of the game is way too slow and playing it seems to be a lot of very hard work and not much fun at all for the effort put in, and that's an important metric for me (fun >= effort).

This game is too much work. I worked at learning this game as hard as any wargame I've ever played in 40+ years of wargaming, and it simply was the most effort for the insane amount of tedious/fiddly work it takes to play. Constant rules lookups, looking at poorly organized and scattered tables every few minutes, no flow, no pace, no sense of enjoyment unless you like the slogging granularity and effort required to try to remember everything. Leaving this game a few weeks will mean having to almost start afresh with the rules because the numerous exceptions and missing bits will need relearning every time. This would be OK if the game played in 90 minutes (or 45 of an Up Front firefight) because through more repetitive play you'd learn. But the game takes too long for that with its endless card draws. The pre-prep/set up to play is simply boring to me, and the rules never address how to actually how to [i]play[/i] the game which can be a crushing experience for non-wargamers. In comparison, I never have to look anything up in the rules for Combat Commander or Band of Brothers any more. At all.

As a comparison ... in the time it'll take you to play one scenario the first time, I could actually [i]teach[/i] you Band of Brothers and we could have played three games and gotten a brilliant WW2 story/narrative out of the game. If you knew the basics of Up Front, we could have played as many as six games. I could set up my 10mm miniatures and teach you Arty Conliffe's masterpiece CrossFire and play two games. That's how long this game takes. Even folks who know the rules backwards and forwards still frequently take nearly four hours to play the basic scenarios. For me, that's too long for what the game is, and is simply too draining and not much fun.

As an example of the game's fiddliness ... GMT's own "inside the game" video series for FoF is a two-part video that lasts nearly three hours, without any time included for the actual initial set-up, and is played by someone who knows the game well. But he makes several major mistakes in both parts of the video and brings up one part where the rules are completely blank about when dealing with a common situation. What's telling is this: The game still isn't anywhere near complete after three hours of playing. If that doesn't scream "problematic" game, I don't know what does.

And the volume of fire rules (VOF), as Chris Farrell points out, doesn't model well enough the increased firepower being output by multiple units. Increasingly volume of firepower more likely suppressing a target is factually correct and should be in more tactical level games. But when you can fire three HMGs, three LMGs, and three rifle squads at one target vs. firing only a [i]single[/i] HMG, and the [i]very best[/i] modification to that VOF you could achieve (assuming some crossfire from up to eight adjacent terrains and no concentration of fire order) and there is NO difference in the final VOF firepower rating, then something is clearly wrong. Unless Ben meant it to be not really simultaneously happening in which case he should have said so in the rules and explanations.

As a personal aside, I would've also preferred a more open game set solely in WW2 Normandy allowing me to play Germans and Brits as well, while having Korea and Vietnam be expansions. But I acknowledge the great value in the single unit, multiple theatre narrative this game tries to create, and what Ben is doing with the game.

All this now out of the way ... I should add that the iPad version will be an absolutely immediate buy for me if it (hopefully, please, sweet Bastet!) solves many of the issues (i.e., much faster gameplay by automating much of the drudgery and fiddliness, much like GMT's successfully done with their Dominant Species iOS adaptation; DS on the iPad is now a 45 minute game instead of 3-4 hours) I have with actually playing the masterpiece Fields of Fire seems to be.

Such utter brilliance saddled with such fiddliness and horribly long chart- and counter-laden play ruin this one for me. And I do, do want to love it so much, and to give it that 9 or even the 10 rating it deserves.

[b]Notes[/b]

1. Make sure to get the significantly improved, but still not flawless, 2nd edition rules. They are still excessively jargon-filled and rarely explain things in a sensible order or in simple English (and whoever did the layout knows nothing about orphans, widows, and proper page breaks), but at least are an improvement over what has to be the worst set of rules I've seen in 40+ years of wargaming ... the first edition FoF rules made the Up Front legalese from 1983 seem like a breath of fresh air.

2. Again, awaiting iPad version, which as of March 2013 had a set-back ... it went from alpha (in fall of 2012) right back to "just started" stage again. Maybe in [-]2014[/-] or [-]2015[/-] or 2016 it'll make the transition to iPad. The physical copy simply sits on my shelf, mocking me.

3. Fields of Fire reminds me of Professor M.A.R. Barker's Tékumel: Empire of the Petal Throne RPG in the 1970s. (I'm dating myself.) I'm sure it makes full sense to Ben, like Tékumel did for Barker, but the full experience is lost on so many who attempt to play FoF, sadly.

4. The P500 reprint ([-]late 2014[/-] [-]summer 2015[/-] very [-]late 2015[/-] [-]middle 2016[/-] 3Q [b]2017[/b]) will include yet another rewrite of the rules but it apparently is only a [i]minor[/i] rewrite and will not be a proper full rewrite that is required to make this game understandable. Sadly, the third time is not the charm in this case.

---------------

What I wrote on another forum ...

I had three times, I sold/traded three times. Three completed games, at least four or five starts that I just eventually gave up on. I have the most unusual love/hate relationship with the game. Like a girlfriend you keep dating time and time again despite knowing she's a crazed, hyper-dependant nutter with mood swings that make an 80mph cork-screwing rollercoaster look tame. 

I do think it's a brilliant game, marred horrendously by a disorganized and jargon-laden rulebook (yes, even the 2nd edition) that assumes far too much knowledge from the player, doesn't explain things well enough (it took years to wrap my head around casualties and how you reduce units, it's just so jargon-laden and poorly explained), and is written with no sensible flow and logic to the sections and ideas presented. The game is a slogfest to play due to it's intense fiddliness (enough counters?), planning required to actually start a game, and multiple-multiple-chart-laden slowness. As a UX/UI guy of 20+ years, I think the multiple charts, flow of the game, and scattered/incomplete information are an information nightmare ... resolving what a PC unit is and where it goes on the "board" should take 5-10 seconds. It never does. 

It can also appear too granular (i.e., too many orders) and too abstract (VoF is not weapon-specific enough) at the same time. 

But ... Overall, I think it's a rare gem and as ground-breaking and effective as Up Front (for example), and one I want back when the iOS version comes out (that's the completionist in me talking) ... 

But ... I also dislike how dreadfully long it takes to play a game especially compared to the fun factor it delivers and what it's trying to depict. I want to "simulate" a company level game and the objectives at that level in an hour or two, not feel like I've spent a full day slogging through something. Why can't it flow like a game of Combat Commander? 

If this thing played in two hours from open box to pack up and someone had completely rewritten the rules (again) so that they were on par with the best GMT offered, there'd be nothing stopping me raving. But four to six hours to play even when familiar with it? I don't have that level of time-commitment anymore. I mean, why play FoF when I can get two games of CC in in the same time, or four games of Up Front, or a complete game of No Retreat! or two games of Twilight Struggle? There's also a focus only on the one unit (and in two wars I don't care about nor will play), and the one army, although I know and admire what Ben Hull was trying to accomplish. Overall, not my cuppa. 

And yet ... Here I am very much wanting to find a copy again, so I do acknowledge there's something that draws me to the Normandy portion of it, quite strongly. There are elements in it that make perfect sense ... command and control issues, micro-terrain, etc. And I do find I am playing more wargames solitaire so it does fit. 

Unique? Yes. Brilliant idea? Yup. Flawed execution? Without question. A difficult mistress? Absolutely. I am completely torn by this game; my BGG rating varies depending on my mood from a "2" to a "4" and yet I acknowledge it could be a "10" as well ([i]perhaps at the same damn time??[/i]). 

P.S. The rules need another full, version 3 rewrite. In English. With sensible flow, nothing missing, examples of play, and simplified. But we now know this is not going to be the case, only a bit of minor editing. Bad decision.

I've compared this game to an onion - when you think you've got a grasp of a rule (and it usually will be spread out among three or four parts of the rulebook), you'll find out that you missed a word and got it wrong. That said, it's also like an onion in that there are many levels to play and I mean that in a good way. I urge people to find someone to teach it to them rather than try to learn it on their own, as even the example that GMT has put up (as of 12/08) is not sufficient to even begin to get the various complexities across. The rulebook itself is nearly useless, having *two* examples in the entire book. It's a bit like learning how to build a car by learning how all of the various subsystems work and an out of focus crayon drawing that tells you how to put it all together. Other than that, a very good solitaire game that will demonstrate the importance of planning and communications like no other wargame will.

The rulebook is rather ambiguous in some places, and the game itself is fiddly. As a result, it's definitely not a game for everyone, but for me, it's one of the best solitaire games I've played.

The game creates a strong narrative as your command your company around, and I always find myself looking forward to playing the next mission.

Be aware that the focus of the game is on command issues.  If you are looking for a game that you can quickly sit down and start pushing counters around, this is NOT it.  If you're looking for a game that gives you a feel for the kinds of things a real company commander had to worry about, on the other hand, this IS it.

Such a great idea and probably a great game. But, after reading the rules multiple times and watching video walkthroughs, I wasn't even able to get through the first scenario without getting stuck with a rules question (re: placement of enemy units off map). 

I'd rather this just be a computer game to handle all the charts and stuff.

Love how command and control is handled though. Very realistic and proper in that it flows down the chain of command to the squad level.

RATING: 3
Solo game where the player is a US company commander from WWII, Korea or Vietnam.  The game is played in mission format, which can be standalone or linked into a campaign.  Game play is order based along a chain of command, from regiment/battalion down to platoon, with around 60 orders possible.  The game is  played on a setup of random terrain cards, with randomly generated and moving enemies, so there is plenty of variety.  Combat is abstracted into primary weapon type and direction - you don't factor count here, just try to achieve fire superiority and keep moving.  Interesting game let down by a truly poor set of rules - typos and poorly explained, with barely an example to be found (i.e. good design, bad development/production).  Frankly, GMT should be ashamed of themselves for letting this one out the door.

This game is a big beautiful unplayable mess.  I love everything that FoF tries to do and Ben Hull should be credited for trying something really creative and interesting with wargames.  However, the level of abstraction along with the sheer amount of weight the game puts on the player is almost unbearable.  I've tried to play this game many times but the rules issues keep it from playing smoothly.  I really do admire what was attempted here, however, and I will follow Ben's future endeavors with great interest.

Once you get a little used to playing it it moves much better. To start out tho is a bit tough, lots of referring to rules, BGG, etc. Before I received it I thought I had a good idea about it from all the posts and videos, which turns out helped a lot, but trying to find where stuff is (ie- charts) is tough and I still spend lots of time trying to sort it out. That being said, it is a REALLY interesting game and I really like it, even if it doesn't fit into the box. Admit I can't wait for that super helpful player aid someone is going to make... I hope.

FoF achieves at what it sets out to do and what it sets out to do is unique. On that alone I really like the game. An abstraction of a commanders battle map as a living, changing representation of a battle being fought elsewhere by soldiers removed from HQ is a really innovative idea. Most games are typically trying to attempt to more closely simulate the battle itself. FoF turns that on its head and gives you a strategic experience like an officer might experience it from their heated and cooled tent. Tactics are completely abstracted on the ground and it works. In addition to the successful exploration of the theme is a real gem of a solo rules set. You will definitely be thinking of ways to adapt the system to other non-solo games. A lot of press has been given to the opaque rules. It is rather disjointed and lacks examples of play. I choose to cut the designer some slack. An awful lot of work went into the mechs of solo play. Pair that with a deadline and I think one can understand the choices the designer made regarding the focus of his writing. As a solo this game is very strong and I woud recommend it to anyone who wants more war gaming in their life but can't get friends to cooperate.

The game is grand when it is doing what it does best-driving a strong, tense narrative of the trials of a company commander when everything goes wrong. There's a lot of interesting decisions to be made 

The problem is that the constant rules lawyering you have to do to yourself (even after 20-25 hours of play due to the fact that the game seems to operate in one-off exceptions to the rules as much as it does the "base" rules itself. This drives up the playtime per mission by a substantial amount, and it's not uncommon for me to hit 3-4 hours per mission, at which point I'm burnt out and just want the mission over with.

I don't find the rulebook all that flawed, but the game just seems to me that it's tries to cover too much and its rules just collapse on itself.

I still play it from time to time anyway, and still think of it a good game. It's not something that I'd wholeheartedly recommend though.

This is a unique game. Not only is it solitaire, it is a very dynamic solitaire. Not only is it tactical, it is a completely different type of tactical about commanding rather than controlling units. The rules are a mess, it is a bear. In the end, Fields of Fire still creates a narrative that often impresses. It creates games that are memorable. Remember when you told all your friends about the amazing adventure you had during your pen and paper RPG session when you were in middle school and they looked at you funny, wondering why you were telling them? This game makes me want to tell the same stories to people about the crazy situations my company has gotten into and out of.  

Long and difficult, though.  It is fiddly as hell and at times hard to play but the narrative can really shine when it works.  That's what is keeping it from a 8-10.

I've had a couple of test runs on the 1st mission, and I have to say that this is a truly innovative game. My only beef with it is that the rules are way too ambiguous and fail to adequately cover all the situations.

Unfortunately, I'm in the camp that likes my rules tight, and I'm not really the sort to "adapt" the rules to the game, so I'm really eagerly awaiting the rules rewrite.

There really is nothing else quite like this game out there though!

Rules could be improved - worth it once you've plowed through.  The hard part is this game does not follow the traditional approach and the idea of expending command points to do everything and not having "total control" may not be comfortable to some players.  My big gripe is that LOS has to be traced only along straight lines or straight diagonals.  I guess it keeps things simpler, but it does jog my sense of reality.

Only played the 2nd edition.  It has several issues with it that are in dire need of an errata, which GMT did provide, but this is something that really shouldn't have happened with a 2nd edition version of the game.  That's the edition where any errors should be fixed from the previous version and be kept minimal.  So if you get a copy of this game, first or second edition, be sure to check the errata and correct the errors they made before playing.  It helps with some confusion on the Campaigns/Missions too.

That being said, once you learn how to play and get past the errors, this game is quite engaging.  You are forced to think, to make potential sacrifices, make the hard decisions, in order to win.  Difficult, in a good way.  If you become skilled enough to take on an entire campaign, my hat is off to you.  The missions alone are difficult enough to beat, never mind an entire Campaign.

It takes a good amount of effort to learn to play this game, but once you learn it and know a good portion of the little details/exceptions, it plays quite well.  Only real downside is attempting to keep track of everything (and remembering to keep track of everything, especially ammo count), and requiring pencil and paper for note-taking.  Getting absorbed into the details helps.

After about 6 hours of hard work (and I mean work) with manual(s), player aid(s) and counters (many counters) I begun to understand the huge amount of knowledge and love the designer put in this solitaire. I'm looking forward to have the necessary playtime it deserves.

Good solo game engine. I enjoy every play, even with when muddling through rules. My only concern is that I don't always have the stamina to enjoy to the end, due to the combination of intensity and game length. Other game in my collection that are just as long don't seem to have the same intensity as FoF. Great narrative in this one!!

Update (December 2017)
Played some more games with the update kit. There are still questions which arise and which are not answered in the rules. Even some basic concepts are still not properly described or scattered over the whole rulebook. There are much more illustrations but still not enough. The Extended Example of Play in Briefing Booklet 2 is much less extended than you might expect reading the title. Only 2 turns. Internet connection is still a must. At the GMT website you can find a playthrough document. Unfortunately there is only a Part 1 and not up to date (e.g. use of commands which has changed). Rules: 2 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3): Fun/Replayability: 3 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

Update (October 2013):
Played 7 games with the second edition rules. Much less questions but there are still substantial ones left. Fun is definitely rising. Rules: 1 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Fun/Replayability: 3 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

First impression (March 2010):
Great concept and I was very exited getting the game because I was for a very short time a play tester until I got mentally ill (not because of the game). What I see now is concussive. Rules are laid out in a catastrophic way with virtually no useful examples of play. Internet connection is a must. I have stopped playing the game until the new rules edition comes out because I am really tired of constantly reading in the forums with many contradictory answers except from a few experts. Even the counters are not as they should be. Once they are punched out you have much pain to distinguish the Korean and Vietnam counters. And there are many errata counters. I am disappointed with this GMT development. For clarification: I have some very complex games like Carrier and Tokyo Express and I understood them right out of the box. My rating will definitely rise when there are clear rules and at least one full game example with all aspects which could arise. Rules: 1 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Replayability/Fun: 1 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

People who admit in the comments that they never learned how to play should have their rating removed.  Seriously, rate the game once you figure it out.  If you do not have the patience or ability to learn how to play, don't nuke the game for it.  Go complain to the designer/developer.  The rulebook is a mess, but that shouldn't effect your rating of the game.

Rant over!  This is a really unique and interesting command-based solitaire wargame.  The terrain system and bad guy AI is very good and produces a replayable, realistic game.  I have only played the WWII missions, but I am guessing it gets even better with Korea and Vietnam.  

My only gripes about the game are the lack of differentiation between the weapon types and the lack of an "intro" mission to teach the basic concepts of the game.

RATING: 8.5
Tactical wargames have been a tough sell for me solitaire as it's hard to make an AI opponent feel real without a fall-through command list (which has never really appealed to me). Fields of Fire however takes a more abstracted approach. Hexes are generalized into cards, and firing is generalized from individual actions into volume of fire into a general location. What this does is allow for other more unusual mechanics to make their way into the game such as communication lines and command groups. It's a genius system.

The rulebook is an unfortunate bear, and the example play is riddled with errata. It will take me a lot more time to get over the rules hump to where play is intuitive, but the game has me hooked with its interesting systems and play. It can play relatively fast too which is a major plus. Solid, solid game with great payoff

After a couple of starts and stops, I finally decided to try this one again.  Really wanted to like it, but it was so different than any other game I had tried.

In a nutshell, now that the 2nd edition rules are here this is a great game.  Card deck to set terrain that changes with almost every mission, three campaigns covering WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, and enough chrome to keep you guessing.

My only "complaint", and let me say that I am not saying the game design doesn't work, is that there are times when you can't clear a card no matter what you bring to bear on it.  I had a German LMG team in the woods on a card and after 6 turns it was still there :(  Artillery, bazookas, and finally hand-to-hand with grenades still did nothing but pin it.  It finally ran out of ammunition and then ran away.  There are times when you would think that the shear volume of fire and force with which you are bringing on an enemy would overcome it (assuming it isn't in a concrete missile silo of course).

Other than that, you should really try this on out.  The campaign keeps you involved and the game flow will grow on you.  Great work by GMT and Ben Hull.  The support is on-going and very good and the future growth looks wide open too.  Please bring on Peleliu.

One of the most immersive games I've ever played, you feel like you're in the battle with your men. The narrative that this game generates is a lot like another legendary game, B-17: Queen of the Skies, but this game is way more interactive with a zillion decisions to make and the minutia is astounding in its execution.

This is like being in an episode of Combat!, and you're Lt. Hanley, Sgt. Saunders, "Caje", Kirby, "Littlejohn" and the rest of the squad, all rolled into one.

This is simply one of my favourite games, regardless of genres, of all time. I can't wait until Volume II, that features the 5th Marines, goes to the printer in 2018!

RATING: 10
Awesome in condensing so much stuff into a smallish cardboard box.  The breadth of decision-taking is immense and it will take many, many plays for me to become proficient at figuring out what to do next.  I hope the obvious expansion potential of this game is realised with different units and conflicts (a modern, more urban environment would be amazing).

There are the usual GMT glitches: some amazing typos in the rule book and missing cards in my box.  I think the rules are fine, but are in serious need of some cross-referencing and an index.  The layout is unintuitive, but the play-aids help.  The art is superb and graphically the package is very nice.  I've found the examples of play posted here and on CSW to be helpful, although they are also error-strewn.

Actually, since FoF is my most recent GMT purchase, I'll use this comment box to mount a general rant at their quality control.  FoF has just caused me to cancel my P500 for Labyrinth because what I've realised is that GMT games do have an amazing propensity to contain pretty amazing typos.  So far, in my experience, for unacceptable typos we have Twilight Struggle (fortunately I jumped on this bandwagon late and got the second edition, which contains fewer mistakes than the 1st or deluxe editions), Blackbeard (both the map and rule book), Conquest of Paradise (missing a great chunk of text in the playbook) and now FoF (underdeveloped rule book and, again, pretty bad typos making it unpleasant to read).  OTOH, the Combat Commander material is pretty much perfect, and anything by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood is very, very good (Elusive Victory still contains a lot of typos though).  What this tells me is that, essentially, GMT does very little of its own quality control and relies upon developers and designers.  So I'd be pretty much happy to P500 anything by Chad Jensen or Lee B-W, because they have high standards, but for anything else I'd be very wary.  Hence cancelling my P500 for Labyrinth.

Best/favourite/most played 1 player game

After playing a lot of solitaire games (and I include all kind of solitaire games, not just wargames); FoF it's the best solitaire game I ever played IMHO. 
Furthermore, with it's flaws and strengths, it's one of the best tactical wargames that I've played (solitaire or not).

The struggle with the rulebook make this game a 9. Once you past that, the game flows rapidly and makes a great narrative through simulation. An unpolished gem

--edit--
The 2nd edition its a disaster! Not only doesn't fix knew issues, it adds even more! A completly utterly fail. This game needs a *reliable* developer.

I can finally rate this, after owning it for so long and trying every now and then to get it on the table. From what I thought I knew, I had a good feeling I was going to like this. But the rules (even 2nd ed.) can use some serious work. However, the journey was totally worth it, even if I might still get some things wrong, because this design is an awesome single player gaming experience and I can't wait to find time to go at it again.

Seems like an interesting and realisitic simulation of company level wargame.  Ben Hull is renowed for designing good solo wargame that is unexpectedly exciting and fun.  The rules, however, are terribly written as some claimed.  As it features US Infantry in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, I hope GMT can release the same for German units.  That would be much more appealing to me. 

The game is an attempt to resolve company commander's tactical problems in actual battlefiled. The solutions, as one said, resemble the field manuals.  This reminds me of a U.S. army field guide that I bought before but sold for good later.  Is there a best solution for any particular situation?  Would it be too limited in your choice of actions?  Does it too resemble Up Front?  If so, how does it compare to Combat Commander, which is already a very popular system itself on the same level of tactical simulation.   

I am suprised by the large no. of ratings given here and never thought of it as being popular as it could be now.  Ben Hull may be the reason why as he designed Victory at Midway (also a solitaire game) which received very well comments from the wargamers.  This game might be a good mental and brain power exercise but I would have been much more interested if the subject battalion would have been a German one, e.g. German invasion of Russia in WW2.  As of now, I would wait until a more streamlined rulebook can be around.

Looking for the second edition by GMT.  I think there is a game here. If the new edition can remove the unnecessary typos, more examples of play and AAR like that in Stalin's War, it would be very much helpful to let this game out and be played over and over.  After all, it is a solitaire design and naturally has an advantage to many wargamers these days for when opponent and time are both limited.

After a dozen setups and about three plays I'm enjoying the game, but it took quite the bit of puzzling through the rules and reading of other people's session reports.  A better set of rules and extensive play examples should have been included.  That said, this is quite the innovative game that really seems to require careful command decisions and attention to the kind of detail not found elsewhere.  Care must, primarily, be taken to maintain lines of communication.  Otherwise, all your careful plans fall apart.

What I have read on this fascinates me.  I have not really got into a solitaire specific game for some decades, but I thought this might work for me - so I pre-ordered the second edition in June 2012.  Five years on it finally arrived.

Maori Wars still holds the record for longest time between pre-order and publication, but five years was a pretty good attempt.

After one play through this has maintained my interest.  Took forever to get into the rhythm of the game - because it is very different to any other game I have played - but now I am starting to think more about how to solve the tactical problems it presents, and less about the rules.

I enjoy getting to that point in a new game system, so I am enjoying this so far.

RATING: 8
Entry for all Fields of Fire games:
+ Volume 1 (second edition, May 2017)
+ Volume 2 (late 2017, preordered)

Fantastic system once you understand the relatively simple basic rules. Alas, the system has yet to be described in a succinct way.  My advice: Don't concern yourself with getting every rule exactly right. Learn the overall design and then just have fun with the system. Accept that your first few games may not adhere exactly to the designer's intentions. In the end, it doesn't matter that much if you actually ran out of ammo or were not in communication. You can add those rules later.

The system is very solid. A few missteps by the player will not invalidate your experience. Eventually, you will get it all down, and when you do, games play very quickly with a lot of replay value. I can't wait for expansions.

FoF is turning into the perfect compliment to ASL. ASL is a tense two-player test of skill. FoF is a solitaire test of will. 

While both games model squad-based combat, ASL admittedly fails to model several key elements of combat: the command structure, battlefield communications, and lines of attack. It is precisely these essential characteristics that FoF emphasizes. Because most (FoF designer Ben Hull's Musket and Pike Battle Series is another exception) squad-based comsims neglect command, control, communications and intelligence (C3i), FoF feels like a very strange game. This strangeness (along with sloppy rules writing) is the major cause for players' difficulty comprehending the gameplay. 

Why should I have to activate the CO HQ and then activate the First Platoon HQ in order to get the 1/1 squad to move forward and seek cover? Because in FoF, you are playing the role of the company commander. No CO HQ wants his platoons and squads acting independently unless they are under extreme conditions. When an enemy MG nest is found on the right wing of command, the HQ must reassess the situation and move assets into proper position. The HQ in FoF does not have full knowledge of the battlefield until his subordinates report this information back to him. How would the forward 3/2 squad know if it's safe to evacuate casualties? Perhaps the evac site is under fire. The order MUST come down from HQ. 

Sure, squads will open fire against a spotted enemy that is firing on them, but they will exhibit little other initiative. In actual combat, squads running across a battlefield on their own initiative are unlikely to survive to the next mission. Squads out of communication with their platoon leader and ultimately the company commander are asking for trouble.

FoF also succeeds in making volume of fire and visibility the primary factors for determining the effect of fire on a unit. The simple tracking of VoF provides the feeling of a realtime combat without the complexity of ASL's interwoven phases. Armed with enough ammunition, even green troops can lay down a steady volume of fire, though veterans will have a much easier time concentrating their fire on a target. Soldiers in the open being hit from multiple directions are going to suffer no matter their mettle.

RATING: 7
Many solitaire games feel like a poor substitute for face-to-face gaming.  Not so with Fields of Fire--a game of FoF is as satisfying as playing a really good multi-player game.

Fields of Fire is a very engaging game, and as others have said it tells a story.  The VOF/PDF system makes a lot of sense once you see it in action.

While more examples of play (and the proper way to manage the mission log!) would definitely be appreciated, I think the concerns about the rules are somewhat overblown.  After my first game I had a long, long list of questions.  After carefully rereading the rules, I found that all but one were answered to my satisfaction.  The designer and GMT are supporting the game well here, on CSW, and on GMT's site.

If you're on the fence about getting the game because of the rules, take the plunge!  It needs some study, but you'll be getting a great game.

Rating falls from a 9 to a 7 because I just don't play it that often.  I really like the system, but if I haven't played it in a while the barrier to relearning it is high.  The length keeps it from hitting the table more often too, but that's more a fault of my job rather than a fault in the game.  I have hopes of someday having time enough to play this more regularly.

What a mess this rulebook is. And I am talking about the 2nd edition "improved" rulebook.
I think it is possible for me to learn this game but I do not feel convinced that the 30-40 hours of work is worth it.
Are there interesting decisions to take in the game? It seems to be about learning best practice and then play that. That would mean that once I learned the game I would not want to play it.
Also the maps seems oddly coarse. A 4 x 3 card map means I can not really flank the enemy. Does it even matter if I do so? Maybe, but as said, it would take me a full week of work to learn the game enough to know.

Wow, I think I understand the game now!  Took me three 5 hour plus sessions to get the grasp, but now I think I can play a whole scenario through.  Very excited about this!  So many decisions to make.  Not sure how to use the Sergeant and the XO yet, but hope it will become clear as I play.

Jan '18:  Having another go.  Think I understand the basics again, but no vehicles yet. Mwant to try the campaign.  The communications are really difficult for me to master, so I may neglect them to start off with.  The tension is superb, though, especially when you hit that machine gun nest and all hell breaks loose.

What appeals to me about Fields Of Fire most is the dynamic and modular playing field. I like not knowing what I'm going to face when I go into a mission. The rules are still a challenge, but I think I'm going to stop obsessing about small rules and just go with the flow. I'm still undecided as to whether this is a great solitaire game, but I'm going to give it some more attempts soon.

The third scenario of the WWII campaign was not very exciting at all. The poorly-written rules are very distracting from the game. The overall mechanics, while inventive for a solitaire game, are somewhat lacking in ease of play. I keep hoping for a solitaire game that is as interesting as a two-player game that I do solo. No joy so far. I think the last four solitaire games I've owned (Field Commander: Rommel, B-29, Silent War, and this one) have turned me off of this type of game.

Obvioulsy need to explore this one much, much more, but my first few plays were sooo much fun. Very intense gameplay.

Edit: Tried to start a campaign and just can't enough clarity on the rules to make it fully enjoyable. I love the system and I wish I could get the rules down pat, but there's always another rules question to look up. Plus the bookeeping really drags it down for me.

RATING: 3
A game in search of a usable rulebook. I owned it and later traded it - this was back when there were virtually no additional help aids here on the geek. I may look into it again, but I've also perused some of the help videos (still pretty confusing) and it seemed kinda fiddly and book-keepy. What's worse, it seemed like the kind of game that even once you know enough to start playing will have you glued to the rulebook for many, many sessions. Truth be told I turned off the video and thought - jeez, this looks about as fun as doing my taxes.

That said, the promise of this game is undeniable. The people who "get it" describe a deeply rich, unique, and gratifying experience. I'm just not sure I'll ever have the time/inclination to break through the infuriatingly obtuse rules - especially when I really should be working on my taxes.

If any non-grognards are ever able to crack this nut, I'd love to hear how they got there and if it was worth it. For now, I'll stick with Mage Knight as my epic solitaire game of choice.

RATING: 7
A solitaire game of company/squad level combat in WW2, Korea and Vietnam. The rulebook has been criticised for its impenetrability, but I think this is more to do with lack of examples and the fact that the game introduces a few novel concepts that many wargamers will find difficult to grasp at first. After reading the rulebook a few times, downloading the example of play from GMT website and playing a few missions the game really grabbed my imagination to the point of obsession. Like GMT's Combat Commander FoF has a really strong narrative element and thrilling game play. Once you get the handle of the command and control rules and the concepts of Volume of Fire (VOF) and Primary Direction of Fire (PDF) you can really immerse yourself in making 'real-life' tactical decisions as you try to complete your mission objective in the face of randomly (yet realistic) enemy activity. I think we may have a new sub-genre of wargame here - Card Driven Solitaire Game. Overall, a great game (with flawed rulebook) that's not for the feint-hearted or casual gamer, but one that will provide endless hours of fun to the committed.

I have little doubt that this is a great and highly innovative game.  Unfortunately it required too great a time commitment from my addled brain to figure it out.  Perhaps if I ever retire...

UPDATE: Videos now available on YouTube (thank you Chris Hobbs) make this FAR more approachable.  With just one sitting through those videos and a bit of rulebook reference I cruised through my first game and enjoyed it immensely.  While some of the concepts take getting used to, it really is immersive in terms of the commander's narrative.  I'm hopeful the second edition rulebook will allow others to jump in faster than the first did.  In either case, check out the YouTube videos before you do anything else. :)

Interesting concept--following the 9th Infantry from WWII, through Korea and into Vietnam.  Unfortunately, the game is not as intuitive as it should be and suffers from some vague rules.  However, given the limited offering for tactical Vietnam ground actions (ala Squad Leader or Combat Commander series), especially solo-play--this is well worth the effort.

Frankly, this game has all the appeal of root canal without novocaine.  The rules are horrible and provide little insight as to how to play, the data is displayed in massive chunks with little explanation, there is excessive jargon (to little point), and too much fiddliness. GMT posted an example of play, which is about the only way you can even attempt to wade your way through this morass and even that is quite limited. The example involves moving exactly two units forward one card each, with very little combat involved.  To do this requires the draw of 28 cards (each of which is packed with data and symbols and each requiring table lookups) that took almost an hour (and that was with things explained)!  If I'm going to work this hard, I want to get paid for it.  

The rules are being reworked and a new example of play is planned.  I would avoid this game like the plague until these are published (and then I would proceed with caution).  There is allegedly a novel p.o.v in this game.  The problem is, unless you're a masochist, you'll be bored stiff before you ever reach the point of finding it.

worths. I have just one complain.The luck is the drive of the game. You could have a quite walk to the Objective or find an impossible way covered of mine fields and MG nests. You need many tries to complete the mission..your strategy is really less important than the luck of drawing the right card in the A B C encounters.If you consider that the great part of the mission request you to clear all the rows it's not possible to avoid a double or triple card with an heavy defence to win. This make the game really difficult.

Fiddly, but not nearly as fiddly as ASL, and the fog of war built into the design is worth the effort. That such an innovative system is built around a solitaire core makes it that much better. 

I think best way to approach FoF (well, after skimming the rules and watching the videos and then actually reading the rules) is to remember that it doesn't game what most wargames game.

It isn't mainly about maneuvering your units or about firing with them (they actually fire on their own); it's about allocating orders and keeping in communication. It focuses on precisely those aspects of infantry command that most traditional wargames abstract out of existence. If some of the things that other wargames cover in detail are more abstracted here, that's part of the design. Those are things the squad leaders worry about, and you're the company commander.

Despite the unclear rules and muddy counters (for which I have marked the game down a half-point), there looks to be an excellent simulation in here that maps strongly to real-world decision making and generates believable narratives. This is a company commander's tactical problem and the solutions resemble the field manuals. This is very much a game for the serious student of infantry combat and is a candidate for best in its class of tactical games. 

Player workload is much lower than the reams of tables suggest. Sessions of 4-5 hours look to be common. And the 'random map' nature of the terrain cards offers a lot of replay value. The campaigns add to the game's longevity.

However, the solo gameplay, the focus on American-only actions and the slightly puzzle-like nature of play may put off gamers who may prefer the more freewheeling ASL and its clones, or desire to play the Herrenvolk. This is the sort of game that will attract a cadre of evangelists, drawn by the simulation fidelity. If you are tired of the cartoon infantry antics of Squad Leader, this is a welcome and refreshing antidote. I am very impressed by it.

The best solitaire game I've played, without question. After a few plays through the first mission dogged by uncertainty with my play, I decided to shelve it until GMT released a bit more documentation. Now that I've read through the new XoP, I think I had it all just about right, and I'm really enjoying playing it. Likely climbing to a 9 after a few more missions - after all, I've been thinking about it daily while too busy to play it. 

Also, this is without a doubt the best supported game on BGG. Thanks to Ricky for his invaluable help answering questions.

Pros: very novel command system, difficult tactical decisions, lots of counters to clip.

Cons: rules, a fair amount of chart-dependency.

While tactical modern warfare is not my favorite, I found the concept interesting. Liked the idea behind the point of view.

Ultimately could not get past the rule set. I must have read them 3 or 4 times but never could begin to understand the game. I must be slowing down or something, because I've handled large complex wargame rules in the past. However, looking at some of the other comments I don't feel so lonely.

Update: When I got Won by the Sword a much simpler game, that also has rules issues, I don't feel so bad. I think I can lay the blame on the designer. 

Traded.

Since I never actually played, I won't rate the game.

Highly commended for its emphasis on the commander working through the unit organizational and leadership structure.  Military units are not random collections of individuals or even of small groups (as per ASL)--they are layer upon layer of teams and leaders that have to be organized and coordinated if they are to achieve their objectives in the face of chaos.  Excellent rendering of small unit action.

Review after Five Pays:
Fields of Fire 2ed, GMT Games 
From publisher's website:
Fields of Fire is a solitaire game of commanding a rifle company between World War II and Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 – 4 hours.
Bottom Line Up Front, this is a great game. This game is heavier on the charts and tables than a lot of other games, but this is largely a mechanism of the game being strictly solitaire. Additionally there was a learning curve to gain mastery of the system to then start seeing how the game shines. I preordered this from GMT on the P500 and I am glad that I did, along with their decision to print it even though the numbers were not up there. All the parts and pieces are standard GMT quality, which is to say excellent, and of course I sleeved all of the cards for the game. 
The game mechanics for this game are based on cards, both for the action deck and the terrain deck. The action deck works like Combat Commander in that the Action deck provides everything the game needs to function. Like Combat Commander there are no dice, instead the cards give you numbers or results to actions. The cards look busy, but the player only uses a fraction of what’s on there for any one action. The cards also provide Orders or Command points like many other games. One of the aspects I like about this Initiative System is that there is both a leader based initiative segment and a general unit based segment, which I really like. The terrain for the game is also determined by card draws. There is a deck of terrain cards for Normandy, Korea, and Vietnam respectively. Each Mission tells you how many rows and columns you need to deal out and then the units move on the cards. This means that the replayability of a mission is endless. With five plays in of the first mission of the first campaign none of them have been the same.  
As stated above the initiative system is one of the elements of the game that I really like. As the Company Commander you are getting orders or commands from higher headquarters. This translates into command points, so that you can activate your subordinate commanders, similar to the Panzer Grenadier system. If you or a subordinate unit is within Command you get a greater number of actions. The Commander can then use his actions to activate a platoon or the Company XO or 1SG to draw for their own number of commands. Units then spend their commands to perform a list of actions that roughly break down into Command and Control, Movement, Combat, and Rally actions. Should a unit not be in command they still get a draw, but get commands at a lesser value. Once all the command units have acted there is an additional Initiative segment called General initiative in which units may perform an action on their own. I think that this is a great mechanic and effectively provides for lower unit leaders taking the initiative without bogging the game down with more leadership counters. 
After the terrain has been established and the objectives identified the graphic control measures are added to the map. These measures provide things like Phase Lines and Limits of Advance, which will help you control your units on the board. Once complete the Company Commander task organized his units and Company assets, these include mortars, machine guns, bazooka teams, and pyrotechnics. . The smoke and signals maybe used to give orders to the units for a limited cost, such as Red smoke means shift fire, or Red Star Cluster means infiltrate the Primary Objective. At this stage in the game you are asked to look at the map, design a plan for how you want to accomplish it, and then organize your forces to do so. I have not seen this level or planning before in a game and frankly it brought me back to my days as a Rifle Company Commander. The mental exercise of planning the mission was a joy in and of itself. This may be a little overwhelming to someone who is coming at the game cold, but even without any formal training or understanding of the rules the concept is simple. This is what you have and that’s where you are trying to go, figure it out. The ability to task organize means that platoons or Leaders will be able to give attachments group orders like the rest of their platoon in order to conserve Orders. The pyro also allows you to tie commands so the units perform that function without an Order. This saving of orders is important. 
The units will move out across the cards, which each have a potential contact marker on them. Through card draws and the level of existing combat you are able to determine what you find and where it shows up. As your units start to move across the board it gets harder and harder to command them with your leaders. I found this mechanic to be very true of combat actions that relied mostly on visual and voice communication. This also demonstrated the breakdown of Command and Control once an operation is underway. 
Combat. A turn is an undetermined length of time, this is important to understanding how combat works. With this firmly in mind it makes it easier to make game type decisions without getting lost. Thinking of a turn as a finite measure of time will lead you to making mistakes based on flawed logical assumptions. For instance, once units make contact with an enemy unit they automatically start firing at them and wont stop until ordered to do so, even if they move or are eliminated. Units place a volume of fire marker on a card, this determines the impact that the bullets or bits of metal have in that particular space. This is based on the type of fire, such as small arms, automatic machinegun fire, etc. When determining the combat modifier you use only the lowest number on the card. So small arms is Volume of Fire of o and Automatic VOF is -1. You will use the -1 and modify it for terrain. At first I was a bit skeptical of this as there was really no mechanism for mass of fire inherent in the VOF placement. Mechanically there is no difference between having one or three machine guns firing at the same positon. As I thought about this I was able to circle the square and rationalize it. The target is reacting to the volume of fire, more of the same isn’t necessarily going to create a different result. The game does however manage massing fire by having a Concentrate Fire command. This places a -1 maker on the VOF, which when you start playing you realize is a big deal. 
The game prides itself on being a model of modern small unit tactics. This is typically described as find, fix, flank, finish and is the basis of modern doctrine today. As previously stated the blasting away at a unit from one spot doesn’t increase your ability to eliminate enemy units. To effect that better you need to start to maneuver on the position by creating crossfire and attacking the unit from multiple directions. With this in mind it begins to make sense why the mass of fire mechanism works as it does. This encourages you to have to move on the enemy, which makes it harder to command and control your units, which makes command and signaling a real thing. I have had a couple of missions where a leader had to run up, to issue orders to troops to shift fire or to move. As the situation changes during the turn the VOF on the different cards may change. This is where it becomes critical to remember a turn is not a specific amount of time. A unit may move onto a card, find cover and start firing. This means the unit is both exposed and under cover at the same time to determine the combat modifier. This takes into account the status of the unit throughout a turn without only using the final resting place as a modifier. Once the combat segment starts all of the VOFs are frozen in place. This means that the fire that the unit was putting out is the level it will be resolved regardless of what happens to the unit as a result of receiving fire of its own. This means that combat results will not affect the current turn so it doesn’t matter in which order or where combat is resolved. As units take damage they start to fracture into fire teams and teams that can only perform a limited number of actions. This makes them less effective and harder to control. A failed attack or assault will rely be a high cost in Orders and reorganization time if it falls apart. I have laughed at a simple -1 VOF only to see a whole platoon get knocked to bits. I had a German light machine gun hold up a whole company advance as they pinned one unit to then shift fire on the attacking unit. Those guys surely got Iron Crosses. I have also had my Company Xo and all the support units get blasted on a hilltop with no cover when I thought that Line of Sight across the whole map would be a good base of fire position. I have also suffered a German Counter Attack which snatched victory from my hands. I am now starting the campaign game of linked missions, the experience system seems a bit clunky, but I’ll give it a shot. 
Invest the time to learn the rules, and just play. Make a decision and then go back and look it up later. Also take a look at some of the YOUTUBE videos that are out there. The game is fantastic, tells a great narrative, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it so far. If you want to feel like a commander of combat arms unit at the company and below level play this game.

Scary rulebook? Eh, not so much - however, I`m still struggling with some of the rules. Nevertheless, fun game with novel mechanics. I like "Volume of Fire" concept and "modular board" :)

(Where are IR equipment counters??? For me it takes away some fun of playing Vietnam missions)

Wargame donde acompañas a una div. de infantería, desde la IIGM hasta Vietnam, pasando por Corea. Gran nivel de detalles! Gestiona munición, tropas, comunicaciones, evacuación de heridos, transporte de prisioneros...IMPRESIONANTE!! Lo malo, que es laaaaargo como un día sin pan. Una partida puede llevarte 2 semanas dedicándole 1 hora y media al día prácticamente. Juego para dejar montado y jugar poco a poco. Es en solitario, aunque permite 2 players coop.

UPDATE (Upgraded to 9): After 6 plays I just want to play more (if I have the time for it, not always so) and I'm enjoying discovering the tactical nuances this game offers (smoke, assault, etc.)
***********
After just one play a tentative rating: it might well go up or down with a couple of games more under my belt :)

Rules aren't perfect but in no way so horrible as some people say. The errata is long but handles clarifications mostly. The errors on the counters are annoying, though.
The game as such _seems_ to be not so complicated once you master the rules (a similar feeling like in Magic Realm albeit FoF is a WAY easier) and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It seems to give you a lot of freedom and has a bit of RPG feeling.
I still have to wait to be sure it doesn't get repetitive with time (always a risk with solitaire games).

I avoided this game initially due to all the issues with the rulebook.  I decided to take a chance because of my experience with the ASL RB and found it to be far less difficult to learn then stated by many on this site.  Sure there are some rules you need to look up or figure out on your own but overall the rules were not that bad.

The gameplay is just tremendous.  The AI plays out very well and the fog of war is fantastic.  The game shines with the decision making process.  You have decisions from beginning to end with virtually no letup.  Your pregame plan and equipment assignments are very important.  Then you have to execute your plan without getting all your men killed.  Command and control are vital and (not being a combat vet but the designer is) the combat really 'feels' right based on the designer's notes.  The game mechanics overall are just perfect with the use of cards for both terrain and gameplay which gives a virtual endless amount or replay value.  Each mission (one of three wars) can easilly be played over and over again without any similarities.

My only knock on my rating is due to the real need for some tactics and or further explanation of some rules especially when playing defensive and patrol missions.  Some rules are too glossed over to be properly used to their full potential.

  Picked up the first edition in mint condition with the corrected counters.  Love the realistic command and control system with an emphasis on communication.  Absolutely love the modular map using cards with random encounters giving this game unlimited re-playability.  I'm using the most current rulebook PDF and YouTube to learn the rules, so far so good.  Looks like it might travel well using just the action and one terrain deck, the most essential counters, photocopys of the essential mission charts, with lots of note taking on scratch paper instead of using chits.  I like the idea of using dice for random number generation instead of flipping cards to minimize shuffling of the action deck.  Not really thrilled with the overuse of chits, just way too many of them.  However, I'm really getting hooked on this deep wargame that takes place over different eras.

I love some of the ideas here, but the gameplay itself ends up being both more procedural and fiddly than I would like.  I'd love to see someone take the basic concepts and streamline them (the combat system would work beautifully using historical area maps as well as the current card system), but right now the game is more work than fun.

Looks like a great solitaire game, but I'm waiting on the rules rewrite and additional examples of play to be published. Having read the draft and first printing rulebooks several times, and, since, seen the unrelenting tide of questions from struggling players washing in, there's no way I'm diving into this mess yet. But that doesn't mean I'm giving up on the game that may lie within, awaiting proper elucidation.

Still getting used to the rules and game flow. Very engaging and tense game. There is a lot to keep track of and a lot of unfamiliar concepts to wrap one's head around.

RATING: 7.5
Watching: Seems to have elements of Upfront (Terrain on cards) and playable in 1-2 hours.

Update:
Fun but somewhat fiddly and repetitive game of platoon-level combat across three campaigns (WWII, Korea and Vietnam). A random terrain is laid out and players have to capture objectives within 10 rounds. Most things are resolved by the action deck with a number generator. Expect lots of card flipping, shuffling and referring to charts and tables.

In most games, it boils down to how well you tactically manoeuvre your men around the board. Instead of blundering down as a whole platoon into an ambush or artillery bombardment, you can 'play' the game by splitting up your squad to and send out individual 'scouts' in order to quickly explore the terrain. Just remember to keep your lines of communication tight or you'll not be able to issue orders to your units.

The rules are in dire condition but the graphics are rather well done. Fills a niche in the market: there really isn't any game like this out there in the market and people will play this because of that. Jury still out on this one.

I have wargamed since the late 1960s and I worked more learning to play this game than any other. I had to ask a lot of questions in learning to play it. If it was not for BGG, I would have given up. I did do some things wrong at first. Takes a lot of effort to learn and play it and there is a lot of "bean counting". Good role playing game for a ROTC student. No mission will play the same way twice.GMT needs a better rule book and a detailed example of play. They posted one after I had got the game. I would like to thank Ricky and others who answered my questions. I guess the main feeling I got with play it was, THE PLAY WAS MORE WORK THAN FUN, maybe if I play it again my feelings will change. There is a good game here if there was a better rulebook and more examples of play.
***************************************
 I need to try this again using the 2nd edition rulebook and try the Vietnam period to see if my feelings will change. The subjects of volume II of FoF was more interesting to me than the first. I was very tempted to sell the game. IMHO there should be a lighter version of the rules if players wanted less detail. At this time 6/13/13
There are 131 pages on the forum post and the vast majority are probably questions. What does that tell you?

This is a unique tactical game, and maybe the most well thought out solitaire system available. I feel like the captain of the company and doing my best to command/control my troops as they disappear into the woods in front of me and all I can hear is pops and whizzes,
hoping my sergeants and non-coms now their jobs...

It takes patience the learn, the rulebook is sub-par, overly wordy and hard to locate answers to specific questions. But if you take your time, it's well worth the effort.

I am, quite frankly, astounded at how intimate I've become with this game. I've never been one to court a game with a 50+ page rulebook, but the innovation this game promises was enough to cast its spell on me and draw me in. I studied the rules and spent hours watching video tutorials. I've never wanted to love a game, or have it love me, so much.

Yet ultimately, we've decided to start seeing other people. I've kept her in the collection in the remote possibility that all my other games are destroyed by fire and I can give all my attention to her. But that's what she requires. She is quite needy. Even after I decided to strip out a significant portion of the rules (experience, pyro, comm) *and* even utilizing a seat-of-pants approach where I played fast and loose and it was okay to leave forgotten rules behind -- it was still too much. 

Which is a shame, because there is so much in her that is beautiful. But who could ever really know her? Even one of the most celebrated tutorial videos makes MULTIPLE mistakes over the course of its double-digit episodes. Has anyone ever played this game 100% correctly? 

Someday, Fields of Fire. Someday. But not today.

What a unique and potentially enthralling gaming experience. However, it is VERY difficult to get into (read impenetrable) - probably the worst rulebook I have ever read from GMT. 

Would have been much better issued as a basegame (WWII) and later modules (Korea and then Vietnam). I even tried playing this co-op with a buddy, and after a long hike, we gave up.

One of the worst hobby disappointment disasters that I have ever experienced.

Awesome game. One of my first wargames. There is a lot of things being said about the rules being complex, and the game being really hard to learn. I disagree completely. I downloaded the play example and followed along on vassal. Helped me understand the basic concept behind the game.

Then I read the latest version of the rules and got down to play. Sure, I had some questions, but I managed to play the game without problems. 

Suprising since I usually can't play anything with a weight higher than 3.0

The much talked about difficulty comes from the game being completely different from classical wargames. So wargamers can't use their previous experience to learn this game. But it is not difficult.

Don't believe what you hear, don't be afraid of the rules. Try it for yourself.

Traded because I don't have the time to play solo games.

First time I want to play a solitaire game again! I usually buy them, read them, play them one time... Then they go back to the pile. But this one is different. Enjoy the ride while you read the rules, decipher them (not that difficult, especially thanks to the great support and the willingness to put a solution to some of the things they lack: examples, clarifications, etc.) and take the plunge. This one reaches for me an 8 after the first play, and probably will go up from here.

UPDATE: With the new rules version there is no excuse for me not to give this deep game a ten, and so it reaches the heights of the few ones I'll take to a desert island. 

This kind of games makes me recall something a friend told me back when I started playing wargames, talking about the old Squad Leader from AH: "It's a shame you only buy games like this once."

But he was wrong, of course. You only have to wait for a new edition, version, whatever…

Fun solitaire game, though much more involved than most.

The theme works very well, and the game does a great job of recreating a war scenario, along with all the tension and unexpected events that can occur.

As many others here on BGG have suggested: don't give up on the rules.  Once you understand the game's method of turn order and conflict resolution, the game does flow pretty well.

Engrossing excellent mental game.  I spent a good bit of time with the 2nd ed instructions and Lancerdeuce's amazingly well done Youtube videos to get this one down.  While I'm still learning, it is such a fun thing to play and the feeling of true war on a small scale is there.

This is pretty much the one game that I am completely torn about. I both find the game completely genius and ultimately frustrating as well as completely compelling. This game doesn't really merit a rating, because it is both a brilliant example of innovation as well as having some of the worst excesses of wargaming that should be stamped out. A very good game if you want to examine the duality of all existence.

This game really does it for me! The narrative and simulation aspect is that high, that I really feel as I am commanding (or not ;) commanding in fact) of my company. The activating and giving orders mechanics are making this game what it is!

It is quiet different than "Ambush!", and most of the time I would prefer to play FoF.

RATING: 8
after three games (scenario 1+2 of WW2) it seems a little bit too simple. spread squads, move forward, resolve contacts, fight, call in arty and move heavy weapons, destroy enemy, repeat. 

Played again and found more decisions to make than I remembered. You must study the map carefully and look for good spotting places to set up your heavy weapons. If you encounter an enemy, you must decide if you want to bypass them or destroy them. The enemy frequently shifts fire, so it may be dangerous o move in heavy weapons and leaders - but you need them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Yes, the rules are daunting and kind of hard to navigate, and yes, there are some things that could be much clearer.  But once you've got the hang of it (and I felt like I was competent halfway through my second game), it opens right up and you get to play with a wonderfully immersive and gripping system.  The emphasis on command and control is like nothing I've played before, and it definitely encourages a different approach than the god's-eye view of other titles.  When a plan goes accordingly, it's a glorious feeling.  When it all goes FUBAR, as it so often does, the struggle to keep one's men alive is tense and very memorable.  

I could spend a lot of time highlighting the little bits and pieces of the game that really jumped out at me, like the skills and the pyrotechnics and the way grenade attacks are handled and the way your men will attempt to reduce a village to rubble, even if there's no one there, until you order them to stop shooting already.  But that would make for a long list.  Suffice to say, I'm very glad I took the plunge.

Go read DavidJJ's notes on FoF, he nails my own intense love/hate relationship with this game.

Such mixed feelings, the sort you'd expect. It's a brilliant design & I can easily rate this a 10 or lower, there's a fiddliness  that kept cropping up, yet the game narrative never lost it's suspense. Such hard work to get there, amazing narrative & ideas & modeling that felt so sharp. I spent a great deal of time with it, and it drew me in with growing excitement. It is definitely unique and has integrity. I admire the designer and trust him. I just couldn't, in the end, sustain his vision because the commitment because a sudden tiredness hit me when I went to pull it down, and I discovered I'd rather spend such tie with a game to get some history - a larger sweep - then following the evolving missions & platoons.

The rules were a struggle, even tho I accept one must approach this game with a free-flowing stance rather than a rules-lawyer attitude, if that makes sense. But the criticism of the rules are warranted, in that the leap one must make to grok the basics of what the designer is trying to get across is a shaky one. So even without needing to rules-lawyer edgecases (common sense & staying true to the subject & narrative is fine by me), I needed more consistency in the language used both for things and for ideas. Else, experience within an infantry platoon that I don't have, and right there I'm saying anyone with infantry experience would be all over this. And even as I say this, Rachel Simmons rules share a similar rigid structure - I wish there were more editorializing & designer notes to help you understand the lovely thing that's there - and ideas that subvert the whole genre, and her games I found rewarded the effort. 

In the end getting to the flow pleased and then exhausted me. It felt too much like a kit to houserule for me to move on to helicopters & the Vietnam scenarios. Putting it aside for even a few weeks & I lost too much to make it what it should be, something you can invest in at first but then pick up and immediately leap into a new narrative.

I do think it's brilliant. I hope the project gets someone far enough away from the game to make both a more clear & consistent ruleset and to also translate it's ideas with more clarity. I hope the re-print & FOF II do this, it's worth GMTs investment, and if so I'll be back.

* Note: recent rumors indicate a true rules makeover + detailed play examples... well worth the time for the reprint.

I have been waiting for a game like this for a LONG time. The rules take some effort to digest and internalize and need some clarifications and clean up (as many many others have written about) but once you have put in the effort the flow of the game takes over and the rules become easier to deal with. After lots of reading in the forums etc., printing out the reorganized rules that someone did, and re-playing the first few missions a bunch of times, I believe that I have 95% of the rules down. Situations still pop up that require clarification and interpretation but I am fairly confident that I am playing it the way it is intended to be played. For me the complexity is a huge PLUS and intensifies the experience.  


This is without a doubt one of the most unique and innovative solo games that I have ever played. Totally immersive... great narrative... lots of decisions... beautiful graphics... tons of re-playability... it has completely captivated me. I feel like I am playing a war movie though not in a cheesy way. I have read a lot of first person battle accounts and this game compliments those narratives. In other words - as much as a game can - it gives a very 'real' feeling of command and control in a bloody and chaotic fight. As the battle unfolds and chaos overtakes the battlefield, earlier decisions can come back to haunt you or save the situation - and you have to be able to adjust to an ever changing situation on the ground. Trying to maintain your tenuous grasp of control adds deliciois tension. And I have never had a game were I actually feel/care for the chits as I do in this game. Those are my men damn it!

Fields of Fire is a game that I keep thinking about and wanting to play and it keeps me up well into the night during the work week. It has been a very long time since a game has done that for me. It was worth the wait as I followed this games development for a long time.

I thought I would really like this one from Knizia as it reminded me a bit of En Garde and Shoot Out which are very cool little games, but this doesn't come across as a Knizia game. I found the rules clunky and a bit confusing to explain to new players. Not as fun as I thought it would be so unfortunately I don't play it much.

{10+ plays} Knizia has designed the better Tug of War game (Heave Ho being the other one), and I like it - there are definitely some nice things going on here... but none of it really stuck with me.  Plus it's just a bit too complicated to teach to nongamers.  I'd rather play Schotten-Totten or Lost Cities, even though those games are not *like* this one at all, but I wouldn't turn down a play of this.  Took a few plays to get all the rules right.  And great bits.

As a member of the Kosmos 2-player series, this game is an improvement over recent games in the series.  That said, it is not the best game in the series either.  Game play can definitely feel a bit tit-for-tat.  There is definitely strategy but it is hard to control if the cards don't come up for you.  The end result is a a respectable but middle of the road game. [GTI: AGCL]

Wasn't a big fan of Times Square. It's a abstract where you are playing cards to move certain pieces along a track and trying to get other certain pieces to your end.

It seems there are a lot of 2-player games that focus on a tug-of-war mechanism, and this is another in that vein. What makes this one unique is that you are tugging on 6 different items and you make them move in slightly different ways. The game does feel a bit swingy, because a really good set of cards can suddenly turn the tables and even grant one player the win if they get them at the right time. I also felt that it was fairly obvious on most turns which of my cards I should play and in which order once I had the rules down. Now I've only played once, but if that is the case then this game would be tremendously luck dependent based on who got the better cards, and it might start to feel like the game is playing me rather than the other way around. Yet I can't deny I had a good time playing the game, and I would gladly play again if someone asked. If I had more 2-player opportunities this would not be on my must-buy list, but it might be one I'd consider trading for just to explore it a bit more.

I enjoy this game. It plays fast (about 15 minutes), the rules are pretty simple once you have played the game, and there is more going on then you think. I love the fact that even my 6 year old can play this. I love using Hans and his ability. Shhh... I hear something! Hans is playing his music!!! The theme might not be so appealing for kids. How about a king, a queen, two knights, a princess and a minstrel and a castle with a drawbridge on either side? I am sure kids would dig that.

I like this an occasional 2 player diversion.  There's not a lot to the game, but there can be a real feeling of momentum change during the game which makes it interesting.   The pieces are a little strange but functional.

The rules are, however, far too complicated for what this game is.  Not the best design.

I have a suspicion that Knizia came up with this one on the toilet. I actually like the NYC theme, but the typical Knizia back-and-forth/tug-of-war gameplay makes what should be a ten-minute game last upwards of 30 minutes. No thanks. At times it seems almost like a boardgame version of War (only with prostitutes and drunks).

Upgraded my rating after a few plays; now I "get" it.  The first time I played I thought there was very little to the game. It takes a few plays to understand the subtlety of the game.  It is a very good "tug of war" and the offensive and defensive positioning moves back and forth as well.

Hilariously cheesy little tug-o-war game by Knizia that has a few too many rules, but when you step back and look at them, you realize they all sort of model reality correctly, so you end up not caring so much.  It'd be fun to have a live-action version of this game.

RATING: 8
10 plays (mostly losses) --Wow, good game!  Tricky, hard choices, tactics, quick. Anguish and hilarity. And seems quite original. The combination of card management, powers and limitations brings more than I thought. I spent a couple hours learning this, drinking beer, and becoming more humble--which doesn't often come with beer. Not too much like Duell, which superficiality has elements in common (but is not as rich). More interesting, I think, to compare/contrast with Battle Line, with which it doesn't have much in common (and is also quite good). Maybe: More ways to win in Time Square, more possibilities of play combos, more dynamics and trickiness, a bit more luck... More pinpointed cerebral calculation in BL, at best refined down to the luck of the last cards ? --I'm testing these ideas/ I'm not sure. The theme is delightful. I think it's a "just one more time" game. Note to self, examine the German translation here. Self replies, will do.

Fun tug-of-war game that can have a tendency to drag on.  The multi-layered push and pull (between the green and yellow pawns) makes for some interesting decisions and where to focus your efforts.

In the end, I found the multi-tiered system better executed and more interesting in Carolus Magnus, which offers even more streamlined play and lower rules overhead.  The lack of asymmetry made the game feel pretty same-y after a while.  I certainly got my money's worth out of it, but am not terribly upset to see it leave my collection.  Traded.

As with many Kosmos 2-player games, this is a tug of war as you try to make the best short-term move for long-term gain.  Play the right combination of cards to lure the denizens of Times Square to your nightclub and away from your opponent's side.

I appreciate the mechanics but am having trouble wrapping my brain around it.  Hopefully with more plays I can appreciate its potential.

RATING: 5
Components: Fun, sturdy pawns; nice artwork on the cards; clear iconography.

Experience: More fun than I thought it would be. Eight cards in a hand is enough to give a player some options, both for play and for budgeting. It's fun to save up cards for a character and move their pawn drastically in one turn, or to make clever use of a special power. The different ways to influence Champaign Charlie, and to win the game, are more interesting and less of a tug-of-war than I had anticipated.

Still, the fortunes of a player can swing suddenly, and once a player has a critical mass of pawns on their side of the board, it's difficult to win them back. I can't quite tell if this game is strategic or just a total crap shoot.

Players are restaurant owners in Hamburg's red light district, trying to attract the party crowd into their establishment.  Two player Knizia game sees players play sets of coloured cards to position six nifty wooden pieces up and down the Honeybears-like track.  The pawns do different things - Hans is an irresistible accordion player who teleports other figures to him; Lola can bewitch other figures and take over their movement; Lilly shuffles around with her minders - two bodyguards.  Charlie oversees it all and moves towards the party crowd at the end of each turn.  The object is to get Charlie or Lilly into your restaurant, or as close as possible by the time the deck has been exhausted twice.  Nice game of tug of war - initially wasn't impressed with it, but certainly rewards repeated play.  Excellent.

Still, I'm glad I had a chance to play it.

Seemed extremely clunky for a Knizia game. Times Square just seems to be far too reactionary of a game. You do this. I do that. You do this. And so on.

Times Square is a game I like far more than anyone I know. It's almost entirely tactical, which will be a sticking point for some players.

It seems quite tricky at first to grasp what is going on. The special conditions, the imbalanced cards, you really need a good grasp on what the options and rules are. But, when you have this grasp, the possibilities open up like a flower. I ended the winner quite comfortably, but regardless, I really enjoyed the challenge. It's very different from other games, like Duell, and feels very fresh. It's going straight on my shopping list.

I've seen this game described as a "tug of war" and I agree. There is always the risk of seeing the other pulling too strongly and winning early, but the game seems to have a tendency to last until the last card is picked up.

An optimized version of Knizia's own "En garde".

Times Square is a quick, card driven tug of war.  Two characters (Hansome Hal and Dancing Deb) possess a special ability that can drastically alter the positions on the board in exchange for a round of normal card play.  The powers may seem at times overly powerful but the trick is being able to position yourself in order to take advantage.  Card draws do influence the outcome and sometimes absolutely, but Times Square plays quick enough that in the case you are completely sunk by cards you can quickly reset and begin again.  There are enough decisions involved that this isn't an entirely braindead exercise, and smart decisions at the right time can soften the luck involved or allow for clever play, but as aforementioned the quickness of play allows for any bad luck to even out over a couple rounds. A fun two player game.

The whimsical appearance belies its complexity and subtlety. Multiple paths to victory mean there's often a Plan B, even when the luck of the draw leaves you dry.

Vacuous, unengaging card game from Knizia and Kosmos.  With Knizia you expect to see hidden depth even in his lighter, simpler games.  That doesn't appear to be the case with Times Square, where good play consists of mindlessly cycling as many cards as possible through your hand.  It doesn't even work as a kid's game because of the "red light district" theme.

RATING: 9
Twenty-nine plays. Woefully underrated! A strange & subtle tug of war game, supposedly based on the German film comedy "Auf der Reeperbahn nachts um halb eins" but probably better Americanized as "Bourbon Street." You must try to move one of two green partygoer pawns to your end of the board, though much of your progress is made via the two musician pawns. It strikes me as a game like backgammon or gin rummy in that it's a blend of luck and skill...and Times Square might be the least luck-dependent of the three. 

Basically, you get out of the game what you put into it: if you play carelessly, it's a luckfest; if you think about your moves, it becomes a lot more interesting. At the end it can seem to have been all about having the cards you needed to pull off the final stroke, but what really wins you the game is everything you did to get yourself to that point.

Times Square is a better version of En Garde/Duell with added, and necessary, complexity and abilities.  I think it's fun and do feel that as a player, you have control over how the game plays out (instead of the game is decided on the first turn, or first player always wins line of thinking I've seen surround this game).  Times Square may not be the best game ever, but it is probably the best tug of war game I've played yet.

Update:  After about twenty or thirty games of this, I would say the first player wins 60-75% of the time.  As long as one player doesn't get a phenomenally good or bad hand, things are more or less decided from the get go.  For a potentially broken game, it's still short and sweet.  I enjoy it, regardless.

Aug08: Maybe there are hidden depths after many plays.  I just wasn't pulled in enough to want to try.  It's also a tug-of-war based game, and I don't really like that mechanic.

It takes awhile to understand all the different characters and the way they interact.  In fact, it probably takes as long to understand them all as it does to play the game.  It's over lightning fast.

Just nothing here to really speak of.

A read-through of the rules had me totally confused, but in playing, the special rules around the different pieces were clear enough. The card play is straight-forward. I think the primary difficulty of this game is that it is a "tweener", with rules that are too finicky for a non-gamer, but with too much randomizing card play for  a more serious gamer. The special rules around each piece make the game feel pretty unique, which is a plus. There's nothing here that I particularly fell in love with, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I dunno.  The hand management element completely eludes me in this game. It seems that you have little choice but to play out your entire hand each turn, especially if that is what your opponent does every turn. Why would you ever choose to discard your entire hand without playing anything when its pretty easy to play out all the cards in your hand anyway?  Also, it seems that your opponent would pretty much have to fall asleep to make "Luring Handsome Hal" ever a viable option during a game.  At first blush, the game appeared to have a lot of moving parts and opportunities for clever play, but it really does seem to me after several plays that its just an exercise in who gets the right cards at the right time.  I am mystified by the comparisons to Duell, this game is nothing like it.

A friend picked up a free copy of this at a convention. Never would have come across it otherwise. Reading the rules for the first time is almost like an SNL skit for gamers: we burst out laughing more than once at all the clarifications and exceptions and interrelations, all built around a small board and five wooden pieces with names like "Dancing Debby." But, if you shrug off the initial incredulity, this is a fast paced game of hand management. The theme is on par with something like "Elfenland" - so ridiculous you end up entertained by it. Also, I'm told that in the German edition the location is a red-light district, which also makes this pretty funny. I wouldn't tell anyone to run out and pay money for this (if you're looking for two player Kosmos titles, go with Odin's Ravens, and if you want something with a little more meat to it, go with Mr. Jack), but this is a decent game. 

Update: rated a 6 after five plays. Quite simply, I suspect that this game is "faking it," but I can't be sure quite yet. I enjoy hand management games, but here my experience is close to autopilot. You need to blitz your opponent with a point or two every round if you can manage it, which means you want to play 3-5 cards in a single move if you can help it. That way, your draw rate helps ensure more big moves. It seems that if you're stuck without a big move, you can take that turn to discard five cards, nearly guaranteeing a big move next turn. The only thing I've left to investigate here is the secondary end-game rules. Players who know what they're doing (know how to cycle lots of card) will probably make it through the deck twice, so then it's a matter of ending the game with Sue on your side. Skill involved here is anyone's guess at this point. UPDATE: After a couple more plays this one has lost any allure for me. It's like an optical illusion of a game. Decisions are obvious, and you have to play cards in large groups above all else.

For a hand management game with boatloads more skill, play Odin's Ravens.

The negative feedback on this game is very high, but the few ratings of praise I've seen made me think that I should at least try the game out.

Picking it up for $5 seemed fair, but it took a while to get this one to the table, mainly because of the slightly confusing rules.

The rules are actually unusually complex for such a simple game and are a little hard to explain.  An included player aid would have been nice for the first few plays.  But once you've started it feels pretty simple and is actually kind of fun.  I know that these tug of war games can be pretty annoying, but it feels like your decisions are actually pretty meaningful.

People always accuse Knizia of pasted-on themes, but I can't imagine how this game would have been created any other way than theme first.  Can you imagine the initial play tests of this game?

"Well there's one guy, he always has to be between these two guys.  Then there's a second guy, but if he's between this guy and your side of the board, you can play cards of that guy for any of your guys.  And there's another guy that can pull other guys over to itself."

A strongly misunderstood gem.

I loved its artwork and components at first sight. But first it seemed like a game of of pure luck, everything depending on the cards you draw. And yes a lot depends on the cards but the winner will be the one that can best use their cards. The more I play it the more I can see it's a game of skill and experience - it has quite a long learning curve and it reveals surprising depths with time. Also I find it quite unique, and while unusual, still having many Knizia touches: well-balanced complexity rooting in some simple rules of special moves, card discard triggering end of game when I want it. See my detailed review [thread=431865]here[/thread]. I wrote that review after a few plays but now it's my most-played game ever :o and I plan to re-visit it in a new review when I reach 10 plays. It deserves it.

It's reminiscent of En Garde but with character powers and special card plays.  I like this tug-of-war game much better.  This is one of those games that is far deeper than one really thinks.  The rules are somewhat simple.  There are some good combinations of card play and card management that is not realized until you have those cards available to you in one hand.  Thus, I think it takes a few games to realize the full potential of replayability that Times Square has to offer.

Some have compared this to a game of tug-a-war, but for some reason it reminds me more of being whipped uncontrollably by a bungee cord because this game is the closest to [gameid=25103] that I've ever played. We all know Fizzban right? This is the game that James T Kirk invents to distract his opponents and get the upperhand. Both games are fraught with rules that are based on conditionals. For example, in Times Square, the red piece may be used as a joker if she is between you and the green piece. Another example, the champaign bottle moves towards you if you have a piece in your entrance area. And so on.

This type of experience was done much better with Knizia's simplier [gameid=9735].

Initial rating after a few plays. THis is clearly a game that will need to be played a few times before its subtleties become apparent. We enjoyed our first few rounds. You basically need to consider the Saucy Sue / Bodyguards group as one element of the game and the Dancing Deb / Hansom Hal pair as modifiers to that group. Once we figured that out, the game began to make sense. We actually place them on opposite sides of the track to reinforce this perception. The rules are a bit finicky, but once you figure them out the game goes pretty quickly.

It feels like Chess with cards. Tug of war chess with cards. Or something. (Doesn't Knizia have an actual Chess with cards game?) But I always feel overwhelmed when I play chess, not just because it's deep, but because I don't know where to start exploring that depth. I don't have that problem with Times Square. The options available with your hand of eight cards are not small, but they feel manageable. After all, Times Square is a short, light card game, albeit one with opportunities for some strategy. 

The wife loves it. It's kicked Lost Cities aside. Alas, just as I'd started to win against her. Now I'm losing game after game of Times Square. But it's fun, and gosh dang it, I will win!

A note on theme: sure the title is misleading, but the concept of drawing important patrons to your bar is spot on. Of the characters my wife said, "I like their different personalities." Personalities she's only inferred from each character's movement rules. People say this is a mostly abstract game, but if that ain't theme then what is? I don't really give two toots about theme, but for a light card game, Times Square's theme matches its mechanics very well.

Nice little 2-player game with some interesting elements.  The piece names are really awful, but oh well.  I think the pieces might make more sense if they were named for more contemporary icons like, the Diva and her bodyguards, the Critic (who slowly gravitates towards a nightclub, the Diva's Ex, who attracts the Diva (but only with her bodyguards tagging along) and the Singer, who attracts folks with HER (cards) songs.  It is the so-what-do-the-pieces-do-again? rules that hurt the fun factor.  I can see how if you really got into it, you might find fun in the mechanics, but it's a tough hump to get over.  Still, it's quite a clever design.

I read the rules a few years back and even attempted to teach it to my wife, but we were tired, and the rules seemed odd. We aborted the attempt and it sat on the shelf.  It was even tagged for trade.  I'd only paid a few dollars for it on a whim so figured it must be "meh", and frankly it seemed to be a poorly themed abstract.

I finally broke it out again, determined to play it before getting rid of it.  The rules seem kind of complicated at first glance, but once you play, that goes away.

Boy were we surprised.  This is my wife's new favorite game.  The gameplay is incredibly fast, but far far deeper than it first appears.  Even the theme works pretty well after a while as you lament Hal's sudden movement or Deb's alluring call to another character.  It's far less abstract than it first appears.

This game is a keeper and might be the biggest surprise in my collection.  How such elegant gameplay emerges from such humble origins  is quite a feat.  Knizia is easy to poke fun at, but the man is incredibly talented.

I was sure I would hate this game, but now it holds one of my highest ratings.  Enough said.

Part of the "Great Knizia Purge of 2014," all I remember about this game was that it was boredom personified, with the only action going on being the actual push and pull back-and-forth of a couple of wooden pieces on a small board.  I could look at the pendulum on a clock and derive as much pleasure...

Held off on this one for a long time but glad I finally caved: it's a very good little tug-o-war of a game with rich tactical play. I wish Kosmos would have kept the Hamburg red-light district theme--I hate it when American versions of things are sanitized or dumbed down (like changing the title of the first Harry Potter book from Philosopher's to Sorceror's Stone). Back to Times Square: is it even possible to win by drawing Saucy Sue all the way to your nightclub? More plays will tell. [8 plays]

Times Square is a card driven 2-player game in the Kosmos series. The players are trying to manipulate a series of influential figures within Times Square as they draw other revellers to your swinging nightspot. 

The game plays out very much like a game of tug 'o' war as certain figures can only be moved if they adhere to certain parameters. 

The game really is all about hand management and clever card play to take advantage of your opponent's relative position and cards in hand. 

A very good game that sits in the upper echelon of the Kosmos 2P series but not one of the absolute best.

[i]Was taught this game by Mat and thought it was okay. While some of the different restraints on moving the various pieces was interesting (especially how the diva only moved between her two bodyguards) it is not a game I feel the need to add to my collection. I find some of Knizia's other card games are not only more streamlined, but also offer more interesting tactical decisions ([thing=760][/thing] springs to mind). I also prefer the push your luck aspect found in [thing=50][/thing].[/i]

It seems like you can do cunning things, but I think it all boils down to playing as many cards as you can in your turn, and hoping for a bunch of good useful cards on the re-fill. Then, it's over all too quickly and you don't really feel like it's worthy of replay so away it goes.

A sweet little game with more strategy that you would expect for such simple rules.  

Unfortunately the ending comes suddenly and arbitrarily.  My favorite Knizia games (Battle Line, Samurai) have a feeling of narrowing possibilites as the game approaches the end. The design and bits are very good, as typical of Kosmos production, which enhances this one considerably.

This uses the body of En Garde adding knobs and wolf whistles. A provocative theme which could be marketed in Sydney with the title "Kings Cross". Getting a feel that obviously the game kicks in after the deck is exhausted once, card counting seems to be a viable tactic and you need to think two turns ahead. As the gameplay and victory is all about positional placement, it is very much a puzzle game which you try to solve with the cards you have and anticipate to draw (from a deck which is really too detailed to be familiar with straight away). Gosh, I need another drink and...er afterwards have a smoke. Danke!

RATING: 3
Played five rounds of the game, every single time starting player won. Forums have this issue come up, and then the games fans come rushing in. My issue comes that after five games (alternating who is first player), there was a 100% first player win rate. If it was 70%, then the game would just be a challenge to beat the stronger first player, but it really feels like the first player over the first few turns gets a notable edge that the other player does all they can but fails to slow them down, let alone stop them. Curious to try it out with other people, but tactically there seem to be a few simple things to do, and once you get the solid edge it's just a waiting game.

Update: Played three more rounds with a new player, and I lost all three times (two times first player, one time second). Maybe this game just has some real heavy weight to what cards you draw. Still a problematic element (that might be resolved by a better discard methodology to aid in shuffling), but one I can live with a lot more, and will improve its rating significantly.

Seemed like an interesting 2 player game, but will need additional plays to get a better feel for how I'd rate it.  It seemed like getting good cards early could heavily skew the game without much ability to defend, but that may be an unlikely situation (that just happened in my one play).

Excellent two player game. Several ways to win and if you aren't paying attention your opponent can sneak into a quick win by slipping Saucy Sue into their club while you nod off. You can develop a bit of a strategy game to game, but this is certainly more of a tactical (if not chaotic at times) game.

* Easy to learn/teach

Update: I've picked this up again after a longer rest period, and, having discovered still more subtleties, I'm even more impressed than initially. Still better than "En Garde/Duell". An ingenious game of tactical hand management, probably the best 2-player-only Knizia I've played. With two similar experienced players, it's quick and a real blast.

Original game with a cute theme. Especially the german version has a nostalgic flair, reminding of some actors from the fifties. At first glance I thought this would be a fruitless back-and forth shifting of the main characters until the deck is exhausted twice. But it's like with a lot of Reiner games, when you study the rules for the first time you think: does this work? It takes a number of plays to find out how to make best use of the different "special abilities" of the "characters" and when, depending on your cards and the moves of your opponent. Charlie moves deceivingly slow, but can be hard to stop. On the other hand, first snatching the nearest bodyguard with Hans (or Hal) (who's already at your entrance) and then moving Lilly (aka Sue) fast with some high Lola (Deb) cards isn't bad either. Try it out!

This is quite an unenjoyable experience.

The reality of this game is that some cards are just better than other cards.  I don't really see any clever play here, you just play the best groupings of cards that you've drawn to get you as many points as possible.  There isn't much room for anything other than responsive tactics, you can try to plan for your next turn but chances are players will counter whatever you are up to.  The Saucy cards are especially underpowered compared to the red lady cards, and to make it worse they just tie up your hand until it is worthwhile to use them.

Overall, YUCK.

If Knizia didn't put this out I doubt it would be getting this high of regard.  If you want a good Tug of War game check out Zwergen Ziehen.

Love, love, love this excellent tug of war game.  It takes 5 minutes to learn and a game or two for it to stick, but then you will find yourself at countless new and unusual situtations  to navigate.  Like Chess in that the pieces all have different abilities that can be useful in different situations based on your cards and your opponent's position.  At first it seems luck based, but once you begin to play more and think about your moves, it becomes much more interesting.  I can see see this getting countless replays!!!  Can't stop thinking about this game!

Auf der Reeperbahn (the original title) is a game that really improves with familiarity, becoming more subtle and devious the more experience you get.  It may take 20 minutes to learn and a few games to get the point, but once you've got it, the head-to-head competition, balancing all the different things you can do, is extremely interesting.  After another three dozen plays you will still keep finding yourselves at some nuanced decision pivot you'd never exactly seen or anticipated.  This game is well worth the investment of time to learn and learn well.

RATING: 7
[RGG 2006 edition] {Pub, couple; hand management} Times Square is a thematic 2p game, in which each player tries to attract the most people to their pub in Times Square.  It's a twist of the tug of war race and players have to control 6(or 5?) different figures in TS.

Similar to Balloon Cup and Lost Cities, it is a hand management card game. Players have to wisely play and exchange their cards to maximize the gain.  However, this is not as unforgiving as Lost Cities and is more effective than Balloon Cup.  Therefore, it soon becomes one of my favorite 2p games in my collection. It involves more luck than Lost Cities; however, it's not totally out of control. Wise use of Handsome Hal and Dancing Deb is very important and players have to predict early how their opponent uses the characters.

I like the bits very much. The wooden figures are nicely crafted to show different body shape. The cards are nicely illustrated and linen-produced. The 3-fold board is very effectively, too.

Three rounds and I lost all three times might have been a bummer but since the game is so short the build-up brief, it isn't so much of a crash when the loss comes in. We were also getting the rules right in our head so that meant a little back in forth (ha!). My ability to play more competitively also improved exponentially, so I look forward to the day when I can finally take my husband's smug little face down angry This must be what he feels like any time we play set collection games with me whistle 

The thing that makes this a winner for our needs is definitely the rapid play and quick set-up. Not a game we would have picked out for ourselves (it was a Secret Santa gift) but one which fits our needs wonderfully.

Critics of this game say there are no real choices, no control and winning is largely dependent on card draws.

I do agree that luck of the draw does play a large role, but I think there are real choices and control.  The feel of Times Square reminds me of two other games: Cribbage and Aton.

It is like cribbage in that a practiced player will learn what the percentage plays are and often play accordingly, so the card draws do factor heavily in the outcome.  And like cribbage, I enjoy the activity and watching it play out.

But Times Square, like Aton, also has a tension of maintaining a balance of advancing your own agenda while trying to react to what your opponent is doing.  

At the two extremes both players can play entirely defensively only working to thwart the opponents plans.  This usually leads to a longer game that ends very closely.  

One or both players can also be very aggressive and soley focus on their plan.  This usually leads to a quicker game that ends in a lopsided win or loss. 

Card draws still play an important part in both strategies, but the balance of push-pull is fun and does create interesting decisions.

The luck is there, but there is defintely enough meat to justify the playtime and cost of this filler.

Update:
I have just been playing En Garde for the first time and the depth is obvious.  Times Square feels like a reworking of En Garde with more stuff.  The "stuff" makes it harder to tell if there is the same depth (or more) as En Garde. I will say that my plays of En Garde might help me better understand what is under the hood of Times Square.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 4

I never gave this much of a look because the theme never grabbed me at all.  However, picked up a used copy after having learned a little more about the play. Wow. Played my gamer daughter, and she, very respectably, cleaned my clock. Played 3 games, and still haven't beaten her, and I'm only getting better by learning from her victories.  Card play is very interesting, and doesn't feel at all like I'm getting unlucky with cards, but truly being out-skilled. By an 8.5 year old.  Smart kid; proud father.  Still, I feel like Death in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.

We first opened it and gave it a shot, 10 plays later it was a pretty sweet light two player game.  After the first five, we had strong concerns that the first player would be too strong, but we improved our skill at moving Champagne Charlie and those concerns were largely mitigated.  Its hand management, but its difficult to set up plays because you are always responding to fires that your opponent lit.  Its one of those games where one player will be dictating moves to the other player, and trying to flip the control of the board and dictate tempo is the major goal.  This game is sprinkled with knizia magic powder.  

Its a whole lot of fun in a very little time frame. 

20 plays the first month after I purchased it.  We'll see how it holds up.  

Holy crap, I've played this 32 times.  This game is sneaky fun.

40 Plays in... this game is going to be a constant go to.

Played a few times.  It's tug-of-war with some special card/token powers.  Haven't played enough to know if it's just luck of cards or if there's enough strategy/tactics to the game.

This game is pretty good but I hate how my mom gets really mad at me every time I win. That I dont like but otherwise the game is ok. I didn't rate it 6 because of my mom but because it is basic and fun.

A really underrated game in my opinion. This game is a little similar to en garde in some sense but is not as visible as the latter. This is quite unfortunate since I find this game to be more entertaining and tactical as some other game. There is no long term strategy.You must play according to the hand you have and to best use your opponent's move to your advantage. The game is short and so no long term planning can be done. Quite often a mistake in one move or a slip up from your opponent is what you hope for so you can capitalize with the cards in your hand to push Saucy Sue closer to your edge. One may think this game is all purely luck, but that is not always the case, unless you are pretty unlucky.

One gripe: The rules are not very well hashed out and the rule book has numerous errors.Correct it! There are also some ambiguities in the movement of Dancing Deb.

Underrated two-player tug of war game with a very different feel from any other game I've played. There is luck, but hand management is a huge part of the game, and there is lots of room for tactical maneuvering. Really enjoying this one.

Quite simple, but still tactic game with enough content compared to the game length.

Players are night club owners, who try to get customers into their club and out of the opponents club. Potential customers are moved by playing a set of cards.

After one game feels good, I'd like to play more.

A simple game of hand management. Reminded me of a game of tug-of-war. Pull the piece to your side to win the game. I'm not sure if the '6' rating will hold up after more plays.

UPDATE 11/17: For sale. Has the same problem as many couples' games. You have a tug of war until, eventually, the deck runs out and the game fizzles out.

Based on one play, I prefer this to Lost Cities. It's quirky, but seems like it will be a challenge to master. One of my favourites of the Kosmos two-player line so far, although not a patch on the wonderful Blue Moon.

So, where's the love for Times Square?  It's in Atlanta, with Stven Carlberg.  Get him to teach you the game and tease you along with game after game after game to get your interest, and I'll bet that you're going to want to get yourself a copy.  I don't want to say it's "elegant" (some of the mechanisms are difficult to really understand how best to manipulate), but it's reminiscent of Duell, about as simple and challenging as a game can get.  There's some give-and-take, and knowing when to do one or the other, about the game that's unique and intriguing.  There's a nice agony over knowing how to move Saucy Sal and her bodyguards that I still haven't figured out, though.

Very reminiscent of Knizia's Duell but with a need to manage cards for more than 1 figure.  Still a very good 2 player "cafe" game but a notch below Duell due to a less appealing theme for me.

Fun little push-pull game.  Very good mechanics as you might expect from Dr. Knizia and a fast play-time.  I think this is a better game than Duel, another game of the same ilk by the same designer.

Simple fun smart 2 players game, you want to play a second time after the first game ended. Mostly tactical, not much strategy i would say...; sometimes games are short but sometimes they reach the end of the second deck and there's a massive amount of anxiety and anticipation... this game is better and better after each lunch break!

[EDIT]: I now think, after 20+ games, that this is one of the best non-combinatorial 2 players game around. Period.

Tense struggle for control of the characters on the board. Quick to play. Very unusual mechanics. Seems like it can't work, but somehow it does. Some people complain that Knizia keeps re-using the same mechanics; this game is proof that at least some of his games are really unique, interesting, and fun.

You can easily handicap this game by changing the size of your hand. My 6 year old daughter and I really enjoy playing; she beats me every time when I have a hand of 6 (to her hand of 8), when I have a hand of 7 to her hand of 8 then it's pretty close.

It's only 2 player, and you could argue that the game is ultimately decided by the cards you draw, but that is true of any card game. The back and forth and move-countermove between players is fascinating. Champagne Charlie, Saucy Sue, Dancing Deb and Handsome Hal are my new best friends.

After 2+ Plays: After reading the rules I was prepared to hate this game.  I generally dislike tug-of-war type games, as the back and forth just feels pointless.  However, the way the special powers of the different pieces interact is really neat, and prevents the pointless feeling I was expecting.  The tactics were a little odd, so I need a few more plays to really know how I feel.

In short, Fabled Fruit is a race of drawing cards. The first to draw the right cards wins. A cynical view on the matter would be that there are two factors that determine the winner: 
1) luck of draw
2) the number of cards you draw

To be fair, the above is not a fair statement since there are other factors as well. First of all, you have to phase your game so that you are always one step ahead of everyone else. Otherwise you'll just find yourself being blocked from the actions you want all the time. Secondly, you have to seize the opportunities when they present themselves because chances of getting an edge over the others are scarce. 

The game looks nice and I like the ever varying list of actions. They make each play different. It is a nice touch that you can have a semi-legacy game without having a need for the same people to stay in the group.

But in the end it is just a race with very small margins.

I love Power Grid, so I was very interested in this comparitively simple game. The art is fun and the gameplay is also interesting without being too complex. This would be a great kids game, since it had so much extensibility to it. We started with the first 6 animals and only got to the next one or two before game end. The fact that there's more than 40 makes the game a sort of pseudo-legacy game with interesting amounts of replayability.

The fable system works to make what would otherwise probably be a middling game into something quite interesting. There's a large deck of cards in here so you aren't going to see the bottom for quite a few games (I think I'm around halfway through at 7 played?). The novelty of seeing what's next is a big part of what makes it compelling, but the art is amazingly cute and the play over all is satisfying. 

Works pretty well at 2p, some cards just become less valuable

The legacy aspect of Fabled Fruit is the most interesting thing about it, particularly since it is achieved without permanently altering the game or revealing things that cannot be forgotten.  A game of Fabled Fruit is an optimisation exercise in a shifting world of card powers and varieties of sets to be collected.   It's fine but I feel no pressing need to see what more the deck has to offer.

The artwork might have come from a cheery book of animal tales for children and production quality is good.

Fabled Fruit turned out to be exactly what I was hoping it would be.  It's a fantastic family game that is highly competitive, constantly evolving, and so quick to play that fitting in a couple more games of it isn't a problem.  That's a good thing, because we never want to play this just once!

As a bonus, it's super easy to setup and tear down.  Since I typically do this by myself, this is a huge benefit!

After 23 plays (3 player) we completed our first run through all the cards.

Very simple filler-weight card game that is incredibly easy to learn. The playing field changes not only from game-to-game but also during the game, requiring you to adapt as players purchase the available cards. Unfortunately there are a number of times where you look at the cards available and find there's really nothing interesting to do.

This Game uses set collection of fruit cards to purchase location cards. The first player to the preset number of purchased location cards wins.  There is however a limited number of each location card, which are replaced with a new one after every purchase.  Each new location card set unlocks a new action/ability, which makes the game progressive for prolonged playability and replay ability.

I've really been enjoying the faux-campaign of this light set-collection game from FF.

Zoomed in to a single game there's nothing too special here...particularly in the early going when all the actions are pretty standard.  

Watching the game change as you play multiple rounds is pretty satisfying tho.  Of course the main hook of the game is this one little novelty (so far).  I dunno how many times I would want to play through it but so far I have more fun with this than I did with Pandemic Legacy.

The downside is that many of the card actions seems kinda dumb.  It's not uncommon to have an array of several actions that look really sweet and several that just seem useless.  Sometimes new actions come into play that validate older (seemingly useless) cards and it's neat when that happens.

A word of advice.  Always count the total number of cards in play before picking up where you left off.  I find myself constantly forgetting to add new cards into the mix and that can leave you playing with fewer options...which is less fun!

Fabled Fruit is a game almost purely about mechanics. Even though the base conceit of set collection is very simple, new mechanics are constantly introduced while others fade away. Getting the most cards is usually the best way to win, but the farther you get into the deck, the more the game becomes about not letting your opponents win instead.

There are a lot of Take That actions that can really screw up even the best laid plans and cause big swings, but I wouldn't call Fabled Fruit competitive or tense in the slightest - It's a very casual, lighthearted way to experience a multitude of boardgame mechanics in a very short playtime.

After "completing" the game, I have to say that I was hoping for a bit more from the actions of the last ten or so cards; It felt like the game dwindled a bit towards the end. The strongest part of the game is definitely in the mid phase, with cards ranging from about #15 to #35. 

Therefore, I'm bringing my final score down to an 8. Still a great game that I'd heartily recommend for pretty much anyone.

Amusant legacy spelletje.
Je moet fruit verzamelen voor de juiste combi fruitsappen.
Ondertussen doe je acties,  waarbij je ook interactie met de anderen verkrijgt.  (Soms ook kaarten afnemen, doch weinig aggressief).
Na eerste speling best wel enthousiast, ook eens met Himaya spelen.

Veel verschillende actiekaarten, maar die komen pas in het spel naarmate het spel vele keren hebt gespeeld (legacy karakter)

After learning the rules to this game I was a bit underwhelmed. It seemed very simplistic and almost like a game targeted at kids.

But after we started playing, it quickly showed its strengths.
With every successful buy the "board" (24 center cards) changes a bit — actions will be bought up and vanish while new (and more interesting) actions show up.

The rules say to save your progress (separately pack the already bought actions and the current board). With this the game has kind of a legacy aspect to it.
The genius part is that this legacy concept isn't restricted to the same group at all. You can pull this game out with any group and advance the available actions. And when players return at a later time they ma discover a whole bunch of new actions they didn't know before – very interesting and open implementation of a legacy system.

I played Fabled Fruit at the Dice Tower Con. In my one and only quick game, it seemed like a nice filler with nothing incredibly innovative or extraordinary. 

Then again, I did not try the legacy aspect and I'm wondering if that adds some gameplay or depth that I'm not seeing. Anyways, it seems like a fun and light game to introduce to non-gamers or family.

I love how Friese brings new ideas to our hobby. He definitely pushes the envelope in game design. Fabled Fruit is an ultra simple game rules-wise and the art makes it look like the game is intended for families. I think the game would work for families and it might appeal to gamers who are okay with a lighter game too. Basically, you move your animal to a location and either take the action at that location or spend fruit to obtain a fabled juice. If you move to an occupied location then you pay fruit to the player(s) there already. When you get a fabled juice, you take the location card and flip it over and draw the top location card from the deck. Each location has 4 cards, so new ones appear and old ones eventually disappear. When the next game starts, you use the same set up that you finished with.

It's very clever and it really seems to work. I can see that player targeting and sequencing of turns will affect the game play. For a light game like this, that's fine with me. I will add this one to my collection and play it a bunch more.

RATING: 4
As dry and unattractive as you’d expect, Fabelsaft is the perfect example of a good concept (the Legacy-soft stock of cards) with nothing else around to support it: playing it is curious at first, then becomes repetitive quickly and boring soon after.

Gameplay can be summarized as grinding as many cards as you can until you meet the requirements to acquire a location, collect three locations to win; repeat the same process ad infinitum, with requirements changing slightly as older cards are replaced by newer.
The one element of interest (and the one where its Legacy-soft dubbing comes from) is you never refresh the locations as a new game starts but keep using the same array you had when the previous game ended.

Legacy-soft element apart, this is how an unimaginative filler plays but Fabelsaft isn’t a filler: it’s way too cerebral for being one and also lacks in interaction, apart from figuring out how to nag the leader, which on the contrary might even backfire and help him instead.

This game started out very strong with my wife and I but now that we are more than half way through the deck it has slowed down quite a bit.

15 games in or so, this hasn't quit held up as well as I would have expected. Although the format of rules throughput (instead of constant rules additions) is better than Legacy, it has some of the same issues - namely, it's hard to keep a game going consistently over such a long time with so many changes. Just like Risk and Pandemic Legacy, it hits spots where the combos aren't working all that well or the game environment is a little uninteresting, but without the narrative hook it's a little harder to power through the lulls. On the other hand, it's much easier to get back into after a break; once Risk Legacy lost us, it was gone (in fairness, the games are not really directly comparable, but still).

Anyway, I still like this quite a bit, but it hasn't quite delivered on the format yet. As usual, I'm curious to see where Friedemann goes with this. He's become one of the most interesting designers currently working in this "euro" space, if not the most interesting, with his early-career unreliability behind him and now entering a phase of maturity and professionalism.

The 5-player version is not ideal. You can do it and it works fine, but 3 or 4 is better.

---

This is light-ish, and I don't usually have a ton of time for light games, but it was really just super-fun. The play is fast, the powers of all the cards work in interesting ways, it has a nice balance of chaos and planning. All the animals and fruits are cute and fun, and the illustrations and graphic design are great. We're not deep into the deck of cards yet, but so far the "Saga" format is great; even after just a few plays the game is changing in noticeable and interesting ways pretty quickly - you really need to stay flexible as some of the powers are specialized but strong. Anyway, not deep into it yet, but high hopes.

I want to gush about how good this game is.  It is simple, but so much fun, and it is great that it constantly changes, game to game, so your strategy has to change accordingly.  Not my best game of 2016, but coming in at #3 is still very respectable with such a strong year, especially with how simple the gameplay is.  Very interested in future plays and getting that chance to discover where the game goes.  Also interested to see if the replayability still holds once the game gets reset to cards #1 through #6.  But I still think getting 20 - 25 plays out of a game is more than enough.

There was no tension when choosing your action each turn as we never seemed to get in each other's way. It felt obvious as to which action I should pick, so there was no decision angst either. It was balanced enough that the scores were all near identical throughout the game with one person inching ahead of others to victory.

To make it worse, unlike a legacy game, there is no connection between game N and game N+1. When playing game N+1 it doesn't matter at all what happened in the previous game. Who won. What they bought. Totally meaningless. And I felt no excitement over what's coming up next. The cards were so bland that I felt that whatever the next card was, I'd simply be treated to be more dullness.

- thief is placed next to the locations
- 5 fruit tokens are placed in the pool

Fabled Fruit is such a unique concept for a game. My first thoughts on this so far are really great and I've rated it a 7.75. I loved the different take on a legacy game by being a fable game. You don't ever permanently alter the game so you can easily restart whenever you want to and it's as good as new. They even give you a spot on the back of the explanation book to log different games with other groups since they will end up slightly different. Being able to work through the game is really great too because it eases you into it before there are more complicated ones. 

We played this just as two players and it worked out really well. The piles didn't get depleted that fast since it was just us two but the game flowed really smoothly. We both had never played it but caught on really fast since the rules are just a page long. 

So far we have only made it to the 9th juice but it was a good game and I'm eager to play it again. I can't wait to see what else is in that big pile of cards.

Introduced this with a group of casual gamers and it was an instant success: It's easy to learn, easy to explain and everyone got into the game quickly. There are choices to make but they don't feel overwhelming. Be aware that this is a game where you interfere with other player's cards (and plans) by stealing, blocking, forced trading etc. Not everybody likes this in a game, especially among the more casual gamers this is often a turn-off.

Fabled Fruit is the new hit at our family table! We are at card 15 in the fabled deck. works great with five.

Kids love the theme, gathering fruits an picking animals etc. It’s quite lite but  games changes so you’re not playing the same game over and over again which is usually the problem with kids games. So the game is interesting for adults also, a big plus there!

On the downside there are a lot of rules to explain but luckily it comes in bits. So I be like “Be quite for a minute daddy is trying to (translate and) explain a new rule”.. 

Two kids in the family are younger than eight so I have to help them by explaining the option they have, but they are able to make their own choices. So lots of family fun there or for adults if are in the mood for a lighter game experience.

By the way It isn’t a legacy game because it’s not permanently changed. You can reset the deck of cards at any time.

RATING: 10
It's explained in a heartbeat, it doesn't take long to play a round, it changes over time, it has a great amount of content and you get lots of gameplay with big components of great quality for a relatively low price.

I don't see many connections between the theme and the gameplay (most notably the actions) and some cards are simply unattractive (in terms of choices to make) or only make sense with four or five players.

But that is not enough for me to give it a score lower than 10 of 10. My family loves it too!

Fabulosa Fructus est un jeu de cartes basé sur un univers original : les animaux de la forêt se disputent pour élaborer les meilleurs jus de fruits. Si le matériel répond agréablement aux standards actuels, l'intérêt est ailleurs : les parties s'enchainent au fil d'une campagne où les règles de jeu se transforment au gré des cartes nouvellement introduites. Ainsi, les stratégies évoluent constamment, apportant une dynamique appréciable.

Fun, which gets more fun the more you play. Make sure not to judge this one on one play...you need the more complex card interactions of later games to make it shine.

RATING: 7.1
Players try to mix three fruit juices by collecting the right set of cards to do so. The game starts with 6 different juice cards (4 of each type). These juice cards show a combination of fruit cards necessary to buy the juice card (and score 1 of the 3 points needed for victory) + they each represent an action field. The players have to place their worker (animal) on 1 of the cards. Then they can execute the action or they can buy the card. Actions are all linked to the taking of fruit cards. Each time a juice card is bought, a new juice card is added. These new juice cards introduce new actions.

I don't get how the legacy aspect adds to the gameplay that a randomized setup doesn't do just as well. Didn't preview all the later cards but the one I saw didn't indicate any ramp up but having not seen all the cards, I can't fully comment.

Basic resource management with tactical worker placement to get the most resource cards per turn in order to pay for the cards placed later. Though it is in cards, the hand management is non existent as there's no hand limit. Lots of worker placement/fabled fruit card effects for variety in play.

It's a light set collection game where you have different powers you can select from. The key is that each game only 6 powers are displayed and will remain until you use them all and the next game is setup from the previous card stacks, meaning the game continues between plays (the fable system). Personally, it's no more compelling than the randomizer system from Trains - every game has different powers to vary play. It doesn't deliver on a deep campaign or legacy play like was suggested by the description of the game. Would play again with younger gamers but not really a game that fits my style.

Fun, chaotic, breezy filler that took about 15 minutes of card flinging to play to completion.  I felt like I was going through the motions, hoping to have a shot at victory.  Felt a little phoned in, with not a lot there.  Cute to look at though.  Not sure what to think at the moment.  

After two games with five players, still don't know what to think, but I strongly suspect yet another FF game where the ideas are interesting the design is not quite finished.  Getting a couple rules incorrect didn't help.  Possibly a great family game.

After two more games, rebooted, with three players and the correct rules, it feels much better.  Five feels too chaotic and tight, but three allows a little wriggle room, a longer game and more opportunity to "play the game".   Very good with the family.

RATING: 8
This is a really good set collection game, with a fantastic campaign system backing it up.

The fundamentals of the system are fine; taking cards with different actions, each with varying degrees of interactivity. But each card that comes out shifts this, either a lot or a little, and you go from looking for very small advantages to huge hands of cards and attempts to be the first to get access to game-changing spaces. New cards  that come out really make the game sing.

But the game never feels random or unfair with the new card distribution -each upcoming card is previewed face-up before it comes out, so you know exactly what your opponents will be able to do. There's randomness in the fruit cards you take, of course, but that's just fitting the game into the appropriate weight class.

I've never played a Legacy game, so I have no idea to what degree it emulates that experience. But viewed as its own thing, it's definitely worth your time. Highly recommended.

Works well as a filler with some wide variation in the mechanisms that are used to collect sets.   Feels like it has some legs in that regard.   I'm not convinced that a "Fable Game" is really a thing.   Putting cards in a sequence is not a thing.   Presentation and production are nice.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
When you read the rules of Fabled Fruit you might exclaim “Is that it?!”. But fear not, Friedmann Friesse has struck gold again with this idea. This is a simplified Legacy concept (hear called a ‘Fable’ concept) in the way that the game evolves each time you play it. Essentially you are collecting sets and you play initially with 6 piles of 4 cards, each pile offering a place for your worker to land and do the action. New piles of cards come into the game as you go along, offering new and sometimes improved and interactive actions. The next time you play the game, you reset it with the piles of cards which were in play when you left off.

Stripped of the marketing around the ‘fable’ concept, in reality it plays out each time a little like a game of Dominion would if you slowly changed the set of increasingly complex Kingdom cards each time you play. 

Despite the simplicity the game actually works really well. As a one-off game it is fairly underwhelming, good but not amazing, but what draws you back time after time is the interest and excitement about what cards are coming next, what interesting dynamics are going to be thrown into the game this week.

Impressed.

My family is enjoying playing through this game (4 players). Basic actions are super simple. The cards have specific actions. Old cards will be retired and new cards appear, so the game gradually introduces new rules, which helps. The are some very interesting card interactions.

2017-11-05 : First play. In essence this is an action selection game where what actions are available changes from game to game and also within a single game. This has the drawback that certain action-card combinations will turn up that make the game totally uninteresting by narrowing the decision space i.e. there's usually only 1 or 2 actions in your turn that make any sense, so you pick them. This was highly visible in our game. The result is that the game is playing you and in a somewhat competent group, all players will manage to acquire about the same number of cards / points. To make this at least somewhat exciting, a low granularity system of point scoring is used - if pretty much all the players get their second point around about the same time, it becomes a race to determine who gets that third, but that's more about luck than anything else. Maybe my expectations were just too high, but as it is there's just not enough game in this one

Fabled Fruit is a light and cute family weight 2-5 player set collection and worker placement game with some ‘take that’ that usually comes in the form of stealing fruit cards from your opponents. You are trying to collect specific sets of fruit that then lets you turn them into delicious combinations of juices at locations in the forest manned by a questionable collection of animals. The location cards are ‘multi-use’ in the sense that you can use them as a location to visit the animal in question to get a benefit (usually more cards), or to turn in your fruit at that location to make the juice of that location, and when you’ve made your juice, you take the card and flip it face down in front of you to represent the juice you’ve made and there is a handy bottle depicted on the back. First player to 5 fruit juices in a 2 player game wins!

I rate this an [b][BGCOLOR=#00FF66]8[/BGCOLOR][/b] because in addition to having a quick playing time, it's fun to see what locations are coming out next, and interesting to see how they interact with the locations already present. Even though in several parts of the game it only [i]just[/i] about works with 2 players because either it's too wide open so we have lots of uncontested options, or too tight because some locations are only relevant or more beneficial in a multi-player game (in addition to which some locations are quite obviously miles better than others), and even though it has a fairly high level of 'take that' which neither of us really care for, it is cute and fast enough not to overstay its welcome.

However, in actuality it really should be a [BGCOLOR=#00FFCC][b]7[/b][/BGCOLOR] for us. It's not really its strongest at 2 players, and no modifications have been made for a 2 player game other than playing to 5 fabled juices. It is quite a nice game with 2, not broken as such, but to get the full effect of the tension of the game by having to pay your competition to go to locations you desperately need adds a whole other layer. 
I wanted to get through the locations faster so I removed one card from each of the locations and that worked nicely for us with starting and maintaining an 18 card location set out on the table. It didn't seem to disrupt any balances in the game at all. We are now up to location #51. Despite touting all unique locations, many locations feel very similar so you get a deja vu feeling every so often. 

All in all I am having fun with it and I really like seeing the subtle shifts in the game with the different locations in play, but my gaming partner is not keen on it, and after playing it all the way through I might not get a chance to play through it again.

See my review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1860058

The bottom line: "Fabled Fruit has to be considered another Friedemann Friese triumph. Without the fable mechanic, the game would eventually wear out its welcome. But by means of his fable mechanic which generates constantly changing and new options, Friedemann Friese has successfully reinvented the filler, giving it a sense of replayability in a way that hasn't really been seen before. He's injected new life into the familiar mechanics of worker placement and set collection by combining them with his fable mechanic, which makes each successive game feel new, forcing you to adapt your strategies even within a single game. Perhaps best of all, it's remarkable that he's accomplished this not in a complex gamer's game, but in a family-friendly filler. Fabled Fruit is easy to learn, and yet has enough variety and decisions to keep you coming back to it, with constantly new things to discover and explore. It takes real genius to produce a simple game that gives enjoyment to non-gamers and families, but is so engaging that it can even keep gamers returning to it for more at the same time."

Excelente juego, simple, con condiciones de reglas cambiantes, que lo hace muy interesante y diferente cada partida.

This is a very enjoyable game, and the "programmed learning" structure is great.  The first day I learned it, I played it 4 times.

I would like to find a group that will play it a dozen times, either in one session or in several sessions over time, to see how the "fable" concept works in that context.

It's almost too simple, but you really want to know what the remaining cards in the deck are, so that's a good sign; you want to play again to explore the deck:)
I don't know if I like that all cards have almost equal purchase price, and that each card is worth 1 point. It might be better if the cards were more asymmetric, but maybe they will be visible in future plays. Therefore, rating might go up:)
I am afraid that the scoring system results in tiebreakers too often.
But I like the game. It creates a relaxing and good atmosphere around the table, and the special actions on each card are interesting enough.

Gameplay itself is very simple and I do like that the cards get more complex and more interactive as the game progresses but still simple enough that my daughter has been able to play along with us, otherwise it's a pretty standard set collection game

As is often the case with Friese games, Fabled Fruit has artistic value in the attempt to put a new spin on another zeitgeist topic, this time 'legacy light'. The underlying game, however, is a pretty dull set collection exercise with the overarching question "where do I get the most cards." It's playable but in spite of the slowly changing rules doesn't manage to hold my interest for very long. The desire to play again - if you can call it that - is driven by curiosity about the coming cards rather than an expectation of a good game. Which might be clever from a marketing point of view but certainly isn't sustainable.

Nobody should judge this game until getting to at least card 15 in the deck. This game changes CONSIDERABLY, so much so that your first round may take 20 minutes, but after the mid part of the deck, the choices are much more compelling and complex. There is also an addictive quality to this game in which you are constantly wanting to see what new locations come out, which increases replayability. There is so much game here, it will take you 18-20 plays to get through the deck, which for us, has taken us the better part of a year to get through, so there is definite longevity to this game. A great filler, a great game.

Fabled Fruit is a very simple worker placement game at first, but as you play it will evolve. New options and mechanics are introduced.

It's called the "Fable" system and I would love to see applied to many other games because there's consequences to each gameplay session, we're looking forward to all we haven't seen and we're not damaging our game in the progress .

With 5p, the beginning of the campaign (only six actions out) was so tense that it was minorly magical. And discovering new game systems, also pretty fun, okay.

On the other hand, by the end of that first play the board was feeling NOT tense at all, which I would think is much more common (because usually the 24 available cards are in more than 6 stacks, and because you might play with fewer than five players) and that wasn't really as fun. Deciding whether to commit to the whole campaign: therefore, difficult.

Great game. Very enjoyable, even with two. Many dislike the game with 2 because there are certain cards that work better with larger groups. I would look at this as a tightening factor. The cards that aren't as desirable actually tighten up the board to make decisions tougher. Also, I really like the Fable system, even though it's similar to the Legacy system and it does seem simplistic. Could you use this same system with Dominion cards... maybe, but it wasn't designed for that purpose. As you play through the game, certain cards round out other cards. When one card exits the game, another one is up on deck to spice things up. This is why I think the fable system deserves some acknowledgment. It's wonderful. Really excited about the other fable games coming. Another fantastically innovative game by a great designer.

Fabled Fruit is another unique design from the Green Man, which is a simple set collection to VP game with a twist.

I love Friedeman's games for their original ideas, and look forward to playing this one more.

Feels more of a set collection delivery/contract fulfillment game than worker placement. Although you do the action of the space your one pawn is at, so it shares that aspect I suppose?

Rules are simple and play is fairly quick. You only see the first 8 cards the first time you play, and from there you theoretically would do the next game with where you left off, so new cards would slowly trickle in.

RATING: 6
Light "Legacy" type of game with the worker placement spots changing over time as the game is played across multiple sessions. I remember the designer said the game can be played at least 20 sessions before you completely get through the entire deck of cards. The game is all about collecting resources and converting them to 'juices' with a smattering of cards that allows you to steal and interact with other players differently. 

While I was in awe of the evolving game at first, it soon felt too repetitive for me and much too light for my taste. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After having played about two-thirds of the way through the game's card types, I've decided that Fabled Fruit's biggest problem is that the parade of new cards, while offering new possibilities and variety, never introduce much real strategy beyond "do this action and hope the random events occur in your favor." And since it's a legacy game, it loses the big advantage of fast, simple games as it isn't meant to be played with different players. I'll finish the campaign out of courtesy and curiosity of what cards are left, but I don't see myself revisiting the game past that.

Great filler game with the twist of having a long campaign. This game was a bigger hit than I expected when I recently brought it out for the first time. We only got through two rounds, but we're already looking forward to adding this to the end of our game nights going forward until we get all the way through card #59. Really great concept and I'm looking forward to whatever Friedemann Friese adds next to his fabled line of games.

RATING: 6
This game consists primarily of two decks of cards - a location deck and a fruit deck. There are 60 locations with four cards for each location. Each location is an action space and the first six are laid out to start your first game. On your turn you place your piece on a location and collect fruit cards, trade with other players, trade with the draw pile, or trade and collect in many other ways as the game evolves. Also when you go to a location, you can turn in a set of fruit and collect the location. When a location is collected, another location card comes into play. If it is the first card of a particular number, it makes another action available to the players. In this way, slowly, the actions available to the players evolves over many plays. You store the current locations, past locations and future locations in separate bags so that you can easily reset the game state from one game to the next. The first player to collect 4 locations wins any particular game.

The evolution of action fields is a compelling device. The main reason I would ever be drawn back to this game is to see what actions come up, but my issue is that I want the game play to draw me back, not just the curiosity of seeing what the next action will be. I've played far enough in that I feel pretty confident that the game won't really become more compelling to me with the right mix of actions, but if you enjoy swapping, stealing, trading and drawing cards in order to build sets, this is a pure expression of those mechanics with a cool evolution of actions that will keep you coming back.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There is a lot of buzz around this game, and I certainly see why. The promise of an evolving game is very cool. It's a clever system that allows the slow introduction of rules, and the slow removal of rules as well. If I had a casual group of gamers to experience this with I would be more excited.

The gameplay didn't grab me at all. Try to collect the right fruits to turn in for juice. First to X juice wins. The cards allow for a variety of actions, many of which are quite interactive adding to the general chaos.

Like [thing=175878][/thing] the system is amazing, I just don't care much for the gameplay. Although I think the gameplay is better here, it's just not my type of game.

RATING: 8
Friese's successful take on the legacy system. His two innovations are applying the system to a filler card game and making it replayable when done. Choosing to combine legacy + filler is genius. While fillers tend to have limited replayability and serve as just a filler, Fabled Fruit is one of the few filler games I want to replay immediately to see how it develops.

Luck plays an important role, it has some spiteful cards, the coarse-grained victory condition combined with the start player advantage doesn't leave room for subtlety. It's probably best with at least four players. Still, really good as a short fun game. Don't get fooled by the childish look and the big box though as both these impressions are misleading.

Na początku wydawała się zbyt prosta, ale tak było tylko przy pierwszej partii. Gdy zaczynają pojawiać się nowe karty staje się jasne, że trzeba już troszkę pokombinować. Bardzo przyjemna gra, wiele kart, bardzo przyjemna wizualnie. Podobają mi się zwierzaczki narysowane na kartach, przemawiają do mnie bardzo. Uprzyjemnia mi to rozgrywkę. Jedyny zarzut mam do jednego z animeepli - zielonego stworka, który moim zdaniem powinien być żółwiem, a jest chyba hipopotamem :P Ale czy ktoś widział kiedyś zielonego hipopotama? Mógł być jeszcze nosorożcem (jest na okładce gry - ale nie ma rogu, więc nope, to nie jest nosorożec). Z ciekawostek - na okładce gry nie ma ani żółwia ani hipopotama. Co za mind fuck! ;)

Pretty simple hand management, action selection game.
I do hope later animals offer more exciting options though. Right now it was a slow dropout race to see who would be the ones to first make a mistake and cost them the game.

Think it would be really fun with a set group though. Seeing the game shift tone over time + the whole meta groupthink aspect sounds great.

RATING: 7
Every time I've gotten this to the table people have really liked it, it's got some 'take that' to the gameplay, but it's never too bad that players are annoyed. The evolving action spaces from game to game make it a treat to dive further into the game because it changes so much when the simple introductory action spaces are all gone and you get ones that really change to game. A filler game with a sort of legacy element, plays quickly and really shines at 4 or 5 players. It's basically a worker placement and set collection game, but trying to make the most of the available actions each game is what makes it great, sort of akin to how you try to find the best synergy with each set of Dominion cards.

RATING: 6
Okay game of set collection by visiting different location cards to use the related action to either draw cards or get them from other players.  The novelty of new card locations coming out gives the game a bit of a curiosity factor.  Some of the locations entail trading or taking cards from other players which I can forsee being mildly annoying.  

This game was on my potential buy list but I'm glad I had the chance to try it first because it has now been removed from that list.  However, I am willing to play the game again, I just don't see it worth owning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Overall this is a fine family game. Introducing new cards and rules through multiple play sessions makes teaching the game very easy and does offer more depth and variety than initially apparent. I did, however, find the pace at which these news rules are introduced very slow.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

A group of four decided to try it out of curiosity. I sure hope there are more interesting decisions and game play elements later in the location deck since the first game is pretty boring. We all finished with 3 fruits and the tiebreaker came into play which seems weak. Hopefully, there will be more differentiation moving forward. Will try this with my student staff and see how it goes.

RATING: 6
A simple set collection game where each card has a different power and can be turned into a juice.  You collect fruits until you can get a juice.  Once you have juice, you pay your fruits and take the card adding a new card to the tableau.  There are always 24 cards but may be more than 6 types since the new juice eliminates the old card.  There are huge stacks of cards in the game and it can be played over time.  This continues until you have 3 juices.  Winner gets 2 points, loser gets nothing and all other players get 1 point.

A single game is fun and you can play a set of games in one session.  Card art if very good and fun.  I don't know if the game is good as a "legacy" game.  If someone gets out ahead by getting lucky, how to the other people catch up?  The numbers are not going to be that swingy and luck can factor into the win.

Fabled Fruit is a simple card game that changes over time as players buy the drink card, its action is no longer available and replaced by another action card. It plays quickly, has simple rules, and remains fresh with this new Fabled concept. No need to permanently destroy the game, how smart is that?

Very good light game that benefits from being played "best out of 3" (or even 5). Although there's only one action to take on your turn, it does feel like there's proper decisions to be made - though there are some that just seem too obvious if they are available.

Single game is quite easy. What is beautiful is that from game to game meta changes and you can see players going from "OH! Thats easy! I will do that" to "Oh gosh, my strategy don't work anymore. What to do, what to do?!" in few seconds. And then again in next game it changes slightly.

Very cool card game based on an alternate "legacy" system. I really enjoy this game, however, the scoring could be significantly more interesting. We almost never play by ending the game when a certain number of "juice" cards have been bought. We either go until a much larger predetermined card count is met...or until a point value is met. For example, we award points based on the card numbers.

At first I dismissed this as a simple gateway game with little depth. It was true, for the first few games. The cards you could go to were pretty straightforward, like "draw 2 fruits" or "exchange 1 banana for 2 fruits". But later it picked up tension when the more nuanced and interactive cards were introduced. I like discovering what the new animals can do, and the game play has gained some depth.

This is hard to rate on a single play since I only played the base placements (plus 2-3 more) and it ended up being an extremely close game.  So this rating is very tentative and does not reflect the whole range of things that happen in this game.

A very good family game. The "legacy" element is done well and has an almost addictive quality to it. My kids in particular get excited each time a new animal card comes into play. Another nice thing about the fable system is that the game starts extremely simple and introduces additional complexity as it goes (though admittedly, the game will never be mistaken for anything but light). This makes it easier to introduce to more casual gamers.

The players try to fulfill different recipes of fruit cocktails by collecting the right ingredients. These are collected, exchanged and swapped using a variety of 6 to 8 action cards in the middle of the table.

RATING: 9
Very neat game. For something that feels like a cross between Splendor and Harbour, I found Fabled Fruit to be very unique. On one hand, there are a ton of different card combinations, so the possibilities are nearly endless. On the other hand, the game isn't really designed to allow you to just grab a bunch of stacks at random. You're instead expected to play through a series of games where the cards you purchase change the state of the game from session to session. It's a neat idea, but I can't honestly see too many people playing this way. I wish that there was a variant to play with randomized card stacks. There also seems to be a bit of a disconnect on what you're supposed to do once you reach the end of the available cards. Still, this is a game I look forward to exploring further. It's on the simpler side, but I can see this being a lot of fun to return to time and time again. If I still owned Harbour or Splendor, this would have fired both games for me.

RATING: 4
Fabled Fruit is a simple set collection game where you place animals and claim fruits to be able to mix juices. It has its fun moments but the decisions are simple (where do I get most fruits?), the interaction accidental (who seems to be in the lead and should be bashed?) and the victory margins small (with most fruits as tie-breakers). For a filler game, there are shorter and deeper alternatives.

In this legacy card game, players are collecting wine. Before you can make the wine, you move your token to a location to acquire fruits (collect 2 fruits, trade in fruits, etc). If you move to a location where someone already is, you have to pay them a fruit. Once you have enough fruits you can get a wine from the location, which brings in a new location, which has other special powers.  The game ends afer someone has collected a number of wines. You can play this legacy by removing the collected wines and drilling through the new locations. 

It plays decent, and it is fun to explore the different locations.  Each game plays reasonably quick, and it depends on your mood if you want to keep playing it as a legacy game. It is imaginative, and not too taxing on you.

Very good as an introductory worker placement game for the whole family. The "legendary-like" idea of the evolving "fabled" game play works well and makes for some eager anticipation which additional option will be offered by the next card. In most games, there seems to be an advantage for the starting player as some cards are often (much) better than others. However, that will likely only matter to experienced gamers and less to the target audience.

Another triumph for Friese in stripping out important (and trendy) mechanics and paring them right back to essentials. This is the Legacy format (yeah, I know it claims not to be, but it is) put into a context friendly enough to play with the folks but still substantial enough to make a games night filler. The cleverness with so little is apparent as soon as the card turnover starts and the various fruits in the game begin to acquire different strengths. I'm not convinced I'd want to play with with fewer than 4, though.

[b]Fabled Fruit[/b] was traded away in a math trade 1/21/18. (Received Evolution: Climate)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]6 (2 as a 2p game)[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Everyone besides my daughter and I bailed on this game. I would've jumped ship too, but my daughter wanted to finish playing through all of the animal cards. Right off the top I can't understand anyone recommending this game for two players; the further you get into the deck the more obvious it becomes that Fabled Fruit is best with four or five players. Most of the cards offer much better/more interesting effects if there are more players. Since the majority of my plays were with two, most of our games were an uninspired race to the finish. With more players it would've been more fun, but still not a game I'd want to play. Too many of the cards are just a variation on a theme and the gameplay an extremely light and straightforward. A huge pass for me.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]If you remove the hype surrounding this game (mostly from the publisher) you'll find an excellent intro/family weight worker placement game. This is a very light game, but if you know that going in you'll have a very enjoyable 20 minute gaming experience. The art and production are top notch and since the game is so quick you'll be tempted to play a few games in a row.The changing deck of cards offer plenty of opportunities to discover some clever combos which constantly change as new cards enter the game [i](right now we are up to card #20 after 5 plays). While the fabled system might not be the next milestone in game design, I enjoy it much more than the legacy style games and look forward to what the next game will be in this series.

I'd recommend this for families looking for a very satisfying 20 minute game that is very easy to teach as most of the rules are on the cards. I'd recommend it for kids 8+ due to the amount of reading necessary.[/i]

Much simpler than I expected for a pseudo-legacy game. Really, it's no different from any other game of card effect ilk. There's a collection of cards available with powers. Use those powers to get currency cards as fast as possible. Hope to draw currency cards in the sets you need to buy things (ie get lucky). Buy things as fast as possible (which will eventually seed new powers into the game). And before you know it, the game's over. The only new idea is that you start the next game with the card powers you ended up with at the end of the current game. It's easy enough to play, but I was expecting more. Each recent Friese game I've played lately has been of similar form - interesting idea, but game-play less than hoped. It's fast and harmless enough to allow replay, so as to see where it takes us, but we're hoping it develops more interesting decision making.

RATING: 6.5
This game started off as a 5 for me but the cards definitely get more interesting as you progress through the deck. It makes for a fun, dynamic game. I would like to see the actions come out faster but that also means they would leave the game faster so I'm sure Mr. Friese balanced out those two things best he could.

I played it a couple of times and did not go through the complete deck.

Fabled Fruit is a contract-fulfillment card game with an ever-shifting tableau of special abilities. Ability cards are numbered from 1 to 59, and feature both a way to get more fruit and a cost to claim as a point. When any card is claimed, the next card numerically comes out, with new abilities coming out every four cards. On their turn, players can place their token on a card either to use the special ability or claim it; the first player to claim five wins. While it certainly is interesting to see what new abilities become available (if you don't peek ahead), the gameplay itself is fairly bland. Seeing various abilities interact, and fruit becoming more or less valuable because of abilities and costs is interesting, but I wonder if the set order is strictly necessary. This filler is more interesting because of discovery than gameplay.

Very simple game that changes dynamics as the game progresses. It makes it interesting to see what cards you can kill and others that you may want to keep. I want to see where the cards go. Looks like it'll be a bit more interesting with 3-4 players. 2 was fine and quick, but a lot less interaction. I worry 5 might be a bit much, but who knows?

One that has quite impressed me even though it has the most ridiculous theme. It may rise one more point, but I do think the excitement might ween a bit once I've seen the entire game. Overall, I can't wait to keep playing.

Edit: Goofed up one thing (added the 10 extra double cards into the deck), although I don't think it changed the dynamic of the game. I do want to go back and fix it now, but maybe with a different group.

A breezy game that'd be good for a vacation on the beach.

I enjoy the 'fable' concept (reset-able and non-destructive legacy), though I'll probably put this up for auction after playing through the deck once (which will take awhile!).

My wife and I frequently tie, or come close to a tie in this game, which leaves me wondering if my choices actually matter much. 

Pairs well with a mimosa.

This game is light and plays quickly so one should not expect too much from any one play of the game. However, the constantly evolving selections of actions/cards keeps me coming back for more. If this game were just a single set of cards I'd probably play it half dozen times at most then move on. But with the new cards constantly entering the game, I have no doubt that I'll play it through to the end (on track for approximately 23 games) and could very well start over for another run.

Games I do not play often are worker placement or set collection.  This combines both genres in an enjoyable blend and tremendously improves the whole shebang with the Fable (legacy) framework.

Set collection, worker placement. Light quick filler, straightforward to teach.
"Fabled", legacy-light system where the game changes each time you play and quite dramatically as you progress deeper through the deck and increase in complexity; different cards (actions) come into play from the large master deck, slowly cycle through them over many plays.
-May not play as well with 2, some 'take-that' actions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fast game, where players compete to be the first to collect three cards. You collect the cards by set matching a card that you place your worker on. It's a nice filler game, that refreshes itself by slowing adding new cards to use in the game, as old cards slowly work their way out as they get scored.

So it stays fresh and likely won't get boring after a few plays.

Absolutely the best game I've played from 2016 thus far.  The game is almost filler like but plays like a legacy game as the game evolves as you play game after game.  Nothing is permanent though so you can start from the beginning again with groups.  The game is simplistic with respect to core rules however, the location card powers are where the game gets interesting.  Buying these cards is a race and you must pay for them with fruit cards.  Manipulating your hand and others is what seems to be a key element to the game.  I've play three games with three and its just a blast to play.  I'm not sure what the theme is really but I'm glad the animal character are there as it adds to the light hearted filler feeling.  I'm not sure but there even seems to be a hidden market feel to this game too.  So much depth with respect to rules and its fun.

There is a luck factor that I would say is similar to poker in that sometime you just don't get the cards but that is why this is really a campaign game that must be prayed over dozens and dozens of times to mitigate the luck.

RATING: 9
Our initial impression wasn't great...lackluster cartoon animals doing basic card game actions? I'm so glad we stuck it out though - by the end of the second game we couldn't wait to see what came next. The best description I have for this game is that it's like playing five games of Dominion in a row, all at once. Or "like Harbour, only fun". Even though the actions are basic, the fact that they constantly change keeps you engaged and the mystery cards/actions still to come are perpetually exciting. We're down into the last 10 or so animals and have enjoyed every game! 

The Fable gimmick is nice, even if it is transparent. Each animal could have been its own deck and then each game you could select eight animals with two in reserve or something like that, but having them be a guided tour is much more fun. When we make it all the way through we might do random combinations but we've gotten plenty of enjoyment out of it as designed.

A simple worker placement game. However, the catch of the game is in how new worker placement locations get revealed as you progress through the game. The "fable" system allows for you to save your game and pick up from there for your next play through. I find that very interesting and have been trying to play this more and more to see what the future locations will offer. I will say that this game will play so much better with more than 2 players which is unfortunate for me since I mostly play with just my wife.

Frankly, the shift between games is so minor it is little more than mildly influential modular setup, not the kind of evolving dynamics and emergent interactions that I'd like to see.  Hopefully there will be other 'fable' games, but this one is pretty boring.

we're probably losing a lot of the nuance by playing it only 2-player. it's fairly simple and doesn't really seem to lend itself to cool, memorable plays-of-the-game. i assume we're going to finish sine my wife is still on board and i'm curious how it ends, but i think it may leave my collection after that. enjoyment of this game is likely to be highly dependent on the people you play with. could be a good for a series of cheap double-dates with wine, or as a nightly family game for kids. or, it could fall flat. i have to stress the tactical simplicity, set collection, hidden information, and moderate take-that. it's not un-fun, but there are plenty other "fable games" coming out around now which i expect to be an improvement over this.

RATING: 7
Light/filler card game, but fun to play and watch the "fable" system evolve, "legacy"-style without any permanent changes/destruction to game components. 

FWIW we played a complete 2-player campaign in a couple weeks, a total of 25 individual games. It only took a few minutes to then resort the 240 location cards so a new campaign can be begun.

Cute art.

But 2 annoying ergonomic problems:

1. Location cards are too big, and the box is too big (but not high enough!). They [i]could[/i] have arranged the box with a helpful storage system to make a long row of the location cards (like in a Magic/trading card long card box) segregated with 2 separators/dividers (current locations + future locations + purchased juices), but alas that is not possible (the box is not sufficiently high for the location cards to lie on their sides in a long row). Instead you get plastic bags to hold separate sets of cards which slide around loose with a bunch of air. :(

2. Also a big missed opportunity for the cards to have more helpful iconography instead of only text descriptions, which can become a bit inconvenient to read especially when there are many diverse new locations in play. It would have been helpful to put e.g. a Market icon on all cards relating to the Market, a Fruit Token icon on all cards relating to Fruit Tokens, etc. As it is, the game is highly language dependent, when some simple iconography could have helped non-native speakers grok or search the cards more quickly. They did print a little signpost with a "1 card" icon on it to show at a glance which cards let you draw 1 random card if you cannot do the card's special action, but they really missed an opportunity to put additional helpful icons for easily seeing cards affecting the Market, the monkey Thief, etc. :(

In the very first game I have experienced: someone always giving you a banana when you have a big hand, forcing you to give them your cards; someone going on the gambling card and always drawing 2 of the same fruit busting; someone going on the gambling card and always drawing 3 unique fruits making everyone groan - especially the gambler who always busted. In the second game, the market play gets interesting, and the more annoying cards which were spammed from the first round disappear, forcing everyone's strategy to change.

I'm looking forward to playing through the rest of the stack at least once. And I hope that no one breaks the game by eliminating our standard "draw 2 fruit" action!

I really like this game. It uses a new 'fable' system, which is really cool. You basically play through this giant deck of cards, but any one game will only use a very small amount of them. So you just keep playing over and over across multiple games until you get through them all. You will have many, many plays without seeing the same cards. I really enjoy it, and the theme and artwork are silly and cute. This is a good one.

A decent little filler game that’s going to have enough legs to bring to the table again and again as we work our way through it and then work our way through it again. Each little mini round takes about 10-15 minutes and once players are experienced you’ll find that the scores are close. I mean really close. I mean really, really close. We’re taking everyone with the same number of juice bottles  and fruit card ties galore close.

For all the rules changes and new combination ideas the game just isn’t really very exciting. It’s very clever, but also very family fair and social. I like it, but with the medium sized box I’d reach for Pi Mal Pflaumen or Abluxxen to take on holidays first. That said, you’ll probably get a lot more hours of Fabled Fruit play in before you get bored with it.

Potential to rise in my estimation as I explore it further - perhaps ideally with three players?

2-5 players.

A simple enough premise, this is a worker placement game, where the locations are stacks of up to four cards, each stack depicting a different animal (and action).  

The locations serve two purposes, one is to take the action as shown on the card, the second is to purchase the card and flip it in front of you for a point.  When a card is purchased it is out of the game and the next card from the stack is placed on the table, which, if it's a new animal, will offer a new action for selection.

My first session with the game involved five back-to-back plays as three veteran gamers were caught up with its charm and the ever changing field of options, and always wanting another go to see what appeared next.

Fabled Fruit is a proof-of-concept design which is fun for a lark. It's a basic set collection game in which players manipulate their cards in hand via a simplistic worker placement system. The novelty of the design lies in having old action slots permanently disappear and new ones open up as the game progresses.

The curiosity over what new element will be introduced next helps elevate an otherwise bland filler into something mildly interesting. It still stops short of being [i]really[/i] interesting though, as the bulk of  action slots only allow players to draw incremental numbers of fruits at any one time. Still, it's an ideal game to break out with the [thing=40398]Monopoly Deal[/thing]-loving crowd during a weekend, although the high cost is a bit of a setback.

Really enjoying the fable aspect of this game to save and pick up where you leave off to have a lengthy campaign.  One thing I'm noticing so far...with a 2 player game, it seems that whomever starts first always has won the game so far.  

Trend continues - almost broke the 2 player start = win trend, but not quite.  

Ok, now that we are higher up in the rule cards, we noticed that play is a bit faster, and you can more easily win whether you start 1st or not in a 2 player game.  Nifty!

My favorite game of 2016.  The ever changing market place of cards keeps the game feeling fresh even after 20+ plays. Ingenious design, but not sure I will want to play this again after my gaming group finishes playing through all the cards.  Even if that is the case this was still worth every penny and will highly recommend it to everyone.

I'm only one game in but it's already started adding mechanisms. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this game progresses. 

Update: five plays in now and while it doesn’t play as anything more than an entry point to worker placement games, it does keep the game fresh after multiple plays. Harder to get to the table in my group, though, as the rest want to see a more fleshed out core game.

[Swanpanasia 17 Edition] {Fantasy; set-collection, work-placement, epic; optimal 4-5p} Get this for my daughters.

I like Friedemann Friese.  His design is always refreshing.  Fabled Fruit is a fun and easy game for family to go on a journey.  The Fable System is innovative but it is not ground breaking: it seems only available actions are different each game.

The rule is simple.  A typical game is fast.  It is especially suitable for family so that we can play a short game after dinner and the game keeps evolving each play.  Thumb up for families.

Im Gegensatz zu den Vorgängerspielen von F. Friese erfrischend einfach und sehr schön illustriert.

Das Spiel ist sehr schnell gelernt und spielt sich nach zwei Minuten von selbst. 

Die Resonanz in meiner Gruppe ist durchwachsen. Die einen lieben es und die anderen finden den Mechanismus in Ordnung,  haben aber nicht die Muße alle Karten sehen zu wollen.

Persönlich finde ich es sehr gelungen und es macht Spaß. meine Empfehlung ist eine Spielgröße ab 3+ und Zeit das Spiel kennenzulernen.

Tries to be clever, sometimes is. Set collection, do you move to a card occupied by another player or go vacant, and that's pretty much it.

RATING: 6.8
tl;dr: pretty basic with a fun twist

This is a worker placement game where you gather resources that you can turn into VPs. We've seen this many times before. The fun twist is that the action spaces are printed on the cards that you turn into VPs. So you cycle through those and can even keep the ones from the end of the last game to start from where you left out.
That's a fun twist, but the game itself isn't all that special. It works very well though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Really interesting from a game design point of view; how the actions you can take and the recipes you're trying to collect are constantly in (gentle) flux as the game grows and develops. Sadly, none of the actions were ever actually very interesting and the theme adds nothing. If anything, it detracts from it since it makes so little sense.

This seemed like a late stage prototype in need of a card re-write and perhaps being built into a larger game.

Builds on you. First few games were a little dull but this game is great in that every game is totally different. At one stage you want Pineapples and Strawberries, the next you want coconuts or something else. At one stage you want to horde cards, the next get rid of them. You never know what will come out but you know it will change things. Its a fresh game every time but you have to get through a few games before it really hooks you and gets exciting.

cool worker placement game with a fair amount of strategy and an ever changing game situation as there are always new spots to play with
You place your pawn on a card, triggering a certain effect which you can use (e.g. draw cards, exchange cards, view the market etc.) The goal is to get certain cards (fruits) to convert them to juices. (You convert the action cards (so worker placement spots) itself)
The player to reach a certain number of juices first is the winner.
It's very cool that the "once converted" juices will not be played again so you have always other cards to show up which results in an ever changing game for you :)

Not just an interesting, original idea but actually a very good game. Starts as a very simple worker placement game but gradually evolves with more advanced and interesting actions as a non-destructive 'legacy' game. The game state can be 'saved' and continued at a later time and can be played with different groups at the same time. 

We played 8 games in a row the first time. 

Apparently ~20+ games to go through the whole deck of action cards, so around 7-10 hours for one complete game.

RATING: 8
Good amount of player interaction and strategy. Some of the cards are "meaner" than others, which is fun, and the cards that come out with the legacy twist force you to adapt your strategy and also keep the game interesting and new. I really like the anticipation of seeing the new cards come out. It's a pretty tight game as well score-wise, even with the legacy aspect, which keeps all players invested and competitive round to round. Love the card art and the wooden pieces as well. 8 for fun (and cuteness) with the right people. Player count best at 4 or 5.

Love the cards, artwork, humour and size. Game is great too. Quick and fun - a 'lets play another game' type of game.

If only I played at lunchtime - this would be a perfect lunchtime game.

A filler "resettable" legacy set collection card game. Play sets of fruit cards to pick an animal on display to use for their special ability or to add to your meld as a bottle of juice.  Continually drawing down from the large stack of animal cards to refill the display leads to successfively more powerful and interesting card interactions.  Games are fast, and it is easy to create a save point to pick up where you left off.  With this and 504 I really dig where Mr. Friese is heading to create a game with a different and variable starting state.  I feel he is on the verge of a game design breakthrough.

Half the commenters insist that [i]Fabled Fruit[/i] is too simple - and presumably jumped ship after 1-2 games - and the other half argue that players are rewarded with depth and a dirty massage once the game hits location 15.

Hence the Catch-22, since publishers want the game to be easy to learn, but not so vanilla that hardcore types are immediately driven away.  That's a difficult balance to strike, and future designers might note that overly basic starter scenarios have sunk more than a few games. One way to handle the problem would be to create introductory and advanced set-ups for light and serious gamers, respectively.

My two cents: I've now played a bunch, and the game's a big hit with family and friends.  The best of the Fabled series, to be sure.

And for those who turn up their noses at the juicing theme... don't get your berries in a twist when a danish will do.

This is such a simple game , that's very enjoyable,  when you play it makes you want to play again to see what the next set of cards will do. I don't know how many times you'd play it before the appeal of it drops, but it's a great idea.

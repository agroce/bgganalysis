[thing=63888]Innovation[/thing]: 2-4 players.

Easy rules, lots of interaction between players. Has an innovative splaying mechanics, and due to unique cards no two games are alike and anyone can win and ascend from 0 points to victory. Some prefer to play this with 2 players, but I like the extra chaos that comes with the third player. One of my favorite games to lose.

131026 wow.  amazing 2p game.

130929 I have purchased this game due to my fellow GCL meatball friends gushing over this game.  We'll see what i think of it after it arrives.  I definitely recommend playing this 2P only.

111023 A little chaotic and doesn't live up to the hype for me.  The dull graphic design severely detracts from the game for me.  I'll try it again certainly....

RATING: 8.8
Excellent game. Thoroughly enjoy the theme, mechanics, and the evolving strategy of each gameplay. It forces you think think tactically and adapt intelligently on the fly. Playing with 3 players seems the most balanced. Two player games can feel a bit stacked sometimes -- the winner being determined early on -- and four players generally pushes the game into the "age 10" cards, which IMO sway the game more than necessary. However, this game is always fun to pick up, because the mix of cards ensures that each game plays differently than any game before it.

RATING: 8
This game is fantastic.

Of the four of us:
  Chloe loves it, the thinky, deep, organized chaos.  Lots of choices all the time that are meaningful and potentially game swinging.
  Maximus really likes the take-that nature of it.
  Molly thinks it's way too much going on and is immediately turned off by the chaos of play.
  Aaron thinks the game has an incredible balance and thinks the dogma of each card represents it well, the theme shines through and doesn't feel pasted on.

All in all, excellent fun for the thinky conflict oriented gamer.

Not a bad play, but not a great one either. I suspect that with some more table time (played three times at this point) it might improve some. I'm giving it the shadow of the doubt, as I usually do with games I don't get excited about immediately.

After getting Glory to Rome and realising I missed out on a great game for years because the graphics weren't that great, I decided not to let the same thing happen twice and picked up Innovation (asmadi version)

Innovation is a great game.  I can see why some people would not like it, but I think its amazing.

I'm 13 plays in at this point and I could easily see playing this game past 50 plays.  I see there are some people playing this past 100 plays and i'd believe it.

The game is chaotic fun, But i'll try explain what it is I love about it. 
There are 100 odd cards each with a unique ability.  The first game or 2 you'll feel overwhelmed and perhaps not in control of whats going on. but the more you play you get to know the cards.  You know that in each age there are 10 cards, 2 of the 5 colors.  So while it seems random you have a strong element of knowing what is possible, and the odds of getting a specific card, color or element, in any given age.

It's got simple rules, but it's an extremely deep game.

This plays best with 2, and good with 3. which works well with Glory to Rome being good with 2 and best with 3-5.

RATING: 10
The base set of Innovation is a great game.  With over 100 unique cards spread over 10 ages, you never have the same game twice.  You're always looking at what your opponent has, how they can effect you (and how you can thwart that), and how you can effect them.  It's a game with a high degree of interactivity between the players.

It is a game of synergies, like its cousin Glory to Rome.  Making the cards in your hand work together to score you points, tech you up, and increase your icon dominance via splays (all the while defending and attacking with card effects and icon superiority) provides an engaging experience, but not an overly complex one.  While there can be some chaos with more than 3 players, it's not often that you feel like your plans all just went out the window, though that can definitely happen; isn't that what screwage is all about?.

It's one of my very favorite games.  Lighter, more interactive, and shorter than Glory to Rome, Innovation has a lot to recommend it to the table.

2013-05-10 (rating 8):

Somehow the game keeps dragging me in.

2011-09-23 (rating 6):

Far to random for me. No control over which cards are you getting. This is even worse when effect forces you to draw and mold a card - you don't know what will you draw and that could break a combo for example. Effects released by others also suffer from this as they cannot be target explicitly. Forcing your opponent to mold may make his position either better or worse. You don't know.

When playing with more players those drawbacks are even stronger.

To sum up an OK game that has nothing to offer for me.

RATING: 7.5
This is a quite complex game with simple rules. Everything is on the cards and every card is unique. The interplay with opponents makes the game shine - so it is best (for me) with 4 players. The flaws are around the swingy nature of the game - at times, one or two players can run away with the game, leaving others far behind. Some cards can be exceedingly unbalanced. But the game delivers a sweeping civ feel that is near absolute chaos and yet worth exploring. I like it alot!

RATING: 7
An excellent card game with lots of tactical decisions to make.  It does have a hectic pace that can put off some people, and because the board changes very quickly it may cause analysis paralysis in some players, but all in all it's a very good game.  As with any card game, there is some luck of the draw, but like any good card game, a skilled player can overcome a bad draw.  With more players, the game can become very swingy, so I'd recommend playing with fewer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Perhaps I am tainted by my first experience but I just didn't get any cards that could score my cards. As such, I was left doing very little for much of the game. Didn't feel like there were enough cards in each age for 3 player, game seemed to advance very quickly.

This is another one that I've read the more you play, the better it gets. I've only played it a few times, maybe 5, so I'm still kind of just going through the motions with no real large scale strategy in mind. If this is all there really is too it I should be ranking it lower than a 7, I'm giving it that score with the assumption that it has unrealized potential.

RATING: 6
I love this game two player. It doesn't scale well though IMO. At 4 players it begins to feel like the game resents you being involved. It runs like a petulant algorithm where you literally sit around while countless interdependent cards trigger actions amongst themselves as players take their turns until it is your turn again. It becomes impossible to plan ahead since everything is likely to change in front of you and everyone else by the time it gets around to your turn. My last 4 player game, I simply surrendered to the games will, waited until it was my turn, took some random action, and waited. I won. Still couldn't say why.

This is another game that I enjoy but am not very good at.  I can tell there's strategy here, but it eludes me.  Maybe I need to play it enough to have broad knowledge of the cards.

Update:  I've gotten better at the game, and I understand it enough to be able to prepare for certain attack vectors better.  It is improved by the expansion enough that I don't see playing without it.

+ Interesting take on civ building; Fun combos crop up to take advantage of.
- Game play is a bit too chaotic for my tastes.


Why it's previously-owned:
There just seemed to be way too much random chaos in this game.  I've heard that the chaos is reduced with repeat plays, but no one was interesting in working hard to like the game when we already have plenty other great ones.
I traded this away for Summoner Wars.

I'm not keen on games with lots of cards, each holding very specific text.  It makes it almost impossible to quickly assess the gamestate  - i.e. what everyone else is meant to be doing.  It's got some really interesting aspects to it though.

Terrific fun. Lots going on, tons of decisions. A good bit of luck involved but many opportunities for clever tactical play. The theme shows up if you pay attention to the cards and what's happening in the game. Playing it a lot of Isotropic (not recorded in my plays here), and it gets better and better. No two games feel alike. Filled with tension and excitement. Lots of chances to claw your way back with clever play, and victory is never in the bag if you've left yourself with a weakness. Wonderful things happen all the time. Aug 2013: 8 months later and still as good as ever.

RATING: 2
The game mechanic is cute, but the theme is shallow. The way the game play is too chaotic, you can forget strategy beyond one turn. Take an action that benefits you as much as possible, and you opponents as little as possible. Or alternatively, screws you the least and your opponents the most. Hope that someone wins quickly so you can play something more interesting. Definitely does not deserve top 200. Top 1,000 would be generous. Don't waste your time or money on this. Glory to Rome is infinitely better.

Good players get Maths and control the game.

But Innovation has almost no control at all. I suppose there might be some games where one could win with skill, but generally you're at the mercy of the draw gods. It's essentially a fiddly Fluxx with a poorly pasted on civ theme.

Definitely a winner in my book. Will generally play this whenever anyone wants to. It can be a bit sloggish when multiple new players are involved, but when people know how to play it goes pretty quick. It can be very swingy (AP or hyper analytical players could easily both drag the game down and get upset at the swings in luck) especially in the later ages, but makes for a fun experience.

------
After remembering that multiple people on BGG mentioned this game along with Race for the Galaxy and 7 Wonders, I took a chance with out doing full research.

The 1st game took about 2 hours with 4 people.  However the game seems *way* too random due to over-powerful cards as you progress through the ages. I actually wonder if there is any real strategy with 4 people. In other words, I wonder what percentage of the time will a very good and experienced player win over a new player?  So far it looks like a coin toss.

Wow! there is so much to try to hold onto in this game.  I can see near infinite replayability but it will take time to absorb the cards.  Understanding the outcomes of each in the various circumstances is an effort in itself.

Confusing to learn, primarily because the game is unique in so many ways.  Also, there are a lot of cards and each card is different, so there is a learning curve involved even after you begin to grasp gameplay/mechanics.  With all that said, I am looking forward to playing this more, as the game is pretty open in terms of paths to victory, and it seems like there's a lot of replayability here, especially once you learn how different cards work in combination.

Either among the greatest games I own, or the worst, I cannot tell, though I am leaning towards the former. The game is just so interesting and chaotic, and I do on some level feel like my people's culture is defined by the tech they have pioneered. The issue is that the game can move too fast for my strategies to keep up, especially with four people. I am choosing to believe this is not a flaw and rather that my head doesn't work fast enough for the game.

Played at Lodzki Port Gier in Poland. It's a simple game with a lot of possible strategies. Knowing the cards is an advantage and it's really difficult for a first timer to defeat an experienced player. The cards are far from balanced and there is little to no catching up mechanic in the game. A good thing is that the game is short. Would play at least one more time.

Bloody confusing.. I did not really enjoy my play as this game is very AP prone while players crane to look at all the other cards of all the other players... and then do that again as they forgot the first things they looked at and then.. oh wait it's my turn..

I suspect i should give it a second play though. as I do like Glory to Rome, and I suspect there's some fun to be had here somewhere..

I did only one game. Looked at first difficult to control, but with hindsight, I understand better the use of some cards, and the way they interact.
I think it can be a pretty deep and challenging game.

Edit : I played a four player game, and hated it. It lasted 3 hours, because somebody played fission just before the end of the game !!! No fun, no control, pure luck, might as well play Pay Day !

The more I play this game, the more I love it.  It plays pretty quickly with two, and I think it works best a 2player dueling card game anyway.  This helps keep the chaos in check and keeps analysis paralysis in check.  New Iello version is hot!  Traded in my old one for it.

Lowered my rating from 7.8 to a 4.0 to the current 2.0  The game devolves into a contest of whose "I win" card (of which there plenty to go around) cannot be negated by the other players.

The game is a luck fest, and even though I initially liked the mechanics and game play, even those have become tedius.  Advanced Fluxx.

Either you learn and memorize all the card effects, and then play intelligently.  Or, as a first timer, you just try to steer your way through all the chaos, and find a way to quietly build what you can.  This game is too chaotic for my tastes, but I do admire its creative mechanics.

Innovation for the win. I am always surprised by people reactions to this masterpiece. It's too chaotic! It's not thematic! It's ugly! There's no strategy! I guess that living in a society with the attention span of a microbe doesn't help. Reality is this game wants you to innovate. Getting stuck with the same combo for 2 turns its a recipe for disaster. You have to constantly change ad adapt your strategy, embrace chaos and dig into those decks! You may come up with the right solution for your problems...a real Innovation! Can't give this one enough praise. Avoid with 4p, 3p only with people that know the game and like it!

RATING: 7
Another fantastic game from Carl Chudyk which hits me on all cylinders.  It's fast, chaotic, tactical, strategic (although you'll need to have some knowledge of the cards for that) and most importantly a lot of fun.  Features a lot of player interaction and tons of cards which work to perform various combinations.  As a Magic player I really appreciate the aspect of finding card synergy in this along with the overall variance in card abilities.  The components could be a bit better as the artwork and graphics are very plain, with the only positive being that the backside art is well laid out and appropriate (each age has its own font and style).  Innovation is definitely a more chaotic experience than Glory to Rome, but is much easier to explain and play from the get go with games usually clocking in under 45 minutes.  I prefer playing this with three players both to minimize downtime and for an overall 'easier play feeling' as two player games are too confrontational and require too much thinking for me.

Tried playing the first edition once and had no idea what was going even after going through the rules. Still couldn't make sense of it after watching 2 other games played either.

Juego de duración intermedia que puede usarse para completar sesiones (1h - 1,5h). Muy entretenido pese a lo caótico y a la poca planificación que se puede hacer a largo plazo. Pese a ser algo abstracto como juego de civilizaciones, da cierta sensación de avance, desarrollo y competición. Partidas muy cambiantes con giros imprevisibles. Me parece MUY entretenido y me gusta bastante pese al azar, porque te hace exprimirte a tope en la búsqueda de combos para fastidiar al vecino. Creo que con su duración ajustada tampoco da tiempo a frustrarse si la suerte con las cartas te es esquiva.

An interesting tactical game of combining special powers to build an efficient engine.  Appears to be rather chaotic and luck-driven, but I suspect that repeated play will minimize this.  Much like Race for the Galaxy can seem dominated by who draws the best hand, when in actual fact you can often do great things with a bad hand and a little luck.

My chief worry is with regard to the amount of direct player interaction (of the 'I steal your score cards' variety).  Not so much a problem in a two-player game, but it makes 3 and 4 player games a little wild.  Still, it's a short enough game to handle a little chaos.

No longer interested in playing it with more than 2P. It's a trackfest even with that number. Lots of insane power pulls, which I think can be fine. What's ultimately not fine to me is feeling like I could play the game 20 times in a row and still not have a feeling for the deck and upcoming-card strategy. I guess you could just start with the first few and go from there, but artistically, you have raw iconography to go on too. And I don't know how you'd design it to be highly other-side-of-the-table usable. So, mostly unique card volume / interaction and UX issues making it a random and tactical game. With downtime issues and blah. Still strangely interesting, though. Now would rather play 2P Mottainai.

This game continues to grow on me. Two player seems to be best, followed by 3. Four is not fun at all for me, but that may be because the game becomes incredibly chaotic. The cards have variable power, but their effectiveness is often dictated by the situation. The epic card this game could be the useless card next game. Long term strategy isn't very effective with the changes in the game. Still, a better player is more likely to win. Also important is that an aggressive player is more likely to win. This is definitely not multiplayer solitaire.

It's hard for me to put into words how much I enjoy this game.  My wife is getting into it also now that we have the rules down.

I can't really disagree with people who describe this game as "controlled chaos" but there are no other short card games that get me as excited as this does.  

I love the frantic feeling of getting a point-scoring combo set up and then trying to use it before your opponent completely smashes it.  Smashing your opponents' combos is a lot of fun too!

All of the Carl Chudyk games I've checked out are good, but Innovation just might be his best, a confrontational card-based civilization builder with a lot of those multi-purpose and multi-directional card mechanics his designs are known for. I am fortunate to have started in on the Iello edition of the game, which is an enormous graphic improvement over the original. Gameplay is wild, with a fair amount of decisions largely because of how you can use the cards, but it's not so crazy that it lacks an intuitive feel after a few rounds.

The concept behind this game sounds fantastic, and it's really what draws me to it. Unfortunately, it sounds a lot better than it plays, and after a few plays I'm feeling lukewarm towards it. I think this is mostly because I find the cards to be very unbalanced: some are close to useless even in the best of circumstances, others can be either super helpful to you or incredibly devastating to your opponents, and I feel that the game doesn't provide enough balancing mechanisms for players to be able to compensate for this. Despite this, it's a simple game that plays fast, and as I mentioned the concept is great, so it should see occasional play.

I was a little disappointed with this game actually. I liked the idea of using cards in different ways, but I thought it was a little fiddly, with too much text and different abilities.

Looking at my metrics I realized i haven't rated Carl's second masterpiece.

I will admit I hated this game the first time I played it. even being an early fanboy of GtR.  But... we played with four.  Don't do that.  or use teams if you must, but really, just don't.  Play it with three.  or two.  and then play it again.  It becomes a game (instead of an experience) once you know the cards.  Before that, it's a thrill ride type of game, and as a thrill ride game, it's just middle-of-the road.

But once you know what to expect from the piles, and once you know what certain cards will do to the game... then it's back in your control (within reason).

Brilliant.  Shouldn't be a long game.

The best civilization game for me. It's got Chudyk's overloaded cards - they symbolize the technological level of your civilization, active advancements, score, achievements, and your ability to resist and prevent the sharing of card effects. Not to mention the number of ways those card effects interact with other cards!

I think any player count works well, here - as long as you do teams for 4 players. People say the game is chaotic, and they're right - but playing tactically amid the chaos is great. And better strategies that make the most out of what's available beat inferior ones.

I just don't like crapshoot cards like Alchemy and Physics - they mar the game space in my opinion. Cards that give you at least some benefit, like Metalworking, aren't as bad.

Finding this extremely hard to rate, since the game is very swingy, and you can have quite a bad experience with the game if the luck of the draw just doesn't go your way. There are ways to mitigate this, but they themselves depend on card draws, and are non-obvious for inexperienced players. Despite that, I'm somewhat in awe of the innovation displayed in this design, as well as the progression through the ages, each with their own flavour and mechanics. 

So this rating is very much a "how much do I personally feel like playing it, compared to various other games"-rating. The game itself is a flawed but interesting breath of fresh air. You need to be able to shrug off bad experiences, and don't ever play it with 4, and then you might just enjoy it more than you'd expect.

There are a few excellent ideas in this game.  But on first play there appeared to be a big 'take that' element, which could easily leave a player out of the running.  Two games were won with the one player getting cards 1 to 4.  Maybe there should be a deduction of points each tome a VP card is purchased.  I am sure given the designer's track record that this game plays well with experienced players.  (GFR is a favourite of mine - but only with a couple of rules tweaks.)  Unfortunately I think the issues with the game will mean most players won't get that far.  I think there is probably an excellent game waiting to be created here from the games innovations, but for me this is not quite it.

After the first few plays (with just 2 players: with more everything should be crazier...), this game is a tough beast to master: sometimes one can feel incredible depth, some other times it's frustrating when a huge swing of fortune mess up with your plans. This is definitely not a game for control freaks... Initial rating is 7.

Update june 14, 2012: After almost 20 plays, I am becoming addicted to the game! Innovation in my head is now part of a "holy trimurti" of great card games: Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome and, of course, Innovation.
When you begin to learn the cards, you can try to master the crazy wild horse and contain the huge swings.
Obviously the game is more strategic when played with just 2, while with 4 it can end abruptly with little to no control, but Innovation has in its DNA all the elements of a great game: constant tension (between USING cards and PLAYING cards), difficult decisions, easy rules, increasingly powerful unique card effects than lead to end-game climax... A wonderful, ingenious game by mr. Chudyk! Rating increased to 7.5.

Update april 25, 2015: while I can't stand a four player game, the three player is definitely good, and the two player is a wonderful, agonizing knife-fight in a roller coaster! Rating upgraded to 8 (and it would be a 9 if it was a 2-player only affair...).

RATING: 5
Good use of cards (splaying), a lot of different actions and possibilities, but I'm not convinced yet. I must see first if there isn't a runaway problem for the leader. But certainly a second play is necessary to give a right score.
Second play stated the feeling of the first play and so I lowered my score. A lot of reading and because of thz randomness, it's difficult to have a strategy because your hand can change 3 times in one turn.

I must say I played it once with 3 players and once with 4. Maybe it's better for two.

Another great Chudyk design.  In some ways I like how different many elements are from the Glory to Rome series.  One negative I have discovered is that an experienced player can really beat you up a bit and dominate.  Given the higher level of interactivity than GtR/Mottainai this is a factor in reducing who I can enjoy playing this with.  The combos can verge on the too crazy but with base game only at least do not cross the line.  Really enjoyable game with a good amount going on.  I do think some of the mechanics here could be reused in other games as both the splay and the share with leader/ need to lead to demand currency mechanic works really well.  Need more games but whilst this is unlikely to overtake Mottainai it is certainly a game I am very much wanting to explore more.

:d10-2:
Early experience with Innovation is dominated by individual cards. Since you don't yet know the full of range of possible actions, strong cards with non-obvious counters often go the distance. The game is now luck-based.

With more experience, you learn the counters to individual cards. How do you take out The Wheel and Metalworking? Engineering or Gunpowder. How do you take out Mathematics? Machinery or Societies. How do you take out Skyscrapers? Fission or just ending the game. Each card can be neutralized by one or more other cards, and thus the game becomes a scramble for the first "broken" card, and subsequently its counter or a "more broken" card. The game is now tactics-based.

With even more experience, you develop an awareness of game state patterns. You arrive at a certain game state and realize that you've seen it or something similar in a previous game, and you know its various branches. Your focus shifts to control of the game state, and you attempt to manipulate it to a position that will end in your victory. Good play sometimes entails passing up on achievements to establish board position, while other times it entails giving up board position to claim achievements. Either way, these actions are taken with a specific end in mind. It all depends upon the game state and how far ahead you can see. The game is now strategy-based.

In this way, it's a bit like jazz improvisation. Beginners play random notes that fit over the chord structure, with no sense of melodic logic except what feels right. Intermediate improvisers (such as myself) develop melodic patterns, or 'licks', that sound good at particular parts of the chord structure. They don't have a sense of the overall shape and scope of the improvisation, so they string together many of these melodic fragments into a pleasant-sounding, but ultimately meaningless, musical statement. Advanced improvisers have reached the point at which they cease to think about improvisation in terms of melodic patterns, and instead see it as a temporal canvas, where the architecture of the music is constructed at a macro level and descends from there.

I like the mechanic. Not sure if there is enough balance. The 1st game we played one player jumped out into the lead and it was soon over. Also, the wife & I don't really tend to play games with the "take that" mechanic. Some of the dogmas have an unbalancing effect, some did not. Just "okay" in my book. I tired it again, and still don't get it.

{2P: 10, 3P: 9, 4P: ???}

My first game of [i]Innovation[/i] was an epic, 2p battle.  You can read the session report here: [thread=553768][/thread].  After that exhilarating experience, I had to get my own copy.  And as you might have surmised, I knew that I already loved this game.

[i]Innovation[/i] does exactly that.  The iconic "ring of cards" with the achievements in the middle challenges you from the get-go.  The seemingly-oversized reference cards soon develop their own personality, as you fan cards that have been scored to the left, and your achievements to the right.

Dominance in a "dogma" is determined by how many symbols appear on your played cards.  In a novel idea, cards start out in a stack, then get splayed to the left where a single symbol on each lower card is revealed, thus increasing your power.  In the middle game, cards can be splayed to the right instead, revealing two symbols on each lower card.  Finally, cards get splayed [i]up[/i], revealing three symbols on each lower card.  It's a very clever mechanism that imparts the idea of progress.

[person=6001]Carl Chudyk[/person] is also the developer of [i][thing=19857]Glory to Rome[/thing][/i], and there is a similar chaotic feeling to [i]Innovation.[/i]  I love civ builders, and was very surprised at how well a seemingly simple batch of cards embodies that genre.

My feelings about this game are kind of mixed. I had a great first game. It was a two player game against my brother. I got some lucky first draws in the beginning, giving me what turned out to be a significant leap ahead. I also later had some very lucky timing moments for some very powerful dogma abilities. Needless to say, my brother fell behind very quickly. Based on my experiences playing games with my brother, I am usually not nearly as brilliant with my strategies and planning ahead as he is, choosing instead to rely too much on chaos and the luck of the draw, often only thinking one move ahead. Sometimes it works well enough to be close, and sometimes it fails me miserably. In this first game, I was so far ahead by the end, I felt there should have been some sort of mercy killing component in the rules. I had abilities to take all his points and abilities to take all his cards. My machine had effectively shut down all chances for my brother to even do anything.

That said, as we talked about it later, it was apparent be both saw some great potential in the game. It truly is well designed and worth the score I am giving it. The dogma abilities range from really cool to downright ruthless. And, honestly, I was impressed even when the ruthless card was being used against me. I suspect that my score for this game will only get better. And even though my brother had to experience being that far behind and so out of control, he also expressed a desire to play the game a lot more.

More nice things about this game? The artwork and overall card design is very well done. It's a tiny package. It doesn't take up too much space on the table. It sets up quickly. And if you already know the rules, it seems it would also be quick. I highly recommend it. And if you do get it and you have a bad game now and then with a runaway leader, I suggest simply giving the victory to him, reshuffling the cards, and starting a new game.

Very clever usage of cards and each of it has its own unique powers. However, I find it difficult to teach players and most players have trouble interpreting the meaning of each cards to fully decide on a strategy. With the trouble in interpretation, this game can goes on for too long thanks to analysis paralysis. It's not a game I will keep in my collection but I'm willing to play with experienced gamers if the mood strikes.

I don't see how this is anything other than falling into game breaking combos. The entire game is like playing street fighter and only using the leg sweep.

Update: I'm not sure how I keep getting convinced to play this. Further games have lead me to believe this game is sub-par and in the same vein of games as Fluxx. The game is either over very quickly or drags on until the person in last place ends it to end their suffering. Memorizing cards/combos doesn't make this fun, some sort of tension or real theme might have made this better.

For the only time ever I comment on a game without playing it. I have read two summaries by two players who's opinions I rarely have issue with. Both say:

The game is utterly driven by the card draw.
Poor card draws will remove all possibility of winning.
Some cards are strong some weak.
A player can be cut off at the ankles and have no means to recover or retaliate.
Final scores can vary considerable with final winner decided in last moments on the draw of a card.
An utterly random chaotic experience never to be repeated.
Two copies of the game bought at significant expense from America up for sale the day after play.

Puritans will say I must experience the game to decide for myself. I have many excellent games that I don't play enough. Why bother with something that seems so utterly flawed and a chaos-fest when I hate randomness so much?

Enjoyed my first play quite a bit as all three of us were fighting to end the game the way we wanted.  There seem to be a lot of options to manage the chaos so to speak.  I'll need to play this a few more times before I really have a  feel for how much I like it, but I definitely want to play it more.

Second play I was able to win with only ever getting 6 cards and racing up my point pile to score the first 6 achievements.  My opponent was miles ahead of me in melded cards and was able to draw 10s while I was only able to draw 6s.  But, I got in that last achievement just before he destroyed me.

Interesting game and I'm fascinated about how much it can change during play.  I always wait for two plays to rate a game, but I feel like this one needs more plays before I can give it a true rating.  Feels like it certainly has the potential to go up.

Funny... I've actually lowered my rating from 7.5 to 7.  I do still like the game, but the chaos level is a bit high.  And, unfortunately, my wife is very sour on the game now because to her "it feels like Fluxx."  I understand the comparison though I see a lot more build up compared to the ultra-chaos in Fluxx.

RATING: 9.2
This game took me completely by surprise. It has a very abstract theme, but really innovative mechanics. I really like the way it represents a 'tech tree' with card pools that gradually become exhausted and lead to more powerful cards. The scoring system is pretty good too, with each card potentilly being a face-up resource, a tracker of current score, or a victory point card. Card effects are varied and exciting, and the complex ways you interact with the cards in front of them make your turns feel like a big puzzle to be solved (which I love). If this were easily available in Australia I'd buy it tomorrow.

I want to like this game, but right now I cannot. The first play with my wife she got out to an early lead and I was stuck with cards that I couldn't use. Part way through I got a low value card she couldn't defend and never got a defense for I exploited it over and over again for the win.

RATING: 4
Too chaotic.  Too easy to steal or trash your opponents' stuff.  You could go so far as to say it has a Fluxx-like feeling with 4 players.  Maybe it's better with less than 4 players, but it seemed to have a lot of powerful cards, a lot of weak cards, and very little in between.  Every card is unique so the learning curve is fairly steep.  Also, it's hard to catch up if you fall behind.

I would still like to try it again... with 2 or 3 players.

UPDATE 2013: Only worthwhile as a 2p game.  With 3-4p is just too chaotic because it's difficult to keep track of opponents' abilities and because you quickly burn through the draw decks for each era/age, at which point higher tech cards start to imbalance the game.  It's also luck-heavy in that you have to hope you draw cards with dogmas that allow you to score.

RATING: 7
I am far from having the kind of knowledge of the cards that would admit me to what I understand is the deep gameplay that many rave about here. I do see, though, that the cards cleverly balance a number of mechanics (the colors, resources, number in each pile, etc.) that make for a rich experience in a short time with an easy ruleset to master. The game consistently invites me to explore it, though, which I like. Because of the wildness, the game is much more tactical than strategic, but the tactical choices are usually interesting choices. For lovers of complex card games, this is probably a must-purchase because of the reasonable price. I don't know if it's a must play for me as it sometimes seems a little cold. Nevertheless, I'm glad I own it and could see it becoming a staple with a suitably minded player.

This game grows on me with every play, so much so I traded in my original version for the beautiful Iello version.

RATING: 7
A very interesting card game!

Deeper than I thought. It requires strategy and some luck (card drafting) and it's quite a tense game. 
There's a lot of interaction, since most of the cards have a Supremacy Dogma or Cooperative Dogma. Either way, most of the cards will affect you, the good or the bad way.

Some cards, I guess, are overpowered and can win you the game. Some of them... from early ages, but still, is a game where the strategy takes its place. The mechanics are quite interesting, mostly the "splay" action, that makes the game shine.

I wouldn't play with 4 players, as there is too many things to focus on. With 2 is fantastic, with 3 still ok.

The game feels like an engine-game and you'll find it immersive. The problem here is... when you're really in the game, enjoying the way you splay your cards, and use their different abilities, someone rushes the endgame and puff... it's over, and you're still in age 6 ou 7.

I think the game could last a little bit longer, not that the game is quick (60min +/-), but you feel that it ends sooner that it was supposed.

Overall, a very pleasant game! Oh is it about innovations? Hmmm I guess so, but it's almost themeless!

Too much to read. If you want to plan your turn well you need to check the gamestate completely, which means you need to read the abilities of the cards again etc.. If you don't you may be punished. -> Information overload. Apart from that it's great.

RATING: 9.3
One of my all time favorite games!  I love the multiple win conditions and how every game seems to play out differently.  Though Innovation can feel something like a wild ride, with experience, tactics can be developed to control the flow and push for desired outcomes.

Expansions add a lot of additional variety, but aren't necessary to have an enjoyable game.

I'm undecided if I prefer the two player game over the three player game, but both are good.  The four player game is pretty bad.  The four player team game though can be alright.

Inital rating, need to play it again.

Seemed rather chaotic with 4 - and I felt the downtime (which actually is a good thing, as the downtime wasn't that bad, it was more a case of wanting to take my turn NOW as I was enjoying the game ...)

Probably better with 3 or 2.

Rating after initial play.  Everything I had read about this game prior to playing made me predisposed to disliking it.  I am happy to report that the game is neither tough to grasp or very deep.  It is, in fact, mostly tactical.  Those players engaged in a deep long-term strategy seemed doomed to fail.

After second play, it is quite evident that you will have a game now and then where you will have absolutely no chance due to card draws.

A very cool civilization-building card game.  I've read a lot about the splaying mechanic, and I'm amazed that it works, really inventive.  My only concern is it seems like it would be prone to a bunch of back and forth gotcha's that will bring the game to a standstill.  Until I see that concern in action, this game is a solid 9.

10x10 2014. Love the total chaos of this game.  Throw away any strategy you thought you had because the state of the game changes constantly.

Great 2-player too which is a huge plus.

Lots of crazy card combos. Knowing what cards you can expect is the only way to make a long (ish) term strategy. This means it needs lots of plays. If you're behind on points, start trying to jump ages. Later ages get crazier. Also try and keep up with having as many symbols as your opponent to leech as much as possible

Innovation is an incredible card game, well worth getting for almost any gamer, especially given the price.  The rules tell you what you can do, and how to win, but the mechanisms by which you score points (and become eligible to claim achievements, which is the goal of the game) are all special card powers.  This means that you begin your first game with no idea how you're actually going to be able to score points - this can be a bit frustrating if you're trying to learn the game from the rules (as opposed to being taught the game by an experienced player).  However, after a few turns, it will become clear.

The game has 110 cards, and every one is unique.  This means that the first few games have an element of discovery.  It makes the game move more slowly, but it is fun to draw a card with the feeling that it might do practically anything.  With more plays, players begin to know what they might find in any given stack, and play becomes more strategic, although I suspect this will always be a mostly tactical game.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed my plays so far, and look forward to a lot more.  This is a keeper, and a true gem.  I have only played 2er, which is fantastic, but suspect this would work just fine with a larger group.  For my wife and I, it is a great fit.

Initial rating: 9

This is card based civilization game.  The first few plays will see players probably see whomever gets an early achievement lead taking the game.  This effect seems to dissipate after a few plays.

By play #4, my wife and I were always neck and neck on scoring achievements, with many being a 'if you hadn't gotten it just then, I was about to snag it'.  This was the case for the basic achievements as well as a tooth-and-nail fight for EMPIRE.

Scoring is critical.  If you cannot score you cannot achieve.

Splaying is important.  A  higher symbol count allows extra actions on other player's turns and prevent detrimental "I demand" effects.

Tucking is only really helpful if you've already splayed.

Drawing cards is helpful.  Teching ahead is more helpful but a built in 'catch up' mechanic means you won't keep a tech advantage for long if you don't maintain that pace.

In the end, this is a nice game that has a lot to explore.

Fun little card game, that starts off simple and grows more and more complex. There is a lot of information to keep track off including what symbols you have as well as your opponents, what kind of actions your opponents can take, how many points everyone has, what you need to achieve the special achievements, etc. 

Even with all that, it remains pretty strategically deep, and the gameplay is fun.

[b]Civilizations plus:[/b] One of the first contemporary games I bought, and still one of my favorites. I love the build-up from a stuttering two-technology prehistory through a digitized civilization (if you make it that far), and the quirky, yet somehow apt, interpretation of how technologies affect your tableau and abilities. I love that sometimes you have to break your civilization down in order to move it forward. And I love that it's highly interactive, sometimes crazily overpowered, and yet allows, maybe more than any other game I know, for exhilarating wins from behind. So much game in two decks' worth of cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My gaming group has really enjoyed this one. It's fast, exciting, strategic, and simple to play. It probably works best with 2 players, but we've found that the 3-player version works pretty well, too.

I must say that the theme definitely feels tacked on. Some cards reflect their subject matter brilliantly (e.g., Gunpowder allows you to blow up castles), but a lot of others will leave you scratching your head (why are Medicine and Vaccination attack cards?) That's a minor issue for me, though, since the gameplay is mostly good. 

My only issue with the gameplay is that things can get a little chaotic and random, especially toward the end of the game. Once the deck gets to the 9s and 10s, the game can end quite suddenly and unexpectedly, and it's often not the player who was dominating the whole game who emerges the victor. Sometimes this can be a positive feature, however, as even a player who had a miserable early game is never entirely hopeless, because they can try to get a 10 out and win that way. In 2-player games, however, the game will often end well before the late cards make an entrance.

The online version of this game (at innovation.isotropic.org) is completely free and works very well. It tends to play a lot faster than the in-person game, because the game will track score piles and icons for you.

I want to try it again but it is a rather chaotic game.  I don't think there is any strategy involved.  I think the game is purely tactical and even luck of the draw can squash some tactics.  I had a pair of splayed melds but got steamrolled by a player with a single strong card (and neither of us other 2 players could draw the needed symbol to stop him).

So that was frustrating but I do love civilization style games so I'd play again gladly.

I like that there are countless possible combinations of powers, symbols and dispositions for the cards. There exists the potential for a serious runaway leader in a two player game, but I think this would be less of an issue between experienced players who know the game. Great with 3 and 4.

Based on 2 plays and subject to change:

Our first two games of this were very entertaining. We began off not really knowing what the cards were like, so both stumbled through the game.

Overall a very enjoyable game. Seems to have lots of different options for victory, and I can see how the different card combinations can lead to very different outcomes.  In both games, although one player took an early lead, the other found a way to at least remain competitive.

Certainly want to play this one again, and am giving it an initial rating of 9. Very simple rules, lots of variety, no downtown, and lots of decision making. An impressively designed game.

My first play of Innovation was four player, and yes, as you'd expect, it was no fun.  Thank god I trusted my instincts and picked it up anyway.  This is a great 2 player game - in fact, playing with more adds to brain-burn almost exponentially.  That said, the game is primarily tactical, so you can't feel too bad about losing.  Like Glory to Rome, the mechanisms in this one take a while to wrap your head around - particularly how to proceed when you don't have a card that gets stuff into your score stack.  Many have compared this to a juiced-up Fluxx, but it's much more fun than that.  Yes, it is quite dependent on the card draw, but like any good drafting game, there are more or less smart ways to take cards.  Our excitement for this one has cooled recently (at least, mine has, since I win all the time), and I'm pretty ambivalent about the idea of expansions.  That said, this is one of the most unique card games out there, it plays great with 2, and we enjoy it more than Glory to Rome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I have mixed feelings. I think the design is unique and really conveys the feeling of a Civ game in a short, all-card format. However, some of the cards are WAY too powerful, and can reward players who keep using the same powers over and over again, turn after turn, before others get a chance to resist them. 

The game is also a little too cruel/unforgiving for my taste. I often find myself either 1) really annoyed at what other players are doing to me or 2) feeling bad about how mean I'm being to everyone else. Resentment and guilt are two emotions I can do without on a Friday night with friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I kept thinking "Fluxx" while playing this.  Add a few overpowered cards, a really random card selection where you can't choose to go in any particular direction, and a constant turn order problem concerning the VPs.. and you've got a clunker that may be able to be saved by revamping a few things.

Update:  I've played the finished game now and I've come around somewhat on it.  I don't think the game should be played with 4 at all, I think 3 is really the sweet spot for this, and I'm looking to try it with that amount.

2nd Update:  I played this with 2 and found it pretty enjoyable, though I'm starting to wonder if there's a runaway leader problem present.

3rd Update:  Yep, there's definitely a runaway leader problem in the game.  Also, this is not a 3 or 4 player game, you should only play it 2 player, and I think I'll try to only play it that way in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Highly random game.  You either draw cards that work together or you don't.  Sometimes you have a runaway leader, but other times his engine falls apart due to a random draw and other players get to catch up.  It's really irritating when you go through the entire game without drawing one of the colors, or don't get cards that enable scoring.  I like it, but it's not a strategy game.  The splaying mechanic is awesome!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
WAY too random for my taste. You FEEL like you're making meaningful decisions, but in the grand scheme of the game, I don't think a seasoned player has much of an advantage over a new player. That's fine for some occasions, but when I want something this random I think I'll stick to Fluxx.

RATING: 7
Picked this up at Myriad Games in Manchester, NH.  Had heard good things and wanted to have some light stuff on hand for my time in NH.

It's an excellent game, though not without flaws.  The mechanics of building and using your technology piles are simple to learn and very fun.  With most people it's quick, strategic and pleasant, though some players can get overwhelmed with the number of choices.

On the downside, the theme is essentially irrelevant.  Worse, in a two-player game it's fairly easy for one player to take the early lead and never look back.  And with more players it turns too chaotic for my taste (though I haven't tried the four-player team rules).

UPDATE:  This has the potential to be my favorite card game OF ALL TIME.  Seriously, it matches up with my game desires that well.  I think this smal box delivers a really terrific game experience.  I am obsessed with it, and would play it for days straight if I could.  The only reason I haven't rated it a "10" is because I have not had it long enough to see if this feeling lasts... but the outlook is very positive.  Very positive indeed.

I've been led to believe that the problems I have with this game are exacerbated at 3 and 4 players, and that Innovation may really be a 2-player only experience. I'll probably give the game one more chance with 2.
---
I've cooled on this since I first played it. Far too easy to get behind early due to bad luck, impossible to catch up once behind the power curve, the poor tend to get poorer, and the cards are woefully uneven and game balance is not good. Some clever ideas I think, but needed a lot more development.
---
The special powers are a little out-of-control here, and it's insanely chaotic, but I felt it was still pretty fun, in a "try to do the best you can given a constantly changing environment". Not to be played with anyone who suffers from analysis paralysis, as the analysis possibilities are insane. After one play I'm of somewhat mixed minds. Juggling the special powers is fun, but it may just be a bit too long, too involved, and too abstract for the chaos. Doesn't have the same charm as Glory to Rome, although that game wasn't without its flaws either. But still, I would enjoy playing again.

RATING: 8
Wow!  I was totally surprised at how much I liked this one!  I was a little worried about others' comments about how random the game was, but I thought it still managed to be very fun despite randomness of the draw.

The real fun here is figuring out how to make the best of the cards you get.  Sometimes you'll play a card because you want to use its dogma effect.  Sometimes you'll play it simply for its symbols to avoid being the victim of a "take that" card or to piggy-back on someone else's potential dogma effects.  Sometimes you'll play it in order to later score it.  Really, there are so many possibilities, which makes the ame a blast to play!

One word of warning... you're probably going to run into cards that seem way overpowered in your first game or two.  However, a card that is crazy awesome in one game has the potential to be nearly useless in the next.  For instance, gunpowder is awesome if players leave a bunch of castles on their stacks.  In our first game, this card pretty much single-handedly won the player that drew it the game, as the other two players were very castle heavy.  However, once players become familiar with the cards, they know this card is likely coming and try to plan accordingly.  As a consequence, gunpowder did not end up being game-breaking in the following game.  So, whether a card is balanced or not really depends on the players' familiarity with the cards and whether they're planning accordingly.  This may be a problem if you frequently teach the game to new players, or are not the type of group to play a single game frequently.

I also love tactical games just as much as strategic ones, and I would say that overall this game is highly tactical.  Yes, you need some strategic planning to plan for the appearance of certain cards in the game, but overall it's about capitalizing on the cards that you get, and cashing in on small windows of opportunity when they arise.

Overall, I had a great time exploring the cards and quickly jaunting through the inventions throughout history!  It's a very interesting and fun game, and I look forward to exploring it more!

RATING: 6

[thing=63888][/thing] was my second purchase of the month, and I'm not sure what to think about it just yet (here’s a hint: I’m not optimistic).  Innovation is a medium-length card game from [person=6001]Carl Chudyk[/person], the designer of [thing=19857]Glory to Rome[/thing].  The comments about the designer employing outrageous swings of fortunate to balance each other are certainly accurate.  Unfortunately, each of the 100+ cards have unique (and often outrageous) effects, so putting the how, when, and why to initiate that balancing act in the hands of the players creates a costly entry barrier to the game.  Those who like the game tout its status as one that will take a lot of practice to master (and thus implying that it is a game with lots of replayability).  My worry is that it will similarly take a lot of practice to ever get proficient enough to make games strategic, tense, or interesting.

To give you just a sense of the complexity of the game, consider that each of Innovation's cards comes in one of five colors and contains three symbols, from any of six possible symbol types, located in three of four possible locations.  The way in which these symbols accumulate when played - which depends on how stacks of cards in each color are splayed (either stacked, splayed left, splayed right, or splayed up) - determines your civilization's strength in a number of areas.  Strength is important because each card contains a text-based power (or two) that may have repercussions for players with more or fewer symbols of the type displayed next to the power.  Confused yet?  I kinda was.  

My hope is that a little experience rounds the game into something similar to [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing]: a game in which every player can make reasonably good tactical choices every turn and potentially be in contention against players with roughly similar experience.  My hope is also that the game contains room to truly accommodate cutthroat strategic gaming with additional experience.  But it's really too early to know any of that.  At the moment, it feels a little closer to [thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing] [thing=258]Fluxx[/thing], where randomly drawn one-off card effects combine with a dense symbol-driven arms race to produce something both hard to control and hard to follow.  

The first play was little more than blindly stumbling through a morass of symbols that seemed quite overwhelming.  It also resulted in a runaway leader (me, to dispel any doubt that the leader was not also blindly stumbling), which is something that worries me at the introductory level.  The second play was closer, but only because my opponent put together a two-card combo halfway through the game that took all of my scoring cards and was based on symbols in which I was extremely deficient.  From there it was just a matter of turning the crank for enough rounds. 

Add to the complexity and the chaos an absence of blindingly obvious thematic elements and it seems that Innovation also has a lot of room to be a colossal flop for me.  My wife has already decided that she likes [thing=38797][/thing] better.  Considering I'm actively open to trading Uruk, that doesn't bode well.  Here’s hoping things turn around.

There's something about this which works very nicely. At first it seems there's not much to it - but then people start to see the combos and opportunities and threats and the game seems to become richer and more interesting.

I imported the Asmadi version because I liked the simplicity of the cards and the clean design certainly helps during play.

I'm not sure a 7 rating does this justice. When my group needs a clever 4-player game which takes 45 minutes to an hour I can see this being pulled out of the bag on a regular basis.

Fabulously designed game with fast ease of play although sometimes a little down time as you count all the symbols to see what your best option is and sometimes a little luck for your opponent on a card draw can leave you a little stuck and then it is hard to turn the game around.

This is a hard game to play properly. At first it felt like a wild advanced Fluxx ride, but after losing over and over again to better players, I realized that this is not Fluxx. 

You have a lot to pay attention to, icons, card effects, draw piles, scores, and you want to be ahead in both score and all icon counts, but that's unlikely to happen.

The tension in this game seems to come down to who's the player who's winning and who's the player who's losing. I know, that sounds like all games, but due to how players interact in this game, the winning player is often hammering one card over and over again in order to win, while a losing player is looking for a way to either neutralize that card (by icons, by stealing it, by covering it up) or finding a card that hammers better.

This one is different... I think the idea of using the cards in different ways is kinda neat. Something I am not familiar with really from other games. Moving through the different eras of technologies is really fun. 

One of the things that's kind of hard to swallow in this is how swingy it can be. It's easy to come out of nowhere and win a game from behind by sheer luck.

RATING: 8
Despite being a fan of tableau-building games, I resisted purchasing Innovation for a long time because the ideas and technologies in the game are incorporated in such a highly-abstracted form - moving cards around based on who has the most of a particular icon really did not seem that appealing.  One day, I tacked it onto a board game order and I am glad I did.  The actual mechanics of the game are very simple, but the interactions between the different dogmas give the game its depth.  The way splaying is used to convey progress is simple and elegant.  Furthermore, despite the abstraction, the dogmas do make sense thematically.  For example, "Gunpowder" destroys cards with Castle icons, allowing the attacker to score these.  This game is for those who enjoy exploring the interactions and combinations of card effects, and being a skilled player requires knowledge of the dogmas, which will only develop with repeated plays.  It is a very tactical game and can be somewhat chaotic at times.

Like Cosmic in that most powers are diverse in their overpowered nature, sometimes hilariously so. But also fair to say if things go horribly hideously wrong, it is often your fault. One of the more unique, if chaotic, card tableau games out there and nothing if not fun, if a little dry for non gamers.

This has been my favourite game since the first time I played it. I frequently beg for another game as soon as I've finished one, and when no-one else will play with me, I've been known to play against myself. (Sad, I know!)

I LOVE the tactical thinking, and having to be on guard simultaneously against so many possibilities.

Don't be put off by all the text on the cards and the fact it usually plays quite a bit slower on your first run-through. This is a great game, both challenging and fun.

I've now played Innovation a bunch of times before rating it. I just don't love games where efficient card combos are what drive the game. This plays fast, the theme is surprisingly well integrated and fun, and I love the ridiculous swings of fortune every game seems to produce. 

The splaying, the symbols - just too much iconography and wonky rules for me to want to play with non-gamers. And I don't have a 2-player heavier gaming partner. Doesn't fit anywhere for me.

Perhaps I would rate this higher if I had played it more than 5 times. I think that you need to know at least some of the cards in order to make the game shine - but I don't like the game enough to want to spend the time exploring this game in depth. And 5 games is actually a lot for me, especially for a game I don't care for.

I don't like that you can win if you draw the right card at the right time, but I guess it's good that everybody has a chance to win. However, I would feel a little screwed if I had most achievements, played better etc., and then another player draws a card which changes everything and then s/he suddenly wins. I guess some people find that's a strength of this game, but I don't. I really enjoy Glory to Rome, but this game by the same designer has fallen flat for me.

This is a tough one to rate.  Kudos to this game for the immense variety of card actions that make for an immense variety of combos.

But ... I do not like games where you constantly have to look around and count up a bunch of ever-shifting symbols or numbers.  It feels to me like I am spending most of the game doing just that.  Moreover, the theme is pasted on in the extreme.  It's a game of action cards wherein you can play action cards to your advantage by comparing your symbols with those of others, and it features a heavy take-that element.  Toooo dry and doesn't scale well.  Plus, it helps to know what others' action cards say, but it's too hard to read their card text.

  This one is a winner for me.  I like that there is a great deal of interaction, but that random factor may make other enjoy it less.  The splaying mechanic is interesting as well.  While it may take a few plays to understand some of the possible interactions among the cards, this game while a 9 for me could be seen as much lower if you need a more perfect information game.  With 2 players very tense and easy to keep with a plan.  Four player may start feeling like they are entering a game closer to Fluxx (Although I personally hate that comparison).  There is still strategy, but you just can't trust that your perfect plan will stay intact (Just like in the real world).  All said a great game probably best with 2 or 3, I'd still play with 4 (7.5 for 4 player)

The graphics of the European Iello edition is great. The rules are great. The idea is certainly great. And then it stops...I was overwelmed by all the possibilities all the different cards offer and I'm not sure if the gaining of domains (Culture, Military, Science...) is possible in the beginning of the game. I did not have the feeling that the game was balanced. Some cards are just too powerful. How come I can keep robbing players  in the Modern age from influence with my Middle Age 'Medecine' card???? 
Something not correct in this game...I wonder if the designer did not lose his way in all the possibilities offered by the different cards????      
This is my first rating after a first play and will surely play again...just because it looks worth it and...it still IS a great idea!

RATING: 6.5
This is a very fun game, and the differing card actions and combos, tied with the unique icon system, make for a very fun an innovative way to interact with other players.

There are two nits though I have with this game:

(1) Sometimes you don't really know what someone else did to you because it's hard to read their cards in advance

(2) In the end game, there are cards that are insta-win if certain conditions are met. Some of these I think are too easy and may undermine careful strategy up to that point (making this game seem more flux like).

I like this game and will continue to be played while I get enough experience to form a better opinion of it.

I enjoyed the three player game much more than the two player game and I fear that a four player game might be too much.  I'm not sure how much depth there is going to be after repeated plays, but so far so good.  It can be infuriating at times, and the card draw luck can really get if you if  you can't score points, but it seems like there are enough cards that help you mitigate the bad card draws.

Received as a generous gift from my good friends. I sleeved this game with MtG size sleeves (63 x 88 mm).

Initial rating an "8." I hear people refer to RftG, Dominion, etc. as "super fillers," and I didn't really have a game of that sort. Innovation is my addition for that niche, with some deep, fairly complex card interactions but relatively quick playing time.

What separates it from Dominion and RftG is that only Innovation scratches that "Magic the Gathering itch." In the prior options, card combos largely involve eeking out minor bonuses... but there's nothing game changing. With Innovation, however, certain cards are "rule breakers," with some odd swings and combinations. After two plays, we're only uncovering some of the possible synergies with cards. That's the MtG feeling... game-altering cards that allow you to bend the rules.

And yet, I grew tired of MtG because of the combative nature and the joyless approach that "serious" MtG fans took in the game. With Innovation, everyone shares in the same decks, and though there's direct conflict and interaction, there's also plenty of fun.

Update: two more plays, and this drops to a 6 and is trade bait. Yikes. That was one of the quickest plummets in my ratings. I think I reached that epiphany when I drew and "melded" a card, only to find out that I won the game through sheer dumb luck. I think it was one of the least satisfying "victories" I've experienced.

I really wanted to like this game, but the increasingly powerful abilities seem to cause the game to veer out of control. I think the other players felt the same way.

If thorough knowledge of the cards helps to create more tactical play, that's great. But I don't see this getting played frequently enough for me to reach that point. If I want "civ lite" in a card game, I'd rather play 7 Wonders. If I want to build a card tableau and activate card powers, I'd rather play London.

Update: traded it away for the Memoir '44 terrain pack. Ultimately, the "swingy" card effects outweighed all the other things I liked about the game.

I am generally a fan of Chudyk, but Innovation was just painful. Always having to see who had more of all the different icons just really dragged the game down for me. That sort of interaction and constant math just totally took me away from any sort of getting into the game. With each card having its own power you are constantly reading the abilities you have too and the entire game just felt like a lot of work to me as opposed to fun. I guess I could be persuaded to play again, but anything other than 2 players I think would drive me crazy as the downtime between turns would just be too much.

I enjoyed my first two plays of this game (3 player).  I appreciated the game's novel mechanics, things like splaying, and the card powers (dogma).  I worry that it is a bit abstract, and that every game I played / watched was won by a player who played an innovation that let them steal point from other players.  This lack of strategic breadth worries me.  I would play this again in a heart beat, but might not buy my own copy just yet.

The game's graphics remind one of the North Korean look of Age of Steam or some other title drafted on an Mac+.

(5/20/10) In no way a game that suits my tastes - lots of card knowledge required, engine building, randomness with not a lot of ability to manage it (except, maybe, with extreme card knowledge). That said, I actually enjoyed my first play to a certain degree. Played in a very low-stakes, loosey-goosey way, it was a fun endeavor - much like a game of Infernal Contraption might be if that game were more fun than it is. I didn't pay much attention to my majorities (wow that is a lot of counting) or what cards' actions were available (they just change too much). I just did the action that seemed best or attracted my interest and watched what happened. In the end, I think there is just too much information management and not enough of an interesting enough analytical/logical problem. Not one I need to play again.

Had this game for a while before finally bringing it to the table.  It took a play-through to get the rules down, and I'm glad we finally discovered it.  It's a fast-playing, fun, card-based Civ game that plays differently every time.  There's a bit of luck involved, and some cards can mess with opponents.  But it's quick enough that an unlucky game isn't a big deal.  I really like this one!

OK, I gave this another shot, and concluded that my previous rating of 2 was a bit ... churlish. I can at least see why some people like this game, even though I don't, and this isn't a pointless time sink in the way that other games I've rated at the two level. But I stand by my assertion that this is the most overrated game on the Geek at least in those games where the emphasis isn't Less Strategy, More Boba Fett.

My case against:

[i]Card draws are blind[/i]. It's almost impossible to target an overall strategy, because cards are whatever you draw off the deck. Compare London's card display, or Pax Porfiriana's card market, or Le Havre's set order of building proposals, or Fleet's license auction or Dominion's kingdom cards -- you have the ability to mentally draw an if-everything-goes-right strategic throughline right at the start, and minimize the degree that bad luck bites you in the butt. I'm not against games where it's hopeless to plan, but I tend to prefer those games to be short and punchy, and games of Innovation stop being fun for me long before they end.

The abstraction (I assume we have all accepted the fact that any pretensions on Innovation's part to being a "Civilization game" are laughable) of the game is a source of constant distraction. Insofar as I play abstract games (and, honestly, I usually don't) I prefer them to have a simple and elemental ruleset, and goverened as much as possible by raw skill.

Innovation is the game Double Fanucci was satirizing. (Oh, just Google it.)

I like plenty of games (see my Top 10) that are far more complex than Innovation, but grounding those games in theme makes all the difference. Innovation, though it has some good qualities, is ultimately the manipulation of signs without signifiers, leading to the arbitary crowning of someone as the winner. Some knowledge of the cards in the deck no doubt helps, as does instant recall of the many many ways to score "achievements" -- which are as distinguished from "points", for some reason -- but grinding away at a system and memorizing things is not the same as gaining skills.

Also: "dogma" is not a verb. Dammit.

Innovation is very close to what I consider a perfect game.  

1) It's easy to understand, you can learn all the basic mechanics in about 5 minutes or less.  
2) It offers a ton of replay value, since each time you play the game it will unfold in drastically different ways,
3) There is more than one victory condition available, and a variety of strategies to reach those conditions depending on what you encounter and what your opponents are up to
4) The game has a very nice feel of progression to it, as your civilization continuously becomes more powerful over time.  The technologies you acquire can become synergistic and represent more than the sum of their parts. 
5) It's a good balance between randomization and factors you have control over.  If you win, you may have gotten some lucky breaks but it was largely about your ability to take advantage of opportunities and make the right call.

The game is fairly balanced, but some technology combinations allow for runaway victories when finally put into place. A novice who is unaware of what they're doing can be completely dominated.  With players of similar skill, it's typical to have a close game.

I would consider this game a "must have" and I introduce it to almost everyone I ever play with.

Too random and abstract for me. In my favourite card games (RftG, San Juan, GtR) the randomness/luck is tempered by having a handful of cards with multiple uses(creating a bucketload of options/choices). In Innovation the limited amount of cards that go through your hand makes it feel like a game where stuff just happens. 
Also, easily the meanest game I've ever played. 'Brutal' was the word I used while playing. So since it is so random it feels like you're getting punched in the face by the game, and not because you are being outplayed (I was the one handing out the beating and instead of it being fun, I just felt guilty).

Caveat: I broke one of my rules and passed judgement on Innivation after a single play

RATING: 9
Fast to play in four players, fun and ingenious. I love the smart design of cards: part of the game mechanics is implemented by the way cards are graphically depicted, as some actions allow cards to tile in different ways, getting more powerful.

Raised to 9 as it seems addictive. A plus is that it plays differently when in 2-3 or in 4. In 2 is more like a chess-game (don't misunderstand: it still is a card game, so a little luck is always there), whereas in 4 is more a chaos fun. In 3 is really subtle!

The key to the game seems to be to pick a horse, ride it until it collapses under you, and if you have done a god job of planning, you jump on the next fresh horse ready to go.

At the front end, the game will feel like pure, swingy, chaotic form, but upon further plays you will find cards to counter other cards and tactics to counter other tactics to make the game feel much more give and take.  This is one of those games that begs for exploration rather than taking it at first impression (though I will admit my first impression was overwhelmingly positive).

I will echo what others have said about the splaying mechanic feeling familiar and innovative all at the same time.

Thanks DT Secret Santa 2010! This is a great combo game with a lot of variety packed in. Knowledge of the cards and potential combinations is going to be a huge advantage and the game seems to have the potential for a huge runaway leader issues with players of different skill levels or for players who can't get a good combo working for them. While the graphic design isn't beautiful it is functional. I'm looking forward to exploring this game a lot more. Based on 1 two player game.

I can't find this!  Where did I put it?  It got stuck in the wrong box when we left the country for two years.

October 19, 2015: I still can't find it--I just looked everywhere, and confirmed that I hadn't sold it.

update: did I check "previously owned" after I lost it, or did I trade it away?  Let's watch as I chronicle my growing dementia here in the board game comments!

A somewhat chaotic card game about building up your tableau, it seems to work better if you are in it to do crazy stuff rather than to outright win.

RATING: 10
Excellent!  Brilliant!  Yes, it emphasizes tactics over long term strategy and can be somewhat chaotic (especially in a four-player game).  But I don't care.  I enjoy it a lot.  The combinations are interesting, and I guess this appeals to the (mostly ex-)Magic player in me.  I'll basically never turn down an opportunity to play this right now, and don't see this attitude changing for a while.  

My only suggestion for this game is to use the partnership rules if you're playing with four players.  It makes the game more interesting to me, less of a "pile on the leader" type of game in that situation.

Yes, it is made by someone way smarter than me. Unfortunately, that does not make me enjoy the game. There is too much fighting and not enough theme. It's just not my type of game.

Edited 2/19/15: I played it 4 times last night/this morning. I'm getting the hang of it. It's still nowhere near my favorite game, but it has grown on me a little. If you are into crazy tableau building with lots of confrontation, you may find you love it.

I am completely baffled as to why this game was so popular in my old circle of friends. The mechanics (especially splaying) are clunky and dissociated from the theme, there's too much icon micromanaging and the card effects really aren't particularly interesting for the most part, up until the very end at which they become ridiculously swingy. No thanks.

Very chaotic and tactical game. It has an step learning curve and ideally you should know all cards and color/symbol distribution of each era to play well.
It is interesting although I prefer Glory to Rome to this one since in Innovation spreads too much randomness in each action.
The main problem is that some games are intrinsically boring. Some games are unbalanced towards... nobody? ... and become crappy for all players at the same time.

Fun game that has a great theme (civilization building). I find it can be quite random sometimes - particularly when you get into the later ages the cards become extremely powerful. So long as you don't mind having what appears to be certain victory snatched from you at the last moment by a particularly powerful technology in the hands of another player.

An instant hit!  Feels like an exploded/expanded San Juan with it's multi-purpose cards w/ special abilities & varying point values.  But that's where the similarities end.  (I probably compare it to San Juan, because knowing that game first helps out a great deal when learing many other card games.)  The card splaying mechanic is very cool and can be game changing.  The civilization building theme and individual innovations are very cool.

Preliminary rating after 1 play. I won, but it seemed totally random. Turns are extremely tactical. Try to find something good for you that doesn't also help others. I really didn't like the special achievements. They seemed virtually impossible, without some special card which makes it significantly easier. But in that case, why not just put the goal on the card and scrap the general pool of special achievements? To play well, you'd really have to pay attention to what every other player can do. But it changes a LOT every turn, so it seems at least more fun to just play based on your own cards, but then it's pretty dang random. And I don't think I'm interested in really trying to track all other player's cards. And since you don't see any cards players might play before they actually take effect, it's still way random, even if you are trying to pay attention. Interesting system though.

Update: I hear it's better with 3 than 4. I would be willing to it again with 3.

Update: this game stuck in the back of my mind for some reason, and I eventually picked it up. Partially because my family really liked Glory To Rome, but I grew tired of it. I tend to not like games with crazy cards that do crazy thing, but I'm finding that my family [i]does[/i] like these kinds of games, and I'm happy playing what the family likes. But part of the reason I tend to not like games with cards that do crazy things is that you need to play a bunch of times to know what all those cards are and do. But since my family tends to like to play the same game over and over (not so much my preference, but again, playing with family is great, so I go along), games like this do get better with repeated play. I still find it slightly tedious to have to pay attention to every card that every player has in front of them, but I see us moving toward a point where we have all the cards memorized, and will know what they do from title alone. The game is probably best for people who plan to play enough to get to that point.

Update: it's now a favorite of the wife & son. Replaced Glory To Rome as our 3p card game of choice. A couple of expansions into it now. Still a lot of longevity left I think.

Played two 4 player games.  Both times I wasn't able to build much and was under the thumb of other players weapons.  Significant down time between turns as well.  May be better as a two player.  Need to give that a chance before I write this game off.  Like the mechanics/idea of the game.

Oct 2010 - Played a three player game and it was better.  Game is all about finding a chink in other people's melds and then exploiting it.  Not sure if this is fun or just frustrating.

Can't resist it any longer.  I picked up a copy.  Plan on learning the cards more and figuring out how deep this game goes.  Hopeful that my wife travels there with me.

RATING: 8
In keeping with Carl Chudyks apparent design paradigm "Make everything broken and escalate from there", Innovation is a highly fluent (at times volatile) game of engine building where players need to switch from offense to defense in the blink of an eye. Players need to be able to react to opponent's moves while fishing for powerful card combinations themselves. Knowing the deck is essential to keep the emerging chaos in check. But is it fun? Yes, loads of!

It is hard to rate this game. While I really enjoy it a lot, I also find it very frustrating. The problem is that if you are doing well, you are generally doing fun things--playing interesting cards, executing interesting dogmas, etc.  If you are losing, it is often the case that you also aren't doing much of interest, making losing in this game particularly unpleasant.

RATING: 9.5
Permanent place in my top 5 favorite games for the past few years. This game plays uniquely every time with wonderful player interaction, shifting strategies and avenues of victory, and nearly endless possible combinations between cards that make the flow of the game fascinatingly unpredictable. The symbolic iconography and elegant mechanics with the five colors and multi-directional splaying add to the appeal of the game immensely. I love how the dogma effects reflect civilizations sharing or dominating technological and social developments on the basis of accumulated icons which represent the state of progress in various spheres of the player's civilization (civic, religious, military, economic, etc.).

One of the greatest things about this game is the relatively short time it takes to play - usually about 45 minutes to an hour, even with 4 players. We usually pull this one out when we only have a little time or need a filler, but it's always one we look forward to, and always satisfying - even when nuclear weapons come out and blow the world back to the dark ages with fission, or a player who was previously in last place benefits from the sudden emergence of environmentalism or the rise of the machines when A.I. and software come out. That part of the game adds an arbitrary element that makes it even that much more exciting and pretty funny when the loser suddenly becomes the winner, after the clear winner fails to secure a victory with all of his resources.

Deceptively simple in design, yet quite complex in its possibilities, Innovation provides an adequate challenge for any level of player, and lots of fun every time.

This is one of those games that pretty much demands repeated plays to get underneath it.  There are myriad possibilities and getting to know the cards is a clear advantage.

Players are each turn choosing to play cards, draw them, or use the abilities of those already played.  The goal is to gain enough cards in your score pile.  The one key thing to realize (which took us a bit too long to figure out) is most of this can happen by stealing cards from other players.

REVISED Feb 2014: Once we connected that this is ideal as a 2-player game, we liked it immensely and I think it's going to be a go-to for us.  Lots of great strategies to unearth.

RATING: 2.5
This game is primarily a tactical one where you don’t plan that much ahead strategically. The game’s own manual confirms that it is supposed to be like that, it says: "While long term planning can be done, it is often much more important to seize the best tactical option at any given moment."
However, the game has *a lot* of options. Particularly, it has 105 different cards, most of which have a long and often rather complicated text. After the opening of the game, most of the time each player has five different cards layed out in front of him that he could use (with a dogma action). Additionally, he has cards on his hand that he could play and use with a dogma action on his turn. Which means you have to read a lot of cards each turn which takes *a lot* of time. If you want to orient yourself and make a good play also considering your opponents possibilities to react, that is. Next turn, many top cards will likely have been replaced by other cards, so you’ll have to do much reading again, particularly with more than 2 players.
I suppose if you play the game a lot, at the time you know all 105 different cards and the ages they come in by heart, it’ll play more fluently. But 105 different cards, most of them with complicated effects – that takes a lot of games or memorising time! I *might* be willing to invest this time if it were a deep strategic game.
But the effects of the cards seem much too chaotic and unpredictably game changing for considerable long term strategic planning most of the time. (Yes, I realize that some planning is certainly possible.)
The cheap design with its ugly or rather practically non-existent art on the cards is a further turn-off.

Bottom line: Much too chaotic to be a deep strategic game, much too time-consuming with lots of complicated text and effects to be a light tactical game. Which results in the game completely failing in both categories as far as I am concerned.

I have a hard time explaining the positive ratings and comments here. I can only imagine that they are mostly by players which are OK with playing a game in "wing-it-mode" and have no desire to play anywhere near optimally, at least until they have played so much that they know all cards by heart. If you simply do something which seems nice at first glance and don’t even bother reading most of the layed out cards, it doesn’t take so long. If you like to play like that, Innovation might be for you. Otherwise, my advice is to steer well clear of it.

I'm very impressed with how this game allows strong board-position leaders to be toppled from their throne, yet counts that transient dominance towards winning (via achievements). 

I'm less fond of four-player games, partly due to the greater chaos between turns (though this can be mitigated with team play), but more due to the fact that card stacks run out so quickly that "teching up" via dogma effects becomes very weak.

Players seem to first get better at this game by learning basic principles ("more icons is good"), learning what cards/powers exist, and being less overwhelmed and so better able to spot advantageous combos. I have to figure out how much advanced skill is simply more of the preceding vs. deeper understanding of gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
Right now this is my favorite game. The ideas are pleasing to me, the learning is fun, and the mechanics interest me. I enjoy the hoping and the scheming.

When it is my turn to pick (I pick half of the time) half of my picks are Innovation for the moment. That is the most fitting decision for me at this time.

We let attacks hit once without warning the other player. Then it is up to the other player to figure out how to counter, unless they decide to soak it up instead.

I want to play this enough that we choose to go ahead and allow our opponent to do "our action" because we realize it will benefit us more or perhaps even solely if they should also do it. We don't do that enough so far I don't think.

I would entirely avoid this game. It purposely benefits the player with the stronger board shutting down the weakest one, who continuosely keeps losing cards / advantages / board power.

RATING: 6
Components: Lots wrong with these cards.
1. The subdued card colors are difficult to distinguish by their primary color names (e.g. “red” is actually a faint pink).
2. The icons are too large, and the text too small.
3. The unique icon for the card is unnecessary and clutters up the card.
4. The dominant icon (used to activate the dogma) should be larger; it's difficult to see those of my opponent.
5. The icons should have names; we had to make up our own interpretations just so we could talk about them.
6. Lots of confusing wording on the cards.

Experience: I had thought I'd read about this game as being in the same family as Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, and other games where the luck of the draw is balanced out by a growing tableau of strategic options. But Innovation doesn't share in the spirit of these games; it is a chaotic, ruthless take-that affair, where no card is safe.

I enjoy several of the clever mechanisms, including how using my own non-demand dogma can cause the opponent to do something they don't want to do. But it's also possible that using my own dogma will hurt me more than help me.

If I became more familiar with the cards, perhaps I would learn how to better defend myself. But in my three playings, my opponents and I could barely take a turn without some card moving from one side to the other, or a score card being stolen, or burning off a top card. Vicious, vicious, vicious. Even more chaotic with three than with two.

The game plays great and there are lots of options.
Both games I played had very strong cards come out early which seemed to guarantee me victory. The other player could have gotten a card to counter, but was dependent on the luck of the draw. 
It would probably play better with 4 players.

Wow -- initial rating after half a game, admittedly -- what a great and fun design. Though at heart its an abstract card game where cards trigger their effects across the table based on set-collecting and earning majorities, it still holds its theme quite well -- and who doesn't love a civ theme? Appears to be highly replayable. I could see this rating coming down if I decide that it is too highly tactical with strategic planning going unrewarded. But extra marks for it playing great with two or three players, and also for including a partners variant for four hands. NICE.

(11/2010 update) After three plays... still a 10.

Aside from generally not liking deck builders, of which this might be considered, the few games I played seemed far too much based on luck.  A few of the cards seem a bit overpowered and if somebody locks those up and often seems hard to block other players who have gained control over a "point engine".  Also, the theme seems to just be "tacked on".  The card actions are based solely on the symbols and having nothing to do with the technology listed on the card.  You could put any set of symbols on the cards and play it just as well without the theme.

This game presents itself as a deep strategy game but I'm not convinced. Luck of the draw is a big factor and the wildly swingy effects of certain cards can immediately invalidate a strategy you've been worked toward for many rounds, which I wouldn't mind if the negative effects of that change could usually be mitigated by smart play. But I think once you accept that you can't have fun playing this game while being too attached to your strategy (or even your success) and treat it more like a quick, casual card game, the unique narrative of each play can be pretty fun.

So far, I've played this game twice. I think the lack of imagery and aesthetics really draws people away from it. But I enjoyed those two play throughs, and I think the simplicity is nice. I need to play more to REALLY understand what the game is about and how it flows. I like the idea of building a "board" that constantly fixes itself as the game progresses. But I need more plays.

Edit: 7 to 8. Just played 3 more games tonight, 2 player. It was really fun. Once you get to know the cards and how the game truly works, the game flows nicely. Before I felt too limited by the separate actions between dogma and melding, but now it feels just right. The progress of innovations in this game really add to the theme. My cousin and I talked about each game after we finished and felt like we were building a progressive civilization from the concepts and iconography on the cards. Enjoyed it and I probably will enjoy it in the future!

Excellent game. This clicked for us on the first playthrough. This game has more player interaction than RftG and Dominion combined: stealing cards, switching cards from opponents hand/tableau, switching influence point cards, dogmas dependent on resources. And of course the brilliant splaying mechanism.

The theme fits nicely as the game gets more and more unstable/swingy the further technology advances.

Similar to Race for the Galaxy, this card game  seems like it should be played quickly, yet there are so many things to pay attention to.  I think RftG incorporates the theme much better than this game does.  As long as you can overlook this, it's an enjoyable game.  Because of the information overload, I think 2-player should be the sweet spot for this game, but I haven't played it with more than 2.

My only play through with 4 had lots of swings - almost too many. Some players suffered from not being able to collect enough symbols to activate cards or were the targets of other player effects. Some rounds had the leader shifting between us with every action taken. The only safe point is claiming dominance and seems to be a race to get there. I would play again but my impression is that this game has a lot of luck for the time required to play.

Joc per 2-4 jugadors (recomanen 2-3), de cartes, senzill, amb una mica de tot, molt tàctic (fer lo que puguis al teu torn) i força caos. Alguns el comparen amb el Fluxx (salvant distàncies). En el sentit que hi ha cartes de victòria instantània, o de girar la truita completament.
EXPERIENCIA 18/8/14: Només hem fet una partida SENCERA a 2. De sobte apareixen cartes molt burres (dogmes), que al poder-se usar 2 vegades poden enfonsar a la misèria a l'altre jugador. I el joc "es fa" llarg i "és" llarg. Unes dues hores, però hi ha moments en els que es perd totalment el control... i no mola. Potser falta pràctica.

It's great fun with two players, and I feel the mix of luck and strategy is just about perfect. Every turn the conditions change and you have to change with them if you want to win. Finding the right way to combine your cards to exploit your advantages (and your opponent's weaknesses) is the key, and the cards are well designed enough that there's *nearly* always something you can do, even when the situation looks bad. Four+ player games and three hour games are all well and good, but I don't get many opportunities to actually play them. This I can play with my wife for an hour after dinner, and that's just what I was looking for.

Box way too small to hold sleeved cards. Even w/o the plastic tray. Alternate storage for sleeved cards (including "Echoes") in Arcane Tinmen's "Dragon Shield - Four Compartment Box" for 300 cards, for example AT-20114 (yellow). You will then just need one of the game boxes for the player tablets and rules.

Initial reaction is that this game is complicated, tactical, chaotic, can lead to major analysis paralysis and there's not much in the way of catchup mechanisms.

I'm going to give it another chance, though. My first game was a 5-player game with the expansions which, according to the hosts, was a big mistake. I can see the AP factor being reduced somewhat with only 4 players.

I had fun playing it as two player.

Positives:
* Each turn your doing completely different actions with vastly different results.
* Enjoyed working my way up the ages whilst trying to balance scoring and tableau strength.

Negatives:
* Turns can be slow as you have to look at most cards in play on each turn.
* Theme gets lost or is barely existent
* One of those games that once you fall behind your not getting back up.
* Some cards just have too big a impact on the game. If your opponent gets these and you don't its game over.

There's some new and interesting stuff going on here: the splaying vs stacking; the dependency on your strength for the ability to leach off actions; the progression through the cards/powers building to big plays; the use of cards for a multitude of things.
But there are so many cards with so much text that its very hard to keep track of all the consequences of an action. There's a lot of leaning over the table to read & reread whats in front of every player. And that really bogs the game down and makes it slow and tiresome. Yet if you don't do that, the game becomes largely random where a win will come from someone not noticing how much benefit they're about to give you.
This kind of complaint can be levelled at many games and I usually dont have a problem (I love a lot of other text-heavy card games). Often its just a matter of playing the game a few times until everyone remembers and recognises the cards easily. But this one was too far for me. I cant see playing it enough to reach that point. Too much text for too little game play off for me.

Brilliant, but definitely a learning curve to see what's really going on. Seems like a chaotic mess at first. Don't let your first couple of plays sour you (and only play 2-player games initially).  Each game is always a unique experience and forces you to adjust to what is going on.

Don't neglect building your board at the expense of lots of early scoring. You will regret it later when you are stuck in the middle game...

Rating after a single play, may go up. I'm biased toward quick cardgames with a small footprint (Morels, Jaipur, Citadels, Sleuth) and this didn't disappoint.

Edit: After a half dozen plays I'm still not sure about this one. Clearly you have to have a lot of familiarity with the cards to get the most out of it. It's always enjoyable, but there's a sense that the game is playing you. Not because there aren't meaningful choices, just that the amount of text on each card, and the number of cards in play, can be totally overwhelming. 

Edit: After a half dozen more plays, this game is awesome. Granted, sometimes it's a landslide for one player and there's nothing the other can do, but it doesn't seem to matter. From a design perspective, I have no idea how a card can be totally broken in one game and totally useless in the next. Innovation is really about recognizing which card is good in the current game and forgetting about the last one. If you love tactics, this is as tactical as a game can get.

Edit: The game continues to improve. After some twenty plays I finally introduced an expansion, Figures in the Sand. I love it. This is the best card game ever, no hyperbole. 

Regarding my prior comment that one player can run away early, I've also seen more completely unexpected comebacks in Innovation than any other game. If you fall behind you should just think, "Oh, good, I get a chance to do something epic," and fight on.

I still can't raise my rating to a 10 because it is impossible for many players to enjoy, or for me to enjoy with AP prone players, like my gf. If people aren't willing to just 'feel it and go', even if that means not grinding out the optimal play every turn, this can be a torturous experience. It's definitely a gamer's game only.

EDIT: Innovation continues to evolve approaching thirty plays, and continues to share no common ground with anything else I've played. Brilliant and entirely unique.

EDIT: Another amazing session tonight. Nuclear war wiped the board one action ahead of my win. Then I came back and lost one action behind. Increased my rating to a 10. No game works with every group. With the right people, Innovation is perfection.

I like this game despite it catering to everything i hate about games.

I have a jillion cards. My opponent has a jillion cards. They all do something. My vision and memory are terrible. Awesome recipe, huh?

I think once you begin to remember which cards do what (rather than having to read every time) the game becomes a little more playable.

God help you all in a multiplayer game though.

Not a great game yet, but a very solid "Good" game.  I just need to have more practice at learning the combos.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a self contained card game about playing card combos (like Magic).  It is quite complicated to learn and tedious to play for the first 5+ times until you get to know some of the cards by heart.  Part of the problem is that the game is not very thematic (which was the reason I was first attracted to the game).  Another part of the problem is that the names used for the actions are weird (for instance, playing a card is called "Melding").  But the biggest problem is that new cards get played face-up on every turn, and these cards change the options available for play.  So while you're reading your cards and trying to figure out what they do ("Meld", "Splay", "Tuck", "Achieve", etc) with text that is sometimes poorly worded, other people are playing cards which affect you (and which you can sometime use).  The end result is that the biggest aspect of the strategy is to simply keep up with all of the options that are on the table.  This is a recipe for Analysis Paralysis, so make sure you don't play this game with someone who has to review every option before making a decision.  But even without AP prone players, it feels like work to try and keep up with all of the changes going on.  These changes are sometimes not subtle at all.  In fact, many of the cards that get played are game changing.

This leads to one aspect of the game which is interestingly balanced.  The cards that get played are increasingly powerful and chaotic, so as the game progresses, things can change quickly.  Although it may seem like one player has the game locked up, a card may come up that turns everything on it's head.  I normally think chaos is a bad thing, but in this case, it is a type of controlled chaos that makes the game feel very dynamic.  Just don't expect that dynamic feel to be connected to a theme, because it is not.  Sometimes your civilization moves forward, sometimes backwards, and always in a manner that makes no realistic sense.

So if you are looking for an abstract card game with tons of options (to the point of overwhelming), then give Innovation a try.  I can see why people like this game.  There is something very interesting to the abstract mechanics that lead to card combos.    But when it comes to abstract card games, I have to recommend Dominion over Innovation.  Dominion is simpler, and very likely has more divergent and interesting strategies (though I can't be sure until I play Innovation more).

RATING: 8
A very clever design that I had great fun with on first play - very close 2-player game 6-5in score. The card splaying and icon majorities is an excellent and innovative mechanic and for me the game engaged quite nicely with the theme.

The game is tactical rather than strategic in that you are working out turn by turn the optimal choices for your turn based on cards just drawn. My concern is that repeat plays will show that winning or losing comes down to the whim of the cards more than the players actions. But we shall see - looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 8
Have played 3x3-player, 1x 4player,  1x4 player team game and 3X2 player games now.

This is a brilliant game design. The game is infinitely replayable and allows for all sorts of planning and interaction. The system is clean and efficient and despite all sorts of complex card interactions quite uncluttered or confusing.

This is NOT the kind of game to sit down to and casually start in and hope to have any chance of winning! But it is a game which I trust will be more and more engaging as our gaming circle grows more familiar with the cards and process.

Sure, there will some times during the game when you feel absolutely devastated but there are ways to bounce back. It's also just plain fin to learn and play. 

Hope I get to play this dozens more times and the initial euphoric rating of 9 sticks!

Edit: March 26th, 2011: Played 5 more 2-player games and 3 more 3-player games and this game is incredible. Rating stays at 9 for sure for the 2-player version.

This game can be brutal and it is not for people who have thin skins as you can lose almost all of your points when an opponent draws the right card.

Then he drew the player with most leaves wins the game card and won before my wife could claim the 6th and final achievement.

Such a lovely card game.  All sorts of powers and combos to play with.  However, my game group is somehow a magnet for brokenness.  George in FF, Mike in TtA, we discover them before we come here and find that it's an issue.  Anatomy has now joined their ranks.  Other attacks (other than Gunpowder) have "I demand you be hurt but get a consolation prize".  Anatomy must be written wrong; "I demand you lose points and techs".  If it was "You lose points and I lose a tech," maybe it would work.

First play.  The guy with the castles ran away with it drawing insane amounts of cards and scoring lots of points w/another card.  Basically he bought the 1st 4 achievements and won.  We tried it again and the same thing happened.  There is one castle card that seemed broken.  We had to have gotten a rule wrong.  I rate it a 4 because I'd be willing to play again assuming we discover a key rule we got wrong.  Otherwise, this goes down to a 1 as it is broken.

Innovation is an exciting card game design by Carl Chudyk that I think is ultimately superior to his other well known design, Glory to Rome. This is not because I think that Glory to Rome is bad, I rate it a 7 and I think it is an enjoyable and solid design. I think that due to its similarities to Race For the Galaxy I can’t help but compare them and ultimately find Glory to Rome to be inferior. I understand that others disagree, and can appreciate it. There are some definite things to like about Glory to Rome (particularly some of the organic zaniness that the game), but I think the variability and depth of play that Race For the Galaxy provides pushes it to levels that Glory to Rome just cannot compare to. 

So what Innovation does is take some of the crazy abilities and organic feel of Glory to Rome and put it is in its own, easier to understand, game. The rules are far, far simpler than those you find in either Race For the Galaxy or Glory to Rome. There are four easy to understand basic actions and a symbol-set that is much easier to decipher than that of Race For the Galaxy or Glory to Rome. The only thing that really gets in the way of the game’s decipherability is the fact that each card has a different set of abilities and thus new text to absorb. This results in the game feeling more chaotic than it actually is, as it takes quite a few plays to absorb all of the options and paths the game has to offer, and get to the strategic and tactical meat that the game offers. At twenty five plays I only feel like I barely have a grasp on what is going on, and I am only now getting an idea of what some of the later cards do. Other, more studious, players will probably get to this point earlier, but regardless of how long it takes it is a lot of information to absorb. 

This constant tension between being forced to decide if you want to play cards or use powers that will help you with your current situation or the current board state and making decisions to build your infrastructure for the longer game is one of the main things that I like about the game. The cards have a nice mix between cards that will allow you to splay (reveal more symbols) and tuck (place cards at the bottom of your stacks and thus potentially give your more symbols) and gain small amounts of points or just put a new card on your board. And while each of these options also includes a bit of the other (short term gains will frequently help you long term and vice versa), figuring out which combination of long term or short term is ultimately better is fun and challenging.

While there are definitely cards that are better than others in the early game and the ability to gain a definite advantage over your opponents, the fact that the majority symbol of the early game (castles) goes away and other symbols (factories and clocks) appear later also allows players who are in a weak position early to come back for a win, alleviating luck and allowing players to come from behind even if they don’t get any strong early cards. It also creates an incentive for players to focus on either strategies that result in a shorter game (victory point/achievement rush) or longer game strategies (points or one of the unique victory conditions from the 9 and 10 decks). 

I think Innovation is a worthy addition to the highly replayable ability-based card game family. It is different enough from Race For the Galaxy/Glory to Rome, Dominion and the board game knock offs that it is a worthwhile addition to the collection of anyone who likes these games. Fans of Carl Chudyk’s works should be especially impressed. I rate it an 8, and expect that even as its plays climb that it will remain within 1 point of this value. Whether it goes to 9 depends on whether it continues to capture my attention and interest (like Race For the Galaxy) or fades away as its flaws become greater than its strengths (like Dominion or, to a lesser extent, Glory to Rome).

RATING: 3
Civilization based card game where players are trying to win the game, mainly through acquiring achievements.  Mechanically simple game where a player takes two actions for their turn.  Actions can be draw cards, meld cards, acquire achievements or enforce their dogma.  Draw and meld are sort of obvious.  Dogma is where things get interesting.... they action one of their melded cards, semi-forcing their opponents to toe the line.  The main objective is to get cards into their score pile, which is used to pick up achievements, which are required to win the game (usually).  Fun game, but some niggles - I felt like there was about 10% control and 90% ride in the game.  Definitely needs some more plays to refine the opinion - not sure it will get them though.  Repeat plays have confirmed - you can't take this one too seriously, it's a chaotic mess.

I don't want to hype this one too much, since I'm friends with both the designer and the publisher.  But I like it a lot, and I hope it does well.  It's a fair bit more chaotic and fluid than Glory to Rome, and not even really in the same genre other than being a rules-on-the-cards game with lots of unique cards (110 or so), but I think it will appeal to a similar audience.  Each turn presents many options, some of which might change the game position drastically, and it's a fun puzzle to find the one that works out best for you.

"empire building" with cards. I usually play with 2. I got creamed my first game ever playing this, and I was hooked. I lost so badly I just had to play it again to see if I could win. It is imperitive to learn how the cards work together for tech advantages. you will want to decide often if you should build up your board to get points to score or raise havok on your opponent side of the board and steal his.

Each card has different powers, so the learning curve is a little high, sort of like Race For The Galaxy.   There is a lot of direct conflict in the game, so it gets a reputation for being chaotic, but I think its more volatile than chaotic.   Your scoring pile is basically defenseless, and you need to claim achievements when it is over the current high water mark.   It takes some effort to find the right cards that will enable you to score (at all) and that can be frustrating.   Graphically, it's a very ugly game, which is a shame, because it could have a lot more appeal if only it looked better.   Might not be a short game with AP-prone players, although I know it can move quickly too.  (P.s. the iello version in 2013 solves the ugly problem).

Nagyon szeretem egy játékban, amikor a kártyalapok különböző kombinációs lehetőségeket biztosítanak. Ketten próbáltuk ki, ami a legjobb játékosszámnak számít és elöljáróban elmondom, hogy nagyon tetszett a játék, viszont sértődősöknek nem ajánlott, mert brutálisan lehet benne egymásnak keresztbe tenni. Fordulatokban gazdag a játékmenet, egy-egy kártyalap kijátszása teljesen megfordíthatja a játék képét. A többféle győzelmi lehetőség különböző stratégiáknak ad lehetőséget. 105 kártyalap különböző képességei biztosítják a változatosságot. Egy-egy kártyalap nagyon erősnek tűnik, de csak egy bizonyos stratégiával szemben, viszont könnyen át lehet térni egy másik stratégiára. Szóval aki kedveli az interakciót a játékosok között, a kártyák kombinációs felhasználási lehetőségét, annak kifejezetten ajánlott. Arra még szeretném felhívni a figyelmet, hogy AP (analízis-paralízis) veszélyes, ami elnyújthatja a játékmenetet, viszont minden percét megéri. Az angolja szerintem nem vészes, pár kulcsszót kell megismerni, azok ismétlődnek a kártyalapokon. Azt hiszem, hogy kiadtak belőle egy `deluxe` verziót, ami tartalmazza a kiegészítőt is (legalábbis egyet biztos :)). (2018.01.22.)

Innovation is an absolute blast with the right people. People who are angered by randomness or suffer from severe AP will make this game an agony. Go in with a chill group who focus on making fun decisions instead of optimal decisions and you'll see how crazy things can go.

While 2-player is far more balanced and controllable, I earnestly enjoy the absolute mayhem of 4-player. I'm eager to pick up the expansion (expansions? I think I heard there were more these days?)

What I am looking for in a game has changed over the past two years. Rather than a story, I now often want space to think about an interesting problem. Innovation offers this in spades, so gets bumped to an 8. It might be Chudyk's master piece, not because it (at least at the moment) is my favourite of his games, but more because it is unlike anything else. In a landscape where so many games are just remixes of other games I have played before Innovation is really fresh.

First play was highly meh; seemed entirely abstract with moving/sliding cards around to no real purpose.  The alleged Civ theme is a joke.

What can I say about Innovation?  A card game that takes you from the invention of the wheel to the internet.  For the most part, people I've met either like it or hate it.  Count me in the former category.  Great mix of luck and strategy.  Don't be fooled by the people who say this game is all luck.  A good player will beat a noob 99% of the time.  But every game you play is random enough to give you a new experience.  That to me is the mark of a good game.

nice game - we may have played slow but it really takes a little too long for what it is. (only played 2 & 3er so far). 2er is more quicker and better as it feels to have more control and plays at an appropriate length for the depth of the game.

pluses - nice way of working card combo's to your advantage with the illusion of some strategic control.

negatives - a LOT of beat on the disadvantaged which seemed to lead to a point where you just have to play out the game with little effect on the outcome at best and as a kingmaker at worst.

I like the game, i'm happy to own it, since it is kind of a unique game, however i can't really see pulling it out over Uruk or Glory to Rome, but i will happily play it if others request it.

A well designed card game driven by a plethora of icons spread across the play area. At times, this game can be an absolute disaster of confusion, but this usually occurs near the endgame, when a winner is evident or there's been so much screwage that it doesn't even matter. Very fun, but overwhelming for beginners. The first two expansions combine to create a more complicated game with great variety. Generally the base game is good for a few plays and the expansions creep up the setup and play complexity past enjoyment. Very mixed feelings about this a few years in, I'd like to see a redesigned player mat that has all the rules clearly laid out for players.

30-60m, best with 2 players. 10+ plays.

RATING: 6
Innovation is an interesting game where ones board situation (score/abilities) is constantly changing.  This is a highly tactical and interactive game.  More so than a lot of the other 'high profile' card games that have been released withing the past few years.  When you start the game you have one power which will have 3 icons.  From there you get 2 action points on your turn which can be used to draw, lay a card to your tableau (this costs no cards just 1 action), get a victory condition (you need 6 to win) if you have the proper amount of score value, or use a special power.  You are only able to have 5 varieties of cards on your tableau, so if you play a blue card, that card will be placed over the other blue card on the table unless you have no blue cards and then you just start a blue pile.

So what do I think of the game?  Well, it's highly chaotic and the game feels very fragile with very little control in the hands of the players.  I won't say that this is Fluxx and the game plays you, but I feel that the way the cards come out and when certain cards are introduced can result in huge swings in the game.  It's very hard to prepare for cards even ones that you know are coming up based on the luck of the draw.  That being said, the game is pretty good and it's certainly different from everything else out there.  I think it's more fun just to see the way games can unfold more than having a high motivation on winning the game.  I think the game is best played with 2.

Beyond the game feeling a little fragile, I should also caution against the fiddly set-up/breakdown of the game.  In addition to that the game usually takes up a fairly large footprint on your table based on the fact that there are 10 decks of cards and once you start splaying mass cards, or have 15+ cards in your score pile, it becomes a little unwieldy.

Lots of randomness but in a way that is manageable and creates interesting tactical play, rather than that randomness reducing players' ability to affect the outcome of the game. In addition to the fact that getting to know the cards well after multiple plays can help give players further strategic decision-making this game creates a very unique style of gameplay that does not suffer from having lots of randomness.

RATING: 10
I find it fascinating how well this game brings the idea of inter-relatedness and context into focus.  It’s not that “x” or “y” card in and of itself is overpowered or game breaking.  It’s true that, at times, so many of them can be – but it’s also true that it is completely dependent upon the context in which the card finds itself in relation to the rest of your [i]and[/i] your opponent’s tableaus.  What nets you a win in one game can be the cement shoes that sink you in the next. 

It’s what makes the game feel so chaotic and even random at times.  It’s also what tempts you to believe that this is a luck-based game.  But I don’t think that's true.  I think that what the game does is challenge you to be able read and understand that related-ness, that context, and then act or react accordingly.  

Bluntly, even with a simple rule-set, it’s an enormous challenge as no two cards are the same.  Still, I'll say this, if you don’t immediately reject Innovation as “not my style of game,” then get ready because the epiphany train is getting ready to roll as there are endless layers and nuances to discover.  It's quite the masterpiece.

My first play of Inovation left me a little disappointed. As  find negative information more helpful I'll start with that. The game has that combos feel like GtR has, unfortunately, I do not like all the symbol matching and counting that has to be done by both players to decide if an action will work for them or not. I also disliked the bland nature of the cards. I also found a lot of the verbiage to be overly confusing.

However, I did see some stuff in there I liked, and with more plays, I'm fairly confident I'll find a decent game.

I only played this once, 3-player, but I found it chaotic and very annoying.

Half the time, the "interaction" consists mostly of looking at the onboard situation and peering through your hand of cards trying to find some combo that will give you an abusive advantage over one of your opponents.  The other half of the time, it consists of desperately peering through your cards trying to find something that will stop the abusive combo that your opponent has you in.  I don't like my tactical games to be so dependent on what happens to be in your hand at the time.

[1 play] This was not at all what I expected. I was expecting something really unique and interesting.  What I got was a somewhat Fluxxy card game with little to no civilization-building feel to it.  

One thing I’d heard on BGG that made me very wary was complaints about the cards being difficult to see.  I don’t have the keenest sight, and have had some potentially good gaming experiences pretty much ruined for me by sitting where I could not see essential game elements.  But when I saw how this game is, it wasn’t such an issue for me.  There are more than 100 unique cards, each with its own special effects.  As the game goes on, each player builds up a tableau of cards in front of them. Ideally, you would want to know what cards the other players have down, since they can implement the powers of any of those cards on their turn, and you could be affected.  But I just decided early on that this was a learning game, and I was going to be occupied paying attention to all the cards in my own tableau and hand, and I was OK with not knowing what the other players were going to do until they did it.  It would indeed be annoyingly difficult to be constantly trying to read everyone else’s cards upside down and remember what they all are, especially as some of the color backgrounds are not the easiest to read upside down at any distance.  

I think that where this game would most shine would be if a group played it enough to get to know all the cards and their functions.  Then you’d only need to be able to read the card titles, which are in large bold print, or it’d be more practical to announce those as they were played.  If you knew the game well enough, you’d just need to know/see/hear that your opponent was playing Rocketry, or Writing, or whatever, and you’d know what that did.  I think the game could be enjoyed playing on a really casual level, as I did, and not bothering about what all the card effects were, or on a serious, much more informed level, knowing all the cards.  But in between, I can see how people could find it very strategically frustrating because of how time-consuming it would be to decipher all the information that could affect your plans. 

The game had a Fluxxy feel to us because many cards allowed people to do really sweeping things, including destroying huge chunks of what others had accomplished.  You progress toward victory sort of in two ways: first, you have a scoring pile to which you add cards with values between 1-10.  Second, you use your score pile to capture achievement cards, of which there are 10 (one for each of the 10 ages in the game).  There are also 5 special achievement cards, sort of wonder of the world type things, which can be obtained by meeting unique special conditions.  You win by getting 5 of these 15 achievement cards (in a 3p game, which is what we had).  

So in our game, one person was clearly ahead the whole time on the scoring thing.  When the second player finally got on the board with some score, the first one did some sweeping move that allowed him to steal it all away from her.  Meanwhile, I was focusing on the special achievement cards, and managed to set up the special conditions to bag four of them.  This was a successful tactic because mostly nobody realized what I was doing till I did it, and once you have achievements nobody can take them away from you (unlike your score pile, which can be attacked in various ways).  I was then able to win by getting a regular achievement for my 5th one, which took only about 2 turns because I had a card that let me put my whole hand (and I had a lot of cards in my hand) into the score pile.  

The notion of the ten ages was clever, but the theme didn’t feel strong.  And I think the drastic shifts helped undermine any kind of civilization-building feel, because this game very much didn’t feel like you were successfully building anything up over time.  It was more a bunch of wild random smitings where anything anyone did could suddenly be completely destroyed.  

If we played this game again, we’d all have a better idea of how to maintain some strategic balance of power.  And the game might rise to a higher level if you took the trouble to learn all the cards.  But it didn’t appeal to me enough for me to pursue it.

Fast and furious and a bunches of fun.  This game is all tactics no strategy, find an advantage and exploit it. When the advantage disappears find a new one. Tons of back forth take that.  Unlike other games, Innovation's "take that" is light and enjoyable -- no hurt feelings.  Not only are you taking it, you're also dishing it out.  Would love to try it with some of the expansions.  The game becomes more enjoyable as you gain understanding of the cards.

Learning this game felt like a chore, even though the core rules are relatively simple. The early game seemed pretty solid, with potential for good strategic play (especially with two players). But as the game progresses, the game gets more and more chaotic. Winning the game is pretty dependent on card draw, and it feels like early-game actions have almost no bearing on who wins.

This is really not my kind of game. If I were to play something that is pretty random, I'd rather play something with better production values and a stronger theme.

I get a kick out of the tactical back and forth this game provides. The theme comes through well on some cards more than others, but they come and go too quickly to dwell on it.

Prefer Glory to Rome to this.  I like Innovation's symbology and basic play, but the card powers seem unbalanced, making someone start churning points too easily until someone comes up with some other killer card that smashes them to pieces, all feeling arbitrary and out of pace.  If the game lasts long enough (and if doesn't it means someone just rolled over everyone), the cards become more and more overpowered, making it feel like a washing machine spinning out of control (which is perhaps the thematic point (and indicates a view of the universe by the designer) to the game but I don't find it enjoyable).  Still, there is something appealing about it and I find myself interested in playing again.  I think I only played with 4, so I guess I should try with a lower count.

By Carl Chudyk, designer of Glory to Rome, and features similar tactical fun.  A civilization-themed game with 105 unique technology cards, each with special effects that players use to earn points and achievements.  Keep an eye on this one folks, it could be a hit!

It's more fragile and luck-driven than Glory to Rome and harder to develop long-term strategies because it's more tactical, somewhat chaotic at times, and card draw can be important. But the combos and plays are so much fun, and if that's what people like about GtR, they'll find some of that here too. It does take a few plays to get familiar with the cards and technologies, but the basic rules are very easy, despite having some innovative mechanics.
I recommend this game very highly - if you're looking for a solid game that features strong card management, and where every card has a unique ability, and where you're going to have a ton of fun using your technologies together in innovative ways, then Innovation is for you.

DON'T PLAY WITH ANYONE THAT APs. This one is tough to explain to new players, and one needs to explain off that bat that "you probably won't 'get it' until after your first game is OVER." That makes it hard to get this one to circulate amongst a group. It's a pain to have to teach this one over and over again, and doesn't get good until everyone has a clue about what they're doing. If you get to that point, however, it's an awesome game.

Once I got past the card art and realized that actually I had no problem reading icons on cards across the table because of the utilitarian face of the cards, I had nothing left to complain about in this game. (In fact the art on the card backs is great.)

It is so simple, yet has so much to offer. My wife likes it and is talking about tactics for the next time we play.

While the 4p game can be a bit swingy and random feeling, I've been finding the 2 and 3p games to be tense fights. I was skeptical after my first play, but this game has been revealing itself to me after sticking with it for a few more.

Fun two-player card game.

I like the card splaying aspect that open up and reveal additional capabilities.  Not only do you have to be aware of your capabilities, you also need to be mindful of your opponent.  Fun to see the additional capabilities as the game progresses through the different ages.

Could be challenging keeping track of everyone's cards with more than two players.

At one time I had this game rated much higher.  It can be incredibly fun, addictive even, if you are winning, or if it's a relatively balanced round.  However usually, at any given point, one person is clearly on top - that's wouldn't be so bad, except that anyone not on top typically cannot partake of any of the  fun actions or dynamics of the game.  I will no longer play this game one-on-one.  I might be convinced to play with 3 or 4.  MIGHT be.

Played 3 times.  This game is crazy fun!

Edit 5/26/10.  I've now played a bunch of times:  7 x 2player, 3 x 3player, 1 x 4player.  This remains a very fun game, but it definitely has the potential to bog down if people feel the need to thoroughly consider their options.  4 player, especially, felt like it ran a bit long, though admittedly I was the only one who'd played before.  It seems that until all players have played enough to know the ins and outs of the cards, it's a lot more enjoyable if people don't think too much, which may naturally turn some gamers off.  But the mechanics are so clever and the game is so wildly addictive that this is a must-try for anyone who can deal with randomness and chaos.  I'm keeping this at a 9 because, at this point, this is a game I would never turn down.

RATING: 6
A surprisingly complex, and dare I say, innovative card game, that took me two full playthroughs before I started warming up to it.  The civ-building aspects feel a bit too abstract for me, and some of the cards feel either completely overpowered or worthless - though I'm sure with enough plays, one might find a way to counter any overly powerful particular card or a subtle use for a seemingly weak one, but this hasn't seemed to be the case for any of our games yet.  Still a fun  and interesting game for me, and it seems to always last just long enough to get invested, but not drag out.

RATING: 9
Having played Innovation (the beautiful [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1440811/innovation]English 2nd Edition[/url]) for the fourth time, I can safely rank it at a solid 9. It is a pocket civilization game, full of discovery and a sense of increasing empowerment. Card effects frequently feel broken and unfair at first sight, and players who are expecting eurogame-style balance may get offended. But there are always counterplays and defenses available for the creative player. The game can be learned in five minutes and the design is elegant and very satisfactory, with the possible exception of the five "domains" cards, which I find an unnecessary complication. All in all, right now I enjoy it more than the famous [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19857/glory-rome]Glory to Rome[/url] by the same Carl Chudyk, also an excellent, and probably superior, game.

[b]One of my two favorite games. So much variety from game to game, and such a fun challenge. The 3 player game is fun, but fairly random; as a 2 player game, this is just stellar.[/b]

Rating history: 6|8|8|10|10|10|10|10|10.......|9.|10

1st play: 6. Apr/14, 4p. A hash - we thought you could splay cards from the very beginning (and thus saw no value in any cards that allowed you to splay). No one had any fun, and it felt like there was no control (4 players). I imagined the game WITH the correct rules, and still wasn't feeling it. Apr 2014.

2nd play: 8. Apr/14, 2p. The next night WITH correct rules - and wouldn't you know it, I had a lot of fun. I see what people mean when they say that you need to play the game a lot to understand the possibilities (which will give more of a feeling of control), but even it's my newbie chaos phase, I find it fun to play as a tactical game. Apr 2014.

3rd play: 8. Jul 2014, 2p. Hadn't played in a while and it took a bit to get the hang of it again. At least I finally won!

4th play: 10. Aug/14, 2p. WOW! This game finally clicked! I *LOST* 6 achievements to ZERO, and am still bumping this up to a 10!

5th play: 10. Aug/14, 2p. Taught it and lost again, still a 10.
6th play: 10. Aug/14, 2p. Taught it again...and lost again.
7th play: 10. Aug/14, 3p - Taught it again, and my first 3p game. The game is FAST with 3p, but still fun. More "I demand..." opportunities.
8th play: 10. Aug/14, 2p.
9th play: 10. Aug/14, 2p. Best playing of this so far. Down 0-4, then tied 5-5, I won 6-5 with a Special Achv. TONS of scored cards, very little raiding.
10th: 10. 3p game. Fission to zero out a splay leader. Alt condition for win! 08/14
11th: 10. Solitaire, using http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/573834/solitaire-mode-it-was-inevitable . Very challenging!
12th: 10. Solitaire. Self-Service for the win.
13th: 10. Solitaire. AI genetics into Robotics (with AI and Software on the board!) and 29 points. I was at 30. Next turn win. Phew!
14th: 10. 2p - Behind 2-4, I raided D's score pile with Vaccination, then Empiricism alt win (20 bulbs).
15th: 10. 2p - Early splays plus lucky Optics gave me a quick lead I rode to victory.
16th: 10. 3p - Tucked 8 to score 8, giving me two Specials for the win.
17th: 10. 2p - I scored early and often, getting achievements 1-4 very quickly. Then I Evolutioned into some 8's to finish the game 6-0.
18th: 9. 2p - It finally fell a notch. It was a 10 while every game played out differently, but now some gzmes have similar "feel". Still, an incredibly fun, tactical game.

20 plays in: 10. One of my two favorite games. So much variety from game to game, and such a fun challenge. The 3 player game is fun, but fairly random; as a 2 player game, this is just stellar.

A card game that is chaotic, strategic, and very interactive. Easy to grasp.

It has a card mechanic of "splaying" that is new to me.  Cards work together well.  Getting to know the cards is helpful and speeds this already fast game up some more. 

Thumbs up.

RATING: 6
My opinion of this has improved over time.  After a poor first play, I revisited a few years later, it definitely got better.  However, I do not like this with 2.  A lucky card draw can send one player into rich-get-richer, and the different icons are not balanced in terms of how they affect others.  Better with 3 or more so that Dogma potentially impacts only 1 other player.

However, with more players (like 5 for my 2017 Gaming Hoopla play), it becomes a bit chaotic and very random.  I had 0 score for most of the game, then dogma'd my way to 36 score in one turn.  Had the game not ended, I would have achieved twice the next time.

I think 3-4 is best.  I've played with 5 using the Echoes expansion which was fine, although 5 was chaotic.

I enjoy the light civ theme and relatively quick playtime, during which you ponder the vast number of options available. Despite being a chaotic game full of powers, Innovation still gives you some semblance of progress and control.

You can get shut out, and the game is very tactical. There are some situational card combos, but not to the extent of Glory to Rome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[2 plays] I don't know how much faith I have in this becoming one of my absolute favorites, but just in terms of game design, the last time I saw a game so obviously brilliant was Napoleon's Triumph.  

The civ aspect, although completely abstract, came through a lot more than I thought it would if sometimes seeming almost too fluid.  I really felt like our civilizations were clashing on many different levels and leveraging the relative strengths to maximum benefit. It's certainly interesting to see an attempt at anything of the sort in such a short period of time.

Having only played Glory to Rome, I already sense a clear Carl Chudyk signature in this game.  Though not mechanically similar in any way, fans of GtR would do well to consider this one without playing first.  Like GtR, all of the cards seem utterly broken at one point or another, but work together to make this completely insane, unpredictable whole.

Love it. Obviously in the same vein as Glory to Rome: a lot of cards with huge, game-changing abilities that you want to break in as many ways as possible. Structured enough not to be something like Fluxx, unstructured enough to feel creative. This treads the unstructured line a bit more than Glory to Rome but it does it right and is better for it.

This has stuck around and been played over and over for years at this point. Deserves a 9.

Oct. 2012: Had to stop my first game due to time reasons after being half way through. However, I was impressed. Might finally be a perfect 2 persons card game that my girl friend is willing to play with me.
Update April 2013: unfortunately not. Still, uptdate to 9. I cannot remember a game where I've ever gone through so many emotional ups and downs during each single game.
Jan 2018: now that it's available for online play on BGA I played it again after quite some time. 
I'll stumbled upon a recent review by user fragasnap, which reads as follows:
"The problem is that there is no long term planning. Everything is so volatile that if you have anything that can be exploited, you just exploit it until it doesn't work anymore. If someone else has something better than you, you try to get as many cards in your hand so that you can break another player's exploit.
You can't even rely upon finding a particular card since one is removed from most eras at the start of the game." 
This summary is completely correct. However, while he gave a 2 , I'll now upgrade to 10, as exactly this - for me - makes it not the best but for sure the tensest game I've  ever played (apart from possibly Pandemic Legacy 1).

I don't mind the pasted on "theme" or the unnatracitve cards but this is a a poor excuse for a strategy game.  It rewards memorizing the deck more than tactics, planning or strategy.  Your first play will feel essentially like fluxx, but your friends will convince you that no; it's actually a deep great game that puts Race for the galaxy and mottainai to shame.  So you try again.  Halfway through you get tired of reading 10 different cards each turn to figure out what exactly is going on so you just start guessing at moves ti you're put out of your misery so you can play something else.  Trusting your friend's analysis you'll play again and again but the promised payoff never comes.  Even when you learn the cards, it is a load of "I hope he doesn't have that one card!"  I don't like that you got to know most every card in the game by heart before you can start REALLY playing.  Other games knowing the deck helps, but you can make smart decisions without it - and you can stand a chance against an experienced player.

Nagyon jó az alapmechanizmus. Mind a splay, mint a coop/supremacy dogma hatalmas ötlet. Azt egy kicsit sajnálom, hogy ennyire kaotikus játékot építettek köré. Nem bánnám, ha egy kicsit kevesebb lenne a kitolós és több az építős akció, mert akkor tervezhetőbb lenne a játék. Az alapötlet szerintem jobb, mint a rómában, de az összhatás gyengébb a hatalmas káosz miatt. Ki kell próbálni hármasban is (vagy négyen csapatban), mert sok helyen írják, hogy a négyes kezelhetetlen.

Szimpatikus volt még, hogy annak ellenére, hogy elég absztrakt kártyajáték, nagyon tematikus tud lenni néhány lap hatása. Ha valaki előbb fedez fel valami nagy dolgot, akkor egyértelműen előnybe tud kerülni. Ahogy feltalálják a puskaport, úgy pusztulnak le a várak a világból stb.
8.1
------------
A harmadik játék után sajna visszább kell vennem az értékelést. Vannak benne egyértelműen, minden helyzetben nagyon erős, és nagyon gyenge kártyák, és ez eléggé nagy szerencse szerepet visz a játékba. Pl. a combustionnal gyakorlatilag egyedül meg lehet nyerni a játékot, míg sok olyan akár 7-8-as kártya van, ami lényegesen gyengébb, sok akár 1-esnél. Rómában is van hasonló, de ott simán beépíted a gyengébb darabokat nyersanyagnak, nomeg pörögnek a lapok, de itt simán beragad a kezedbe több gyenge is, mert aránylag nehéz húzni, és a gyengéket, se könnyű kiszórni.

Ezen felül négy fővel csak csapatban ajánlott a játék, mert különben akkora a káosz, hogy kezelhetetlen, és elkerülhetetlenül királycsinálás lesz a vége.
Illetve a spéci domination kártyákat annyira nehézre csinálták, hogy szinte lehetetlen megcsinálni őket.

Ambivalens hát az értékelés. Mert egyfelől semmihez se hasonló, spéci, absztrakt mechanizmussal sikerült egy nagyon tematikus játékot csinálni, de közben vannak bosszantó apróságok, amik beárnyékolják a játékmenetet.

-> 7

Nem jó ez a játék. Full random, full hullámvasút, látszatdöntésekkel. Kár érte, mert zseniális alapötletekre épül. Kéne Chudyk mellé valaki, aki rendbeteszi a játékait.

RATING: 7
Innovation's card effects can be outrageously strong, even if compared with the already fairly ridiculous effects in Glory to Rome. That certainly makes the game more chaotic, and large swings of fortune are the norm rather than the exception. It may sound contradictory, but at the same time it is very hard to come back once you have fallen behind a bit too much.

If you're willing to accept that at times the winds of change will simply blow you away with nothing to do about it the game can emanate a certain crisp charm that other games of its class lack. Plotting the best course of action in an anbundance of ridiculous effects is at any rate a challenge, and while I'm not sure there is a way to win there is certainly more than one way to lose.

After watching Tom Vasel's review, I wasn't sure what to exect. He warned that, at first play, this game may seem to chaotic. And he was right. 

One player (who eventually won), got a good combination of cards, and racked up a high score pretty quickly. He even managed to steal an achievement from another player by playing his cards at the correct time. While I did feel like I could slow him down the dogma on some of my cards, I felt like that would only drag the game out, without giving me a better chance to win. 

This game may be better with fewer players (2 or 3), and with more familiarity with the cards. There are some really interesting concepts here, but my first impression is "only slightly better than Fluxx".

Very interesting and highly complex. Unfortunately it can be very dry and many rounds turn into so much of an AP-fest  that inviting new players becomes more of a personal struggle of "Do I want to make this time commitment for a game that is just shy of being worth it?"

[i]Nov 2014[/i]: Adjusted rating to 6.
[i]August 5, 2011:[/i] First impressions.
A brilliant game, has a slight edge over Race for the Galaxy (and this coming from a RftG and sci-fin fan). Don't let the 'simple and 'clip-arty' art fool you. In fact, the simple iconography makes it easy to scan and count the icons in play at any time. A meaty game that plays quickly (under an hour, and likely around 30 minutes for veterans). I felt I've played an epic civ game despite the short play time.

Looks like this is best with 3 players, OK with 2, but probably too chaotic with 4.

This is a sorely under-rated game (7.3). This is a solid '8' and definitely has the potential to reach a '9'.


[i]August 8, 2011:[/i] Tried the solitaire rules by GameRulesforOne. Quite challenging but not impossible to beat the solitaire engine, "The Ruling Party".

A solid 8+. This game is on track for being upgraded to a "9".

Second time I played it, I feel it's really a good game, full of variant, and you can win by any method.

I am trying to figure out how this is more than a sloppy, slow, take-that card game.

The problem is that there is no long term planning. Everything is so volatile that if you have anything that can be exploited, you just exploit it until it doesn't work anymore. If someone else has something better than you, you try to get as many cards in your hand so that you can break another player's exploit.
You can't even rely upon finding a particular card since one is removed from most eras at the start of the game.

Also, counting symbols is a nightmare.

This is quite a unique card game and very different than anything else I've played. There is almost an unrelenting amount of chaos in this game, but there is definitely decision making that goes on and good, critical choices to be made. Almost a purely tactical game, however, as even mid-range planning is almost impossible. A lot of text to keep track of as well, and this can slow down the game. Overall a fun, interactive, and thought-provoking game that captures a civ feel in 100 cards. Almost too chaotic for my supreme enjoyment, but a nice game for two or more as long as you don't get mad easily. There is tons of screwage!

RATING: 6
As a 2-player game I'd give this a 7.5 - fast, with a race feel - trying to score those VPs as the game slowly gets more chaotic and swingy - really fun.
BUT....but 3+ players it is HORRIBLE...like horribly horrifically, game-stoppingly bad. Games trudge on far, far to long with endless checking and double checking of other players abilities. It's a hot mess.

RATING: 8
After a bunch of plays, I'm still not sure about how much strategy there is.  Knowing the cards is an advantage, but not really necessary to play well.  Instead, there are some basic tenets that should be followed, and even then a new player can pull out a win.  I enjoy playing the game a lot, but I'm not sure if it's more Cosmic Encounter or Glory to Rome (meaning I don't know if varying card powers lends itself more towards unbalanced, Ameritrashy goodness or towards balanced strategic/tactical choices). 

Innovation works best as a two-player game.  More players make dogma actions more powerful, thus incentivizing them, and more dogma actions prevent strategy (or add randomness), which I think is best avoided.

RATING: 9
My favorite from Carl Chudyk. Chaotic like no other but so much fun. The game changes pace in an incredible way and the weakest player can squeeze a victory given the right combination of elements. Every single card in the game is different and the synergies they create are endless. This game is very "innovative."

Stupidly chaotic. Reminded me of Battle of the Bands but without the fun. Takes the strategic element of Glory to Rome (the patrons) and throws it away, replacing it with semi-random screwage. Uno has similar gameplay but is 10 times as fast - so in the end what's achieved by all of the rules?

Awesome game. I like this spiritual successor to Glory to Rome even more. The rules are easy to learn, and the splaying/tucking/melding mechanics plus a huge variety of cards keep the game fresh. Pretty sure I'll be playing this one for years to come. Not good for anyone who dislikes confrontational games though, as some of the cards here are truly nasty >-)

This game is so fun that I don't even mind that it can be a little mean and/or swingy.  There are SO many different paths to victory and the best path varies every time.  The art is really good in the new edition and it really makes the game very thematic.

Unnecessarily tricky to teach.  The game seems awfully random and games seem very dependent on who is able to draw the best combo (earlier is preferable).  

I will agree experience helps with this game as it will not confuse you with the vocabulary and neither will you have to search hard for worthwhile combos.

An interesting idea but I don't find the execution great.

I like the concept of the game but it feels like if someone gets a good power card that they can run away with it.  Granted that's after one play, but that was enough to sour my game group.  I don't see this one hitting the table again.

A really clever card, civilization style game. I love the depth in this one, multiple ways to win, lots of powerful cards to use

I was surprised to find it plays best at 2p, I will have to give that a go online. Usually I play 3p live and it works well. I've done 4 before but it makes the game a bit more chaotic than I'd like

Definitely a game that could be bumped to a 9 if I can get in deep in the 2p end. Also the new expansions add very interesting new and cool elements to the game

Innovation er et af de mest interessante spil, jeg er stødt på i de seneste år og et af de mest spillede hos os. Spillet har et element af kaos, som sikkert skræmmer en del væk, men efterhånden som man kommer til at kende kortene i spillet, der alle er unikke, bliver man bedre og bedre i stand til at kontrollere kaos. Et spil med mange veje til sejren, et spil med masser af interessante kombinationer, et spil der både giver mulighed for strategiske overvejelser og i høj grad fordrer evnen til taktiske beslutninger. Et fabelagtigt spil - men bestemt ikke et spil for alle! Spillet der får mig til at bryde et gammelt - og åbenbart i mine egne øjene et forældet - princip om kun at give et spil 10!

Chaos.   I don't like Chaos.  However, this game has me giggling the whole time.   It has one thing I LOVE in games:  the "big play". It has that over and over again throughout.  

If taken too seriously by the AP-prone then it can really bog down and take too long to play.  With the right group, it's fine.

The "Echos of the Past" Expansion doubles the number of cards and makes it even more extreme: bigger potential plays and even more chaos. if your group can handle the additional complexity without totally bogging down to a crawl, then you may find it fun.   However, for some it will be too much of an occasionally good thing.

RATING: 9
Have never played anything like that before (although reminescents of Glory to Rome (GtR)are clearly visible).
Chaos with big C. Managing that chaos is an art.
Somehow the atmosphere/theme of GtR is closer to me. The chaos generated there - is fixed, there are more and more buldings giving more and more stuff. Here ,,buildings" are changing, some dies, some are born. Constantly. Every turn. It's not - my previous bulding makes a combo with new one. It's rather - now, my newest bulding is making a combo with previous and changes yours.

It's not for me, although I enjoyed the game quite a bit.
EDIT
Bought after playing Glory to Rome several times. Will see if I will love it or like it.
After second game (1st with 2) - I like a little more.

EDIT
OK. I love it. WIth evenly experienced players it's a great combat of skills, courage, cold blood and... luck (it's a card game isn't it?). :)

Waaaay better than glory to rome.  enjoyable card game that played very well with 2 in my only play.

After my third play, my opinion of the game has dropped drastically.  Yes, you're never out of the game because it can swing so wildly with just one great card.  Yes, it has some innovative mechanics.  

But: it's impossible to read the other player's cards and so it's too easy to slip a card onto your board one turn and surprise the player with it the next.  I don't want my opponent to read me the text on every card since that would extend the game far too long.  I can't imagine playing this with more than 3 players, and I don't think I even want to play it with 2.

I'll have to play more to figure if my worries are founded, but until they are, I'll be very happy to test them.

Preliminary rating, 2-player. Cute, but potentially chaotic. We'll see.

Two more plays, both 3p. A big sprawling mess of splayed out chaos. Definitely a 2p-only game for me, and even then, not enthusiastically so. Lowered rating.

At this point, my fear is that the game has two kinds of endings: Runaway Leader, and Late Game Crazy "I win!" Lucky Draws.

Update: Played more than a year later against a relatively experienced opponent, my fourth play total overall, and I bumble into a crushing victory using L1 Agriculture. My fear from a year earlier proves all too true.

RATING: 2
I *really* wanted to like this!  I played 4 times, winning twice.  I like the idea, but the game is far too busy and the decisions seem shallow.  Luck of the draw overrides any sense of strategy.  The decisions usually amount to scanning the cards to identify the optimal action for the turn.  The cards are so diverse and specific in effect that it is a real pain to remember what your opponents have available, and re-reading their cards each turn would drag out the game intolerably.  Far too often it's "Oh, I wouldn't have done that if I knew you were able to do that."  Disappointing, given I really like Glory to Rome, and this looked promising.  I'm glad I didn't rush to buy it.

This isn't a bad game...however I feel there is simply so much going on that you really can't have a long term strategy. If you take the iconography on the cards as an indication of the type of society you're building, (ie: agricultural, military, scholarly) There are dogma effects that switch this instantly. The theme fails in this sense. 
I do enjoy the interactivity with other players, but basically you have very little control over what they do to you as well as what you can do for your own civilization. 

People who enjoy chaotic 'screw you/vice versa' card games only. 
(I enjoy Race for the Galaxy and 7-Wonders more.)

This game was easy enough to teach when I was still relatively new to the hobby. However, there are a lot of possible strategies for such a quick learn. Yes, luck of the draw can play a big part. There's some powerful cards that can make the game swing wildly between leaders, but I consider that part of the fun and excitement. Great things come in small packages and there's a lot going on here for just a box of cards.

really fun card game. may start to challenge RftG as my favorite card game.

Update: 15 plays in and I am a bit surprised by how few of the cards I am remembering.

I have a new found appreciation for the iconography in RftG after playing this game. So nice to glance at a card and know exactly what it does.

It's best as a 2p game I think.  Some learning curve, especially with the terminology.

I don't love how sometimes you just feel like there is no hope, and you're just getting your ass kicked all over the place.  It can be infuriating.  You can get pinned quickly if you don't watch out.

I do like the how swingy the game is - turns on a dime, and that thing that you thought was so awesome becomes obsolete very quickly.

It's very well designed, and I could play it over and over and not get bored.

More chaotic than Race for the Galaxy or Dominion, but big fun! Good strategic depth under the standard rules with 2 or 3 players who are familiar with the cards. But the best and most strategic way to play is probably 4p with the teams variant (presented at the end of the 2nd edition rulebook). On the other hand, the standard rules for 4p lead to totally unstructured chaos with an essentially random result. It's really amazing how bad this game is if you play standard-rules 4p vs. playing it any other way....

A marvel of game design!

Innovation is an outstanding, intense game for two players. It features a rapidly-changing game state that is full of surprises and allows for creative, clever, and multifaceted moves. But unlike most games with this level of chaos, Innovation is a very think-y, gamer-y game. The more you play it, the more you'll see the scope of the strategy and planning. It's the opposite of something like The Princes of Florence, where you carefully map out a long sequence of moves that will last you until the end of the game. In Innovation, your plans are constantly changing. Adapt and improvise, or die.

With three or four, I have trouble tracking what's happening on the other players' tableaus, so Innovation plays as more of a fast, loose, crazy, chaotic, un-serious game at that scale. Which is still fun, but I do prefer two players.

With four, use the partnership rules: partners play independently and must earn a total six achievements between them. "I demand" card effects do not apply to your partner. Other card effects apply normally, but you do not get the bonus card for sharing if your partner is the only one who partakes.

A kooky civilization game in all cards that is simultaneously lighthearted and strategic.

This game has a high level of complication and frustration for a relatively low level of enjoyment/fun payoff.  The rules and strategy are difficult to teach.

My first two games lasted a little longer than I wanted them to. I have hopes that this game could be played in 30-45 minutes. With experience, maybe I can. As it is, turns take some time because there are so many options.

So far, that is all I can say negative about this game. I love it. So many options. Great combos. Different strategies. You have to constantly adjust and improve. You can't rely on a single strategy through the whole game. Very thought provoking. Very satisfying when you play well.

Even better that the author's first game (Glory to Rome) because of more overview, better iconography, less fiddlyness and more player interaction! My only complaint is drawpile No. 10. There are cards in it that ruin the game or with other words, a player that achieved nothing in this game (gained no influence) may win with the right card. I don't like game ending that way. If you played well during the game you should not be the loser in the end (Tree card). Rating after one 4 player game with second edtion. I am looking forward to a german edition of this one.

Bought the German Ed. after 3 years wait. After another play I clearly had to downrate this game from 8 to 7 as overpowered cards were not fixed.

RATING: 7
Very combo-driven game, with a lot of moving parts and a brain burner. Things shift fluidly and you need to be constantly aware of your configuration and that of the opponent. Choices are suboptimal if you don't know what the other player has and is capable of doing, therefore knowledge of the cards is paramount. Not for the faint of heart! Yet it is a highly interactive, razor wire card game which will hold your attention till the end, and things in the end truly snowball.

This is insane game design. There's so much chaos and different cards, it can be tough to learn. 

The "splaying" mechanic is great, and something I hadn't seen before.

Personally, in my first game another player stole all my points and that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, but there seems to be so much replayability I would give it another shot.

Frustrating. Feels like the connection between actions and their results is far too vague... it's not exactly random, and skill clearly helps, but it's like trying to type on a keyboard using yardsticks.

Dec 2014: Now that I've fallen for Impulse (by the same designer) it is a little tempting to go back and give Innovation another try. Those memories of having high-density antifun with this game sure do linger, though.

May 2015: Succumbed to temptation. I like it, but people play so much more fluently when they know all the cards that it seems less elegant than the other Chudyks.

RATING: 8
Another Carl Chudyk card game. I absolutely love Glory to Rome, though it took a while to figure it out. My initial impression is that innovation is a bit more tactical due to the lessened permanence of your infrastructure. The varying scored in 6 categories triggering dogma effects differently is interesting and I'm not sure I have fully internalized the full ramifications of it yet. We'll see how this holds up after a few more plays.

Rating updated to an 8. This game definitely gets better with more plays.

A very nifty little civ-building card game.

Players put down cards to display different icon. Different buildings make use of those icons in different ways. The combinations are surprising and fun. The game plays very quickly, but is very satisfying.

A big plus for me-- after one game, my wife *loved* it.

I play this game regularly with a friend during my lunch break. It works perfectly as a 2 player game that we can get through in 45 minutes. 

I greatly prefer it with just two players. With more than two, it feels too chaotic, and many of the games come down to arbitrary win conditions at the end of the deck. The games also tend to get bogged down and drag a bit.

With two players, we rarely get past the 8s, and the game is won with basic achievements and one or two special achievements. 

It's nice that there's no one strategy that you can reliably fall back on. Every game is different.

Innovation is an interesting engine building game. Cards can be played to your sets, determining draw ability and action ability or potentially scored as influence to meet certain win conditions. There are many cards in the game and each on has a different ability. Fortunately, each card draw is generally an action, so players rarely have too many cards in their hands. This makes decisions easier, but also very limiting. In this way, the game feels to play itself. There is little opportunity to counteract a powerful card elsewhere on the table, and if you receive one such card, there is little reason not to activate it as often as possible. Additionally, the mechanics are simple, but how to do each mechanic is over complicated. What is essentially a draw/play to tableau game is skewed by over-complicated methods. I can see how someone could enjoy Innovation and seek out many plays, but the lack of agency and high obstacles to get into the "flow" are jarring. Innovation is unique, but in unappealing ways.

I can tell that this game will get better with more plays, but I'm concerned that it will be tough to get to the table.  I've only played a few games with me lady, but she has made it quite clear that she doesn't like the game.  Admittedly, I'm not too crazy about it either, but I think the game deserves more plays, and definitely some 3 or 4 player games too.  Having more players will make the choice of whether or not to activate a Dogma effect more juicy since it may be worth it to have you and one other player benefit, but not the other(s).
---
So we played this game 4 times this week and each play helped us appreciate this game a little more.  Skyrocketing from a 6 to 9 over the course of these few games has shown that this one grows on you.  We still aren't well versed in all the cards and their effects so there are still a lot of surprise Dogma effects in our games, but that's part of the fun.  I expect we'll play this one more often since the set up and play time is quite quick.  Even thinking about the new expansion, but I think we should have a lot more plays of the base game before we graduate.

RATING: 6
I find myself playing this less and less.  The mechanics of the game are interesting, but there's just not enough reactive player interaction to hold my interest.  By [i]reactive player interaction[/i] I mean the ability to react to the strategy that my opponent is playing.  My opponent has leaf superiority.  What can I do about that?  Well, nothing really, except hope that I pull lots of leaf cards or hope that I pull the right splay-dogma card or whatever.  I can't react to the game's state in a strategic way.

So if Innovation isn't strategic, perhaps it has interesting tactics?  Well, not usually.  The problem here is that card flow is so slow, and actions per turn are so few, that the tactical options open to you are usually very limited.  So, limited interesting tactical decisions, even fewer strategic decisions... why am I playing this game again?

This card game has very distinctive mechanisms. It is fast moving and very strategic. As with a lot of card games I find the balance issue is better addressed with > 2 players. There is less of a probability of one player getting all of the best cards. Of course, also players can work together to slow down a player who has ca significant early advantage. I own the first two expansions and feel they add a lot to game play although they do take quit a bit if additional setup time.

Excesivo caos hacen que el juego sea incontrolable y que no puedas planificar ningún tipo de estrategia. Parece que el juego juega solo y tu simplemente eres una mano inocente que hace saltar una cadena de acontecimientos en las cartas, parece un Fluxx.

A finely-crafted game. It's got chaos and control, very unique mechanics (splaying is thoroughly original, the "sharing" is extremely fresh) and slightly more traditional ones (hand-management and throughput concerns), quick playing time, lots of interaction... 
If you hate games with lots of (manageable) player interaction, Innovation isn't for you--but otherwise, it is. Belongs in everyone's collection for its uniqueness and variety.

After just over 10 plays (spread out over several months) I increased my rating of this game from 8 to 10. It really is a very clever and unique game. Nothing quite like it. It's got an AMAZING amount of tactical depth and is a very welcome addition to my collection. 

Other games may balance strategy with luck but Innovation balances order with chaos; Chudyk broke the mold with Innovation!

EDIT: dropped to a 9 because I have to consider the ugliness of the cards and spelling mistake in my copy. poor presentation. actually, I prefer the original to the new illustrated version and I like the minimalist approach, but it is still kinda lackluster. it is what it is. fantastic game!!!

Played more than one version, but that doesn't save this pile of crap at all. First off, this is all about cards that you draw from the top of a pile = pure randomness. Second, most abilities just shake the game completely, there is no control at all.

Draw random cards, get a random power you're often forced to play, attempt to keep track of the other players wildly fluctuating cards whilst attempting to make sensible decisions for yourself. Far too random to make particularly meaningful choices, even decent powers often end up a crapshoot due to card draw. I am assured the 2 player version is better and experience improves the games by reliable sources, but I still have absolutely no desire to go back to this one.

I've played it now six times and I must agree with some advice given both here in Geek and inside the box as well - Start playing with less than three. I've only played two player so far and the number of things to keep in mind is hair-raising at times.

I definitely recommend this one. It scratches my brain in quite a different way than any other game I've played. The means out of a dire situations are many times already available, but you don't recognize them immediately. Makes for some nice a-ha moments.

This game is by the same designer as Glory To Rome, and it shows.  The cards change the rules dramatically, and often affect each other in big ways.  But cards are in stacks, and only the power of the top card in the stack takes effect, so it's much worse than Glory To Rome -- the rules can change too quickly.  For example, you may think that you have a plan for your next turn, but someone may steal a card from the top of your stack, or force you to play a card on top of it, thus removing its power and ruining your plan.

I guess if I knew the cards better, I could plan better and so I might like the game better.  But it is worth it when I could be playing something else?

RATING: 7.5
A tableau building game in which players manage their hands, tableaux and score piles in order to accumulate achievement points.  Players draw from ten incremental decks, play cards to their tableaux, try to establish dominance in six symbols and execute actions ("dogma") which are unique to each card.  The mechanics interact well.  Actions can affect other players significantly.  Some of the actions involved at the tenth level seem to be a bit extreme.

Really like the way the game plays, and the elegance and simplicity of the system.

Mind you the first few games may appear to be chaotic, until you learn what it is you need to do!

GET 5 different colored cards out ASAP, and splay, but don't neglect the dogma effects, as some are pretty good!!

It would be best to have a majority in at least one icon category, least you give your opponents an opportunity to act when it is not their turn.  ;)

RATING: 9
At first play, Innovation felt like a hot mess. There were symbols everywhere, loads of text, it wasn't clear as to how you might go about applying and maintaining leverage, or how you'd respond to your opponent's constant jabs. I still feel like it's a hot mess, but a Buster Bluth "hot mess": this is all-over-the-place in a good way. The game is not chaotic but rather creative with a grand  variety of tools at your disposal. After some games, there becomes a method to the madness, a narrative amongst seemingly non-causal relationships. And that's when the fun really begins. Do you tech up, score run, do you vie for an early leaf rush, deal in tableau-disruption, establish splaying comboes? The cards become your tools but don't fully dictate your play.

Furthermore, as abstract as the game is (for a game that is Civ-themed), the individual cards and their abilities mesh rather well. Pottery, for example, greatly represents the longstanding tradition of breaking pots (i.e., returning cards) for ceremonial purposes (i.e., scoring points) to enrich the soil which you would harvest later (i.e., draw a card). Don't get me started about how well some of the cards, and the ideas mesh. The famous drunk monk strategy (i.e., fermentation + reformation)? Totally Trappist.

I wasn't too sure about this one to begin with. It took a few games to wrap my head around some of the different possibilities. I actually like it quite a bit now. There's no way to bring a consistent strategy to the board just because of the random nature of how the cards come up. There's a lot of critical thinking involved as you decide which cards to play and when.  I would probably say that this is by far the most competitive game we have to date.

I would like to play it a few more times to get the feel of the cards better but Im not sure who those plays might be with.

This is a game that I can understand why people like it, but it is anathema to me- it feels like a deep game where you need to spend some time to figure out strategy, but experience does very little to ameliorate the chaos and terrible game balance.

have heard it is much better with the expansion, but I"m unwilling at this point to give it any further play. Also, artwork is shite.

RATING: 9
The best gamey game I know.  Also, I've probably played this more than any other game during my adulthood.

Innovation is topical and not experiential in a concrete sense.  You will not feel like you are guiding a civilization.  However, the game does have something to say about each component Innovation, whether it be trite or otherwise.  For instance, the medical innovations tend to be as aggressive as they are yellow.  There's something to think about there.  

It is a game that requires literacy and creative critical thinking.  I wonder how lawyers feel about the game and whether those in the Constructionist camp might appreciate the game more or less than those who are in a different sort of woods.  

The presentation of the version I have feels very adult in a cross-boundary-beyond-the-standard-gamer game way.  I do not think the game would have the same appeal with a different presentation.  

The expansions (green and blue are all I can type of) are worthwhile for the consistent player but not necessary for appreciation.  I prefer to play with everything, these days, but can understand how a more competitive player would prefer to stick with the basic set and be satisfied.

The game is exploratory within the constrains of the contained game field.  That exploration is where I get my pleasure.  Thus, I have yet to find another game that better suits that desire.  

The one draw-back is the lack of dialogue pertaining to the broader subject of innovation and human experience.

It starts super slow and after a little playtime you will start to develop like when a bomb explode. The gameplay can be a bit chaotic (it is 100% guaranteed with more than 2 players). I like the game mechanic, love the multi use cards in such a clever way. The numerous endgame conditions are also welcome to go with. The iello's edition theme and artwork is outstanding. Carl Chudyk made another great game that i want to play. However i like to play Glory to Rome and Race For The Galaxy so much more and this is just because of those elegant gameplay.

Pros / Cons:
-Innovative game mechanic feels fresh right out of the box.
-The cards are in high interaction with each other which is almost always welcome.
-Because of the numerous endgame conditions you always have a slight chance to come back and win. So even if you feel like loosing just remember to never give up!
-Outstanding artwork in relation of the cool theme.
-Great price/value with the needed replayability.

-The chaotic gameplay sometimes destroys the fun. Im missing the elegant gameplay of Glory To Rome or Race For The Galaxy from this one.
-The interaction between the players can be irritating, especially when your enemy doing dogmas you can't stop.
-I feel balance issues which can be easily solved if the game went through much more playtesting.

A game with all the trademarks of a Chudyk game: multiple paths to victory, dynamically unbalanced, play verging on crazy, really clever game mechanism.

On the basis of two solo plays, I'm not sure I love this one quite as much as I love GtR, but it's got huge potential for similar madcap play, and I definitely think it will be rising with additional plays.

The one complaint so far is that there can be a bit of a runaway leader factor, but I wouldn't expect that to happen too frequently, due to the many sneaky engines possible with different board combinations.

Increased to 7.5 after 5 solo plays- I NEED to teach this one to my daughter.

Increased to 8 after 10 solo plays- better than 7.5!

I've played Innovation a few times.
+ Card splaying mechanic is innovative.
-  There's a lot of picking up your opponents' cards and reading fine print, and it's easy to miss effects, especially in 4-player games.  In contrast, I felt that Race for the Galaxy had a lot of reading at first, but there is more commonality among card effects, and you don't have to read your opponents' tableau as much.
- There's a lot of randomness and unpredictability toward the end.  You can influence the outcome, but at times it feels like nothing you did mattered.  Some people like this aspect.
= First edition card design was terrible, but judging by pictures, it seems to have improved in the third edition.
Overall, feels a bit heavy for a game with as much luck as it has.

Excellent tactical hand management game. Crazy combos. Does feel a little samey after awhile. Feels a bit Martin Wallace-y to me with its predefined progression. This game more than almost any benefits from knowing the decks as there are specific timings for different strategies and counters that you need to rely on to play well

Best with 2-3

(07/13/2010) Another card game where each card is multiple things, from the designer that brought you "Glory to Rome". Ugh. Glory to Rome was frustrating for the first handful of plays, but I continue to not get overly excited playing it. I was not overly excited about playing this.

I now know why I can't stand these types of games, because they require knowledge of a number of unique cards, each which has unique capabilities. This means playing the game a number of times to get familiar with what is in the deck.  Glory to Rome, Agricola, and Le Havre all make me suffer with having to know each card (and its unique mechanic) if I am to play well. While Dominion has considerably more cards to have knowledge of, it introduces them to me ten at a time, and the same ten cards are repetitively played over and over within the same game session, thus allowing me to rapidly familiarize myself with them. If I overlook a card in the other games, I will clearly be inducing sub-optimal play on myself, and I will not know about it until an hour or two later. This is frustrating.

Anyway, the text, numbers and iconography soon had me regretting getting in on this game. The theme was totally lost on me, as this felt like flowchart optimization. I will avoid it like the plague the next time, as I am not willing to invest the time and energy to play this effectively. I am just not feeling the love. It's a "4".

Update (01/26/11): Who am I kidding? Never going to play this again. It's a "2".

Note: We played this quite a bit prior to when I created my account.

Perhaps this is just our play style, but the only viable opening strategy appears to be rushing for the higher ages as quickly as possible. Most times I feel as if the first half of the game is completely inconsequential.

This causes a decent percentage of our plays to get incredibly lopsided due to luck of the draw. While there remains some opportunity for the losing player to get back in it, this happens too often for my taste.

I think this game is close to broken.  The game is too random to come up with any long term stratagies.  The winner is the person the happens into cards that work together.  The theme is pasted on at best.   Also for the life of me I will never be able to follow the rule that says have fun.  Choatic and teadious at the same time. Pass

Played it at Capclave 2012 and found that the text, and having to read it as well as keeping track of everybody's symbols... it was boring. Nonetheless, I decided to buy it as it is so well-regarded as a good two-player game. 

[b]Update:[/b] Ok, I've played it with Keri and I can definitely see how it is better as a two-player than a four player. Adjusted my rating based on that. I think, though, that it has a huge flaw in balance. 

[b]Update2:[/b] Woah, I missed the rule where you could only advance if you had a top card at or higher then the card you are achieving. Pretty big rule to miss and we played a lot of sucky and unbalanced games because of it. Much better now that we're playing it correctly!

This fall into the Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, "complicated card game that rewards multiple plays" category. If I actually played this game regularly with a group that learned the rich nuances that may exist in this I might rate this higher. But I have to be realistic. But I have to rate this game but on how I actually play it: with long stretches in between. You need to know the cards, know how they interact, understand the "arc" of which cards are good when, know when they stop being good, etc. I am extremely unlikely to ever play this game enough to reach that level. Which, unfortunately, makes much of the "fun" academic: the game comes across as a series of random "I just played a card that lets me screw you over and you didn't even know that if you had played some other card two turns ago you could have prevented it" sequences.

As thoroughly addictive as the other big recent card games (Dominion, Race).  Here though, the card effects are much bolder--even more so than in Glory to Rome.  They're so crazy sometimes that it's amazing that the game doesn't just rip apart at the seams.  Occasionally it does, although that's the intent.  If no one has won after making it to the 10 deck, the game could end in one of many different ways.

Right now I'd rate this a 9+ with 2 players.  With 3 players, it seems almost there, but the age stacks get depleted too quickly, so I'd rate it a little lower.  With 4, everything's very chaotic.

RATING: 9.89
Fifty plays into Innovation, I finally got it. I got how to manipulate the deck, how to make it go toward where I wanted, when to rush and when to score and when to meld. And I started winning like crazy. Because playing Innovation is like riding a sandworm. You get your hooks in a big one, you let it take you where it wants you to want it to go until it gets tired, then you dismount gracefully and search out another. And if you get your hooks in wrong, you’ll be chewed and spat. Get a good set in the worm and you keep riding, as long as your tableau has ride in it.

Just watching a game of Innovation is bewitching: splayed colors move left and right and up, shift from hand to score pile and back again, trade boards with seeming freedom. Playing Innovation means building up your icon stock, then throwing a rule into the works that you’ve saved back until you had the icons to support it. And then you ride that rule until somebody else’s rule throws you. Maybe till your own does. Ideally, you set up rules in all five colors and then start enforcing them like a lady with a beating stick.

It’s like having a brawl on the outside of a launching Saturn V. All game long you try to squeeze advantage out of landscape that constantly redefines itself. You can be overpoweringly strong, then someone gets a tech advantage on you and turns your tech level into a liability. Sure, you want to reach higher tech eras, but you also want to be buying achievements, because a win on score if the tech eras are rushed out is an embarrassing way to go. You really can win from almost any position in Innovation, but knowing the cards—even more so the eras—is the only foundation for doing so. The more you play, the more the chaos diminishes, and the more the game becomes a finely controlled dance, seemingly chaotic to those who don’t understand the context, beautiful to those who do. Innovation is [thing=589]Wiz War[/thing] for cultural anthropologists.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

This is a great 2 player game.  We used to play a lot of Race for the Galaxy, but this game has taken over that niche for us.  Every game is different and tactics change with every new card.  The randomness in the game is a plus, as it gives plenty of opportunities to come from behind or counter an opponent with a significant lead.

This is very chaotic.  I appreciate games in which cards have special powers, and this is that above all, and the way that icons are used is pretty unusual (the player who has the most of a certain icon can execute an ability; if a player who doesn't have the most icons attempts to do so, others can execute it first), and of course, "splaying" is pretty fun, though it is difficult to do in the game.  But it's awfully difficult to have much control, and when it can pretty easily get to the point where there's no real way to win. (1 play)

RATING: 6.6
Innovation es un juego con cartas, hermano de Gloria a Roma, en el que se "desarrolla" la civilización humana de manera muy abstracta y condensada en 1h. de juego con 105 cartas para representar el recorrido a través del árbol tecnológico humano (desde la agricultura y la rueda hasta la bomba nuclear).

El objetivo se logra principalmente dominando eras (varía su nº en función de los participantes). Para ello, hay que llevar cartas a nuestra zona de puntuación y estos puntos se usarán para lograr dominar determinada era (10 en cada partida desde la prehistoria hasta la edad de la información). A razón de 5 puntos por nº de era (15 para dominar la era 3, 25 para la era 5...)

Mecánicamente es muy sencillo, ya que hay cuatro acciones distintas de las cuales podemos hacer dos por turno (iguales o no), a saber: robar carta, jugar carta, dominar una era o ejecutar un dogma. Es en esta última dónde la cosa se complica. Con ella se activa el texto de la carta jugada en la mesa, semiobligando a los jugadores a hacer lo que en ella se requiere. Y hay 105 cartas. Todas distintas. 

Me encanta la mecánica de "arrastrar". Las cartas se van jugando y apilando en función de los 5 colores que tiene, y cuando se "arrastra", fruto del efecto de la otra carta, desplazas el apilamiento, de tal forma que dejas visible parte de las cartas inferiores, mostrando más iconos que te harán lograr más recursos..

Pros: La mecánica del arrastre. Ingeniosísima. Que dependas de tu fortaleza en determinada habilidad para poder aprovecharte de las acciones de los otros cuando activan sus dogmas. La progresión a través de las cartas y sus poderes/dogmas que te permiten ir haciendo mejores jugadas y combos (si te gustan los combos, este es tu juego). El uso de las cartas para multitud de cosas (son eras, puntos, recursos o poderes en función de dónde/cómo estén colcocadas). Interacción contínua sin llegar a ser puteante. Edición muy cuidada de Homoludicus que mejora la original. Un juego para 2 que es profundo (no debería probarse a +3 jugadores, a no ser que te guste el Double Fanucci). 

Cons: La sensación que lo único que haces es adaptarte a lo que te ha tocado es total. Hay demasiado azar y situaciones cambiantes, lo que hace muy improbable poder jugarlo con algo de estrategia. Muy abstracto con el tema de la civilización absolutamente pegado, ya que no suele haber relación entre el nombre de la tecnología que has jugado y su efecto en la partida. Iconos por todas partes. Conocer 105 cartas para poder jugar decentemente. Parece que estas constantemente contando: símbolos, puntos, multiplicando x5, leer las cartas de los oponentes, leer las propias cartas, no sé si todo esto deja tiempo para disfrutar de una partida.

Yuck!  I was tricked into giving this a try by the comparisons to Pax Porfiriana.

Not even close!  This is a weak family set-collecting/melding game that's random and boring.  Even the rules indicate that you won't really be able to use a strategy, with gameplay instead being reduced to taking the most tactically advantageous move at any given time.  Civ Fluxx.

I bought this since it had good ratings and was recommended, but I am disappointed. We have played it twice, and both plays are more confusing than entertaining. The theme is ridiculously weak, the gameplay is extremely random and the cards are so complicated that it is not comfortable to play. I know it may get better with many plays, but it does not invite me to play more. It will probably stay on the shelf from now on. If the theme had been stronger, supporting the gameplay, then I think it could have worked.

I like this far more as a two player game than a three or four player game.

This game is a great Chudyk game, which means plenty of chaos, a lot of interactions between different abilities on cards, and a mistaken impression that a given combo is imbalanced. It's not imbalanced, you just haven't found the right counter for it yet.

I like Innovation a lot, and it's up there with Red7 as my current favorite from Carl Chudyk's ouevre. Two player games play quickly, are deeply strategic, and can have massive come from behind victories. You are very rarely completely out of the running in a game of Innovation, and there are interesting moments where early game cards are suddenly stronger in late game than they ever were in the early game.

I wish I got to play this more, since it seems to really reward extensive replays. Might need to look into setting up a partner to really get into this.

I find this game really interesting and surprisingly simple despite all of the (seemingly) complicated terminology. I like how quickly the game plays, I like the ideas, I really like the clean, simplistic artwork.

What I am less enthusiastic about is the snowball effect. Usually the first person to get the upper hand is the winner. Still, I'm giving it a rather high rating, because I feel that there is more to explore within the game and that it is quite possible that what I don't really like disappears with becoming a more experienced player.

Overall: a really good, fast, simple and original game.

Finally got to play a full game of this one.

I love all the interactions between the cards - always a plus.  Lots a player interaction - also a plus.

The game ended with a wonky win condition being revealed late in the game - awarding the win on a seemingly random basis.  I'm not really sure what I think about that.

I would really want to play this again to get a better sense of the game.

Pretty solid game.  Everyone just loves getting to the highest tech levels and look at the crazy powerful cards.  I mean, if nothing else, you should play it just to get a chance to see what's in the '10' deck.

How is the actual game?  A little confusing at first honestly.  I mean, it plays smooth eventually, but you're just sorta playing along at first.

It takes a fair amount of deck familiarity to get some strategy goin'.

I don't quite like the stutter of "count and see who can follow" but it's not really that bad.

Overall, very successful.  We'll see if we can get more strategy in the game with more plays.

Mar11:

After ~10 more plays? I have more respect for it... maybe. I still think it pales in comparison to Race for the Galaxy. Too much chaos and too little planning. Still, as long as it's played swiftly, I enjoy it. If a player tries to min/max too much, they just kill the game. And counting the icons still blows.


We did try the 2v2 variant in the last game. This was infinitely better than the only other 4 player game I've tried. I would never play regular 4-player again.

For me, there really only seems to be two solid strategies though:

A. Run up the tech tree as fast as you can. So many of the 10s are just "I Win" that you generally just, well, win.

B. Get to factories-ish and ramp your score quickly. Make sure you steal some to slow the opponent down. Snag a bunch of achievements and win.

I realize those are sort of general, but you almost do need to pick one of those plans to go for I'd say. If you dally with castles, you will almost definitely lose.

I don't have a clue where I came up with the above comments.  This game can be a chaotic mess, but still be fun as long as you keep going at a swift speed.

Innovation is a deceptively deep game. Much like its cousin glory to rome, while there may not be much going on at face value, it is endlessly re-playable, and balances the right amount of tactics with luck. Every game is different. It is also an excellent, and probably my favourite, 2 player game  Plus the run time is just comfortable at around 40 minutes (for 2 players, longer for more).

Random civilization card game, in which you are trying to score cards in order to be the first to hit point milestones, get enough milestones and you win.

Not overly impressed, very arbitrary - might get better after a few plays but I'm not sure I want to see if that hypothesis is correct.

I found it annoying that you had to cover up your good cards (or the ones you at least had a strategy for) with the ones you pick up (or are forced to take) of the same colour, it made every round too chaotic.  Can't recommend this one.

I've enjoyed my plays from the beginning because I like the different directions that each game takes because of the general openness of the game, but the fact that you have only two actions and your actions require close tabs on other players insures that game moves along at an engaging pace.

Initially, the apparent openness of the game provides little direction in how to play a strategy, but with more play some general ideas of a strategy emerge, though the game is primarily tactical. I love how the game state can change dramatically, but not everyone will enjoy that quality.

Boring.  Incredibly random.  Reminds me of flux, but it hurts more since flux is shorter and you don't get the sense in flux of building towards a goal like Innovation fools you into.  Nor do you have to explain overly complex cards to idiots in flux like you do here. 

A couple novel things going for it gets it up to a 5.  The splaying stuff is great.  It needs to be used more.  The way scoring cards are done is creative.  

I'm nowhere near a fan of the cards that let somebody essentially take your entire melded cardset simply due to the fact they have 1 more industry than you do.  And then from then you, you'll NEVER have more industry then they do since they just get to re-steal it all every turn unless you or somebody else gets something to stop it.

RATING: 7
Tells a great story of technology advancement through history while keeping playtime to under 90 minutes (probably faster with practice). Quite tactical and more of a ride than a game when played with four players. Three players has been the sweet spot for me.

Update: Docking it just because it is so sensitive to player count in my opinion. I really only like it with three players, though it is a lot of fun at that count.

First time I played this game I rated it a 4. Now after 5 plays I rate it a 10. The first time it seems like an abstract game with no real strategy. After 5 plays you know what cards to go for and it becomes more fun.

initial rating

Hmmm, on the surface it looks like this game was overhyped (what a shock...not) and not unlike other [i]recent[/i] games of this Ilk, a bit of a pattern that...

Cool combos and all that but not sure how much depth is really there, its all tactics really as things change quite a bit and cards always come out randomly from face down piles.  Though cards are all different or unique, MOST do a lot of the same things, ie throw a card away and score a point, throw 2 cards away score 2 points, etc, etc.  Still, I’m a card game whore and this still seems like a fun one overall. Nuclear bomb, WOW is all I have to say about that. Is splaying even worth it? Must be I suppose if you get enough symbols, I do need to play more to suss things out better.   

At any rate, I’m not sure I care about the chaos yet and those that know me know I hate it, so far, I never really seen it really just very small doses so once I do, its probably going to suck no doubt but apparently some of the chaos can be overcome? lets us see about that.  Luck of the draw seems to be here in spades too but still, I want to play more to see if there is anymore more than meets the eye as some seem to let on to...(note it also has that annoying Le Havre effect where you need to look across the whole table to try and read what everyone else has and it's nearly impossible to do with all the small text on cards) I'm not all that inspired to keep playing so far and will definitely avoid 4 player games

UPDATE:  Played this again, only the 2nd time now and 3 years later (yeah wasn't too excited about this one, but I did pick it up to explore a little since so many people seem to like it) and I am of the same mind as my comments 3 years ago, overhyped. Looking at my comments I wonder if I was taught slightly wrong originally (splaying would always be worth it it seems now) but it doesn't change anything in the big picture. It's easy to see the appeal, but holy shit the chaos here even playing with 2 players. Lose your hand, lose all your top cards on board, player steals your cards and scores them, and on and on. So while there is some good things I don't see how they outweigh the bad here since you have very limited control. 

So bottom line I'd rather player Race for the Galaxy, GtR or a host of other card games when given the choice. I should also note the theme is pretty weak really and can be completely ignored when playing (I suppose you could "look for it" too and see it there, but its just not important to gameplay at all). But let's see, I'll give it at least one more shot since I now own it, it seems there is probably enough chaos that maybe it evens out, but between that and the luck of the draw I don't know how wins can be meaningful really. Yet some people say with enough play you can actually play more strategically, and surf this crazy chaos (while I could see this, I'm not sure I'll have the patience to get through that many plays and the card effects here are sometimes SO strong that I still think control has to be fairly limited) Rating likely to drop to 6 or even 5 if not enough control can be exerted. 

P.S. - once again I love Morgan's comments, this one is for a "shorter variant" capturing the essence of the gameplay here: (thanks for the laugh again Morgan!)

[q=sisteray]In a three player game, randomly deal out a 10 card, an 8 card and a 4 card. The person with the 4 card gets to trade for the 10 card and wins. The old 10 card guy comes in last even though he had the high number because ultimately he drew the wrong card and someone else drew the right one. [/q]

UPDATE: 7 => 6 Gave it another chance, opponent got Gunpowder which I eventually countered but it put it me behind, okay fine, but then they got Statistics. This card ended the game, its WAY too strong and if you can't counter it because LUCK did/does not give you the right card in the draw, you're totally fubared. "[i]I demand you transfer the highest card in your score pile to your hand![/i]" So there was no point for me to try and score, since opponent would just make me pick up the card, and without scoring you can not achieve thus can't win the game. I picked up about 15 cards looking for a counter, got none. (Though there are counters there somewhere, maybe I should toast Statistics from the deck completely...edit, yeah the more I think about it, the more almost broken that one card seems, its a game-ender without a counter)

It seems there are many of these types as I mentioned before, don't see how you can plan for them if that many, you don't know which ones you will get vs opponent, so its just pure chaos really. I can see why people like the game for the neat aspects like splaying and combos, but I don't get how the chaos and luck does not bother them. Ah well, likely give it one more chance, but my patience is the near the end for sure, chaos and lack of control is one of my most, if not the most detested features in a game.

A civilization-esque card game focusing on technologies and the constant tug of war to win influence points. As the game progresses, the tempo of the game increases and things gets more and more swingy. A player could gain influence as fast as they could love them. I would like to play it more to discover its other combos, but I think the chaotic nature of late game and the massive array of take that elements could push some players off from playing this game.

Good game once you get to grips with it.  It seems like there should be combos to work out, but with all unique cards it could be difficult to repeat.  Especially as each game 9 cards are out from the start, and then others go into influence.

Reminds me a lot of Race for the Galaxy in that it's a strategic game of building card combos but it comes down to luck whether you can find combos faster than your opponents. It also seems like there isn't enough to do with cards that you can't combo together and don't work with whatever it is you're doing. But the biggest problem is that whether or not your cards can even do what they say they do comes down to what symbols your opponents happen to end up with. That said the excitement of the race aspect, the potential for fun combos, and the fact that this is a quick game all make up for the randomness enough.

Don't want to rate this yet.  I really wanted to like it - the rulebook wasn't great, but once we got the ball rolling, I saw a LOT of potential.  But then we hit a card in Age 4 that seemed so powerful in a two-player game that it felt broken - "Anatomy" let me ruthlessly dismantle my opponent's entire economic engine over the course of 4 or 5 turns (and she had a sizeable lead at that point.)  10 minutes later, it was clear I was just going to coast to victory while she's never be able to get out of Age 2, so we shut it down.

I'd love to try it again, but I just can't buy it until I figure out whether there are serious balance issues, or if we were just missing something obvious.

RATING: 7
Possibly the heaviest non-war game mainly for two players that I've encountered, it has some clunky rules and a steep learning curve (oh, and the original edition has hideous art on top of all that). But there is a deep, interesting game here that rewards multiple plays. And that is enough for me to have a positive opinion of it.

RATING: 8
== Preliminary comments after 2 plays. It's an 8 for sure, with that value likely to rise.

My wife and I played twice on the night that Innovation arrived. It's a good game, but I'll bet that the 4-player game is crazy chaotic.

There's a lot going on, lots of small combos (and some bigger ones), and a lot of decisions. Tina crushed me in the first game, but the second one was much more back and forth, with the lead changing several times. Hand / score pile / tableau management is front-and-center, and most of your decisions revolve around managing one of the areas to maximize a particular effect.

We didn't make it into Age 8, so none of the insanity of the Age 9 / 10 cards came into play. Those ages are basically two stacks of bombs that give someone who is behind in achievements (the primary win condition) a chance to win on one of the secondary conditions.

I think that much like Glory To Rome there will be a point within the first dozen plays where things click and you start to play your opponent more. In GtR the first step in the learning curve is figuring out that you have to manage the pool to prevent your left-hand opponent from scooping up a disproportionately good set of clients.

In Innovation there are many times per game where you have to choose between advancing your own agenda and attacking others, between pushing the ages and dumping cards back into the supply to slow things down.

I'm looking forward to exploring this.

== Note regarding the concerns about Gunpowder / Engineering being overpowered.  I just don't see it. Sure, you could be dumb and load up on castles going into Age III and then watch your entire civilization get leveled. On the other hand, you could simply not be dumb. The castle cards are quite powerful and attractive early. Use some, but don't go overboard, unless you accept the risk involved in doing so.

Heavy luck element. Anyone can win. A good player will probably win more often than a bad player, but I don't think this is a game where one player will routinely beat another player.

If the game play is tense and cutthroat, then I think you're playing it right.

Edit: After half a dozen plays, rating increased from 8 to 9. This is the first time I've given a game a 9 rating, and I don't even like cutthroat games like this, but I do like card games very much. I expect the rating may go down a bit after I rack up a few dozen plays and start to get bored with it.

This seems to have quite easy mechanics to pick up and a lot of fun in exploring what you can do with the diverse card actions (with a minor flip side that games can slow as players read their cards). I've seen efficient strategies can beat players with large hands and tableaus; I've not seen slow-death games. Some criticise specific over-powered cards, but I've beaten cards that previously whipped me when I've met them again. Playing in teams with 4 players works well too. Also, the Iello edition's look and feel is great!

Received this for Christmas and managed to have our first (2 player) game tonight. We had a few false starts as we worked out the mechanics and forgot and remembered rules but had it all making sense by the end. A little frustrating as I felt there wasn't much that could be done to impede an opponents powerful combination of active cards. Looking forward to playing again though, especially with more players.

Wow! I picked this baby up at Origins, Stumbled across a guy who had just finished a game and was willing to teach us, learned it, and was instantly in love. I guess I would sum it up as "Fluxx with strategy". I love the feeling that while playing it, plans materialize, combos become apparent, and things constantly shift. The game ebbs and flows in a really cool way. I also like how it's possible for someone to come back from behind with a powerful combo and ride it to victory. All in all a great game, and I hope it holds up to more plays.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2012)

This game has been a roller-coaster for me. At first, as I really like Glory to Rome, I was expecting a lot from Innovation and I was disappointed in the game. I found the game to be mostly luck and chaos, however with each play I found more control hidden between the chaos and I’m liking it more and more. I still think the game has a lot of luck, but perhaps it has more to offer that I initially thought. I only have played with four players (free for all) so I believe as a 2 player game the chaos can go down considerably and it would open the door to skillful play. (I hope)

As with Glory to Rome, it appears the game has a steep learning curve. It has a ton of cards and each one has a different text and effect, so experience counts a lot in this game. I really like Civ theme games, however, when I play Innovation I don’t feel it (I’m only looking for icons, dogmas and colors) so the theme is mostly lost on me.

The game can take a lot of space for a card game. The components quality is ok and the art of the cards is also ok. The art serves well its purpose. (But the components are much nicer in the Spanish edition).

For now the jury is still out on this one and I want to play again soon to really appreciate the game.

The game seems very tactical with 4 and I think I'd prefer to play with 2 or 3 players in the future.  There are lots of neat interlocking powers, but it's easy to get distracted and forget about actually trying to win.

Comparisons to Fluxx are apt, when due care is taken to point out the massive differences as well.

I would prefer if more games got to the later phases, as the spiraling brokenness seems to be this game's major drawing card, nto unlike Glory to Rome.  Unfortunately rush strategies are seeming too successful at this point.

I love how the decision making in Innovation works. Deciding which cards to play out (i.e., meld in the game) and which to lose to card's abilities makes for interesting decisions within the game. On top of that, the game plays out quite differently from one game to the next and it comes in a pretty small box. Lots of great reasons to own and play Innovation.

Can't get enough of this.  Still learning card combinations.  It is always interesting which cards show up.  A lot of luck, but there are usually ways around a player who takes off early.  My theory is SPLAY, SPLAY, SPLAY.  My husband and I are a very even match in this game, which makes it even better.  Almost a daily re-match!

12-31-2011 Edit: My husband told me to put this game away for a while...too mean! Maybe this game loses its appeal after awhile. Wonder if the expansion helps or makes it worse.

Chaotic, churning fun, so if your idea of the perfect game is to quietly gather resources and build a little optimisation engine more efficiently than, and untroubled by, the other players then this is categorically not your type of game.

But if wild swings of fortune and the ability to pounce on the others (metaphorically, of course!) is up your street then there's a good chance this is too.

Seems simpler than the designer's earlier 'Glory to Rome' which I didn't expect.

The Iello production is stunning for what remains a relatively inexpensive card game. Gone are the clip art graphics of the original, and the physical quality of the box in particular is superb - it's closed by a magnet!

RATING: 6
One word pretty much summarizes my first play...chaotic. The ending came about rather suddenly although I facilitated this with the mis-use of canning.  The terms used to describe the actions seem a little over the top.  For instance instead of playing a card you "meld" it.  For me not a big deal but it makes the game less accessible as a whole.  My wife would probably not play it as things like this frustrate her. 

As a whole I look forward to playing this again.

Interesting, insomuch as the cards are used in multiple fashion, but beyond that doesn't really do much to hold my interest.

I'd had a teaser of this game a while ago and was eager to play it in full. However, I was very disappointed in the play of this game. While there is an element of skill involved, a lot of the card effects can swing the game in an unfair manner, adding a big feel bad factor. Being behind in this game is hard to overcome as any effect you use will happen after somebody else gets the use of it first (which in some instances renders your own use of it ineffective). Splaying is a necessary part of this game as if you aren't doing it, you're losing. But, splaying can only be done using the effect of some cards, which adds an element of 'luck of the draw' that in my opinion is too much of a game changer to leave to chance. Another of those games that is great if you don't have a strategic interest and just want to see how things play out.

Another game that must be played a lot in order to fully know the cards involved.  I'd never play this enough times.  It's OK as a 'once in a while' game, where everyone has played before, but not something I'd add to my collection.

A couple of notes:

The rules could stand a little more clarification, especially when it comes to taking multiple actions.  More examples in the rules would have helped.

The card fronts are legible and, for the most part, are functional.  However, the card backs use completely different fonts for each number and some are quite ugly... why was this done?  One standard font would have made the game look a lot more professional.

The artwork and play are a more sophisticated (therefore  less "fun") Glory to Rome. This game derives from rummy rather than trick-taking. Some features of two games are superficially similar: cards with multiple functions, "super-duper" card powers (here called "dogmas", and which get more powerful as the game progresses through seven different decks) and produce a playful chaos. You still tuck accumulated cards under different sides of a mat. 
The game has some innovative mechanics (my favorite of which is "splaying", i.e. spreading out melded card piles in one of three directions in order to tactically gain the technologies on them), but the jury is still out overall. How does one overcome the fatal flaw of being unable to read the print upsidedown on opponents' cards? You can't really memorize 140 powers; and, unfortunately, they "make or break" your game. GtR only has 40, and SJ even fewer, so you can actually plan to counter your opponent.  
On the other hand, this game feels like a refreshingly new traditional card game (my favorite genre), and I wonder if over time I'll find more of a sublime, mature pleasure here. The mechanism of stacking a bunch of a cards in a pile and then splaying them upon your opponents is delicious and forces you to think in whole new ways! It's one of those mechanisms that feels so natural you think should be a thousand years old.

This game is delicious. It's a breath of fresh air. The games are tense, back and forth. You think you're behind but suddenly not. The cards are thematic-- well, at least some of them. There is a wonderful arc to the game. It takes some brain burning, and some luck, but the "you're about to win, now I'm about to win, now you're about to win" feeling is simply terrific.

If you were lukewarm after one play- you owe it to yourself to play it a few more times. It's that good.

The more I play Innovation, the more I like it, and the less I understand it. Of course, that isn't actually true. I understand it, but it can get hard to track and confusing at times. 

It still has that Fluxx like behavior of looking like you'll win and then BOOM, sorry you lost cause I've got 38 light bulbs. That has never actually happened, but it almost did. 

I can't imagine ever getting rid of this game, it's just too good.

This is a first impression after a single 2 player game in which I completely ran away with it, getting 6 domination before my wife got even 1. I'm guessing my opinion of the game will go up, because I really think the game is probably better than it at first seems. From my perspective, though, it looked a lot like my wife got very few cards that allowed her to score cards for influence, so while she was spinning her wheels, I was racking up points and dominations. We both enjoyed the mechanisms and card effects, though, so we'll stick with it and hopefully discover the genius that lies beneath the chaos.

My first impression of this game wasn't great, but I'm so glad I gave it another shot. This is truly a remarkable game. The attention to detail in the design and the synergy of the cards is staggering. The amount of permutation and combinations is endless. While it lacks some of the heavier aspects of the true civ experience, this game delivers a serious dose of gaming through situational tactics, decision making, and the fun of advancing your plans and spoiling the plans of others. It teeters on the precipice of chaos the entire time, which is part of the appeal and intrigue.

I thoroughly enjoy this game and I'm happy to say it's a current household fav.  The random draw of 105 completely unique cards keeps this game fresh... everytime.  Card familiarity is necessary.  Rating is for mostly 2-player games.

RATING: 7.5
Innovations are broken into ten ages, with each card carrying symbols… and abilities which either aid or strike the opponents if they have more or less of those symbols (respectively). It's a lot of reading on the cards for some, the symbols take some getting used to -- but once you get the hang of it, you can see the way the game can play out.

PLUS: interactive, well designed
MINUS: learning curve for some players

I've had mixed feelings about combo card games like Race to the Galaxy and Glory to Rome. As in, I tend to like them in theory more than reality. However, Innovation is the first card game of this type that I can without reservation say that I enjoy. I more than enjoy it actually. I think Innovation tops the others for me because it is more streamlined. While it uses symbology, it does not leverage it to the degree of complexity that can be a barrier to teaching some of these other games. The actions are simple, the special actions clearly explained, and the power-ups logical and clear. I think this solves many of my issues with the earlier games in this genre. I can more quickly ramp up here to simply enjoy the game, and that I have done. The possibilities are rich with (mostly) tactical but also (some) strategic options. For two players, this is really excellent stuff. Not sure I'd be interested in playing it with more...

RATING: 4
Such a disappointment for me.  Glory to Rome is one of my all time favorites so I looked to this with great anticipation.  The comparisons and analogies to Fluxx are appropriate.  Its like you will be playing the game and then the whole thing gets struck by lightning and then you're looking around after the smoke clears to see what happened to the game state.  Far too chaotic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After game 1: Feels a bit too random and those insta-win cards are a bit capricious. Rating 3.

After game 2: Seriously? This game is totally random. Luck of the draw with incredibly powerful cards. Kinda reminds me of Flux. Rating 2.

After game 3: Hmm much better with 3 players than with 2. The cards still feel pretty random but I'm liking the dogmas and splaying more. Still don't feel the theme though. Rating 4.

After game 4: So I tried 2 players again and it wasn't as bad as the first time (though I'm not very aggressive either). I'm doing better with the lower era cards' randomness (under 8) although the theme is still very abstract. Rating 6. 

After game 5: This is easier to teach if you chuck the theme. Taught my wife who liked it better than dominion. Some of the dogmas made us laugh.  Rating 6.

After games 6-8: I'm the only one in my group who finds this game worth exploring. My wife thinks it's okay but would prefer to spend our rare game sessions elsewherse. Rating 6.

Final Thoughts: Easy to teach/learn, plays quickly, very interactive, and has little downtime. I also like how many of the "I demand" cards also give benefit to your opponents and how the "shared" dogmas work. However, its abstract nature and luck of the draw can be difficult at times to overcome, making it hard for several in my group to swallow.

An interesting card game. The end game is a little too luck-based though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating based on about 6-7 plays.  Doubt it will change much.  If you take the game seriously, it's like Race for the Galaxy, in that there's a steep learning curve and you really have to know all the cards (105 of them).  There's a tremendous amount of luck here, IMHO, in having the right cards at the right time.  While I really wanted to like this game, I think there's a fatal flaw which I call the "front runner problem," namely if a player chooses the "Achieve" action to claim a VP card, that player doesn't have to sacrifice anything from his/her scoring pile and is the front runner for obtaining the next VP card.  It's up to the game system and the other players to do something to bring the leader down, perhaps sacrificing their own positions, plus they might not have the right cards to do this.  The one game I actually won was a game I was out of it, had ZERO achievements and very few cards in my meager scorepile, and then another player who was behind but much closer to the leader than I was did a "Hail Mary," flipped a card that said the player with the most leafs (me) wins.  Wow, what a game!

RATING: 10
Unrated after two plays, a 7 after four, an 8 after five, a 9 after six, and a 10 after 30. Best with two players, great with three, and fun as a partnership game with four. 

Innovation is the follow-up to Glory to Rome, and as such it has some very big shoes to fill. There are ~100 unique cards spread over 10 periods of human history, from Prehistory to the Information Age. The complexity and range of the card-set is wonderful; the graphic design is not. Relevant text is tiny, making it unnecessarily difficult to keep track of your opponents' capabilities (a key aspect of the game). The impact of any given card hints at its thematic corollary, but the level abstraction is high or at least 'feels' quite high initially. With more play, those connections become clearer, but whether they become "clear enough" will be a problem for many players. The GtR fanbase is already split on this. 

The biggest potential flaw in the gameplay itself is the scoring. To win the game, players must claim "achievements" by accumulating points in their score pile. Often, the player who claims the first achievement is best positioned to claim the second - a classic breakaway leader problem. Essentially what it amounts to is that players don't have to pay anything to score, they just have to have the cash on hand. Fortunately, the opportunity cost to scoring seems sufficiently high for the competition to take a step back, reorganize, and then sprint ahead with much greater speed. That takes skill and familiarity, though, so early games may see one player claim the first 5 achievements in sequence, winning handily while the other players never get off the starting line. Such a result is profoundly unsatisfying. 

The other odd thing about Innovation is that players only get two actions in a round, and the basic versions of these actions are very weak. Players will need to think [i]very[/i] carefully about their options and find ways to leverage their cards that are 2-4 times as productive as a basic move. The disparity between basic moves and power plays makes it easy for players to feel utterly stalled from time to time. That's not very satisfying either, lending a "tightrope" quality to the initial, disorienting plays. 

I'm convinced there's a great game here, and honestly I'd have bet against it after my first two plays. It will take a [i]long[/i] time to become familiar with each "Innovation" in the deck, but if that's acceptable there's no reason not to explore and enjoy this incredible game.

I absolutely love this game!  After 5 plays with the wife (4 of which I lost), I moved my rating to a 9 and put it on my top 10 games list.  The mechanics and interactions are like nothing else you've ever played (the Glory to Rome comparison is very shallow).  

Played it twice with 4, though, and it's much different.  Seems very random.  Since I love the game so much, I'll definitely play it more, but will no longer introduce new players with a 4p game.  My feeling is that (like with Glory to Rome) as experience grows, randomness declines.  However, because EVERY card is unique and there are SO many interactions, the experience curve on the 4p game is very high...probably 50 games or more.  2p experience curve seems much more reasonable.

Very glad to get this after waiting 2 yrs for it to be available in the UK. By the same designer as Glory To Rome (my favourite game). It doesn't disappoint. First impressions after a couple of dozen plays is that it is very good but does require some experience with it before it really begins to shine (as did GTR). I shall be playing this a lot. 

Update - I have been playing this a lot. On balance I think GTR has the edge on it. If you are going to play this four player I recommend you use the partnership rules here on the geek.

Excellent Civ building game with mulitple strategies to win. Do you go early and attempt to eke out a win with only a few combo-riffic cards or shoot up the tech tree to try and pull out a win late with some ridiculously powerful late game scoring?

Sat down tonight and played this 6 times in a row 2 player - the games were split evenly and were mostly close (there were 2 blowouts - both preventable early game combos).

Excellent game that rewards playing.

Combo-building is a genre I have trouble with. My first play of Innovation was ok which is almost a recommendation for the game. There will be wild swings in the game but there's also a lot of potential for clever moves. Innovation is one of the games players can't win by their decisions alone as there's too much screwage but that can easily be lost by stalling your engine. To really enjoy the game, it's necessary to play repeatedly and get acquainted with the cards.

With two expansions the game is almost a lifestyle- a wild ride of skill and randomness, each play still surprising, each play spinning in weird directions.

Acquired 2013. Finally pulled it out after a long hiatus. Really enjoying it! I can tell I have matured as a gamer as I slogged through it my first two plays(years ago) and could never really get in to it. Now after 2 plays a couple years later it has just clicked. I like how the momentum can so quickly shift as to who is in the lead. It makes for exciting gameplay, knowing that at any minute the tables could turn and trying to anticipate that and be one up on the other players. I always only play this 2 player and don't know if I would introduce any more players to the mix. I think it would end up too chaotic. Highly recommend for more seasoned gamers, but not for newbies!

While I haven't been as enamored with Innovation as many have been here at BGG, it is an interesting design that seems to offer a lot of different choices.

But the game doesn't overstay its welcome and definitely seems to require enough skill to reward more experienced players.

This, to me, screams unfulfilled potential. The cards doing so many things, without icons, with such wall of texts and having to keep track of so many? That is ridiculous. 

The concept of the game is incredible, and could easily be a 9. But the lack of icon, or quickly read power descriptions, kill this. Furthermore, I've played many games that would just never stop, because so many good "attack cards" were on the table, and no cards gave influence. Eventually, somebody got tired of it and made someone else win with a dogma.

Unfulfilled potential. So much of it.

I can see how this could be decent or even fun if you had only one opponent. I'm sure it's good for two. But you know how sometimes, when you're a teenager, you fill up too much on one kind of liquor one night, and for the rest of your life, no matter how good it might be, the smell of tequila makes you a little bit nauseous? 

See, I'm having the same problem here as I had with Erosion (a not-that-dissimilar game). The box says you can play with 2-4 people, but playing it with four is a hideous mistake. Do I say what I really think about it after that one play, since I'll never play it again? I think it's fair game - if you don't want your product reviewed after a play with four, then don't market it as a game that'll accommodate four.

You might be able to tell where I'm going with this.

First of all, the AP is rife. In theory, you should know what everyone's cards are at all times. In theory, you should be keeping track of what's in the discard pile. In theory, you should be able to make it more difficult for your opponents to screw you with Dogma cards. And in theory, everyone should get a reasonable shot at splaying, score cards, and so on.

In practice, with four anyway, none of these things are really possible, though you might be able to manage the first two if you don't mind waiting half an hour between turns.

With four, there are so many chances for people to mess with your cards that you can't plan anything from turn to turn. I didn't get any splay or tuck or score cards for the first six turns of the game, so I ended up way behind with no way to catch up except by using my leaf dogma to grab the occasional 2- and 3-value card. This is the classic problem for games like this - once you fall far enough behind, what do you do? Throw the game? Just draw cards and wait for whoever's ahead to deliver a headshot? That's probably more interesting than trying to spend twenty minutes calibrating futile moves. 

It gets points for being pretty to look at, but- seriously? There was no way to pattern the cards so that I can easily see at a glance what their basic function is, like whether they're used to Demand or to Meld or whatever? 

There are 140 cards, every single one with a different power, so you'd have to play at least ten or twenty games to get to know what's out there and how it works with everything else. If this sort of game is what puts lead in your pencil, then go for it. I won't.

As a 2-player game, this is a complex, fascinating, and ever-different game.  We love it!!!

The cards and the other player's powers can ruin your plan, but you must -- and yes, you can -- come up with a new plan.  Every turn is a complex new puzzle, but you must also think about your medium-term plans.  A slightly-better player will win 8 out of 9 times, so do not fear the chaos.

I only tried 3 players once; it seemed more chaotic but promising.  With 4 players I would want to play as 2 teams.

Okay firstly:  VERY COOL and indeed, innovative overall gameplay.  The "splaying", the 10 ages laid out in a circle, the scoring and achieving - all good stuff.

But holy shit!  A card-drawing game where every single card does something totally different, and there are almost 100 of the things?  Not only that but some cards have HUGE powers, like "swap out 3 of your cards for 3 of someone else's" type shit.  Huge paragraphs of instructions on some of these cards.

This means that it is utterly and completely impossible to create any strategy of more of a long-term than "what can I do on this current turn".  I find that stupid.  No thanks!

This one is a tiny dynamo of a game, and one that I like best with two players. The elegant way the game incorporates aspects of civilization building (things lapsing into obsolescence, new technologies supplanting old) in a little card game is nothing short of brilliant. The only complaint I might have with it is the pacing. What starts off as a nice, gradual game of building and splaying your stacks of cards eventually becomes a wild mad dash for the final achievements. The endgame can be quite intense, so be prepared!

Great game. Good pace, kind of scary. You can't get attached to your cards you just have to sit back and enjoy the ride. I'm going to have to let the wife win if I ever want to play it again with her though I think.

Has the potential to become a very frequently played card game much like Race for the Galaxy and Dominion, I need to purchase a copy of this!

After 10 or so plays: Great game! With the amount of very different powers on the cards, each game tend to be very different from each another. It just have enough strategy to keep me interested to play more and more. In other words, I think we have a winner here!

After 50 or so plays: Upgraded the rating to 10. Yes, it's that good.

Trading to make room for Innovation Deluxe. Includes Echoes of the Past expansion. This one really scratches an itch for me due to the complex and open-ended interactions between the cards, the different ways each card can be played, and the theme (it's always fun to figure out what the historical equivalent to each player's civilization might be based on the cards they've played). I don't know if it's a perfect game, but it's got a lot of strategy along with a lot of chaos, so it's perfect for me.

Great game with some similarities to Glory to Rome. Very high level of interaction with some very powerful combinations possible. Seems to be an extremely tactical game, as you need to react to what is going on and do the best with what you have available with a few strategic decisions mixed in. Played with 2 & 3 so far with 3 being my preference. As with many games of this type, some may be blow outs that end quickly while others can come right down to the end and last for some time. 105 different cards will inevitably lead to better play by experienced players, but the game is so unpredictable, a win by a newbie is certainly possible. If the game goes into ages 9 or 10, be prepared for some serious craziness. Although I do not know if this was the plan, seems that future expansions could certainly be possible.

With Glory to Rome, crazy was the new norm.  Innovation is Glory to Rome crazy x2 with more polish and a tighter theme.

I love the numerous complex and hidden math mechanics.  The 'splaying' mechanic is genius!

Adopting the video game practice of selling the beta for wide play testing with the promise of a 1.0 update for the early adopters is a model that small boardgame publishers should utilize. Genius!

My only beef is that the game is to short for such juiciness!

[Edit]  I fission-ed the game today.  As you might expect, it was twice as long.  Now I want the game to have more cards, but especially more cards in the early eras while maintaining the ability to jump to a new era with a dogma effect. Result: more re-playability/combination/mystery with the early cards.

Best of the Chudyk games I've played (others being Impulse and Glory to Rome).

I'd consider this strictly a three player game, can't see what adding a fourth would accomplish except add to downtime (which already is the games biggest problem, like it is in all Chudyk games).

RATING: 4
Played it 4 times.  OK the artwork is gorgeous and the box closes by magnetism, all great. So it's nice to have just to look at.

The first time with 2 experienced opponents. Loved it, repeat game. Different cards but same feeling. Bought it. GF did not like it (too aggressive and too complicated texts). Played with gaming group. 2 did not like it (too random), 1 did like it. So it will never be played.

-5 nobody likes it
-1 explaining and setting up takes a lot of time, it is high learning curve. And you cannot play untli epoch 5, say, that just does not work.
-1 mechanics too contrived, and castles too powerful'; the influence and domination mechanic is, ehm, innovative, but takes time to really master.
-1 the card-taking-away ability is too powerful, once you get behind there is no way to recuperate. Blocking cards instead would have been better, there is no balance.

I just wish there was a solo variant for it.

Interesting card game which have some unique feel, but what bothers me here, is that this is full of different kind of special cards and actions AND there is a lot of chaos and luck included. Yes, you'll get familiar with all that, but first you've to play it enough. In a same time I'm VERY sure, that I'm not ready to use that time to learn the game, because there are so many more interesting games available.

RATING: N/A
This game by Carl Chudyk is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times. Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!

RATING: 6
[2010.Dec.03] Another "civilization lite" tech development game. This card-based affair has a relatively high complexity due to the numerous, unique cards that need to be "known" in order to be able to play the game with any proficiency. Additionally, overall game balance is at the mercy of the luck of the draw, because some cards' effects obviously outshine the effects of others. This is more of an experience game, than an actual game.

Chaotic tactics game. Incredibly elegant design achieving an astounding depth of play using only the simplest deck of cards and zero other components. Very thematic. Suffers from board-complexity as it is impossible to keep track of everyone's tableau. 

I put this in the same category as Cosmic Encounter - a fun, medium-weight game with little setup that is more about fun than pure strategic play. Requires the right mindset to enjoy. Don't get too attached to your hand, tableau, or strategy!

RATING: 3
Played three times, 3p, 4p.  Not nearly fast enough to be light, way too random to be heavy.  This game occupies a very overcrowded niche, with several better games.  To play this game fast, you'll need to play several times in succession, to cement the mechanics and the different card interactions; until then, games will take longer than you'd like.  Since you have very little control over the cards you draw and/or can use (though you do have some control), randomness haters will hate the game.  Better games in this category include Glory to Rome and 7 Wonders.  Gets a pip up for the innovative (heh) use of the icon as the resource.  I have read that it plays better as a 2p game (I believe it).  I have also read that it needs several games to reduce the randomness - this may be true, but I don't care.  The game isn't fun enough the first dozen times to justify the 13th, when there are hundreds, if not thousands, of games that ARE fun those first dozen times.

RATING: 3
This review is based on reading the rules and starting a solo game for testing, playing a few turns and stopping before my head exploded.

This game is a real brain burner. But if you like games like race for the galaxy, you should be able to handle it.

The good points of these games is that there are some interesting mechanics, like the icon and the sliding of cards. Second, the fact that the card special ability have REAL text is essential.

The first problem is that the rules are not clearly written because most of the rules are on the cards. For example, they tell you where is your score pile, and what you can buy with your score, but you do not know how to place cards in your score pile. So when you start the game, you have many holes in your head.

The main problem is that it is very complex. Each card has a special ability, you can use 1 or 2 of them on your turn. The problems is that all abilities consist in moving and drawing cards on the board. So you cannot guess with a single glance what the card does. 

That first create the problem that analyzing the cards you have and determining which are the best cards to keep, which is going to be placed into play and which you are going to use this turn is overwhelming. 

The seconds problem is that you lose track of the theme, if you had an ability like "Metal working: increase your military strength", you actually know and can visualize that your army is getting stronger. But in the game, you will move cards around without really having an idea of what has happened. You could use a card bad for you and not know it. 

But that is not enough, it gets even more complex because all card abilities can/must be used by other players when use them according. So if they have more or less icons of a certain type than you into play, they have to play the same action as you before you. That becomes very complex, because you need to analyze the icons of the other player too and see the impact on their game play. This is where the head simply explodes.

Finally, the box is so big. Common, it's a deck of card with some chart. It would have fit in a box with 1/3 of the thickness and you would have had space for and expansion deck.

I understand that in these kind of card games, you need to have a very flexible game to make sure you can have many unique cards, but it's just too much.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice little civilization-themed abstract card game where you are building cards and taking advantages of special power cards with majorities/minorities in particular icons/technologies.  There is a lot of opportunistic randomness and unforeseeable screw-your-neighbor events involved.  (I strongly prefer Seven Wonders for civ theme card games.)  This seems optimal with three players.  There are lots of text and flowcharting involved so I probably wouldn't want to play with players that need to know everything (perfect info) as there would be too much downtime and overanalyzing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm enjoying this more and more each time I play even though one of my friends called it complex Fluxx which isn't exactly high praise...;-)  It is interesting how actions chain together and the actions of the different cards vary widely.  Once you start getting to 9 & 10 level inventions though, ways to win or lose get crazy and unpredictable!  There seems to be a semblance of controlled chaos in the game - how much control actually exists I'm still unable to say.  Still, I cannot quite get this game out of my brain, and I remain very curious about the different routes to victory that exist.    Surprisingly, I even found it to be solid with 2 even though I initially thought I would not.

This is a really interesting card game. Some of the card interactions can be overpowered. Specifically the Canning card, which in both games I have played created a run away leader problem. Honestly, this game boils down to kind of randomness that any player can have much control over during play. And while you can wish you had a certain combination of cards, you have to be able to get them before you actually can use the combination.

RATING: 6
I have mixed feelings about this game. It can be fun and you can do interesting things with it, but you can also wind up with cards that don't work at all well together and just get stuck behind everyone else for an entire game. That said I've even seen players way behind get some crazy combo late game and turn things around, but it takes a lot of luck in what you draw.

RATING: 7
The cards are very icon/text filled and highly interactive. I get the sense that the game is very rich and offers mulitple paths to victory that one can uncover with further play.  The game seems to have a steep learning curve as people struggle to learn the extent of each of the card powers.

An unsupecting good little game on the development of human society.  Some very good card gaming design with intricate interactions.  I have yet to explore its full potential. 

Innovation is basically a mix and match card play in the very nature of the system. However, the mechanics make sense to what a player accomplishes in terms of the game objectives - the development of civilization to achieve 5 wonders. The cards are divided into 5 types and they are randomly dealt to you. Using what you have in hand, you try to maximize the developments on all fronts - from agriculture to monarchy, industrialization to economy. It is a clever design and offers some hours of enjoyment in deep strategy thinking. Overall, I like to play this game again and so far it is satisfying a game experience.

RATING: 9
(Some of the comments below come from impressions from the few games with beginners that I saw at Visite de Iello à Paris. Others come from actually playing the game.)

* Negative points:

- Players take a lot of time deciphering the card effects.  This makes the game more adapted to people who often play together.  Keeping all the various effects in mind is challenging: those of the cards in your Zone, those of the cards in Hand, and those of the cards in your opponents' Zones.  Magic is a little easier, because effects are more thematic.  However, after a couple of games, the situation is really not bad.

- It can be near impossible to stop certain cards: your influence does not grow fast enough (or even not at all), lags behind, you lag behind in ages, and your opponent has a very powerful card that you can do nothing about. (Note added later: I now think that in these conditions drawing and trying to move up quickly in the ages is a decent way out, as stronger powers come with later ages.) This is very different from a game like Race for the Galaxy, where one can still make victory points, implement a strategy, create new ones that bring more victory points, etc. In Magic, many cards can still usefully block the opponent's attacks: there is still hope, a fight, the possibility of defending oneself. Even in Glory to Rome, even when behind, one can still build buildings, amass material in one's vault, etc. Innovation can be a bit frustrating, not as much because victory seems inaccessible, but because it feels like almost nothing can be done about it, and there is sometimes almost no way of making any kind of progress (no card that gives influence, can stop the opponent, etc.). That said, maybe one finds himself in such uncomfortable situations only after making some strategic mistakes; such mistakes can be quite subtle, though, and I am still discovering them after more than 20 plays. In any case, this kind of situations is one of the very few blemishes of this game (Race for the Galaxy, Agricola do not have this kind of problem; maybe Space Hulk does, where a bad strategy can be hard to fix).

* Neutral points:

$ Some effects are not obviously thematic (Optics…).  However, most effects can be interpreted in some thematic way.

* Positive points:

+ The 2 player game is tense.  There are no extreme point swing (age 8-10 changes in the winning conditions are rare).

+ The race for Influence participates seriously to the tension. This is particularly tangible when some cards provide quasi "automatic scoring" (Medicine…).

+ The effects and the themes are varied. It is nice to "travel" this way (compared to more "uniform" games like some traditional card games, etc.).

+ The fact that there are only 5 card effects active in the Zone at a time helps devising tactics. However, there is still a lot to consider, because cards in the hand also have powers, and there is no hand limit (this may be mitigated by the fact that cards from the later periods are probably more powerful and can therefore be read in priority).  The game is satisfying.

+ The effects can often be interpreted in some way. Chemistry helps blue cards by splaying them: chemistry open possibilities in the technical domain, etc.

+ The rules are quite simple and streamlined. The FAQ helps smooth small details about the interpretation of the rules.

+ The player mats in the Iello edition are really convenient for new players, and as a refresher.

+ Easy to set up (provided that the Ages were sorted beforehand).

+ The mechanics of the dogmas are streamlined: weaker players suffer from dominations; players who are at least as strong also benefit from bonuses; the player with the dogma has a small advantage, since it emanates from his civilization. Easy to remember, and thematic.

+ It must feel nice to use a powerful effect, through a special combo.

+ New problems to be solved arise often: the game has variety.

+ Brain taxing: one has to constantly adjust to a shifting situation, and remember the effects of the cards that remain, but rethink them in the context of the new tableau cards, of the evolving influence and hand cards. More brain taxing than Race for the Galaxy, in this respect.

+ The number of answers to a problem, or of new strategic routes is often quite high: this allows player to display some satisfying creativity.

+ There is real tension, as interaction is quite high: other players can attack, and it is not always possible to answer immediately.

+ Turns are fast, or often have little downtime, with only 2, often simple actions, or supremacy/cooperative dogmas where other players often participate.

+ Some effects have a "dice" effect: some cards can stop being the Active one when a random card is put in play; this creates some nice Schadenfreude/yippee effects.

+ The game is not really chaotic, with 2 players, contrary to what I was led to believe initially from reviews.  In fact, my first two games had a clear strategic orientation for both players (fast influence lead vs fast age advancement).  Some effects are quite strong and game changing (Fission…), but the effects are on average less strong than in Magic: the Gathering, and they provide for some enjoyable drama.

Nota 1:
Arrastrar los mazos es quizá el factor más determinante del juego. Unos mazos arrastrados otorgan gran cantidad de recursos que permiten por un lado neutralizar los dogmas de supremacía del rival y por otro potenciar tanto los de supremacía propios como los de cooperación tanto propios como ajenos.

Nota 2: 
No hay carta mala; una situación favorable puede hacer que una carta inofensiva en otras circunstancias resulte letal. Como no hay límite a la cantidad de cartas que un jugador puede tener en la mano, es recomendable guardarlas ahí a la espera del momento más idóneo para su uso. 

Nota 3: 
Un equilibrio entre lo comentado en las 2 notas anteriores es la clave para la victoria en este juego.


MUY IMPORTANTE:

UN DOGMA DE COOPERACIÓN BENEFICIA A CUALQUIER JUGADOR RIVAL QUE AL HACER USO DE DICHO DOGMA MODIFICA EN ALGO LA SITUACIÓN DE LA PARTIDA: robar/descartarse, archivar/reciclar alguna carta...
SI NO ES EL CASO Y NINGÚN RIVAL REALIZA NINGUNA ACCIÓN QUE MODIFIQUE EL CURSO DE LA PARTIDA, SE CONSIDERA QUE DICHO DOGMA NO HA BENEFICIADO A NADIE Y POR TANTO EL JUGADOR QUE JUGÓ DICHO DOGMA NO RECIBE SU ACCIÓN EXTRA DE ROBAR UNA CARTA DEL MAZO DE ERA QUE CORRESPONDA.

DIFERENCIA ENTRE A QUIÉN AFECTA Y A QUIÉN BENEFICIA UN DOGMA COOPERATIVO:

UN DOGMA COOPERATIVO AFECTA A TODOS LOS JUGADORES CON UN Nº IGUAL O SUPERIOR DE LOS RECURSOS QUE INDICA EL DOGMA DEL JUGADOR QUE LO HA JUGADO. POR TANTO, TAMBIÉN AFECTA AL JUGADOR QUE JUEGA DICHO DOGMA.
EN CAMBIO, UN DOGMA COOPERATIVO SÓLO BENEFICIA A LOS JUGADORES RIVALES DEL JUGADOR QUE LO JUEGA Y QUE AL HACER USO DE DICHO DOGMA MODIFICAN EN ALGO LA SITUACIÓN DE LA PARTIDA.

An entertaining card game that I've barely scratched the surface of.

This is a game that if you play it a lot, you'll really learn the subtle nuances and depth there is here. If you're a casual player, like me, then it's entertaining enough, but you quickly forget the synergies between plays so it doesn't get as much love and attention as it might otherwise.

Having recently purchased Echoes of the Past, Steve and I have reinvigorated our Innovation play. For me, this game is way more about the journey than the destination, because I'm still not sure how possible it is to control who wins Innovation. You're making choices, and you can absolutely make the wrong choices, but every victory and defeat still feels a little mystical.

The theme looked interesting and we were eager to try to develop our civilizations with new and cool technologies.

However, we didn't really enjoy it.  The game felt chaotic and random, but also slow to start.  The beginning felt slow as we kept drawing cards and trying to meld them to get something useful started.  Conversely, technologies felt very fleeting as you played cards on top of them and covered them up.  At the same time, it felt like a lot of work to keep track of the number of icons we had (after every action, we had to keep counting to see if anything had changed and the other player got to use the action or not).  This became especially cumbersome once we had played quite a few cards.  Moreover, once one of us got a lead in one of the icons, it felt almost like a runaway since that player could active those actions over and over again while the other player could only try to draw cards to find something to counteract it.

I think partly what disappointed us is that we were expecting more of a resource engine game, whereas [thing=63888][/thing] is much more tactical and situational.  It was too random for us.  I think we prefer games where we build up an engine.  [thing=19857][/thing] had this feeling (and even more so [thing=28143][/thing], one of our favorite games in this genre), but [thing=63888][/thing] was not for us.  My wife in particularly reacted strongly and swore never to play it again.

Played it once, bleedin' confusing experience. To be fair, the core concepts weren't really explained to me, so small wonder.

Winning seems to be highly dependent on knowing what combos are the best, and counters what other combos - this makes it more a memory game than thinking game, which really isn't my thing

Finally managed to play my first Innovation game with my partner. I was pretty much swamped by the amount of powers or dogma but it was still great trying to figure out a good combination of cards. You definitely need to change your strategy on the fly depending on the cards you draw. So your opponents might have the upper hand now, but this game changes frequently therefore upperhands are short lived. 

Edit: That's it. Gets a 10 from me now. After so many plays, the game is still fresh. Every different player I introduce this game to plays differently, and again this keeps it fresh constantly. And even after this many plays, I've still yet to see fissure work!

Edit: 33 games and finally experienced my first successful fissure and the first time someone won with an age 11/12 card drawn with highest score. :)

RATING: 6
Alas, this is a game that hits or miss, and it doesn't only depend on the player, but on the game.

The game is VERY original, and for this gets one more point by me, the cards' mechanic is great.
However, it suffers the most (of all games I played) from unbalance. Few games you'll play with this game will be enjoyable for all, since luck is a factor, and one player will cruise ahead while others are stuck behind, to play for the rest of the game without really much hope to catch up.

When however the game makes everyone on the same level, it is a very enjoyable game. It just doesn't happen too often at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
If someone can stall to the 10th age, the cards are so powerful that basically who can start drawing a couple of them first wins or hard resets the game. This game also seems to drag, and even the cards in the lower ages seem imbalanced. EDIT didn't realize many think this games works best with 2-3, will need to retry this game.

EDIT again: I can kind of see some cool combos that would require a fair deal of strategy if I played this enough, but after my 5 plays of this game I still think it is a chaotic mess until you get to that point. The thing is this game gives you no sense of direction at all, and if you don't know what you are doing you can have basically your entire tableau stolen or blown up under you. I've played some games that I've rated higher with a similar problem (Famiglia, R-Eco), so I guess my not "getting" this game definitely affects its rating. However I think this game requires a lot more metagaming than those two games, and unlike something like Seasons where I just need to warn about a couple cards and the rest a person could play mostly optimally afterwards in this game there are a ton of cards that as I said before can just totally destroy your tableau. Bland artwork and graphical design certainly don't help this game. The level of frustration just isn't worth what may or may not be a potential payout: if I want to play a quick but deep tableau building, parasitic card game with a steep learning curve I'll just stick with Race.

PRE-RELEASE COPY

Since all 105 cards are unique and totally random draws, not to mention some of the effects can cause a bit of chaos; this game is not for the feint of heart.

That being said there is a TON of strategy in the game. Experienced players know when to change cards, activate dogmas, and more. 

It's really a fun experience. The only downside is that it does take some experience to get the play time down from 15 minutes a player, but that's hardly a bad thing.

I'm thinking my rating will rise.

Update:

Rating rose to a 9. There is far more control here if you invest time in learning the cards. It's just like playing Race or Dominion; card knowledge is key.

Can be an enjoyable game....but this is one where you need to "enjoy the ride" as opposed to expecting to be able to get to the destination in an orderly...planned manner.

Things that I like....
+ the amount of variety of combos or actions

Things that I don't like....
- needing to constantly read card's abilities since    each card can do something different things
- needing to constantly add up the "icons" for yourself and opponent

RATING: 9
A brilliant civilization-themed tableau-building game.  Excruciating decisions, fast turns, little if any down time.  Such new and novel gameplay mechanics are introduced like "splay", "foreshadow", "tuck", "echo"--I have never before seen these in any card game.  I love the fluidity, the choices, and possible chaotic finishes.  This game seems infinitely replayable, especially with "Echoes of the Past" and "Figures in the Sand".  Warning:  can have significant direct conflict!

A side note:  I guess whether one classifies "evolution" as an innovation boils down to whether he or she considers it a man-made theory or a [discovered] natural process. 

Best with two or [i]perhaps[/i] three players.  Not recommended with 4.  There is too much information on the table as tableaus grow, and it can be difficult enough to keep track of your own player area.  TTFN.  -->  G4GG prize.

A game that divides games in that the rules can change after each players turn.  But there are combinations and as you learn the cards, you can mitigate some of the luck.  Many people will argue this is only good with two players but I will play at any player count and have fun.  You do have to revel in the chaos.  I like most of Carl Chudyk's designs and this is brilliant.  I do think the expansions should be necessary as there are some minor balance issues without it.

Wow, gladly played four games in a row at the first sitting.  I haven't done that since RftG.  Sure, there is a lot of randomness, but at least it feels like you have meaningful choices to improve your chances.  The drama of precipitous swings of fate are always worth the price of admission.

Nice quick pace.  

Much more interaction than RftG or GtR.

Our go-to game for a shorter game and for taking to the cafe. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because the ending is almost always anti-climactic. Sometimes I will continue playing when I could take the win because it is more fun that way; winning is often too abrupt and disappointing. The more you play and learn the cards, the more scope for strategy rather than tactics; but angling for the special achievement cards also allows for longer-term planning. Can be nasty if you like to play that way, but you can also choose minimal interference with the other players (like any good Euro, I suppose). Really brilliant game, great two-player. I've only played once with three players but it seemed a little too chaotic for my taste with more than two.

Some comparisons to Glory of Rome.
Created by same game designer.
Nicer design (more aesthetically pleasing).

Plays in 30 minutes. Very respectable rating for a game that's been around for less than a year. 

Very chaotic with a lot going on creates a high barrier to entry (esp with non-gamers). While the game looks like it'll grow on you with familiarity, it seems like it'll require too many plays before it becomes enjoyable by all.

[Played 10 times]
Players lack control (the situation is very volatile), so no strategy can be planned: it is all tactic and luck of the draw (at times the outcome feels independent from your choices).
All cards have the same cost (one action), so they'd need to be WAY better balanced than they are (they vary wildly in usefulness) to lessen a bit the huge impact of luck.
It is better with 2, since this minimizes the chaos and downtime (there is always a LOT of chaos and more players exacerbate it)
It is definitely longer than advertised (different texts, multiple icons, volatile situations, need to count and recount icons, etc.).

The wide variety of cards and abilities provides endless replayability. And the way it mirrors real world innovations is educational.

Another entry in the illustrious list of games that manage to pack an astounding amount of game into a pack of cards. It is hard to point out what makes playing Innovation feel so unique and, well, innovative, but I’ll give it a try: you play out technology cards in five different colours, starting out with tech level 1. Your aim is to gain higher tech cards, both because of their improved abilities and of their point value, which can be used to gain achievements, a.k.a victory points (six achievements and you’re king of the hill). In a lovely twist, these achievements come from a common pool and have steeply increasing prices, right away giving you two strategic options in either buying early and cheap or focusing on your tech tree and scoring lage and big. 

Improving your technologies is a balancing act, because only the highest card of each of the five tech colours can be used for its effect - the others will possibly contribute power symbols that determine whether you can attack other players or benefit from their actions. The way in which these symbols are handled is very original, leads to a lot of interaction and breathtakingly dynamic gameplay and is bound to confuse the hell out of you during the first game. If you thought that Race for the Galaxy was too demanding, stay away, and regardless of that, listen well to the author’s recommendation of starting out with two players only.

Innovation is the most intriguing new game I’ve played in a couple of months, and one of the (regrettably) only two games I’ve played so far was a real nail-biter to boot, with both players at five achievements in the last round.

RATING: 8
(Thoughts in 2013 - 5 plays - rating 6.5):Take that, chaotic, and plays longer than it should.  I'll give it a few more tries to see if it improves once I can recognize card synergies.  Right now, I will not play this more than once a game session.  Too frustrating.

Update in January 2018: Got rid of Innovation not long after I originally rated it due to all the reasons above.  It showed up on boardgamearena so I decided to try it out again.  Way more enjoyable now.  Game is still a bit chaotic, involves quite a bit of take that, but it is much better once you start to try to manage your symbols and get a better feel for the cards in the deck.  Now I can see how tactical it is.  Offers plenty of opportunities for you to stop and think about how you can get the upperhand on your opponent.  I can see myself playing this 100+ times and not getting bored of the base game.  Will likely avoid the expansions.

Interesting cardgame with multiple ways to play cards but I do dislike it being a bit too carddriven. A game like this only excels if both players know the game and equally well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
UPDATE: Downgrading from an 8 to 5.  While the mechanics are sound, sometimes you cannot get an engine going because of lousy card draws.  With lack of card mitigation, it can make the game very frustrating. 

Plays in under an hour and very easy to teach.  The only challenging part of the game is wrapping your head around the different dogmas effects.  The wording can be very tricky so if you are playing with people who are not used to crazy card effects like Magic the Gathering, expect plenty of questions heading your way about what the cards do.

Once you've got that nailed down, it's a decent game.  I wouldn't recommend it with four players since there is way too much information to keep track of.  Three player works okay, but the apex is at the two player count.

Jeu très sympa. Le côté combo de carte n'est pas forcément évident à voir lors des premières parties, et finir en moins d'une heure ne se fait qu'avec un peu d'expérience.

Love it.  The game state changes so much that each turn you have a new situation to analyze for tactical possibilities, but you don't have so many options that it takes forever to decide what to do.  Biggest complaint is that after playing it a bunch most of my other games seem pale in comparison.

Like GLORY TO ROME, its all about building a tableau that breaks the base game rules as much as possible. Have not played a ton with the expansions, but the base game by itself has a ton of game play as each card is unique, and you never know which one per deck is being held out as the scoring card.

I know it is a good game for some, just not for me.  Pretty average, I have other games I would play instead of it (like Race).  Rating likely to go down as I really would never choose to play it.  And it has gone down, I have no interest in ever playing this again.  None.

This has just about become my favorite game. It can be highly chaotic, but the more it's played the more you can learn to mitigate the chaos. Some dismiss this game for being purely random, but this is not the case. There are a myriad different options on your turn, so the key to becoming a skilled player, is understanding all the card synergies to optimize those 2 actions you get each turn.

It's clever; only played once but there are so many directions you can go that you tend to look at the best thing you can do at the moment rather than a long-tern strategy.  Very non-linear.  It's clear there is a lot of depth here but it would take a long time to feel like you were doing anything other than saying "oh that's a cool power, I'll do that".  Not really my cup of tea for the same reasons I wasn't grabbed by Pax Porfiriana.

Building a civilization around the discovery of key inventions, with an aim to dominate particular eras of history.

20/8/12 (7 plays) 

Awesome game - hasn't disappointed me yet.  Every play is more and more enjoyable and I discover different nuances to the cards.  

2 player games are fast, with a strong momentum factor.  4 player games are slower and more complex. 

Love it, glad I own it and doubt this will change any time soon.  Plus it's a quick fire and uncomplicated civilization game without many bits and pieces.  Plus it is super portable.  Definitely one of the best value games I own.

The art on the 2nd (Iello) edition is gorgeous and it is incredibly well presented.  My only (minor) gripe is that the reds and blues can be hard to distinguish for those who happen to be colour blind.

17/11/12:  Downgraded to a 9.5 from a 10 after 16 plays.  Even in a two player game, there is a bit of luck which can make or break a game.

1/1/13: Downgraded to a 9 due to randomness.  Still great, but some games can involve lucky runs that can't be countered by any amount of good play.  Not that the rise and fall of civilizations was ever meant to be fair.

Nagyon érdekes játék! Elég nehézkes a nyelvezete, ezért a jó angol elengedhetetlen hozzá, ezen felül a kártyák különböző tulajdonságai miatt kell 1-2 gyakorló játék, amire belejön az ember és ráérez az ízére. Ha túlesünk ezen, akkor viszont egy fantasztikus játékélménnyel lehetünk gazdagabbak: mind a 105 játékkártya más tulajdonsággal bír, nincs két egyforma játék, és bár bizonyos helyzetekben nagyon kiegyensúlyozatlannak tűnhet, minden lapnak megvan az ellenszere, tehát úgy tűnik, hogy a káoszba a fékek és egyensúlyok is jól bele vannak építve.

After the first play this feels like Fluxx: Extended Edition, but this is probably because we were all playing like idiots. (Verified after a few more plays that yes, we were.)

After 32 plays, this game is still chaotic and reminiscent of Fluxx, but unlike Fluxx it's actually an all-right game.  The randomness results in wildly varied board state from turn to turn, forcing one to make interesting tactical choices instead of just sticking to a strategy.  As a downside, it *is* quite luck-dependent, but less than one would initially believe.  The downside is worth the replayability.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Neat card game with interesting mechanics and lots of player interaction. Heavy gamers may say that there is too much luck for their enjoyment, but what is actually going on is lots of potential for micro-managing your strategy. This game won't reward strategic players who like to plan 4 moves in advance, as you simply can't and shouldn't do this. Instead, I feel this game rewards those who remain flexible, play in the moment, and are capable of adapting to current game conditions.
This game allows for strong offensive cards that yield seemingly ridiculously high points, which can be countered by the right defensive card, if and when played correctly. Lots of "feast or famine" gameplay, but in they end it all balances out. Not my favorite game, but interesting enough I'll play it almost anytime.

*update: raised rating to an 8 after several more enjoyable 2 player games with my wife, and an awesome 4 player team game! Not many games offer team play opportunities, and fewer are actually fun. This game does both well. Not to mention that it is one of the best 2 player games I own, and the wife loves it, which is a huge plus!

OK, so the game does not play well with 4 and has a steep learning curve. Will hold off rating until I play again.

Love this game. I definitely need to play this more.

End goal is to be the first to grab 6 achievements or complete alternative win conditions. I love how you have to balance using cards with playing them. If you lose icon advantages your cards, no matter how excellent, are useless (at least for dogmas). 

I was cruising one game with an early 4-0 achievement lead but my wife successfully stopped me dead in my tracks. That's one reason why this game is great. You need to be adaptable and push whatever advantage you have as long as you have it and then scheme out your next one.

Based off one play so it could improve.  It seems very fiddly for a card game.  I seemed to be constantly counting symbols, counting points, multiplying x 5 for Dominations, reading opponents cards, reading my own cards.....but I spent very little time actually enjoying the game.  The constant fiddliness/arithmetic got in the way of the strategy for me.

It's an ingenious concept for a card game from the creator of Glory to Rome but falls flat for me after only a few plays because it feels like the game is playing you rather than the other way around.

A lot of icons to keep track of and no way to really read the small text on your opponent's cards to figure out what he might do.  Hard to figure out strategy.  I guess you have to know all the cards and frankly I can't be bothered.  There's so many more interesting games to waste my time on.

Exceeded expectations. I thought it was only going to be a good 2 player game, but I've got in some good 3 and 4 player games too. I like how there are so many cards that you feel must utterly break the game (but, really, don't in practice)

RATING: 6.9
It's a good game, but not for me. Too many choices, too much chaos from turn to turn, too much player conflict. Reminds me of Fluxx if it were much more complicated. I enjoyed it, but I would not seek out this game to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the unique play and the icon mechanism to determine who gets to participate in an action or is targeted.  I also like the 5 piles with splaying.  However, overall, the game just feels a bit too confrontational and chaotic.  I like the idea that I'm building up and improving my civilization, but my cards are constantly in flux from other player's actions so I can never really plan ahead too far or depend on a certain strategy.  Cool idea, but the attack aspect feels too much like Munchkin and the 'instant win'/'lucky draw' aspect feels too much like Fluxx.  If you like those games, this might be a good step in a deeper direction.  I might enjoy this more if it consistently played in about 30-45 minutes.

Engine Building? Set Collection? Super fun! I could see how some people think that this is a luck game based on what cards are drawn, but with so many cards acquired with so many abilities to do from each card, your ability to decipher which action would work best, and how to plan your turns (this card action first will make it so this card action is better) makes this a strategy game for me. What a great game. A must own, especially at its low price point and Iello's fantastic art compared to the original.

RATING: 8
Just a preliminary rating, the game definitively requires more plays to get a grasp of things. Now I'm just stumbling around aimlessly and have no clue how to stop whoever gets a nice scoring engine going.

Anyhow, this is a chaotic cardgame. Fun and wild with lots of powerful effects throwing haymakers all over. But there is a method to the madness and I trust my Geekbuddies who claim that a strategy emerges as you get to know the cards - and I can see it, because you do get to see most of the cards and can plan around it.

My main complaint is that I doubt I'll ever play it enough to get to that point. Rules on cards and keeping track of every player's tableau is anathema to so many of the people I play with. Also, it's a bit fiddly with the counting of icons, but that comes with experience. I'm mixed to positive but I can see it increasing if I get into it a bit with enthusiastic opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
While I generally have fun playing this, it can be utterly frustrating. Two equal players = completely random outcome. It's too tactical for my tastes with little strategy other than uncover as many icons as possible, hope you get the first imbalanced card.

Only two plays in and it is both chaotic and exciting. Currently fairly overwhelmed in-game but there's a sense that with time I'll learn more of the cards and with greater understanding will come deeper strategy. That said, wow are there some gnarly dogmas out there where opponents can destroy everything you've built leaving you broken and scrambling to catch up. 8/8/16 (7.5)

Updating the rating on this from 7.5 to an 8.  First time I played this game I was not yet ready for the intensity of player interaction (read destruction) but in the past year apparently my tastes/comforts have shifted.  This is really fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
I have some issues with it. The game seems horribly unbalanced with two players, with one person pulling ahead early and keeping the lead based on a lucky starting hand. I've also grown to dislike the text-heavy nature of it, because it takes more time than you have available on your turn to analyse what everyone is capable of and build a strategy. A lot of who does well is luck-based: pulling cards with the right symbols, or with dogmas that combo off each other, or other people not pulling the symbols that you need to control.

It's not a bad game, but every time I play it it feels like I have very little control over my own success or failure - picking the best card you happen to have picked up is not difficult to do, but it's also not overly interesting. You'll be faced with maybe one or two genuine choices that will benefit you and you can safely ignore the others.

Very deep and complex for such a small box.  Daunting to teach but not difficult to play.  Lots of ways to interact with, obstruct, and catch up to opponents, but some of those ways require some luck.  Drawing the right cards at the right time can result in runaway game-winning combos.

RATING: 5.25
The mechanic is quite nice. The problem is that in half of the cases drawing bad cards at the beginning would condition you too much and the only way to overcome the result is again to hope on the luck. Moreover the cards, even within the same epoch, are very umbalanced, some of them are almost useless and you would waste a lot of actions dealing with them.

Absolutely incredible game in a small package. Plays 2 people great but goes up to 4 for pure chaos. It's a game that borrows heavily from Sid Meier's Civilization, but this is no Civ game; it's a pure technological advance game with the great technologies of humankind from the Stone Age up to the Digital Age. 

Lots of interaction, countering, hostile takeover and strategy here, with a healthy dose of luck and you can never count anyone out because one draw could complete a combo that swings the game to his victory. 

It's one of those perfect card games.

Based off one game. I really enjoyed the heck out of it. Will see how it fares based off repeated plays

*edit* Having played this more (especially with 20-something males who have that innate competitive itch), this game is a lot of fun. The idea that at any moment, your carefully constructed board can be wiped to smithereens by some jerk opponent keeps this game fun. And rather than wear out its welcome, the quick progression through the ages makes this game start out a bit dry but quickly become more and more thrilling the longer it goes on!

*later edit* After playing this multiple times (10+), I now see that there is strategy in the game, which slowly becomes clearer the more you play it. Play the icons, grasshopper. Play the icons. The dogmas will come, but the icons are your fault.

RATING: 9
Quite chaotic, but all the chaos comes together for a rather nice game.

I have not tried the expansions, and I am a bit annoyed that one of them has front and back of cards aligned differently.

Without expansions the (I think) same  number of cards per age means that in two players rushing through tech levels is much stronger than with four. In the latter case, the lower ages will run out quickly enough so just drawing a lot will be fine. (In contrast, if you are rushing then drawing a lot might help your opponent catch up.)

RATING: 8
Great mixture of tactical decisions and a bit of luck (card draw). You have meaningful decisions to make without the game being too complex or complicated.
Each game develops quite different.
Needs 1-2 playthroughs to catch the interaction between the mechanisms baut afterward runs smoothly. So give it a second chance if your first play doesn't convince you instantly.

Very interesting mechanics.  Lots of convolution / interaction (with yourself and with others), all in a fun way.  

Hard to not see this game as too random.  If you aren't good enough, it will be a random game to you.  I haven't gotten good enough to make it not random to me.  But I see the possibility, and have a huge desire to play more.  

I can tell it feels heavy to my group though (on the level of Agricola).  Though they love the idea of playing it more, they grumble whenever I mention playing it "now".  Meaning I'm in slightly too light of a gaming group.  But I still have fun with their company and with what we play.

RATING: 5.5
Intriguing and overwhelming at the same time. I played casually, not bothering to read which of the 100+ unique cards my opponents were threatening me with and waiting for them to announce how they were hitting me, which actually worked out just fine. The game would probably be at least as fun after gaining familiarity of the cards and planning more strategically, though mixing players at the different levels would not produce a good experience.

I feel the designer is reacting to complaints about Glory to Rome, whether his own or his detractors', and I'm intrigued by the concept though I don't share the motivation. At first glance I worry it has a worse runaway leader problem and a different kind of learning curve (the explosion of card effects and their combinations is both larger and more impactful than that of the buildings in GtR, even if the basic action mechanisms are fewer and simpler) so it is more likely to be a stylistic difference for the audience. I'd like to try it again.

After half a dozen plays, I'm agreeing with the common complaint that this game is too chaotic and lucky. At times chaos is fun. At times it just feels punishing. I always seem to splay last. I'd really like to get in some two-player games to verify if the strategy goes up, as reported.

RATING: 4.5
Played once with four players (with the "team" variant where the played as two teams of two).  

In this game players built up a tableau of cards in front of them, with a goal of either scoring points or getting achievements (which often take points to get).  Cards have both symbols on them and special power text; when activating the special power text either all players with fewer symbols than you carry out the text, or all players with an equal or higher number than you carry out the text.  While this is a really cool mechanic (it means that if you have a special power that helps you, but someone else has as many symbols as you, then both of you carry it out), it leads to _insane_ complexities in a four player game.  We often would sit there for minutes looking over all five of our special powers, counting up everyone's symbols, and then planning moves accordingly.  And since the symbol counts change with every played card, things change rapidly (meaning planning ahead is tough).

To draw cards you pick from one of ten numbered piles, and can only draw cards from piles you've played in your tableau.  If there are no cards in the pile you want to draw from, then you draw from the next higher pile. This is another clever technique, as it slowly progresses the game to more advanced cards.  And, since scoring is based on the same "draw" mechanic, it means that if you are supposed to score "2", but there aren't any 2's, 3's, or 4's, then you score a "5" instead.

However, the game is, well, broken in my view.  Each card is unique, and has often-complicated special power text on it "I demand that you give me this card, then you can take a card from me, then I have to get you a soda, and you need to give me X-3/24 victory points".  While this excites special-power-card players who want to build the perfect combo, it just led to a tremendous amount of analysis-paralysis.  

Our game took close to two hours, and only ended because my team assembled a near-broken combo using the over-powered "Anatomy" card (wherein I could force our opponents to discard all of their points as well as cards from their tableau, holding them in perfect check while my opponent scored points without opposition). 

Overall I find this game entirely uninteresting; the special powers lead to incredible chaos during gameplay, and seem likely to lead to game-ends like we had (where one person blows the rest out of the water).

At first I wasn't sure what to think of this game. Some cards are overpowered and plenty of broken combo's to exploit. After a few plays I am totally sold on this game. The game has a nice buildup and as a two player game it is a great push and pull. The goal is to exploit your broken combos and to cancell out the ones your opponent has. It is swingy and crazy, but it works like a charm. With the echo expansion this game really shines. Acquired taste for sure.

Finally slapped a rating on here, and a high one at that. This game is Chudyk in his prime.

Good stuff, easily kept in a backpack for a game when stuck somewhere.

Had an absolutely brilliant first game of this - thoroughly enjoyed it. The mechanics are essentially simple with only a choice of a few basic actions you can perform, but the strategic choices are vast!

Can lead to a little bit of AP as you consider your cards and those of your opponents to see if dogma effects will work in your favour now, or if it's best to leave for a future turn.

Deciding whether to meld over the top of a great dogma effect is also another choice you must consider.

I won easily by collecting 6 achievements on my first game compared to 3 for my opponent.

First impression is an 8, as good or maybe better than Glory to Rome. We'll see how it holds up.

Innovation is the better 2-player game, Glory to Rome is better for 3-4.

Innovation is wonderful, full of broken cards and combos. Those bothered by large swings in fortune and lots of aggression need not apply. My wife and I LOVE Innovation as a 2-player game.

Regarding Glory to Rome vs Innovation:

It's hard to put into words. I feel like Innovation is a little snappier, a little faster-moving without sacrificing any of the interesting bits. The game state is a little more fragile and volatile as well. The technologies in Innovation are far less permanent than they are in GtR, so it rewards adaptation and thinking on one's feet a little bit more. GtR has more of the slow, lay-a-building-down-then-try-to-get-the-materials-into-it play.

Maybe Innovation just appeals to the impatient gamer in me. I feel like I get into a rhythm with Innovation that I never get with Glory to Rome, so maybe I just need more experience with the latter. I prefer the faster tempo of Innovation. 

Looking back at my logged plays I see that not a single month has gone by without at least one play of Innovation since I bought it in August of 2010. That's pretty telling.

Very, very good. I like this one a lot. Lots of moving parts, and I'm not sure there's always that much control, but I like the experience. There's always a way to come back and always some interesting unforeseen card interaction. Weak cards can become strong cards in surprising ways. Love it.

Enthusiastic.

RATING: 10
Strange game. All but one of our two-player games have been blowouts, generally alternating between the players. Despite the wide array of cards in the deck, the civilization theme doesn't really click. Also, we never reach the 9s and 10s: another worrisome feature. Yet we enjoy playing and will no doubt try more games. Strange. [8 plays]

Update 1: we've enjoyed some closer games (6-5, 6-4, 6-4) of late, one of them racing up into the 10s for one player. A satisfying trend. [11 plays]

Update 2: well, we continue to play, and despite the lack of control, I guess we've become fans of the game. We wouldn't keep coming back if we weren't, right? No two games are alike, that's for sure. Still haven't seen much of the 9s and 10s. [27 plays]

After playing a dozen two player sessions, I am delighted with this refreshing, clever, and unique card game. I don't think it's as chaotic as it's critics suggest, nor are the cards very difficult to learn. Once you gain familiarity with the cards, you have a good understanding of the flow of the game. As many other reviewers have pointed out, there are innumerable combinations that play out differently depending on the sequence and order of the tableaux. 

Innovation is about emerging properties and unfolding layers of consequences. This is one of the most interesting new games I have played in a long time. There's alot to think about. It's intense. But I also find it relaxing and very enjoyable. Great replayability and a whole lot of fun. 

On further plays, I realize that Innovation rewards improvisational and creative thinking. Although there are surely analytics involved, so often a player will come up with some clever solution to a seemingly insurmountable mess. Some people find order in chaos!

Even after several plays, this game still feels more like Fluxx than Glory to Rome. I'll take other BGGers' word for it that Innovation's depth reveals itself with further play, but I'm just not captivated enough by it to get to know the game better. More importantly, my girlfriend feels the same way, and she's usually more of a fan of these card combo games than I am. Since this is best as a 2-player game, and she's my 2-player partner, this game's out.

A few neat ideas, especially the resource management with unfolding your card piles. Illustrations are also not bad.
Other than that, nice meaty game ruined by the fact that some of the cards are awfully strong and you see your civilization, built piece by piece in the last 20 minutes, to turn into dust in a mere turn. I guess this simulates the real civilizations, too... but as an euro player it's not something I want to see in my games. :)

I would prefer to play it house-ruled (eg. forbidding to activate the same card twice in one turn, because some cards are really mean) and I'll probably play again, but not rushing.

Ten stacks of cards in a circle represent the different ages of civilization, from antiquity through the modern era. Players will acquire cards and slowly work up the ladder of these decks, trying to outwit their opponents with clever cardplay. The overlaying and "splaying" of cards creates really dynamic scenarios, but powerful cards can also cause one player to leapfrog ahead of the others. I suspect experience could help mitigate this possibility, but it can be frustrating for newer players. Still, it's a smart, mindbending game.

Excellent 2-player card game. Plays quick and the different card combos and multiple victory conditions mean the game feels different each time. It can be incredibly "swingy" but players who fall behind are never truly out of it. One of my favourite purchases of 2016.

The more I play this the more I like it. It takes a lot of experience to learn how to handle the wild swings and to realize which cards are good for what. I'm still mediocre at it but find it an adventure every time. Haven't yet played with expansions but look forward to this.

Main things I've gleaned so far:
1) scoring early is a minor concern: the major tasks are getting all 5 colours down, building stacks, and splaying. Code of Laws and Sailing are ace.
2) tech up as quickly as you can (but don't cover up useful cards too soon)--Mathematics is particularly handy for this--and keep an eye for the attacks you're vulnerable: stealing from your hand, your score pile or your board? Plan accordingly.
3) lightbulbs, leaves and crowns are valuable in all ages; towers are nasty early on but a huge liability later.
4) try to snag a few achievements for individual ages or the 5 special achievements, to avoid losing early on, but also try to tech up efficiently to ages 8-10 so you have access to the big game-ending cards before opponents do, and then use them to shut the game down quickly or (if you're ahead in the score pile) try to draw an 11.

As with Tash-Kalar or Blue Moon, I love the individuality of the cards: you grow to anticipate each one coming up, and learn the ways they interact.

In retrospect, this game is far less chaotic than other games from this designer, but there's still sometimes a sense of hopelessness as you struggle to find a card combination that works for you. I also wish that it was easier for victories to happen when you go to draw numbers higher than 10. Still, this is the definitive version of this game, and I really like the subtle changes iEllo made to the design.

Innovation reminds about Glory to Rome with its innovative use of playing cards. The cards in this game do not only have different functions such as abilities, colors, symbols and score but they can also be organized so that underlying cards contribute to your strength in different ways. Like in most card games, it's an advantage to know the many different cards and how they can be combined and the weak theme and extensive use of small text don't help. It's also difficult to follow a strategy since you're almost completely dependent on which cards you draw (and which your opponents let you keep). Nevertheless, Innovation may offer a lot of tactical highlights in the choice of card function as well as interaction in the struggle for score cards and majorities.

The best card game I own, in my opinion.

So many possibilities, so much strategy, and ingenious mechanics.

The only reason I didn't rate a 10 is because of the lack of card art and because a 10 is perfect -- no game is perfect.

THE CARD GAME for strategists.

Purchased unplayed, I LIKE Glory to Rome.  Played 3 times, and think it is horrible.  To gain achievements, you must have some Dogma that allows you to SCORE cards.  If, as in my 3 times of playing, you do not GET a tech that allows you to score, then winning the game isn't to likely. FAR to chaotic for me, and I like a game with a bit of randomness.
I have no idea how people are comparing this to Race for the Galaxy.

There are lots of texts on cards and effects are very swingy - just like Glory to Rome. However, while Glory to Rome feels a bit repetitive, Innovation is more exciting as there are more combination of cards doing different things, and you feel like you are progressing and racing to the victory - in which Glory to Rome can drag on even if you want it to end. 

The only possible downside is the long texts of cards that may intimidate new players. (and players who insist to read every cards opponents played to make their moves)

RATING: 8
In this civilization themed card game, one either draws cards, plays them on the table, or uses the special effect of the card. Each card has a number of symbols on it, so when you use the effect of the card, your opponents can also use the ability if they have at least the same number of symbols as you. Some effects are "demand" type effects which usually take away something from your opponents, but again, if you have at least the same symbols you are immune to the effect. Other effects allow you to "splay" your cards, so that even though cards on top of another, you can overlap symbols to give you more power.

The cards are ordered from level 1 to 10, with the more powerful cards at the higher levels. You start slowly at level 1 and work your way upwards. You win by getting a number of achievement cards which you pay for with scored cards. There are other sudden death win conditions as well.

Yes, there could be very destabilizing cards, but that is part of the game, and it's fun, and should play quickly with 2-3 players. With 4 players, I recommend the team game, otherwise it may be a long game. I'm enjoying this game, and looking forward to more plays, since I am only just scratching the surface.

Proud participant in the great Innovation Assembly Party of 2010.

I think it's a mistake to call this a civilization-building game.  That labels carries strong connotations that aren't on Innovation's agenda;  this is a take-that card game with a technology tree theme.  The "Fluxx for gamers" label is more accurate, but far less appealing.

Anyway, this is a chaotic game, but not in a way that I find irritating or highly prone to long streaks of bad luck.  Tons and tons of bizarre and interesting things can and will happen, and the replay value is immense.  Innovation occupies a prestigious spot in my game collection.

Very simple rules with an endless supply of unique and interesting card interactions. Every game is a learning experience. My favorite part of the game is the "Ah ha!" moments when a certain strategy/combinationn suddenly becomes clear. Easily one of my favorites and will be for a long time. My only complaint is the chaotic gameply with more than 3 players, but this should be remedied by new cards in the upcoming expansion.

I've read several complaints about this game.  I've read that it's too luck driven and chaotic.  The people that are complaining about these items haven't played enough to gain the card knowledge (which is important), or aren't playing well enough to control the chaos.

I have played this game over 30 times, and I can honestly say that it gets better and better.  At first the game seems random and chaotic, but as you play the game more, and get familiar with the cards the game play isn't as chaotic and luck driven as one may first think.  

I'm happy I've continued playing this game, because it quickly jumped to the top of my 'favorites' list.

My experience of the game thus far (about 20 plays solo and 2p) is summed up in [thread=616950]this excellent review[/thread].

Downgraded after another 20+ plays. Now that we're both experienced in the game, the majority of our plays now end in blowouts, with 6-1/6-0 games being quite common. We've aborted several recent games due to this, but keep coming back to it in the hopes of getting into a tight game (where it's great). I was up 3-0 after the 1st few turns of our last game with a good streak using Metalworking (which he had no way of defending against). It didn't take long for me to go up 5-0 whereupon we agreed that it was pointless and put it back in the box.

Update: tried the Soloplay 2p variant and on 1st blush will likely bump the rating up again.

After 2nd play with the 2p variant, rating is back up to 8. This variant has saved the game for us. Excellent!

RATING: 10
It's incredible how much fun this game is considering its near bare-bones approach in art/graphic design and that it is basically a card game with 100 cards.

Once you understand the most-likely foreign playing terms of meld, tuck, splay and achieve, you'll be able to analyze every single card on your own, and gauge its immediate significance.  Now, to know what every card can do for you in the long term, well, that requires many playing sessions.

The progression from Age 1 cards with simple effects to Age 10 cards with crazy effects is a pleasant experience, as you feel your abstract civilization is growing and becoming more powerful, while giving you plenty more options to consider for your measly 2-actions-per-turn limit.  

The beautiful part comes in the combos that cards from all ages can potentially make.  You might think that a lowly Age card is useless, but if it is paired with the right card, it could make the opponent hurt in a most enjoyable way.  

Just as surprising, my girlfriend really got into it mid-way through our first game, and then asked to play it the very next day.  It is definitely a great 2-player game, which based on what everyone else has said, it should be its standard playing limit.  I can see how chaotic it would play with more than 2, plus there are a lot of tactical choices to consider on a player's turn, that with more than 2, it would bog down and wouldn't emphasize the flow of "if-you-play-that-I'll-counter-with-this".

Definitely try it out.  For a while I was thinking of getting the international edition with pretty pictures and such, but it is really inconsequential on the enjoyment you'll derive from its gameplay. Plus, the international edition has changed the terms and even some cards.

Update 1:  When the Deluxe Edition kickstarter popped up, there was no way in hell I wouldn't signed up for it.  Eagerly awaiting for its arrival in summer '16.

Update 2: Still waiting for Deluxe version but I got the old versions ready to be played at any time.

No question, I love this game, but only with 2 players!

The more I play, the less I feel certain cards break the game. Sure, there's power disparity (and Coal and Canning will always be strong), but nothing is "I land this and I win no matter what I've been doing before this". Except maybe some of the 10s, but getting to the 10s is a feat in and of itself.

An exercise in managed chaos. Frustrating gamestate tracking with up to 15 dogmas in play (plus consideration of to-be-played ones), and 6 scores per player that are constantly changing.

RATING: 1
GF gave me this because I'm a big fan of Carl Chudyk's Glory to Rome and it was recommended by well known reviewers having opinions we used to care about. First letdown: no theme whatsoever and new "splay" mechanic is a total fluke - cards have more symbols at the bottom than at either side so you'll always splay them south. Compare to GtR in which anyone has a chance to put great cards into play since when you draw cards, you draw to your full hand size, here, you just draw one, hope and loose half a turn for it. In GtR, unbalance of cards is elegantly countered by the time you gotta spend to build them and the influence players have on available materials; in Innovation, cards need no time nor materials to be abused. In GtR, no card is better than a good combo; in Innovation, you've got despicably abusive single card loopholes. So while GtR is thematic (walls protect, forge gives materials etc.), tactical (multi-usage cards) and strategic (combo string and action selection), Innovation is the regress to utterly luck driven, meaningless piece of unfulfilling garbage with the worst case of luck swings ever seen.

[i]Cherry on top: the game's core is all about majorities yet there's nothing in the box to mark their fluctuations - pretty easy to tell when there's 4 cards on the table, a lil' less in mid game when everyone has 15 cards of 3 symbols among 6 different possible shapes in front of them.[/i]

I only played this card game two player.  I was not too keen on this game at first because over the course of the game your opponent can steal your cards, use that too advance himself to the next 'age' and get to even more useful cards.  It hurt and frustrated me, but I stuck to it and eventually after only 2 or 3 turns I was right back in the game.

Too swingy of a game for me, but would try again now that I understand this.

RATING: 9
In 5 solo (Left hand vs. right) games, I've seen Fission fail, Electricity succeed, Coal blast through points before Age 3 was even complete, and Fermenting eat through the deck.  

Some people might call this chaotic.  I call it tactical.  With chaos, I feel out of control with either zero options or none that will make any difference.  With tactics, I feel that I can sway the playing field in my favor through good decisions.

This game is making me refine what I mean by thematic.  It obviously does not have bits and pieces that represent nations, territory, armies, etc.  The cards have no cool pictures of the technologies they represent.  But the more I play, the more I am amazed how thematically the cards use the board.  Sailing, an early achievement, would seem to help a nation diversify its' knowledge quickly.  However, after a short while, its' usefulness as a primary driver of new ideas is superseded by other, more useful concepts.  In one game, I felt the overwhelming rush of the current era (10), where it seems impossible to keep up with the changes going on.  I sensed how the incremental discoveries of ideas got faster and pushed the game toward a frenzied end.

Why this is not a 10:
+ I can see myself not always wanting to play
+ It has a constantly tactical nature, which would get tiresome after [long] awhile - I want just a touch more strategy.

RATING: 8
Interesting card-combo/tableau-building game with lots of different effects. I'm partial to the civ theme, and the progression through the ages provides a strong narrative arc, although the connection between the card names and effects is weak at best.

There is a fine balance to be tread between achieving icon superiority, tech-ing up and scoring; I tend to prioritise strongly in that order, often to my detriment.

I find it difficult to formulate any sort of coherent strategy, given the inability to control the cards drawn; I suspect this game is far more tactical.

The zero amount of effort on the card artwork jars; they could have tried to put some illustrations on the cards at least! As it is, it looks like a prototype.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Since all the cards have fairly complicated actions, I don't think that there is much likelihood that this game could have much strategic planning. Basically, you just look at what you have and try to make some points out of it. I wasn't really paying all that much attention to what other people had since it could change so easily.

After a second play, I think this game is too chaotic. I was effectively taken out of the game after a round or two since my cards kept getting stolen. Once you're behind in this one, there is virtually no way to make up any lost ground. If you're weak, you are going to be targeted by other cards, which will only serve to keep you down. If people are more equal, then there is more uncertainty about who will win, but there is much back and forth in this one, I wouldn't say that it's about planning. If you get a card that has a power that works with your setup, then you will do well, otherwise, you're going to fall behind.

This is a bit like Race for the Galaxy in the same way that it needs a tight group to play the hell out of it before it becomes a decent game.

Glorious, glorious theme and implementation, but it does feel just a little bit too 'runaway' for its own good. Very much requires someone of the same skill level to enjoy playing it, and therefore completely pointless for the average game-night group. A specialised game for specialised crowds.

Further Thoughts: You know what? All the fun is getting sucked out of this quickly. There's just not enough viable control or strategy. I'm going back to Glory To Rome. Downgraded from 7.5 to 6.

RATING: 9
Apart from Hansa Teutonica, Innovation is the most exciting game I've played this year. It's simple and fast, yet deep enough in some of the tactical possibilities to be pleasing. As I mentioned previously: High-glass débutante Race for the Galaxy got crazy drunk one night and woke up in bed with both Fluxx AND Glory to Rome. Nine months later little Innovation was born. It will take a paternity test to find out which one is the real father...

Because of the fixed number of cards and achievements, gameplay varies wildly based on the number of players. With 2 it is strategic and you progress relatively slowly. With 4, progression is rapid, scoring can be dramatic, and the game can end very quickly.

Initially this game seems just super random and broken, but once you get a hang of it and get to know what the cards can actually do, to what extend and how to get some combos I think it's great fun (when played with 2 players, I'm not so thrilled by it at higher playercounts as it gets a bit too crazy then, but 2 player is great)

I'd like to play it again mainly because its by the same guy that did glory to rome, so I'd like to give it another chance.

The wife and I both love it! It's a lot of fun, even when you lose, unless you get blown out. Which does happen. We have recently implemented a house rule regarding splaying that helps slow down the runaway leader problem (in our opinion).

Still not quite sure. Mechanics are very intersting, but I can't quite figure out is it all about card-luck, as if you don't get something good to abuse you gonna have a bad day, or there's some possibilities to work around that.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I have owned both the Iello and Asmadi version of this game and have traded them both away. (I prefer the graphic design and simplicity of the Asmadi version, I hated the art in the Iello version). I've come to realize that Chudyk games aren't for me (except GtR) because of the high chaos factor and all of the info you need to keep tracking while playing.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays well with 2.
- There are a lot of cards in this game which leads to an unbelievable amount of potential interactions between cards.
- The Fission card: Wow; this went off in one of our games and it was crazy, it basically resets the game and destroys everything you have done.
- However; I find the game a bit too random and swingy.
- You don't always feel like it was your skill that caused you to win; instead you got lucky with a few card draws.
- I also found that the game usually ends way before you get to the higher ages (8 - 10) which means you very rarely see very many of those cards.[/i]

This game is amazing in that it fits so much depth in such a small container. The whole use of language is at first disconcerting (tucking, splaying, etc.) but it begins to make sense after a while, it reminds me of race for the galaxy where it uses this weird esoteric way of communicating things. But it plays out beautifully and has great player interactions. I guess my only other knock is the sudden reversal of fortune that seems to happen, you could have a huge commanding lead, or what you think is a commanding lead and then lose the game. Maybe its a matter of valuing things differently.

規則:
*將1~10時代牌照牌背分類洗勻，每種再拿一張放到中央當作成就卡，旁邊放五張特殊成就卡
*每人從時代1抽兩張，一張打出，字母靠前的順位先，2人時首家獲是四人時首兩家只有一個行動
*玩家輪流行動，每次有兩個行動點，每個行動可選
>抽一張牌 根據你目前場上牌的最高數字，抽對應數字的牌，如果該牌沒有往下抽，如果等級較低的都沒有就抽目前最低的
>出一張牌  蓋在同色牌上方，如果該色已經展開則照展開的方式放置
>啟動場上一張牌的效果  所有場上對應符號跟你一樣多的玩家都強迫做，或是不能成為目標，順序為你的左手玩家先開始，你尾家，只要有一個玩家做你就之後抽一張牌
>拿成就  面前的頂牌要有一張比目標成就卡高，且分數要是目標成就卡的五倍才能拿，拿到時放在自己個人圖板右邊，不需要支付分數
*特殊成就卡一達成條間就免費拿，同時達成就從行動玩家順時針順位先拿
*遊戲在2/3/4人時先拿到6/5/4成就的贏，或是當要抽超過時代10的卡時結束，分數高獲勝

I don't think the rules were explained to me properly but I was thoroughly bored and confused by this while another player simply gave up and started playing Animal Crossing on her Nintendo DS. Have since seen another table thoroughly bored and confused as they struggled through the rules so although my initial experience has mellowed that hapless table remains as a stark reminder not to give this a second chance.

An interesting game of collecting and placing cards to your tableau, looking for powers that complement each other and striving to gain majorities in the various symbols that drive the powers so as to allow you to execute them without people riding on your coat-tails Puerto Rico style. Your normal actions are to draw a card, play a card or execute a power, and you get two actions. The card powers in the lower decks are weak (you collectively start with deck 1 and work up to deck 10) but each higher deck has more and more powerful powers, becoming quite dramatic in the top decks. Powers range from better card drawing, being able to spread cards so symbols underneath count towards your majorities, to stealing cards from other players and, of course, scoring. You can only have 1 active power in each colour, so there are continual decisions on foregoing a useful power to get a different one. Another is on whether to just concentrate on building symbol majorities now and worry about scoring later, or go for the quick scoring grabs now to minimise the required effort later. If you want to do one of your powers when you don't have the majority in the particular symbol it requires, you can still do it, but everyone with equal or more in that symbol can also do it, so that can be an interesting decision at times. Lots of cards and powers disappear through the game, so games range from highly interactive with lots of pussage to quiet scoring engine type games, and anywhere in between. And like the Melbourne weather, potentially all in one game. I found my initial plays entertaining and it was interesting to see how it unravels differently each time. There's potential for rich-get-richer and player carnage, but I don't mind that in a card-power game that's over in a decent timeframe. One of the other attractions (to me, but can be considered turnoffs to many) is the ebb and flow in scoring power through the game and the possibility of huge come-from-behind wins - there's always hope once you move into the powerful cards of the final decks.

What I like:
- Portable
- Pretty quick to teach and play (60 minute 4p learning game)
- The attacks are mostly non-targeted

What I don't like:
- Not a fan of "special ability" and combo card games
- Seemed like some "rich get richer" aspects (although also with a few catchup mechanisms)
- It's frustrating when your best play also happens to benefit the leader
- The theme is even thinner than most light civ games

Playing this the first time was very disorienting. You have no idea what kinds of cards are even in the game. Many of the card abilities are tricky, and require very careful reading to get right. 

It's an odd mix of high randomness (what cards you get) combined with skill needed to actually recognize and execute the right combinations. Some bash-the-leader seems expected/required.

I will admit that my initial opinion of this was much lower than it is now. It seems to be the kind of game that gets much better when everyone (or most) know all the cards by name. When I initially earned it, we were all fumbling. When I played with another group who owned it, they were much more knowledgeable and strategic. After they house banned "Oars" I had a lot more fun and my initial claim of it having a disgusting slippery slope with not counterplay was refuted.

RATING: 9
I disliked this game and then found myself enamored with it. The chaos initially seemed intense but then it became manageable. Of course some games get thrown by craziness (luck or misfortune) but they pass quickly enough to say "oh well" and then turn toward the next bout. It really is best as a two-player game, the randomness and delay that a third person creates seems unnecessary. That said, I'll play this game as a third person game over many other games, which says a lot for it. I think I like best how you really need to act and react and sometimes even "pray" as you play. I haven't yet gotten used to the expansions so I still mostly play without them, for now, at least.

Innovation doth rock the house.  It might even be my preferred 2-person card game over Dominion these days.  I'll need to think on that one a bit more.  The ability to play Dominion online gives it the edge, but if Innovation ever gets a good iOS app, look out.

[b]2/10/13[/b]: Innovation now has an online version by the Isotropic Dominion guy!  I've played maybe 10 games so far, and while it has some rough edges, it definitely scratches the itch.  Games run longer than Dominion, though, so I won't play it as often.  Advantages over the physical version: running icon count and instant awarding of the special achievements.  Also, being able to read opponent's cards right-side-up is surprisingly useful.

Based on one play: A very interesting mechanic. You play cards in order to move up in levels and have to get achievements to win. However, the innovations you place in front of you all have powers and you need to have more of a symbol then others to be able to use the powers without others also using it. Based on what you draw, you hope that your cards will remain so that you can build a combo, but there is a lot of back and forth between players, so from one turn to another things can change and you need to rethink your strategy (if you can have one at all). Interesting mechanic, but at the end, fairly luck based and dependent on whether you get targeted a lot by others.

Nobody ever called Innovation dull.  Ridiculously chaotic, sure.  Overly random? That too.  But every time I play I see more depth. More wrinkles. And I can't stop thinking about it.

This crazy card game really struck a good vibe with me.  You're playing cards down on the table to get their special abilities, but also to get icons, which let you leech off of other's abilities and prevent others from leeching off yours.  It's fun trying to make combos, and the game really keeps you interested in what your opponents are doing, since you may be able to use each other's abilities depending on your icon totals.  Yes, it has a good bit of randomness, but I just find it to be a lot of fun.

5-13-13: rating 8 based on a few incomplete solitaire plays. 6-24-13: played 4 games in a row, and would have played 40 more. Fantastic! Like all card games with unique cards, will take many plays to learn interactions... Upgrading to a 9. [Oct 2013] this game has hooked me, and a number of my gaming friends. After 25  plays including online, I am fascinated by it. Almost a perfect balance of chance with strategic and tactical play. I have enjoyed 3-player and 4-player as well, but it does take considerably longer for what it is. I would still play in a second because I love this game so much. Planning to play a few dozen more times at least as base, and then introduce an expansion to my group. This is a game I can get my 15-year old son to play with me eagerly, which is difficult to do. 10-13 gave to a friend, will be re-buying at some point. [6/2014] Repurchased at Gamers Edge, also both expansions. Loving Innovation even more! Purchased a spare deck for $10 along with Impulse from publisher directly, rec'd in July 2014.

This game is so much fun.  You get what you can when you can, before the next big event that completely changes your situation.  It feels chaotic, but not out of control, which is a great combo for a fun card game.

11/23/12 - Rating from an 8 to a 9; this game fires on all cylinders, and with all player counts.  It's a huge hit with all my gaming friends.  You have a good amount of control in this game, something that's not readily apparent, but there are so many cool combinations that can go to work for you.  Excellent game!

3/5/16 - Rating up yo a 10, I am always excited to play this game even after dozens of plays. Just played an excellent 2p game this afternoon unlike any game I've played yet where I was drawing my first age 2 cards while my opponent had already melded age 7 cards! This game can get very lopsided, but never feels oppressive. I kept drawing, waiting to get a card allowing me to switch top cards, and utilizing my castle-symbol abilities that gave my neolithic civ some slight advantages. I still lost, but it was close, and I felt satisfied with my effort after my opponents' crazy opening rounds consecutively drawing and melding into the next age.

Eh, it's ok I guess. A little too abstract for my tastes. Interesting mechanics. Felt a little swingy and wild, but it seems like if you really know what you are doing you could pull a win more often than not. 

I'm sure with more plays the score would go up some, but I don't think this would go above an 8 for me.

Objectively speaking I think this game could really appeal to some people, so for those people it could be a 9. It's definitely a try before you buy kind of game. Some compare it to Race for the galaxy, but I think overall Race is probably the better game with all it's expansions. Race also feels less abstract to me.

Really enjoying this 5 plays in. Like other card-based games (RftG, for example), it will take some more plays to learn the deck and become comfortable with the combos and strategies. So far, though, we've seen a wide range of approaches be successful, from an early scoring blitz to teching up quickly to one of the age 10 win-condition changers. 

I love the theme, and the selection of technologies is fantastic. There are quite a few non-obvious ones that, surprisingly for a non-war game, make you think about the history behind the game. "Canning" seems a little silly the first time you see it, but really, long-term preservation of healthy food is a big deal. 

I'm definitely inclined to think this game is at it's best with fewer players, as it becomes much more unstable with more.

Not going to rate it yet (just one play), but it feels like a grown-up's version of Fluxx.  Very chaotic, as one's crafted plans frequently fall apart suddenly, as folks can meld, then dogma without a chance to defend yourself, and it feels like you're at the mercy of the luck of the draw if you want to stop someone who gets a powerful combo.  That said, it's a very clever game, and I can see how playing it consistently with the same people would make it more interesting (it seems to have good replayability).  In these days of countless games to play, though, I'm not sure I see myself investing in it enough to make it worthwhile.

meh.  came highly touted (now ranked 206), but (initially, at least) did not live up to the rep.  interesting system, with its own principles and vocabulary.  splaying mechanism is novel.  but it didn't feel to me like a very generous or predictable system.  gaining higher techs doesn't seem to yield that much of a bonus, and building a position with a long-term strategy seems pointlessly difficult.  but perhaps repeated play will alter my opinion.

the theme is really pasted on:  there is virtually no relation between what a tech is called and what it does.

I really like this game, but I have found out a couple issues with actually playing it. First, some people despise it, because it seems a bit chaotic. Second, I had the misfortune of playing this with a guy who took his sweet time to think about every possible combination and read every card like twenty times. This is the kind of game where the flow is good once you know the cards pretty well. A good player will know which cards are played, which are left and plan his strategy accordingly. The game mechanics may also take a bit for people to take full advantage of. I would heavily suggest to those teaching the game to not go for a full game, and instead show specific instances of situations before hand. There is very little chance a first time player will win unless someone that knows the game actually gives the game up.
Finally, the game does require interaction, and you will be messing up other peoples games and vice-versa. This means some people may get mad at you when you keep pulling off the same crippling move over and over.
I really like the concept of the game, and the competitive aspect of it, but it is definitely not for everyone.

Played a few times and it starts to make sense. At first I was overwhelmed by alla the cards and symbols and conditions.

To be good at this game you have to have a fairly good grasp of not only your own cards but also those of you opponents and what symbols are visible in what amount at any given time.

Tends to be a game that threatens me with AP.

C’est probablement mon jeu de cartes 2 joueurs préféré. Les cartes sont magnifiques : elles ont de belles couleurs, des symboles bien trouvés et les différents domaines et civilisations laissent libre cours à l’imagination. 

Pour gagner, vous avez trois options : 
-	accumuler un maximum de points d’influence dès le début pour pouvoir acheter des périodes, 
-	opter pour la production de ressources qui permet aussi de débloquer des domaines, 
-	ou tenter de faire évoluer votre civilisation le plus rapidement possible pour débloquer des cartes plus élevées (à partir du niveau 8 les conditions des dogmes de certaines cartes peuvent vous permettre de gagner en quelques coups). 
En matière de gestion des ressources, certaines cartes permettent de décaler une pile de couleur dans plusieurs orientations : ce système ingénieux permet des évolutions rapides (jusque-là, je n’avais jamais vu ce système). 
Les novices pourront très vite se prendre au jeu puisqu’il suffit de mémoriser quelques règles de base pour pouvoir jouer, l’essentiel étant écrit sur les cartes. 
Si le jeu de base vous plait et que vous préférez les parties qui durent 2/3 heures, je recommande l’extension Innovation: Echoes of the Past qui permet d’optimiser le jeu en limitant le facteur chance.

RATING: 8
Innovation is an incredible game where you stack cards in colored piles. The idea is on your turn chose 2 actions, which for the most part will be draw a card, play a card or activate a card. When a card activates, if another player has equal or more matching symbols to you, they get the card effect as well, before you do. If the type of effect is attack-ish, then if they have more symbols they are immune to the effects. The game also has mechanisms by which you can spread your card piles out in different directions revealing the icons of cards played earlier in the game that were covered by better cards. The game is intense, with tons of player interaction and digging for cards to keep up with or counter your opponents. As the game progresses cards get more and more crazy, so the tension really ramps up.

There are so many cards with different effects in this game that the game can start to feel too random. For example, if your opponent has an effective attack card, it could be a few turns before you manage to draw an effective defense card, if you do at all. This can discourage people from wanting to play again, even though once seen, allowing yourself to be vulnerable to these cards becomes a calculated risk. 

The game also works poorly with more than 3 players, as if you let all players effect all players, the chaos gets more chaotic, and if you play with the rule that your effects only impact the players directly to your left and right, then when the opponent across from you starts to win, there's not much you can do.

Looks complicated.

Update:  ...but isn't really, once you get your head around the point of the game.  And I enjoyed this enormously when I got to that place.  
Innovation is a fantastic card game that feels like a Euro without the board, the wooden pieces, and the pretense.
Sure, the theme is somewhat abstracted, but the game itself is fast playing, brutal fun loaded with special powers on the cards (called "dogmas") that either benefit you, or help the entire table.  
I will say, however, that I can understand why opinions are divided on it. It can be a little nasty, and there is a runaway leader issue.  But I really, really like it.

:thumbsup: Love, love, love this game! Innovation has been our most played game so far and the most rewarding. It's my poster-child for dynamic games because there is so much to consider with each hand of cards, the game state is constantly changing, and the possibilities are numerous every turn. It happened to be a style of game that clicked with me immediately. For those who lean towards well-developed strategies, it might be a hard game to switch gears for as it will only punish attempts at long-term thinking. For a gut player, it comes naturally. After repeated play, my husband and I have seen that it is possible to mitigate the chaos of the game. It becomes a fine balance between short-term advantages and knowing when to ditch them for something new. The decisions are tough as you are faced with the cost/benefit analysis of brutalizing your opponent vs actions that are more directly beneficial to your Score Pile or stash of Achievements (sometimes they coincide :p), all while keeping a constant eye on your opponent's cards. The level of tension that mounts as the game progresses into the higher Ages is palpable when you know the potentially explosive cards that await. The majority of our games have ended extremely close and even losses can feel amazing after so many critical decisions.  

:thumbsdown: I own the Asmadi version and it's not much to look at. Thematically, some find the theme pasted on but I find the mechanics of the game highly thematic as you learn the cards and see how the actions reflect the technology  named. However, in early plays it's harder to be mindful of those details. At this point, I'm partial to the Asmadi version. There is so much going on action-wise, I think I would find more graphics to be busy and distracting. Charges of randomness are valid as well. Every once in a while we have a stinker of a game where one of us just has way too many powerful cards early on and despite having so many possibilities for actions, the other player just can't catch up. It's going to happen but it happens less and less with more experience. Overall, this aspect does not diminish my enjoyment of the game.

I've been grabbing every chance I get to play it and can't wait for the full release. Glory to Rome is one of my favourites because of its wonderfully crazy combinations and Innovation repeats the same trick in a more streamlined package. There are lots of clever mechanics, particularly the 'splaying' of piles to reveal more icons and the sharing of effects with other players. My only reservation is that it seems hard to come back if you get behind in scoring, and hence achievements. But I'm hoping more plays will show me how to get over that!

UPDATE: they did, and I now think this game is absolutely superb as a 2p. Haven't played much with more.

So far, the game has left quite an impression on me (and my wife) and to-date... this has been the ONLY game we've played 5 times in a row (over 2 days) which can't be said for any other game, including tic-tac-toe.

I like it best with two players for now... but three players isn't bad as well.  I don't see myself playing this with four though (but Team Innovation seem VERY promising)... seems too chaotic.

A very innovative game that I heartily recommend to any gamer.  The only reason I haven't played this more is because of time.  A great game.

RATING: 3
Build your civilization card game. The most interesting part was the dogma special powers which somewhat forces opponents opponents to follow your lead. Also some of the cards that are strong early become less so in future rounds which leads for an attempt at balance. 

It seems to be more tactical at first glance - but I can see that you want setting your tableau for the next round. However, you are at the mercy of the card draw. Some dogma are awesome others utterly worthless. If someone does draw into a nice card they have the game, and you have to struggle to draw into a way to block.

I find it too complex with all the various ways to manage your card options so it is not a simple game. However, it is way too random, without any mitigating factors for deep strategy game. This combination does not appeal to me

I've always played with multiple players. However, much of the commentary says it only plays well with 2 or 3 players.  

However I'm not committed or interested to find out. There are many better 2 player games out there, so I will avoid this one.

RATING: 7
This game is absolutely insane. Other games that are described as 'chaotic' feel like a tea party compared to this. Whatever cards are on the board at any time will likely be gone or buried within five minutes; this game is 99% short-term tactics with almost no long-term strategy. That said, it offers some cool opportunity for clever short-term tactics, and you will be discovering new combos for a loooong time. It's not that well balanced; you have to accept that sometimes one player is going to draw better cards and steamroll the other(s). But it will never happen the same way twice, and Innovation throws enough decisions at you that even if you're getting creamed you feel like there are still some cool things for you to do. Let that help you decide if this game is right for you.

Really a weak attempt at a civilization style game. The cards don't give any sort of feel that you are building up something resembling a civilization. The game feels very mechanical, based on matching colors/symbols in some abstract way that seems to have nothing to do with actual card text and powers. The cards that hurt other players are extremely powerful and can end someones game.

RATING: 4
Unimpressed by most of this game. The clever bits are how many different ways a card can be used in the game. The rest was a not very fun game in my opinion. 

There is far too much text on the cards and it would take a lot of plays to really learn the deck and be prepared for what may come. Therefore in my first game virtually any chance at strategy was gone. It felt like a game that plays itself a bit in terms of I only had so many cards and had to make use of what I got--I rarely felt like I was controlling the action and instead was just doing what the game laid out for me. 

Finally many of the effects seem far too chaotic and I only won in the end it seemed since I got some scoring cards that I was able to keep abusing and my opponents couldn't get any. I didn't really see where I had played better and instead it seemed I simply had lucked into a good combo with scoring cards. 

In the end, I would play again but very reluctantly. This isn't my type of game.

This is a 2p-only game for me, and it maybe probably ranks as my favorite game. My neighbor and I play it nearly every time we get together to play cards, and we can play a game in about 30 minutes. 

One of my favorite features of any game is "on your turn, you may take two actions. These are the four actions; mix and match however you want." Boom, done. I'm really not big on Action Selection Restrictions (worker placement, roll dice to dictate actions, use a mancala to govern your actions, etc), and prefer more open games. I also like games where you can move backwards in order to move forwards, and that's a little harder to explain; there aren't many examples of those, but let me try and explain with Innovation. 

I love how I can pillage my own score pile, or blow up my tableau, or cover up a strong card to make a stronger play later, or lean on an action that puts me ahead in one area but buries me in another. I like that basically every card is broken, too. I know this game incites strong feelings, but this is one that has absolutely settled down the more I have played it. It doesn't feel nearly as uncontrollable as when I first started playing it. It makes me relax. Did my scorepile disappear in three turns. Not a problem. Relax. You've seen this before. Are you behind 4-1 on Achievements? Not a problem. Let's see if we can't get into the 8s soon. 

Even after close to 50 plays, we still see things each game we've never seen before, and we still chuckle as we discover new jokes about the theme of each card.

Given how "LOLRANDOM" this game can end up, I'm kind of surprised I like it as much as I do. I guess there was a point where the onboard complexity got to absurd levels (keeping track of 5 abilities each for 3-4 players, plus thinking about what cards were in the stacks other than the top one gets real overwhelming real fast), and I stopped caring about what people were doing other than me.

The game kind of falls apart once someone starts drawing age 9 or 10 cards, since those ones basically force the end of the game whether you like it or not. I pulled off a chain reaction of a bunch of ability triggers one time, and it ended up with me accidentally winning the game because I happened to have more of a symbol on the board than anyone else. I was forever immortalized in my group for "accidentally masturbating to victory".

Use something, anything, in a race through civilizations finest moments and don't cry when your cool tricks get taken from you; instead, jump on the next thing and hope for the best. Initially I was concerned that the game would be too chaotic and unrewarding, but instead this has a lot of elements I originally liked in Magic the Gathering, and the four player team game I quite like and is what I imagine a postmodern version of Bridge or some traditional team card game would be like.

Innovation is a tricky game to rate.  It's become one of my favourite card games, alongside Race for The Galaxy and Dominion, yet I can't give it a 10 or even a 9.

The reason is that the game experience can be pretty variable.  Some games are very chaotic; others play out in a much more orderly - and tactical - fashion.  Sometimes there will be a runaway leader; other times, a long, drawn out slugging match.  Some players love the game, others actively hate it.

My view is that the experience can also depend to a large extent on the number of players; with two, the game is much tighter, requires a closer eye on what you can do and what your opponent is up to; add in two more players and the chaos is on a par with Fluxx - I still enjoy the game, but it's hard to argue with those that don't once we're at that level of luck versus skill.  My view is that three players is where the sweet spot lies.

One criticism that you could never make of the game is that it's not varied; every game seems to play out differently, a card that was all-powerful in one game is all but useless the next, a strategy might work with one set of cards and utterly fail with another.  And it's probably this level of variety that has kept my interest in the game.

The upside:
-Some potential to explore card sinergies. A lot of different cards is not as interesting as different ways to make them interact to your benefit. Although, you're not relating powers with each other, but powers with symbols on your cards.
-Nice sense of evolution, as the powers of the cards keep getting powerful (and crazier), as the ages go by.

The downside:
-Chaotic as hell.
-I think there's a severe runaway leader problem here. You spend VPs for claiming achievements, but you keep those VPs...

Only played twice but they were both really fun experiences. Even though it tends to be very chaotic and tactical (2 things I tend to despise) it was very enjoyable. More plays will let me know how much staying power it has. 

-May 2012

33 games played so far. 

Hands down this is the best game I have played since I was introduce to Dominion in 2010. Of all the games I have played since getting into this hobby nothing came close to creating the replay ability, thrill, and intrigue that Dominion had, until now. 

Every game feels like a new discovery and there is always a sense that that there is more to learn. Whenever I lose, the desire to improve becomes even stronger. 

~July, 9th 2012

Tied for best game ever with Through the Ages. 
Action Selection, Tactical, Tableau Building, and incredible variety are just a few of the things that I like about it. 
People complain that it is too luck driven but skill is a much bigger factor than luck.

Only one game, so difficult to rate and comment (especially as my first two turns were a blank and I never could catch up) but it's another Chuck D clever if every so slightly overwrought card game. Perhaps a little too long, but repeat plays would make the card effects stand out.

It can be overwhelming the first few games and that sense of discovery and never QUITE being comfortable with your position is what makes this game in my opinion.

It seems initially bewildering given the range of options on a turn but the core mechanics are surprisingly simple and streamlined. Can get extremely chaotic and, once again, this is another game that I prefer as a two-player head to head. A lot of game in a small box.

RATING: 10
Clever, wonderful tableau building card game. From the very creative mind of Carl Chudyk (of Glory to Rome fame, another excellent card game). Theme is there if you are looking for it, but what separates it from the pack is the unique game play and unpredictable outcomes (though you always feel in control). My advise to the uninitiated is this: "Don't give up! There is always a way (or a card) to help you get back up and turn the tables around." Can't recommend it enough. Only complaint is that it is quite text heavy - which might put off some non-native English gamers.

RATING: 8
I like that each card is different and unique.  I can imagine that with more plays and knowledge of the deck there would be considerable groaning amongst the players that such and such a player got a particular card.

If I were to rank Innovation in a hierarchy with Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome, I would say that Race > Innovation > Glory to Rome.  Both Innovation and Glory to Rome are slower than Race for the Galaxy because there are so many things to consider.  The only time there are a ton of considerations to make in Race is when you've got a full hand of cards.  It can be time consuming to decide the implications of spending each one.  In Innovation, so far, I've found it to be rare to have a hand of more than four cards.  This means that the decisions you have to make come from what's already on the table rather than what is in your hand.  I prefer the decision tree of possible decisions (from the cards in your hand) rather than the decision of which power you've already got to activate.   I find the potential of cards in hand much more interesting.

Additionally, Innovation frequently causes players to have no cards in hand, so if the players have no powers that they'd like to use on the table, they can pretty much draw one and play one.  It leaves me with a feeling of simplicity.  My only decision is to figure out if the random card I've just drawn is good enough or should I just try for random luck again.  I'm someone who enjoys Fluxx, so I don't always mind this sort of mindless non-decision making.  That being said, the most experience player won every game that I've played so far, so I know the game is certainly more than dumb luck.

12/12/11 Picked up the other day and played a 2 player game with my wife.  First impression was very favorable.  Had to "learn the lingo" in the rulebook, but after going over it twice we were good to go.  Also downloaded the "teaching guide" doc here on BGG - helped a lot.  Always a plus when you can start relatively quickly without too much rules memorization.

I like the mechanic of "splaying" in the fact that it allows a stack of cards to vary in power level.  I also like that it plays relatively quickly (took us about an hour for our first game).  There were a few rules questions that came up but I believe I was able to answer them correctly by using the FAQ on this site.

I am a little concerned how this will play with more than 2 players - as it seems a lot can happen in a short period of time between turns (even in a two player game).  I am hoping things won't get too chaotic with extra players.

I want to love this game, I do, really. But, for me, there are a few issues. First is the "Take that!" way the game plays out, swinging backwards and forwards (or sometimes in only one direction). Secondly this is not a game for a casual player - I think knowing the cards and what comes up in each deck would be a huge advantage.

There's a good game here, but the threshold you'd have to climb to find it is too steep for me.

When we bought this at a board game store, the owner told us we'd hate it the first time we played, but then it would get better.  We love it!  Since every card is different, the game plays differently every time.  There are multiple strategies and you have to tailor yours depending on the cards you get.  Of course it's confusing the first time, but if you stick with it, it's tons of fun!

An almost perfect two-player experience. A good mix of strategy and luck, interaction and solitaire. Some cards are way too powerful, but there are plenty of ways to combat this -- I just haven't been able to do it. Three player felt more chaotic and not quite as fun. After ten or so plays, this has settled into an 8.5. One of our favorites. 

Update (7/20/14): This game has lasting power, and may be our favorite. A solid 9.

Seems extremely luck-driven, which wouldn't bother me in a shorter game - but the one game I've played (4 players, 3 of them playing for the first time) took nearly two hours. However, I recognize that a learning game requires everyone to read every card.

I like it better than Glory to Rome, for sure. I would play again as long as that playing time goes down.

UPDATE: Liked it better as a two-player game. Happy to play on occasion, but doubt I'd ever buy it.

RATING: 8.5
Innovation is a very unique card game which resolves around very simple basic actions(play a card, activate a card, draw a card or dominate). As the game progresses each player has to deal with constantly changing situations and more complex structures that force the players to react to everything that happens on the table. Strategy comes from the fact that each player should know how they are going to win the game and how they are not going win the game. This requires players to ditch their previous approach and a create new strategy. Innovation is also very tactical game. Reacting to your opponents' moves is crucial part of the game. 

The gameplay has a narrative feel and each game tells you a different story even though the game is based on a very abstract system, the theme still manages to arise on top and playing the game has a highly thematic feel. 

Innovation is still a very polarizing game; I think most people will either hate or love Innovation and I think "the middle ground" between the fans and the people who hate this game is very narrow. The game has its swings and luck is part of the game but better player will most likely succeed. Definitely best as a 2-player game, works as a 3-player game to some degree but it's already pushing the limits. Don't play this game with four players! Overall, Innovation is a very good 2-player card game that I'm happy to have in my collection.

20+ games in, and every game has played out differently. And almost every game has seen a tight finish. Yeah, it's a 10.

=======================================================

Updated rating after five plays. I'm starting to appreciate the dynamic push and pull of icons versus dogmas, scoring versus tech level. You really have to be flexible, pressing your advantage when you can, while setting up for long-term plays. The variability and breadth of play are astonishing.

======================================================

First game was a head-scratcher, but by the second we were cheerfully pulling levers and setting up combos. Lots to process at the table, and I wouldn't play it with more than three. But we all enjoyed the way the dogmas ramped up in effect, and the difficult choices between building your icon strength, playing dogmas, and scoring achievements.

And this is no dry exercise in solo engine-building. The interaction in Innovation is intense; sometimes brutual and sometimes extremely subtle.

Looks to be serious depth and replayability here. I could easily see the rating on this game rising if I play it frequently with experienced players.

RATING: 7.5
One play only (4 players).  The rules are simple enough but obviously we didn't really know what we were doing strategy wise.  Very swingy (for us anyway), quite nasty and just a little bit weird (more than once someone wondered what on earth must be going through the mind of the designer to come up with something like this).  

That said, everyone recognised how clever the mechanics are and how much there is to explore within the game so all are keen to give it another go - preferably with 3 as per the BGG recommendation.        

Oct 14 - after 4 plays at all players counts this has really grown on me. Can see it will get a lot more plays as it has become a favourite of someone in our gaming group.

This felt like the slightly deeper game that 7 Wonders wanted to be but of course it had not tried to cram the game into a thirty minute playing experience. 
In Innovation players develop a Civilization and manipulate cards in various ways to try and achieve one of a several different victory conditions. It is sometimes chaotic, often vicious and certainly challenging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Among my favourite card games - probably only Dominion and Race for the Galaxy come ahead of it. What is brilliant about Innovation is that every single card can seem game-breakingly powerful in any individual game, but that that this applies to a different card in every game! I do think it suffers with more than 2 players - not so much because of the often-complained-about chaos factor (although this does apply more with more players), but more because the piles empty quicker so that everyone tends to advance through the ages at the same, fairly quick, rate. In 2-player games I find that it is a legitimate strategy - indeed, one of my favourites - to aim to advance through the ages quicker than your opponent and then either win with a late-game card or switch to scoring and achieving when you have a good "engine" for doing so. In 3 or 4-player, everyone else advances quickly anyway, so your best chance is just to score and achieve quicker than everyone else - this makes the game more luck-dependent, as you may not get the cards you need to do this.

With 2, though, this is one of the most replayable and most intriguing card games out there. Despite having only 2 actions each turn, the number of options you have is staggering (even more so if you are playing with one or both of the expansions). For a while my wife (who is the only person I can play 2p games against with any regularity) didn't like the game so much and didn't play it with me, but at around Christmas time in 2014 she suddenly got back into it - she actually bought me both expansions for Christmas, and since then we have had plenty of games with Echoes of the Past and a few with Figures as well. (I lose horribly almost every time, as is not uncommon when I game with her...)

RATING: 6
Innovation is a clever card game where the cards played in front of you represent technological advances that give you advantages in some respects. You can invoke the power of a technology (dogma) and the player with the most of the representative symbol takes advantage of said power benefiting himself or directly impacting other players. 

You really need to know all the cards well and which pair well together. I find it difficult to plan a long term strategy and often the more tactical player, not stuck on any one path will be successful. I'm always building a big infrastructure with grandiose plans while others are scoring and pushing the game to end quickly. Also, the higher player count, the more chaotic the game is. Quite good for 2-players though.

Eines der besten und mit Bezug auf seine Mechanismen "innovativsten" Kartenspiele der letzten Jahre. zunächst erscheint das Spiel unthematisch, will sagen: Man sieht nicht ganz, wieso das spielerische Tun dem Aufbau einer Zivilisation dienlich sein soll.

The Iello edition is beautiful.  The boards are excellent quality and the artwork far superior to what I've seen of Asmadi.

In terms of play, only one two player game so far which took around 1.5 hours.  Will surely get much quicker once more used to which cards will come up in each period and the relative merits of archiving, splaying etc.  At the moment, it occupies a tidy place in my collection in being more than just a filler.  Can't wait to give it a couple more goes and see how it develops.

UPDATE:  It has become quicker - still trying to get my head around wanting to take advantage of horribly broken combos.  It just doesn't seem fair.  Last two games were particularly brutal to me but in a good way.

(+) Variety abounds in this game, between the cards and combinations and various technological eras.  
(+) High player interaction, by virtue of the requirement of paying close attention to card symbols in play.  
(+) Excellent story arc, better than a most games. A clear ramping up of pace is fueled by 'innovation', and frankly, it's quite fun.  

(-) Not ideal for more than two players, certainly not 4. The AP can be staggering or else the play can stagnate while players track symbols.  
(-) The game can "break" and one player can gain a substantial lead as a result. Chaos is really the name of the game, and that will turn off a key demographic of gamers (and attract another).
(-) Graphic design is not particularly pretty but functional.

The first plays can be a bit slow as people try to figure out the various cards.  But as one gets deeper into the deck, the more powerful cards emerge and players can suddenly catch up.  The one caveat I have with the game - the few times I have won, I don't know what I did to do so other than take advantage of the cards I had drawn.  Just can't shake a feeling that "luck of the draw" will always be a part of any game.

Rating can't really stay here...it'll either go up (if a less random, less runaway-leader game emerges) or go very far down if it turns out that that's really all there is to it.

The graphics don't bother me so much, or even the text.  But the strong linking between score and Achievements seems effed to me.  Gain score and you're in great shape to win by either Achievements or endgame score.  Fall behind in score and lose.  Feel free to substitute the words "tech," or "symbols" for "score" in the previous sentence.

It'll get a few more plays (six so far), but it's on a VERY short leash.

After 1 4-player game, it seems like chaotic fun with nicely clear elegant rules (I like that) and tons of special actions on every card (I'm less fond of that). A more complex "serious" Fluxx? I'll have to play more to decide whether I think it has staying power or not.

2011-08-08: 3 more games (4, 2, and 3-player) in Miodosytnia, and it still reminds me of a more complex Fluxx. Fun, but really big luck swings can happen!

Played with 2 and 3 players. Very hard to see  what both you and your opponents really can do each turn.

Played this at Gamefest South 3 and I think this may be the biggest surprise. One of the guys I played with I saw playing on 2 or 3 other occasions, so he obviously fell in love with it. I don't blame him.

The game is a civilization game unlike anything I've ever heard before. Hell, it's unlike any game I've ever seen or heard of. The terminology in the game is something to be desired. The words are typical English, so when you're told to "splay" you have no earthly clue what the hell that means. But once you get to playing the game, the rules are so simple.

I really really look forward to playing this again. It's a short game, there's a lot of player interaction, and it's only about 100 cards.

Amazing fun.  I think this will be better than Glory to Rome.  Decisions are difficult due to the ripple effects of opponents leaching actions.

Just a fantastic gaming experience.

I  can't say enough good things about Innovation. Having played the 2 player version a couple dozen times, I've seen the game play out in a variety of ways. In my last play, I started out with a strong lead of 3 achievements. I then made some mistakes, and my opponent blew by me with 5 consecutive achievements before I could get one more. He ended up in the 10 deck while I was mulling around in the 5-6.  An amazing occurrence happened that forced him to draw and meld a card from the 10 deck, it just so happened that the card he melded yielded me the victory. 

There is a staggering amount of depth and variability hidden within, and I'm still being surprised by the game after 25+ plays. It's highly tactical, and knowledge if the cards helps a lot. The learning curve is pretty steep. In fact, I outright disliked Innovation after my first couple plays. After a while, I started thinking about my previous plays, and all the ways I could improve upon my strategy. I took a leap, purchased the game, and the rest is history. Innovation is probably the only game where my opinion went from intense dislike to avid appreciation. Makes me wonder what other gem are out there that I wrote off too quickly.

--May2010-- Lovely chaotic mini-civ cardgame.  Not at all like _Through the Ages_; this is much faster and less fiddly, though it has distinctly less of an epic feel.  It's possible that the theme is entirely too secondary - perhaps as it can be in Campaign Manager 2008:  it's too easy to talk about Clocks and Crowns (here) or Red and Blue markers (there) rather than enjoying the thematic associations.
--Jul2017-- Sadly, perhaps, that secondary nature of the theme triumphs:  I've not played now for years, after increasingly finding the game a rather uncompelling accretion of meaningless icons.  I know folk that find this delightful; but I'm not one of them, nor do I regularly play with anyone of that opinion.

The civilization theme always boosts my interest. This one is a fast-pace card games, where you lead your civilization through the stone age to the future time. There are six major icons in the game, each with different influence or power, and players will likely compete with 4 or 5 of them. It's not hard to deduce that in the early game castle prevails over others, as in the late game clocks do. While in the middle, you just repeatedly trigger the highest card you have, and thus save your action and lead you to victory.

Initially this game totally fulfilled my expectations. It's usually chaotic, there's quite a few swings, there's quite a bit of direct interaction, it's tactical over strategic etc. At first I even though the theme worked. And the art... It seems to me the general sentiment is that the Asmadi version is ugly, but far from it. It just emphasises clarity, a necessity for this game. The iello version changes the terminology so that it's more confusing, not less, and the icons are harder to identify requiring you to lean over to see them instead of just glimpsing across the table. Definitely recommend the Asmadi version.

Overall it's simple to explain but your first play will take considerably longer than the estimated playing time. The complexity is in the card abilities and how they mesh. I love how even Age 1 cards can be just the best thing to have on top in the later ages. The potential swings sort of quarantee you're never out, but sometimes it's just impossible to make them happen. Rating has gone down from 9 to 8 because the game's all mechanics and it's a little too hard to fight against bad card draws a little too often. I wouldn't mind getting screwed by luck were there something else to enjoy in the game, like a developing story or character or battles between others.

2014: I came back to this and the rating went back up to 9 after a game where I won on special achievements as the underdog. I guess we've learned to fight bad card draw.

Bizarrely, this, of all the games we have has been one of my wife's favorites.  I realized it's great too (it just took me longer to get there), but, if ever there were a fine wine of games its Innovation and it's expansions.  The first game feels Fluxxy and you may never return to it.  Then you realize meh, it wasn't quite as bad as Fluxx, maybe there's more to it...  Suffice it to say the more you play the more game you discover and the more you learn how to navigate the rough waters that you will encounter.  It's brilliant in many respects, but it's also crazy and unique...maybe that's part of it's brilliance.

this game was brutal,  maybe because  it was late, and maybe because we were relatively new to the game, or maybe because we were drinking scotch.

The fact that every card plays so different, it took us forever to get through a game.  there were numerous pauses while we figured out exactly what the cards did.  This game may be better once you learn what every card does, but this game left such a bad taste in my mouth that I don't think I will ever spend the time to learn them all.

One and done for me.

No use denying it any longer, Innovation is brilliant. It is the most nuanced, dramatic, and varied card game that I have played in a long time. It's a potent mix of tactical decisions and barely contained chaos, and that's something that we haven't yet seen in the realm of serious non-collectible card games. This is the best game of 2010, and it may well have the legs to go beyond.

RATING: 2
A dense mess of icons and wordy powers in tiny fonts.  The game is utterly inaccessible, with an overwhelmingly-complex board state dependent on the text of five cards you have out, five cards your opponent has out, the icons on all of them, and the cards you could play from your hand to change that.  The theme is pasted on with the flimsiest of brushes, and all the powers are opaque rather than intuitive.  If you memorized all the cards, you could get somewhere, but my play left with me no desire to ever do so, given that there's games I actually enjoy out there.

Nice as a two-player game - a very nice flow. I like the fact that you can feel the game accelerating towards an end, and your choices are either abort the sequence with an achievement win, or push to the end to try and pull a card power based win.

Very tactical, but not very strategic - the game is all about making the best of where you are, and not planning on where you need to be in any meaningful sense. However, in spite of this, definately worth a playthrough.

Visual Appeal: (3)
The box design is pretty spartan. Not a problem for me because all it has to do is hold those precious cards! Some people might have a problem with the cards' appearance but I think they are just right. Typical of Chudyk games, they show a lot of information efficiently in a small space. As the game progresses with splaying tableaux, it is an aesthetically pleasing card game to look at.

Components: (4)
The cards are of decent quality. Each expansion has a different color back and the print quality has been consistent throughout. I have been unable to sleeve them because the backs need to be visible and I hate penny sleeves. Luckily the cards are holding up great even after many dozens of plays. [I look forward to grabbing the deluxe edition when it finally becomes available!]

Theme: (5)
I know many people will disagree, but I happen to think that this game incorporates theme in a clever way! There's an almost tongue-in-cheek abstraction of the "innovation" that each card represents. My favorite example is the Pirate Code card which allows you to "pillage" an opponent's board and "loot" their score pile. Although it states the action in more dry mechanical terms, I think the flavor is still in there. Not every card has a clear connection to the title, but if you stretch the imagination I think you can make it work. I always have a giggle when I think of a new one. 

Learning: (3)
This game takes 10-15 minutes to teach, and the rest is picked up during play. It can be frustrating to play against a more experienced player because knowledge of the cards is key. Learning Innovation is an ongoing task for me as I've reached the point where I want to learn strategies to counter specific cards. 

Gameplay: (5)
There are some really great screw you cards in this game. I play mostly with 2 players. Once you know what to look for, it can be a real battle of wits to keep your symbols in perfect position to attack, defend, and advance in the right balance. Stealing points from your opponents feels so satisfying. Races for the achievements can get very close and there is a lot of tension surrounding who can get the first 3 the fastest. The game in terms of card abilities is very tactical: what dogma ability would really help me right now? In terms of building a board and splaying for symbols, the strategic element of the game begins to show itself.

Overall Fun: (5)
I have played this game many many times with all of the released expansions and it just does not wear out for me. I like figuring out new card combinations to add to my arsenal of tricks, and the player interactions are a good match for what I want in a 2 player game. 3+ player games can run a little slow and that was the main complaint that I heard when I played with a larger group of friends. "Isn't this a bit long for a card game?" I suppose that is true. Currently my favorite 2p game and I'm not itching to dethrone it anytime soon.

Some good ideas but lacking the flexibility and tension of Glory to Rome. This is an engine building game without a catchup mechanism, since the best engines will steal elements from the weaker ones. Components are crappy but serviceable.

Update: Played some more and enjoyed it a bit more, but still not sure about the whole thing. It does seem like an overly baroque take-that game at its core, though there is clearly a fair bit of tactical decision making. Hmmm. Merits further study.

One of my favorites games. This one has gotten a ton of play, to the point where it's impossible for us to play the base game anymore and need the expansion. Otherwise we tend to break the game and finish it in 10-15 minutes. Best as a two-player game, can get too chaotic with 3-4.

Pure chaos. It's quite fun to see 'broken' combos turning up in the game, even if you are badly beaten with no fault of yours. However, a single card can turn the tides and make a winner from the loser. It's impossible to plan anything.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played at the end of a long day's gaming, with head a bit frazzled. Unsurprisingly given the circumstances, it didn't quite click. I can definitely see that improving with repeat plays. I completely misunderstood 'splaying' until long into the game, so need definitely need another shot at it. The play experience combines Glory to Rome with Wallace's London. Choices didn't feel at all intuitive, which isn't typical for 'civ' games, but again, this may well be owing to brain-fried-ness and unfamiliarity. Still, it seems you have to know the cards, and there a lot of cards to know. I don't think the same is entirely true with GTR, as that seems to me easier to see what is going on, and overall more funner. But first impressions can change, will see how I feel if I ever try it again. 

Sept 2015 Edit: Well worth persevering with. Now I have picked up a copy, am getting a lot of play of this with the missus. At first she was outraged by the various 'wrecking' powers, but that only increased willingness to give it another try. Has taken over 2p slot for us - for how long?

At first it was a little bit chaotic and mean for my taste, but as you get to know the game you'll become more aware of the havoc certain cards can wreak and you'll prepare for that.

There's a lot going on and it's certainly never boring. Even when you're not doing too well it seems the tide can turn and you might strike a powerful combination that can bring you back in it.

A really good little card game that will need and reward further play. Indeed, as someone who likes variety, I certainly feel this game has good replayability. It's my game of choice at the moment to take on a ski trip with limited luggage space/weight available.

The new Asmadi Third Edition comes in a very portable box and is always going to be the first game packed in the jacket pocket. Excellent new edition.

Fast playing game from the designer of Glory to Rome and Organic Soup - a civ game that doesn't take 4 hours -  it is played with cards.  

As the card values increase the game actually tightens up as those who are behind can catch up and get right back into the game in a play or two.

It was a nice filler as we waited for the rest of the group to arrive.

edit:  I've played this three times now - the latest with the newly released "official" version.  There's been a bit of card tweaking and the game plays even better now.

Innovation is all about trying to abuse card powers. It plays relatively quickly, has a decent amount of randomness, and a decent amount of strategy. The game is chaotic, but you can learn to manage that chaos better, and the chaos adds to the variability in the game. My main issue with Innovation is that if you don't play pretty regularly, you'll forgot most of the cards, which limits how much you can play strategically.

Innovation is much more chaotic with 4, so many players will prefer it as a 2, maybe 3 player game.

A great game. Would be a higher rating if I didn't have to continuously read the cards upside-down and ask for refreshers of what the cards mean. I guess it would be better if I had the cards memorized, but I don't play this game enough to do that. 

Regardless, it is short and full of strategy. The sudden endings lead to variable playing time, which is really fun. If it goes to long, it gets more chaotic. This end game chaos leads to pressure to get the game finished in early rounds. 

It's not a perfect game, by any means, but the time and randomness (but not too random!) cause this game to be light enough to hit the table regularly without taking up the whole evening. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is high in randomness, but as a two-player, it's quite controlled. You're not going to just win or lose if you get the "right" cards; knowing how to deal with certain combinations is important and is something only skilled players will be capable of.

With three or four players, the luck element becomes much more important, and the cards you draw will have a much stronger effect. It's harder to build a working engine when you have access to a smaller proportion of the cards, so the more players the game has, the swingier it will be.

(Rating: 4) The learning curve for this game feels like a cliff. I think like I might like the game if I already knew it very well, but I won't enjoy flailing randomly for 20 games until I have all the cards memorized, which is what it feels like is necessary to even start using real strategy.

Update several years later: I got over the cliff and it's glorious up here.

This game is based around a very simple concept: splaying. The idea is that when cards are stacked in a pile, you can lay them out to reveal parts of the cards below them. Since cards have one icon on the right side of the card, two on the left, and three on the bottom, splayed card piles progress naturally: left to right to up.

Fortunately obtaining icons doesn't win you the game on its own (unless you happen to get cards that say stuff like "win the game if you have twenty lightbulb icons".) This is great because the game doesn't milk this one mechanic too heavily. Instead, you are focusing on obtaining individual cards - some with powerful actions for advancing your board and others which increase your score. This means you need to continually balance your board to try to accomplish many things at once.

I used to have this game at an 8 because I felt it was unbalanced and just amounted to crazy fun - a fully realized Fluxx, basically. However (in part due to Isotropic play), I've realized that this game is only as good as your opponents. Once you get fifty games under your belt, you begin to see that, well, this game has it all. Nothing beats this for me. It is strategic, it is tense, it is a fight-for-your-life game. It hits me harder than Dominion because it operates at such a quick pace. This game hits my adrenaline. What kind of game does that?

Carl Chudyk did well with Glory to Rome, but it has a precedent in other role selection games (RftG, San Juan, etc.) However, Innovation is truly unique. Nothing feels like it.

Lastly, the interaction in this game is unbelievable. You are fighting over cards in hand. You steal from each other's boards and score piles. You demand and share and race. And it's not the back-stabbing, subterfuge sort of interaction. It is a battle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dominate a majority of the 10 ages. Tried and true 2 actions per turn, used to draw, play, score (dominate), or very often in the mid-game and after, activate the cards you already have on the table. Activating is beneficial when you have more of the right resources on the table, to either be able to activate an attack or to prevent leeching, though sometimes you do want to let your opponent leech if it doesn't help as much (plus you get a card out of it) or actually hurts him. Visual aplomb is achieved by splaying cards in different directions to achieve cumulative effect of all card icons in a color stack.

Race for influence and ensure you have the spare actions to stake your dominance (else your opponent might). Wasting an action to score is a nice catch-up mechanism, similar to that in Twilight Struggle.

Very CCG-like in terms of keeping all the abilities on the table straight in your head.

Surprisingly thematic, despite needing to game some abilities (I draw after you with this ability, so I get a better card, yay). Splaying in each direction appears to have a concept attached to it. And lots of nicely implemented ideas like Statistics (hah!) and Coal result in drastic externalities on your civilization when you throttle them, providing a nice commentary on over-use.

Completes the Chudyk combo: Innovation for 2er, Glory to Rome for higher player counts. Playing with more than 2 would result in too much chaos and bean-counting. I don't like that you really need to memorize the cards in each Age in order to do well though (like 7 Wonders).

It's a solid game that had me ready to play again and that is ALWAYS a good sign.

Still stumbling through the jungle. It's game of chaotic effects and huge swings, but that's probably just initial impression (every card in the deck is unique). It's about majorities (of symbols) and building them. It's probably also about knowing what's in the deck and trying to ride this ocean of chaotic streams and interlocking waves. Playing with two different groups I came to conclusions:
- won't play with 4 again
- needs players playing aggressively, trying to stay in control (focusing on your own play can just make you into a victim) - this went well with our core group and it will  be played again. 
- need to play more. 

EDIT: 
They all say I need to play it with 2 players (which is something I do very rarely) to really get it. So far I'm not impressed. Mostly because I don't agree it's as creative as people say - it's totally card driven for crissake! So sorry, but this lacks emerging qualities.

Played once with 3P. Although there are a few superficial similarities to Glory to Rome, Innovation is quite a different beast altogether. For starters, almost nothing in Innovation is safe – Influence can be stolen and inventions destroyed. Granted, there are a few strategic decisions such as deciding whether to splay your cards, but Innovation is very much a tactical game where one has to observe what one's opponents are doing. 

This probably means that Innovation plays better with fewer people as the chaos can be reined in a little, and there are fewer icons to keep track of. My first game took a little long as there is plenty of text to read, and conditions of the game can change quite abruptly, although I think familiarity with the cards would allow players to better anticipate the kind of hijinks which can ensue.

Clever, unique, and fun. It's a great game if you have exactly 3 players, though it can lag a bit for some people as they try and work through all their possible card powers. I've since decided that it's also great with 4 as long as you play with the partnership rules.

[3 plays] It plays like a mix of San Juan, Fluxx, and a civ building game. I mean that description not entirely as a bad thing, but the Fluxx portion of the pie chart is large. Although there are fun and clever opportunities within the card play, there is too much chaos here for this to be taken too seriously as a strategic game.

Rules make this seem harder than it really is. Can be learned quite effectively with a decent rule explanation and then jumping right in. I am mildly interested to try this with 2 players, but not very eager to play anymore multiplayer.

This is a fantastic, innovative, and unique card-based civilization-building game; I don't ever seem to get tired of playing this game and introduce others to it whenever possible. I love the interaction, dynamic play, and variable win conditions.  This is one of my favorite games.

I prefer either playing the base game on it's own or Innovation + Innovation: Echoes of the Past + Innovation: Figures in the Sand.  I do not care for just the base game and first expansion (Innovation + Innovation: Echoes of the Past).

RATING: 1
It's ok with two, but with 3 or more there's too much down time. 4-player with teams seems ok, sort of? 

Even though in principle I sort of understand how I should be playing, I don't ever feel in control anything while I'm actually playing. I have read theory's site on the cards and how I'm supposed to be mitigating luck (a skill that is important in a lot of games we own/play), but I have never been able to get any of it to work in practice. The result is that it all feels very luck-prone. 

The other thing that is super annoying is the huge amounts of tracking. There are all these stupid little icons that you need to know the count of at any given moment, but these change pretty much every turn. And every time another card comes down, we have to ask each other to read the whole damn thing out (which, of course, can take a while with some of the later cards). 

So, yeah. This game has two of my biggest pet peeves in games: excessive token tracking and loads of text. This and Zombicide are what made me change my approach to finding games I thought I might like.

Completely unexpected, odd, bizarre, nerve-wrecking, hair-greying bit of a brilliance.

RATING: 9
Like my girlfriend says, this game is "Jazzy." Possible that it becomes more static at an expert level, but as far as I can tell this game encompasses improvisation better than any game out there.

Definitely best with 2 players, for many reasons, but most of all that most of the beauty in this game comes from dancing and maneuvering around an opponent, matching him on some icons and exploiting him on others. Slowing or speeding up the tempo based on who has the momentum. Having even one more opponent would make that pretty much impossible.

The cards somehow seem very balanced and well thought out... despite seeming extrmely broken. You just have to stand back in awe at the design. So brilliant. And when you realize that the cards actually have thematic connotations as well? This is just an amazing game through and through. I enjoy it a lot, but I think I admire it even more than I enjoy it.

Also, a quick read through of the short rulebook will leave you assuming that this game is gonna have some serious runaway leader problems, but it [i]doesn't[/i]. Somehow, the most killer combos become outdated and archaic. Again, this has to be the most subtly thematic game out there. Probably one of the top 5 games I've ever played, from a "design" standpoint.

I've come up with a shorter variant of the game that captures gameplay in its essence.  

In a three player game, randomly deal out a 10 card, an 8 card and a 4 card.  The person with the 4 card gets to trade for the 10 card and wins. The old 10 card guy comes in last even though he had the high number because ultimately he drew the wrong card and someone else drew the right one.

In a four player game, randomly deal out a 10 card, an 8 card, a 4 card and a 1 card. The person with the 8 card gets to trade with the 10 to win, the 4 keeps their card it's useless, and all three take the 1 card away from the last player so that he can't actually play.

The only thing keeping this fFrom being a rating of 10 fFor me is that sometimes the game seems to run long, and it sometimes has the impression of strategy when it's more like chaos.

Simply love it. Great two player game. I don't recommend it 4 player as it's just too chaotic with that many. It's a tableau laying game where the tableaus can get up and bite, hard. My wife and I play it often, and when we do it's a vicious struggle for dominance. First one of us, then the other, will find some way to us a card to do nastiness. Some people claim some cards are too powerful but it's really situational. A card that works great in one game might be a dud in the next.

The rules are badly written but once you understand them you never need to go back and reread (it's really a simple game, the gameplay is all in the cards).

Innovation is certainly a creative game.  I really like the different things you can do with your cards.  It does help to have a strong knowledge of all the cards and what they can do, though.  I also can see why it has its detractors -- it's not easy to have things taken away just because someone happened to draw a certain card.  Poor Sam had to suffer through two games of getting owned and poor card draws.  If I had that kind of game I might look differently on it, but for now, I'd certainly play it again and enjoyed the first two plays enough.

RATING: 9
An absolute blast - one of those games that I knew i loved almost as soon as I started playing it. Now, I prefer this as a two player game, I think its still awesome with three, but that's as far as ill go. The 4 player goes on way to long for what it is, in my opinion. 

Great mechanic involving getting your symbol empire built up so no one else can jack you - this is really the heart of the game. But, the cards are so varied and you can do so many different things - it is really a delight to have all those choices. 

I don't generally like "take that" mechanics in games, especially when they are just something the designer threw in to combat a perceived "multiplayer solitaire" problem. This game has A LOT of "take that" but it's so well integrated into the fiber of the game that it makes sense, flows well (usually), and doesn't seem that harsh. 

Just go in knowing that there is chaos and mechanics that are destructive to your tableau, and you will have a really fun time.

Playing online is good in that all the totals of the symbols are automatically set out, rather than playing face-to-face where manual counting has to be done every turn. However, I very much prefer playing face-to-face rather than online.

Understanding the rules really helps for this game, and I have more warmed to it after a long period of coolness. However, I'm still not really a fan of the (manual) counting and recounting of symbols necessary, which distinctively turns me off this game.

 One of the most dynamic games I've played.  I almost said that this is an "engine building game" and I suppose it is - but your engine is constantly changing.  It seems to me (after only 3 plays) that being flexible and changing your approach as the game progresses is critical.  I can see this game having crazy replayability - not only is each  (of the many) cards unique, but the relationship of each card with your tableau, your opponents tableau, and the game state at each moment is different every time.  I can't wait to play this again.  I REALLY like Carl Chudyk.  My only concern is that it appears that once you get behind, it is hard to recover.  Hopefully this is just due to inexperience.

Revised from 8 (Feb 2011) to 7 (2011).

An addictive card game where players aim to get 5 achievements through various means. I think the sweet spot is 3 players. Any more than that and people get bogged down with AP, having to read individual card and count sets of matching icons. Some times, I feel that it's hard to catch up to someone who is clearly in the lead.

RATING: 10
Chaotic at first, Innovation is a card game with lots of interaction, some of it helpful and some of it destructive. If you hope to win, you can't ever ignore what your opponents are doing. Because of this, two players is best. With lots of powerful cards, and even more powerful combos, there are countless routes to victory. At the same time, those routes aren't so unpredictable that planning becomes impossible. Every game is different, so you have to adapt. 

It's hard to overstate the genius of the design. What looks and plays like an abstract card game never stops surprising thematically. Not only do card functions reflect their names, they combo together as you'd expect. For example, one of the best early game combos is The Wheel and Domestication. Another powerful early card, Sailing, remains useful even into later ages. I've used it to transition into Colonialism, which in turn proved useful for several ages before petering out. As you advance through the ages, cards become more destabilizing. Some, like AI, are game-changing. There are Easter eggs everywhere. Finding them is as much fun as winning, and the one often leads to the other.

A civ-themed game, apparently, although that is completely lost in the actual gameplay where you are actually looking more at all the funny little symbols than at the names of the cards. There are 10 decks of cards, arranged from early historic times forwards. Players start with 2 cards in hand, deciding to keep 1 in hand and meld the other. On your turn, you get just 2 actions. These could be to simply draw a card (level equal to highest level top card in your display), play a card (from your hand, on top of matching colored stack in your display -- there are five colors in game), take an achievement (based on cards in your "score" pile; first player to earn 8-n achievements wins), or take an action on one of your top cards. The last -- card actions -- is the most interesting. 

The cards have several symbols on them. Card actions key off these symbols: the "I demand" actions attack people with fewer matching symbols showing. The other actions are taken first by people with the same or higher number showing, then you get to go. Actions do a variety of things, eg add cards to your score pile, attack other players display/hand/score pile, splay cards (up, left or right; results in having more symbols showing, and may help earn achievements), etc. 

Once one player gets behind, though, it seems pretty difficult to catch up. You only draw, at most, two cards (barring special card actions) while others can continue attacking you.

It is still kind of interesting and entertaining watching the game unfold, despite simultaneously feeling that it is all almost completely random and based on the cards you happened to draw. I would probably play it again, but I won't seek it out.

I really like this game.  It's kind of a "gamer's Fluxx" with a constantly changing board of options and abilities yet simple rules with the biggest difference being that the game's end conditions don't change.

I love the theme of improving technology through different ages and the variety of options on the 100+ cards.  Balancing your symbols in order to take advantage of abilities that might help your opponents requires a lot of fun tactical thinking and makes this a very deep game despite reasonably simple rules.  The "splaying" mechanic is a neat and original concept as well.

There is a lot of chaos in this game, you can only be so careful and strategic till an opponent or even you yourself mistakenly bring the whole thing crashing down and you're forced to change direction.  This is something many people may not enjoy.  I love it!

With a chance of someone winning simply because he gets the right card at the right moment I think it is still a decent choice that adds some new aspects to card games (at least for me).

One of the best two player games! Get the Iello version, it helps you fall in love with this AWESOME game. Best with 2, OK with 3, horrible with 4.

I played this mostly as a 2-er game. Both players have equal chances to win (don't give up when you feel like you're losing horribly, and that's how you make a come back)! It's highly tactical & you can say chaotic because there are plenty of "imba" cards in the deck, and one minute you're almost winning, and the next you're almost losing...

The ASAMADI version was just OK for me. I only started loving the game when I got the IELLO version -- as you can see, graphics/looks of the game makes a HUGE difference! :)

Game has a pretty obtuse learning curve. Probably one of those things where people can't expect to do reasonably well until they memorize all the cards. Also, scoring influence seems like something that should be allowed via actions instead of just card effects, which turned out to be a source of frustration.

Fun otherwise. Probably shouldn't play with more than 2.

I need to play this a few more times to really get into this.  Innovation is supposedly a civ-card game, but I don't feel like I am building a civilization.  It is more like, I play a powerful card, and then I do some powerful thing, then my opponent plays a more powerful card and then a seemingly unbeatable combo, but then I play a more powerful card that nerfs his unbeatable combo and then I play a card that says "I win".   Somehow this is fun.  No, really, you need to try it, it is fun I just can't explain why.

What do you do with a problem like Innovation? It has clever and novel mechanics as you manage your board, and it has a number of different viable tactics for play. The race to achieve before your opponents starts tense and only gets worse as the game goes on.

However, there's a few inherent problems that Innovation doesn't quite solve. Each of the 100+ cards has a mountain of text and rules associated with it. The rules are usually simple to understand, but the number of cards combined with how often the table changes means that you often need to read every card on the table before you can make an effective decision. I suspect that doctors may use a game of Innovation as the clinical diagnosis for analysis paralysis.

Innovation also suffers from the sheer randomness of the game. Each card is unique, and you're often drawing randomly from the same pile of cards as your opponents. Unless you're playing a strategy of being the first to a new age to find particular cards, you're at the mercy of what you draw or are forced to play blind in many cases. As such, coherent strategies are impossible for more than 2-3 turns before the state of the board has changed dramatically.

I really enjoy aspects of Innovation and I'll never say no to playing. However, I never feel like I earned my victories or defeats. That's fine in a rules-light game that's more about the experience than the competition (hi Galaxy Trucker!), but a friendly game Innovation is not.

The online version makes reading the cards of your opponents much easier and makes it a better game to play, oddly enough.

I should really start posting these reviews somewhere else.

If you thought Glory to Rome was chaotic, think again and play this. Innovation is another game by Chudyk with some very original ideas and concepts. The rules only serve as a rudimentary base, as the flow of the game is almost completely determined by the cards in front of the players.

That makes the game unpredictably chaotic, but in an entertaining way. It is fun in some way to see which cards appear and how they interact. The game is best not taken too seriously. Just sit back and let the game take you for an interesting ride.

Promising. Have to play it more.

Update - played it a lot in last few weeks (>30 times). First, the game is better with more plays and experienced players. Less chaotic, you can see some really smart moves. Helps to know what cards are available. Still have a lot to reveal. 

However, no more than an 8 cause there are games where you beat or get beaten with only 2 cards. Some card combos are just too crazy. You have to live with it, it's the nature of the game I guess.

RATING: 8
tentative rating with 3 players.  Like many games of this type, it will require a fair few plays before you can be good...and quick...about play.  It requires an awreness of what symbols your opponents have showing (which changes frequently) and what their dogma abilities are.  It's solid though because the game requires emgine building, offensive, and defensive play--all great stuff.  

I'm a little leery of the player-driven chaos factor with 4 players, but perhaps it won't be as bad as I think?  Time scales up with player count due to the fact that you can only partially plan your actions, as the board environment can change pretty radically in one trip around the turn.

VERDICT
I really love this game.  Even if you think your situation is desperate, a come back is always possible.  I welcome the chaos and interaction this game brings, it's all about tactical hand and board (icon) management.  I'm not too hot on the 4 player team variant.

Update [8-21-10]
Rating drops down to a 4. And that's only because I'm in a pretty good mood this morning. It's certainly not a 'bad' game but it's absolutely not for me. My problems with the game are just about the same as everyone else's: too chaotic, too much information on the cards, etc. Although I'm willing to believe it's too chaotic BECAUSE there's too much information on all the cards, and if you're willing to take the time to learn each one you might have more control. On the other hand, how do I control NOT being able to get any #$%* SCORE cards?

--

Rating could go up or down. Ratings are funny that way. First time I played it I sort of liked some of the ideas in the game, but then some "hard-earned" victory points were stolen from me creating what I thought was a rather chaotic swing.  When something like this happens to me in a game, there are two ways to think about it: (1) Hm. This game is SO interesting that I want to try it again to see if I can reign in some of the chaos, or (2) It was fun but I think I'm done.

Currently I'm still feeling (1) and wouldn't mind playing it a few more times to see if there's a game in there I enjoy. I certainly *want* to enjoy it at this point -- and that's a very good sign.

I'm often a bit lukewarm on games of this ilk, where you have to build up a little economy/civ to attack other players, defend yourself and achieve objectives. My criteria for liking or disliking such games probably differs from most other people - I don't mind a bit of randomness or imbalance; what I dislike is needing to know what cards other players have but having trouble remembering or seeing them. For me, Innovation is a big hit: interesting mechanisms, plenty of options, clear iconography, relatively fast play. Very interactive - many of your powers allow other players to benefit or suffer depending on how they've responded to your cards.

I can see why some people really like this game. Very cool mechanics. For our family the game wasn't a good fit though.  You really need to be familiar with the cards and their effects to get the most out of the game.  We spent a lot of time reading our cards, re-reading the cards in front of us, and re-reading the cards in front of each other.  This game rewards repeated plays.  Something like Battleline is a much easier to pick up and play once or twice a month.

Innovation is an obvious decendent of Glory to Rome from the same designer.  The "take that" of GtR is obvious here and also augmented.

The design of the game is solid and I'm pretty impressed at how balanced all the cards seem.  However, I don't like the wild swings of fortune and I really don't like having my stuff stolen and my plans completely altered.  I'll take a bit less "take that" in my games.

RATING: 9
Extraordinarily strategic and diverse card game. The premise is to collect influence from cards across 10 ages (from the First Ages to the Digital Age), with each age increasing in value. This in turn allows a player to dominate an age and victory is secured once a certain number of ages have been dominated depending on player numbers. The brilliance of 'Innovation' is found in the fact that players continually have to adapt to the game around them as cards change the conditions by which influence is accrued. This means that there is no 'engine' that a player has to find and that will work consistently. Due to the volume of cards in the game and the vast variety of combinations, one game differs wildly from the next and this ensures enormous replayability. This is a game that takes repeated plays for a player to become aware of how to approach it in terms of decision making, but together with Carl Chudyk's other great card game 'Glory to Rome', there are no better examples of this style of game that I know of.

I keep being blown away by how complex games can get these days with just a pack of cards (i.e. once you start prescribing patterns for them to be laid out in, and have multiple different card types to be used in different ways). Big difference here also between 2 player and 4 player - totally different strategies. Also pleasantly surprised that more players makes it go faster for once, because more players means accelerating more quickly through the decks into more powerful cards.

RATING: 8
4 plays isn't enough to really judge it but so far I quite like it.
 
I bought this as I wanted a fairly quick 2p game with lots of back and forth like similar to a competetive CCG, to act as a sort of a palette cleanser from all the awesome but staid RftG we play. So far I think it's working it has the potential to hang around for quite a while.

+finding and exploiting combinations keeps you on your toes; knowing that whatever pain you inflicted will be coming back at you soon negates any hard feelings
+good rulebook
+play speed should improve signficantly over time
+feels epic at times as your civilization shifts and changes
=chaotic
-cannot read card text upside down across the table
-card effects don't always feel thematically accurate and the story is easily lost amongst the powers and tactics (RftG handles does both of these better)
-have to learn the abilities of all 100+ cards to really 'get' the game
-counting resources across the table is frustrating. perhaps create a central board to track them?

Really nice 2 player game.  I haven't played it with a larger group, but this is excellent fun.  Very random at first, and some cards pair very well together.  However, there are usually ways to respond to a runaway player, but you have think outside the box on occasion.

Doesn't feel like civilization building in the slightest.  Rather, it comes across as abstract and dry, and the mechanics reinforce that feeling.  Also, with all the unique cards, it's too much to keep track of.  I can see the game becoming better with repeated plays, but it's not interesting enough for me to want to do that.

So far at 3 plays I am really enjoying the game.  The first 2 games were blowout wins in the favor of my opponent.  The next game was an intense head to head battle with me coming out on top.  Hopefully it can keep up that feeling as we continue to play.  The cards combo somewhat well but it really comes down to getting an awesome card that powers you up.  It's up to the other player to crush that ability.  That is where the game shines.  I hope that the counter balance can come quickly in most games.

The theme was interesting, almost like a whole game about the Civilization tech tree. And the splay mechanic was cool.

after one play. I find it rather clunky and the mechanics totally detached from it's theme. It seems quite long for what it is; a card game that seems to have a high dose of luck. It's not hard to play and the rules seem fairly clear. However the mechanics of how the icons work are rather unusual so this makes it a little hard to understand at first. The only rules problems we had was when the icon/actions told you to do something but was unclear which player was to do what (e.g. drawing a card). But not bad on the rules. 


Also the art is quite good, the icons are easy to use although one set of icons has no use at all (needed for the expansion which always frutrates me). 

It's clunky because I seemed to be always looking at the other guys cards and counting or asking him how many leaf icons or light bulb icons he has. And I simply found myself reading my own cards over and over trying to figure out what to do next. It seems hard to from a clear strategy other than simply responding to whatever cards came up; more seat of your pants than long term planning.  Its detached from the theme because the long term strategies have to do with fanning your cards in certain directions as well as how you display the icons on the cards. I dont get what this has to do with the theme of a society and it's innovations. Only one play and with only two players so maybe this will get better with more experience. Play time about 60 min which seems way too long.

Madness. This game escalates so fast. The cards get crazier for every age, opening up ever more crushing combinations. It's not a game where you eke out a minor victory. You win by wrestling control away from your opponent, shutting down their insane combination by slamming down something even more outrageous. Total madness.

Best with 2 or 3 players - more is too chaotic.

I love the way to develope a game so "complex" based only on 105 cards. Great challenge won by Carl Chudyk who is famous also for Glory to Rome (another great card game). The civilization theme and some mechanics, like splashing and cooperative/dominate dogma, makes this game a small gem. The only problem is that the game is really a random sequence and there is no possibility to build any strategy. Just follow the flow of the cards & dogma. To be played only in two.

Initially looking at Innovation without knowing how to play I thought the game looked bland. All brown and pastelly. But then I played it and liked it from the first play.

It seems like hyperbole to say that no two games of Innovation are the same, like saying no two games of Carcassonne are the same since the randomness of tile drawing and choices for tile placement mean the final board will always look at least subtley different in every game. In the end though Carcassonne is still Carcassonne with its limited decision making. Innovation on the other hand is more like playing Ace of Aces if it was a 1,000 page Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book and you got to have up to 5 pages open at any given time and were able to glance at several to dozens of other pages as well for a vast array of 'If/Then' possibilities. Sure, you've probably been on page 265 before, but not when you've also been on page 899, and certainly not when you opponent has been on page 6 and 28.

In the 10+ plays I've had (I don't think I've recorded them all) four of those games have ended due to, or with the threat of one particular card that allows the game to end with an early win for one player having 20 lightbulb icons (Empiricism). Even those four games played out dramatically different. Different certainly in getting to Age 8 to reveal that card and even different in it's affect on each game (Empiricism is 2 for 4 so far, not at all a sure thing, but nothing to ignore either).

Somehow this game is more than still enjoyable. It's still growing on me. I'm close to wanting to play it all the time.

Nice 2 players game. It's Glory-to-Rome-ish, with a lot of interaction and quite an amount of chaos, but it gets more strategic once you play more.

It's a short game, without a lot of setup time and usually short. Luck clearly plays a role in the game, but also does skill. The game punishes both not having a long-term strategy and stick too much with one of them. Since the game states changes very fast, you must always have a plan B. You can't defend for every attack you will be launched... so just try to adapt to the new situations.

The game length is quite unpredictable. Most of the games are quite short: one player gets a big advantage, gets the first 3 achievements and the game ends before the other one can fully recover. However, if the game reaches the higher eras without a clear leader, it can take a while. Sometimes, even with one player in a better position, it's really hard to translate the board domain into getting achievements, so the game takes quite a long time without being funny. Maybe this is because, since most of the games don't require age 8+ cards, we're still unfamiliar with the strategy of age 9 and 10 tableau. All in all, we've had some games whit 15 minutes of agony for one player which aren't fun at all.

All in all, it isn't the best game in the market, but it is still an original short game. It's fun for 2 people if you want something light.

Very dynamic and with strong theme. 

When nobody wins through archivments and the cards from the 9 and 10 age comes into play the game gets crazy (like cards that clears everything on the board) and sometimes even a player who was the whole game bahind can win the game.

Edit: After more plays I see, that you have more control, than you could think. 

Replaybility is extreme high. Every game is different!

After 3 Plays: This game, while certainly not a true "strategy" game, has several redeeming and fun qualities about it. First of all, the idea of moving through the ages of technology is well captured and the theme is fun. The game mechanics all mesh quite well together and in ~innovative~ ways every game. While several posts have complained about the failure to include a "catch-the-leader" mechanic, we have had no problem with this and often the game has been radically changed in a single turn by a well played use of tactics. All this together yields a cohesive and creative game with interesting mechanics and has a high replayability. 

There are several flaws with the game design, however. First of all, the rules leave much to be desired. We found ourselves frequently referring to the strategy post in the forums (which is excellent) to decipher what some of the abilities actually meant. Further, certain aspects are never addressed, like when a card can be slayed. Several of the rules are very involved and the heavy text wears on the eyes after awhile. Finally, the initial rules are so complicated in their explanation that it takes about 20-25 minutes to teach the game.

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of involved tactical card games and TCGs and has two brain cells to rub together. If you are looking for an easy game to pass time or a game that will incorporate a high strategic element (e.g. apples to apples or Axis and Allies respectively) then I would delete this game from your amazon cart promptly. 

TLDR: Fun, but complicated with a few shortcomings.

Very chaotic, but also somehow balanced in the chaos.  Someone can find a way to snap up a few achievements in a row, but their plan can be shut down in a single turn with the right card.  Compare this to Glory to Rome, where if someone gets a killer combo, the damage will be done by the time you are able to stop it.

It's a whole lot of game in a small package!  I haven't played much, but I look forward to exploring it more in the future.

Pas évident de s'y retrouver dans ses termes non courant dans le monde du jeu. Et la première partie demande beaucoup de lecture à chaque fois qu'on joue une carte. Je me demande aussi si le joueur qui prend l'avantage dans les points n'a pas un peu un run away leader. Et il est évident qu'un joueur qui connaît les cartes aura un avantage. Un jeu qu'on a avantage à jouer avec le(s) même(s) joueur(s). Quand même excellent!

This is a unique card game in which the players are "teching up" through the ages in order to be the first to get major acheivements.  There are also other alternate victory conditions, but on occasion, those can be a touch arbitrary.  I suppose once everyone knows all of the alternate win condtions it won't be as arbitrary.  I love the iconography for each technology through the game.

[i][size=18]Tableau building with a thin civilization theme[/size][/i]

I'm really not sure what to think about Innovation.  I was looking forward to it as a somewhat abstracted, quick playing civilization game.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the slightest sense of a civilization theme from anything beyond the card names.  It is all about tableau building, getting a lot of symbols, and finding some broken combination of cards.

I could see this being good as a cutthroat 2 player game (which is where I've heard it shines).  In 4 players, it was nearly impossible to keep track of what everyone else was doing.  Then, they would do some crazy ability that wrecks your board (for no thematic reason at all).  And the point scoring and stealing felt pretty arbitrary.

Clearly, I didn't *get* the game after my one play.  I can see the potential for some meat there, particular in 2 player, but I doubt I will ever find the time or desire to explore it.

One play, curious to play more. I wonder how much control there really is. I nevertheless enjoyed the first play, kept me intrigued although I didn't have the faintest clue how to approach. The second game with the same player was really intense compared to the first one. I lead almost the whole game but then my opponent got to the Age 9 and found a card which enabled him to win. That was some game!

Recently found solitaire thread and really like it. Not the fancy "SoloPlay" thread. Instead, the AI basically gets four moves every turn: draw, meld, dogma, achieve (if possible).

Fits a lot of interests for me. Powers build over time, lots of self-play - but opportunities to mess with other players, relatable theme, can always get back in the game due to extra win conditions at the end.

Still enjoying this the same way. The isotropic online version helped me improve my game through about 20 quick plays. Makes me wonder about adding the expansion for renewed craziness.

Crazy economic machine building game where the best machine does not always win. It's easy to get caught up in building the best machine, but it's so important to get points quickly to gain the achievements. The rules are a little vague, but the final production version should fix those problems. The pre-order version actually has very, very nice cards for a print-on-demand game. Can't wait to play this more. The author sure knows how to make some chaotic, out-of-control games, Glory to Rome being my favorite game.

RATING: 5
Innovation looks and feels like a last-draft prototype.  The problem is the alternate-ending condition, whereby a perfectly innocuous midgame card frequently (and accidentally) ends the game with a nearly random winner.  With a 90 minute clock time, it's just too much investment for such a volatile ending.  The shame is that Innovation is a wild and enjoyable ride until that fatal finish.

RATING: 9
Innovation is a game that really lives up to its name. It's an abstract civ-building game with a set-collection mechanic (with a nice twist - Splay that is)that takes one element of civ-building and focusses on it. Just like Roads & boats did. But where Roads & boats focussed  on logistics and thereby represented the progress of a civilization, Innovation chose an element that is just ever so logic for the flourishing of nations. Now what could be a better way to do so then by focussing on the inventions and innovations that man came up with over the ages? 

There's different innovations/inventions of all sorts. There are those that affect ecologogy, then there are those of trading, there are military inventions, there are scientifical inventions and there are cultural ideas.

You stack these cards and when the time is right (and you have the right cards) you get to splay the stack. Which means you have more icons depicted on the cards. The icons are important when it comes to the effect. So even when your opponent uses the Dogma effect of a card (which means he uses the card) you may get to benefit from it if you have enough relevant icons in play. This is a very crucial part of the game. Splaying is crucial and the direction of splay even more so. Early on in the game you get to splay your stacks to the left. Later on certain innovations will allow you to splay right or even up. These different splays reveal more icons per card:

Splay to the left:  +max. 1 icon
Splay to the right: +max. 2 icons
Splay upwards:      +max. 3 icons

Also, the type of icon might differ. So the splay kind of reminds me how you adjust your cities in Sid Meier's computer-Civilization to focus on the resource you want it to produce (knowledge, gold, food)

This game is a real brain-burner. You should take the recommendation to not play a first game with four players seriously. I have hight doubts in the stated playing time of 30 minutes. If you're familar with all the cards - and there's plenty of them and they are all different - maybe. But until now I think 30 minutes per player are more like it.

Nevertheless, the game is great fun and there's tons of meaningful decisions to take. Your opponent's plans will likely more than once make you change your strategy. Still the game is not purelxy tactical.

Tons of cards, each with a different action that theoretically can help you score achievements and win the game... But sometimes your opponent can benefit from them (or stand immune to your attacks).

It reminds me of Fluxx in terms of the volatility of winning. As the game progresses, the chance of someone making a sudden, unexpected play that wins them the game increases.

I'm basically terrible at this, but I enjoy playing it for all of the cards...

Putting aside my love of Glory to Rome, which the designer of Innovation designed as well, this is a spectacular game.  After an initial game, I can tell it'll be a game that haunts me after I play it.  Can't say that about many games.

I've heard that there is a runaway leader possibility.  I say I don't care--it's that good, that labyrinthine, it's a whopper of a game that deserves all the buzz it's getting.

RATING: 9.5
The best tactical game I own.  Innovation is a game of doing the best with what you have, not planning for what you want.  If you go in expecting it to be something else, you'll find it swingy, chaotic, and disappointing.  I've seen several games in which people get discouraged and almost give up, and then some new tech shakes the world and they're back in the running. 

I actually find it mirrors the actual progression of technologies and cultures quite nicely, as in my view the really groundbreaking developments don't emerge from government think-tanks but rather from the minds of mad geniuses.  Ideas quickly spill over borders and find new, often better uses elsewhere.  So it's not who can come up with the idea to begin with -- it's who can be in the best position to adapt to and exploit a constant influx of new and powerful ideas.  Love it.

I've went back and forth on Innovation. I first played it years ago and hated it. As a fan of more strategy-oriented games, I found it too random.

As I've grown to appreciate more chaotic games, though, I've enjoyed my more recent plays. It still feels like getting a good card or a good combo early can determine the winner more than anything, but I do like the design and the originality of the game.

1-25-2011 -- I'm a Glory to Rome fan, so naturally, I'm really excited to play Innovation.

::UPDATE::

1/7/12 -- I've had this on my shelf for nearly a year, and I was finally able to talk my wife into playing last night. It was as great as I expected it to be. It took us a bit to become familiar with the language, but not as bad as I thought it would be. Our game was very close with wild lead swings. In the early game I felt like I was walking away with it. Then Ashley quickly came back and started snatching Achievements like it was nothing. I finally got a solid top-card empire and made some tricky offensive moves to catch up on Achievements, including the first special Acheviement. Then we were deadlocked at 5 Achievements for several turns. I was one turn away from snatching another Special Achievement when Ashley took a different one and won the game!

It was great. I think when there's time, we'll both be looking forward to another go with this one. My early impressions are all positive. I'm keeping it at a 7.5 because the randomness of the cards could potentially be a bit of a balance killer. But it didn't seem to be a problem this time around. If we play a few more and it's always a close game, I'll probably have to bump it to at least an 8.

I'm glad I own this one!

I totally love civ builders and tableau builders and engine builders and this game seems to deliver on the engine part. But boy is there a clash between theme and card abilities. Sure, the provided icons relate somehow to the theme of the card, but the dogmas? They could be put on different colored teddybears for what it's worth and it would work the exact same. And there is no building up from technologies, they just happen to be cards named that way. Will definitely need some plays for me to see if I like it, but the thematic gap between what's the name of the card and the action of the cart will make it hard to get it to the table with my wife. But with more learning games I start to see more and more strategy and tactics. It still will be hard to teach and I think more than 2-3 players would not be a good idea. But it is rising on my list.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of two games this year that I think are really fun, but I'm not sure are really great (the other is Macao).  I'm not sure that the cards you receive aren't a greater influence on victory than the decisions you make.  In any case, it's very fun to play and I'm not burned out on it after 25 plays, so it has at least some staying power.

The game reminds also reminds me of the feel of another Stefan Feld game, Roma.  There can be the same landslide victories for one player - where there is no hope of recovery and the other player plows through.  But, (as in Roma) that just makes the epic back-and-forth battles that much more rewarding.  The difference between the two (besides gameplay, of course), is that getting slammed in Innovation is much more fun than in Roma.  It may last a little longer, but at least you feel like you are building something and trying to dig yourself out.

Innovation has so many different ways to win.  After several plays, I really felt a certain card was worthless - I couldn't imagine ever using it.  Sure enough, in the next game, the circumstances arose where that exact card helped me claw my way back into the game.  New combinations seem to show up frequently while learning the game.  I still feel like there's a lot to pick up after 25 plays.

While this is a highly tactical game, it is also very random. It is clear that knowing all of the cards available in each age will lend some insight into viable strategies, but I think it is a mistake to confuse this with being a deep strategy game. The tactical element is fun if you can deal with the extreme randomness. The game can shift ridiculously fast based on a single play and is designed to enable surprise wins based on lucky draws/configuration. This makes the game very accessible to people who like fast moving turbulance in their games with little control over pacing, etc. The game this reminds me the most of is Flux.

Update: Everything I hoped it would be.  It lacks a bit of the depth of Race for the Galaxy, but it has some amazing breadth.  It's a bit random and chaotic, and sometimes it feels like there's nothing you can do but watch your opponent win.  Of course, even then you hope that maybe that next card you draw will be the answer (catching you up in icons or smashing their board/score pile).  I've won from being down 5-0 in achievements twice now.  Enough skill to be interesting, enough luck to give anyone a chance.  Good stuff.

First impression, with 3 players, 5.5: 

A lot of good ideas but it is [i]chaotic[/i].  I played with 3 and couldn't imagine what it would be like with 4.  Can't tell if this is just first-game syndrome, though.  I'm told it's much better with 2.

It also doesn't feel very balanced.  The gap between some of the Age I cards is much larger than the gap between RftG cards, and with (seemingly) less opportunities to mitigate luck of the draw.

Second impression, with 2 players, 8:

OK, this is much more playable.  A ton more fun, though it is still very chaotic.  The game Glory to Rome should have been.

Third impression, after multiple plays, 9.5:

This is so much fun!  More games should have 2v2 mechanics like Innovation.  I introduce people to it and they can't wait to play again.

Holy macaroni what a bizarre game.  Carl Chudyk is either insane or a genius with these designs.

There are elements of it that a like a lot but it's chaotic as all heck and some cards seem to be incredibly overpowered.

Playing with more than 2 Players is tough because tracking the sharing of actions is a bear to maintain.

They probably should have included a board to track how many symbols everyone had, because having to constantly count is tedious.

I like this game better than Glory to Rome.

A chaotic game that manages to be great fun despite its serious flaws.

The game's high points are infinite replayability and ease of play. It manages to be captivating, despite its randomness. The icon collection part is enjoyable, and it does give some control to an otherwise chaotic game.

Now let me clarify ease of play. This game is simple, IF you understand excellent english AND you're an experienced gamer. Better if you're a hardcore gamer. For anything from average players and below, the game is simply an unplayable chore. And no, you can't even think of playing if you have a simple "good" knowledge of the language. But even if you're eligible to play it, it is chaotic. Cards are not only random and somewhat unbalanced, but also potentially broken. Nothing is sacred, and your hard earned points can be devastated by a lucky draw. Efficient play is also surprisingly hard, and this is exactly what gives this game the impression that it is skill based. A good player will beat a bad player because the latter didn't see in time the use of his cards. But between two good, or two bad players... the result is based heavily on luck.

In the end, this game manages to be fun to an irritating(!) level. Despite its flaws, I do like it a lot, and keep asking to play it.

Initial rating: 9 with room to go up.  I haven't been this captivated by a game in a while.  I don't just want to have it be part of the regular rotation, I want to play it over and over again.  I can really only make the same comment about Race for the Galaxy, Imperial and (back in the day) Settlers of Catan (although I've since mostly played that one out).  Two of those three are still 10s for me, so Innovation is in good company.

The mechanics are very cool, particularly the splaying of stacks of cards.  There is a lot of chaos and randomness to maneuver through, but that feels right for this type and length of game.  Many cards seem crazily powerful, but that is part of the fun rather than detracting from the experience -- especially because one game's super powerful card may have little to no impact in the following game.  What really gets me is how a game with fairly simple rules and only cards as components can give so much feel of civilization building.  The advances and their effects largely make sense:  I develop writing and speed my advance to the next age; I develop gunpowder and can now blow up your castles; etc.

RATING: 10
Hoo Haw this is a good time.  Nice mix of screwage, development, and trade offs.  Cashing in on a good scoring opportunity comes at the cost of development, but it is tough to win without scoring opportunities.  Three games in and it seems the early game is focused around a few cards.  I love the feel of development, and the rise of a civilization.  This gives the game a nifty comeback, and a nice balance between trying the lengthen and shorten the game.  Loving this game right now.  I'm constantly uncovering new tricks and defenses.  

I'm surprised I enjoy such a tactics heavy game so much.  I guess the trade off in lack of strategy is compensated by the interesting development arc of each civilization. (Actually with more play the strategical arc has started to develop for me, its more vague in style such as ensure you aren't behind in both crowns and leaves)

There does not seem to be a normal pace in this game.  Sometimes the early is frantic, sometimes the middle, sometimes the middle and the end.  Plus sometimes points are easy to come by and easy to keep, sometimes they are impossible to get and tougher to keep.  This game does not seem to have a normal type game.  Its a game of constantly shifting pacing and style, with very situational plays.  This is why I like it a lot, and really enjoy it.  I think its a 2 player game for my liking, but time will tell.

7 plays in.  Easy 10.  I have fun playing it (I play by the rules) and the game forces you to learn and understand the possible ways to get ahead.  I'm awful at this game and keep coming back for more.

I enjoy the decisions present, the trade offs, and playing the hand I'm dealt.  The thing that sets this game apart in my eyes is my anticipation and curiosity of which card will be the superstar this game, based upon game states.

This game will leave you frustrated from time to time.  Not in the Agricola sense of "There are so many things I want to do, but I don't have the time" but more in general helplessness due to the weakness of the  basic action compared to dogmas in the right situation.   

At the time of writing this comment, I have played this game at least once for 8 straight days and I'm still enthralled.  Well it was a 10 before me and my opponent became better, and well quite frankly it has even become more enjoyable to play since we improved our skill.  This game will be a staple for years to come for me.

After 42 plays, I have started to see the game in a slightly different light strategy wise.  The interplay between icons, future innovations based upon those icons, short term scoring vs. long term development and the end game.  This is deeper than I first thought, rating going up...... oh shit its already a 10.  Ummm... Its a really really good 10.

It is significantly better at lower player counts.  I'd grab another game if 4 players are looking to play something (haven't tried the team rules)

RATING: 9
Excellent light civ development game. I'm a bit concerned about a couple of cards being over powered in a 2 player game. They work just fine in a 4 player game as I've seen them in action. 

Along with San Juan and Glory to Rome this is another game that plays so pristine with 2 players it's just down right silly.

I love this game! It is a joy to play for me. There are so many ways of Playing: Build up your "tableau" with tucks and splays, Score tons of cards and achieve, go on the offensive, and so much more. Every game plays entirely different. I love the escalation of abilities as you move up through the ages. I can't see my self ever getting tired of this game.

Wonderful card game! I really enjoy games where you have to build something, starting from scratch. Some of the tableaus you can have while playing this game really make you feel proud. The game can be a little swingy, but it is intense when you get into the later ages.

There's a core idea here that I really liked, which seemed quite true to the supposed theme of the advancing science and technology of civilizations. Basically you can only have five cards in play at one time (one of each color). Cards have a several icons on them which count towards a handful of metrics. At first there are a lot of "castles," but these disappear and give way to things like "factories" and then "timers." The ability of the card is also tied to a single metric. If the ability hurts another player, it only works against someone inferior in that metric. If the ability helps yourself, everyone superior in that metric gets to piggyback off of your move and also use it before you. So there can be tension between the need to improve what you have in play (generally you'd like to have cards from the latest eras possible; or at least cards with good abilities), and the "arms race" of a given metric, since "upgrading" a card in play could hurt in you a metric that currently matters.

Overall though it loses points for all the reading and re-reading of cards, and for special abilities in general (not my cup of tea), and for the luck of the draw being so important. It seems to happen very frequently that despite having a bunch of cards in hand and in play, nothing will do what you need, so you just draw a new card and hope it gets you somewhere. You can also e.g. luck into a card that lets you drain someone else's points turn after turn.

A play of the game may tell an interesting story but there's little potential for negotiation. Offensive powers always target everyone they can, and nothing can be traded.

...Playing again with different expectations. I can certainly see this as a civilization game in the way the advancement of technologies defines a course for the game, with varying gameplay over that course. The symbols and especially colors are more abstract than expected for the genre, but there's no mistaking that the colored piles in your tableau constitute your civilization.

While I don't normally like special powers, in this game there is nothing other than special powers. I can respect it as a fairly simple system (as I like simple systems) that happens to be based on special powers.

I criticize the game as random and chaotic, but it's also tactical, and making the best move at a given moment is not necessarily easy, not necessarily pointless (i.e. drowned out by luck). I can respect the puzzles that Innovation presents. I have no doubt that one can be more skilled or less skilled at playing.

It looks and feels unbalanced but that doesn't necessarily mean a runaway leader will win. Quite often a new strong card will help the others claw back at the leader quickly.

Very good card game from the designer of Glory to Rome that introduces novel card mechanics.  We have the early 1st printing from April 2010.  The gameplay ramps up quite a bit faster than GtR in that you do not need additional cards to activate a card's power.  Once a card has been played in your play area, you can use its power as one of your 2 actions that turn.  (Provided the card is the top of its stack.)  There are many cards which affect other players, making it a very interactive game.

I didn't really like this the couple times I played this 4-player. As a 2-player game, it was alright but strongly swingy.

Update: After another 2P game, I'm seeing what it's really about. Every ability is strong, and everything just gets stronger and crazier. While everything seems "broken," the most broken ones are so situational that the game is about using the other abilities to create those right situations. Tense and strategic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Chaotic, but not so much so that you can't form at least some kind of plan. That's probably also highly dependent on how much you're able to commit to learning the game deeply. I'm not.

The theme didn't really come through for me. I very quickly stopped even reading the names of most of the cards since they seemed to have so little to do with what the card did.

Some of the terminology is stupid. You "meld" a card ... even if there's no other card yet for it to meld with.  Why not just "play" the card, like in every other game on the planet? And "dogma" is a complete non-sequitur as a description for activating most cards' abilities (e.g. what the heck is "gunpowder dogma?"). Could it at least have used a *verb*, like with the other actions? This stuff makes the game needlessly harder to learn.

Ultimately, though, none of this ruins the game for me. It's pretty pleasant, and I would happily play again. And, of course, the card-splaying design is quite clever, so points for that.

This isn't a game about calculating the optimal play & then repeat. You don't build an engine because anything you build is transient. This tactical transiency feeds constant drama, a state that persists in this game from beginning to end, and after over a hundred plays it maintains that interest & drama. 

You learn it as a purely tactical game, but as you get familiar with the deck (not memorize, just familiar) strategy rises to structure the tactical riches.

During a game of Innovation an amazing array of choices rise - and I don't mean the same choices arise game after game so you get to script a good combo tactic - I mean this stuff [i]does not repeat[/i]. Each card is unique, yes, but the context of that card (it's relationship to each other card currently in play, to the game state, and to the opponent's style of play) radically changes not only it's usefulness, but what it can do, whether or not actions could be leeched, and what it means. And as your mind ratchets through the possibilities it zero's in on a choice but you never really know it's [i]the most optimal[/i]. It's a playground. 

And also, in Innovation there is constant direct interaction with the other player & with their cards; this game is about screwage, not simply leeching. And man can it rebound on you.

Easily one of my very favorite games. It's witty as well - each game forms a narrative, and there's wit in the matching of card names to effects.

Takes too long due to the need to read a lot of card text and count icons on every player's cards.

Difficult to implement a strategy because things change so quickly.

This game forces you to interact with your opponents while you advance your civilization.  There are a couple different tactics to play and you can't choose your tactic at the outset: it will depend on your civilization and your opponents.

The rules are straight-forward, the decisions are many and fun, the combos are fantastic.

As a two-player game I actually don't mind it - I'd rate it maybe a 6 - but with more, it has problems. There's too much downtime, too many cards in other people's displays to easily track, and most importantly, too much chance that one player will get caught in a war between two other players.

If this were advertised as a two-player game with optional rules for more if you really wanted, I'd give it the 6 rating. But it's not.

Rating based on one play. There definitely are some clever ideas here, but there are a lot of things I don't like as well. I just don't like too much generally these "magic style" combo-buildings games, with teadious action descriptions on the cards. Also, there is lot of fiddling with cards and counting symbols etc. Already with two players it was quite difficult to find out what other players were doing. So all and all, quite a dissapointment unfortunately.. :(

01/07/14 Upgraded from 5 to 7. 
31/08/14 Upgraded from 7 to 8.
30/09/14 Upgraded from 8 to 9.

I've gone from not understanding this game, to finally being to get a feel for what's going on. That's after 30 games. 

The first few ages are quite familiar, but the final ages are incredibly perplexing. The higher ages start snowballing to the endgame in an out of control fashion. Fantastic game!

Wow, I've been getting lots of plays against the AI and finally beat the hardest level AI (100%). Won by trying to draw an age 11 card with 150 points in the bank to 0. Mind you, it's not all about the points!

Note: This game is not good multiplayer (3 or more people). You lose the ability to respond quickly enough to the changing landscape due to another person taking the potential cards that could help alter the course of the game. If you fall behind as well, you're really stuck. I also don't think the expansions are required at all. 90%+ of the games I've played have been base game only and it still has legs.

I like the mechanics more than the resultant game.

1 game to learn how to play- TONS more games before you are playing with enough knowledge of the cards and potential paths that your informed decisions come close to overpowering the random elements inherent in the system.

which is to say, for those tons of learning games, you're mostly making purely tactical decisions and hoping cards come up in your favor and not in your opponent's.  the fluxx comparison isn't wholly accurate, as EVENTUALLY you will be well enough apprised of the situation that your choices are meaningful (whereas you can never really reach that point in fluxx).  

the real issue for me is that, while i'm ok with a steep learning curve,  i kind of want the interaction during that curve to still be interesting, and it's not-  neither while i'm learning, nor while i would be playing with any new player trying to catch up on the curve...  because until you crest that peak, you are pretty much just in random land.  and that's a lot of bad games until you reach the good stuff... and then some more bad games whenever you want a new, real opponent.  and once everyone IS at a similar skill level, then the random elements are generally what's determining the winner, not clever play.  There's a very small window of "interesting and competitive play".

I'm cool with a steep learning curve, but I'd prefer it not be a curve that is mandatory, long, and unfun... but necessary to get over the hump of the random elements in the game.

This is a game that feels like a chaotic mess with a lot of the flow of the game being pretty random based on what cards you happen to have available.  Theoretically this goes down if you truly know the game and cards available well, but that is a level of play almost nobody will reach.

However, it's still a fun process.  The interactions can be crazy, and there's simply a lot of fun, powerful things you can do - and every game plays out differently.

Relatively quick to play, very portable, lots of replayablity with the different card combinations. On the downside, isn't the most accessible game for new players because of all the text on the cards. Can't wait for the expansion.

RATING: 5
Since the game changes fast and at random I would put it into the light filler category. However, there is a lot of text unique to each card so it requires a lot of reading and stretching ver the table to read others cards, bogging the game down a bit. My main problem is that I am not sure what it is and what it is trying to be. It feels like the mix of light filler and deep game just doesn't work.

Amazing 2p game, haven't seen anything like it. Everything about this game is unusual: the cards (every card is unique! what? seriously.), the effects, the terminology (ever melded/splayed cards before?), the scoring, the unexpected (but thematic) endgame conditions

Note: there's a strong learning curve with this one; don't expect any startegy nor thematic flavor in the first few games. once you start knowing a few cards, you will start seeing the strategies and the theme shining through; then you'll know more cards, and more strategies, and it grows thematically strong in the process; and for me it keeps improving after many plays!

[+] rules are easy, cards and art are nice, outisde-the-box-thinking is required, gameplay improves and refines with experience 
[-] although the box say it's a 2-4p game, it really shines with 2. 3 kinda works... 4 with teams is fiddly... 4p is a mess.

Definitely a game that grew on me.  The decisions are mostly tactical, and a strategy is made or broken based on what cards you can get, but the best players are still usually going to win by identifying the best combinations and striving for those.  This is a high-luck game, but it's short enough that I don't mind.  The different cards are all quite overwhelming at first, but it gels pretty quickly.  The decision space is never so large as to be confusing.

After one play, I'm putting this at an 8. I feel it could move to a 9 if it remains well received after more plays. 

This felt like Through The Ages (A game I've only had a chance to play on Boardgamearena.com) but in a more digestible format. 

It has the abstract concepts turned into game mechanics (Tech tree)that is one of my biggest draws to civ building games, and quite a bit of player interaction.

 There are multiple ways to win, and they feel interlinked and yet varied enough to be balanced. My favorite mechanic was that the "score" in the game is what determines winner if the game reaches it's "out of cards" game end, BUT they score is always used throughout the game to pay purchase game ending (when you get 6) achievement cards as well. 

Overall, the game has that slow start, momentum gaining feel that a civ game should have, leading into a headlong tech race once you advance a few ages. One complaint is that there is no unique civ/player powers, but the gameplay actually leads you to develop these through the cards you play anyway so it's not really a true negative. 

My biggest criticism was that I lost to a card-specific victory condition that was played and triggered on one turn, meaning I had no way to try to counter it. Of course, I could have been attempting to get my opponent to discard cards, or randomly deny them resources, but I had no warning of what he would need to beat me with that card beforehand. This will likely be less of an issue if you play the same game a lot since you will know about when that card could come up.

Anyway, this game is great in a small package. The rules are a bit dense, but it's nothing that 15-20 mins of teaching and Q&A won't handle.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Brilliant card game. Complex, but easy to learn and comes in a small box.

The second printing (I think), or at least the version I got, has attractive glossy cards.

Not much to do with civilisation building, but it's a mechanically-interesting game with lots of choices and decisions.

This is my most played modern board game to date. My brother and his girlfriend are obsessed, so consider this a great gateway game for friends/family who have experiencing playing cards/card games.

The base game is so clever that learning the game is a breeze. Its one of those games that makes sense as you play it. I really like the decisions of whether to screw your opponent or build your "civilization". I'm using quotes there because my brother's girlfriend was surprised when I told her its a civ building game. After 2 months+ of continuous play she never realized it, or didn't care.

I like to take a look at the end game and describe my civilization verbally in anthropological like terms. It can be hilarious win or lose.

RATING: 4
I've given this game two tries, and I think that's enough to determine that this is simply not my kind of game.  I'm puzzled by the strong reputation this game has, because all it seems to be to me is a big game of take that, with players hitting other players for points and such.  There's some semblance of control in the game, since you can protect yourself with the number of icons you have in your display, but you're still more or less at the mercy of the draw, and besides, the game then becomes a very random, chaotic game of area control.  I don't want to have to play something like that.  It's also nearly impossible to plan ahead in this game, since the entire state of the game can change before your next turn, either through changing icons or someone swapping hands of cards with you.  Either way, I'm not interested.

One thing I thought was interesting about the game was that it appears to be easy for people to lose sight of the achievements, at the cost of building up a boatload of points each turn.  In one of the games I played, one player probably could have ended the game at the halfway mark by taking achievements, but he got blinded by the pursuit of more points.  It reminded me of early games of Dominion, where players got distracted by the action cards.

[Asmadi edition] Great card game, lots of tactical depth but also chaotic even if not that much luck-driven. It's focused more on card management than long-term strategy. Very fast to play.
I also appreciate very much the minimalistic but very functional look of the Asmadi edition in contrast with the beauty-over-substance of the Iello edition, which is nicer to watch, but harder to play.

This new game by Carl Chudyk is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times. Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!
\13\\13\
To win, you must score achievements, which you can attain by amassing points or by meeting certain criteria with the innovations you have built. Plan your civilization well, and outmaneuver your opponents, and with some luck you will achieve victory!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A civilization game that has been abstracted and condensed down until it's simulating nothing more than the race through mankind's technology tree. The game is pure genius, but maybe to its detriment, because its design is so far outside the box that it can be hard to wrap your head around it...at least strategically.

Your first few games, it can be difficult to understand where you have any control of your strategy. It will seem very random. Fluxx-like, as the game's detractors say. Draw a card, play a card, or activate a card...choose two each turn. That's it. 

Innovation does so much with so little rules overhead that its considerable depth is often missed. There's no military to speak of, but there certainly is war. There's no economy to run, but you can bankrupt yourself out of being able to function. The fact that the game creates this dynamic with such a basic turn structure is absolutely amazing.

This has become the 2-player card game of choice in my house and I really don't see that changing any time soon. Ten games in and I'm still finding new ways to move faster up the tech tree or to throw monkey wrenches into my opponent's plans. Don't believe the one game and done critics, this game gets deeper and more complex with every single play.

Tactical options are limited to a few available techs, which you have very little control over. You will usually have one clearly best course of action: Tense choices are few and far between.

The variety of techs makes each game wildly different than the last, but nevertheless it feels like playing on rails.  Probably better for players who enjoy dramatic swings in momentum more than exercising player skill.

I appreciate that the chaotic nature of the game is intended, and I do like that kind of thing in games, but Innovation feels as though it pushes it outside the players' control across the boundary of pointlessness.

In my first game, it felt like no-one really made any important decisions which seemed to randomly create an environment in which players could more or less only take a single optimal action. A margin was established and there seemed to be no way to close it.

I say this as the alleged winner but it barely felt like I either strategised or adapted/improvised to achieve any of it. I felt like the cards, their draw timing and the limits of their potential effects determined the outcome, barely the players' decisions.

Some great, quirky ideas at work here, just like with GTR. Very expensive for what you get.  Scaling is clearly weird, and is (I guess) related to the deck size.  Seems to me they should have either stopped at 7 ages, 15 cards each (more for Age 1, of course) or gone to 165 cards for 10 Ages.  Then you can just discard a few off the top when playing with 2 or 3 (say, 4 cards for 2p, 2 cards for 3p) and get a roughly similar experience.  As is, the decks are way too thin for 4p.

Oh, and look, the expansion explicitly addresses this. Guess it's hard to begrudge a small company doing things like this, but it's not exactly nice.

RATING: 8
After playing this game a couple more times Its starting to grow on me.  I do think this game shines as a two player game, and it really gives me the feeling of a civ building game.  I think the splaying tactic that this game uses is pretty awesome, and allows for some pretty cool techniques.  I do also feel that a lot of this game makes you also pay attention to what your opponent is doing, because if you are not keeping up with them their is a potential for them to really mess with your tableau once you get to those later ages.  overall a pretty fun game!

Great concept and great execution.  I have only played 2-player, so the counting of icons issue was minimal.  The advancements (technologically and also the acceleration towards victory) seemed to pick-up quickly once the latter periods were reached.  I think this is where a more random factor may rear its ugly head.  However, the play overall was very enjoyable and I look forward to additional plays.

Advance through the ages of human innovation. Abstract civilization builder by drawing from the stacks of leveled discoveries to play on your growing civilization. The trick in this game is the "tuck" and "splay" of cards on how you arrange the innovation icons to manage majority to preempt, block or share other player actions. Build and transition the strength of your city as it evolves with the ages and how it interacts with other players. Brilliantly thought out powerful card interactions and unique game play with a challenging puzzle that gets crazy in the last ages.  Not for the faint of heart--very cut throat.

Our game was cut short by some particularly powerful card combinations, and even then the game went on for too long.

I suppose it's momentarily interesting when a reality-altering level 9 or 10 card hits the table, but I don't have the interest to make it that far.  And for every "OK, that's sorta cool" player comment, there are twice as many "that's just unfair and frustrating" mutterings.  Count me among the mutterers.

Civ building card game. You get to do 2 things from the four - draw, meld, score, or dogma (special card action). An early lead can go away quickly if you do not continue to develop your new technologies. Normally cards of the same color stack but you can "splay" them to spread them out. Very innovative idea.

This is a fun game that can get extremely chaotic with three or four players, almost like a super advanced version of Fluxx. It's nearly impossible to plan more than a turn or two ahead, so you have to play tactically and go for whatever short-term goal is best for you at the given moment.

Played a handful of games on a friend's pre-production copy.  I can't wait to get my own.

Just as with Glory to Rome, I liked this game from the very first play.  And also like GtR, after a few more plays I can see that there is plenty of game to explore.

Figuring out the relationships among the wide variety of cards will be fun.  Our games are getting tighter as we begin to figure out the system.  The first few games were won by a large margin.

I like the sharing powers mechanism and the simplicity of a turn.  I like the emergent complexity that comes from the interactions of the cards.  The game has a nice arc to it.  There is plenty of interaction.

10/29/10:  Bumped to 9.  Lots of things to discover.  Fun whether I'm winning or losing.

RATING: 9
Good fun. Initially, it felt like there wasn't much skill involved in the game, but it was interesting enough to draw me back for multiple plays. However, after learning more of the cards, I see how you can shape your strategy and react to what an opponent is doing. You can certainly learn to get better at the game, but occasionally you'll have the odd game which ends in a complete blow-out. You need to accept the crazy powerful card abilities as part of the charm.

I really like the stacking and Splaying mechanism for hiding and revealing icons. That's something I haven't seen before and feels new and integral to this game.

It took me a few plays to get over the initial feeling of being overwhelmed by the chaos, but I'm enjoying it more with each play.

Okay, lets get this out of the way first.  Aesthetically the game is pure ugly.  Blighted by terribly uninviting 'artwork' to be sure, but oh how the gameplay shines through.  I have never played a game that felt this... well put together.  Everything just makes sense.  For each and every card the game function brilliantly matches the theme.  A masterpiece.

First play seemed very promising, but left me with the nagging feeling that there is no controlling the chaos, and that a bad start can practically elimate you. Further plays confirmed that suspiscion.

Yes, I'm aware that there are ways to mitigate the luck of the draw and that skilled players will do better than novices, but the ratio of chaos to fiddliness is too high. The theme is there in the names of the cards and some of the achievements, but the effects of the cards doesn't tie into the theme at all.

Tons of card variety and randomness. Gameplay is simple and completely focused on how cards interact with each other. Very well done, but may take a few plays to really shine as knowledge of cards or when icons are important can really change the game. Best with two, good with 3, avoid it with 4 (just play GtR instead).

So much game in such a small box.  Seems kind of complicated at first, but really it's not too bad.  Innovation gets to be rather swingy in the later ages, which is both awesome and terrible.  On one hand, if you're down late, you're never out - because things can turn very quickly.  On the other hand, if you're up late, you can never guarantee victory, because things can turn very quickly.  Every card seems OP, but if all cards are OP, is any one card really OP?

{ P - [2] 3 4 }

Wonderful head-to-head game with a great mixture between strategy and tactics. The rules are simple but mastery is elusive. There are many "goals" to pursue - score points, develop infrastructure (symbols) by melding and splaying, obtain alternate achievements, destroy your opponent's score, develop your hand by drawing cards, leap-frog to higher tech levels - and which you need to be doing right now can change at any moment. There are cards with very obvious synergy like Paper + Perspective, Fermenting + Reformation, or Philosophy + Invention, while there are more subtle combinations like Medicine + Navigation or Agriculture + Education. There are single card strategies as well such as Gunpowder, Bicycle, Democracy, and Machine Tools. Some cards are better than others, but most of the good ones are still only situationally good, and it is up to the player to recognize and foster these situations. Innovation maintains a delicate balance between consistency (a particular card you want has a 90% chance to be available, the alternate achievements are always the same) and variance (the cards are randomly ordered). There's too much chaos and not enough control for me when you add more players but with two it's something worth studying.

RATING: 3
I'm not a fan of this one due to the large amount of randomness in the game.  Many games have a random draw element, but have much less luck involved either by having fewer cad options (a large deck made up of only a few types of cards; (Tempus), A construction element before the building (Dominion), or the ability to choose instead of taking the random card (Hacienda).  In this game there is only one of each card, and the power of the cards varies quite a bit causing it to be largely luck based.

There certainly is still skill involved, but I'd rather play without that element given the choice.

Symbols mechanism (splaying) is innovative. The card back artwork is simple but apt. The card front artwork and icons, however, leaves much to be desired. The sabotage element of the cards makes the game too swingy.

This card-game slides me into an unpleasant, transient affective state in which I feel a pervasive lack of interest in the game, and have huge difficulty concentrating on any current activity it tries to suck me into.

Ugly, drab cards + uninteresting design = a game lacking in the stimulation department.

But, WTF do I know? All my friends who have played it liked it....

RATING: 9
Awesome. 

Very Chudyk styled. Similar to Glory to Rome in that it's mostly tactics based (rather than strategic). Can get even more chaotic than GtR though. Splaying is one of the coolest new mechanics I've seen in a while. 

It's small, portable, easy to set up, and fairly quick, yet has strong depth. 

Also has plenty of "take that" in case you don't like passive euros or multiplayer solitaire.

Though my wife and I like Dominion very much, we just love this game. It brings a kind of new wind in the civilization "card game" genre. We also own "Through the Ages" of course, but this is just so amazing!

We both really can highly recommend this!

RATING: 6
Close games of Innovation are just excellent and keep you on the edge of your seat... but luck of the draw can lead to lots of lopsided, uninteresting games as well.  This gets compared to Fluxx a lot... and the big swings of board position can feel similar... but that's where the similarity ends.  This is all about making tactical decisions to find the best combo or single card your opponent can't share to further your position in the game. It might run a bit long based on all the reading of card necessary, but the strong tactical play can be quite engaging all the same.

RATING: 6
Disappointing, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised Innovations employed some similar mechanics from Glory to Rome.  Unintuitive card powers aside, the whole deal with tucking away score so you can earn achievements that will then make those points to actually worth something is just as burdensome as the multiple steps of putting away cards from hand to stockpile to vault or foundation in GtR.  Not to mention the fact that your tableau can change from turn to turn, having to recalculate your icons again and again becomes a process that is more work than fun.

While I don't shy away from complicated games, but I do tend to find card games that aren't streamlined to be a chore to play.  Unfortunately, Innovations just didn't click for me at all and once is enough for me to see all that it has to offer.

This is the swingiest, stupidest game I have ever played. There is so much randomness that you simply do not receive any satisfaction from winning or or even doing well. The only "pleasure" you can extract is when you get to use a card to destroy whatever haphazard arrangement another player has managed to cobble together. And that card is not something you plotted to acquire, it was bestowed upon you through luck of the draw.
 This game is dumb.

Awesome idea...ten ages, each age consisting of a deck of age-relevant "innovations".  Each card has a symbol-dependent ability.

Play is a bit counter-intuitive, and points don't win the game for you.  Kind of hard to wrap your head around without a number of back-to-back plays.

Wow, this is just a freakin' excellent game. It's really... Innovative!

Sits in an interesting spot though, too chaotic for serious strategists and too dry for many others but it's just fun and every game plays out so differently. You get an awful lot of game in a small box.

3p is my favourite.

edit - With repeated plays I'm wishing it was more thematic and less wordy.

RATING: 5
This game is innovative, and features singular gameplay; however, there's a heck of a lot of conflict and beatdown, and a heavy dose of other players undoing slow, painstaking work in an instant.  So, while I greatly respect this game's freshness and its allowance for lateral thinking, the experience is not much to my tastes.  Plenty of people are lapping it up, though, which is great.  I'd hate to see such fresh ideas going to waste out of the spotlight.

Text-heavy, so you'll have to take your first few games slow.  Still, a game that gets requested by recently-introduced players.

Innovation is fast, fun, and changes in interesting ways from one game to the next.  Particularly, which cards are a factor can vary drastically depending on what icons you and your opponents have in play.

Overall, an intelligent game system that is somewhat marred by the fact that when you know what you need to do, you still need a little luck o' the draw to do it, but then redeemed by a short play-time and a sense of accomplishment within each game.

Don't be alarmed when early games end quickly.  More skilled play (which comes with familiarity of the cards) extends the game into its final rounds as often as not.

RATING: 6.75
Chaos.  But fun chaos.  Those who favor designing a grand engine and then having it run its course will find this game intolerable.  Once you have that engine running, someone is going to screw with it.  That's what makes the game fun, of course, but if you don't care for "take that" mechanics this is certainly not for you.

After playing a game with both the echoes and figures expansions added in, I'd say you probably don't want to play this "all in."  More like pick one expansion per game and use it.  Put the others aside.

When I tried a 3-player game, I updated to a 9: This game really deserved better than '8', because the design is elegant and very nicely done, it's really an excellent game. Probably one of the most interesting "over-powered card effects" game side Cosmic Encounter. But this is one of the games that make me bite my nails; I want to do something on my turn, but my plans can be so thoroughly thwarted by other card's effects that it's... well, stressy.
Elegant design, the messiness part of it, but it gets on my nerves a bit. Played on 3, it gets on my nerves less, as every player has 2 opponents, you are not always the main target. It does, however, require that all players are comfortable with the game to begin with. It's a LOT of concepts to get used to.

A friend of mine won't let me stop playing it. It's not a bad game per se - it often gives players LOTS of various options. The problem is, over half the time, NONE of those are good enough. Too easily decided by one player lucking into a killer combo, but the *good* games are VERY, VERY good. It's often like a puzzle - few games lend themselves to "I could have WON!" fridge logic, but this one has that in spades.

Played with four. Seems to promise some novel and interesting card interactions, but this is quickly undercut by the chaotic nature of the game. Might be more palatable if it wasn't so easily prone to AP from all the card effects. That some of the cards can be quite randomly nasty compounds the problem. You can't even take solace in a well presented theme, either, since it feels almost totally disconnected from its subject and is really just abstract.

RATING: 8
It's not random, but you need to know what ages the important cards are in, and what some of the important game-breaking combos are. That's kind of the bummer when you introduce it to new players, like Race for the Galaxy and others. But it's still very good and I enjoy it.

It's not bad.  I liked it.  It doesn't hold a candle to Glory to Rome, though.  It's nigh impossible to have much of a strategy in Innovation, which is my chief complaint against it.  

UPDATE:  Everything I said above still applies, but I'll amend it to say that it only applies for three- and four-player games.  Innovation is quite excellent as a two-player game.  The rating will stay the same, because it's not worth playing it as anything other than a two-player game, but, if it were a two-player-only game, it would be a 9, pushing toward a 10.

I sometimes think of this game as a simpler Through the Ages.  There's a teching stage, there's a bit of aggressiveness in keeping the opponent's scoring sets low, and it can be fun setting the combos up to pin someone or wreck them entirely.  It's fun and decently engaging.

A Civ building game that just focuses on the 'big discoveries' throughout history. Solid mechanics, good interaction (some quite nasty take that stuff in later eras) and a short playtime. A game I like quite a lot.

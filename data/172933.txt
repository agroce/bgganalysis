Our favorite filler/gateway game. I love the adventure theme, and I like how there are significant tradeoffs and decisions to be interesting for adults while still being a game that is accessible and fun for kids. Just the right amount of thinking for a family game, while still delivering some good laughs and excitement.

Borrowed this from our school. Wow, a great surprise. A little bit more involved than a simple kids game. Takes number and card combinations to the next step in having to choose how to attack each monster, strike, stomp, scream. Illustrations are great. Kids haven’t figured it all out yet,  but still enjoy it. Great for reinforcing addition skills.

This is a excellent children's game that does a very good job teaching various card mechanics. This game is not something that would make it into many adult gaming sessions, however if you take it for what it is, it's very well made. Another benefit of the game is that its quick enough that it can be used as a filler while waiting for additional players or while more complex games are being setup. 

I acquired the game to play with my 8 yr daughter and she absolutely loved the game and regularly requests to play.

Gamewright.  The box says 8 on the age and it's probably right.  Just played it with my 7 and 4 year-olds.  The 4-year-old needed a lot of help, but had fun rolling and trying to capture creatures.  The 7-year-old understood, but not completely.

I see this be very fun in our household in the next few years.

Played at Loading Bar, the feature game. Not much interaction but does it need it?

Interesting choices (what type of sets to make, how safe to play it when going for a monster, whether to hit an easy monster for easy regular points or go less frequently, with a 3pointer, or get an accessory to buff you up for later).

We had plenty of laughs and exciting times.

The accessories make the game a bit different at the end, giving it a wonderful arc.

I won 17-17-13-9 and played with awesome new friendly folk (Chris, Hannah Nick whilst Leo came mid-game to watch) so I'm biased. :-p

We all wanted to play again but the copies were all being played with by other folk.

This is an excellent children's game.  Very enjoyable even as an adult.  Uses a lot of mechanics that are familiar from deck-building games with a twist that you are using runs of colors or numbers to determine how many dice you will use to attack a card.  Great game in all respects.  7 or 8 years plus and I would also play this with an adult.

Fun little game. Rummy set your cards to gain an equivalent number of dice which you then roll to gain objects or defeat creatures. Creatures get you victory points. Plays in about 20 minutes.
We played twice in a row. Daughter won both times. She rates it a nine. Playing more cards gets you more dice making it easier to defeat the creatures. Definitely going to play this one frequently.

I bought this to play with my 10-year-old son. This really is a great game for teaching strategy and probability (just like the box states). It's been helpful for teaching him that, while we may have a good strategy, we should also be flexible as the cards we draw may not align with the strategy we have chosen. Such is life. 

For two players, the instructions recommend we remove 12 cards from the Dragonwood deck. We use all the cards in the Dragonwood deck. It really doesn't extend the game that long. Removing the cards makes for a shorter game.

Another rule modification is to allow for two attacks per turn. The second attack can only be taken if the first attack is successful, however.

Dragonwood provides players with just the right amount of decisions for a light, yet enjoyable game. The various ways of attacking something give you options for how to manage your hand, and are just plain fun (I mean, who doesn't like screaming at pile of ooze?!). Dragonwood isn't a deep game that you'll be talking about for days, but it is a bullseye for that niche somewhere between -an appetizer and the main course.

Dragonwood mixes cards and dice in an intriguing and enjoyable way.  It's not just all about playing the right cards at the right time, it's got a little more luck to it than that.  I can imagine many people not enjoying luck stacked with luck, but for me, it makes for quite an enjoyable time.  I'm also incredibly surprised at how close the scores seem to be.  Good stuff.

Lots of luck involved because you are drawing cards to make runs, flushes or pairs that then give you dice to roll to try to beat a number on a card.
Plays pretty quickly and certainly isn't a brain burner unless you try to figure the odds on every move you make.

RATING: 7
We enjoy this game best when playing with the Advanced Variant where instead of drawing blindly off the top of the deck you can either do that or select from 1 of 2 face up cards.  This adds another choice to the game and seems to speed it up just a bit such that the game length is now tolerable for what it is.  Normally on your turn you get NO card draws at all unless you forgoe your turn's attack to draw a single card.  I'm still not sure I like that rule as it seems more a rule just to be different rather than something that comes across as clever or meaningful.  Seems like it would have been much more straight forward to just draw a card each turn and then attack if you choose to.  Interesting is that the penalty for losing an attack is very friendly as you just lose any one card from your hand (Not even a card that you used to attack if you do not wish).

Our 8 year old son had some thematic problems with the game.  In the game you can Strike, Stomp, or Scream (Straight, Pairs/Sets, or Flushes).  His problem was that Sword Strikes seemed like they should do way more damage than stomping or screaming at a monster.  I tried explaining the Stomp as representing perhaps unarmed combat in general and the scream as a magical spell but he wasn't really buying it especially given its hardest to do strikes in the game vs stomps or screams.  Perhaps the game would go over thematically better with Age 6 or so.

My other concern is with the item cards.  Early in the game they seem very worthwhile but later on they just clog up the display (you put out 5 cards at random) such that we've had 3-4, of the 5 cards displayed, items that no one wanted.  Couple that with the fact that monsters are all very samey (Differing slightly in statistical numbers to beat based upon Victory Points ranging mostly between 1 and 5.  It seems like it might have been a better idea to have some of the monsters have these same special abilities and tweak the VP down a notch or two instead.

In either case there isn't exactly anything wrong with the game as-is there are just some design choices that seem more odd vs. strictly clever or unique such that it's hard to say you would be missing out on anything 'new' not to have this in your collection.  At only ~$10 new, I do think it's a stronger title for those with slightly younger kids (Ages 6-8) as it definitely offers a game with more choices and strategies than many average children's games.  I don't know that it has much staying power though amongst older children or adults.

The one other thing of great  appeal with this game though is the dice and the way that they work.  They are altered six-sided dice (1,2,2,3,3,4 for the sides) and thus it can be taught that the average roll is a 2.5 such that 3 dice should beat a 7 and so on (With far more predictable odds given less swing in number range).  This sort of basic statistical analysis and approach offers some good learning opportunities should your child not already be familiar with it.  In that way its a great gateway game to other more complex games with similar analysis required.  I'm pretty sure that was the ultimate point and goal behind this games creation and in that regard it succeeds quite well and it's also a perfect fit for the Gamewright line should you be a fan.

A light tactical game with dice, which is my favourite combo of mechanics. I tried Rivet Wars, Seasons, Age of Wars, ... and fall in love just because how cool these games control luck through dice. I know there're many more out there, it's just their "dice" part is not much of itself. This game would definitely make your gaming day's dessert.

"Draak van een spel". 
This game is good when you like the theme, have a young age, and like throwing the dice.
For the rest it's a lot of luck that is going to decide whether you win this game or not. 
It just didn't get to me. It is dry and boring, no room for strategy, only making use of the card that opens before your nose, assemble enough cards and roll the dice.
Didn't even want to win this one time play, just wanted it to be over ASAP.

Ok the cards look nice, the box looks great, to end with a positive note.

Good for playing with my family including two younger boys, has enough of a fantasy feel to make it interesting for them. Nice quality of components (cards linen finish and the dice are well made too). Not meaty enough to play just with my partner. Edit: bumped it up half a point as it really gets the boys excited now, so more agreeable to pull it out and play.

Rating for children's game 
Bought this a whim because it was cheap (retails for $16) and the art is beautiful. It quickly became a favorite with my daughter's friends (ages 9-11 years old) and they all wanted their own copies. It is light, easy to learn, quick play with lots of dice rolling. It's rewarding to save up to take down one of the dragons, resulting in lots of cheering. It's still quite fun a light game for adults once in a while as well.

RATING: 6
This is now my 6 year old's favorite game. I am okay with that as it isn't a terrible game to play as adults. There is luck drawings the cards, and rolling the dice, but it's fun making the decision of pushing your luck or playing it safe. So many kid's game have no choices at all where this one does, makes this a great introductory game.

My wife and I play this head-to-head, and we play it as a family with our two girls (12 and 9). Everyone enjoys it! Don't you love it when the stars align like that? 

It's a solid game with a good mixture of chance and strategy and a fun theme. Trying to decide whether you will go for the easy targets and score the 3-point end game bonus, or save up for the big baddies is never an easy decision and will change based on a number of things including the strategy of your opponents. Finally having the perfect hand ready to tackle a dragon only to find out that the person in front of you has her hand ready too can make you facepalm. Getting a ton of 1 and 2 pointers only to discover that even with your 3-point bonus you're still going to lose can lead to the same. It's all part of the fun.

It's not something you will play for hours, but it's a great game to bring along to the cafe or take out as one of a handful of games for the evening. As I mentioned above, it's one of the games my whole family can happily play, and it's a regular part of our Panera Bag (the bag of games we take with us to Panera Bread and camp out with back in the corner for hours). :)

Not bad for a kids game. You basically utilize Poker hands in order to roll dice and defeat monsters. For a game that is very much on the simple end of things, this is a good one. I only wish that it was a little more difficult to defeat monsters. I do use a couple of house rules though. First is that whenever you draw cards, you draw 2 instead of 1 (Just to speed things up). Also, if someone defeats both dragons, I play to where everyone has an equal amount of turns. Usually this doesn't make too much of a difference, but I think it's worth doing. Really fun little game if you like Poker mechanisms and dice-rolling.

This is a great game for younger kids who don't know much about deck building games or dungeons and dragons, etc, etc.  

Teaches math, number sets and color sets.  

Probably my ONLY gripe with this game:  There are literally 2 dragons in the game.....  If you're gonna call the game:  Dragonwood and put a huge dragon on the cover of the game box with players in a forest (one may even say.... wood?....) you'd better have more than two dragons...

The cards are great quality and the artwork is well done.  The dice are VERY nice.

I'm sure kids younger than 6 would be able to play this game, but I've played w/ a 7, 10 and 13 year old and they all actually like the game.....

[b]Dragonwood[/b] was sold via auction 4/28/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I definitely enjoyed it enough to consider picking it up to play with my youngest daughter (she's 6 right now), but at the same time I'm not sure that I need a game that would end up having such a short shelf life. The game is inexpensive enough that it'll probably end up in our collection, especially since the theme will attract both my girls to play.

Quick update - I ended up getting this one because my youngest really wants to play daddy's grown up games. After one play it is a tentative hit. She needs a little help figuring out what each type of attack needs card wise, but she digs the theme. I'm sure it'll get a lot more plays in the coming year.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This would be a fun game to play with Lilly when she's a bit older (maybe 6 or 7), but is way too light for my other kids. It is a quick playying card game that includes some dice rolling. You are trying to defeat monsters using sets of cards ("x" of a kind or straights of like color) which allow you to roll a certain number of dice. There were enough different elements to keep the game fresh, but I would only recommend it for people with younger kids (6 - 8) or for gamers looking for a very light filler with some clever card play and dice rolling.[/i]

RATING: 7
Pros:
* Quick and simple
* Very nice components, although the Gamewright cards always seem to be the tiniest bit too large for my favorite card sleeves.
* The penalty for failing a roll is only a single card, which encourages a bit of push-your-luck.

Cons:
* Can feel slow while multiple players just build their hands back up (See variant notes below)
* Some rich-get-richer issues with the enhancement cards.
* Despite having a weak penalty for failure, it can be frustrating to fail three better-than-even rolls in a row and then throw down a set of four cards and a one time enhancement for a "sure thing" only to see this be the turn where you rolled high enough to only need two die. There are enough rolls in the game that everyone gets an equal part of the good and bad luck, but it can still feel like the Flying Spaghetti Monster is laughing at you (see variant notes below).

Variant:

After reading my comments on slow play, the designer geekmailed me and suggested a simple variant.

[q="kisgen"]The idea is to put 2 adventurer cards face up next to the draw deck. If a player wants to reload, he or she may either draw from the face-down draw deck or take one of the 2 face-up cards. If a player takes a face up card, it is replaced with another face up card. If a lucky ladybug appears face up, you just put it in the discard pile and put another card out.[/q]

= 2015-07-31

Played a few nights ago with the designer suggested variant. While we've only played this way once, we saw some immediate benefits:
* Made it easier to build up a useful combo, reducing both the number of failed rolls and desperate card draws.
* Made it possible to see what an opponent was going for, thus increasing the interaction somewhat.
* Introduced an additional meaningful choice.
* Adjusted the push-your-luck element somewhat from 'do the best with what I've got' to 'how long can I keep building up this hand before my opponent takes what I was after'.
* Shortened total game time without any negative impact on fun, tactics or strategy.

Two thumbs up for this variant.

I should also note that our prior games were also two player and we missed the rule about removing 12 cards from the monster deck in a two player game. When we played with the variant, we also corrected the size of the monster deck. With both of these changes, the game length feels just right.

= 2015-07-23

First play was slow. Between having multiple turns where all you're doing is drawing a single card back and forth and building up your hand for a "sure thing", the game can drag on and on. Our second play was much faster and more engaging. We took more risks and built up better combinations of enhancement cards that helped accelerate the game.

While there's no direct player interaction, you do always feel the pressure to push your luck to try to get a card before your opponent gets another shot at it.

[-]Might try a variant where you draw a card at the end of every turn. This would be in addition to the card you drew for your turn. The game is right on the edge of being too long for what it is and having extra draws might speed that up. We might then remove the end game condition of going through the deck twice.[/-] (see variant and updates above)

No rating yet. I can see us giving it a dozen plays, which puts it in a great price-per-play bracket.

This is a fairly simple game where you play cards to try to capture monsters.  Different monsters have different difficulty levels to capture.  Harder monsters net you more victory points.  

To capture a monster, you must play cards of the same rank, same suit or a run of one or more cards.  Depending on which of these you play, you have to beat a different score to capture the monster.  However many cards you play, you roll that many dice to try to beat the score.  The game comes with 6 sided dice that have a 1 through 4 on their faces.

There are also enchantments you can capture.  They don't give you any victory points, but they do give you either a one shot or continuous benefit when trying to capture a monster.

On your turn, you can try to either capture a monster or reload.  Reloading means drawing a card.  You often have to reload a number of times to get the right cards so you can play many of them when trying to capture a monster.

When you attempt to capture and are successful, you must discard all of the cards you play.  If you fail, you take the cards back into your hand and may discard any 1 card.

The game ends when both dragons have been captured.  When this happens, everyone counts the victory point of all of the monsters they captured and the one with the most points win.

I think it's a bit silly that after the two main dragons are gotten, the game is over.

But I think I'll throw away that dragon rule and just play til the deck is gone.

It's simple, it's quick, it's lucky. 
A simple push-your-luck game that's targeted towards kids, but can be enjoyed by adults. Nice family game, but not really for me. It's a little too luck-based for that.

Collect cards, weigh your odds and choose your target, then roll the dice. Carefully (or carelessly) planned gambling. What's not to like?

Great easy game to play with the kiddos. Helps teach about risk/reward/chance. My kiddos enjoyed it (age 7 and 9).

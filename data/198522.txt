It's love letter. It's fine, with super super light decision making. The Krieger mechanic is new/interesting, but it's not enough of a change to be worth looking twice at.

If you have to play Love Letter, play this one, and make dick jokes with Cyril.  Phrasing!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This isn't "just" Love Letter, it actually employs some new mechanics that make it a more interesting, fun game than the other versions.  We also have the Adventure time and vanilla (standard) Love Letter, and this one is, for whatever reason, the best version.  Not just a re-skin.  Makes going back to the other versions a bit of a letdown.

A mildly amusing take on Love Letter.  Love Letter is fun and this game is no exception.  Fans of Archer, however, will be mildly disappointed by the choices for the cards, I think.

Here's one with a theme I enjoy that's simple enough to pick up and play when there's some time but not really deep enough to enjoy 20 times in a row. It's a nice filler / game while others finish, but I wouldn't want it to be "The Game" that we play any given night.

RATING: 6
Sleeved. Probably the worst of the LL games. This tends to be even more random than the other games. The ability of Dr Krieger to just flat out win a round feels cheap.

While the theme doesn't speak to me they changed a couple of mechanics so it's not just a direct copy paste on the theme and I actually really truly enjoy the changes. This may actually replace love letter for me.

Love Letter with everyone's favourite dysfunctional spy agency, this game adds a twist, of course, with a "hidden identity card".  Each round has a hidden identity card (as normal) but this one plays a more integral part in the game.  It can swap in and out of players hands, if guessed with a Krieger (2) card, can win the player the round and can also be peeked at by Cheryl (4).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
So my favourite game is a filler, but, i could honestly have fun in a game night that just consisted of Archer. It really helps that i am a big fan of the show, but, i adored the original Love Letter and this is just a smarter variant with the cards having more powers than the original game. Easy to teach, fun to play,
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice changes to classic Love Letter card powers.  Strangely, this version seems to be the favorite of my kids (who thankfully know nothing about the theme).  As a fan of the show, it amuses me to hear my kids talking about Pam, Cheryl/Carol, Cyril, etc without knowing who they are.

I'm glad the card powers are different than the original game (and Batman); it makes me feel better about keeping them all in my collection.

Great for fans of the show, but also a few interesting twists on the standard version of [b]Love Letter[/b] - though this is the only alternative version I've played, so who knows, maybe the mods are more standard than the original at this point. Still one of my go-to pocket games to bring to a cafe or bar.

RATING: 7.5
Love Letter gets reworked with an Archer theme, and while there's one or two nice nods to the series, it's not so different that Love Letter lovers will be raving about how much they need this set to augment their existing base version.

PLUS: the theme fits perfectly
MINUS: not enough modifications to make it stand out differently

Being a fan of the TV show drew me into this version of Love Letter. I've played many versions Love Letter variants and this one is my favorite. 

The mechanics in this version are the best. I appreciate that the down (hidden identity) card now has a greater purpose than before. It fits the gameplay and spy theme appropriately. This version more so than others often ends before the draw pile is depleted. Note, most of the games I've played are 2 player games.

My favorite ruleset of the Loveletter family games, but the absolute worst graphic design.  Its the most generic of card templates and grates on me.  The art on the card is just fine, standard Archer fare.

The way this version lets you interact with the "discard" card is ingenious.  I hope some of the others pick up its innovation.

Essentially Love Letter, which is a game that bores me and overstays its welcome.  I like this Archer version slightly more because of the hidden identity mechanic and the fact that there is a way to win instantly that doesn't involve eliminating other players.

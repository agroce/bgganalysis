111021 Very pretty solitaire game with a couple 2P variants.  Worth purchasing for the art but the game play is quite good also!  Comes with several expansions, I found the one where you had to follow the order in opening the doors a an easier 2P game than the normal 2P game.

I played this a few times and didn't really get it. As I'm a person that assumes that +I+ have the problem, I give games second, third, fourth and more chances before I don't play them again -- which rarely happens. ;)

This title grew on me. It's a tense and surreal experience, quite like dreaming... which is fitting. There are interesting decisions to make all along, and I love how the mechanics and card balance create tension throughout -- and can result in a royal butt-kicking, or a narrow victory over the forces of dream-land.

There are several different ways to play Onirim, as expressed in three expansions to the game (all of which are included). This makes this a fantastic value which provides variety in gameplay for both two-player or solitaire gaming.

This title provides a very high enjoyment to price ratio... thus I highly recommend Onirim!

Relaxing and enjoyable pastime. Any initial rules confusion dissipated after 3 plays.

I'm going to make a '100 plays' attempt with this game.

A great alternative to solitaire, and no computer to fire up.

This game is good value - bought used from Canada, and even with freight was half of new Aussie price.

6/16/13 - Interesting Solo Game

Pretty decent little game. Hasn't blown my socks off, but I do enjoy playing it. It has easy set up, fast play time, and easy learning curve. The art is weird, but colorful. I need to play more with the keys, and the included expansions.

RATING: 8
A good fun card game that I can play on my own.  I just got it for a gift and already I've played it a number of times.  It's quick too, which is perfect for when I has to wait for someone (or have only a short amount of time to do things.)  I have the base game along with all the expansions.  

OK, I've now played the spell expansion, which makes the game harder to play (once you get the base game down, you will want to add an expansion to make it harder - or you will if you are like me and don't want to win all the time.)  It's a nice challenge, and doesn't make the game seem impossible.

I'm working through the Dark Towers expansion.  So far so good.  After a few more plays I'll add my thoughts.

All in all, I'm really pleased with the game.  I'm glad I own it.  I need more quick card games.  Especially solo card games.  Perfect way to pass time.

RATING: 2.5
The 2.5 rating is for the base game, whereas I would upgrade the rating to a solid 6 for Base + Glyphs expansion.  Glyphs adds a measure of forgiveness and reduces the chance of a frustrating "lose no matter what" game.

Own the Android app, not the physical game.  Played 100+ times.

It's neat, but the bad losses are extremely frustrating to me, when you guess incorrectly and go half the deck without opening a single door.  Or when you get all keys and moons to start the game.  This is part of solitaire games and "luck of the draw", yet it is absolutely frustrating when you know early on that there is nothing you can do to avoid a loss, but you have to play it out.

That's not anything against Onirim that isn't also against other solitaire games, and while Onirim does have some mechanics to mitigate bad luck, the presence of "You could lose no matter what, simply because the deck is in a certain order" plus the constant shuffling mean that I will not be owning a physical copy of this game.

RATING: 6
So far 3 games base solitaire.  A fine enough solitaire game.  At least 75% of the significant decision making is from the dream/nightmare cards - do I pitch my hand, pitch a completed door or punt for the first 5 cards off the deck?  I can see the strategy becoming very reductive, at least for the base game.  Since 3 of a color = a door, the trick is to discard keys judiciously in order to (hopefully) discard a dream/nightmare from the 5 cards drawn.  Extremely powerful towards the end of the game and very hopeful for the early-to-mid game.  While being rather luck driven, there are still decisions to be made and you might win or lose on those (or you might win or lose on luck).  All in all, a neat little solo game that plays fast and will interest me from time to time.  Worth the $15.

RATING: 8.2
This is a neat little thematic card game with a tight design that is simple enough to play with children.  It doesn't offer the deepest gaming experience, which should be a given, since it's a card game.  However, the only other significant drawback to the game is the amount of shuffling you have to do, as other people commenting on the game aptly point out.  We have played this quite a bit, and, at its price, it presents a good value.

UPDATE (05/15/2013): I just want to add that, for a card game, this entails a high degree of strategy.  Which door are you going for, how should you handle nightmares, etc.--these are all tough decisions.  The game really is quite clever, offering a perfect blend of luck and strategy for a card game, in my opinion.  I'm bumping this up a couple of points, from an even 8 to 8.2.

Onirim is ... okay. But just okay isn't enough reason to hold onto it. The theme is cool.  You are lost in a dream world and trying to find keys to escape.

I recently rediscovered Onirim after doing some work on arranging the games in the game room. (Consolidated four shelves of card games down to 3.5, moving in some card game books -- not bad.) I only played it a few times when I got it.

Today I played four times. This is a fun little game -- all about weighing the odds of seeing the cards you need. I think there's a lot more there than I thought at first.

Looking forward to trying with expansions, and trying the 2-player semi-cooperative version.

RATING: 8
The best solo game. Small footprint, quick set up and playing time, expandability and the tension lasts until the end of the game.

Down(up?)graded to the first edition because I didn't like the second edition inserts and 3 expansions are more than enough for me. Love being able to start playing just opening the box. Compact to carry too.

RATING: 7.7
This is a card game that can be played solo or co-op with two players. The art is really strange and might be a turnoff for some people, but I find it really appealing. The cards do make for a game with a lot of luck and randomness, but the entire game is abut managing that luck and randomness as much as possible in order to create sets and find the doors needed to escape the dream. I am a sucker for super portable games that take less than twenty minutes to play. I love this game solo and can't imagine it ever leaving my collection.

Initial Impression: There's an interesting puzzle hidden in this small box. Although the rules are simple, the solving the puzzle looks as if its going to take a few tries. Immediately after playing the game I wanted another go at it. I can see myself playing this game as a nightcap to scratch the solitaire itch before bedtime. The watercolory artwork does a spectacular job of pulling you into the dreamscape.

If you have any interest in solo games, this is worth your time playing at least once.

I love this game, the only objection that I have with Onirim is the frequent shuffling that breaks the game flow. I have played the base game and the books of steps lost and found, enough to have felt in love with it and awaking my interest to explore the rest of the Oniverse titles, the next one is going to be Equilibrion which I ordered yesterday.

After getting the android App, even my 5 years old daughter felt in love with it. I'm surprised that she seems to understand the rules as most of the times she takes the same decisions that I'm thinking that are the best.

I totally recommend this game and there are (in this edition) three expansions to keep things interesting for a while.

I'm considering purchase the second edition and collect all Oniverse serie.

Played a few games, a fun little diversion.  I plan to take it with me on a long plane trip coming up - it will fit on the tray because it's compact and give me something to do.  We'll see if it stands up to the test of time then.

UPDATE:
It's a fun little diversion and does indeed fit on a plane tray.

May 2013 - played my first Tower game and got crushed. I really enjoy this game, even when I lose (and it can be frustrating, but it's hard to get too worked up about it - must be the zen artwork!). This is a game I'm surprised I like. For something that's basically themed solitaire, it has a nice narrative each time I play. Need to play more often.

June 2012 - tried the Book of Steps Lost and Found, and it really takes the game (specifically, decision-making) to the next level. VERY fun.

05-FEB-2012 - a milestone; my first win :)

I'm definitely not a fan of traditional solitaire/patience games. I also don't usually like solitaire games of any kind (e.g. Roll Thru the Ages, etc). So why did I get Onirim? Well, it was cheap, and highly recommended by a couple of people whose tastes I respect.

After one play, I'm quite liking it. Sure it's random and there is a lot of shuffling (practice...), but it's enjoyable and there is quite a bit of tension hoping not to draw a Nightmare. I foresee this getting regular play for when I need a quick gaming fix and there are no opponents around.

RATING: 7
Easy-to-learn but challenging solitaire game. The limitations on card placement and the varied actions possible with the key cards provide some interesting decisions, and some you wouldn't expect from just looking at the game. Often deciding when you want to shuffle the deck (with a door or nightmare card) is one of the most important decisions you can make, using a key to deliberately place a door or nightmare card higher in the deck (and thus change a bad situation or even discard a bad hand). Quite an interesting solo game, good enough that I am interested in trying the sequel. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Reminds me of Klondike or something similar.  I like the built in expansions, and would probably try them out if I could beat the game in the first place.

Update:  I've gotten good at the game now, and have beaten the book expansion.  Moving on to the other ones.  This is entertaining for me as a solo activity.

Second Update:  I've beated all of the expansions in the box.  This is a fun solo activity that will probably always live on my shelf (due to price and footprint).

RATING: 8
Two player cooperative games are rare. Onirim is a bit too much dependent on the luck of the draw, but, as there are not too many other choices and the short game length always allows for a second try when luck is not on your side, I still think this is an eight.

(Based on the basic game)

Cute game. I must try the included expansions!

There is definitely a lot of luck here, but for something so quick it doesn't really matter. It's a fun little journey.

The Nightmare card effects are a bit weird. Some (at least, based on my plays so far) seem clearly worse than others... why would you ever choose to lose a door?

I could see how this could wear a bit thin and just turn into a bland "draw, didn't get the card I wanted, wait to draw again" feeling... but it seems short enough that it might not get to that.

The artwork is very nice, but I found myself wishing it went a bit further. More unique art for the labyrinth cards might have evoked the theme a better, because it very quickly just becomes "I'm looking for green cards."

I also wish there was more interactivity with the co-op game. In both our games, one of us got our four doors WAY ahead of the other person and just had to sit there idly by with no way of assisting the other player. Made it feel a bit pointless.

Wondering why they didn't add a Vs. game - to see who could get all the doors the fastest. I suppose with a game this luck-based though it would be irritating to lose to another person for no other reason than luck of the draw.

RATING: 7
Clever co-op card game for 1 or 2 people.

I get a Pandemic vibe from it, collecting sets and cashing them in, all the while you're thinning the deck, bringing the game closer and closer to it's end. Nightmare cards lurk just below the surface, bringing a high level of tension to each new draw. 

There are a few fiddly things about the rules, general flow is interrupted with all the shuffeling and a few encounters send you looking for further clarification, but after a few plays, it clicks.

Challenging, but not impervious. General strategies emerge after a few plays. Utilizing the key cards to reveal future cards better your odds significantly.

The water color art style fits the theme perfectly.

So, hmmmm - I beat this game on my first solo play with lots of time/cards remaining. It makes me think I did something wrong. I was just bumbling along and I won. This really takes the allure out of this game for me. I should be crushed on the first solo game, not cruising to victory! In fact, I was upset that I won - 'that can't be right!'

Either the stars were perfectly aligned, or I'm an idiot who cannot read instructions. Either way, I will play again but my motivation to do so right now is low.

CO-OP

I really like that the game comes with a number of expansions straight out of the box - This allows you to tailor the difficulty to your suiting. One of our go-to 2 player games. Difficulty can be tailored to your liking, similar to pandemic - Including a version where you aren't allowed to talk.

I'm surprised that BGG has this as best played by 1 - I think it really shines as a couples game

You can play this online without any expansions by going to http://www.underbrush.ca/ and selecting easy. Hard/Master etc. are fan variants of the game but not the same as the expansions that come with Onirim.

This is the only 2 player cooperative board game I've played. It seems quite well balanced. In the session we played (a number of games over about 3 hours) we won and lost about the same number of games, and they were all close - down to the last few cards on the wins, and very close to a win on the losses.

Nagyon fain játék ez! Kell 1-2 játék mire belejön az ember és meglátja a győzelmi lehetőségek sokaságát - mert egyre többet lehet ezekből észrevenni. No persze a szerencse fontos tényező lehet, és zavaró a kártyák folytonos újrakevergetése, de 1 és 2 fővel is gyors, izgalmas, végletekig kiélezett a harc a rémálmok ellen!
További pozitívum a 3 kiegészítő (melyekkel egyelőre nem játszottunk). Aki szeret egymagában is eljátszani (én egy 100 km-es vonatút alkalmával 7 partit lenyomtam), vagy szeret két fővel a játék ellen nyomulni, annak nagyon ajánlott!

Update: a kiegészítők annyi új taktikai elemet visznek a játékba, hogy ez ebben a kategóriában az egyik legjobb, alkotás!

Fun little solitaire (or 2-player co-op) game with great artwork and a very low price.  It's easy using the mini-expansions included to tweak the difficulty to the razor's edge: the games that I've won in my first few plays were accomplished with five or six cards left in the deck.  Looking forward to giving the co-op mode a try, and to seeing if additional expansions wind up coming out.

Pretty good overall, but gameplay has kind of an awkward flow to it.  The pace is at times fairly speedy and smooth, but things screech to a halt every time you're forced to shuffle, resolve a nightmare, rearrange cards off the top of the deck, etc.  

Both aspects work well enough on their own (very well, even), but the combination of the two results in a somewhat disjointed feel.  It's neither a game you can mindlessly repeat over and over, nor one you can fully submerse yourself in.

Still, for the price, there's definitely a lot of game here.

It's a card game that feels like the basic premise of Pandemic distilled down to the simple concept of bad cards being cycled continuously back into the deck.  But here the good cards may get discarded from the game - making those bad ones come more fast and furious.

You are trying to get all the door cards (in 4 colors), which requires 3 cards of a color in a row, or having a key when a door is revealed.  Nightmare cards force you to discard when you don't want to - causing a lot of stress!

What's really unique about this game is that it's primarily a solo game, but has a strong 2-player variant.  A great time-killer that you can stick in your pocket and take anywhere.  My main complaint is just the ruleset, which was unnecessarily confusing.  It took a full game to get underneath the rules and discover how simple it is.

This is an amazing solo card game. Very addictive. I haven't even tried the expansions (but I will be very, very soon) but I can see they will make a great base game even better!

I'm also looking forward to the 2-player game.

EDIT: Have played with all the expansions and one game with all three. This is one of the best solo games I have ever played!

I tried and tried to like this one, but after five games I just couldn't take it anymore. I bought it mainly because of the very nice artwork and the really positive reviews here on BGG. This is definitely the last time I trust the BGG ratings. I played the following expansions solo: 2x The basic game, 2x The Book of Steps Lost And Found, 1x Dark Premonitions and Happy Dreams. (I won two of the games and lost three)

The game is really luck based and it doesn't offer any kind of positive feedback. It's just about minimizing the losses and hoping that the next card wont be a nightmare card. This kind of combination just doesn't make an enjoyable game. The expansions don't seem to make the game any less luck based, just harder. This was pretty disappointing.

The constant shuffling adds to the "punishment" :) (In Dominion you've just added something new and positive to your deck and you're eager to see how the new card works with the rest of the deck. In Onirim the shuffling is just a chore. So you can't really compare the amount of shuffling between these two)

I've always enjoyed the Z-Man releases, but this was a massive disappointment.

I have only played the 1-player version on my phone, but really don't like it.  I played it 6 or 7 times just to make sure I wasn't missing anything but never really enjoyed it.  The theme is very thin (or non-existent) so it's basically an abstract game.  But none the decisions seem that meaningful, which means I didn't get any better at the game even though I played it a half dozen times.  I know there is a following for this one, but I'm not sure what people are getting out of it.

This one is pretty neat for a solo game. It plays/feels almost like a multiplayer coop game. The two-player variant also works fine.

This comes across as one of those games where you don't really have any hard decisions to make.  The problem is, those Nightmare cards will penalize you no matter what you do.  So, even if you play smart, be prepared to be constantly annoyed by those Nightmare cards.  Not being rewarded for playing well (and often penalized for any action) means this game, for me, is not any fun.  I don't have any plans on ever coming back to Onirim.

Played this tonight with my husband and I have to say, it's great!  So many different things appealed to me in this game: it's short, yet challenging, you will lose more than you win, table talk is encouraged (and perhaps abused a bit too easily in this game), the artwork on the cards is wonderful.  Most importantly, after playing a few rounds, I felt like my husband and I had a great night of gaming and we didn't even play for an hour!  

Update:  A few weeks ago I played a couple of rounds with someone else and was shocked to learn that I had been playing the game incorrectly.  My husband and I did not draft our hands at the beginning of the game from a face up, common pile.  Setting up your teams' starting hand makes a huge difference on the game play.  As a result, I find the game to be not as enjoyable as I first thought.

I gave this a shot with the solo, basic 2 player and door expansions before I realized the only thing I liked about the game was the artwork and packed it up. If you're in need of a solo card game, it'll do, but it isn't a lot of fun.

A small mean game that I mainly bought for solo play, and which my wife discovered and loved. We always play it coop now, adding in expansions from time to time. There's not much meat to it, but feels compelling anyway because of the constant threat of the nightmares in the deck. Good game and love the artwork.

Onirim was interesting but the amount of shuffling in the game reminds me of a deck building game. That is to say: infuriating enough that I will get rid of it regardless of the good aspects of the game.  I should mention that I have only played this one solo.  I think it's a solid game with a lot of variety in how you can mix and match the different expansions that are included with the game.  With it's low price point, this is worth a purchase to see if you like it.  I guarantee that I would by this if a digital version of the game was released with a decent implementation.

RATING: 7
There is tons of replayabilility here. The included expansions give it all kinds of variety. Gets a slight ding for the rule book which is unclear in places, as well the learning curve, which shouldn't be as bad as it is, but could be fixed with a minor re-do of the rule book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
To start with this was very moreish, fun to learn and play alone. However, and this may be my own weakness, but it feels out of my control. The moves are generally obvious apart from how to deal with the negative nightmare cards, and I guess I prefer choosing good options rather than just damage limitation. So it's possible I'm missing some insight, but this game just seems limited to me, started fun but grew frustrating fast.

WAY more fun than playing solitaire. Great "beat the deck" feel and refreshing artwork. While this "can" be played with two, it is at it's core a solitaire game. Beware: fingers get sore shuffling after a game or two.

This game was a good time killer years ago, but with the invention of mini games on a smartphone, it has less purpose. I decided to sell it and keep Friday as the better solitaire game.

Onirim is a nice little filler game that you can play solo or with 2 players. Though the only interaction in the co-op mode are the community-cards that can be used by both players, and the decisions that you make when you have to deal with drawn nightmares. It has nice artwork and plays very fast, and as a nice bonus has already 3 expansions built in for some long term motivation.

RATING: 6
(As of [b]8[/b] plays) A trippy little solo/cooperative card game with fantastic art. On first glance it seems simplistic in the extreme (draw a card, play a card, yawn), but the choices involved in resolving Nightmares really ratchet up the tension to the point that I was starting to feel a bit paranoid. Have just started adding in the first expansion, which makes things even better.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] Fortunately I'm not constrained to solo gaming at the moment, so this hasn't seen much play. However, it is one of the better solo games I have come across, and worth revisiting.

An extremely unfun cooperative game that felt a bit like chutes and ladders: the card game. The main mechanism for bad things happening, at least in the base game, was to lose progress you've already made. That doesn't evoke the fear of a nightmare - more the annoyance of being trapped in a traffic jam. Add the chore of constant shuffling and it's even worse. The art is pretty awesome, at least.

Szóló, illetve 2 játékosos coop kártyajáték. Elég ritka a témája: egy álomból kell kijutnunk színes ajtókon keresztül, miközben rémálmok nehezítik az utunkat. Maga a játék elég absztrakt ahhoz, hogy ez a téma inkább csak az elég elvont látványvilágon jöjjön át. Egy speciális szett gyűjtögetésről van szó, némi csavarral. Elég nehéznek tűnik, mert eddig 6-ból csak egyszer sikerült nyerni.

Onirim seems like a well-tuned card-drawing coop (or solo game; I don't much play solitaire but I don't expect the experience to differ much from the cooperative game). The base game comes down to the wire most of the time, and it's nice that you can mix and match the various expansion modules to your heart's content.

It does exhibit the same problems I have with many other cooperative games, namely that the underlying mechanism is too prominent to really make for an interesting game. The extraordinary amount of shuffling required in Onirim doesn't help with that, either. As a card-counting exercise it's well done, but that's rarely something I'm looking for.

RATING: 7.8
I'm still trying to solve this game. Very challenging, and when you start to get the hang of the base game you can add in some of the included expansions. However, it's a little long and a little dry, so it doesn't hit the table very often.

RATING: 2
Little more than a random card game.
Discarding keys for prophecies can sometimes allow players to discard nightmares or might just force much needed labyrinth cards. Nightmares sometimes cause chain reactions and can do so at the start of the game with no warning. Nightmares can just as easily do no damage to players by only putting 2 or even 1 labyrinth from the top of the deck into the discard pile.
Even beyond all of this, the game often has players looking through the deck or setting cards aside and shuffling them back into the deck, putting 90% of this game's playing time into shuffling.
The interaction that exists in non-verbal communications between cooperating players is interesting in theory, but occurs so rarely besides the obvious plays in this wholly chance-based system.

RATING: 7.814
Solo fun with a pack of 76 cards. No messy setup or over complex rules. Feel that this is a bit like (but better than) Klondike, in that you have some influence but also need a little luck. Also a nice bit of angst occurs whenever you get a Nightmare card.  Card graphics are unusual, but work well is a slightly strange abstract way. And when you win, you do feel a bit 'cats whiskers', in that it wasn't just the game mechanically playing you, but you managed to beat the system. Yes, you do shuffle a bit, but for me that is part of the joy of a solo card game - It's like a cow chewing It's cud between thoughts! Rating is a good 7, and it also comes with expansions for when the base game gets tiring, so with more games I might even bump the rating higher (Aug 2013). UPDATE: Played as 2 player coop, and that works well.  Elevated to a worthy 8 (Sept 14).  UPDATE: So far the best small solo card game I have, but do I really want to continue to play small solo card games?  Still, it has been good (rating 7.814, Dec 2015).

RATING: 7
A very pleasing solo game that casts you as a Dreamwalker, going through the labyrinth of dreams and avoiding nightmares, trying to find all the doors to lead through the maze.  A push-your-luck sorta game, with tension built in through the random appearance of Nightmares, that have to be dealt with.  There's a lot of shuffling involved, but it's an easy-breezy enough of a game that it doesn't concern me.  A real nice touch is three included mini-expansions which really help the replay value. Very straightforward with a nice level of decision making. Unfortunately by the near-end of the game you might have already lost without knowing it and you'd be able to play better if you kept strict track of which cards you have already discarded. But then that would take away from the flow of the game. I bought this game the week it came out just based on looks alone and I'm glad I got to be there for the beginning of a great series of solo games by Shadi Torbey.

What an odd little game.  The Basic game is fairly easy.  I won handily the first time.  There is a large amount of shuffling, but that really isn't too annoying.  It's a nice, relaxing game with some challenge so far.

Basic Game - 5/10

Book of Steps - This variant makes the game much more difficult.  In my first attempt, I needed one more blue card, but ran out of cards in the deck.  It definitely makes the game more difficult and slightly more interesting.  GAAARRRR...difficult and frustrating - exactly what a solitaire game should be.  I wouldn't want to play it if it was too easy. 7/10

It's a solo game (playable with two) that's almost as good as Klondike. Gripes? There's shuffling almost every turn. If you need practice shuffling this may be a plus, but you'll probably grow tired of it. The blue and green look almost identical (hint: look for symbols in the card art). The suit icon could have been printed on both top and bottom, so a wider fan wouldn't be necessary. What's the plus? The artwork! The hazy watercolor/gouache (?) paintings look as spooky as the hall through which you're walking.

Onirim is a fascinating, suspenseful, challenging solo game. I haven't played it as a two-player game yet. It took me a while to develop a strategy, and a lot of the time I lose within the last turn or two because of an unlucky draw. But when I do win, I feel very satisfied because the battle was difficult.

From email to someone: "I picked it up on a whim at a booth at Origins last year, never having heard of it. The art is what struck me. Played it the whole way home on the plane. Wonderful, elegant, and quietly dramatic gameplay with lovely art. Only complaint is that there's a lot of shuffling and reshuffling, but that becomes part of the solitaire rhythm of the experience after a while. As for losing interest, I indeed put it down for a long while after getting good enough to win consistently, but recently just picked it up after telling a friend about it, and it's just as fun as ever. (Also I tend to go on short-lived "runs" with games anyhow.) And there are 2 (or 3?) mini-expansions included, and I'm just getting into those. For what it is, which is a very light solitaire card game with great atmospheric art, there's a lot there. Also haven't tried it co-op, which I'd like to with my wife at some point."

I view Onirim as a solitaire game, primarily. The two-player version isn't as good, in my opinion.

I love Onirim's very surreal "dreamscape" theme, and the beautiful, evocative artwork to match. It's a puzzle-y game where you're trying to play sequences of cards that will unlock eight dream doors. This would be quite easy if not for the nightmare cards, which force you to choose one of several nasty effects whenever they appear. All of this fits together wonderfully, creating a smooth game with some tricky decisions. The tension level is good, with lingering uncertainty about whether you'll be able to achieve victory before you burn through the deck.

What really pushes Onirim over the top is all the different modes of play that allow you to tweak the difficulty and complexity, and throw a different spin on the decisionmaking. The game comes with three modular expansions that can be added to the game alone or in combination. And in case that isn't enough, each of these expansions has a standard and a hard difficulty. I count 27 different ways to play Onirim - and that's without even considering the two-player versions.

That's a lot of game for about $8 to $10. If you have any interest in solitaire games, you should investigate Onirim. My only warning is that there's a lot of shuffling during the game. I don't find the shuffling to be onerous, since you're usually just mixing in one or two cards to an already-randomized deck. But some players may disagree.

A fun little puzzle of a game that plays solo interestingly and quickly enough to justify it's existence.  The expansions give it some flexibility of gameplay and some interesting challenges to keep things a bit more fresh.  Recommended as a way to burn time and relax.

The shuffling can be a bit of a drag but I like how the strategies ebb and glow over the course of the game.  The art is beautiful and builds on the theme and once you have learned the rules the lack of text makes them better.

RATING: 6
I like the theme, the components (card art) and the simplicity of the rules. It could be a solitaire or even 2-player game that I would pick up fairly often.

There is just one problem: too much shuffling! There are streaks during which every turn (which is really short in itself - involving only playing or discarding a card, followed by drawing a card) results in having to pick up the deck in order to shuffle just a few cards back into it or to pick it up to locate some card - and then shuffle it.

It gets to a point at which you can't be bothered to pick up the deck another time, which leaves the lingering impression of not wanting to pick up the game again. Too bad.

Álmodtam egy világot magamnak, itt állok az „ajtói” előtt….
Társasjátékos világban ritka, de léteznek kimondottan egy személyes gémek (kifejezetten szeretem azon játékokat, amelyeket egy személy is tud játszani és ezt sikerül normálisan megoldani). A játékkal kapcsolatban legtöbbet hallható szó a „keverés” ugyanis itt elég sokszor kell a lapokat megkeverned az amúgy elég gyors partid során. Ha ez már eleve nem tetszik neked, akkor a játékélmény sem fog ezen sokat javítani és kerüld el.
Jómagam a játék első kiadásával rendelkezem, amelyhez csak 3 kiegészítő járt és azóta már megjelent egy csillivilli változat is több kieggel.
A játék során Álomföldén barangolva megpróbálod megtalálni, sőt kinyitni mind a 8 kaput és így józan ésszel visszatérni pihepuha ágyikódba csak a szépre, jóra emlékezve. Persze a gonosz rémálommanók a nyomodban (paklidban) vannak, így ez nem könnyű (Nem is lehetetlen. Általában az alappal 3 játékból 1-2 simán nyerhető, így kicsit túlzónak érzem a játék fórumain megtalálható nagyon nehéz jelzőt).
Alapvetően a kezedben lévő 5 kártyából próbálod a legtöbbet kihozni. A lapok 4-féle színben (piros,zöld, kék és barna) és 3-féle szimbólummal ellátva (nap, hold és kulcs) találhatóak a pakliban.
A játék során kártyát játszol ki vagy dobsz el, majd húzol és szembenézel a felhúzott lap esetleges különleges hatásaival.
Kijátszás során az egymás mellett lehelyezett lapokon nem lehet azonos szimbólum. Ha sikerül 3 egyforma színű lapot így lepakolnod, akkor a pakliból kikeresheted az ennek megfelelő színű ajtót és a 8-ból már meg is van egy. Másik lehetőséged ajtó megszerzésére, akkor van, amikor ajtó kártyát húzol fel és a kezedben van egy olyan színű kulcs kártyád is. Ekkor ismét bezsákolsz egy olyan színű ajtót, haladva a győzelem felé.
Kijátszás speciális formája egy kulcs lap felhasználása, amellyel a húzópaklid legfelső 5 lapját megnézheted, egyet kötelezően eldobsz belőle, majd a többi négyet általad választott sorrendben visszateszed (így tudsz megszabadulni a rémálommanóktól is).
Viszont, ha rémálom lapot húzol (ebből 10 van a pakliban) választanod kell a lehetséges büntetések közül.
Ha elfogy a húzópaklid és nem sikerül a 8 ajtót addigra megtalálnod, a játékot elveszetted, azonban annak rövidsége miatt már jöhet is a következő leosztás.
A korábbi kiadás 3 kiegészítőjével a fenti játékmenetet lehet további variánsokkal gazdagítani, ha már meguntad azt. Sőt ezeket még egymással is ötvözheted, ha szeretnéd.
Könyvek Lépteinek elvesztése és megtalálása: komoly nehezítés, hogy a 8 ajtót immár sorendben kell megtalálni, viszont ebben segíthet neked 3 varázslat, amelyet a dobópakli lapjaiból tudsz kifizetni.
A Tornyok: plusz feladatként a játékban szereplő 4 szín tornyait is fel kell fedezned, sőt meg is védened a törékeny építményeket a rémálmoktól.
Sötét Előjelek és Boldog Álmok: kellemes kis nehezítés, bár a különböző előjel kártyák hatásai eléggé kiegyensúlyozatlanok.
A játékot lehet 2 személyes kooperatív módban is játszani, amit még nem próbáltam.
Maga a játék összességében korrekt 1 fős pasziánsz, az általam ismert 1 fős egyszerűbb játékok legjobbika. Az már más kérdés, hogy társasjáték lényege, hogy társas elfoglaltság legyen.

RATING: 7.25
This quick playing solitaire is a hand/card management game, with a certain number of penalty cards which must be planned for/managed to win.

Basically, the goal is to accumulate the 8 doors into dream to escape the deam maze.  There are 3 different corridor cards in the basic set, and addditional cards in the 3 expansions (included). Each Type of corridor card has different symbols; if you can play three cards of a color without matching symbols card to card, then you can search the deck to recover a door, reshuffling afterwards.

The penalties are Nightmares which require you discard a number of cards, or more powerful cards, even a door, to defeat. planning on managing Nightmares while retaining the cards needed to win doors is the trick.

It makes a quick and enjoyable little game, with lots of upside difficulty possible with the expanions, beyond the base game which is enjoyable in itself.

Not a heavy game, but for solitaire something which requires thought and planning, and doesn't burn a lot of time. Lots of virtues here - a 7 to start, with some upside as I explore/combine additional expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
I like The Towers expansion to Onirim very much, and use it almost all the time to make the base game a better challenge.

The Towers are additional goals which must be aligned, with one of each of the 4 colors, to restablize Dream before the sleeper exits.

They are fragile- Nightmares destroy one Tower card if a set of four has not been attained- and also powerful, allowing preview/realignment options that give better control of the Onirim deck.

The added challenge as well as added control makes this an almost required expansion for me; Onirim becomes a better game with this expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have played the Dark Premonitions expansion to Onirim a couple of times, but generally don't bother with it.

Unlike The Towers and The Books expansions, this expansion adds significant challenge/penalties with less added control to the base Onirim deck.  For me The Towers are a sufficient added challenge, while I can certainly see others liking this expansion, it's more likely to be those loving HELL-level Ghost Stories than the average joe gamer.

Glad to have it with the 1st edition, but I don't care for this expansion as much as either of the other two included expansions.

I liked The Books... expansion to Onirim alright, and have played it a couple of times, but generally don't bother with it.

Like The Towers this expansion adds challenge as well as some control to the base Onirim deck.  For me The Towers are a sufficient added challenge, but this one played reasonably well, and I can certainly see others liking this expansion.

Glad to have it with the 1st edition, anyway.

Umh. I am definitely not a solo player, but I thought I'd give the concept a chance. Played three times, which didn't take very long. Lost the first play, gained experience through that and won the next two easily. That's about as many times as I am likely to try this. It might be more interesting with two players, but essentially, playing alone put me off the game. 
As for the artwork, I really love the box cover. Some cards are also cool, but the overall sight of the cards was a disappointment. They don't come together to form anything in my mind, so it felt very abstract.

Would be rated higher if it was less abstract, but for a small card game, it's great.

Update: The app fired the physical version of this game for me. Playing is a lot more enjoyable without all the manual shuffling.

Recently started to play a bit more solo. Happy to have found Onirim. It's tense, sets a good mood and plays quick. I can even play a round while waiting for my wife to join me for a game in the game room.
First win came only after 6 plays. That's great; means it's not too easy, and the included expansions should give it some more legs.

Its a very nice theme, the art is very cool, its portable, fast and very easy to learn, BUT the theme does not really come through for me anyway, as you just draw, draw, discard, discard until you get the sets you need then play them, its very mechanical and repetitive, and the few times you do make a decision they seem pretty arbitrary since luck has the biggest influence on whether or not you will succeed. 

Note only played base game solo which I would rate a 3, I read rules to all expansions and would rate 4 (thought it could be slightly better than I think but 5 most likely for me) hence 3.5. I am no solo game expert, don't play them hardly at all and have only played a few of them but for a similar game that does basically everything (except art) better check out FRIDAY.

Curious co-op in which you're trying to collect all the "doors" before you run through the custom deck of cards.  The "ghosts" come along to interfere with you at the most inopportune times.  Mostly, you're trying to build sets in order to retrieve the doors from the deck, but if a door turns up when you have the key in hand, you can collect it immediately.  There are two of each of the 4 doors, and each player has to collect one.  The luck of the draw comes into play, but there are enough options that it feels like there are meaningful choices along that can affect the outcome.

Quite fun solitaire game. One of the two first solitaire games that I added to my collection (the other being Space Hulk - Death Angel) and I enjoy this one a bit more than SH - DA - primarily because the box is smaller, comes with some expansions, and I really enjoy the short playtime and when I lose I don't feel like crap compared to SH - DA.

The concept is really neat - and the art is fantastic. The only negative that I have is all the shuffling! You can bet this one will go traveling with me.

I find it relaxing and evocative nonetheless; just think it's overrated on bgg.

Is it better than solitaire? Of the basic game, I'd have to say no. But with the included expansions, this definitely goes well beyond solitaire in terms of the decisions to be made. The rules take a bit of getting used to. The expansions are not really all that intuitive, but they do enhance the game greatly. For those who are interested in this tidbit, I've found that your airplane tray will only fit the game with one expansion max. To play with more, you need to spill over to the seat next to you. Trust me.

Great for plane/train trips or to just carry around if you're bored. For such a simple game, it does force you to make some hard decisions.

Underwhelming after the first game. It didn't feel like I had many choices. I'm willing to play it more though and revise the rating.

UPDATE: Using the book of steps lost and found increased the meaningful decisions. This isn't an expansion, the game is clearly incomplete without this.

I'm not really a fan of solo games, since it seems like you should just do something else or play a video game. While I appreciate the difficulty of the game and the originality of the game system, it just doesn't seem very compelling.

The artwork though is very nice and should be commended - I'd like to see more games with artwork like this.

A really good and interesting solitaire game. I like the layout of the game and am fond of the idea of having this with me when travelling. Comments for expas added in case they are removed from the database.

The Books of Steps Lost and Found:
I like this the best out of the three expansions and it's the one I'm most likely to use. The order for which to find the doors genuinely adds challenge to the game and the spell books give you interesting options throughout the game.

Dark Premonitions and Happy Dreams:
Happy dreams are very powerful especially as they trigger by drawing them, you don't have to play them. Drawing them early on might actually make the game a walk in the park. Adding only happy dreams to the base game is a good idea, if the game fels too difficult. The concept of dark premonitions is a reasonable addition, but feels also a bit forced and some are definitely much darker than others.

The Towers:
Least interesting of the three base expansions. The towers might make it hard for you if you draw a lot of them in the early game, but if you don't, it won't necessarily be that difficult to play around them. Thankfully they are multiuse cards.

An enjoyable solo diversion. Once you figure out how to use the keys the game gets easier. The expansions let you level this up. 

I rated this low at first but it has slowly risen because I find myself playing it a lot. I don't get to game as much as I would like, and this hits a sweet spot for me: an interesting solo game with no setup time, plays quickly, offers a good challenge, and travels well. I sometimes play things on a tablet but I usually prefer the tactile nature of cardboard, and this is one of my quick go-to solo games.

2016-05-23 - 5.5 - I'm not sure if I get that game. After two plays it's OK, but really nothing special. I didn't try any of the mini expansions yet. There is a big advantage that as a solo game it takes 15 minutes and doesn't require setup almost at all. I will give it a try again probably.

I had enough fun with this game and don't feel like to play it again.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar: (10 plays November 2017)
At the beginning I thought I wouldn't like this weird game. Now I can't stop playing this everyday. It is super quick to play and there is little to think about but yet it grabs me strong. I am not hesitant to give high rating on this which is but strange because I do like it. See if I play over 20 plays then I will give this 8.

:star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar: (15 plays November 2017)
Well it is definitely an addictive solo game but after playing 15 games I feel it is but too easy and but pointless to play. I don't feel like to keep this anymore.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar: (20 plays November 2017)
And I was wrong. This is really addictive and I have kept playing this whenever I could. I think the reason why it kept me playing was because of duration of the game was just right and the level of stress was suitable for a casual game moments. I don't know exactly why but I keeps playing this...

My 10 rating is for playing it co-op. I'd only give it a 6 for solo though because I very much dislike shuffling and there's a lot of it in this game and I feel it also loses a lot of the strategy that exists in the co-op game. Co-op, however, it's an absolutely brilliant game. I love that you're looking at how best you can help your partner and with the silent play option I love how you're hoping that they realize exactly what you need.

I think this is a play it to understand it game.  But the idea is you play a simple card game as a coop game.  You are given options to discard cards from your deck to avoid losing good cards in your hand.  The fun comes from trying to meet your objectives without accidentally making the wrong decision and discarding cards you need.  I think this game is fun.  It is probably just as good a solitaire game as it is Co-op.  Though it is fun, I feel other co-op games do a better job of making your decisions exciting.

RATING: 7
The base game is interesting and very pretty, and is a quick and amusing solitaire experience.  But I think it lacks depth without the expansions.  Most of the decisions to be made seem obvious to a veteran gamer.  But it looks like the expansions add quite a bit of challenge and creates more difficult decisions.  Time will tell; I've stuck to the base game so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Refreshing theme and artwork, but way too random. Often the result of a game does not rely on one's decisions or some kind of "conscious risk" - it's just the card order in the draw pile that makes it impossible to win.

Nice card game for solo. The basic game is too easy but I find that with the expansions you can tailor it to your liking well enough.

Good depth for a game so light; you must learn to assess what you have accomplished relatively to the cards still in your deck (what could happen to you).

I don't feel I need to mix any of the three mini-expansions included, yet.

Warning: really really heavy on shuffling!

I have only tried the base game so far. Winning the basic game is not particularly easy.

I have to rate this a 10 because this was my first solitaire game and it started it all. My realisation that there are actual games that can be played solo (I know it sounds crazy that this was something I didn't know at the time), my newly inflamed love for Board- and Cardgames, my discovery of BGG and more started with this little gem.

For the game:
It is beautiful, simple and at the same time very challenging with lots of small but difficult decisions. I love the artwork and the card design and I like how I can adjust my game with the inbox "expansions". It spreads a calming atmosphere of pleasurable silence when I play it which is very special. There was a time I made one or two plays everytime before going to bed.

Dreamy.

I proxied this game with an incomplete deck of Uno cards, so was unable to play with any of the modules. For those who say I'm missing out on the theme by doing so, I am personally not a fan of the psychedelic art style, and how bare bones the game is makes me believe it is pretty abstract anyways (I also didn't feel the theme at all when watching reviews). Maybe the modules changes things, but a lot of the time I felt like the game kind of played itself, in that I could probably have programmed some algorithm to play the game for me. The only real tough decisions that I found were when using the key cards. I guess for a quick solitaire game that is small enough to play on an airplane tray table I shouldn't expect too much, but I don't understand why this is touted as one of the pacesetters in its genre.

EDIT: Figured out how to proxy The Books of Steps Lost & Found. The spells adds a little bit more decisions in the game, and has some nice discard management that increases the times you want to discard rather than just play randomly following getting 3 in a set. Still doesn't blow me away by any means though.

EDIT 2: Got the free app and plays much better that way, as the faster pace makes it a good turn my brain off for 6 minutes break, rather than a 15-minute fluff with too much shuffling (and this is coming from a guy who loves deckbuilders. While perhaps the number of times you shuffle is comparable or possibly even less in Onirim, since the deck starts out so big it takes much longer for someone like me who can only pile shuffle, and also since it is shorter than most deck builders the shuffles per minute is higher).

Thoroughly strange! I don't understand what is going on in this abstract dreamworld, and that makes me like this game less. We have played all of the included expansions, and doubt that we will ever buy any others. Will attempt this game here and there in the future. It's quick.

A nice little game with several possibilities of playing due to 3 expansions. It's a light, relaxing game but can be quite challenging if you play with different expansions and combinations of them.

When we include all three expansions the game becomes really challenging and offers some meaningful decisions each turn.

I don't warm to the way the game expects you to remember every single card you have discarded. Perhaps that's part of the fun for some. The reality for me was that it led to many occasions where I played on to the end completely unaware that I had already shot myself in the foot ten minutes ago and that I could have stopped then and started up a new game in the same time, had I known. Frustrating. That combined with the insane amount of shuffling means that this game collects dust.

I like the play, but the amount of custodial work in relation to play is a big turn-off. For starters, you'll re-shuffle before your first card is played three-quarters of the time. A quarter of remaining cards can trigger a shuffle -- sometimes more than once. Finally, sometimes you must fan through the deck to find and remove a specific card (?!), then shuffle.

There is some debate in the forums about whether the basic game is difficult enough. FWIW, I won 6 of 8 plays of the base game. I might try a variant.

The theme and distinct art are pluses, but there are a couple usability annoyances:
* The [geekurl=/image/1530384]red door is brown-ish and the brown door is red-ish[/geekurl].
* The backs have an orientation, and you can spot it from the side, so take care not to leave a hint when returning a card to the deck.

RATING: 7
A fascinating solo game (can be played 2 player) with a kind of deck-depleting mechanic. The basic process is to lay down a row of "chamber" cards until you get 3 in a row of the same colour, at which point you score a "door". 8 doors wins you the game. When replenishing your hand though, "nightmares" come up, which force you to discard. If the deck runs out you lose. Three expansions come in the box that add additional goals and restrictions, and special actions and effects. Comes together very nicely, and hard to believe it's a solo game!

Solitaire: What a weird and peculiarly wonderful little game. There isn't much to the basic game, but it tells a story in its own way, and the artwork is perfectly matched to it.

It took about half of my first game for it to click; I went on to win with a good chunk of the deck left. The second game was also an easy win, a red flag for me with any solitaire game. It lacks both tension and interesting decisions -- most decisions are obvious. Time for one of the (included) expansions!

The two-deck box and fold-out rules aren't as nice as, say, Friday, but it does keep the cost down. It's nicely portable, too.

The Book of Steps Lost and Found expansion: Ah, this is better. Collecting the doors in order, and having spells you can cast using the discard pile, adds enough levers and choices to make Onirim interesting without increasing the play time. My first play with the expansion was a win win just a handful of cards left in the deck, right down to the wire -- the way I like it.

I'll never play the basic game solitaire again, but with the expansion it's fun. A few plays in, I really like the artwork and the slightly creepy vibe the whole game gives off.

---

With the expansion I lost twice more and raised my rating from 7 to 8. This is a good game, short and quirky and peculiarly affecting, and it's fun to bust out for a few minutes.

I like the artwork but it turns out sologaming isn't that fun (well, obviously, to me boardgame is about 70% about social interaction and about 30% the game itself, but I thought it would be bit more fun) - I'll rather play Hearthstone online so I can still have a live opponent, if I can't find gaming partner. I'm keeping it in my collection because you never know, maybe I'll want to play a sologame one day and then I'll much rather play this than bigger game that only has variant for solo and will feel inferior to multiplayer. SOS Titanic is even better though.

Was a time when I liked to take a small solo game with me on business trips or play a solo game to 'chill' away from the rest of the family. This was my game of choice until I got Urbion.

I never got good enough to play with the expansions, but it was very definitely a hard 'solitaire' that took some strategizing to be successfully - but also a modicum of luck in when the Doors and Nightmares came out. But then sometimes I think I might accuse games of a fault that they don't have, simply because I haven't figured them out.

This game is fine.  I have the app version, which is probably for the best since it has a lot of shuffling.  There's not exactly a ton here but for an app game it ticks the right boxes.  I would never play this with the physical components.

RATING: 8
The game functions with a level of ease that surpasses traditional solitaire, but has a fixed timeline, which seems to give the player more responsibility for establishing and priorities and making predictions, placing the emphasis on the player's decisions and taking it off of deck composition.  It can be nice and light at time, or a serious brain burner with the expansions that do a great job of adding new challenges without throwing random debris into the machine of gameplay.  I have yet to play it with a partner, but with the base game being as good as it is, coop play is something that I am eager to try.  In a word, though, I have to say that Onirim is simply "surprising" in how it plays itself out, and has led to more than a few truly great gaming moments.  The game somehow never feels cheap or unwinnable, and that hope of walking the line to victory every time is what makes the game fantastic even in defeat.

I've only played this as a solitaire game.  The artwork and theme is engaging and the play is fairly simple, but does offer some good (and I would even say tense) decisive moments.  Quite a bit of shuffling, although the cards are high quality so this is more of a time concern than a wear-and-tear concern.  I'm not sure if it has tons of replayability, but as a quick little solo game it works well.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: An abstract solitaire card game (with optional two-player co-op rules) of hand management and a thinly layered theme of racing to find the doors needed to escape a bad dream.

Played as: Solo (vanilla, Spells exp., Tower exp.), 2 player (vanilla only)

Pros: The game is well balanced, quick to play, portable, and does a good job of building tension. Probably the best quick solo I've played that has a win/lose condition rather then playing for a score. The art work is suitably whimsical and enjoyable. Having the choice of three expansions in the box is nice although probably necessary. Feels like one of those often requested games you could play on an airplane ride.

Cons: Too much shuffling. This lengthens the game that could take a third the time. While the theme is cute and the art support it well, the game still feels like a standard abstract solitaire game when you get down to it. There's not enough to mix up the gameplay eather outside of the expansions which ends up feeling like a convoluted way of doing it. Simple changes that make a big impact are a better way to change things up rather then adding a bunch of rules just to create more of the same.

Other: I actually vastly enjoy the game more with a partner over the solo experience. It kind of has a kind of Lost Cities co-op cousin feel to it. Some of the expansions are hit and miss. The first one (with the spells) feels really natural like the game shouldn't be played the other way while the Tower feels unnecessarily fiddly for the sake of difficulty. 

Best Use: A quick simple co-op for you and the spouse or a quick solo experience.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]26-Jan-2013[/u]: This is a fantastic little card game that is perfect for 10 to 20 minutes of solitaire time.  Included are the base game and three "expansions" all in one small, very portable package.  The game can be played with two players in cooperation as well.  After the first play or two, the rules should come together for you.  The additional expansions add a few extra cards and additional rules/win conditions.  The expansions can be mixed and matched in any combination which adds to the variety of play and challenge.  You are playing your cards to the table, searching your dreams, and looking for eight Doors to escape.  There are Nightmare cards, though, that haunt you and cause you to discard cards from your hand or the table.

I find this an excellent solo experience.  It's fairly quick and easy to learn.  It can travel with you so it's great to bring on trips or play during a lunch hour.  I've found plenty of replayability with this one.  The artwork and card quality is very good.  There is a lot of shuffling in this game though.  Just keep that in mind.

RATING: 7.5
Nehéz megmagyarázni, mi fogott meg benne. Az első 4-5 játék során mondjuk semmi, kifejezetten nem szerettem. De szerencsére kapott még esélyt és néhány nap alatt több mint 30 partit tettem bele. Addiktív, pedig nincs benne semmi különleges mechanizmus, kifejezetten szóló játék (oké, ketten is lehet, de az állítólag nem olyan jó - kvázi, mint a fordított szex, ami ugye meg pont ketten jó, egyedül meg nem annyira).

Pasziánsz alapokon nyugszik, egyszerre öt lap lehet kézben és cél a négy különböző színű ajtó "levadászása" a pakliból, kétszer (merthogy minden színből két ajtó van). Ez történhet három megegyező színű kártya lerakásával, vagy kulcsos kártyákkal. A lerakásnál egyetlen szabály van: ugyanolyan mintázat nem követheti egymást. Ezeken kívül van még kb. 3-4 mondatos szabály és így ennyi az egész. De mégis működik. Ha agyonütnek sem tudom megmondani, miért. Kb. mint a hármas metró. Nem kéne már neki, de mégis gurul (néha elfüstöl persze, de attól még elvisz A-ból B-be). Az Onirim annyival több ennél, hogy azt legalább élvezed is. Na, ezt meg már végképp nem tudom, hogy miért. Kész rejtély ez a játék.

Android appja van meg egyébként.

RATING: 10
Excellent, evocative, rich, innovative, solitaire card game. The basic game by itself is challenging and fun; add in the three expansions and you've got all kinds of new challenges and variety. Unfortunately, the game becomes noticeably easier with multiple expansions, but perhaps the variants that make each expansion slightly more difficult would help. Still, it's an outstanding entertainment using the basic game alone or any [i]one[/i] of the expansions (I find the towers the easiest).

The cooperative two-player version of the game is well worth playing as well, although I have a lot less experience with it. Too bad [i]Onirim[/i] wasn't around years ago--it would have spared me the many hours I wasted playing [i]Klondike[/i] and other solitaire drivel. [129 plays, all but 12 of them solo]

Update: acquired the beautiful new edition, but have yet to try the latest expansions.

All plays so far are solo, base game only.

I like this more than I expected to. By design it seems to crescendo as the deck gets smaller and the likelihood of drawing a nightmare increases. That said, it seems paradoxically more solvable than other solo/co-ops (Ghost Stories, Pandemic, etc), and at the same time more dependent on luck.

Looking forward to trying this with Juliana.
-----------------------------------------

Have played it a few more times, and while the game is interesting and unique, it's also sort of forgettable. I mean, when it's time to play a game, I don't say, "OOh, let's play Onirim." I even tried it with kids at school and it fell flat for them as well. The metaenvironment around here seems to be a consensus that co-ops are dumb.

I had a very luckily minor car accident last year caused by another party and I ended up in the A&E for several hours. Whilst convincing the staff that I was ok to go I played Onirim in a side room. This and many other occasions I have gotten absorbed in this game. I wonder if it's because it reminds me of a dream that I had when I was in Primary School. Anyway, so far I have a link with this game (Vanilla almost exclusively), sometimes I won't play it for months. It just sits in a perfectly fitting transparent plastic box on the side ready to go. Much prefer the Z-Man cards without dark faded edges but I will play with the Pegasus until destruction.

I will just quote my email to the author:

Hi,

I just wanted to congratulate you for your game "Onirim".

I would be hardly pressed to find words that could adequat[e]ly express my deep admiration of your design.

In this moment I won the game (using all three expansions in their hardest variant). It was a very satisfactory experience and I am just a tiny bit sad that I will never be able to experience it the *first* time again.

I just hope that I will be able to create such a game myself one day.

A solo card game.  Travel through the dreamscape opening two sets of each of the four color doors.  

Every turn you play or discard a card, than draw a card, and finally re-shuffle the 'limbo' pile back into the deck.  A few things get in the way of doing all these things smoothly, namely nightmare cards, and trying for a prophecy.  

It's a fun card game, but I worry I am playing something wrong because of the ease. Also will try the expansions later.

Edit: Now that the app is out, this should be the game that "fires" any version of solitaire you play on mobile.

So you like Klondike and Spider but are tired of playing them?  Try Onirim.  It is quick to play and offers typical solitaire card game dilemmas - which card(s) to discard knowing they are gone for good.  There is a TON of shuffling, so I would recommend getting a 100 pack of the European sleeves.

Why this is not a 10:
-> It is solitaire by default - no reason to suggest it!
-> Like any card solitaire, it becomes repetitive quickly

Why this is 8+:
+ quick
+ nice artwork
+ offers interesting solitaire decisions

Easy-to-learn Solitaire-style card game offers a real challenge with more strategy and less luck required than some others. What really puts it over the top, though, are the beautiful, thematic artwork and the intuitive two-player option. Quick gameplay and small size make this a great game to play on the go.

Can be played with 2 but basically more a solo game. 
It's nice enough and somewhat relaxing, I also somehow like the artwork, although it's a little weird. 
Overall it's nice enough but just nothing really special that gets me excited and the reshuffeling can get a litte annoying sometimes.

Played twice with 6 year old. Got a rule wrong previously and still lost but the last game played was nailbitingly close. We won even though there were still 5 nightmares in the deck with only 9 cards remaining. The tension at game end bumped this from a 7 to 8 for me.

RATING: 7
I have only really played this solo and it provides a gentle diversion that is preferable to watching TV. It sets up super fast and has a small footprint which makes it a good solo game.

I have the old version which comes with 3 mini expansions in the box; I believe the new version has more. To be honest I don't bother with them. Onirim is essentially abstract and I feel that abstract games need to be as clean as possible to keep my attention. The more fiddly they become, the less worthwhile they appear. 

I have had the game for a while and used to like it a bit more, which is why the rating's a 7. These days there are a good few games which I would prefer to pull out.

RATING: 9
Alongside SOS Titanic, the best quick-playing solitaire game I know. Onirim is certainly not a mere luckfest; the game rewards skillful play. The idea that you're lost in a weird dreamscape is effectively conveyed by the imaginatively surreal artwork, and to enhance further this effect I recommend putting on something ambient and hypnotic, for instance Aphex Twin's 'Selected Ambient Works Volume II'.
The recently-released app is also worth investigating, and incidentally it features the music of another ambient producer, Loscil, although he seems to be uncredited.
Also worth noting is Onirim's excellent replayability, thanks not only to the compelling gameplay of the base game, but also on account of the many mini-expansions that significantly change the game. You can mix-and-match thes modules, leading to a fresh gameplay challenge with each new combination.

After exploring all the expansions, my rating has increased. The expansions really are just additional levels of difficulty provided within the game, done by adding in new card types to build, forcing you do things in a certain order or adding triggerable penalty cards. Each expansion has an easy level and a hard level and they're all mixable and matchable, so as you've got the gist of how to tackle one combination, you can move onto a different combo which may require a different approach to win. I think there are 27 different combinations and my appreciation for the game grew as I worked my up through the easier levels (base, standalone expansions at easy) into the harder levels of each expansion, plus certain combinations (ie tower / premonitions without spells). 

Essentially you play once through the deck with the aim of extracting the 8 door cards (2 in each colour) from the deck. There's 2 ways of doing it - having the key card in that colour in your hand when it appears, or build 3 in a row to the tableau in the same colour without 2 adjacent cards having the same symbol. The good news is that if you can't extract, it goes back into the deck. The hard bit is how to deal with the 10 nightmare cards (in the 76 card deck) - you can do so by discarding a key (powerful cards in short supply), or discarding your hand and drawing a new (usually the best bet if you don't have keys in hand), losing one of your hard gotten doors or discarding 5 cards off the top of the deck (which could be disastrous if keys are lost). So there are good decisions to make throughout. The game is marred by the oft-required shuffling, needed whenever doors appear when you can't extract them, or when you re-draw a hand (when you get to ignore nightmares and doors). 

The different expansion combinations can require different styles to increase your chances of getting the job done, and this provides some of the ongoing appeal, learning how to best approach this version. Differences could be discard vs play ratios, how often to play keys as prophecies, which of the 4 ways should I deal with the nightmare cards, and so on. At the harder levels, it may generally come down to sheer luck, but getting yourself into position for the win isn't, and that's the challenge.

Far more luck than skill. More of a time-passer than an interesting game. Frustratingly difficult at times. The cooperative rules allow only very limited interaction. I wish it had a stronger/more fun theme.

Comment: It's a quick little solo game that can also be played co-op. The theme is non existent, but the artwork is very interesting. It is quite luck driven, but you do have options to mitigate that. Using keys to discard potential nightmares from the top of the deck and organizing those remaining four cards can really fix the luck. Not sure how long I can play this game before I get burned out on it, but I'm trying to play at least 1 game a day of it. I'd also like to try out some of the expansions which should massively increase it's game play potential. The first expansion was ok, but it needs more plays to figure out if it stays in the box or not.

Finally got to play with 2 players. It works almost the same except you essentially have a hand of 8 cards instead of 5. I found it to be a bit easier, but you really have to be careful with what you discard from your hand.

Optimal Player Count: 1

Works fine with 2 players.

RATING: 4
Initially rated a 5 lowered it to a 4.

It's a good game to play solo if you are into this kind of gaming. I discovered with Onirim (and with AL Cabohne) that I'm not particularly fond of solo card games of this type as I tend to feel kind of empty after playing. In the end it has a puzzle feel that's not very rewarding.

It has some good mechanisms, an appealing (although thin) theme. It has also an interesting naive-darkish art but I think the color pallette is not the best for the sake of clarity, specially on the doors, as I kept mistaking the red and brown door cards, which lead to a little frustration.

Finally, for a game that requires a large amount of reshuffling, the quality of the cards is not good enough. The edges are not rounded to allow for good regular mixing and the cards are a little too thick to allow for a good riffle shuffling, so in the end the overall tactile aspect is not pleasant.

Not a game for me.

Once I get a card shuffler or the expansion comes out that reduces card shuffling, I will move this game up to an 8, or even higher. It really is quite a clever, fun design, with a lot of decisions to make. Three expansions are packed right into the box, and it's only ten dollars. This game is the best value to gameplay ratio I have other than maybe Times Square. Very impressive and fun, and I look forward to playing it more.
This game precludes ever playing 'Solitaire' ever again. It's nearly as portable as a deck of cards, and much better looking and more fun to boot. 

EDIT: Just like Friday, for a game that fulfills the same function, Space Hulk: Death Angel is just straight up better.

RATING: 7
An interesting and unique game. I played 6 times, and won only the last session. 

Games like these, very whimsical and odd, seldom cross my path these days. Seems like the markets are so glutted with "more of the same," and titles focused on commercial success rather than creative exploration. 

Don't get me wrong — there's nothing intrinsically evil about trying to make money; In fact, I'm all for it. It's just that artists seem to produce their best and most original work when not worried about paying rent, or following up their last big seller. 

((sigh))

Anyway, aside from constant and tedious shuffling, this game has got some good things going on: mixing hand management, with push your luck, and some weighty decisions. Unlike many "simple games," this title seems to reward thoughtful consideration of each decision, and doesn't rely solely on the randomness of the card draws to supply tension. The player is offered opportunities to manage the risk involved in each card draw, and that alone adds significant value and quality to this title. 

Also, I enjoyed the theme and the art, and the components are well made. 

Do yourself a favor and invest in some penny card sleeves, as the cards will doubtlessly take some significant wear and tear during play. Expect to shuffle the deck 5-8 times during each play.

A clever little solo card game. I'm not a fan of the art, or the fact that you're always shuffling the deck, but for a game that takes 10 minutes to play you could do worse.

Own the app version. A solitaire-ish game that contains some strategy and push-your-luck elements. Unlike solitaire though, this game contains some take-that elements from the nightmare cards, which makes the game more difficult for the player. Luck of the draw is paramount in this game, but optimal play could mitigate some of the luck. The game requires lots of shuffling so the app version is ideal and faster, especially for solo players.

The basic game is fairly straightforward and can be tedious after a few plays, but the real fun starts when you throw in some expansions. You get to make a lot important decisions and it feels like you have more impact on the final success (or defeat). I will never forget my first play with The Book of Steps Lost and Found - I won the game thanks to the last card in my deck! 

UPDATE: Unfortunately, it gets a bit stale after multiple plays. I think luck plays bigger role than I have originally assumed. Still, it's a decent title to chill out when you have a bit of free time and you're alone (or nobody wants to play with you, sigh).

UPDATE 2: I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Often I just can't stand it, but then, after a long break, I will play it again and again - like an addict.

My favourite solo game.
Drawing cards, deciding when to play which cards, pushing your luck, playing the odds, hoping to get a good shuffle. Even though this game has a decent amount of luck, it doesn't take away from the game itself. If anything, the randomness actually adds a level of tension where you know that each card you draw can be your downfall.
It's quick to play (15-30 minutes depending on how fast you play and what expansions you incorprorate) and very portable. In fact, the majority of my games I've played at either the airport or in a train.
The expansions too are great. You can play with any combination (with varying difficulty levels) and still have a great game each time

It's a cut above the classic Solitaire in art and mechanics but the deck is playing you. With only five cards hands, building to sets is just playing the table in front of you. Expansions (Provided in box) offer more choices and are a must for longevity but the basic mechanics are less clever play and more "draw draw FINALLY" or "draw draw DAGNABBIT."

Fairly fun. I haven't played with the expansions yet, so I'm hoping it gets more fun with those. Near the end of my first game I felt like I was gaming the system because I had the final 2 keys in my hand so every time a nightmare came up I just discarded 5 from the deck (since doors can't be discarded I was assured victory).

Played with the first expansion and won on the 2nd attempt. Was a bit more challenging, about the same fun factor.

Kartenspiel für eine Person, bei dem Karten unterschiedlicher Farben passend zu bestimmten Symbolen nacheinander abgelegt werden müssen.
Das Spiel macht mir nach den ersten Durchgängen viel Spaß und bietet durch Varianten genügend Abwechslung für etliche Wiederholungen.
Meines Erachtens eignet sich das Spiel insbesondere als App (ist sogar gratis und nur die Varianten kosten insgesamt ca. 2 Euro extra, was wirklich fair ist), weil die Karten sehr häufig gemischt werden müssen und die App das dem Spiel abnimmt.

2011-12-22: Thanks Secret Santa! :)

Unusual theme/art in this nice solo game. Fun, but has drawback of needing to shuffle many times, theoretically you might need to shuffle after every turn, and in practice it feels like you do shuffle after about half the turns, more or less.

My version has 3 expansions:

1: Steps
You must collect the doors in a specific order randomly determined at setup, so that's harder.

You can permanently spend discarded spells to activate several different spells (e.g. spend 10 discarded cards to deal with a revealed nightmare with no further penalty), so that's easier.

The 2 changes don't seem particularly thematically linked, but it's a fine little expansion. I've not played enough yet to know if it makes it harder or easier to win...

2: Towers
A new type of labyrinth card in your deck: 12 towers. They are a second required victory condition in addition to the 8 doors: you also need to have 4 towers in play. If you're not careful, you may find yourself with too many discarded towers as the game's end approaches! Especially since you can discard a tower to look at and re-order the top cards of the deck.

Seems a fine little expansion. Mildly inconvenient that the cards are mixed into the main deck, making it harder to play later without the expansion if you are so inclined. Also I found the red towers look confusingly similar to the red doors if I'm not paying close attention...

Very good game, quick and including some braining and decision making (discard a key or 5 random cards? or maybe discard those 3 cards you have in hand and hope to get similar one to finish a set? etc.).

The game time and setup are extremely fast - this is plus!

I have to say that the rules advise some shuffling when, in my opinion it is not necessary, hence I slightly modified those rules :P

So, to start off with, I'm not much of a fan of pure cooperative games and this theme does nothing for me. It's not that I need to explore it more to understand the nuances I'm not seeing - I really just don't want to. This one is a simple calculate the odds game with great scope to mix it up and play in different ways, which is a good thing. In my case I'd prefer to spend my gaming time elsewhere, but if you like the art and want a friendly game you can play solo or with two, then this might just be the ticket.

I've played it two times in a row, won the second one. Easily. Uhm, it's a patience solitaire. 

Narrative absent. Different art doesn't make it immersive on its own. I play games primarily for the company of people and even if I've had an occasional satisfying sessions with certain non solitary games, they were longer and had pronounced narrative. Solitary filler simply isn't what I'm after. I think I am capable of wasting 10 minutes on my own without a boardgame. Maybe I'd try it again with an expansion or two, but don't really see the point of it. 

Am not target audience, feel free to ignore this comment. Art is cute, not saying it's not.

"Onirim" is an inexpensive card game from Z-Man Games that can be played with 1 or 2 players. It has FANTASTIC artwork and comes with 3 expansions IN THE BOX already! I've only played the base game so far, but I really like it. It's simple to understand and play, but difficult to win, as usual. That means that I just keep playing more and more trying to get better and conquer the game. That probably won't happen, but the base game has kept me busy enough that I haven't even tried any of the expansions r variants yet! In addition to the great artwork and replay value, this game is extremely portable.

If I had to say one thing to describe Onirim, it would be shuffling. Wow. There is seriously too much card shuffling in this game. Play a card, draw a card. Did you finish a set of cards? Get that door and then shuffle. Now draw back up. Did you draw a door? Shuffle again. Ugh. Still, it's a pretty enjoyable experience and one that plays quickly. It can be frustrating with the random draws leading to multiple Nightmare cards that basically nuke your hand or cause you to give up a door or a key card. It's small enough to keep a spot on my shelf and I'll pull it out for a few plays every now and then. Also, the expansion content is pretty terrible for the most part. Stick with the base game.

At first, we were playing it with a horrible strategy and were completely unable to win, but once we figured out that sun-moon-sun or moon-sun-moon could get you a door, we were off and running.  It is random, but with some skillful play you can generally give yourself a fighting chance, and I like the press-your-luck element that occurs when facing the nightmares.  I'm glad it comes with expansions because I think that after a few plays of the base game, you're up for a new challenge.

After just few plays, I'm really starting to enjoy this game. Even though it's sometimes luck if you draw just what you need, it offers some important decisions that effect how the game will play out. Really like it. Since most of the week I'm forced to play solo (no friends around, they live far away, so I see them only once a week), I picked this game to be mostly for solo plays. And it surprised me how great it plays.

When I have enough of online plays on my computer (playing World of Tanks mostly and that game can just make you mad sometimes) and my 3DS has to charge up, this or Race for the Galaxy are definetely games I will go to.

It's also a very quick game and I just love the theme. Dream world? Awesome! Just wished the cards had different pictures on them, so I could just flow through the dream world during play. But I like it nevertheless.

Bought this version because it was on sale and I didn't know if I would like it. The second edition costs here like 4x more. Now I wonder if I shouldn't have payed more for that second edition. Oh, well...

Edit: After more plays and using one of the expansions, raising the rating to 9.5. It plays very quickly, makes you think, the luck aspect is actually not a bad thing, it keeps the game fresh since you play only solo without any other oponent than the game itself and still lets you make strategic choices. A lovely game I just always pick up when I get home from work for at least 1 or 2 plays.

I pretty much never play board games solo.  Along with being a fan of board games I also have other interests like reading, video games, film, etc.  So if I'm not playing board games with others, which is the best way to play them, I'm not really interested.  It's the same reason I don't play many video game adaptations of board games.  Part of the whole experience is the tactile and same room ineraction with others and the board game itself.

All that being said this game wasn't really going to be my thing.  It is a single player game of playing cards from your hand in a specific pattern (no two same symbols in a row) until you unlock 8 doors.  There are nightmare cards that you draw from the deck as well and they force you to choose one of four methods to mitigate them.  Use a key card, discard your hand, discard the top 5 cards of your library, or return an unlocked door to your deck.  Not only is this a solo game but it is incredibly uninteresting as well.  You have very few choices and none of them are really that interesting.

For solitaire play without extensions, it is simple puzzler — interesting, but not to the point of falling in love with. Solo puzzles are not quite my favorites. As for 2-player mode, the game is a bit more interesting, but again, not our kind. With expansions game shines a bit more.

In overall, design is neat and has a few neat twists. Also, graphic design is very good, although I messed two colors once or twice — warm pastel colors are a bit hard to distinguish. Despite this, as I’m afraid it will gather dust on my shelf I decided to sold it.

A simple game that provides an enjoyable challenge. The artwork on the cards is quite unique and also very appealing. The basic premise of the game is to attempt to obtain exit doors to various rooms within a dream-based labyrinth. This is accomplished by attempting to complete a run of three matching room cards from your hand of five, or by finding a door card whilst possessing a matching key card. The main decisions you face throughout the game revolve around the dilemma of what to do when drawing a nightmare card - do you discard your entire hand, a single precious key card, an already hard earned exit door, or the top five (unseen) cards from the deck, which might contain several of the much needed key cards. There's obviously a large amount of luck involved in drawing cards but you do feel as though you have quite a lot of control of your destiny in this game. It works well as a solo game and it's also very quick to play.

[APR 2017] Played it, enjoyed it, time to move on.

An excellent game to play solo or co-op.  The art, the gameplay and the sheer cleverness of it make it a winner. The expansions bump up the difficulty level and make it a more tense experience.  The basic game can be easy with a good draw of cards, but it can go badly with lazy game play.

10/05/2011 - Today I finally beat the game with all expansions in.  [b]Huzzah![/b]

Played with incorrect rules -- didn't care for the game.  Played with correct rules, no expansions -- thought it was so-so.  Played with all expansions at once -- took it off the trade list.  Full game is a keeper.  Plenty of thought and strategy for a 25-30 min solo game.

Been playing the base set a lot as a solitaire game (wonderful!) but the directions are kind of poorly written (highly recommend getting the smaller paste up download; helped me a lot).  Haven’t played yet with 2-player mode or expansions, but maybe when I get tired of the base game I will.

An unusual card-based dream game.

I've played 1 solo game and quite enjoyed it and one 2 player game which fell pretty flat.

Though the theme is fairly easy to ignore, I quite liked it. The constant shuffling of the draw deck is frustrating though.

I played for the first time this weekend. I like this one. It's an interesting game in the "heavy filler" category. 

We played in 2-player co-op mode. But people say it's also a good solitaire game. I don't usually like solitaire myself but I can see what they mean. 

There are 3 expansions included in the box - I'm looking forward to trying those out next time.

Solitaire game focused on set collection and risk/reward. The theme of escaping a dream world by finding the hidden doorways is extremely cool, and the game works well. The expansions look to make it even more interesting. I wish it had a bit more theme present in the mechanics of play.

Solo game that got a lot of play at the start of 2014, when I was trying to play and log a game every day.  Enticing enough to be acceptable for the task, but not engaging enough on a long-term basis to want to return to.  The challenge level is high, and it plays fairly quickly, both of which are pluses in my book.  It felt very samey for me though, even as I improved (I think) in my strategies.  To be fair, I haven't tried out the three mini-expansions, which may add the variety I feel the base game lacks.  While solo-games may scratch one gaming itch, this one doesn't intrigue me enough to warrant further play.

Onirim is a solo card game where the object is to complete all your "Door" cards before the deck runs out.

You must either play or discard a card from your hand each turn. Cards come in four colors (red, blue, tan, green) and four (or five if you have the expansion) symbols (sun, moon, key, and glyph with the expansion). There are also 2 door cards of each color (three of each with the expansion) and 10 nightmare cards.

To play a card you add a card to the line in the center of the table... but it cannot be the same symbol as the previous card's symbol. If you play three cards in a row, you pull a door card of that color out of the deck; it is completed now. After playing (or discarding) a card, you draw a replacement card from the draw deck.

Discarding cards removes them from play and does nothing else for sun and moon cards. If you discard a key card, you draw five cards from the draw deck, then discard one of them, reorder the rest and return them to the top of the draw deck. If you can discard a nightmare card this way do it. You are forbidden from discarding door cards this way.

If you draw a door card while you have a key card in hand, you can discard the key card to complete that door card. In the expansion, if you discard a glyph card, you draw five cards and if one of them is a door card you can complete it.

If you ever draw a nightmare card, you must either a) discard your hand of cards, b) discard a single key card from your hand, c) discard the top five cards of the draw deck, or d) return a completed door card to the draw deck.

Almost anytime you do anything you reshuffle the draw deck. Twice. At least that's what it feels like.

If you manage to complete all the door cards before the deck runs out, you win.

The game was interesting and enjoyable enough as a time-waster when I was playing it as an app. I haven't played the physical version, but I suspect the constant shuffling would kill the fun for me.

RATING: 7.5
Ah, this game appears to be really good. Rating after 5 plays. I still need to figure out if there is really some tactical gameplay, or just luck in the draw. I'm kind seeing it (the importance of the decisions), but can't really say for sure right now. So, a 7 at this point.

Still need to try the expansions.

****

Edit: Tried two of the expansions: The Towers and the Book of Lost and Found. The Towers is nice, giving something else to pursue, but also making the game easier, which I didn't liked. The Book of Lost and Found, onde the other hand, makes the game more challenging and gives to it a new layer of tatics regarding the discard pile, and this is very good. So, now I basically always play with the BoLaF - hey, this is a neat acronym.

I've only played the basic game, with 1p rules. The 2p coop doesn't look interesting but I plan to try the included expansions.

I played twice, once with a couple of rules wrong and then a second time with correct rules, and the second time I won handily. But I don't feel like I did anything particularly clever, and also feel like I had amazing luck drawing cards.

You spend more time shuffling than thinking/playing. The issue is that there are times where you only want to draw certain types of cards from the deck, and anything else needs to be set aside and then shuffled back in.

In a nutshell you are trying to play certain sequences of cards. You have to keep your hand full: When you draw you may get a nightmare card which requires you to choose one of four bad effects. One I would never choose, one I would probably always choose if possible, and between the other two I feel the decision is not that tricky. You lose if the draw deck runs out before you complete your goals.

Ooh, graphics look awesome. The concept sounds nice too!

edit: bought at Essen 2010. Very clever concept and looks good. There are some issues, however, the game play is not smooth enough for me - there is just a bit too much shuffling and other stuff that has to be maintained. Also how well you do in the game depends very heavily on luck. You have to discard few keys in one color and you lose the game. I think with a bit more development this could have been excellent, now it is OK. Graphics and the feeling is great anyhow!

edit2: I realized that we played the key thing wrong - you don't necessarily need the key symbols to get the doors... I think this might help a lot! :)

Lots of bells and whistles to this once the expansions are added in, very sensible to stagger the learning curve by separating them. 
Solo game is a very enjoyable activity – you truly do dread the nightmare card! Saying that it's more of a 'solving a puzzle' feel than an 'adventuring' feel. Perhaps once you really get the actions off pat you can more effectively talk yourself into the theme? Anyway, whatever, it's great to see good, new solo card games.

Very nice little solitaire card game. It comes with three included expansions that allow you make the game just as easy or as hard as you like it. With all the expansions, it becomes a full fledged, extremely difficult game with lots of tough decisions to make. When the base game is played by itself, it becomes a light filler I can play any time - even while waiting for my turn in a game with lots of downtime. 

I also really enjoy the "escape from the dream" theme and the art, which is sort of Paul Klee - esque and effectively evokes a dreamscape.

I did enjoy my play of this well enough for what it is.  The biggest issue I see is that replayability really feels lacking.  After a few games you'll know the card distribution well enough that it is largely a matter of pure probability to choose your best option.

Many board games won't be played often enough long-term replayability is actually a major issue, but I feel it's really important for a 15-minute co-op.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

A light set collection game with attractive graphics. Based on a single play, I really enjoyed it and want to play again. It's simple, but great for what it is and affordable too!


It evokes the theme of escaping from a dream labyrinth. You need to lay three cards of the same colour in a row without placing two cards with the same symbol adjacent. It's harder than it sounds!

Three variants with their own cards (described as 'expansions') are packed into the little box.

RATING: 5
Huh.  Based off of reading the rules alone, this sounds like it would be a pretty weak game.  It turns out that the game is actually a bit sharper and tighter than I expected.  The game is about risk management, hand management, and luck of the draw, and for a 10-minute solitaire game, that's just about right.  That there's actually a bit of tactics to use in the game make it a bit more interesting than other solitaire games that are strictly luck-fests, and all but one of the games I've played so far have both come down to the last three or five cards in the deck.  Not bad, not bad.

Has promise.  Need to try the different expansions before rating.

Update:

Have played both solo and 2-player, some vanilla and some with the expansions.  I've discovered that I have no interest in 10-15 minute solo games - or solo games at all, really, except to teach myself complicated games - but I'm happy to play this again 2-player.

Good value for the money, especially since four separate expansions are included.  

The downside:  Onirim has one of the worst rulebooks that I've read in quite a while.  While learning to play, I had questions on the basic ruleset and on every single expansion.  So be prepared to read the forums and find a few surprises, both good and bad.

Nice solo game. Not very deep or involving, but a good experience. Played three times without expansions and twice with the 'book' expansion, which made the game much more interesting.

Great solo card game - includes three expansions you can mix in, depending on the mood you're in and how long you want to play it for.

Played this as solitaire only and it's a quick pick and play game where the game just flows nicely.  The theme is also great where you are traversing through dreams and finding doors to exit your dreams.  I find myself really enjoying the adventure of such a simple game when I got 15 minutes to spare.

Only have the iOS version as the print one is hard to find. Lovely looking game, but very hard to win - I’m good at drawing nightmare after nightmare!

A roguelike in card form. Every step means danger. If you love videogames like Shiren the Wanderer, this game can give you the same feelings: not bad for a simple solitair, and it works well even as a co-op game with the right partner.

I got this on a whim, because it was a daily deal on amazon. I was surprised at its simplicity, and it kept me with how balanced the game felt. I ALWAYS had a choice. And one choice could mean the difference between winning and losing.

I wanted to give a solo game a try and this is always around the top of most lists. I enjoyed it and it's quite clever but I also discovered that solo games aren't for me.

This one didn't really work out for us. It's an okay game but nothing more. The expansions add to the base game but it all seems a bit thrown together. Also it really lacks an "endgame" - you play on and on and suddelny you win or you lose. A plus is that it works very well as a co-op game.

I like games that I can solo, and something that comes in a smaller package than Robinson Crusoe will surely be appreciated

An excellent card game with strange yet striking artwork that works very well with 1 or 2 players (and that's as many as it works with, in fact). Quick to play, easy to grasp, but with a solid balance between tactics, push-your-luck and risk-management factors.

Solid solitaire with three expansions included in the box. Would only rarely play while at home, but if it was all I had on a plane trip I would be mighty pleased.

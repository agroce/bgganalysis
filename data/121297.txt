Wow! Lots of game in a small box, and the Canadian fishing theme is really nice too. I like the multi function cards! Played several games with two people.

UPDATE: Tried it with four and the game seemed almost unplayable. So bad, in fact, that I think we must have done something wrong (especially considering that people on BGG all seem to think it's best with four). For this reason I'll wait with adjusting the rating. Have to do some research and try it again with four, since I love the theme and all of the two player games have been enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Somewhat dry Euro-style card game, in the same family as San Juan and its ilk. Great artwork, small box, and short playing time all make this an attractive prospect. There are multiple paths to victory and hence there is a lot of forward planning involved, along with a nice auction phase. A clever game.

RATING: 7
9 plays / 2,3,4,5,6 players
LIKE: Interesting, but thin, theme. Engine building, multi-use cards.
DISLIKE: The rules for the fishing licenses can be fiddly and hard to understand by first time players.

OVERALL: The game is all about the auctions combined with card powers. The expansion adds nice variety. We used expansion for 5th and 6th player, and randomize the licenses used. 6th player needs some rules clarification, suggest use 12 standard licenses on the top of the lic stack, and 10 standard licenses for 5 players.

RATING: 5
This really seems like a game I'd enjoy: multiple uses for cards, short playing time, light engine-building...but I had a really bad experience on my first play.  I went for a money/shrimp route on my first two turns...and was never able to get more than one card a turn.  I see now that cards are more valuable than money, and you must be able to have that as an essential component of your engine.  I had effectively invested early in a secondary currency.  I stayed WAY behind the whole game.  Not a fun experience.

Again, it had all the right ingredients for something I would like, but it just didn't fit together quite right for me.

RATING: 6.5
Let's get some things away.
The rules are not exactly very helpful. Neither are the symbols and their printed size/fonts.

Overall, the game has a feel of Princes of Florence.  Some auction, some building of boats and hiring of captains are similar. The main difference is a continuous addition of victory points in terms of fish crates.

The turns are quick but the limitation on what boats to launch is probably the part that is frustrating. 

Not for the beginners

Fleet is a pleasant, fairly elegant game of building up power combos with licenses to launch ships and collect fish veeps. There's an auction mechanic that isn't very auctiony, but adds a little tension if you want to fight for a license or prestige building every now now and then (fights are costly and thus rare). There's interesting abilities on the licenses and some decision making about when/how to launch and captain vessels to collect fish veeps (and potentially process those veeps back into $$ or cards).

I like it. It's depth isn't particularly heavy, but there are a good number of interesting options for a fast playing, nicely thematic card Euro.

Well, Fleet's theme was appealingly different.  Underneath that, however, it's a rather simple efficiency game in which you build a card-drawing engine in the early game, before switching to vps towards the end.  

The multi-purpose cards are reminiscent of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy; they can be ships or money or flipped over they are captains. However, comparisons with those games do Fleet no favours as strategically it seems to lack their depth. The main tension is between buying licenses and building ships, but ideally you want to do as much as possible of both.

The artwork is quite pleasing and production quality is very good.  As others have commented, the rules make a fairly hard job of explaining a straightforward game.

RATING: 7
Nice card game. The rules are simple enough and the setup takes no time. Players are bidding for some fishing licences. Each licence has unique abilities and allows you to 'build' the corresponding fishing boats. Like in most 'serious' cardgames each card can be used in 3 ways: either for money or for building or as captain. I also like the artwork. Fleet is a medium-weight cardgame but it doesn't provide that many options to the players. For deeper strategy you should try Race for The Galaxy or Glory to Rome.

RATING: 7
Really enjoy this game, but the first several turns have a tendency to feel like slogging through mud. Also the setup for this game (with any expansion cards) is miserable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After 1 play: I didn't find the theme and artwork grabbed me, and I didn't think the theme really worked (why am I rewarded with VPs for keeping fish on my ship rather than for selling them?) With only three licences up for auction each turn (and they don't usually disappear if no-one bids for one) there isn't a huge amount of choice about what you do in this game. I just played tactically & didn't see much opportunity for strategy. That could be a fluke of how the licence desk was shuffled, so I'd play again but for now I give it 6/10.

Neat little card game. Can't say you really feel the theme of the game or that there's much in the way of depth, but the game is easy to learn and play and interesting enough. Expansions help give some more options when playing. 2 player version includes a dummy player that only takes part in the bidding and works well enough to simulate bidding competition. Setup can be a real pain in the butt as you need to sort out each type of card from a mixed deck, pull out what you need, then shuffle them back together.

Still trying to get a handle on this auction/tableu builder.  I find it hard to evaluate the liscences (which is the central part of the game).  So my first few plays are mostly just blind stabs to see what happens.

Cute filler, plays rather fast with simple ruleset. Reminds vaguely of Power Grid without the map element and the amount of calculation need by that game, where handling you hand between auctions and launching ships and captains is its core. I still am not sure how interesting certain ships and to invest, need a few more games to find that out, but still..very exciting game, makes you want to get the expansions just to see what they introduce.

More plays will reveal if there are balance issues with winning the auction phase.

Love the components, like the elegance of the game but do not like the amount of space this game takes up for a card game or the challenge of remembering all the different times you can draw a card based on the licenses you have.

Also I do not like how if you end up a little resource short early in the game you will never come close to catching up.  I like it when your first few moves are setting up an advantage, rather than the most critical decisions you take.

I'd discounted this after reading the rules prior to Essen 2012 owing to what seemed to be excessive randomness which is inevitable in most card games. I was then given a copy which took a long while to hit the table, but it did get played tonight. 

Unfortunately it corresponds to my first impression after the rule read through. Its about building an efficient engine that offers benifits and bonuses as the game continues. However the card draw determines the cash you have to spend and the boats you can launch. Its possible to wait for several rounds for the right card when you have opted for a special license, only for it not to appear. Likewise you can average that an opponant has little auction leverage with 3 cards, only to find each is worth 3 coins each.

At game end I just felt I was drifting with the tide rather than steering the action. Not an experience I want to repeat and the game is up for trade/ sale with all the fish and expansion / kickstarter cards if you want it.

My friends and I tried to play this game but were never able to figure out how to get it moving properly.  We contacted the designer, but his vague description on how the game worked left us more perplexed than enlightened.  Since we could never get anywhere near where someone could win the game, we finally gave up and wrote the whole thing off as a non-starter.
I contributed to the fund raiser for the Arctic Bounty expansion, which means I have a even more stuff I need to put up on eBay to sell, completely untouched.

Gift of Guy M, with all promos. VERY much looking forward to trying it, it looks like a great game.

After 5 plays, I'm really impressed. I normally hate auction games, but in this one I find I can better sense the value of a card for my tableaux. Maybe it's because I'm used to weighting card values according to interactions with other cards due to playing too many CCGs and deckbuilders, but although I still overbid almost all the time, I love it.

It's a tight, well-paced, short game with quite a bit of strategic depth and a lot of combos that work in exciting ways. Shrimp/Codx2 is my favourite at the moment, although I'll usually pay for an early game tuna too. Having all the sub-in premium licenses is great too. At the moment the table favourite is the Casino.

I'm never disappointed when I play this game.  In our group, it is a favorite.

I really liked this, I wish we had time to play this again. Will definatly be getting more plays in the future.

Update - 2/15/2013

Had a chance to get this to the table again with my Friday group. Overall everyone seemed to enjoy it, it's quick to play and quick to teach but there is still plenty of substance to the game. My only real complaint about the game is that it seems pretty short. By the time you've got a really effeciant engine going the game is already mostly over.

Update - 1/13/2013

Not a fan of this game with two players. It makes the game quick and reduces the importance of the auction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great card game with an original theme and a very clever design. The license powers are well-balanced and sometimes deceptive: short term benefits like those given by the processing plant can really hurt you in the long term by restricting the number of points you get at the end (because you spent the whole game using your fish to get cash/cards). Some stupid-seeming cards (like the tuna license) are actually very powerful long-term strategies because they are free actions. 

I love the trajectory of going from totally cash-strapped and constrained at the beginning of the game to becoming a combo-wielding, action-laden powerhouse with more money and boats than you know what to do with by the end. The fact that this transformation occurs over a half-hour game is even better. Can't wait for the expansion.

Game play is very interesting in that your cards can be both workers(fishing boats) and money and the need to balance the two is critical.  What is not so good is that the setup for the game can be long if you have the expansions since you only play with a subset of available cards each game.

In Fleet, you're buying contracts in order to have permission to then send boats out to do some fishing for you.  Everything score points: the contracts, the boats, and the fish.

The neat twist is that there are contracts for all different kinds of "fishing": cod, lobster, shrimp, salmon, etc.  Each contract will give you different abilities, which increase in quality the more contracts you have in the type.  So, one type of contract may allow you to draw a card each time you launch a ship.  Another may allow you to bid on contracts for cheaper.  The trick is getting a combo of contracts that syncs up well, and allows you to get good bonuses.

The other cool thing about this is that there are expansions that allow you to play with a different mix of contracts each game, giving good game to game variety.

Cards are your main resource, as the cards are multi use, and are played for money to pay for stuff, are played as boats, and are played as captains (which allow the boats to fish).  You'll nearly always find you're short on cards, so managing them correctly is key.

Overall, some neat stuff that I would be happy to play once in a while, but for some reason didn't find all that exciting, even though there are some neat things going on.

I thought this a great card game based on one play so far. It uses the same discard cards to build things mechanic od San Juan and Race For the Galaxy but didn't suffer with the busy iconography of RFTG and was about as complex as San Juan.

Just kind of a boring game. The auctions aren't tight or interesting at all. It is disadvantageous to bid people up too high. Players tend to specialize in licenses to improve their bonuses, so there isn't any reason to fight someone else for the same license. Plus, there are only four processing licenses in the deck, so timing as to when these come out can arbitrarily screw you. 

I thought it was too long for how much game there is. I think a 30 minute playtime is optimistic when there are > a dozen auctions to work through. 

The actual actions the game presents you with are obvious - launch and captain as often as possible. And you spend a good chunk of the game just drawing and discarding cards. Way better games in this space. Meh.

A decent auction game. A bit tough to rate after one play. You've got a range of different boats with each type allowing you to "tech up" a benefit, and cards act as money, or ships, or the captains to run those ships.

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar:; I was so excited for this game. The components are beautiful and I love the classic look with all the crab and fish meeples (sold separately). But the runaway leader problem can't be ignored. I can handle unforgiving games in certain situations (i.e. meaty games where everyone is passionate about it and takes the game very seriously like COIN or 18XX); however, this game is too light and not captivating enough in theme to demand this level of skill. If you screw up in the first few bids, you're toast. No thanks.

A clone of San Juan/Race to the Galaxy. The added auction mechanism is not convincing. The theme is not consistent (i have to leave fish on the boat? what are 'processing vessels'?).

I like the theme, the exchange rate decisions, the extras and bonus cards, the while package. It runs fast and has a simple yet interesting gameplay. Nice solo too, although a bit too easy to manipulate. The setup, if you change the card set often, can be a bit of a chore.

After five games, I am loving it. It is quick - usually clocking in at 25-30 minutes for a 2p game. It offers real decisions, but in a limited sphere so that AP really won't (can't?) be an issue. My only difficulty is that it is over so quickly. I always want to play a second round, and occasionally, the kids allow us to do that.

Much more fun and tense due to a function asymmetry in player positions. Fleet just flops about like a fish stranded on the deck of a ship: helpless, stressed out, waiting for the end, or to be put back in the sea... meaning that the game is put back in the box and sold off to some hapless victim who doesn't yet know any better.

I really like how this game escalates the more contracts you fulfill.  Also, if you specialize in one specific fish it gets better and better, though it might be just as good for you to spread out your fishing.  It is a great game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

Only concern is that some games it appears to have a run-away leader.  Though some could say this is due to poor playing on the other players' end.

My brother introduced me to this game at the lake house last week.  Worker placement.  I really like building games with powers that cascade on top of each other.  You can really build a machine if you play it right.

A horrible rulebook, but ultimately easy to teach.

This light game is perfect, uncomplicated and can play quickly if everyone takes their turns at the same time after the auction phase. One of my first Kickstarters, and I was not disappointed.

The theme works well with this game too. Not enough where I'm actually pretending to run a fishing empire - but I do not think that any other would work as well.

A friend said he liked playing this game cause it makes him hungry for seafood and boy was he right. I couldn't stop thinking of lobster, king crab, shrimp, sushi...yumm.  I kept imagining me playing this game on the marina while chowing down on some fresh caught seafood. Okay yah, back to the game. It's a simple card game, buy licenses, ship boats, get captains, get vp in the form of a fish or listed on the cards. Pretty easy, but does make you want to reminisce the last time you ate seafood. Well, at least, it did for me.

Still a classic after all these years.  A simple system that goes in any number of different directions based on the licenses up for auction, the cards drawn and, of course, the actions of the players.

I don't really go for auction games where the commodity is simply a commodity - that is, a good that exists only to have a value.  Here, you are bidding for player powers, and you get to craft a unique tableau of powers throughout the game.  And all of them are REALLY good!  

It's interesting to see different lines of play open up depending on the order you get your licenses (and, for example, whether or not you get a processing license).

I have the expansion as well, but would honestly be content playing base Fleet (with "Gone Fishin'" cards added in!) forever.  This game is a classic.

This is a pretty neat game.  It plays quickly, but it is still a little meaty.  I like auctions, and this has them.  I also felt like I had to make meaningful decisions.

This is a fun little tableau building game. The auctions might be a bit more interesting in more than two player games so we may not be getting the full experience.

I have played mostly 2p games, and like this one a lot.

Bleh, yet another underdeveloped Kickstarter game. Getting the Processing License early, especially if you can get a Shrimp License shortly afterwards, gives players a ridiculous advantage over those that don't. This in turn leads to a nasty runaway leader problem. Plus, boring theme and the game is just too simple for my tastes.

[Edit: Removed my rating for now, as it appears that the guy who taught the rules made some mistakes, so I'm holding off final judgement for now, but other comments indicate that there's a serious runaway leader problem regardless.]

After several plays, it is a decent game.  It is obviously well designed and tested.  The cards are good quality, the art is good (though it is easily ignored).  

In the end though, it is ok.  I didn't think of Race for the Galaxy, as other reviewers did, but it is much more simple than RftG, and the theme doesn't make the game stand out in any way.

Decent.  That's about it.  I'll never suggest it, but I'll play it if it hits the table.

Great theme and nice artwork. 

Only played once but the game itself did not grab me - some of the mechanics did not fit thematically, e.g. the licenses were more important than the boats for giving some benefits. 

Money was so tight that the bidding felt underdeveloped and somewhat redundant - it's possible that on first playing our choices were so sub-optimal that this was our fault.

Also, quite a bit of luck in what cards were drawn and played a bit long to smooth that out by multiple plays.

Would play again if asked but would not suggest it.

Fleet, after a couple of plays, reveals itself as a fast and clean game wherein the auction phase is THE only really important phase. Most every other phase is fairly mechanical and non-interactive but they occur so quickly that it's no big deal.

Ok game. One problem seems to be that there's no catch up mechanism at all, if you fall behind it's game over for you. The game is not overly long so might not be a real problem.

The Pubs licences are deadly boring though and just kills game pace. I'd like to have some viable options to use instead. Don't like the randomness the alternatives add. Next time I'll remove some of them at least and play with all King Crab cards.

Update: After another play Pubs aren't so bad after all. :)

This game is one of those economic engine games where the cards serve multi-functions...they are the buildings, the money, the captains.  You also use the cards to purchase leases that allow you to draw bonus cards.  Everything is also worth VPs and the most wins.  A good game...not sure this is really filler.  But it is not that complicated once the light bulb comes on.  Ultimately though, I think this one will fade fast.  Nothing wow'ed me plus I'm not sure there are that many strategies.

Players are fishing entrepreneurs building up a fishing fleet in Canada.  Compact, neat little card game where players basically participate in a Powergrid style auction to obtain fishing licences, then San Juan style game play to play cards in one of three ways.  The licences permit the different types of fishing boats to be launched, and also grant different powers (purchase discounts, card draws, etc).  Cards may be played as a fishing boat, a captain, or cash.  The object of the game is to build a fishing fleet of boats, captain the boats, and use them to fish the waters, while augmenting your strategy with judicial licence purchases.  Points are awarded for fishing, boats and licences.  Nothing startling original, quite procedural, yet plays quickly, feels deep, and looks great.  Good engine into victory points game.  Caveat - takes a surprising amount of table space for a small box game.

A quick playing engine building game with hand management and bidding wrapped around it. The game is at first a relatively solo experience, but once you see the game a few times and have a better idea of license values the game takes off. 

Add in the expansion and the game becomes adjustable as modules can be added and removed at will. Each module adds the ability to go a completely different way strategically and Fleet becomes a game that can stand on its own with the competition.

Gets bumped to an 8. I do keep playing this game. It doesn't do anything special, and I'm not even sure there is that much real depth to the card play, but it scratches the points machine euro and light auction itch so well. It is a really great light to middle weight euro.

Fun filler auction game with a theme that has not been drowned yet. Like most auction games the true value of items can take a few plays to determine and the room for error is low. The game is genuinely short, 30mins, and gives you plenty to think about despite a simple rule set.

A nice engine-building game, playable in about 30 minutes. I like the multiple uses of the cards and how balanced everything seems to be. (No card is ever THAT bad.) Also one of the only auction games I can think of that plays well with two.

Each turn snowballs into a very powerful endgame. Pretty basic mechanics, looking forward to adding the expansion elements to spice things up, although there seems to be a lot of unique content left out of this game, such is a kickstarter world. Includes Arctic Bounty

2015-07-28 : After 1 play : very thematic and fast playing game, but I feel that the processing vessel and shrimp licenses are a lot stronger than the other ones, so if you can get them early on you can build up a lead that’s hard to overcome by the other players. Need to play this again, this time stressing the importance of said licenses and see if more pressure is put in the auction of these licenses and it re-balances the game.

RATING: 2
This is very very similar to just the auction part of Outpost. Amazingly, it actually is a worse version of Outpost (which is a pretty bad game) because it amplifies the run away leader problem that plagues Outpost. It doesn't really have a mitigating factor of loss of factory building to compensate for the loss of a key bid.

There are easily situations where the first player can just win if for instance they get a Tuna boat turn one and all the other boats offered are processing or shrimp. 

Also, like Outpost, the game isn't particularly fun to play, while you're playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really enjoy this game and still discovering new efficiencies after 10+ plays.  It's amusing how you think one card or combination of cards is really powerful and then try the same combo in a subsequent game without luck.  All of the cards are useful depending on the order of the fishing licenses resulting in a more tatical than strategic game.  Can't wait for the upcoming expansion.

Very fun game.  Auction, set-collection, hand management, and engine building all in a tight little thematic package.  (And the maritime theme/art is absolutely fantastic.)

The game is really pretty straight forward, even though it does take a few rounds, or games even, to really get comfortable with the iconography and synergy between each of the different licenses and how they work within each of the steps (turn sequence) of the game.  

Lot's of fun in 30-45 minutes.

Has some good ideas and is short enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome. But definitely needs polishing. What you need in the game is a card engine but the powers that generate it appear only on certain licences. If you get them early in the game, you've got it made. If not, you're screwed. And the order in which the licences are available is random.

(all these from publisher [url=https://www.eaglegames.net/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=101511]here[/url]).

While initial impressions of Fleet suggest something small and light, this is a game that packs an enormous amount of punch, and rightly has to be considered one of the very best strategic card games to emerge from 2012. Everything fits together beautifully, and the artwork and theme enhance solid mechanics that give real options for strategic play in the context of a simple rule-set and very quick game-time. All in all, surely this is the kind of game that every designer would like to make: a small package that offers a great deal in terms of gameplay and strategic choices, without requiring complexity or enormous amounts of time. Gamers around the world will find much to appreciate in Fleet, and although it makes good use of familiar mechanics, it creates an experience that few other games in the same sized package can provide.

For two player game use the new rules: [thread=1233069][/thread]

A fun tableau building game. While it may not be completely balanced between the different licences, the game allows the players to balance it themselves through the auctions. I do wish that the boat cards were more differentiated between types instead of some types having the same VP's, coins, and cost to launch as others (e.g. if you have a Lobster and Processing Vessel license, launching either boat from your hand has the same effect on the game, but I wish SOMETHING was different on the boats). The bonus expansions are interesting, but I don't think they add too much to the game (although the Nunavut Weather Authority appears overpowered on first glance). The majority of decisions to be made in the game are during the auction round, which is good for me because that is a source of player interaction and it sets Fleet apart from other similar games. Another note: All the stuff you get barely fits in the box! I am not sure what I will do with the fish meeples I ordered.
Disclaimer: I won Fleet in a contest from the designers.

This game just seems really classy to me. It has some smart decisions to be made, a unique theme, and nice art. This is not going to make your top ten, but it will be a fun, low-key game to play when you're in the mood for it.

Although the rules are terribly written (and with almost no examples) and unclear, I think we eventually understood them. This one could grow to be one of my favorite fillers. The reason is that I don't know any other engine builder games that takes less than 30 minutes to play. No new mechanics, but the system works really well.

Really nice auction bidding game with a fishing feel, but its a bit slow in that after making a bid for a license it usually takes you 2-3 turns to recover enough to buy another license. 

I believe this is part of the strategy as whilst the shrimp license gives you a discount off purchasing licenses others such as the cod/lobster give you cards, which are used as a bidding resources therefore they help you get back into the game quicker.

Interesting, unique theme.

After playing a couple more times, I downgraded this.  The rules and edge cases seem like it needs more polish.  The icons aren't intuitive, and it was annoying to remind people what phase we were in all the time, and when they could use their bonuses.

I Love the art work. I like the different uses of the cards. I think this game is missing alot. Being a fishmen myself, I bought the game because I wanted to feel like I was fishing. But there is no sense of "fishing" at all!! Just catching. So we incorporated a rule that you must roll for every boat fishing. 1-4 one fish cube. 5 and 6 no fish cube.

I have yet to introduce any expansion cards into the game yet so as it sits I grade it a 6. With my house rule a 7.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
I really like this game.  

But Wow.  The rule book needs a serious re-write.  Please give us some large illustrations and re-format the thing.   Game play is not clear despite the step-by-step procedure.  After 2 false starts I managed to complete a game and discovered, that yes I like Fleet.  But my gaming group was not so patient.  One player hates it and the others felt it was mediocre.  I cannot help but think that if the rule book had been better that my friends would have had a better experience.  
 
For example, the guys didn't understand the value of multiple licenses of the same type (as opposed to multiple boats of the same type) until we were well into the game. 

I would suggest that first time players begin the game with a random license (either everyone gets a processing vessel license or everyone gets a random fish/lobster/shrimp license) in order to lessen the learning curve.

That said, this is a very fun game.  Now that I know it well, it is pretty straight-forward to teach and folks seems to enjoy it.  A lot of game in a small (perfectly sized) box.

Első két játék után tetszik. Van benne kombinációs lehetőség, kicsit olyan glory to rome light. Nem feltétlen egy út vezet a győzelemhez. Gyors, egyszerű, kicsit komolyabb filler. Egyetlen hibájának azt érzem, hogy nagyon be is lehet ragadni benne, ha az ember kicsit hibázik és utána meg pechje van.
7.8

Egyre jobban tetszik. Észnél kell lenni végig, és balanszírozni, hogy csődölj be.

->8

Több játék után kezdem kicsit úgy érezni, hogy 80%-ban azon múlik minden, hogy ki hány tunát húz. Persze el lehet rontani egy jó húzást is, de ha nem hibázik nagyot az ember, akkor kicsit 60 perces kockadobás feelingje lesz a dolognak.

->7.5

Még több játék után megint egyre jobban szeretem. Jó a hangulata, valahogy mindig van kedvem hozzá.

-> 8.5

A kieg kijövetele után kiderült, hogy lehetett volna elsőre is jóra csinálni azt a fránya licitet. :) Így ezt egy kicsit "lehúzom" a kieget meg az egekbe tolom.

Fleet is a tight snowball game that works pretty well as a short engine builder. Contrary to what one might expect when rolling a short snowball, however, the game feels somewhat static and unimaginative. The auctions in particular are typically not very lively at all despite taking a very prominent role in the game, and while this may change at some key points during a play I wonder whether there isn't a better solution to license distribution.

Despite the auction mechanic, Fleet doesn't really feel like an auction game. Instead the focus is on hand management and building up the set of cards in front of you. In those respects it reminds me of San Juan, however I think Fleet offers more depth.

Nice card game; with a different yet meaningful theme.  Only played it with 2, which I think with extended play would be less enjoyable (as you tend to play to stop the other player); but I would think It's even better with 3-4 players.  So, rating of 7 (Aug 2014). UPDATE: Played with 4 and even better game; rating increase to 8 (Aug 2014). UPDATE: 3SF (Rating 8.143, Dec 16)

Fleet was actually better than I was expecting. Not that I wasn't expecting a good game, but when you read the rules you believe right off the bat that it will be rather straightforward. Really, it actually has some decent complexity and lots to think about as you play cards as either boats, captains, or for money- in a way it feels a little like San Juan in that regard. The theme might not be to everyone's liking, but thank the goodness of all things theme that at least it's different! And as a Canadian, it's nice to play a game that is actually set here! (Though Nunavut is to us what Alaska must be to Americans).

This game is really neat, but man, the set up is insane!  I didn't play the base game until I got the kickstarted Arctic Bounty expansion, and the simple task of organizing the cards and setting up each play has been obtuse to say the least.  I've found some really helpful set up guides, but at least for now, the set up time is almost as long as the game play.  Hopefully that will change, but if the set up continues to prove cumbersome, I may look to sell or trade this one.

After 7 plays, I feel like I should comment on this game. It does a few things really well, but doesn't leave enough room for real strategy. It plays smoothly, deceptively easy, and is as a result very easy to introduce to "non-gamers". But it also has some meat on its bones because the auctions and hand management give the players just enough control to feel like they deserve their win/loss.  However, the snowball effect in this game can be a problem since, without any catch up mechanic, the leader tends to stay in the lead. But for all these criticisms, I do enjoy playing this game and I can see it hitting the table more still because of its short play time and accessibility.

At first blush I thought it was pretty terrible. Everything is so expensive and takes so long to build, and if you fall behind the curve in the first couple turns you're never going to catch up.

The bidding is okay if you like bidding & it's pretty simple to play. Artwork is pretty good.

RATING: 8.2
Easy to understand rules, short gameplay but with deeper strategy. Somewhat Glory to Rome light, with multi purpose cards and comboing. The theme didn't catch me at first, but after two plays i like it because it is unique. The license cards size are bullshit, as you cannot buy proper sleeves for them. There are like 25 card sizes already, i don't understand why they can't choose from them. I feel that the game is shouting for an expansion or two because it is too light for my taste. Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy are better games of this genre, but to keep up the variety it has a place on my collection. Because the game is cheap i can feel high value on this one.

Pros / Cons:
-Easy to understand rules, but somewhat deep strategy.
-Multi purpose cards with great ability of comboing.
-Unique theme
-Good price / value on this one.

-Odd cards sizes, which you cannot buy sleeves for.
-The game is too light, and is shouting for an expansion or two.
-Lack of player interaction is a big downfall.

Well, I am glad we played this twice - I wasn't entirely sure whether I liked it after the first play (partly because I didn't see a tuna boat in the entire game (other than the one in my starting hand and the game ended 41-X-X-70, which was a bit too spread out for my taste); I didn't seem to have enough influence of the game after falling behind early. The second play was a lot more even, and much more interesting. 
Interaction is only in the auctions, but then it can be fierce; especially early on in the game. There are some ideal moves in the beginning (so being starting player matters!), but the game unfolds to a nice experience. Plus it's in a small box. A keeper.
Edit after the third play: My wife wasn't as fond of it as I had hoped, so I decided to sell it after all. I still recommend it to anyone attracted by the theme at all.

I backed this on Kickstarter.  The game feels unpolished—there are places where it just doesn't make a lot of sense, and it really feels like the cards were finalized before the rules.  Even if it worked perfectly as intended, it's still a rather boring math and luck game.  I'm also not that keen on the artwork.

RATING: 10
Screw it, this baby's getting a 10 from me.  Even when I do horribly, I always have a great time playing Fleet.  The variability of license availability guarantees each game will require a different strategy, and every decision feels important.  A brilliant design.

Original Review:

For the short playtime and ease of rules, Fleet probably has the best strategy/fun "value" of any game I own.  A seemingly simple game that really rewards thought and careful planning.  It takes a little while for new players to get their heads around the gameplay, which is unfortunate as establishing a strong opening position is essential to scoring well.  However, once everyone is up to speed the game hums along at a brisk pace and reaches a somewhat Zen-like state as everyone plays and draws cards right on cue.  Plus it has auctions, which I love.  A great game to bring out when you're done with a multi-hour brain-burner and you want a short game with some depth to it.

Played this game over the weekend and played with kickstarter stuff. The KS stuff seemed over powered and might be the cause for the game being so bad. Sometimes you have to sit for 3 plus turns just waiting to build money to make a purchase which is a bad thing. You sit down to play a game not pass pass pass. The weather advisory card ruins the already broken mechanic of richer get richer in this game.

Juego de gestión de recursos ligerito basado en la adquisición de los diferentes tipos de recursos, contratos pesqueros y barcos básicamente a través de subastas.

Se trata de manejar una compañía pesquera en la que iremos adquiriendo contratos que nos permitirán pescar diferentes tipos de peces, para lo cual a su vez tendremos que adquirir barcos que puedan pescar este tipo de pez. Los peces una vez pescados los cambiaremos por pasta por puntos para poder entrar en las posteriores subastas.

after 1 play:

The auctions early on are a bit rubbish, only getting more interesting in the mid game. As a result of this, it's entirely possible for there to be a run away leader with other players being unable to force each other to pay heavily for the best license cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a card game in which the cards in your hand are money, fishing boats, or boat captains, depending on when and how you play them.  You buy fishing licenses at auction, which dictate which types of boats you can launch and also give you special powers.  It has a few twists on the tableau game, but nothing that had me itching for more.

Initial Rating: N/A

I made a critical mistake explaining the rules. The unsold licenses were removed each turn so the game was extremely short. Due to this I can’t give the game a fair rating so I will play again to properly rate.

For now, I can say I heavily dislike the theme but if the gameplay is good enough I can disregard this. The rules are easy to teach so I hope to play it again soon.

After more plays, I can see that Fleet can be a good auction game. I still need more plays to properly gauge but I really like the multiple uses of the cards (boats, captains, money), they are reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy, a game I love. The decisions are not trivial (a huge plus for me). The rules are easy to teach.

I’m worried that the Processing License is too  powerful (furthermore if you can get one early on), in our games the players who had it were the ones fighting for victory, the ones that didn’t had it were out of the game.

As I said before I despise the theme, I need to play more to see if I’m going to hang onto this.

Current Rating: 5.0

After even more plays, I decided to sell the game. It’s not a bad game, but not thrilling enough for me, besides I hate the theme.

The processing license is very powerful, but not as much as I initially thought.

So far only played it solo. That didn't feel particularly exciting. Decisions are very often obvious and while different strategies are possible, they're mostly determined by luck of the draw, and appear to lead to similar outcomes.
Also, the default AI captains are too weak.

But I haven't completely given up on it yet. I've yet to try the PnP Captains, most of the expansion cards and fan-created variants. We'll see...

Update: tiring of this, it's feeling like it's all about efficiency with little interaction, theme (beyond the attractive artwork, it could be about anything) or fun.
........
Tight, interlocking mechanics mean good decision making is rewarded. 

As a rule, Euro mechanisms in a card game format work well for me. Coming from a wargaming background, I tend to appreciate games that reward adaptability through the ability to rethink strategy when things change (as is often the case with more involved card games).

Maximising the flow of cards through your hand seems important in Fleet, as it does in many hand-management games, although there comes a poiint when the focus moves from maximising hand size to maximising points. Early acquisition of a shrimp and a processing ship licence worked well for me, but there are other ways of achieving card throughput. 

Getting a spread of licences early on keeps your boat launching options open, as you can back yourself into a corner by focussing on buying multiple copies of one or two licences early on.

A decent card game in which you and your fellow fleet owners buy your licenses to send ships out and fish the Canadian arctic. It's got some nice mechanics and offers some fun, but it's hard to catch up to a runaway fisherman (like, it's as if you're chasing the Americans in a Canadian shipping vessel without former MP Tobin in it!). The promos and expansions aim to make this game more varied and challenging.

HUGE PLUS: theme

MINUS: missing that one thing to up the intensity

Excellent little engine builder with tough choices and the right play time.  

Good theme that is different enough and well matched enough to the gameplay that it stands out.  

It can be difficult to remember every rule during every phase if you try and move briskly through it to keep playtime down, but (as I've mentioned before) this is due to infrequent play more than anything else.  With a few more plays, I wouldn't foresee it being a problem.

Pivotal is the auction of fishing and processing licenses. Cards are multi-functional and serve either as money, boats or captains. Managing the hand more efficiently and a bit of luck of the draw determine the winner. 

I can't lay my hand on why Fleets left me cold. Probably, various strategies are possible. I just don't have any interest in exploring this game more. Completely workable, unremarkable and ultimately an expendable card game.

Surprising how many areas this game satisfies. Not too long, not too big, easy and fun to understand. A theme I love and silky smooth mechanisms. 

My only negatives might be the rarity that people would bid for much more than the minimum licence costs. It becomes too detrimental further past that point in a lot of instances. This makes the outcomes quite predictable and rarely hard-fought. 
Also some personal quibbles on the strengths of certain licences over others, but that is solved by the nice variety introduced by the Arctic expansion. Thank you for this product.

Why I don't like the game:

1.  There is a player order imbalance.  The money is too tight so you cannot overbid in the first round.  This means that the first players gets the best cards and goes on to win.
2.  The licenses are unbalanced.
3.  The setup with the arctic expansion takes way too long.
4.  Some expansion/promotional items are way too powerful (salty captain).

After 2 games:

I flamed out in my first game, having sunk myself on the first move of the game (my opinion). Determined to do better, I got a Shrimp, Lobster, Processing Vessel, and then a Tuna license. This allowed me to get many more cards than everyone else. This is really an engine building (economic snowball) game where you get income (cards) early and switch to victory points later. Despite not switching to victory points wholeheartedly at the end, my lead in income still got me the win. We played with the Salty Captain and the Inuit Fisherman. My opinion of the Salty Captain is that it promotes "the rich get richer" and can produce a runaway winner. I think the game is better without it.

Közepesen nehéz licitálós, tablóépítős kártyajáték hajós, halászos tematikával. Egészen hangulatosnak, kellemesnek mondanám. A licitálás részét elég lájtosnak éreztem, négyesben játszottuk, senki sem akart görcsösen megkaparintani valamit, viszonylag kevés emelés volt. Azt éreztem, hogy nem lehet olyan nagyon rosszul húzni, mindig van mit csinálni, de az is igaz, hogy kiegészítővel játszottuk, ami javít néhány hibát. A játékidő rövid, kis túlzással fillernek is elmegy, kellemes szórakozás, de talán a témára fogékonyabbaknak lehet érdekesebb.

RATING: 6
Nice auction and tableau building game. I don't quite see the synergy comparisons to Race for the Galaxy - strategies are generally locked from capturing specific licensees. Still it's not bad and more enjoyable with larger numbers of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Calling this an 8, but that's almost certainly inflated by its status as my newest game.  Plays fast; once everyone knows how to play, everything except the auction can be done simultaneously.

Since the only interaction between players is the auction, I was worried that it just wasn't going to be very good 2-player, but after several plays that way, I think it's good.  Sometimes it's pretty obvious mid-game that it's all over for one player, but at least that means the beating won't last too much longer.  [i]Update:[/i] let's say "OK" 2-player.

One serious problem is that I keep losing, and I have no idea why.

Update: I like this game a lot, and intend to get it again, but gave my copy to Brad S. as a going-away present.

RATING: 5
Played three times, 4p.  Again, my expectations hurt an otherwise fine game.  First, the game looks really good; the graphic design is TOP notch.  I think I was expecting a deeper game, with more difficult decisions.  This is a fine filler, really, with rules that are deceptively difficult to explain.  This is really a game of cash management; you have to spend money to make money, but diversifying too soon may not payoff in the end.  I'm not sure this game is playable out of the box.  In each game, the game has locked down, as the auction market completely bogged down with cards that only one player could afford, and, when they did eventually buy them, simply leapt further ahead.  I think this game requires a house-rule or rules tweak.

I really enjoy this game.  It's light enough to play in a short window of time with kids playing in the next room, but it's deep enough that it scratches that strategy itch.  This game is unique.  I don't think I have any other games that are quite like it.

RATING: 7
Underneath the dull cover art and poor title (who hears "Fleet" and mentally prepends "Fishing" instead of "Naval"?) there's a pretty tight economic/hand-management game here. I like the San Juan-ish "cards are everything" (nearly) aspect, and the different powers of the licenses were interesting. I want to explore this a little more, but at the moment it seems like Processing Licenses are something you just plain can't have a fighting chance without, as they give the potential for both card and economic dominance. (I'll tell you this for free: you can't win with a Shrimp Strategy if only one Shrimp license comes out before the second-to-last round. So much for my dreams of a "Shrimpire".)

This game suffers a bit of runaway leader and the how the resource conversions work is sound really unintuitive until you actually play a round or two, but it has a nice engine building feel with a hand management aspect with it, and the theme is fairly fresh despite being not gelling completely with the mechanics (what is the thematic reason for tuna letting me draw more cards)?

RATING: 4
I wanted to like it, but it left me completely cold. Between the badly-writte manual, and the possibility of overbidding in the first turn (which we both did), it made for a rough game. There's a strong dissonance between theme and mechanics (a processing boat also catches fish, and there's no difference at all between shrimp boats and tuna boats once they're out).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fleet is an interesting mix. It has the auction system of Power Grid, though no replenishment between the auctions, and it has the tableau building plus the engine building of Race for the Galaxy.

It's clean and simple yet still feels a bit meaty and gives a satisfying sense of accomplishment; all in a 30-40 minute play time. 

The only downer is that the theme isn't very exciting, but the game is good enough that it doesn't detract from the experience either.

My rating may yet go up with more plays and use of the expansion materials, which are surprisingly modular.

RATING: 6
A preliminary comment (and not rating it yet): Reflecting upon the game, both of us enjoyed it for what it was but I was hoping for more real decisions - not sure how to put it, but with the license requirement, the limited card drawing and money being tight, your options on your turn are limited almost to the point of singularity, especially early in the game. And the end game is almost the opposite, no real decision-making because you can do much more and so it is just what scores the most?

That all said, it seems to tickle my brain in some way because I have been thinking about it since playing. Adding in the Captain and the Inuit will give more on board options. Plus a big plus for the smooth game play. There is partly my expectation, that this is another Race for the Galaxy level short-but-dense game. A high mark to reach. We'll give it some more table time.

Update: I've tried a couple times to get this to the table, but my wife just didn't warm to it. So it goes to the trade/sell pile.

A very different game with a unique theme.  You are acquiring fishing licenses and putting out fishing boats and captains to acquire fish.  Each license has a power.  If you acquire more licenses you get more powers.  The game also has special end of game point scoring licenses.  It has very simple mechanics and is a light Glory to Rome in some ways.

seemed too short for plans or decisions to make enough of a difference.  A trend I've seen with games of this quick euro thought, a fad that I hope doesn't last too long.  That was their goal so its not like its broken or even that negative of a observation, I'm just not a fan of that feeling it gives you.  That build up build up build up and no climatic payoff.

A defiant game to try for all but I think this design game plotline or whatever is very black or white if you like it or not.

A very easy to learn card game where you purchase fishing license to be able to fish 5 different types of delicious sea creatures.  After purchasing a license you can send those ships out.  Obviously they'll need a captain, so don't forget about that guy.  After that you collect crates of fish and can either use them as VP at the end of the game, or pick up a processing vessel license so you can get more cash for better stuff in the future.

Fun game with a little bit of strategy.  I recommend it.

Excellent card game, even better than I anticipated! Fleet checks so many of my boxes. 

Pros:
1. Scalability: plays REALLY well with 2 players. That's all I've played it with and it's definitely not lacking at that number. There are always tough decisions to make. Plus, my wife and I are usually pretty close in score.
2. Gameplay: Streamlined and silky smooth.
3. Components: Easily the best card quality I have seen in any game. The wooden bits and box are quite nice as well.
4. Fun: I have fun with most auction games, but this one is a cut above.
5. Theme: I really feel, for the most part, like I'm catching and processing fish. 

Cons:
1. Directions could have been written better, or perhaps better laid out. 


If you like auction games, and you play two-handed quite a bit, pick this game up NOW!

10/20/14 Obtained. I have what I assume is a game from the third print run with the "corrected" box insert. To some degree including in the box the rules to the five expansion card types is sort of a slap in the face, as the extra cards were only included for those that backed the game initially on Kickstarter. That gave me sort of a "Ha-ha , guess what you'll never have!" feeling. 
12/20/14 Played a three-player game. 
Fleet has a theme unlike my other games (fishing). The theme is integrated very well into the mechanics; something many Euros games often don't do well. The rules, cards, and cubes are first class. The rules are clear. There are several different strategies one can employ which will keep the game fresh.

It took a game or two for me to start to appreciate this, but it quickly grew on me and I have enjoyed several plays of it.  Resources are tight which requires good strategic decisions.  Effectively utilizing the licenses toward a winning strategy comes with a solid understanding of the game, but encourages multiple plays and trying different approaches.  The theme is great and well integrated into the gameplay and it certainly has a unique feel, although I would maybe compare it a bit to San Juan.

A well-designed auction/hand-management/engine builder with cards that, like [thing=8217][/thing], have multiple uses. Everybody starts off relatively poor but as you build your fleet you gain special powers in addition to VPs. The powers are well-balanced to provide multiple paths to victory. That being said if somebody gets a good lead it would be tough to stop.  Not to worry though, it's a quick game.

The ambiguity of the iconography and a disagreement between the written rules and an example led to us arguing about how something got played for 20+ mins. It left a really bad taste in my mouth. Since then, I also find I don't enjoy this kind of point engine, combo building game very much. Great theme, though.

My first Kickstarter project to support. It was a great experience, and it produced a great game.  The auctions create a nice element that work well even in 2-player mode.  Feels like  Puerto Rico streamlined into a card game, that plays faster than PR.  Theme comes through largely do to the art rather than game mechanics, but it all works well together.

Fleet is a nice, short auction game.  The main activity is a power-grid style auction.  Then there is some  simultaneously-played tableau-building and fishing phases which gives a great sense of growth and development.  The game is economically tight and mistakes can be devastating: score do not clump together in this game.  Instead, mistakes compound upon themselves leading to pretty wide differences in what player capabilities and scores.

(Includes Arctic Bounty expansion.)

Sounds like a nice little game about fishing in the ocean. You acquire fishing licenses, boats, captains, and fish. Person with the most points wins. Non confrontational, good card options (don't get stuck easily) and good game length.

Sounds like a great addition.

Nice card-management game where cards can either be used for their own use, or as currency to buy other cards (similar to Rftg).  Some nice combinations can be built - key is getting the right licenses for the right price, and then taking advantage of your special abilities more efficiently than everyone else.  Works well with my 7-year-old girl as well.  A hit!

Fleet is a card game that uses bidding hand management and to a lesser degree set collection as its core mechanics.

The theme is that you are trying to build the best fleet possible to fish the newly found waters off Canada that are teeming with sea life.

Fleet is a quick game (about 20-30 minutes) that requires careful planning and execution (timing) to make the most of limited resources, which includes time. 

It plays best with 3-4 players simply because bidding and auctions are rarely at their best with only 2. 

The game has lovely visuals and the play is very engaging. 

I think Fleet is one of those rarer finds to come through Kickstarter, a new game with very good design. It looks great too.

A very "blah" experience. You start off with an auction, that's more often a card draft than anything else. Then you pay to put out boats that net you victory points and fish. Rinse and repeat. The game is a very soulless experience. Not to mention that it's extremely difficult to come back if you're not able to snag some good licenses from the get go. I feel like Shrimp and Processing Vessel licenses are almost completely essential, and if you lose out on them early on, you're pretty much screwed. This game needed something a little bit more...maybe more development...because while the game does have a tight economy, it's just not fun.

Add-on to my second KickStarter boardgame purchase.

Probably the best 'new to me' game that I have played so far this year (2014).  Yet to really explore its potential.  Loving the near endless modularity that 'Fleet' and 'Fleet: Arctic Bounty' provide right out of the box!

Looking forward to trying the 'Epic Fleet' variant at some stage!  :-)

A well-designed filler similar to San Juan, with cards serving as money as well as its face function. Very smooth game play with some decisions to make, and an overall pleasant gaming experience, however it seems to lack a bit in auction, card management and variety to make it a real challenging game, and as of now it's a fine but boring game. Probably needs an expansion.

Best played with 3.

RATING: 7.5
In this card game, players first bid for available licenses (lobster, tuna, shrimp, cod, king crab, processing). Each license gives you special benefits, such as giving you extra cards. Mulitple licenses of the same type will improve your benefit If you have the right license, you can launch a boat of the same type, and giving it a captain to earn fish cubes, which are 1 VP each at the end. 

This is a fun filler, with different approaches that are possible. The fun part is trying to make each different license work. I've played three times, and looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 6
Card game that's not quite deck building or drafting but has elements of both. Theme is to launch ships, recruit captains and then catch as much fish (victory points) as possible. The novel twist is the need for licences to catch each type of fish. Felt like I didn't have a lot of control over the game, all the new cards you receive are random; luck of the draw sometimes. There's also a small bidding /auction element, but you don't have a chance to respond (1 bid only). This is annoying, if you ration the bid with reasonable chance to win it, someone can go beat it and screw you over, despite that you could still win if you get to raise the bid. Thus seems annoying to feel you must bid the highest amount you have every time to get what you need. This also makes the game slow and uneventful as you have no other currency to do anything else your turn. I didn't like the theme of this one either, found it boring.

A pretty interesting auction game.  In the beginning of the game it starts with an auction to grab licenses.  With these licenses you send out ships to get fish that you eventually can turn into cargo or spend as cash to allow your engine to get you MORE fish the next round.

This auction card game is very good and I definitely should get this to the table again, soon!

The art in this game is excellent. The fun in this game is there, but it honestly seemed to end too early. If it wasn't for the auction, I would probably make a real effort to pick it up, but I don't think it would make a good 2 player game.

A good short game (a little more than a filler). Cards are used as currency to pay for other cards, á la RftG. It's an engine builder, and there is a small learning curve, but most players have an idea of strategy after a couple of games. Not a game I love, but certainly OK.

[b]Fleet[/b] was sold via auction 7/20/17.
Was received in a trade (12/29/14). 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I wish I could get this game to the table more often. I love the combination of the multi use cards, tableau building (playing fishing boats) and auctions (to buy fishing licenses). Surprisingly my daughter ended up enjoying this one more than my son and she's become quite a good player. It's also been popular with other people I've introduced it to. 

As I thought, it definitely shines with 3+ players (although it's still fun with 2 as long as you have the expansion). The Gone Fishin card should be included in every play (it gives you 2 coins if you don't end up getting a license), it's included in the Arctic Bounty expansion. There are a lot of different combos to explore especially once you include the expansion. Set up is my one major gripe, but there is nothing you can really do about it if you want to add variety to each game experience (you need to make both the license and boat decks before each game by choosing a certain number based on player count). Once set up it plays at a brisk pace with very little downtime. 

Fleet has become one of my personal favorites and a game I will gladly play any time.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7):[/COLOR]

[i]- Really nice artwork and components. The card quality is outstanding.
- Employs one of my favorite mechanics, using cards for multiple purposes.
- The auctions add something new to this type of game [i](I am comparing it to a game like [thing=28143]Race[/thing]).[/i]
- Played well with two using the captains from Arctic Bounty.
- Fairly straight forward game to learn/teach, could definitely be a family game in my house.
- Plays quick, almost too quickly, but I am not sure about this yet. It may have been the result of using the salty captain cards.

I thought the 2p experience was good, but I think it would be much better with more players. That is the sticking point for me, I know my son would dig it but not sure about my daughter and wife. In my opinion you still can't beat 2p [thing=28143]Race[/thing] when it comes to this type of game. 
However; I really enjoyed the auction mechanic.

Quick update: my daughter loves it![/i]

A really nice meaty fillery card game. Your cards are fishing boats but they double up as currency San Juan style. As currency, they can be spent to buy licences in the auction phase each round (in Power Grid style, can buy 1 per turn, etc). These licences give you straight VPs but more importantly they give bonuses each turn - more cards, discounts, double-up abilities and the like. Your choices as to what licences / bonuses you want, and how much you're prepared to pay for them, is key, and there's a lot to explore here - which bonuses are the most powerful and therefore how do you value each bonus, what's cheap and what's expensive. Once you have a licence, you can spend more money (ie boat cards from your hand) to actually deploy one of your boat cards as a boat, which is the second way of earning VPs, and that boat will rack up a VP each turn catching fish as well. So another thing to explore is when it's better to just spend your boat cards buying licences and when to actually deploy your boat cards as, well, boats. There's the auction phase which goes pretty quickly as money tends to be tight, and then everyone processes the remainder of their hand (buy boats, get fish, draw cards) simultaneously, which leads quickly to the next round and the next auction. So there's little downtime and the game plays pleasingly quickly. The components are great, nice artwork, and the theme is excellent for a game of this weight. I look forward to playing more.

This is one of my stranded-on-an-island games !!

Awesome hand-and-resource-management commercial-fishing-boat-themed game. Auctions for commercial licenses. Boat cards can be used as boats, captains, or money. Very cool game play feel. This is a modern day classic. Fleet is the kind of game you'll see played at conventions and deer camps.

Excellent with 2,3, and 4 players. Good graphics and game design. Rulebook a little fiddly; needed 3 quick thorough reads to finally get all the rules down.

RATING: 7.5
After first try: 

Played three games in a row, partly because it's a good game and everyone wanted to try again, and partly because it only takes 30-45 min to play. 

When looking at the rules and game parts before reading them I wondered how do you need this much rules for that little stuff, but after reading the rules I understand. The actual rules are quite simple and short, but the rulebook also contains a really good explanation of cards and gameplay. This is probably the best written rules I have read in a long time, I give the rulebook a solid 10. Every time a question occured during play it took 10 seconds to look it up and is was always very clear what the rules meant. 

Ok, how about the actual game then? Well it has very few different components and quite simple ones. Combine that with short playing time our expectations was a simple fillerlike game. But we were wrong. It's easy to learn but has quite deep complexity since you can combine the special functions of the licenses in many many ways. 

After first game we decided that owning a Processing Vessel License was crucial to win, so for the second game I had to try without, and was successful. But it is more important to do exactly right if you don't have it. With it you always make the extra money to get everything rolling. Without it you can be locked down with one boat full of fish and not enough money to launch new boats, especially if you don't draw the boatcards that you have licenses for. That killed one of the players in the first game.  

What we found was crucial though was to make the economy going and the easiest way to do that is with shrimp boats. All three games was won by the first buyer of a shrimp boat license. As long as you draw shrimp boats you can launch them for free and get more and more fish. 

Look and feel of the game is great. Everyone appreciated the artwork and wanted to place their captains under the boat cards to be able to see the pictures :-) My prototype copy, I believe, has larger license cards than the production copies. It's a pity they haven't kept the size even though the table got a bit crowded. My copy also have little wooden fishes instead of cubes. Even if cubes are more representative for crates, I really like the wooden fish, and every game has cubes. This is more unique. 

One more thing that came up when we played it again: 
In the last round after endgame is triggered you will often be able to draw several cards. There should be some points for cards at the end of the game. Maybe 1/3, just so drawing cards in the end round has some meaning.

More comments after more play:
I have noticed that first time you play the game you decide that some license is better than another and beginners overbid each other a few times. Shrimp and lobster are popular start-licenses, or sometimes processing vessel. After a few games, though you realize the licenses are very balanced and you get about the same start with any, so I tend to sit back and take whatever is left over for the minimum price, thus having more cards over for next round. 

It's also more and more obvious that drawing the wrong cards can set you back so much you can't recover. This has happened to one player in about every second game I've played. Of course these guys have rated the game low. If you are observant though you can always escape from that by buying the right licenses, or not buying a license to save money, but if you make one mistake you are behind for the rest of the game.

This game surprised me. Thematically, I didn't want to buy it. It just didn't appeal to me, and I didn't get past that to even see mechanically how it played. I turned it down from purchases 4 times in the last 2 months. Girlfriend really wanted it though and she's my main gaming partner. If she wants it I'll get it, So I did. Boy was I surprised! I love this game. I'm into the Theme these days as well. SO much that I had to get the fish meeple, the crab meeple, that oversized goofy wooden die that's completely useless, all the expansions which actually do add a lot of variety to the game, and the big box. Every time I bring it out The Bon Jovi song (you know which one) starts playing in my head. I don't mind though, It makes me chuckle. I keep wanting to play it over and over again That I keep forgetting to log my plays, and in case you haven't seen from my collection, I keep tabs of my plays pretty religiously. 

oh yeah, The cardstock! these are the beefiest cards I own. other games could learn from this one in terms of card quality. They are like tanks.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: A light card game with enough strategy that gamers will like it and non gamers can play it. You first auction licenses that let you launch boats and captains. This is all done with the same cards so you must manage your hand and you never have enough cards. Then you get fish that are points o can be converted in some instances to more cards or cash. A fairly good game, but there are others that I would rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good tableau builder that has an auction phase creating a little more interaction than your average tableau builder.  The auctions can occasionally be a tad stale due to the fact that all the licenses available are valued about the same to all players and hence everyone just pays face value for one.  Hence, it becomes more of a draft than an auction.  Occasionally the fight over a license heats up, but it seems rare to be advantageous to pay more than a dollar or two over face value. The iconography is a tad wonky and the license bonuses can be tough to explain, especially how a couple of them "stack".  Also, the box may suggest a small box card game, but it requires just as much table space as most board games.  On the positive side, the gameplay is interesting and it is a game that deserves a few plays a year.


UPDATE:  The Arctic Bounty expansion makes the auctions far more interesting and takes up a notch or two.

Fleet is an engine-building card game that uses cards for resources, a little like Race for the Galaxy.  There's also an auction element thrown in.  It's pretty meaty for a card game with a relatively short play time.  There's really quite a bit going on, so it can be a little overwhelming for new players, but once you get the hang of it, everything seems to work together pretty well.  Once you get a few plays under your belt, this game really begins to shine as you understand the mechanisms.

Comment: Finally a fun game about fishing. Turns are relatively quick, most of the game is pretty simultaneous and there are plenty of decisions to be made. Set up is a bit fiddly, but nothing too outlandish. Processing Vessel seems to be a bit strong, but I think with repeated play, it will be less sought after. Auction works ok with 2 players. Cards are great quality.

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 3 > 2
Plays well with all player counts.

While the cards have multiple uses in this game they don´t offer you deep strategic choices but are rather straight forward and limited. I´m okay with simpler designs, but then I´d expect the game to take less time to play. The artwork and theme are very nice though.

I'd like to play this more, I've really enjoyed the two plays so far.  It feels like a simpler Race for the Galaxy, as you tableau builds you start setting off awesome synergies and combos.  Simple rules and mechanics that lead to a satisfying strategic card game.  Plus, the artwork is great and helps evoke a unique theme (even if it is simply veneer).

Looking forward to the expansion, the two-player variant will help this get more table time.

Rating changed from a 7 to 9.5. After a couple of games I am hooked. I have to agree that the base set you need to bring your A game because it is hard to rally back from a mistake. The cards are great, the rules are simple and if you make mistake the game is over quick. We got two 2 player games in within a half hour. One thing, do watch the play through reviews on YouTube as it will clear up a lot. This game is a must have in my book.

Good game, like the mechanism where you use the cards for several different things. Wasn't convinced after it was explained to me, and I'm not really into the theme, but it's a really nice game, we ended up getting our own copy (and the expansion) after 2 plays.

RATING: 8.5
I love the mechanism of using cards for multiple purposes. For me, it creates really interesting decisions. The auction is really fun and interesting with four, ok with three, and pretty dull with two players. The other elements (when to use a card for purchasing a license, when to launch, when to captain) is equally interesting across player count. The game is a 10 for me with 4 players, but I usually have two players, so I'm giving it a 9.

This is a very nice, richly thematic game about trying to carve out a fortune from recently opened fishing waters off the coast of Nunavut. The game is very strategic, rewarding players for careful planning, decisive action, and subtle bluffing. The game is greatly enhanced by picking up some of the promotional cards that are not available with the base game and with the addition of the Arctic Bounty expansion.

A fast, strategic card game with a lot of interesting choices. I like the multi-use cards, which make you decide whether to use them as money, boats, or captains. I like the auctions for licenses, especially at higher player counts. I like the engine building, with a good ramp up from pretty slow at the beginning to feeling very effective by the end of the game. Many engine-building games end before I feel like I've really got something satisfactory running, but not this one. The only downside I can think of is that it takes longer to set up than I would expect for a pretty quick game.

My one play of fleet thus far was quite interesting. This has a little bit of a Race for the Galaxy feel with the cards being so multi use including as a currency. But the differences are that this game includes an auction element and has only six different types of cards in the main deck whereas Race for the Galaxy practically everything is unique. 

For a variety of reasons I much prefer this. I think it is a bit more of a strategic game rather than an almost purely tactical one that RftG is which is my major complaint. I also really like the auction element. 

I got smacked in my first game, and the most experienced player won in a landslide. In my opinion this is a great sign that this game has significant and interesting depth to explore. I already know several mistakes I made and look forward to playing more an improving. 

If the game strategy is as deep as I suspect and multiple plays continue to reveal emergent properties of the various interactions leading to ever tenser decisions, I suspect this game will rise to an 8 or maybe even 9. Hoping to get this played more often to find out.

Received yet another unsolicited "Fleet is awesome, you should try it" comment via geekmail so I pulled the various boxes off the shelves. Discovered that the SWAN LOTR sleeves _do_ fit, they're just very tight and you have to trim them down. Took about an hour to get the license cards sleeved. Watched a few playthroughs (including Arctic Bounty) and am now eager to try it!

[-]= 2015-05-31 - R:?

After receiving a very nice geekmail from another BGGer, I've decided to remove my '2' rating. I was frustrated that day. I had just received a shipment of various SWAN sleeves and still none of them fit. The 2 rating was petty.

= 2015-04-14 - R:2

Still trying to find sleeves that fit these f**king license cards. Giving the game a rating of 2 because the bullshit custom card size makes this an "extremely annoying game". It may be petty, but "upgrading" the cards to this size was unnecessary and inconsiderate. On the plus side, this game taught me to pay more attention to card sizes and I now just avoid anything that can't be sleeved (including anything that uses square cards that are actually worse to shuffle after they're sleeved)[/-]

= 2014-03-04

With the arrival of Arctic Bounty from the kickstarter, I believe I now have every single expansion and promo for this game. Now if I could just find the sleeves to fit these stupid sized cards, I could actually play the damn game.

Not sure about this one. The gameplay seems solid enough, but the theme bores me to tears and it's clear certain strategies are way better than others. i guess that's why you have to bid the cards up during the auction phase, but it never seemed like there was enough money circulating to make things interesting. I'll have to give it another try.

There is an interesting puzzle occurring in this game however, it ends quickly and there is a real sense of wanting more when it ends.  However, once we added some of the promos (salvage yards, salty captains, Inuits, etc)  the game became a lot more interesting.   You do get this sense of building a fishing fleet.  The base game is just blah to me though but this rating reflects some add-ons.  I really look forward to the Arctic Bounty expansion as I think the game will on get better with more of everything.

I'm not sure why this game seems to be so popular, to be honest. One member of my local games group kickstarted it and it has seen moderately regular play - but, while being a decent enough game, it's just not really particularly interesting. At first it reminded me a little of both Glory to Rome (in that each card has several potential uses - as money, as a ship, or as a captain), and of Race for the Galaxy (only in that you pay for playing cards by discarding other cards). But bringing up these comparisons - to two of my favourite card games - just highlights how laughably less interesting this game is than either of them. There is no variety of interesting cards and effects here - only around 5 (I forget the exact number) different types of card, all of which basically do the same thing once in play! What interest there is in the game is of course concentrated in the different licenses available and the auctions for them - and also the strategic tension between trying to get lots of the same licence (for enhanced effects of that particular type) and trying to get different types (so you can put more boats out - no good having 4 shrimp licenses and nothing else if you don't draw any shrimp boats). But I repeat what I said earlier, this is not a game with all that much interest, nor can I see it having very much replay value.

However, it is still fairly enjoyable when played occasionally, so I don't rate it lower than 6.

My friend feels we must have been playing some rules wrong (the rules are not well written), but I couldn't find any errors.  The game seems just totally dry and kind of pointless. I have not idea what the hype is about - I would always prefer San Juan or Race over this one.  The auctions for licenses are not fun, since you rarely have much money to bid high, and are guaranteed a license, so what's the point of bidding high.  And the theme is not that prevalent - I don't feel like I'm going out to sea to get fish.

RATING: 7
Fairly strategic little card game for the fairly heavy gamers. the game is not that difficult to understand but the decisions are fairly important in this game.  You are a fishing company that is trying to build your fleet and fish the Canadian waters. Each player receives a hand of cards that can be either money, captains or individual shipping boats. The players bid on licenses in order to launch fishing boats from their hand and catch fish, but paying to much could be detrimental to your future bids. Players must use their cards the most efficient way possible  to get the most points and decide whether to use the cards as money or ships or captains on their launched boats to their best ability.

Pros: Fast Gameplay, heavy decisions add meat to the game. Really fun theme, and art work on the cards is really well done.

Cons: Unforgiving for mistakes. First time players will lose and is difficult to catch up if left behind on point

Very San Juanish.  In theory an auction game but the auctions didn't generate much contention in my two plays.  The focus was more on fleet building and that provided plenty of options.  I'll be curious to find out how long the learning continues, because there is very little opportunity to have an impact on your opponents' positions.  You win this by making your own position pay.  If that part of the game continues to grow instead of falling into a single favored tack this will be a contender in the genre.

I did not play the optional rules though I did spin that big-ass wooden die which I could keep going for over a minute.  Nice die.

The directions on the cards could use a little improvement (a little more text specifically) but anyone coming from Race for the Galaxy will find this MUCH easier to learn and play in early games.  I love those big cards.

So doggone pretty.

Decent game in a small box. My back is always got up a bit by kickstarter exclusives - I don't like the idea that games are getting designed with bits that will taken out in the commercial edition - but I rather suspect that the simplicity of the base game benefits from lack of exclusive add ons. Very punishing, but mercifully over quickly. 2p is decent, but probably better to play something else.

There's a nice little auction game here that comes in at about 45 minutes. You're building up an engine to earn cards/money, while at the same time building up your victory points. Simple to play and with some interesting valuation decisions pointing in the direction you're interested in taking. Most of all it's got a nice thematic feel to it. The artwork and presentation is very satisfactory in this nice little package. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good, well put together and I'm interested in exploring more.

The opening auction can be critical because of the very limited starting funds. Starting order plays a big part in securing you a good (let's say shrimp) licence early on. A bid of six will cost you a minimum of three cards. You'll need to think hard whether you can afford to launch a boat in the first round if it effectively knocks you out of the second round of bidding. This, for me, is the hardest decision in the game.

Salty Sea Captains are very popular buys and worth it. Hard to say the same about the Inuit Fishermen.

If they made the cubes edible (and players had to eat them during scoring), by the second game you'd have a great metagame about overfishing and dwindling fish stocks.

I like the theme of this quite a bit, and I wanted to grade it an 8, but I'm still not sure if the cards are a bit too imbalanced.  It could have just been our inexperience with how much to pay for the cards.  Shrimp seem super-valuable, especially if someone is allowed to grab a couple of those.  I'm definitely willing to give this one another couple of plays with room for the score to go up...or down.

With each play of this, I find myself wanting to play it less.  I hate games where an early mistake cripples you and this seems to be one of those.  I like the idea of the game and I'm glad that it got produced, but my KS copy goes right to the For Trade list.

Fleet --

The theme held no interest for me, but Eric wanted to play it.  And Eric spends no small amount of time scouring BGG to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Once again, he picked a winner.

I've enjoyed every session, even when the luck of the draw limited my spending power at auction time.  Yes, Shrimp Licenses are always handy, but then so are  Processing Vessel Licenses.  And then there are those Cod Licenses.  And Lobster!  Can't forget Lobster Licenses!

What you quickly discover is that every basic license type is good, and while covering all those bases with a variety of licenses is nice, specialization is nicer.  

Last session, I drew a nice mix of Shrimp boats and Tuna boats.  The Shrimp were cheap to build and the Tuna gave me spending power at auction.  I would have felt a bit bad about the luck of the draw favoring me, but it so rarely does!  And besides, it was fun to be able to actually accomplish goals!

And [thing=144811]the Arctic Bounty expansion[/thing] broadens the possibilities without significantly impacting the feel.

This game is a surprise favorite.

Reading the rules first impressions put it into "San Juan goes even more euroey" - it has auctions. Also the split of the deck into licenses and ships feels a bit clunky at first. The card interactions are also a bit specific - it's licenses that grant you ship cards, but it's ships that gets you points (and money for auctions). And unfortunately the game comes with cubes (fish cardboard tokens anyone?). Theme didn't really do anything for me - makes sense though (except what fish the processing ships catch), art looks neat and appropriate. 

Playing solo (3 times) I saw the the game works and is interesting. The auctions feel like the best path towards getting the tableau building genre away from MPS territory. (take that elements never worked for me). Seems also that pacing is important - which licenses to get first, which can be acquired later. Weight wise, it's a bit more involved than San Juan. The only gameplay negative would be that it's a bit shame it's not as good for two. (auctions are to blame).

And my first play. This is great! It the best solution to the problem of interaction in tableau building genre, I've seen and it works. Though the game does not feature many individual cards it brings similar need to constant adaptation as RFTG but this comes from both the card draw and from other players at auctions. Another genius is having a common round all players go to - very similar in sense to Power Grid and as procedural (it can be quite a pain a first couple of plays for some). But it makes you very aware of how others are doing and how their engine runs, so it's possible to bid actively against a player who tries to pick a piece for their engine. In the end, most fun I get from it is watching my engine running and actively being hindered by opponents. So - a very good game. 

Unfortunately I don't think I'll ever own it - I don't like overall graphic feel enough. Many (older) players find it very beautiful, but it's very much not my cuppa. It's nice though for when I play with those "old geezers". ;)

Fleet is a tableau-building card game with a unique theme and solid gameplay, although it doesn't stand out from the pack. Players build up their titular fleet by purchasing fishing licenses, launching ships and hiring captains. The ships gradually harvest fish, which are a source of VP at the game end together with licenses and ships.

Despite appearing different initially, the gameplay ends up in very familiar territory. Those used to tableau-builders will find the strategy easy to slip into – licenses grant useful rule-breaking abilities, while card advantage is vital because cards double up as currency. But the familiarity is also a weak point, because Fleet doesn't do anything [i]new[/i] particularly well. The variable card composition is a so-so feature, and the auctions tend to chop up the flow of the gameplay. It's a decent addition to the roster nonetheless.

For what you get, this is a great game. Just a deck of cards and some cubes but the cards, much like Race for the Galaxy, work as multiple actions depending on what you want to do with them. We got off to a shaky start, going over rules that at times are a bit vague, but once you get the hang of it, a pretty good game.

RATING: 7
This is a nice little, quick-playing auction (Power Grid style), hand-management (like San Juan etc, with multiple-use cards) and set-collection card game! The rules and game play are very straightforward, but there are definitely decisions to be made throughout the game. The set-collection part is pretty cool, too:  collecting sets of licenses (multiple copies of the same type) give you better powers; of course, you also want to collect different types of licenses so that you have a variety of powers! 

Very fun game that I'll hopefully get to the table again!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
[u]Setup[/u]
Prepare the License deck (customized for number of players), then place n Licenses (1/player) face up on the table in Display. There are 4 of each type of fishing license in the deck, as well as some special "premium" licenses. Each fishing license modifies a player's actions, depending on the number of those licenses they have collected. Licenses also have VP value (4-9?).
Each player starts with the same 6 cards in hand -- one of each type of fishing boat in the game. The cards show coin values (1-3), launch cost (1-3), and VP value (1-3). Finally, place 25n fishing cubes in supply (remaining are removed from game).

[u]Each Round[/u]
1. Auction. Power Grid style auction, where Starting player puts a license from the display (minimum bid indicated on card) up for bid, players bid clockwise, max 1 license/player/round. In order, each player who hasn't won an auction gets to put something up for bid. Players are bidding with the coins on their cards in hand. At end of phase, replenish the License Display.
2. Launch 1 boat; Hire 1 captain. May launch a boat if you have the matching license and can pay the launch cost of the card. Also, may captain an uncaptained boat by placing any card face down on that boat.
3. Fish. Place 1 fish cube onto each captained boat, max 4/boat.
4. Process/Trade. [i]If you have the Processing Vessel license[/i], may move 1 fish/boat to the Processing Vessel; also, may remove 1 fish on PV from game to draw a boat card. Fish on PV may also be used in Auction (1 fish = 1 coin).
5. Draw 2, Keep 1 of them.
6. Pass Start Player marker clockwise.

[u]Licenses[/u]
Sets of licenses modify each of the steps above, depending on the number of licenses you own of that type. For example, one type of license gives the player virtual coins to use in the Auction and Launch steps; another allows you to use fish as money; another lets you draw cards when you Launch, etc. 

[u]Game End[/u]
The game ends at the end of the round when either you are unable to refresh the License Display, or all the fish have been removed from Supply. Players sum the VP values of their licenses and launched boats, +1/fish on boats (not PV), + any bonuses on the premium licenses.

RATING: 7
This is a simple and quick auction game.  Each turn players bid on licenses which will allow them to play specific kinds of fishing boats.  The licenses give players points as well as special abilities.

The neat mechanic in this game, one I tend to enjoy, is the multifunctional cards.  Each player has a hand of cards that can be played as a fishing boat given they have the necessary license, but also as different amounts of money to pay for auctions and boats, or played face down as a captain to collect fish on those boats (which is worth points and can also be used for some license abilities).

This is simple and plays quickly but has a little bit of depth and interesting decisions.  For a filler when you're in the mood to play an auction game this is a good option.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Auction and set collecting. You bid on licenses for certain type of fish and then you send out your ship to collect fish; the licenses, the fish and the ships all bring points and other advantages.
It doesn't sound great but we had a good time, I am a bit surprised I liked this that much. Given, I am easier taken in by card based games than other types, yet I usually don't like bidding much and the bidding phase is not my favorite in this game. So, "Fleet" is not overly exciting but I enjoyed it. Probably nothing to rush out to play again but happy to join in when brought up.

RATING: 4
Dreadful light engine-building game geared around an auction for fishing licenses, each of which allows a player to launch boats of that type. Licenses also provide special powers, e.g. each shrimp license permanently reduces both auction and boat launch costs. Captained boats collect a fish cube each turn, worth 1VP at the end of the game, and boats themselves are also worth points (cheaper boats have a lower value). 

The major problem, besides the fact that it's incredibly dry and with little variation, is that auction is uneven (some licenses are flat better than others at the start of the game) and there are strong rich-get-richer tendencies. The lumpiness of the auction is the only reason that the game doesn't seem completely decisionless, but that's because the space for actual interaction is so small. The fact that you can only launch licensed vessels the luck of the card draw can also be frustrating.

It is a wonder that this game is rated so highly. Boring, ugly, and seeming to teeter on the precipice of dysfunction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really liked this.  Not nearly as zany as many games of its type (Glory to Rome, Innovation), but it contains much less chaos and seems to have more strategic depth.  I love the look and feel of the components as well.  Rating could fluctuate on further play, and I suspect it will go up.

After a 2nd play: game might have a bit too much impact from luck in the early game, so I'm thinking the rating will stay an 8.  

I am by no means convinced, but it could be a pretty big factor.  I think if you don't have ships to play, getting 2 licenses early might be pretty good (I did that and handily won the game), but I'm not sure what you do if you don't get ships you can play, AND you don't get halfway decent money cards.  Seems like you fall behind, and though it's a short game, I'm not excited about being that guy.

After 4 plays: Nope, it's a 7.

Frankly I thought Fleet was going to be too light for me, but it's not - it is surprisingly engaging in an almost relaxing kind of way (as strange as that might sound).

I love the look, feel, and accessibility of Fleet - there is a lot of game in a small box, very well done. 

Heck, it is even a solid solo game when the urge to hit the open sea strikes since it's such a thematic design.

Strategic card game fun at its very best - one of my favorite game series!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Overly random economic-ish game. The game starts out so slow in building your engine that if you get bad draws the first two turns (like getting nothing but Shrimp and Lobster boats when your first License is anything but) you'll be left behind in the dust. Even worse when people get Processing Licenses and can convert fish to money and more cards -- the lack of a Processing License come up when someone else rushes it really gives that player a huge advantage. An advantage that you can't catch up to due to the economic nature of the game.

Plays relatively quickly once everyone gets the rules. Abut too fidgety in terms of the fine details of each license. I feel like I'm still referring to the rules pretty often. I love the theme, which was one of the big selling points for the kickstarter. That said, there is definitely not a whole lot of integration between theme and game play. This is all details of gameplay and really no evidence that there is any theme integration. It's still ok. But not picking it up as much as I would have liked. The fish meeples and extras from the campaign are great quality. A lot of variety of cards. This is a gamers game. Engine building with some auction. I guess I'm looking for a little more immersion with theme nowadays.

The more I play this game the more I enjoy it.  While I like the theme, a lot of people are put off when you describe it as a "fishing game".  However once they sit down and play it, I have yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy it.  

There is a lot of strategy here and even with as simple as the game can be, most players don't realize the full value of things like Processing Licenses until after their first game.

So play it (more than once) and don't underestimate the Processing License!

I liked the theme and some of the mechanics here, but found the balance off and the economy a bit fragile in my first play. Will have to try this again, but it seems like someone who gets a license that allows them to consistently draw more cards than the other players has a huge edge in this one, making balance an issue. But it's intriguing and engaging enough that I want to play more in hopes of discovering my fears about balance are wrong.

I did not back this on KS. Then the reviews came out and everyone was talking about all the dynamic choices and such that this game generates. I quickly got out there and found me a copy of it at CSI. Kind of let down by this one. It's much more of a basic card game than I had hoped. I had it in my head it was going to be along the lines of Glory to Rome or Mundus Novus with that much to it and well...it's just not that deep. 

UPDATE: A few more plays in and dropping the rating. In fact trading this one off as I'm never going to play it anymore. It's alright but just that. The auction I feel is just awful in this game. It's even worse than awful in a 2 player game. The minimum starting bids just take almost all the tension of the auction away. Almost every time you simply pick the card you want from what is available and pay the minimum bid.

I had watched the tail end of this game being played a while ago, but without knowing the rules it didn't make any sense.  After that I had heard someone go off on how some start situations were unbalanced and the game was virtually broken.  So when I finally got around to playing this I didn't really have many expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it is a pretty good game.

You start with a hand of cards and getting cards after that is pretty hard, drawing two keeping one each turn.  Cards can be used as currency, boats that can be launched, or captains to pilot your boats.  There is an auction every round for licenses which let you launch boats of a specific type.  Boats have a cost to launch.  So you have to manage your hand so that you have enough cards as coins to win your auction, but leave the right type of boat card so that you can launch a boat (and you'll need a card/s to pay for the launch) and another card to captain it.  After your start hand you'll need to get cards quickly to be able to do anything.   

Captained boats get a fish cube every turn (up to four) which are VP's.  Boats and licenses have associated VP's.  Licenses give you special abilities which are mostly ways to get cards or reduce costs. Having more licenses of a type increases that bonus. Some special licenses are flat out high VP cards that don't do anything else.

Overall it's a quick fun little game.

RATING: 5
[thing=121297][/thing], in its rules, is relatively simple. There are five phases in a round:

1st) Auction for fishing licenses;
2nd) Launch ships into the sea (you need to have licences for this) and hire captains;
3rd) Fishing;
4th) Process and trade fish;
5th) Draw new cards.

The cards the players have in hands have multiple functions: they are money (each is worth from 1 to 3 money); ships (each connected to a type of license); captains (put face down in a ship card, indicating that the ship is manned, thus it can fish).

The auction works like the one in [thing=2651][/thing] - the first player chooses a license to put to auction, and gives a bid (all licenses have a minimum amount to be purchased). The bids go clockwise until there is one that isn't surpassed. The winner pays the amount and is out of that auction phase. If it was the first player that won the auction, the next player will choose one license to put to auction; if it wasn't him, he will choose again one to be auctioned. All rounds there will be a number of licenses equal to the number of players, and isn't mandatory that everyone buy a license - is allowed to simply pass. The licenses that aren't bought, stay in the table, and in the next auction phase, new ones will be added until there are 1 per player. If not even one license is bought in a round, all the licenses are discarded at the end of the auction phase.

After comes the launch ships and hire captains phase. To launch a ship the player needs to have the proper license for the ship - I can't sent into the sea a Cod vessel if I only have license for Lobster. Also, the player must pay the cost to launch the ship (between 1 to 3, depending on the type) - this is also paid using the cards in hand. Hire a captain is simply take any card from hand and placing it face down together with a ship - the ship is, now, manned, and will be able to fish. Normally, players will be limited to launch 1 ship and hire 1 captain in this phase; but there are licenses that boost these numbers up to two.

Its worth mentioning that there isn't change in the game, so if something costs 1 and the player only has a 3 money card, he will have to pay the full 3. This is valid both for the auction and the launch of ships.

Following the launch and hiring, comes the fishing phase: all manned ships get 1 fish token. Each ship can have a maximum of 4 fish tokens on it - the excess is lost. Then players with a Processing license can trade fish for cards.

Finally, in the last phase, each player takes 2 cards from the draw deck, choose 1 and discard the other. Then a new round starts.

The game ends when all the fish tokens are used or when there isn't enough licenses to reach 1 per player. At the end, players will tally victory points from the licenses, from ships launched, plus 1 VP per fish token on the ships, and from bonus points (from the King-Crab licenses and the Fishermans Pub - both only count for the player that acquired them). The player with the most points, wins!

There are other details, specially those of timming to use some special abilities granted by licenses. And this is what is worth adding: all the licenses, not only allow the same type of ships to be launched, also grant addition effects, different for each type of license. For instance, the Shrimp license makes the cost of everything be lowered by 1. The Tuna one allows the player to keep more cards in the draw phase. The Lobster one give extra cards accordingly to the number of manned ships (don't need to be Lobster ships) the player has. The King-Crab, as mentioned, give bonus points. The Processing license allows exchanging fish for cards. And it goes on. Also, the more of the same license the player has, more powerful is the effect.

[thing=121297][/thing] is well put together, without many rough edges. I did found weird that the Processing ships also fish, as they aren't connect to an unique type of fish/crustacean. Not that is impossible for a Processing ship to fish, it is just, to me, like a fuel jet carrying bombs - possible, but just [i]seems wrong[/i]. The symbols on the licenses aren't the most intuitive ones, but there are text on them to help, and considering only the base game, the number of different effects is low (six, if I'm not mistaken), so it easy and fast to get used to them. The art is really nice and the components well done - but I do know that I played the Kickstarter edition, so the retail one can be less good.

Now, my biggest issue with [thing=121297][/thing] is how "solitaire" it is. Just and only in the auction phase the players are actually playing together. And even in here the interaction is... mild. I cited [thing=2651][/thing] to exemplify the type of auction (but is more for the selection of what to be auctioned), but in [thing=2651][/thing] there are lots of tension and intense dispute for the power plants. In [thing=121297][/thing], considering there is always 1 license per player to be sold, everyone can leave the auction phase with one, without needing to entering in a knife fight against someone else. All licenses are worth points. All give a good benefit. Sure, the more you have of one, the befit gets stronger, but having several different isn't bad at all, as you would be able to launch more types of ships and would gain different benefits for different things, which can be even better. There is basically no strong reason to brawl against someone else for most of them. So, our actions usually went like this:

Player 1: "I pay 5." (the minimum cost)
Player 2: "I pay 6."
Player 3: "Pass."
Player 1: *Ponders if is worth to rise the bid to 7. Calculates what he needs to launch a ship and hire a captain. Decides that isn't worth it.* "Pass."
Player 2: "Neat."

And that was about it. Licenses rarely went for more than 1 or 2 money above the minimum cost. This is mostly because money is so tight, and there is not enough room to wiggle. It is not even allowed for the same player to try to get more than 1 license per auction phase. So, if you are basically rich in a round, with 15 money or more, you will definitely take whatever license you want. Great. And I, with 6 or 7, will also be able to take a license. Maybe even [i]of the same type[/i] you took! A bigger dispute will mostly only happen for the special licenses - the King-Crab ones and for the Pub. However, even in here is not much of a fight, as you will see in, say, [thing=118][/thing]. Since money is tight, usually the one with enough at the time the license appears, will take the it. For instance, in ony play, a King-Crab appeared and was bought by a player that spend almost everything he had in hand. In the next round, this player hasn't recovered from the major spending, so he was out of the dispute when another King-Crab license came. So other player took it, easily - because he was the one with the money now. In the next round, the third and final King-Crab license showed up. If it was a 4 player game, there could be fight between the two that haven't bought one (not even the one that bought the first King-Crab license would probably accumulated enough to buy another), but since it wasn't, the third player was the one bought it.

The type of economy like the one in [thing=28143][/thing] (cards are money and also the product) creates a series of some tough decisions ("jezz, if I pay 7 I won't be able to launch a ship, pay for this, and also put a captain on it, and if I don't, I won't get the benefit of this license..."), but isn't really good and efficient to create [i]dynamic auctions[/i].

Then, after the auction phase, is everyone for themselves. You do your thing, I do mine, and we meet in the next bland auction phase, deal? Not that the solitaire thing is an evil in itself, as there are lots of players that like this aspect, as the fun for them is to lay plans and see them fructify, without external interference, and unexpected turns and events. These types of games are good for families, where the ideal is to end the game without hurt feelings. I get this. However, is undeniable that [thing=121297][/thing] lacks a lot in the emotion department.

So, to sum it up, [thing=121297][/thing] is a neat game, with relevant decisions to be made by the players, and is nice to see all the different effects taking place in your turn, like a well oiled machine (or fishing company). Also it has little downtime (most of the game can be happen with simultaneous turns), and allows for multiple ways to achieve victory (but I don't think one can win without at least one of the special licenses). However it lacks thrill. I know that someone might think I was expecting an thematic amerigame and got burned. Not really. I was expecting more, yes, theme. But is mostly like a Feld game - mechanics with some resemblance with the actual thing it deals with. However, it was the solitaire part that made it fail with me (though I would still play it, I wasn't offended by it, nor is a bad game - the mechanics are sound and good).

But there isn't storms raging in the high seas, no relentless chases for shoals, no race to get first to a coveted fishing spot, nor put faith in the in an old capitain, or in a grumpy but reliable sea wolf. No swift tides, or treacherous currents, or man at sea.

In the end is less like this:

Fleet has much more depth than the small box would lead you to think. Every time I've played it a new good engine has appeared. It's not quite as deep as Glory to Rome which uses the same mechanism, but it is almost as fun. Fancy a game about fishing in the arctic being fun... That said, I would definitely get some of the promos or the expansion to add more variety.

My game group is really smitten with this game. It has the meaningful choices of a fairly heavy game, but it has a fairly short play time. Use just the base set, and you can finish a game in 30 minutes. Add in expansion cards, and you dramatically add to the depth of the game. Fleet gives you the feeling of creating really varied and interesting engines, so the strategy is great. Add to that the multiple uses of the boat cards which act as money, boats, and captains. This card play adds critical tactical decisions as well.

I was able to play two games of Fleet last night and I was really surprised with how GREAT this game is!

The art is first-class. 
Quality, sky-high.
The theme is not only original, but fits with the mechanics in a way that make this game truly immersive. You really feel like you are building a fishing business and competing against others for limited resources. I don't think it could have been done any better.

The game if full of excellent decision points and the paths to victory are many. Players must build an economic engine as quickly an efficiently as possible and learn when to "flip the switch" from an economic machine to VP machine to secure a win, much like in Puerto Rico or Dominion.

We laughed and laughed during our games with all the opportunities for banter and it moves quickly. In fact, it's the perfect length. I never felt like I had to wait too long, or that the game was dragging. And all this in a small box that you can put in your glovebox.

I was really impressed by Fleet. It's an absolute must-own game. 

The only downside is that a runaway leader is very hard (impossible) to stop. I want to play with the Weather Authority license, which should help solve for this. But personally, I don't have any issue with it. It just means players should be of equal skill levels to get the most out of the game. You know, like is true for games like Chess. On the bright side, it can be hard to even tell who is up since VPs are counted at the end. My first game was settled by 2 points.

I do wish it could play more than 4.

RATING: 5
After playing this 5 times, all 2 player, I'm throwing in the towel.

1. The rules are poorly written.

For example, the following are unclear.  I had to visit BGG to realize the following

* no need for PV vessel to process or trade
* unlimited launching of a boat type once you have the license

Neither of these are clearly explained in the rules.  

2. It's lacking in theme.

No, it's not that this isn't Ameritrash.  The lack of theme is in the very bones of the mechanics.

For example, in the real world fish processing frequently takes place on huge factory ships, not on land.  The reason the rules were unclear is that this real world issue was ignored.  There's no need for a processing vessel to process, you just need the license.  But this isn't the only lack of theme.

As many fans of the game have noted, this is about the auctions.  It's not really about fishing at all.  The benefits the cards give you have no connection to those types of fish.  Having spent much of my childhood on the Maine coast I was expecting some sort of thematic connection within the mechanics.  It just isn't there.  The benefits of lobster and shrimp could be switched and it wouldn't affect the game one iota.  

3. There's a fly in the ointment.  At first I thought it was the overpowered processing vessel license when a player can go the entire game without one.  I played a game in which I purposely set it up for this to happen  (after having it happen twice and not being prepared) and found that the lack of PVL isn't the problem at all.  You can win without it.

The problem, as noted already by others, is a lack of a catch up mechanic.  You can know about half way through the game who's going to win.  I would say it's rare if you don't know three quarters of the way in, especially with 2 players.  Which brings me the crux of the problem.

4. The value of licenses is arbitrary and too fluid.  

The same period of time I played Fleet I played Container, a game with a current weight of 3.2 compared to Fleet's current weight of 2.4.  It should be clear that Container is the deeper game.  The games aren't similar, but they have a couple of commonalities.  Foremost, they both have auctions.  In Container you and know exactly what something is worth.  In Fleet it's very vague.  And that vagueness is what I believe leads to the runaway leader problem.  Over bid or don't bid enough, at arbitrary moments, and you can cripple your entire game.

In Container I can tell you exactly why I was able to win the game and exactly why the others lost: I didn't overbid and the others did.  I even know exactly when this occurred - and most importantly, I knew it when it was happening in the game!  In Fleet, I only know afterward.  THAT is the problem here.  What good is an auction when you don't immediately know if you've made the right choice or not?  It ends up being a crap shoot.

The reason this appears to happen, at least in 2p games, is because the value of a license is not inherent.  It's highly dependent on when it appears and how often.  

A shrimp license that appears once at the beginning is worth way more than one at the end of the game.  A shrimp license that appears once and never again early in the game is worth a lot, but if two show up at once right at the beginning are worth face value. In a 2p game if you bid up the card the other player just passes and then gets the 2nd card at face value.  Thus, both cards are face value.  This is just one example.  The entire game is full of fluid values that depend on when and how often a card shows up - information you don't know until the end of the game!  

It seems as if this becomes less of an issue with more players, but with 2 is a massive problem.  Highly luck dependent auctions are boring.  Period.

I have to rate Fleet based on what I've seen.  At 3 or 4 player perhaps this is a far better game.  Maybe it's a a 7.  I leave those ratings to those who have played it with more and seen the game's value.  I don't see it at 2p. For 2 that there are far better options. Too bad because I loved the theme.

All said and done, if I wanted to play an economic card game for two I'd choose Jambo with expansions over this every single time.

I am attracted to the idea that you need to complete the separate steps of get a License, Launch a boat, and then Hire a Captain before you can be prodcutive and catch Fish (which are Points).

But I remain uncomfortable about all the special rules that accompany each of the Licenses.  Once the first round or two has passed it means that:  1) everybody is now playing against a whole different set of rules compared to all other players: and 2) it's just plain a messy jumble every round tracking what rewards and exceptions each player qualifies for at the different phases. Spaghetti Rules.

Initial impression was a little underwhelming.  I like games where cards have multiple uses, I like the bidding aspect, adding fish each round felt a bit tedious, overall there just weren't many interesting decisions to make.  It's mostly a game of deciding if you should save up a turn or go for auction.

Initial rating is so-so, hope to give it more plays and with the expansion to see if that adds meat to it and not just variability.

The first time we played the game, we cleared out and refreshed all the charters each turn.  THAT IS INCORRECT.  And (surprise!) when you play it the way the rules tell you to, it is a much better game.  Different strategies are viable (the player who diversified won the game over the player who stuck with two licenses, but only by one point), but the engine development part of the game is pretty clever.  I'd definitely play it again.

It might be because I am already well-versed in card games like Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, Dominion and Glory To Rome but for whatever reason, Fleet just doesn't grab me like those other games do. I say this despite the fact that it uses a design paradigm I love, that of using cards for multiple purposes. (As most of those previously mentioned titles do as well.) It might just be the smallish card pool, as there are only a couple of different special abilities on the contracts and the differences between the various boats you can buy are somewhat negligible. I guess the game is in the contract auction, but I have so many terrific auction games that this one just didn't make a splash in my game group.

Maybe the widespread appeal is just that an interesting auction mechanism is happening in a quick filler card game...but I can get that in High Society, so this one is going on the trade/sell pile.

On one hand, cards as currency games may seem to struggle a little to explain just how that mechanic works thematically (in RftG, cards are actually always resources, as well as opportunities/info etc.), however they always seem to balance things out with their overall theme. I'm no mad-keen fisherperson but I like that this neat card game is about fishing boats and licenses as well as utilising cards as currency. Keen to run it.

Great auction and tableau building game hindered only by rules that do not answer obvious questions. Download a play-aid from BGG.

Okay game, but the flow felt a bit illogical. Shrimp boats catch shrimp, so Processing Ships catch ... processors? Adn your goal is not to sell as much fish as you can, but to have boats filled to brim still out at sea? Expected a more traditional gather-process-sell resource flow. Game has a nice theme and some good ideas, but felt unfinished.

Great medium-weight card game (auction and placement euro-style point generation) with exceptional quality cards.

It only seems to grow on me. Looking forward to the next time I can get this to the table.

A short, sneaky-deep game. Cards have multiple uses so you need to manage your hand well. Has a good amount of variety with some of the promos and the random setup. Plays very quickly with two so far, three adding an unnoticeable amount of time. A good looking filler.

Slightly better with 3 so far, but I think auction games are generally a bit lonely with 2.

Auction-Game that escalates very quickly.
At the beginning you have only few boats, money, and captains represented by multi use-cards and can do very little. But as you get more and more licenses and put more and more boats out, you get more special powers and make more money every round, so you have a lot more possibilities.
This game is easy to learn and to play and it also plays very quick, which is really cool. A very nice filler game.

6.5 after 1 play.

The license seems a little strange. Somehow, the replayability does not seem very high.

Base game alone is a 7.  Arctic Bounty plus the 2-player variant pushes it to an 8.

Rating based on one demo play at origins.

Takes the san juan engine up a notch by upgrading your abilities.  Very slick and addictive gameplay, need to play a lot more to dig in deeper to its strategies. 

Definitely my type of game, glad I got a chance to play.  Purchased same day.

the theme does not fit the game well. The promo cards should be put into the standard game.

Tableau building card game with a great theme and lovely art.
Buy licences for specific boats, launch boats and captain them to collect fish. Boat-cards have different effects on gameplay leading to very interesting and varying gameplay.
Expansion highly recommended

Meh, was hoping this one was going to be a bit deeper but it turns out it's an inch deep and a mile wide. Not recommended for deep strategic type thinkers. More of a theme game and I simply don't care too much about theme. I want games that are challenging and fun....not thematic and boring.

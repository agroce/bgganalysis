RATING: 3.3
This game has the weird quality of Candyland-style determined outcome mixed with highly-limited decision-making that leaves one feeling they could have done more when really it was just  an illusion. Worth another play just to confirm that I didn't miss something and that someone really did market this as an actual game.

Fun little game.  Played it 4 times in succession and my mate's girlfriend won 3 of them.  She is just such a kick-arse bargain hunter that she's awesome at this game, just using her own retail skills!

151115-need to retry it with the ravensberger changes
[q]For #2 - I strongly prefer / will only play the Ravensburger edition, which (1) allows players to call, and not just raise, and (2) contains properties 1-20 and checks 0,0,3-20. One caveat: I do not know for certain what the IELLO version contains, but I believe from a picture I saw that it matches the Gryphon components.[/q]

130929 I really dislike the blind bidding aspect of this game.  It has completely been replaced in my book by No Thanks.  The only reason its not a 2 is because its short enough I'd consider replaying it.

120707 Fun quick tense game.  Not much else to say about it...I like auctions so it falls in my zone.  But I like No Thanks/Geshenkt way more.

An excellent, simple card-game with a basic auction phase, which for many light card-games would constitute the entire affair, followed by a second phase where you use what you have bought as currency in a blind bidding system. Clever, light, great amusing graphics, and lots of fun for three players or more. Quick to play too!

RATING: 6
7 plays / 4,5,6 players

LIKE: Quick, easy to learn. It's fun to push-your-luck when auctioning, since the last player must pay full.

DISLIKE: The little coins only come in one denomination, so it's hard to count out 21 coins. The bidding can be predictable at times. Some player order binding when auctioning.

OVERALL: A classic filler, but very light.

For a fast card game, there's nothing better in my collection (well, except maybe No Thanks!). It's great too because my girls can play it. And we all love the art on the cards. It's rock solid and fits the niche of fast to teach, fast to play, instant set up time. Every collection should have this one.

Chaotic but great fun for 15 mins

2016-05-13
For Sale is a bidding game that is very easy to approach. Rather simple and quick to teach but still offering tough decisions. The game is quite chaotic but mostly skill based since you can try to outguess your opponents.

Lacks the depth required for higher ratings, though. Nevertheless, there is plenty to ponder for a 15 minute filler so there is no way you can call the game shallow. However, after some time your plays start to follow certain patterns and it takes really outrageous opponents to thwart you. Thus I am a bit concerned that the optimal play is a bit too hard coded into the game and the number of different situations the game throws at you is limited.

I would not be too concerned though. If enjoyed responsibly For Sale offers years of fun.

Wow!  Great little game that causes much amusement and laughter. It's great how the differences in property values in the first half of the game, and cheques in the second half of the game can cause you palpitations and influence your decisions about what to bid.  There's a fair amount of bluffing in it, too, and there's nothing better than selling a cardboard box to the bank for several thousand dollars.  

You've got poker-like bidding in the first half of the game and blind bidding in the second half - lovely!  And it's so elegant and pretty to look at that you're just dying to get the game out when sessions allow.

If only buying and selling real estate were this much fun in real life. For Sale is a great game with two auction rounds.

+ Extremely fast play; Everyone understands the concept of buying low and selling high, so teaching this game is usually a snap.
- Game gets very "same-y" after several plays.

It was never getting played anymore since acquiring other filler games, so I traded it away with Ascension for London.

Fun filler, scales well to 6 players, easy to get & play.  Not very deep and very limited ability to pursue a strategy (almost no ability).

I enjoyed this game a lot, it is a simple and efficient filler. The key here is that the auction forces the first player to make a good bid every round and this is almost impossible to handle all the auction taking the best properties, so you have to be optimous with your money, sometimes it implies on taking bad properties. But this doesn't signify that you are going to make bad money of it, if you play it well you can make your small properties worth a lot of money and if you play bad in the second part of the game, you can make big properties don't pay to well. Interesting game, easy mechanics and fast playtime.

Simple trick taking game for me. Has minimal strategic depth, as most options are plain to see in all 3 levels of play. A 'get-A-to-get-B-to-get-C' game. Nice initially, but gets bored after a few plays. Even party gamers don't want to play it again after the first shot.

Like the simple idea, but low replay value. No brain teaser, just flip the cards game.

3-6(5)

Quick, easy to understand, and reasonably fun. There's a psychological element, but also just a lot of guesswork.

The first phase has an element of chicken to it as well as rationing and relative evaluation. Getting a 30 is nice, but less so if everybody else got something in the 20s. Getting a 15 is nice if all the other lots are really low-valued, but you're still left with only a 15, certainly not a guaranteed winning lot.

The second phase then is where the odd guesswork comes in. Sometimes you're convinced that top properties will come out and you play big, but turns out everybody else chose that round of checks to dump their junk. And vice versa.

Interesting, but moreso from a "how things play out" perspective than from a strategic angle.

There are a lot of decisions to make, but ultimately it feels like they could just go either way (on certain lots, say 28 / 25 / 21 / 5 / 2, people might play aggressively or just dump lowbies), and justifiably. Also, gamers might view this one as a "gateway", but games like this and Ticket to Ride, to "rookies", qualify as the real deal, and that's meaningful.

Excellent quick auction game IMO.  Quick game play and tense moments during the second phase while everyone reveals their cards makes this one a great filler or lunch game with three or more.

Played just a few times. Perhaps there is more to discover, but I just don't get what the hype is about.
However, it is a good game to play at family gatherings.
-you can play with many people.
-can be taught and played quickly.
-can be played by kids as well as adults.

Fun game to play with muggles, although the strength of this game lies in your ability to outwit your opponents and other games are a better vessel for that sort of interaction.  But for the price and size this game should be in everyone's collection as an easy filler.

The perfect game for non-gamers and gamers alike.  People who have no idea what they're doing usually win.  Plays quick and though it works best with four, I've found three to be just as interesting and cutthroat if everyone knows how to play.

RATING: 7.5
Quick and fun game that is more about reading your opponents and adapting your game plan constantly to keep up with the game. Although this is a random card draw game it is really an auction game focused on bidding wars with limited resources. Bid to high early and you will be broke for the later rounds. Bid to low and you are left with worthless properties for round two. There is no guarantee that skill and reading people will win you the game but it will get you a very good chance.

THE BEST filler game in existence! This game's got a lot going for it. First of all, it's extremely easy to teach. The game is two different games in one; a bidding game and a psychological, outguess your oponents game. I love this game!

After quite a bit of research I decided (in theory) that I liked the original For Sale rules and card distribution better.

For Sale ‐ Ravensburger edition (3-5p) (1997)

Since getting and playing it I have not been disappointed. Love the 'call' option. With fewer properties than the updated version the 'call' option doesn't drag this quick filler out too long. The bidding wars the call option can  create can be very interesting.

I'd be interested to try the updated version to compare the two.

A great quick filler game for the family.  Has very simple rules which can be taught while played as the auction and psuedo-trick taking elements of it are easily understood.  Has great components which can be brought along anywhere (as long as you replace the game box with some other form of storage) and is immediately playable taking under a minute for set up.  Best with more players and always plays around the 20 minute mark, if not shorter!

(Side Note) I received some marked cards with my copy, but was quickly sent replacements once I contacted FRED.  Thanks!

The King of all fillers.  So simple, yet so brilliant... and you always want to play it again, right away.  Okay, well I do.

[rating for Uberplay version: 8.  I miss the match-a-bid rule and the greater variance in the check cards.  The system is still a winner, but the streamlining - they streamlined For Sale, fer Chrissakes! - may speed up gameplay (as if the game needed to be faster), but it's also more forgiving now, and thus, for me, not as satisfying.]

Got this game last year and played with my group a couple times.  Most in the group seemed to like it more than me, but I wasn't sure why.  And then I broke this out with my non-gaming family this past week and it hit me.  This game works because it's simple.  But, that's not a bad thing.  I think my problem was I wasn't seeing the forest for the trees.  I wanted it to be more than it needed to be.  The core basics of buying low and selling high, it was fun to see people work that out and determine if it was worth it to press their luck and become the high bidder.  Was on my trade list, but now it's back into my keep collection.  Huzzah.

RATING: 9
An excellent game. It is very short (15 minutes) but that makes it more comfortable for more people. You can play through a couple of rounds and have a lot of fun! There is strategy, but not enough to regret moves and to sit there and concentrate. I would say that 95% of people who play this game would like it.

A good filler game that plays quick and is easy to teach.  You can usually explain the game while shuffling the cards and dealing the initial money to the players.  As a filler / closer, this is a top rate title; however, repeated plays in a row diminish the beauty in the game.  [GTI Code: AGCL]

Initial rating based on playing once. Might go up or down a lot after futher plays. I like the two distinct phases of the game, using your output from the first phase as input for the second phase, but fear there's not enough chance for second guessing and making agonizing decisions in that second phase. Since money is very limited and bidding goes swiftly, I suspect that your neighbours' bidding habits have a too significant impact on your fortunes.

RATING: 7
A wonderfully designed simple/filler auction game that is divided in two phases. In the 1st phase, property-cards are auctioned off and later used to buy contract/money cards in the 2nd phase. But what really sets this game apart is that players must consider the actions of other players; often, you want to bid the perfect amount so that you end up in 2nd-place, which guarantees you the 2nd-highest property for only 1/2 your bid. Furthermore, by tracking what cards have been purchased/played, you can make more meaningful decisions in the 2nd-phase (blind-bidding auction).

This game is short, fun, and very intuitive. It's going to remain in my collection for some time.

Update: 9-6-07
This game has been going up and down in my rating.  I think this will now settle at 8 as I think it belongs in my collection.  It is a great filler that involves auction and out-guessing my opponents.  The fact that it is so fast is very nice.  Also its small size, makes it very portable and useful for trips.  However, the fact still remains most of the time after I play this game I feel blah.  Maybe just too light for my tastes but I am not saying it's a bad game at all.  I should still have a copy though since it also makes as an introductory game for non-gamers.

This is simply the definitive filler. It is quick (easily playable in 15 minutes!), it has simple rules, it is replayable, and higlhy addictive. I am fascinated from the "double game" mechanic, and from the necessity to try to exploit turn order to make deals and force other player into bad buys. While I won't ever be any good at such kind of game, I fell in love during my very first game!

RATING: 7
Pretty refreshing game. It has been a while since we last played this and we pretty much forgotten the rules. Was introduce to this first by a friend, then bought a copy of my own this year from Hong Kong.

I feel that the format for the 3-4 players and the 5-6 players is quite different. For the 3-4 players setup, you have to remove 6 properties cards and 6 cheques, which gives more uncertainty since you are not aware if there is going to be a level 30 property or 2 cheques of 15,000 each.

Still it is enjoyable as a 5-6 players game, just that the game will be slightly more predictable.

Fun bidding game. I think it has limited replayability , however, as once you get the main mechanic and memorize the cards there isn't a whole lot more to the game. Fortunately, this isn't much of a problem as the game takes about 20 minutes to play so it's a satisfying filler for the right group.

A good auction filler/gateway game that is easy to explain and play in a short amount of time.

I can't see myself playing more than 2 games of this back to back, but it is pleasant enough to play once in a while and definitely one of the better filler type games.

Not my favorite game, but it is very easy to teach new players.

FAVORITE FILLER CARD GAME

3-6 Players (Best: 5) / 20 Min / Weight: 1.29
Type: Family

Owning old version with 20 real estate cards. Want a new version, possibly upcoming IELLO version.

+ Simple rules. Easy to teach and learn.
+ Small package. Small foot print. Quick play.
+ Scales pretty well. It's better with more players, but 3p is still pretty good.
+ Not very deep, but still requires meaningful decision making every turn.

My rating reflects that this game is a light weight filler, not that it isn't a good game.  Clearly it is a great gateway game, real estate is an easy concept for new players and games are quick and fun.  I introduced Basari and For sale to two new players and they both liked basari better since there were more tactical choices.  That being said, at the end of the night there always seems time for this game unlike most others on my shelf.

Quick, fun and easy to learn.  A nice two step bidding/auction game that has you first trying to acquire property for cheap, then selling it on the open market for a profit.  

I prefer this over High Society, a game it is often compared to as a filler.

Great filler auction game that is enhanced by having a mix of two different bidding systems.  The first has a push your luck, trying to come in second element which works well but can leave you a little screwed depending on what other players do or how the cards fall out.  Never hit the "love", like say High Society does but will be happy, if in no rush to play this again.

UPDATE: Sold it. Not my kind of game.

OLD: I don't have a lot of love for this game. It just feels plain. I picked it up because it's supposed to be a great game for your average dinner guests. That part is true. It is very easy to teach and the group enjoyed it enough to play about three times, but I was bored with it after the first game. I can hide my boredom pretty easily behind my joy of seeing my non-gamer friends have so much fun actually playing one of my silly games, but this is not something I would bring to game night with a more experienced group. Not even as filler. It may just be the theme or maybe I just don't find auction centered gameplay all that fun.

Use to be the best filler ever. But then I discovered No Thanks! This one needs to be repackaged. The box is way to big for what it is.

RATING: 10
My first "10" rating due to the following: short playing time, easy to teach, has enough tension, and allows for a degree of strategy and bluff. I also like the fact that the tide of the game drives even those that may not know what they're doing toward the finish, keeping everyone engaged.
*Starting to burn out on this, but still a solid choice.
*Will definitely not fall below '10' due to the "ten-minute play time" tag line that can work on even the most tired non-gamer and the near universal praise from them afterwards.
*64th play: A bit worn on me, but still a '10' for accessibility, play-time, and ability to play "mindless" or "engaged."

This game seems to get a little better every time I play it.  At first I was less than impressed, but now I think there's really a great game in there.  The game is amazingly fast, but it seems to be loaded with difficult decisions.  Players will be challenged to decide when it is advantageous to throw in a lot of cash, and when it makes more sense to bow out.

Then in the second round it becomes a game of reading your opponents and deciding when the best moment is to slip in those cheap houses.  It seems that every game I've played of For Sale has been close and comes down to a matter of a few points.  This kind of tension in a fast filler game is priceless.  Although I wasn't able to see it after my first game, now I'm sure that this game is a real gem.

Lightning quick filler that can be explained in three minutes, and packs a tun of fun into 15-20.  There are multiple strategic paths to the bidding, and the selling of properties ads a "Can I out think the rest of you" component that everyone will invariably screw up at some point.  It all combines for a lot of fun - the best filler game I own.

After more plays, completely convinced of this games' value to casual and hardcore players alike.  No matter who I'm playing with (even first-timers), everybody gets excited when For Sale hits the table.  THIS is the gateway game you have been looking for!

Awesome filler game.  It's an almost guaranteed hit with non-gamers -- nearly every time I've brought it out, a second (or third or fourth) playing has been demanded.  You can blow through a game in fifteen minutes INCLUDING teaching the rules.  Half of the game is a simple auction with a clever twist; the other half is multiplayer rock-paper-scissors.

Unfortunately, this game will NOT work with some gamers.  I introduced it to my heavier gaming buddies and their reaction was, "Um...was that it?"

My favorite fillers.  Very quick game, how can you not want to play this all the time?  As I read in another comment, I think the appeal for myself and those I play it with is the trick-taking aspect of the game.  Working the hand you created to gain the most $$ is the challenge.

Some consider it the King of Fillers. It just might be. Easy to learn and teach, appeals to gamers and non-gamers alike. I've played dozens of times with dozens of different groups and For Sale is always a hit. 
Also, I've only lost once, which might be why I like it so much.

For a bidding game, I was quite surprised to find that I didn't mind this one. I rate it about like High Society, but I probably like it a little better. Not only is it mercifully short and sweet, it also has an element of abstractness that seemed to help me - If you didn't do great in the first phase, you have a chance to recover a bit in the resell phase.

None of our regular gaming friends have this, so I kept picking this up and putting it back down for over a year in the store. However, I just received it as a gift from my 2007 BGG Secret Santa. Yay! It does make a great little filler game, and we are a little short of those (and I'm getting tired of 6 Nimmt! for the time being). And I just noticed that it's also a 6-player game, which makes it even more of a score, since we've had occasion to want a couple more of those.

RATING: 7.25
This is brilliant. It's a filler alright, but a great one. The double blind auction concept is superb. First off, you bid for houses with your cash. That's fair enough. Lots of scope to screw your neighbour are built in to this as when you drop out, you pay half your bid and take the lowest valued house (1-30). Winner has to pay full price. Then if that wasn't enough, you bid for cheques ($1,000 to $15,000) with your houses!

This is a really fast game, takes 15 minutes to explain, set up, play, put away again. So you just have to play it twice.

RATING: 7.5
This game is fun.  I like the tension created by the first round betting, as you either risk paying full price, or pay half for a lesser card.  Once one drops out, the rest follow suit, leaving someone holding the bag.  And the bluffing and second-guessing of the second round make for a nice change of pace.  And it's super quick.

Blind auctions are not my favorite, but this is such a classic with hilarious artwork and simple mechanics that plays 6 players well.  I usually pull this one out as a teaser to non-gamers to try something else of mine.

Played it two times with a party of six. With that many players turn order becomes so important. That, combined with not knowing which sets of buildings turn up the next round make it hard to control. It's as unpredictable as a volatile stock market. How much do you invest? Can you skip the next round, or should you save some money?

What saves this game are the bouts of extreme luck and fortune that can happen and the frustration and hilarity that ensues among players. And it plays quick. Okay to play as a conclusion of a game night I guess, but that's about it.

Can be played either of two ways.  As a light filler where you just try to get the best buildings and leverage a couple into good payouts.  Or more seriously by remembering who bought what when they are likely to play it.  I don't do that.  I prefer to play it as a light, but enjoyable game.  But there is more strategy than initially meets the eye.

12.12.10  I've played this enough now that I can say it's a solid 7 for me.  I like it, but the one part that I don't care for as much is that the first-round auctions aren't granular enough, due to only having $14 to bid.  I know that's part of the design.  It also seems VERY dependent on seating order; how far you are from the person who starts the bid can determine your destiny more than I'd like.  However, it is short, fun, and you can do more than you think with a lousy hand of cards.  A good filler, but not the Holy Grail of fillers some think it is.

Un buen filler de subastas. No es de mis mecánicas favoritas pero en este juego está bien integrada. Además es muy rápido. Me encanta que tenga los dos tipos de subastas (pública y ciega) aunque debo reconocer que no soy muy bueno en este juego.

5/20/06 - if you can count cards you'll do well at this game - if winning is the priority. You can have an equally fun time just playing it haphazardly just to see what happens though. Game plays very quickly and can be enjoyed by anyone.

RATING: 5.5
Play order trumps good play. The first phase the game plays you more than you play it, which sets up your position in the second phase, which is the more interesting portion. But again, your position in the second phase is determined by how you do in the first. Yes, it's filler but that does not excuse it. Plenty of filler games out there where the decisions are interesting and matter. Will play those instead.

Good low-complexity fun with a fast playtime. Like most auction games, you end up changing your style based on the behavior of your opponents.

This is an incredibly quick, easy to play game that is fun for...I think anyone.  Whether a quick filler or round after round (after round...after round) this game has tension, strategy, and great replay value.  It remains fun to play long after it should.

RATING: 5
It's exactly what it presents itself to be, a light, fluffy auction filler for variable numbers of players. There's not enough to the game to make me want to play more than a couple of times, and there's enough lacking to make me glad to get to the main event when this is done.

High Society was disliked by my gaming group, so we didn't expect much from For Sale. But its quicker speed, its simpler decisions, and its step-case turns made this a hit.

UPDATE: I've cooled to this a little bit. Not sure why. I think, as with any auction games, player enthusiasm makes a big, big difference.

A tremendous wee game which plays in no time but crams a helluva lot in.  The trick is to get your bids just right each time; which is of course impossible but you're bound to have fun trying and the game is over so quickly there is always the temptation to have another go immediately.

The above comment is ancient, and while we *used* to be able to play For Sale quickly, like some other Dorra games some gamers will definitely over-think this one, which can lead to extra, undesireable length. Also, the new version supports 6 players, which is nice, but it does make what wants to be a short game longer.

I do like For Sale a lot, but with some players it will turn from a nice filler to a 30-45 minute game which feels too long. I still think it's an excellent game, but you've been warned.

Just got the Gryphon version of the game from Tommy and Wendell today (for my birthday).  Super excited to play it.  (2/5/10)

Played during lunch with Tommy and Wendell.  We played that you pay the rounded down amount for a passed bid.  It was a fun game and I gave it a reasonably solid 7.  A game that I know will go up in ranking as we get more comfortable as to how much things are worth.  Like Ra.  (3/12/10)

7 years later and another play tells me that I want to increase my rating to 7.5  (4/6/17)

RATING: 6
Not a terrible game, I just never really get into it. I never feel strongly invested while playing. Maybe it's because of the different rules in the two rounds, who knows, I just don't find I care enough, like I'm just mechanically trying to do some rough calculations of value for the lowest card as opposed to the highest and making a decision. And it's not that I can't get invested in an auction game, I absolutely love Medici, it's just this one that I don't.

Probably the most fun and tense decisions in the shortest amount of time possible. The fact that you cannot generate more money ever at all makes every single bid feel exciting.

The dual auction system is fun, and always impresses new players. The second guessing and double bluffing that can happen in the second round is a joy to behold.

RATING: N/A
One of my absolute favorite filler games. It has simple rules that create tough choices. The bidding is tense, and the blind bidding in the second round even more so. I enjoy having two rounds that use different mechanics (first round as open auctioning, and the second as bluffing/blind auction). Can be a bit luck-based, as being in a certain spot in turn order can get you more valuable properties, or screw you in the bidding. For a 20-minute, large group (5-6 player) filler, this takes the cake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very well done light game.  The cards are of high quality and the price is right.  Even so, there is a decent amount of strategy involved to do well.  I enjoy the player interaction and speed of the game.  There aren't too many difficult decisions to make, but there are some.  Perfect filler game and supports a wide range of players.  With a great price, nice component quality, ease of learning, and player compatibility, I have nothing negative to say about this game for what it is.

RATING: 8
This is a favorite filler of many, and I do see why as the game play is quick, easy to teach but still offers some “tough” decisions. I like the first portion of the game more than the second as you need more skill and must evaluate all the cards out there; in the second half of the game, you kind of make blind bids which is a feature I'm not very fond of. But I guess it can lead to a lot of laughter which is great for a filler game (like the one time my brother used his 28 and got a 3 - d'oh!)

I sold my copy as I am not really a big fan of filler games and I think there are better short filler games (like, uhm, No Thanks, High Society, Guillotine and others). If I could get my hands on the tiny version, I would probably purchase it again. EDIT: which I have donw now. The tiny version is superior if you're in need of shelf space like me! I've played it 10+ times more since I acquired that, and I must say that I've grown more and more fond of For Sale. It's definitely one of the best fillers out there (though I still slightly prefer No Thanks and Ave Caesar).

Best Filler Ever---I play it regularly and always enjoy it. I feel it has  superior fun value over High Society which has less luck and is much tighter. Both are great, but I prefer For Sale because it's an easier pick-up for newbies and it's what I need from a filler---FUN!

UPDATE 01/09
Not hitting the table. Had to lower my score from a perfect 10. When it does get played, we enjoy it. But people rarely ask for it again. Maybe it isn't the best filler ever? But it's clearly brilliant.

This is really two games, a first phase which is an 8, and then a second phase which is more like a 6.

For Sale is an excellent, "workhorse" filler auction game that handle a range of audiences. I like auctions to begin with, and For Sales offers a two-stage auction: players first bid around the table, with people choosing houses as they drop out, and then blind bid their hand of houses, selling them for a range of prices. In essences, players and buying houses and then trying to flip 'em for a profit.

Regarding theme, you gotta love the sense of humor, with residences ranging from a cardboard box and a latrine all the way up to sky scapers and a space station.

New players will stumble through the first hand, but then once the light bulb goes on, the game is fast and fluid. I've been able to teach this game to non-gamers, but it's got just enough meat for gamers as well. After 20+ plays, it's easy to consider For Sale a good filler-weight game with staying power in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very quick playing auction game where in the first round you use your $18,000 to buy houses. Buyer pays full price while the others play half of their bid rounded up so you can get a house for free. Once all the houses are distributed you sell your houses for checks. Highest numbered house gets the highest check and so on. Add up the checks you've won and highest total wins the game. So short and so simple and really reminds me of Biblios in terms of filler auction games. The only difference is Biblios plays 2 well, while this needs at least 4 in my mind, but is still a lot of fun when you have more people.

Very fun, quick, easy-to-explain filler.  The pictures on the cards are incredibly cute!  =D  I think this game is currently my favorite filler, and I've enjoyed it much more than other auction or bidding games I've played since first playing For Sale.  I've also introduced it to some *very* non-gamery people who enjoyed it.  I prefer this game with 5-6, though 4 isn't too bad either.

Love this one because it's super easy to teach, super easy to get non-gamers into and is just downright fun.

Still fun though.

Delightful lightweight bidding game.  Very fast, with no pretensions.  Take the same mechanic and extend it to a 60 minute game and it would be terrible, but at about 15 minutes, it's fantastic.  Everybody I've ever introduced to this game -- from age 5 to age 75 -- has loved it.  (Well, except for the one table of people who had the experience ruined by a woman who spent 15 minutes during the very first bid complaining about how she liked the artwork on the second-highest card better than the highest card, so she wanted that one instead, and ended up bidding *all* of her money on that very first bid.  And then promptly quit the game, dragging most of the other players away with her, having succeeded in convincing them that this game was awful.)

My go-to auction filler.  You can teach the game in 2 minutes and play a game in about 10 minutes.
First phase is the auction phase where you bid for properties that all have a number value 1-30.
Second phase has cards with dollar values.  Every player secretly plays one of the properties they bought, then you compare values.  Highest numbered property takes home the most money.  Repeat until every has played all of their properties.

I really like this game.  It is simple, fast and versatile for many game situations - with gamers and non-gamers.  And there is definitely more than meets this eye with this one.  A few plays reveal better ways to bid; and you'll find yourself calculating how far you can press your money...or should you just take the lowest card now for free.  Albeit, it remains simple, but it is not mindless.

RATING: 5
A fun filler.. but only at the right player count.  There seems to be a sweet spot around 4 players.  With more than that, the auctions become boring for some at the table (as they will not get to bid), with fewer than that, the auctions are not cut throat enough for my liking.  I can just wait until the next lowest card comes along and snag it cheaply.

I'm not sure yet, but this might be better than High Society by a nose, in a very similar niche for a game.  Its a short auction filler.  For High Society a lot of the tension comes from the variable ending and the need to NOT be the person with the least money left.  In For Sale, the tension comes from not wanting to be the first one to flinch during the bidding.  There is a lot more psychology to the bidding in For Sale, to me.  High Society is more analytical, For Sale more of a 'press-your-luck' gambling feel.  Then, after you've done a great job with getting good deals on properties, you may still squander it all as you sell them to the bank if you don't 'play your cards right'.

RATING: 6
A fine auction game filler that compares favourably to High Society but plays even faster. The game runs in two rounds, one is an English bidding round to acquire property the second is a blind offering round to resell it, hopefully at a profit. The auction is less interesting to me than the one in High Society because of the lack of a hook, but the fact that this plays out in 10 minutes flat (whereas HS is more like 15) makes it very fun and replayable. 

The blind round is not as luck-based as some people would say. Even if you don't know what other people are going to bid specifically, you can sometimes win this game just by being cagey with your use of the cards and reacting to the spread of the checks that are available. Always look for groupings where the variation between high and low is not that big and then drop your crap off. Watch and see what cards are being used and try to squeak out extra money that way. I'm not arguing this is Go or anything approaching that, but the blind rounds are done just about perfectly here for my tastes.

A good filler, but I'm definitely starting to burn out on it. It is frequently compared to High Society, and I personally prefer the Knizia game because I think its two types of auction (standard and the agonizing reverse) are each more interesting than either of the round types here. HS is not any more skill-based than FS on the balance though, because the winner is heavily dependent on when the game ends, and players can only make educated guesses about when that is going to happen. FS is definitely the more accessible of the two.

As far as pure auction games goes, this is one of the better ones if only because it strips the genre down to a minimialist level and doesn't try to couch the mechanic in another system or in an unrelated, nonsense theme.  It's simple, quick, and easy to throw out and play with up to 6 which is good news to me.  I don't think it deserves quite the status it seems to have, but there definitely is a good game worth playing.

One of the greatest gateway/filler/family games ever. This has been my go-to game to introduce friends and family to the immense possibilities of tabletop land. Almost everyone we play this game with ends up loving it. 

I'm a big fan of auction games. I love this auction. I also love that you can "lose" in the auction (not get the best or highest valued cards) and still win out in the second phase of the game. It's all about reading others and good timing. Granted that backfires A LOT but the game is so quick and light that you can always play another round.

I don't know why I don't like this game that much.  I don't really see the challenge in it.  I played a lot as I took it on vactation this summer, and never really saw the challenge... I don't know, possibly with some other players it might work out.  Mainly played it with 3 players.

Played this again.  And it isn't that bad.  As a quick filler it is okay.

Nice filler that actually has a good bit of strategy to it. The game consists of two rounds. The first round you are using your starting money to purchase homes. Ideally you want to acquire the highest numbered homes. During the second round you are using the homes to sell for money, and obviously you want the highest valued money for each sale. A game takes less than 15 minutes - definitely worth your time.

This one lives up to its reputation as a good filler, especially for non-gamers.

RATING: 7
For Sale really is an almost ideal filler game, with a focused, streamlined design that is easy to teach and learn, and that offers just enough chaos to give a new player a shot at winning and enough decisions to satisfy a veteran. That is, as long as it's played in the proper mindset - casually and quickly, with the game length never topping 20 minutes or so and the outcome never taken too seriously. Beyond that, and the lightness of the design and the inherent randomness of the blind bid second half begins to overstay their welcome.

If I did have a complaint, it would be that money actually feels just a little too tight in the first half of the game, and so the bidding never really opens up as much as it seems to want to. This makes player order a pretty big factor in how the first half plays out, which is not my favorite mechanic for a filler game.

Components: The Überplay edition has nice money chips and checks, but the real estate images are the real winner, with a wonderful illustration for each of the 30 cards. The box is terribly oversized.

Experience: Fast and mildly fun mixture of auction and blind bidding. Having a few cards removed (with fewer players) helps to keep the last few offerings in doubt. Still, I haven't found anyone who really likes this game.

Perfect game as both filler for serious gamers, as well as nighttime game for  casual gamers.

Essayez d'être un poil irascible (oui, j'ai eu de mauvaises expériences avec les agences immobilières) et vous toucherez le pactole. For Sale est un jeu en 2 phases : une phase d'enchère pour acheter des maisons (de la niche au château de princesse), puis revendez les dans la seconde phase. Prêt ? Vendez !

RATING: 6.92746
The biggest merit to the game is it's short length - ideal as a filler, appetiser or a goodbye-game.

Ultimately a game of evaluating how much a property or money card is worth to you (and others), the two phases are almost two distinct games - sharing no rules - but both revolve around auctions and also thematically back each other to simulate the wheeling and dealing of a property tycoon.

In the first half of the game, going out last seemed nearly always a terrible option - usually, 3rd (out of 5) seemed the optimal place to be, depending on the bid. (winner pays in full, loser pays nothing, others pay half (rounded down)) As soon as the 3rd bidder drops out, though, the next will follow (to avoid being the auction winner) so it seemed as much about predicting others' moves as it was about deciding the value of a card.

In the 2nd phase, I started with a 9, hoping to win 3rd place (managing to do so) and again the game became about predicting how much others would value the cards - thus what they would place down - and playing something in the middle.

No single auction felt game-changing and given the lack of any 'big' choices (just a bunch of smaller ones), it sped along at a good rate. Simultaneously, though, there was clearly some strategy to be employed.

Given the brevity, I'd definitely like another game of this soon-ish.

Quite possibly the ultimate filler game.  Plays fast, can be taught in a matter of minutes and supports up to six players.  First you play cards to bid on houses, then you play houses to earn money.  Some fun group think and a good mix of luck and strategy for a game of its type.  No gamer should be without it.

Finally played this "classic" that people always mention. I think it was hyped up too much. There was very little there. Maybe I need to play it a second time, but I didn't care that much.

Rated in relation to other Filler games. This game is very approachable and simple to teach, but it is interesting enough to keep my interest after repeated plays. Over the course of 15+ plays I have rarely lost, so I am comfortable in asserting that this game does reward skill. Being able to read other players and predict their plays and/or bids is crucial to winning this game, and understanding the best ways to play all of the various possible sets of cards given your expectations of your opponents actions during the second phase of the game allows superior players to routinely beat new players. It is a game of valuation and prediction, with elements akin to Poker, Magic: The Gathering, and fighting games like Street Fighter. Players who are good at mind-games (predicting your opponents plays, understanding their valuation of the various cards available, etc) will find success in this game. People who aren't good at that will feel like the game takes no skill and is arbitrary and random. (Much like people often complain that Poker takes no skill and is totally random.)

Overall, excellent Filler. Fairy Tale is the only Filler that routinely competes with it for time at the table.

This game went down very well with my gaming group. I enjoyed the light nature of the game.

[June 2016 - 9.9]
I've played nearly 100 times now and it's the near-perfect game. What's great is that even though one can play a lot and developed his/her strategies, that's all thrown out the window when you play against new players. You have no idea how they'll play -- and since so much of this game is dependent on guessing what others will do, you can feel like a fish out of water. Fast... but such great roaring reaction and emotion.

[January 2015 - 9.6]
This little game is near the top of my rankings at the moment, and while that seems crazy, it really puts on a performance. There are many reasons to like it (see below), but No. 1 on my list is that it elicits such great emotions (ups and downs) in short bursts as you reveal your properties to the market in the second round. You can play the second-best card in the game and get screwed. You can play the second-worst card in the game and come away a big winner. That might sound too random for people, but it's not. You really have to think what your opponents are going to play, and that's where the emotions build up as your choosing and then revealing all your cards at the same time. Those moments are pure bliss, even if you're on the losing end, because you just laugh about it. The first round also has its moments, especially when the bids start to go high. It's a very easy game to teach, and it's very portable. There's also plenty of strategy in gauging what to bid based on how many rounds are left, what cards have already shown up and what's still to come. Pretty much everyone I've played For Sale with -- from newbie to hardcore gamer -- says the same thing after a few rounds: "What's this game called again? I'm buying it."

I've been playing this more lately as my kids have taken a real liking to it and I've come to very much appreciate what this game has to offer. It's light and quick with minimal rules overhead, but you really do need to play your fellow players and try for read what you think they are going to do. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is also variable: every group of cards will have a slightly different distribution of cards and that affects the bidding immensely. Auction/bidding games often stress me out, but this is a gem.

Everyone can relate to owning a great big house and selling it for a lot of money that's why it may appeal to a lot of people even those who aren't really into gaming. If you're a gamer in a situation where there's no one really into gaming, I think For Sale is one of these rare gems that can influence people into gaming.

An excellent light game with a clever buy/sell mechanic that means that even low valued properties, if used wisely, can still play well. I suspect the outcome of the game depends more on luck than judgement but it feels like you earned it when you win.

The fastest game I've ever played.  It's a simple bidding/auction game that plays in 15 minutes.  A little of the "playing chicken" element.  Perfect filler while waiting for someone to show up.  I'm tempted to bump it up to 7 based on that alone, but the game just doesn't call for enough skill.

Excellent little game.  Players spend their 15 chips in auctions for 20 available property cards.  Property cards are then taken in hand and sold back for 20 available money cards.  Highest total of money cards, plus left over chips, wins.  Wonderful - the perfect 15 minute filler.

RATING: 8
An entertaining auction game that can generate some fun table talk. Even when I lose, I like this game. It's just fun to get into bidding wars, and I find it entertaining when someone is forced to pay $5000 for a cardboard box or sell a mansion for nothing (even when it's me). There's a lot of psychology to the game, especially when trying to guess who is going to sell what property when. It can pay to be a little unpredictable. Plus, the artwork really engages me in the theme. I like that there is such an extreme range of property types.

[Dorra] Simple to teach and fast to play push-your luck filler! 

You can never tell whether you will be the last bidder who has to pay full price, or if you will be outbid and get to pay only half your bid. The stressful highest-bidder-pays-a-lot coupled with the take-the-lower-prize-and-get-compensated factors are what makes Taj Maal such a great game as well! But this game compresses most of the fun and a fraction of the time and complexity as Knizia's Taj Mahal.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Idea:
First bid on different houses and then sell them for maximum profit.

Mechanism:
First turn over houses in sets and each round you get 1 house (cards numbered 1-40 or so). Then turn over set of 'money' and secretly decide which house you put for sale, biggest house gets to pick money first.

to who:
Easy to learn, somewhat same idea as on Modern art for example. Houses are nicely named like 'sewers', 'dog house' and 'mansion' depending on how good they are.

Excellent artwork for this game.  I like it, people don't hate it, sometimes people really enjoy it, sometimes they are meh over it.  But I'm glad it's in my collection.  People say it's very light.  I've played this so many times now, I know that there is a pretty good underlying strategy to the game, more so than most people think.  And each phase requires you to change how you play a bit, which I like.  11/1/16: upgraded from 7.5 to 8.0.   It's easy to get out and teach people, it's fast, and the more I play it the more I see its hidden depth.

I don't understand why this is so well liked.  I enjoy the art on the cards and the 2-phased buy and sell; however, it doesn't feel like you're accomplishing much.

What a fun game! I haven't figured this one out yet and I keep losing, but I don't get sick of it after multiple consecutive plays. I can't get enough of the psychological/bluffing factor in the second round. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great filler game for six people.  It goes by very fast since you are essentially playing to somewhat different 10 minute games sequentially.  Simple rules, but a surprising amount of tension from the bluffing that occurs during auction.  Also great for teaching kids money management skills!  

However, I absolutely hate the corny artwork and poor production values of the cardboard ‘coins’ of the 2008 Eagle-Gryphon Games’ version.  Some of the fan-made print-and-play versions are better than this version.  The box is also ridiculously oversized!  I liked the older versions much better where the currency cards actually looked like miniature banker’s cheques; thematically it also made much more sense and I’m not sure what the new currency cards as supposed to be now???  Lets get some better artwork and some actual plastic coins in a new edition!   

However, my rating here is based on the actual gameplay, not the artwork or poor production value.

Good first play with 5 players. I enjoyed the tension created in the first half of the game which was similar to a dollar auction. Paying half your bid for passing is simultaneously less punishing than the full payment of a true dollar auction, and more interesting. Bidding on the chance to take a card, rather than a perfectly-knowable value, is a pleasant amount of uncertainty. The second half seemed more opaque on first play. Want to play more.

For Sale is similar to High Society. It`s the reason why I got For Sale in the first place. I wanted another game filler in my collection and heard good things about the game. I played High Society before For Sale. I never played For Sale before buying it.

Regardless that I needed another filler or not, I prefer High Society over For Sale. For Sale is a fun game to play nevertheless. Strategies differ from the two games in question but are similar in the way that each are auction games.

One of the few games where you teach only 1/2 of the game at first (with possible references to what's to come), then the rest after completing the first 1/2.  Auction bidding around the table for the first 1/2, then blind bidding with the cards won in part 1 in the second 1/2.  The fact that it plays with up to 6 works in its favor too.

For Sale is an filler auction game that plays with a large compliment of players in two distinct halves. The first half is trying to acquire property with the initial starting money each player has. Money not used in the phase will contribute towards having the most money (which wins you the game), but has no function in the second half. In the second half of the game, you're using property cards from the first phase to acquire money cards. This is a pretty easy game that's very easy to explain. It's a very popular filler game, that's also very easy to explain to new players. Definitely worth a look.

Quick and simple, but loaded with extremely interesting decisions. The auction mechanic is very compelling, and there is a little push your luck aspect there too. The selling portion is slightly less interesting, but extremely tense. Final scoring is usually very tight.

Grade A auction game filler! 

This game played just as well with 4 as it did with 6. I couldn't see 5 being any different. I would probably suggest Scripts and Scribes with 3 or 4 though. 

I've played with both bidding rulesets and the Uberplay bidding is definitely better. With "match or raise" bidding the game just goes longer, and one of the best virtues to For Sale is the speed of the game. Skip the extra bidding and keep the speed at its highest. 

9 to 8. Raj plays the second half of this game better, so I may just break out Raj instead of this game. 

8 to 7. Scripts and Scribes is better for 4 than for sale and plays in about the same time.

[3 plays] Didn't like this when I first tried it.  Any attempt to strategize felt futile; it seemed like everything was determined not by strategy and not by honest luck (like a dice roll), but by seating order.  Tried it again with fewer people (4 vs. 6 the first time) and it was less bad.  I still don't care for it, but unlike most games I have disliked, it has the merit of being extremely brief.  The suffering only lasts about 15 minutes.  Also, I will say the cards are cool looking.

El tí­pico juego rapidito, para varias personas, es muy fácil y está muy indicado para "abrir boca" en una quedada ludópata. Las cartas son muy bonitas y la dinámica del juego consta de 2 fases: 1ª comprar diferentes tipos de viviendas y 2ª venderlas por pasta. El que más pasta consiga, gana.
Las pujas iniciales pueden marcar el devenir de la partida.
PARTIDAS:
05-04-2008 8 jugadores (Chuchi, Olga, Pi, Gato, Richi, Peto, Iuliano y Charlie "salinas"); el juego es para 6 con lo cual ibamos descansando los 2 peores de la partida anterior. Chuchi ganÃ³ la primera con 51 puntos, Peto la segunda con 46 y la tercera y ultima ya no me acuerdo porque la velada fue larga y regada con calimocho y cubatillas. Iuliano y Peto quedaron fascinados por el juego.
13/04/2008 5 Jugadores (Pi, Tyrion, Juas, Maria "primita" y Gato)Jugamos 3 partidas y a pesar de que María descubría un nuevo juego nos ganó 2, y la otra para Pi; los demás a verlas venir.

(As of [b]13[/b] plays) A fairly straightforward bidding game with a fun real estate theme. Simple, easy-to-learn and very light, but with enough going on to keep people interested for several back-to-back rounds. This has gone over well with several different groups, including my non-gaming family, and is my group filler of choice.

RATING: 8.5
Auction game, inferior to Modern Art for strategy, but better as a fun filler for non-gamers.  Very accessible to new players, and the blind bidding in the second phase of the game leads to agonizing choices, similar to 6 Nimmt.

See my pictorial review here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/378346

Own the Uberplay edition.

Different editions had different rules about rounding.  The designer Dorra [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1875557#1875557]is quoted here[/url] as saying that when rounding you pay the higher amount to the bank and keep the lesser amount (the opposite way of playing is a result of a mistranslation in the German), see also [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/21973322#21973322]here[/url], and [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/21974828#21974828]here[/url].  Another interesting suggestion is this: "Actually, I prefer no rounding at all. You bid in $1000 increments, but use $500 chits for change. If you are down to your last $500 you have nothing left to bid."

Great filler game that lives up to its reputation. The auction rule where you lose half of your bid even if you don't purchase makes for some great brinksmanship, and the game is similar to my favorite filler, Scripts & Scribes with the part I (buy) and part II (sell) aspects of the game.

A very good filler, but in my group, Scripts & Scribes reigns supreme, so it doesn't come out that often.

-One of the easiest and quickest auction style game to learn and teach; good gateway game
-Fun for all ages and funny art

-Filler only

Quick, well-presented, logistically welcoming (3-6 players), attractively-themed game - it's extremely accessible and despite earlier misgivings (a year ago I wrote "not terribly deep", "wouldn't stand up to repeated play") contains a good dose of depth for its length.

RATING: 8
I used to stay far away from auction/bidding games, so when I once saw this game for sale for not even 4 euros, I didn't buy it. When later, after having experienced more and more mechanics, I found out this game rocks, I couldn't find it for under 20 euros. So it took me a while longer until I finally managed to buy me a not too overpriced copy. And it got played pretty soon after it.

I must say it's exactly what I expected it to be. A light filler game in which luck plays its part, but tactical play makes a great deal as well. And two different auction rounds. It should result in close scoring as well, though so far the same player won both games and one by quite a margin. He liked the game most, especially the opening round. While I personally prefer the second round, the blind bidding one. But overall, I like it and rate it an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A fun and fast card game. First round is buying properties and the second is selling them for victory points. Because the game is played in two rounds, you have to be thinking ahead and watch the other players carefully in order to compete. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Update:  Ok, I prefer High Society because it's quicker and simpler.

My rating here is low because I'm not a big fan of filler games.  Having said that For Sale is solid game and my family liked it.  I just don't enjoy fillers as much as other people do.  I realize this is a fine game, but it doesn't seem interesting.  The real-estate theme is dry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Excellent filler. Easy to teach, plays in 10-15 minutes, great looking, and a lot of fun. The 2 different halves of the game is pretty cool. The 2nd half plays in about 2 minutes while the first half is a great little auction game. Not as good as High Society or other similar filler games, but still fun.

RATING: 4
[Auction, Blind Bidding, Filler] [5P:4, 6P:4] Sorry Geekbuddies, but I really don't see what the fuss is about. This game is not better than High Society. It's faster, it's lighter, and it's far more random than HS. That makes it not worthy to lick High Society's muddy boots. I had my suspicions due to the blind bidding, so I'm glad I didn't buy it. Not a favorite, and will likely not play again even if it is just 15 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I love games with this theme! It's super easy to teach, but the decisions it presents make it a great filler/gateway game. Plays up to 6! 

For some reason, though, this one doesn't appeal to all in the same way as it does to me (not even my ultimate gaming friends) and nobody ever seems to suggest we play it but me. I think it's partly because it's too similar to many of the other games in my collection (lots of bidding and trick taking), and they don't appreciate the theme. 

I also prefer High Society to this so this one is going to get played less and less.

For Sale and Hey! That's My Fish can't be beat for best games that take 20 minutes or less.  It's almost 2 games in one with the 2 very different phases: auctioning off the properties and then playing them to get the highest possible cheques.  You have to be reasonably good at doing both or you won't win.  Simultaneous card playing like in phase 2 is always fun.

ROUND 1: Open bidding/auction round with lots of painful decisions, and little resources.  ROUND 2: A sort of blind bidding round to make your money back.

For Sale might be the prototypical filler card game. It isn't very deep and there is quite a bit of luck involved but it is usually over in 15 to 20 minutes tops and always a lot of fun. Absolutely great if you need to waste a few minutes until the game on the next table is finished as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I consider this to be the perfect filler game.  If there's a game night and we're still waiting for people to show up, this will be my suggestion every time.  Light weight bidding/bluffing with great artwork, the perfect way to start or end a solid night of gaming.

RATING: 7.9
VERY solid fast filler. great with 5 or 6 players when you are waiting on someone to arrive or only have a brief time to game.  Game night isnt about playing this game, but its thinkiness to playtime ratio is really good and worth a spot in anyone's collection for the niche it fills.

RATING: 6
FOR SALE ist ein klassisches Versteigerungszockspiel aus vergangenen Tagen, in denen das Immobiliengeschäft noch weniger kapitalverrucht war als in der heutigen, maßlosen neoliberalen Wirklichkeit. FOR SALE unterteilt seine Versteigerung in zwei gleiche Teile: Phase 1 Hauskauf, Phase 2 Hausverkauf. Und wer zum Schluß die höchste Schecksumme gescheffelt hat, ist der Sieger. Die Wertsteigerung mit Ziel einer positiven Handelsbilanz bildet Hab- und Geldgier im Kapitalismus gut wenn auch unabsichtlich ab. Was nur als friedliches Spiel gedacht ist und auch nichts anderes sein will, lässt sich heute als spielerisches Lehrstück für die oberste Prämisse im Kapitalismus begreifen: Profit über alles! FOR SALE ist ein gutes Beispiel, dass man im Spiel Dinge, Systeme und Verhältnisse ganz anschaulich und einfach begreifen kann, was sogenannte Wirtschaftsexperten und Finanzelite in ihrem umständlichen Geschwafel zu verschleiern versuchen.

Another game that is so simple yet so much fun! ANYONE CAN LEARN TO PLAY THIS GAME.  That point needs to be made, because it is a huge selling point in my opinion.  Like so many of the games in my collection, I am unsure how to rate this one because of its lightness. Consider the score a 9 if you are looking for a light, quick, fun card game.  

update: my non-gamer parents enjoy this one, earning it more points in my book.

RATING: 6.312
Simple enjoyable quick auction game - a most agreeable filler for starting the game session off when distractions are around, or at the end of night as a quick closer.  I particular also like how the second phase is quicker than the first gives the game a nice internal  momentum.  Light but definitely not fluffy, and scales well from 3 to 6 players, but I'm fear would begin to fade with excessive play (14/12/08).  UPDATE: Alas, I am now fully familiar with the game, and so there is no the interest to bring it to the table (except when trying to entice newbies), rating change from 7 to 6 (21/6/09). UPDATE: Probably not a game to bring out with gamers, but for newbies, a really nice burly into the world of social board gaming (Rating 6.312, Dec 16)

A delightful, fast-play auction game, that has a neat mechanic, snazzy artwork, and simple rules for anybody.  Amazingly, for such a simple game, For Sale captures the "buy-low-sell-high" feeling of turning real estate extremely well.  A great game all on its own.

RATING: 10
Absolutely one of my favorite games.  I've yet to introduce this game to someone who didn't like it.  More often than not one play is immediately followed by another. The rules are simple: one round of increasing bid auctions, followed by one round of hidden auctions selling the cards you just bought.  I always find the play fascinating and unpredictable.

The king of all auction games. Fast, fun, and furious - exactly what an auction game should be. Buying low and selling high is not enough to win; must also see what your opponents are doing. Ability to bluff well gives a clear edge. My favorite filler at the moment, along with Incan Gold.

A really excellent lightweight game.  It plays well with just a couple of folks on up to 6, and really doesn't drag with larger groups.  The game strategy changes halfway through, so there's no long stretch of doing the same thing over and over.  This is one of my main filler games for when the group has fifteen minutes to spare, but I have to play it from time to time even when time's not an issue, just because it's such a neat little game.

9/28/09 - 7 plays - This has become my number one favorite filler.  Only downside is it doesn't play 2 player.  But it's good with 3, and great with 4-6.  Easy to teach, easy to learn, and quick.  Teaching games still usually take less than 30 minutes, and once everyone knows it, usually only takes 10-15.

RATING: 5.5
Quick and fun filler. Good for getting a bunch of non-gamer friends to play and have a good time. Love the humor in the types of real estate available. 

I prefer the travel edition--the regular edition box is just a waste of space. The travel edition has the same cards, but with small, thin coins, which doesn't matter to me, because I use my own metal coins anyway.

Update: I don't really reach for fillers these days, and this one hasn't seen play for quite a while.

This is a solid filler, so don't expect anything more.
This has had a lot of success in my non-gamer groups recently. I don't know if it will ever get pulled out with the serious strategists, but if another couple comes over for dinner I know I can always break this out for a couple quick plays and some good times.
The switch from phase one to phase two involves some different tactics and guessing, which makes the game pretty fun given its short play time.

Great artwork, great quality bits although the game could fit in a much smaller box.  Great combo of two types of auctions.

Philistine! I hear you say. Heathen! How could you rate such a light and silly game so highly?

Well, show me another game that's so simple, so pretty, so successful with new players, and still fun after hundreds of plays, and I'll reconsider. This is the one game that no-one will ever object to playing.

Surely one of the best games ever designed. Quick and fun. Beautiful illustrations on the cards. Every group I've taught this to LOVED it, and I would teach it to anybody, even that wrinkled old northerner sitting in the corner supping a stale pint of Bass who says he'd rather eat his grandmother than play a bloody board game.

Hard to do better in just 10-15 minutes.  I prefer the Uberplay bidding rules, where bids must be increased rather than matched.  With the original rules, the game actually drags a little bit.  However, I think it's best to use the original rules for rounding (always in a player's favor when reclaiming half of their bid).

RATING: 8
One of the best short auction style games. It is easy to learn and you have to deduct what other players think.

The problem is that money is too scarce in the game, that when it comes to your turn you almost have to pass because the price is too high. The winner of a bid has too much power. Would love to play this with alternative rules.

Ingatlanbáróként megpróbálod a legértékesebb eladásokat nyélbe ütni a játék során. Olcsón venni jót és drágábban eladni. Ennek megfelelően az első forduló köreiben a játékosok a rendelkezésre álló és eltitkolt mennyiségű pénzükért licitálnak a felcsapott ingatlanokra (1-30 közötti minőségben, ahol 1 a hajléktalan doboza és 30 az űrállomásod). Majd a megszerzett ingatlanokkal próbálod a legzsírosabb csekkeket megszerezni (0 – 15.000 érték között) a másodikban.
Egyszerű szabályok, gyors játékmenet, nagy szerencse és kis taktika. Minél többen játsszátok annál jobb. Remek kis licitálós játék.

I sometimes wonder what people mean when they use the term "filler" since they often apply it to games that I see as meaty enough to be played between "filler" games. Well, with For Sale, I have for sure come across a game that I would call filler without hesitation. Maybe even a filler for filler. Nothing really wrong with it, but I can't see wanting to play it much as long as there is time to play a longer more involved game.

RATING: 7
The archetypal "filler game" really lives up to the expectations I had going in. It scales well up to six players, provides interesting (and sometimes difficult) decisions, plays very quickly, and provides the perfect balance of luck and skill for a game of this type. 

The illustrations are delightful and provide a great hook (even though the thematic integration is very thin). Players may even value cards more highly than they ought to simply because they like the dwelling (or even the pet) depicted. 

An experienced player has a definite edge in terms of card valuation, but the blind bidding element creates enough chaos that even a new player can pull off a surprising win. There are a lot of different elements that work very well together here, which makes it enjoyable even to experienced gamers. And yet this is one of the first games I would pull out to introduce someone to "those weird games" they've never heard of. 

Cheap, portable, accessible, fun, strategic, and scale-able. It's one of those games that just does everything right. Even so, I can't imagine this being anyone's favorite game. It's a great diversion or introduction, and succeeds mightily as a filler game, but after a few plays you will probably be craving something with a bit more substance.

Memory (of what cards have already been auctioned and played) is critical in this game.  Strategy is important, but not nearly as important as memory, so it's not usually a very enjoyable game for me.  But it's quick and easy  -- 20-30 minutes max for a whole game, including teaching the game.

[Initial Impression: 8]
A fast and fun auction game, with a plausible economic theme.  The first round involves players bidding money chips to "stay in" (i.e., try to take a higher value real estate card) or passing to take the lowest card.  The second round involves blind bidding using the real estate cards to obtain checks that will score at the end of the game.  It's easy and fairly intuitive to explain, quick to play, and involves some bluffing and psychology, especially in the blind bidding round. Be frugal in buying and shrewd in bidding to become the richest real estate magnate of all.

It even delivers a small narration with it's two phases.

I wasn't expecting too much from this little filler game but was quite surprised.  It's actually pretty deep for the simplicity of it and it's very fun too.  The two different mechanics of bidding work together very well.

It's hard to pinpoint why I can't rate this higher than an 7 but it just doesn't have quite the depth I would need I suppose.  It's a fun game that I'd definitely play again.

I think that this is a good game has a few different aspects to think about like how much to bet getting the high or middle range cards and then bidding them for checks of up to 15 thousand dollars this has a very nice combo making it very enjoyable it is also a fast game so if you dont have much time it is perfect if you like this game i also recommmend Moderen Art this game is a little longer but still has the betting aspect i rated this a 7 because i like a little bit more building games where you take something and add on to it for a longer amount of time this game doesnt have this i wish it would have more of this if it did i would rate it in the 8 area tho it is for fast times for the family to sit down and play a fast board game

very simple gameplay plays well over lunch at the office.  Easy to learn but rather hard to master.  It's always entertaining when you happen upon a high numbered property for a low bid, and spend a lot for a modest property.

Involved or deep game: no.
Fun simple game with more depth than it appears: definitely.

This is perhaps the best filler, ever, to pull out when you need to fill time, or to introduce folks to a little bit more complicated game, or to be silly, or all of the above, simultaneously.

Bluffing, guessing, auctions, it's all here in a short little game that can be played in minutes, and then probably played again (and again).

The components of this edition are fine, but basically you have a half deck of cards with houses, a half deck with checks and a stack of chips- this packs very small, and requires no board.

I rate this a 7, not because it isn't fantastic, but because there is only so much that one can get- or wants to add- in a game like this one.

But it's practically perfect for what it is.

This is a great little auction game!  Every time I have introduced it, to gamers and non, they have stopped at the 2nd round and said "wait a minute, I see where this is going!"  I call it "Flip this House", and only explain the first half until we all have our house cards, and then explain the reselling part.

The down side, early big bids by new players can seriously hamper them later.  It takes a few turns for players to see the advantage of being the second-highest bidder.  That being said, it is a simple auction game that can be played in less than 20 minutes.  It obviously can't hold up to a whole evening of game playing.

A "stupid fun" game, I suppose, without the fun. Yeah, there's probably some thinking involved, but I don't have the energy to figure this one out. I'd rather not waste my time on such stupid filler games.

Update (7/11/09): Well, when you've got 20 minutes and six people, and can't decide what to play... this may fit the bill. I've upped it to a '5', because there are elements of card trick taking. We had a pretty close game with 6P. Not too bad.

Update (06/18/10): After playing this a number of times since my last comment, I now appreciate the simplicity of gameplay, and depth of strategy, all within a 20 minute timeframe. A perfect filler. Upping to an "8".

Update (1/7/11): Hasn't seen much play lately. I couldn't stand my last game I played of this, especially when playing nothing but light games all day. I'm bouncing around with the verdict on this one. Dropping it to a '7'.

Update (02/02/2014) 14 plays: with 3-players, there is not enough variety of cards per turn to make the bidding interesting. It's just another way to kill the time until all the players show up. That's not saying much about this design. Holding precariously at "7".

There’s a whole subclass of games that get high marks as “filler” games—5 to 15 minutes of 5 to 15 minutes’ worth of fun. They deliver, but they don’t put out.

For Sale is widely rumored to be among this group, and I just don’t see it. I like it better than [thing=917]Rack-O[/thing], and indeed it fired Rack-O for me. Like in Rack-O, you’re trying to choose where to stick in your cards to get them in the right position; unlike Rack-O it has peppy art and a double layer of auctions.

Bidding for property cards in the first round is reminiscent of the popular Rack-O draft variant; trying to put your oar in at just the right times in the second round is like trying to reassemble a spilled card catalogue: You make an educated guess about where your card corresponds to the overall scheme of things and hope for the best. At least that’s how I put together card catalogues.

For Sale isn’t the filler to end all fillers, and at my table it paled in comparison to [thing=220]High Society[/thing]; but I can’t deny I get a certain enjoyment out of playing it from time to time, and it’s worth keeping to play with the kids early on.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

One of my favorite introductory games!  The opening Phase allows players to duke it out, head to head, surpassing one another's bids.  It plays out almost like a hand of Texas Hold'Em, with people using their cash stack to knock others out of the bidding.  Then, Phase 2 kicks in and the mind games start..."what are they gonna put down for this check?  Low Card?  High Card?  Is it worth it to me to burn my 27 for a $12k check?"  If you are trying to convert any of the massive number of Hold'Em players out there to Euros, I recommend you start with this.

A simple two-stage bidding game that's effectively an extension to Raj in that you bid for the currency in the first round that you'll use for blind bidding in round two. This is a filler that I've warmed to over the years, you need to realise that your play is driven by the range of card values on the table, but I wouldn't call it the 'best filler ever', there's a big chaos factor at work so it needs as much luck as skill.

One of my favorite "appetizer"/filler games.  I can never remember the designer's original intent for rounding up/down on the bidding process.

It's a great filler game that I'd recommend giving a try and consideration for a game filler every now and then.  If you're not into bidding type games, then you might thing otherwise however.  You have two phases, an open bidding phase followed by a closed bidding phase.

RATING: 8.2
So far, I haven't met anyone who does not enjoy this game.  I like the quick 10-15 minute play time and the unique market mechanics.  If there is a flaw, I would say it has to do with turn order.  The combination of random card drawing with turn order can put players into a very unbalanced situation.  A couple of nasty turns can pretty much knock a player out of contention.  That said, game play is pretty much guaranteed to be less than 15 minutes, so the misery is short lived.  

While strategy is important in this game, randomness is also very high.  I'd say it is darn near balanced on this continuum.  The turn order aspect knocks it down a few notches in my overall rating; however, it is tons of fun, easy to learn and play, affordable, compact and transportable, and repayable.  I recommend it.

It's a simple, very very simple auction game, it's so simple that I have played this system many years ago, when I was a child, with every soccer or basketball stickers with any stats. Now it's a popular board game... and it sells well. 0 in innovation, but the concept is good enough. So it deserves a 6 imho.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable auction game, with plenty of tension and tough decision making throughout.  Players are trying to get a hand of high value properties in order to sell them at the end of the game to get the best prices available.  The fact that you are bidding to not have to take the worst card on the table in each round makes it interesting, as you have to judge when is the best time to pull out from the auction and cut your losses.

The endgame round is fun, as you are second-guessing your opponents' choices of property to sell - the player who played the highest value property gets to pick first and the player who played the lowest value picks last.

The game needs a few people in order to play it well, but it's worth it.

This game is very easy to teach and play,plus it ends quickly (to start a new game, again !!)
From my 4 players game experience, all players got hooked and played again and again and again for straight two or three hours !!
There seems some kind of strategy inside this gem, yet we have to discover by playing again and again :P
(plus, the components are very few, which is a plus to me)
Highly recommended !

One of my favorite fillers, but for some reason it doesn't seem to get played as often as I would like.  The two auction phases in the game is what makes this fun for me.  Knowing when to play the highest card/bid the highest is the key to this game.

The art on the cards are great too.  You sometimes want to win a certain card because of what the location is... or at least I did.

I've fallen in love with this game with time. I rarely give such a high rating to a simple game like this one.
It's not fully controllable, but it's short and _FUN_ so it's not that essential.

Probably top 3 of all-time 20-30min. fillers.

--

2015-2016 edition is HORRIBLE.  The artwork is completely lifeless and indistinct.  I hate it.
Huge square box is suitable for heavy 2-3h games, not for a tiny filler and is the first thing you should burn down - immediately - if you ever get hold of this edition.

RATING: 7
Perfect filler as everyone says, fast and fun for 3 to 5 in 10 - 15 minutes. So fast  and enjoyable that another round is almost mandatory.

Clever game where buildings 1 - 20 are auctioned off and then later used in round 2 to blind bid your way into some cash amounts which are 0 - 20. 

One of the best fillers I have played. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8 => 7 Not very much to explore here, it feels very shallow (is there a such thing as a deep filler? maybe TTD), even compared to Blokus Trigon so the rating falls a little but it will still see occasional play when time is an issue or for warm-up

This is a very good and VERY fast auction card game. This is the perfect filler and great for new players.  It's easy to teach and to understand and plays in about 5 minutes which makes it a great lunchtime game.

Perfect filler game.  Quick, scalable, teachable in 2 minutes, has some strategy based on the randomness of the cards and assessing the development of both markets (first the supply market of properties, then the demand market of buyers).  Different every time due to random rollout of properties and then checks, and number of players and bidding styles.  A classic.  Probably a pretty good gateway game.  And can play in 10 minutes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
During phase 1 of our first game, I thought the game was going to be a dud. None of us had any idea how much to bid on any of the properties. Phase 2 was really exciting, though. For our second game, phase 1 was a lot more tense as we had an idea what were going to use our properties for during phase 2. This is a good game. I really like the different feel the two phases have.

I haven't given this a high rating, however it's a great game in the right situation.  For me that situation is when I'm with my parents.  They are both non-gamers, and they both enjoy this one.  

It does reward good decisions and skillful hand management, but the randomness overpowers this a little too much for my taste.

For a filler card game with gamers, I'd rather play Money.  For family filler, this is the one.

Excellent light bidding/auction game. In the first half of the game players acquire property cards. In the second half, those same properties are sold, hopefully as dearly as possible. Most money at the end of the game wins.

Very much in the same style as Knizia's various bidding games, but simpler and faster. Comparable with Knizia's High Society in depth and playing time. Nice mix of analysis and luck. Good, fast filler. As a filler, easily a '9' or '10', so my rating merely reflects my bias in gaming.

Good light game. I have played it twice now and it has begun to grow on me, I love auction games. The game can be explained under 3 minutes, have lots of hard decisions and it plays very quickly, also it has a surprising (and satisfying depth). It can accommodate 6 players without adding significantly to the play time, a huge plus for me. The art in the cars is ok and adequate. 

This is the perfect game to play with the family or to attract new players to our hobby.

In conclusion, great filler, I believe it will go up in my ratings with more plays. I will always carry it with me.

I have cooled a lot toward the game. It is still in my collection but I don’t want to play it often (if ever). It is not a bad game but it leaves me very unsatisfied, perhaps I need something heavier.

If this trend continue for me, I will get rid of it in the near future. The only reason I still have it is that it is very easy to teach.

(I don't own this. No good 2P variant I'm aware of.)

We've only played one session. Seems like a pretty decent really light game, easy to teach. Another "psycho analyze your opponents, or just heck with it play pretty much at random" game. In looking for a good auction game I was tossing up between this and Modern Art to try to play with my almost-a-gamer missus and some of her family. (We bought Modern Art.) Comparatively... Modern Art is a little too intricate for her as yet and For Sale feels perhaps a little too random.

RATING: 4
Short and snappy which makes you want 'just another game'.  Not sure if the initial bidding round has some problems.  Further plays have revealed the initial bidding round quite often throws up a split of cards which causes logical bidding that falls over with the first and last out doing very badly.
Played again and still can't see why this is rated so highly - the initial bidding round needs some tweaking imo

Maybe the perfect filler in terms of play time, ease of explanation and luck/strategy.  I prefer playing with the player counts where random cards are removed to avoid perfect information but would play just about anytime I'm asked.

One of kids favorites! The game is played in two halves, buying houses then selling houses. Everyone starts with the same amount of money and properties equaling the number of players are turned face up. On your turn you have two options bid (more than the previous bid) or pass (take half you bid back and take the lowest valued property still available). If you are the last person you get the best property on the table but don't get any of your bid back.
This continues until all the houses in the deck have been bought.
Then cards with a monetary value are placed on the table (equaling the number of players). Each player chooses a property card and reveals it at the same time. Again the highest valued property gets the greatest money cardand so on. After all the rounds of selling houses are over the person with the most money wins.
I recommend this one with younger kids to teenagers.

Quick, quick, quick filler.  I love how the unpredictable distribution of the checks in the second auction leads to groans and cheers, as players find themselves grossly over- and under-paying for their victory points.

Bare-bones bidding and bluffing game, quick and elegant; a personal favorite.  I'm absolutely in love with the double-layered bidding, in which the second auction is bid on using cards won during the first auction.  (Note: I am a *major* math geek, and therefore probably rating the game more highly than you would.)

One of my all-time favorite fillers.  I like it especially with 3 players.  I find it fascinating that it's the relative value of your cards that are important, not their exact values.  I've only played non-Uberplay versions, and have no intention of ever changing that (why do companies insist on mucking with the rules to perfectly good games??).

For Sale is a game that is able to played in 15 minutes and still able to stand up as a great game in its own right.  Those who hate auctioning need not apply, but for those who enjoy the back and forth nature of the auction will certainly enjoy it here.  I really like how money is constantly moving about during the auction phase with players who choose to bid and then pass still having a penalty of the removal of half of their bid money.  The second phase is also excellent in allowing players a choice of which of their properties they think will make the most money.  Excellent game.

RATING: 7
Really good filler game that I would happily play. The game has two phases. The first phase involves bidding on different types of real estate. The second phase is selling off the real estate. This is done by revealing checks with dollar amounts and then each player takes one of her real estate holdings and all players simultaneously reveal the properties. The person who revealed the most valuable property takes the most valuable check and so on. This continues until all the checks have been collected. The player with the most money in checks at the end wins the game.

Good, easy-to-pick up, quick playing game. Highly likely to play a few times in a row. Although there's no direct interaction, you can get kind of cut-throat with the bidding. I do like the remove-some-cards variations a little better, since it makes knowing just what to bid a lot on less certain and more fun.

I got this from BGG secret santa this year! I taught it to some friends over for dinner, ranging from casual to non-gamers, and all really enjoyed it. I used Tom Vasel's tip of first just teaching and playing the first half, then teaching and playing the second half; that worked well. This is a light, intuitive auction game that has won a permanent place in my rotation. Playing it for the first time is particularly fun as we see each property for the first time; the art is really clever (ranging from a box to a space station), and the artist has put in all kinds of little details like a relevant animal on each property. As much as I enjoyed it, I don't see it ever going higher than 8/10 due to the lightness.

Update:
After 7 plays, downgrading from 8.2 to 6.8.
Mostly due to two factors:
1. It's really just too light for me.  When I want to play light casual games with non-gamers, there are others I'd rather play than this, like Incan Gold.
2. To do well, you really have to remember (in the 2nd phase) who has already played what.  I don't really enjoy memory mechanisms, it feels too much like a chore.

So those two factors mean this one is probably headed for the trade pile.  The art really is nice though, it's my favorite part of the game.

Update: Traded away in Math Trade for Fearsome Floors.

For Sale is the ultimate buy low, sell high game. That's all it is. It becomes indecently fun, though, when you're forced to manage your modest starting cash over several turns, trying to stick other players with over-expensive bids while grabbing the best deals. The game really depends on the turn sequence and you have to concentrate on your place in the wheel. You can play well, but the variety of properties to buy / checks to collect, combined with the anticipation of 3-5 other players (I wouldn't play with fewer than four and recommend up to six) makes it impossible to make perfect moves. Simple, addictive, replayable, and charming. The artwork does a LOT to encourage easy-going table-talk. Along with No Thanks!, this is your best bet for gaming in under 20 minutes. Recommended.

I appreciate that it packs a fair bit of punch into 15 minutes, but in my opinion this is overrated around here. My problem is with the bidding in the first phase, it feels like there's little to no room for creative play there and turn order determines how well you do in each auction. 

The original "Poker style" auction rules are better than the ones published by Uberplay, but they don't fix the seating order issue.

A *very* light filler, but decent. It requires some group psychology work to guess whether people are going to stay in or exit early; plus there's the money management (can't spend too much too soon). For a ten-minute game, you can't expect a whole lot better than this.

This is a quick filler about reading your opponents, a Vizzini-type game if there ever was one. This is my go-to 10 minute game.

Favorite mechanism: what I call the "split". In a given set of cards, what matters is not the absolute value, but their relative value to one another: bidding is much more important if the cards are 1-3-4-22 than 26-27-28-29; the same can be said of the cheque cards.

Light family/filler game
New Iello version! Superb artwork!
Filler games are great in many situations. Like between games, or when you do not have much time, or when you just want some quick fun with the family, kids. For sale is great in this scale. Rating is as a filler game. 
The new artwork is so good, that the children sometimes want a card upon its cuteness, not its value... but this just adds to the fun!
Thumbs up!

RATING: 8
A light, easy-to-understand game that has two parts - an open auction in which you are strongly constrained by the small amount of money you have at your disposal, and in which passing may pay off in the second auction - and a closed auction in which you must decide how to make best use of your weak cards as well as your strong cards.

A great little filler, engaging, fast, and enjoyable.

Handles 6 and within 15 minutes!  Only Diamant in my group can say the same, although with less strategy (imho)

A near perfect filler;  Score is relative of that!

[LUP 17-Jun-2006] Initial rating based on one play and one observation.  Thanks to Neil (nnf1) for teaching this on the Saturday night of the innaugural Australian Games Expo.  A nice quick bidding game, I'm not sure if Daughter the Elder is old enough for this, but we might try it out with her soon.  Picked it up from Alison and Neil (Caterpillar Games)the next day.

Based on 50+ plays.  For Sale is another enjoyable, light filler.  Given its short time frame and basic rules, I can hardly begrudge it for not playing like Europe Engulfed.  I play with a variant that allows a player to call so as long as the previous player did not call.  I find it adds a little more strategy to the first phase without much additional time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game is accessible, fast and clever. The first part is a normal auction with a little twist where only the winning players pays all their money while others get the keep the half of their bid. So you want to go out of the round not as the last person but the second to last one. In other words you want to win until the end where you want to be second. The second part is also quite clever. You need to bid high if the variance is big on the money cards otherwise you get rid of your weak cards to make decent money even with the garbage you have. This game is brilliant and with a price like that every gamer should own it.

2015-10-13 - 6 - With all the hype it didn't impress me, but it's a quick nice filler which I can play almost anytime, but probably not two times in a row.

2017-01-20 - 6-> 7,5 - I played again without overhyped expectations and with larger group and it is a really good quick auction filler game, which indeed can be played few times in a row. Such a game, which works well with 3-6 players, is really useful addition to any collection.

RATING: 8
After many plays I still like this for the speed and ease of play, but still have no idea what a winning strategy comprises. I'm usually a terrible judge of bidding an appropriate amount in an auction game, whether it's somewhat calculable or not, and so it seems to be the case here, too, even in such a simplified context. 'Wait - wait - wait - spend way too much' seems to be my dominant pattern of wrongness.

This game went surprisingly well with younger kids. I cannot win this game to save my life. I lost a game against two 8 year olds, and I had the 30,29,and 28 plus nothing less than 9! One of my opponents decided to play all of her houses from lowest to highest. The other kid did the exact opposite. I knew exactly what was going on, but I couldn't pull out a win.

RATING: 9
As I age and find that my predictable time to play games with the same people wanes I'm finding that the criteria for what makes a "good" game is changing. A good set of criteria for a good game that's going to make it to the table, in my mind, looks something like this now:

1) Can I teach the game to someone that's never played it in 5 minutes?

2) Are there rules that can be forgotten or misunderstood that could break a game for someone, new or old?

3) Does it play quick enough that no one's going to be stuck playing a game they hate for 3 hours?

4) Does it have enough meat such that people feel their victory or defeat was the product of their decisions, even of they come from inexperience?

The best game is the one you play. Die Macher's fabulous - for the 2 times I've played it, each of which took the grater part of an afternoon between the game and learning the game. I've probably played For Sale a hundred times or more and have never had a single person _hate_ it. It's not a game a friend calls me up itching to play, either. Expensive for a deck of cards, but a great value based on the amount of time I've spent playing it.

For what it is there are few, if any, games that do what For Sale does better. Filler games never get the respect they deserve, and that's really sad.

RATING: 8
Exceedingly well incorporated bidding and bluffing mechanics.  Fast play, and easy to pick up.  What's not to like?

Except, of course, that these days real estate just doesn't have the same appeal it had back when they published the game. Not the game's fault, obviously, but still.

I so hated this game when I played someone else's copy once because they taught the rules but I had absolutely no idea how much to bid.  So now I always tell people think 1, 2, or 3 only with 5 being a massive extreme.  Seems to work much betterI really do like the double game in this one where you bid and then bid again with what you won the first time around.  So much better than No Thanks! And this worked just fine for three players as well.  Enjoyable filler game.

Auction filler game, that is still very fun and exciting. The best strategical value in this one is out thinking what your opponent's are likely to do, especially in the selling phase. One that I would like to carry around with me at all times just to toss on the board and play if I had 15 minutes.

It's one shortcoming is a lack of depth, but I don't think this is an intentional goal of the game. It is unashamedly what it is... a filler.

11.25  transport 0.4

Described by many of my geekfriends as the best filler.  And its not far off.
After looking for one minute at the game you get the rules.
It feels a tiny bit like Ra.
Because you use the properties from the first phase to earn your checks
(instead of suns from the previous round). 

strangely enough my non gaming friends who ask for flashenteufel and Pickomonio didn' t like this. 

Edit 1 march 2012 :after almost 5 years we revisited For Sale

It's a solid 7. It's too light for an 8 but it is perfect 
fo what it is. Not for everyone though.

Upped rating to 7.75 goes in the bag for more plays

So, if you did good in first game, you will do even better in second. If you did bad in first game, you will most certainly lose. I have very little sympathy for this game.

RATING: 7
An excellent filler.  There's certainly some skill in seeing the spread and determining relative worth of the properties, and trying to get out of a bidding war without getting stuck with winning and having to pay the full bid amount (it's a bit like playing chicken).  I'm terrible at it. But it's easy to teach and understand, and most people enjoy playing it.

For Sale is a game that will never leave my collection. Lots of fun to play. Easy for beginners and they still have an okay chance to win.

I'm slightly addicted to the solo variant I made.  It's quick, tense, and well balanced.  It actually feels as if you were playing against another opponent as well.  Most games come out to 2-5 points difference (out of 90 or so).  It is a good 10 minute solo game if you need a diversion.

8/09 I got this to fill the "Filler" spot in my collection.  While I've played it a few times to fill in gaps, like a filler should, I probably wouldn't play it if I had a better option available, as I didn't have much pure fun while playing

1/10 Update: I pretty much have replaced this with Blokus for a quick and easy game

For such short rules, For Sale provides a very nice filler that takes a little thought and a little luck (as well as reading your opponents).  It's certainly fast enough to play a couple of times in one sitting, and the decisions give you something to consider, though it's not challenging enough to play too many games in succession.

Nice filler: not unique or anything, but because one game takes just 15 minutes and this IS auction game - I like it.

Many players like to compare this and High Society / Einfach Tierish, so here is mine opinion too: I think High Society is a lot of better than For Sale: 
1) In High Society, money is VERY important: if you have least money, you'll automatically loose! Little detail, but it really makes the game much much better.
2) In High Society, you don't know when the game ends: It might end after only few cards has been auctioned OR the game takes more rounds because the 'game-end' card is in the bottom of the deck.

For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great filler game in general and beyond that a great pure auction game with the interesting twist of having 2 seperate gmae phases.

The only somewhat negative aspect I can think of is that rounds with cards that have bigger value gaps are more interesting (for example: 2, 5, 25, 28 instead of 15, 16, 17, 18), but that random variance is an inherent part of the random card draw and over time it balances itself out.

A clever two act game. Both acts work to create tension at decision points. The second act has a clear change of pace, moving the dramatic arc forward, but is similar enough that it doesn't break the flow and energy.

This is a great game of positioning, bluffing, and playing/reading other players.

You always feel like you're making meaningful decisions, but you never have enough control to let skilled play guarantee a win, keeping the game interesting to all, and making it a great experience for a broad audience.

Lightning fast auction game that's easy as hell to pickup & teach.  Really impressive game that everyone can enjoy and that makes a terrific filler.  The art on the uberplay/gryphon edition is also awesome and gets some laughs (sewer selling for 10M anyone).  On the downside, it is somewhat repetitive and does get old relatively fast, but assuming you don't play more than a couple games of this in the same evening, this is a game you need to own.

A very quick "filler" bidding game in two phases, where first half is a progressive turn-based bidding/auction to acquire currency (checks) so that, in second phase, you use your checks for simultaneous bidding/auction to buy one realty from each community lot of house cards.  It's crazy fun! but quick, light.  The key trick lies in anticipating what your opponents might do.  

My rating is for my preferred original edition rules, which you can simply edit/use with the new Uberplay edition components...

Just about everyone I've introduced this to demands to replay it immediately.  And why not?  The games are 10 minutes long and full of a surprising amount of tough decisions and twists.

This is a top-three gateway game for me.  Great way to introduce heavier auction games or risk-management games.

Neither the first phase nor the second phase is very interesting on its own, but the combination of the two -- knowing that phase one is preparing for phase two, and playing phase two while remembering what everyone has collected in phase one -- is extremely fascinating.

By any metric -- sales price, box size, or playing time -- this game provides an absurdly high return on investment.

The nice theme puts it over the top for me.  I find the progression from cardboard box to space station really amusing.  Also love the little animals visible in each card.  Bonus:  can you find the animal in the Space Station card?

A very simple and quick game, the play is broken down into two stages.  Everyone starts off with the same amount of money.  In the first round, you use your money to bid on property cards.  However many players there are (need at least 3), you lay that many cards out.  Property cards have point values on them.  Once these have all been bid on (every player will have the same amount of cards), the second round begins where you use your property cards to bid on monetary value cards. At the end, everyone has unloaded their property cards and the winner is whoever has the most money. Quick, fun and it helps to have a small player screen (I used the box lid) so no one knows how much money you have remaining.

Inspired. It doesn't over-stay its welcome and the two mechanisms actually work well together.

In comparison to Turn the Tide (also blind-bidding), For Sale is very light and quick, whereas Turn the Tide is much longer and more balanced in that everyone plays the same hands. I like Turn the Tide, but For Sale is done before the blind-bidding can get old.

The only issue is figuring out which set of rules are "correct".

This is a nice little auction game.  The simple rules, attractive art, and theme make it very easy to bring out to a large group of people.  I've been able to play this with my parents successfully and they've had a lot of fun with it.  The two different auctions are fun (first investing in the properties and then selling them) and since the properties and checks come pre-valued makes the auctions more psychological---what do you bid to beat the other players?  A very nice game, but it's just a shame that it (and most auction games) don't work that well with just two players, with the exception of the great Ra.

I overpaid $35 to get a copy of this because it was so highly reviewed and had been out of print for a while.  In retrospect--yes, it's a very nice filler game.  But no, I overpaid.

With that being said, I'm probably never going to get rid of it either.

One of the best auctioning games I'm aware of.  Hard to see how a light auctioning game could be better in the fundamental concept.  HOWEVER I dock this a little because I want an expansion that gives me a little more to do.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun 15 minute auction game is a hard thing not to like (unless you’re one of those weirdos that hates auctions ;). With not one but two different auctions packed into that time frame, For Sale is doubly difficult to hate.

Why For Sale succeeds so well, though, is how the auctions are connected to each other. The winnings in the first auction are the currency you use in the second auction. This, the random drawing of auction slates (each player wins one card form each slate) and the blind bidding (which I normally only tolerate, but quite like in this instance) introduce a nice level of uncertainty, and makes the game much more replayable that it might seem at first blush. The blind bidding also works nicely thematically, as you are, mechanically, bidding on cheques (lots of VPs) using properties you bought in the first auction. It takes a second to twist your brain around it, but it makes good thematic sense. When you hear the game described, it seems like it should be pretty calculable, but in practise you have to think on your feet quite a bit.

One small note: The rules call for randomly removing a few cards from each of the decks at the start of the game, even when the number of players allows for an even number of auction lots. While I don’t think removing 2 cards or so from the deck for some uncertainty is a bad idea, this is too many for my taste, and I prefer to play with the full deck in these cases.

For Sale seems to have the reputation on BGG as being one of the best fillers ever, and despite my rating perhaps not reflecting it due to my lesser enjoyment of fillers, I think I have to agree. It is extremely bare bones, but it's speed and ease of learning it's hard to get something that can also be so strategic. You really need to watch how other people bid, consider what could possibly come up next, and what money/cards people have left if you want to win.

Comments entered on 02 Apr 2010:

For Sale is an interesting two-phase game. The first phase has players using their limited funds to bid and purchase the "houses" that come up for sale. The second phase has players using their purchased houses to sell for checks which garner the victory points needed to win.

This light game is played frequently because it's fast and easy to teach. It is the game that has been favored the past year or so when I get a chance to get together with Tim, John, and Mike.

Fantastic filler game.  This is the only game in my collection that has gotten immediate replay requests.  Its first appearance at game night saw 7 playings! Can't recommend this one enough.

This is a neat game that changes in the middle.  It goes from an Auction game (one of my favorite mechanics) to a Trick taking game (which I hate) yet I still enjoy this one for a light filler.

RATING: 8
An excellent filler game.  You have a starting amount of money that must last you the whole game.  You bid on properties valued 1 to 30.  And when all auctioned, you then try to sell them for contracts that range from 0 to 15,000 dollars.  It is a very simple game, very family weight in its character.  Simple to teach and play.

RATING: 8.1
Went ok. Needs a few more plays to get the strategy. Some humour in the paying a fortune for a shed thing.

Second play well after the first. Although the mechanics are really simple I think that the first couple of games need to be do it quick don't think about it sort of games. By then you might have some idea what to bid for or not because otherwise it all seems a bit of a mystery to new players.

After numerous plays this game is very good and suitable for light travel play. the money tokens are a bit fiddly - maybe money cards would have been better.

Ridiculously large box and rule book for portability

  The best filler game I have come across yet.  It probably helps that I love auction games, but aside from that it's still pretty perfect for quick game.  You can teach it in ten minutes and play a game in fifteen, but there is still a fair amount of strategy entailed.  Nothing that's gonna paralyze you, but still enough to make it feel worthwhile.

Next time we'll try the "High Society" variant.

After several plays with my son, I've realized that, although he love the cards and coins and pictures of different domiciles, this needs to move to a higher shelf... we are down to about 30 tokens, and it is a miracle that we still have all of the cards.

This is the ultimate filler. Fast and Furious. The game itself is a pure auction game, with two phases. The first phase is a classic sequential auction, when you pass you are out and cannot reenter the that round. The second phase is an auction with blind bidding. Here is where the game shines. This second phase is always funny and surprising.  This is a must have!

One of the better filler games in the market.  It's a game with enough randomness and rules light for anyone to enjoy.  Despite the light nature of the game, it doesn't prevent it from becoming a forgettable experience like other filler disposable games.

Every bid you make in this game has huge consequences towards the end goal.  Every dollar spent, every card acquired, and every currency card you've won is not a decision you can simply ignore.  Every round has just enough tension to be recognized and respected while not being overbearing for the player.

I'd been meaning to try For Sale for years, and I'm so glad I did. This is a perfect filler game: easy to learn and teach, and quick to play, but it has teeth and some meat to it.

The decisions in both rounds are interesting. The small set makes card-counting pretty accessible, and it helps to do so. (I'm average at that -- at best -- and can do just fine with it.) But you also have to read your opponents, assess what's on the table in relation to what's come before, what you're holding, what's still to come, and what might be in the kitty.

I can see why this is a classic.

For Sale is one of my first purchases from game designer Stefan Dorra, Uberplay, and one of my first euro-style card games but, it definitely won't be my last.

RATING: 6.5
This game is better than the rating I gave it. For Sale is a game that does one thing, but it does that one thing well. The reason I have it rated slightly lower than it's potential (probably around an 8 or so) is because the one thing it does well isn't something that piques my interest. I'll still play it regularly, especially if someone asks.

For Sale simply revolves around bidding for things. It's not real-time, so there's nothing crazy going on. In fact, it devolves to some number-crunching for a good majority of the game. So basically, if bidding and medium-level number-crunching sounds like your slice of heaven, this will probably be about an 8 or 9 for you.

Simple, fast and fun. Always a good time.

I now have the fine Star Wars retheme found in the files and images here. I know it's dumb, but it is a lot more fun to bid on Yoda's hut and Echo Base.

RATING: 8
Excellent game! This is likely the most accessible filler I've ever played. Player enjoyment is virtually guaranteed.

Update 4/27/14: Now that I've played this game with 2, 3 and 4, I definitely prefer it with 3. With 4 players, you are bidding against 3 other players. No matter how good you are at reading others, it's impossible to know what they are bidding. Also, the more players you have, the more you have to keep track of (in the way of counting cards). I appreciate that the small amount of strategy that this game has, and by more and more players, I think that strategy is increasingly diluted. Therefore, if you want a more strategic game, play with 2 or 3. If you want a more wild and certainly more random game, play with 4-5. 

BEST WITH 3!

Update 3/19/15: I can explain this game in 90 seconds and there is a good amount to chew on and enjoy. That alone makes it worthwhile in my opinion.

3 / 5 - Good.

This is a fun game but there's something about its stripped-down nature that doesn't quite grab me by the balls. That said it's an invaluable game to have around because it's a simple and very quick multi-player filler. There are very few multi-player games that cram as much fun into so little play time.

RATING: 8
For Sale is perhaps the very best pure auction game of all time.  It's also quite simple.  The game has two phases.  In the first phase players bid on housing properties with their starting money.  In the second phase players bid again, this time for cheques of various values, with the properties won in the first phase.  Whomever has the most money (a combination of cheques and left over starting money) wins the game.

It's that easy.  Children can play this game.  Yet it's such fun to bid and try to outmanoeuvre your opponents.  The artwork on the property cards is fun to look at as well.  Properties range from lowly out-houses, and igloos all the way to castles, and even a space station!  For Sale is maybe the only game I feel confident about saying belongs in everyone's collection.

Very very light filler. Almost brainless gameplay. Ok, that is harsh. There are some decisions making process, but those are neither interesting nor complex. Still, the game is "ok" for a light filler.

Well, this is just a classic auction game. Of course that means that I'm really bad at it 'cos I always struggle to value things correctly in auctions. Nevertheless, I'll play it happily (unless I'm playing with real "sharks" and then it's just a pointless exercise). It's a bit strange in the way that it's a two-part game, but there's a few of those around (such as [gameid=34219]).

Very accessible gateway/gateway+ auction game that definitely plays well with the higher player counts

RATING: 8.5
Fun, light auction game combined with trick taking.

Initially players start out with a pile of cash to spend bidding for different properties which are ranked 1 (the lowest of the houses - like a cardboard box) to 30 (the most impressive space station).  Any money left over is kept to the end of the game and counts towards victory.

Once everyone has their starting hands of property cards, players then simultaneously each play one per turn to try and claim differing cheques which are up for grabs at the same time.  A challenge to figure out whether to play high to get the valuable cheques, play low to burn the less useful properties on one's hand or play mid range and hope to clean up if everyone else has played low.

Great for playing with new players.  What it does it does fantastically well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A game everyone needs to try. Easy to learn, harder to master type of game. A good mix of strategy and luck, as how the cards come out in both phases will push the direction of the round and the game. 

Bidding drafts are fun, I'll be looking for it as a mechanic in other games...

First a round of sequential bidding, then a round of blind simultaneous bidding with the stuff you won from the sequential bidding. Biggest pro is that it plays up to 6. I like how you exchange money for stuff, then that stuff back in for money, trying to make the biggest gains. I can't convince myself I need both this and High Society, and I have High Society.

For a short, light filler game with a lot of luck (on a per hand/round basis, at least), [i]For Sale [/i] involves a number of intriguing decisions.  It also has the highest fun/minute ratio of any game.

During the auction phase, it takes a bit of finesse and forward planning to avoid getting stuck in a situation where you've committed money and end up having to pass and take a crappy card.  Bidding/raising is not as easy as taking the previous bid and adding $1000.  Often choosing another value is much more advantageous.

Players simultaneously select which properly to put on the market during the selling phase, and knowing which to choose is rarely obvious.  It is helpful if you can remember which players own which properties (or at least which have those with the highest values) and how your opponents tend to play.  Will your opponent always throw out a 30 when a $15,000 card appears, or will he greedily bid lower, knowing that you are going to bid low since you "know" that he is going to bid high?

This is probably a more complete bluffing game than Felix. There is a higher risk for staying in the auction and after you have collected your cards there is an additional selling phase.

Edit 11/20/09:  Had to bump this up a notch because the theme is incorporated so well that it practically teaches itself.  It's one of the few games that I've played successfully with a group ranging in age from 8 to 82.

Even it was a solitaire game for 3 players, I was hooked into this game straightaway and made me laugh at the end of the game. This is a brilliant game. I love the sense of humor on the property cards. I love the bidding mechanic in this game which adds a fair amount of strategic decision problem to what it looks like a simple light weight game. I love to play this more and I see there will be tons of plays from this.

This one is quite good, I see how it and Biblios sort of cover the same thing only with less or more players (this one with more). For me, it's a bit too short for me to invest myself in the outcome, but it's pleasant to play. You really try to nail the value of each card so that it hits the sweet spot - and then in the second phase you really try to nail down what everyone else is thinking - a futile exercise, but you can be "good" at it - at least compared to the rest of the group that's playing.

Anyway, I like it, and it's fine, and I can play it once or twice, or I can just play a longer more substantial game - or something of this length (Carcassonne maybe, though that's a bit longer) where I feel a bit more investment?

A fine game.

Game in a Nutshell: Use some money to bid on different valued properties in an auction. Then, in a blind bid, sell your properties for checks while trying to turn the biggest profit.

Played as: 4,5,6 player

Pros: I read for a long time this was a quintessential filler and now that I’ve played, I have to agree. Easy but satisfying. The two phases compliment each other well-- the first being a more tactical auction with interesting consequences for staying in or passing, followed by a simultaneous blind bid in the second round which leaves room for players to get in each others heads a bit. I love the Uberplay artwork (also carried into the Gryphon ed.) which keeps it light and unintimidating. It’s the kind of auction game anyone could like.

Cons: There’s a certain luck element as to turn order in the first round auctions that restricts your control of your options (more present the more players you have). There’s also a possibility that one bad decision can affect you in the long run like running out of money in the first round or playing a key property at the wrong time in the second essentially devaluing the rest of your hand by proxy. Kind of overpriced for what you get in the box.

Other:  I would have made this an automatic buy if wasn’t currently so stinking overpriced. Maybe the game-play makes it worth what they’re asking, but the component mass certainly doesn’t.  That just bothers me.

Best Use: In case you didn’t already know, a fantastic 20 minute filler.

Me gustó mucho. Me parece un juego de relleno casi perfecto para intercalarlo en sesiones con juegos más sesudos o que requieran más tiempo. Sencillo, partidas rápidas y con bastante interacción. El hecho de que el juego tenga 2 partes bien diferenciadas lo hace más interesante y a la vez, algo más táctico. Lo mejor es que permite un buen número de jugadores y es bastante divertido y ameno. Lo peor es que es un juego que puede cansar rápidamente. No creo que se puedan echar más de 3 o 4 partidas seguidas sin que uno empiece a aburrirse. Lo cual no es del todo malo porque... tenemos aún muchos más juegos!!

Simple, fun, bidding game. Easy to explain and plays in 15 minutes. Bid for real estate and then use your real state in the second round to bid for checks. Use some psychology to guess which cards your opponent will play in the second round. Very enjoyable for non-gamers. Gamers tend to consider this more of a warm up game or time filler.

RATING: 9.5
Easy enough for anyone to learn in 3 minutes and be competitive in their very first game, strategic enough so that better players are rewarded by winning more often. Many decisions in a single game (which lasts around 15 minutes) and so much fun. Almost impossible to play just one game. I don't see me ever getting bored with this game.

RATING: 6
This is a quick and simple game of trading properties. The game is played in two phases, in the first phase players bid on properties revealed on the table, choosing either to up the current bid or to pass and withdraw half their bid (if any) rounded up and take the lowest valued property currently on the table. This continues until the property deck is depleted, and then in the second phase players play their properties secretly in order to win the most money possible, determined by the money cards revealed on the table. The higher valued property you play compared to your opponents the higher valued money card you win this round. Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins the game.

This is a fun little game all about figuring out your opponents moves and adjusting your own accordingly.

The casual gamers I've introduced this to have all gone nuts over it. It also plays up to six. I'm kinda sick of it, but that just goes to show how popular it is amongst my casual gamer friends. The first few times I played, I loved the crap out of it. Now when I play, it feels like I just never have enough control over my fate in the game... I don't know, it just doesn't feel strategic enough to me. Granted, it is filler... pretty much the best filler I know for a large group of non-gamers.

One of the best quick filler games.  I played this game over and over again for about three hours with a group of very serious gamers.   Of the five players, only two consistently won.  After changing seating order, other players started winning.  Our conclusion was that your chances of winning may have as much to do with the bidding strategies of the players seated next to you.  That said, this game still gives you the illusion of rewarding the player with the best bidding strategy.

RATING: 7
An excellent auction game where play goes around and players bid on property cards using a set bankroll. If they pass on a bid, they take the next lowest value property on the market, but they get half their current bid back. The winner gets the highest value property on the market, but pays their entire bid. The second half of the game has players selling their properties to attain the highest value "cheque" cards. Cheques and leftover money is tallied at the end, and whoever has the most wins. It's a neat double auction where winnings from the first half are used to bet on the points in the second half. The real key seems to be judging how aggressive to be when spending your money.

RATING: 5
Ultra-light filler. High Society or Coloretto are much better at filling the niche of "the light yet interestimg game that gamers play between their main games". Best left for play with non-gamers and young kids.
The first edition english rules are confusing, which is surprising for what should be a very simple game. The errata posted here on BGG is required reading, especially on how the first round of bidding works.

The best thing about this game is being able to compete to get the best pet in each round.

Great light filler game.  Easy and fast, but with just enough depth that you want to play it again.  If only it wasn't an auction game.  This is definately my favorite auction game.

Great fun - simple concept with a fair amount of interaction across two phases of play.  Can you resist the temptation of getting drawn into a bidding war, but know when to go all out for that first or second card?  How strong is your nerve?  Do you know a good deal when you see it?  Excellent.

Yes, it's easy to teach. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it involves a super fast-paced gameplay. Yes, everybody likes it. 

But the box. What a pain. I have to costantly watch out not to loose one of that small coins! 

Fun game that asks to be played multiple times in a row, but I can not do that too often, I feel a high-risk of getting nauseated by it.

Becoming one of my favorite Fillers.  It's quick and smooth.  I love the selling phase where you really have to make some tough choice based on what money is available.  The bidding is good, not great, but it's fun to see people squirm on if they should raise the bid or not.

A neat game with a pretty straight forward auction. I'm not normally a fan of vanilla auctions like this one, but this game is so quick and painless that it makes for a great filler. Unfortunately, after awhile it starts to feel a tad redundant. I think I'd rather opt for Medici for a similar feel.

RATING: 7
For Sale is a very easy to learn and very quick playing filler in the same category as High Society, No Thanks! and Loco. They are all fast playing, light on rules and all pack a deceptive level of tricky decision making into a small and very efficient package. 

Bidding too high or too low in the 1st stage can hurt as much as not having the good cards to obtain cash in the 2nd stage. The game really is about balance and picking your spots carefully to get the best value possible for your limited assets. Our first 3 player game of this ended 75,000-72,000-68,000. A close contest and one that made me a quick fan of the game.

An easy choice to get to the table when waiting for people to arrive for a longer and more complicated game.

For Sale is the finest filler game that I've played.  In only fifteen minutes, it includes a lot of important decisions and some interesting tactics.  I like how the two phases work so well with each other, and how high valued houses aren't necessarily the best.  It's all about selling your houses for more than you bought them more than selling high valued houses.

The first phase can become a little rote at times, as in my group the bids almost always go 1, 3, 5, 7, pass.  Since bidding an odd number is in all ways better than an even, it's almost as if you are bidding at levels.  But depending on the houses themselves, it can be advantageous to switch up the bidding slightly.  As a result, if I have only fifteen minutes, I don't think there's another game that I'd rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.4
The best economic filler because of great decisions in a short time.  Auction phase to buy houses is followed by selling them off for money with simultaneous selection.

Good. Nice auction game. Not as good as RA, but I really liked. The two auction phases are linked elegantly, and it's so simple to teach, that anyone (even non-gamers) can learn it. Amazing gateway game, and even if it's not the greatest game I've played, it deserves an honorable mention ;)

Got this as a quick to learn, quick to play game for my daughters (9 and 12) and me.  Fits that bill supremely well as we can rattle off a game in 10 - 15 minutes.  Actually, that is what I like most about this game -- the speed at which a complete start-to-finish can take place AND the game manages to do this with a cute story arc thrown in.  It's like a game of spit but with a tangible story of buying low and selling high.  After one game my 12 y.o. was cackling over selling the dog house for $11 K and bemoaning the sale of a mansion for $3 K.  My younger daughter was more interested in collecting her favorite houses...and this strategy has won the majority of our games so far!

Edit: -1 because its half-life was very, very short.  For whatever reason I'd rather play a game of cards than this game.

Enjoyable little filler game. I love the illustrations, though they do get a little old/lose their flair after a few plays. I like bidding so this was a neat little game, but I sometimes wonder if it'd be better with more meat. Then again, its meant to be a short, filler game.

Its been a miss with at least one of my friends, but pretty much all the others liked it, though no one was "wowed" by it. I guess I kinda wish this game could do that :/

P.S. The box is a bit obnoxious - they could've reduced it to half the size (I'd probably bump this 0.5 if it was the size of Love Letter's red bag for example), though I dunno if the art on it would've suffered as a result.

Plays: 10+

EDIT: Someone pointed out in the forums that For Sale can be used to play a variant of No Thanks! a filler of a similar level, so I appreciate that. Overall For Sale has gotten a little stale for me, but I think playing different games with this set can be fun (like No Thanks or Kobayakawa). I also do like the pretty pictures and the theme more than the pictures on the other games (BTW, this is the only board game other than chess that I played my mother in) so I really appreciate it.

Trading because its just okay. It doesnt get me in the mood too often and hasn't really blown away anyone I've shown it too. I like auctions and the art, but I think I'd prefer Ra or Dream Factory for a bit more depth in my auctions beyond just the pretty art.

Based on one play I'm not sure what the big deal is.  Yes it's simple.  Yes it's clever.  But it just doesn't grab me.  I'm not a fan of blind bidding, so that hurts the ratings.  It's saving grace is that it is quite quick to play.

A simplistic filler game about flipping houses that is capitalist to the core: Buy Cheap, Sell Dear.

Better than other popular fillers Incan Gold and No Thanks! simply because there are more phases to the game and decisions to be made. All-in-all though, I think I want more out of my games than any of the fore-mentioned have to offer. There is just not enough 'game' to them.

Can't figure out why my wife doesn't rate this game as highly as I do. Also, I've found over time that it's better to teach this game backwards. When I've started by showing players what happens in the second phase, they have a much easier time understanding what their trying to accomplish in the first phase. I realize that I've just made the rules sound complicated. Nothing could be further from the truth. This game is so simple. But many folks just don't enjoy the anxiety of making choices for which they don't fully understand the potential ramifications. Anyway, this is a great game that I think belongs in every collection.

Fun little filler. I haven't quite figured out any strategy to it yet, though. My 7 YO and my wife have both beaten me twice, and they aren't very good at strategy games. It does, however, create some agonizing decisions, which is generally all I ask for in a game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This has become one of my families favorite fillers especially as an opener for family game night. In reality this game has stood the test of time for 18 years, I still haven't played a similar game that I've enjoyed more (Biblios comes to mind and in my opinion isn't nearly as good).

I can't recommend this game enough, it's been a hit with gamers, my family and our extended family and friends.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Easy to teach, you can teach as you play (only explaining one phase at a time).
- I can see this becoming a staple when beginning or ending a game night.
- A great family game that can be a great first step in learning bidding/auction games.
- Awesome week night filler, we can get a 4p game in under 20 minutes.[/i]

I didn't find the theme (buying real estate) or the art work very appealing.

I would probably enjoy it more next time around, now that I understand how to play, but would just rather play something else. (3 + 2)

This is a good filler, and quite a brain burner- as fillers go. There are a LOT of decisions to be made in this game and every one can be critical, so after playing it you feel you've had the experience of playing a full blown 1 hour family Euro

There are plenty of big box games (particularly Ameritrash) that overall, end-to-end, have fewer decisions to make and are  less interesting than what you get packed in to 15 minutes of  For Sale.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
50+ plays. A high quality 15 minute opener that always proves enjoyable. 

The game leads off with 4-6 auctions depending on number of players. The auction feel is different from other games due to the matching mechanism, so it's not so much a question of raise or not, but more one of if I match, how likely is it that other people will bail out - and am I happy paying full price if everyone else bails out and gets half their money back. So the auction moves gradually up from auto-match to decision time. 

The second half provides a simultaneous play aspect to turn the houses bought in the first halve into cash. Again, because it's only 4-6 rounds, there's a fun denouement feel which is perfect in length. 

The game remains a solid winner for us.

"Great auction filler. Simple to teach, quick to play, and no pvp attacks."

Two-part filler. First, open auction for houses. Then, secret bid auction to sell those houses for the biggest checks. Nothing too exciting, but ok, and doable for casual gamers. 

3-6p, with well-regarded 2p variants available.

Maybe the greatest filler game available? It plays quick, is extremely easy to teach, and people always want "one more game".

I think the mechanics are sort of genius and the two phases are very interesting while also being open ended enough so that anyone has a chance. If the first phase doesn't go your way, you can hope for weird cards in the second phase and come out on top.

I love this game.

I bought biblios instead of this one, 2 years ago. It seamed borring to me and i wouldn't have given it a chance if it wasn't for the irresistable Iello edition. 

I found out I enjoyed the game a lot, so did everyone I played it with. It goes on real fast and no one seams to get bored. In sessions when we play more than one games, For Sale gets to be played multiple times. 

I still prefer Biblios, but everybody asks for For Sale.

I also had great sucess with kids (ages 8-12). They loved the way they used their money, they all got their favorite houses and everybody laughed at whoever got stuck with the cardboard house and the toilet. They shouted and begged me not to stop playing. 

(Wife's Point of View: not thriled but won't say no and that is precious)

Great little auction game that starts with sequential bidding and ends with blind bidding.  Usually I don't like blind bidding much, but didn't mind too much here (possibly because of the short game length).

The quintessential filler game.  It's quick to pickup and play.  I found most gamer and non-gamer groups approve of this game and have fun.  Definitely some tension trying to figure out how people are going to bid or when they're going to sell their property in the second phase.

I don't like how the bidding is conducted with the "losing half" your bid, rounded down.  It causes a lot of games with odd bids.

Incredibly simple idea, but great fun for all types of gamers.

RATING: 8
For Sale is a marvelous achievement in game design. The double auction mechanism is simple and intriguing and satisfies both a short term and long term satisfaction itch in any gamer.
 
A typical game will have 5-7 rounds in each of two phases. In the short term, you get the thrill of winning or the agony of defeat over 10-14 hands. In the long term, you get to see if you can master value investing, buy low/sell high compared to your fellow gamers.

This game is inexpensive, accessible for children, quick to set-up, quick to play, with an element of mind games and memory. I find that my eldest son and I play against the player, as in poker, moreso than just the current hand, which adds depth.

My favorite part is trying to play a poor hand well. The only possible criticism is that due to the auction order some first phase hands are just not worth pursuing if you are one of the last two players to submit a bid. This forces a player to learn how to play weak cards well.

That said, I find the blind-bidding in the second half of the game, in particular, to be a really interesting and unique challenge. Not something I want to play all the time, but I'll pull this out frequently for a quick game or with my family.

Light and quick filler. Good introduction to auction games. 

The simple rules and theme/rule transparency makes for a good family game.

Component comment: In this case I'd actually have prefered non-descript plastic money discs instead of cardboard coins due to the fact that you keep them concealed in your sweaty paws all through the game.

Great filler game. Love the cards but the box is way too big. I played this again with some friends and it kind of fell flat. I tried the Tom Vasel way of explaining just the first stage of the game and everyone complained that I didn't tell them the whole strategy.

Not my style of game, really. I can see the appeal and that's why it's in my collection.

Very cute little filler game. Played in two phases: In the first, you make bids to purchase houses and in the second, you sell the houses, hopefully to collect the most money. Great artwork on the house cards make it all the more fun.

We've played a two-player variant with a dummy third hand -- that collects the house card with the middle value during phase one. During phase two, the house cards are pulled randomly, taking whatever income card that earns out of the game. Worked great and we had fun playing.

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per 
play

I finally get to play this "king of filler" game at my local meetup! Since it rated 7.6 on my geekbuddy score I was expecting more for this game. The game turned out to be ok. One reason could be because we played 3-players. I suspect it will play better with more but since I have so many filler card games that I feel owning this will be redundant. However, if I didn't have those card filler games this one is definitely a keeper.

---- Update ----
With 2 games of 4-player under my belt, I honestly think this game plays the same with 3 or 4 players. I will see if 5+ players will make this game shine.

No interesting or hard decisions. 

A light filler game. Very abstract game play. Over the course of the game, players will make about dozen decisions -- and they're typically binary: bid or pass. So there isn't a lot here in terms of game, and it's certainly quite random, in virtue of how the cards come out.

My favorite multi-player filler. Always up for a quick game or two between longer games. Note: My rating went down after playing with the Uberplay rules. Since it expands the game to 6 players, this version will probably hit the table more often but it is not quite as elegant as the original. Further note: I have decided to split the differnce between the 6 I give the new version and the 9 I give the old version. Since the new version can be played with the old rules, I will almost always be playing the version I like better. However, people playing for the first time with the new rules might be left wondering what the fuss was about this game. They are not bad, but are just nothing special like the original version.

Fantastic little game that is ridiculously easy to learn and very quick to play.  All of my games have been 3 player but I'll bet it plays equally well, if not better, with a full compliment of players.

Great production, small box format, rulebook - clear, concise, to the point.  You can learn how to play in 5 minutes from the book before even opening up the cards.  (well, I did anyways)

Once you do, you'll find a colourful, enjoyable bidding game played in two distinct rounds.  The first - buying properties - where players purchase the face-up properties in a clockwise auction setting until one player passes and then s/he takes the lowest value card.  The round continues until all players either outbid or pass, leaving this highest-paying player the highest valued card on the table.

The second round involves selling the properties that have been won - against a new deck of 'value' cards.  These cards are laid out, and each player secretly chooses a property from those s/he has won the round previously, and the highest card played takes the highest valued cheque card.  At the end, whoever has the most money wins.

Beauty!  Simple!  Clever.  Most of this will be played for sure, excellent value within.

A strong filler that's one of the easier games I've played (of the Euro persuasion).  There is a pretty decent amount of strategy that goes into the game, it's important that you try to keep things light while playing.  Players may fall prey to the desire to count cards, and if one player is doing it, they can have a pretty strong advantage.  Probably two ways to play:  fast and light, or long and counting.  Either way each hand won't take over 25 minutes.

For Sale, No Thanks! and Category 5 form the Holy Trinity of easy fillers you can play with anyone, any time. Of the three, For Sale is the least abstract, with cards with cool pictures and tokens with money values. Recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The mechanics of the bidding used to buy batches of houses in the first round is interesting and tense, due to current value assessment and what MAY be in the next batch. The skill increases as you need to remember who purchased what when it comes to trading the houses for the checks, but the check batches can undermine all the thought involved. I also find the summing up alittle cumbersome, so not the best filler for me. Why is High Society mentioned in the same breath as For Sale, when the only similarity is highest bid wins a positive value; two completely different designs in my mind (High Society is marginally better :)).

This is a quick filler card game composed of two phases of auctions involving real estate trades. In the first phase, round cardboard tokens are used as money for the auction. The auction is a standard open auction going around clockwise till all but one player drop out. You can easily run out of coins, so don't go overboard bidding!

In the second phase, cards (representing checks) are used for auction. The cards each has a unique number on it and are used for the second round auction. This time blind auction is used in which players simultaenously play a card as their bid.

Easy to teach and quick to play, but still has some Subtleties in when to bid or drop out of the auction and also a little bit of keeping track of what cards other players have already played.
Very good as a filler.

Ingatlanügynökök vagyunk, akik a játék első fázisában ingatlanokat vesznek a lehető legkevesebb pénzért, majd az ingatlanokat próbálják a legnagyobb profittal eladni.
Hogy néz ez ki?
Van 2x30 kártya, az első fázisban kiborítunk annyi lapot, ahányan vagyunk, majd a sorszámozott ingatlanokra licitálunk. Aki először kiszáll, az a megkapja az addigi licitjének a feléért (felfelé kerekítve) a legkisebbet, majd megy tovább a licit addig, amíg már csak ketten maradnak, akkor is elveszi félpénzért az utolsó előtti a második legnagyobb kártyát, míg az utolsónak be kell fizetnie az összeset a bankba a legjobb ingatlanért.
A második fázisban nem pénzzel, hanem az ingatlanjainkkal fizetünk a felborított csekkekért. Az nyer, akinek a csekkjei a legtöbbet érnek.
Hiába tűnik egyszerűnek, minden parti más és más és keményen lehet taktikázni is a legjobb lapokért!

A great, distilled auction game. I love that the rules are so simple that I can teach them to almost anyone very quickly, but they still give you a lot to think about as you play. There's enough skill that your decisions clearly matter, but enough luck that you don't feel terrible when things don't go your way. I like how the two phases (buying properties and selling properties) work together while still being rather different. It's also nice that it plays so quickly and has a decently large player count range.

Simple, short and quick auction game. It's basically a game of chicken to see who is willing to stay in the longest and get the best property at the expense of paying full cost. The checks phase of the game also contains subtle strategy to outplay your opponents. One issue that I found was that it usually better to bet in increments of $2k. Since you keep half of your bet rounded down if you bow out, betting $1k and $2k yields the same cost unless you win the best property.

This is treated as something of a classic, and it's pretty easy to see why (although I guess the game has seen some small rules tweaks over the years as far as how the first-phase auction works). The first half of the game you acquire properties via an auction, and in the second half you sell those for money based on available money cards that everyone is simultaneously blind-bidding on with their property cards. Most money wins. Boom, done. It's easy to teach, easy to grasp, quick to play, and is clearly a top tier short game.

a fast-playing bidding + bluffing game, it should come with $500 coins and allow bidding in increments of $1000 to solve the "how do I split $7000 in half" issue.  I've played it a few times and it hasn't gotten very exciting.

This was the first auction-type game I ever played. It's very easy to learn and teach to a group of friends. It's one of those games that is a staple in my collection even though it's really simple to play and would be unlikely I'd ever trade the game.

RATING: 7
Awesome filler.  A great push your luck/bluffing/bidding game that lasts 10 to 20 minutes.

The game is composed of two rounds.  In the first players bid sequentially on houses.  There are 30 numbered from 1 to 30.  The first player to pass takes the lowest valued house and pays half their bid and so on until only one player is left.  That player has to pay their entire bid for the highest card.

In the second round, check cards are revealed and players bid the houses acquired in the the first half of the game on the checks.  Houses are bid face down and revealed once all have bid.  Checks are worth $0 to $15,000.

The randomness of what cards come out together combined with attempts to outguess your opponents makes for a great filler game.  It's not quite as good as Liar's Dice.

I printed out the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/50711/item/1165791#item1165791]Star Wars homemade version[/url] - got one play in - looks like a very good filler.
Got another play in, and the score is rising (from 8 to 8.75, to 9). 
Lots of gameplay value for little rules or time cost.

After playing over 20 times, this really is one of the best filler games out there, for quickness/ease/depth of gameplay.  Ages above 8 recommended to understand strategy.
It may rate highest on my "decisions per minute" casual filler list.

Played twice, with 6 players, and it went by VERY fast.  I think it's way too simple and way too fast (at least with that many players), with way too few interesting decisions to make, to be much fun.  There's not enough time to develop any strategy, or to do anything to make the game interesting.  I might play it again, but not if there's something else to try first.

great filler. quick elegant game with a really nice physiological aspect to the bidding. i think people who complain about blind bidding are no good at reading people or bluffing and don't understand them as game mechanics (or, i guess, just don't like mechanics that require social skills). i for one have the social skills of a leprous amoeba, but have great fun when playing this game. one of those games you want to play "one more time," over and over again.

I wish my Uberplay edition wasn't so overproduced. I mean, the box and cards are good quality, but the box is ridiculously large for what it actually contains.

I am very bad at using resources effectively in auction games.  For Sale is another one of those games where I spend a lot of the game laughing at myself. I overpay, I underbid, I give up too quickly on the good stuff.  This is all part of the fun.  It's part of what makes For Sale amusing.  For Sale is also incredibly simple, easy to learn and can accommodate large groups so there are a lot of situations where For Sale would be a great game to play.  Laughing at myself is fun for the first bit of the game, and then it starts to get less fun.  There are other fillers that I'd much rather play than this one.

Great card game of bidding for a range of valued property cards to obtain the best hand. 
Then, in the second half of the game, convert that hand by selling the properties for the best value cheques.
Great choices of when to bid or when to back down & save your money for later property. Then, which ones to play for the cash conversion.
Great fun.

It's there among the best fillers with 6nimmt! Quick but very satisfying...

Edit (10.06.2017): Yesterday after Pandemic Legacy we played a quick round of this! I reminded me what a wunderful game this really is. In a 20-30 minutes time-frame it presents lighthearted but still tough decisions, and the tabletalk which occurs always during this game is fantastic. I can't imagine anybody who wouldn't enjoy this. 
But this highlight also my problem with the rating system on BGG. For what it is, it definately deserves a 10, but I cannot put it onto the same level as Great Western Trail, Mombasa or Le Havre. We are mostly into medium-heavy euros, but still I highly appreciate this game for what it gives to this hobby: one of the most accessible and best filler you can own.

Can't decide which I like more: this or No Thanks

RATING: 8
Wow! Sometimes I avoid simpler games like these because I don't see how something so casual can live up to the hype. For Sale exceeded my expectations by a long shot. It's casual and simple, for sure, but these are some of it's greatest strengths. In 30 minutes I learned the rules, taught it to two other players and played two full games. It's light on strategy, but there's enough here that two players could approach the game completely different and have a shot at winning. You will occasionally get the lucky draw and score a high card with your weak property, but smart card play rules overall. I dub this a new favorite filler game.

This game is simply fun.  

It's repetative and folks can grow tired of it but after really, a ton of plays (way more then I keep up with) it's still fun.

You first have to buy real estate cards by using a small allotment of coins you are given at the beginning via an auction mechanism with the other players and then once you have all your real estate cards, you use them to acquire the best sale price cards which are monetary denomination cards that at the end of the game will be tallied to determine the winner.

It's really quick and fairly simple but when you need such a thing it can be taught in a matter of minutes and most folks find it intuitive once they start.  Really a fun game.

For Sale is a pure auction game. First you auction properties for money, then you auction cheques (worth money) for properties. At the end the person with the most money wins. The second auction is fairly obvious, you bid high when the distribution of cheque values is large, but the first auction is difficult - do you bid for high absolute values (26-30), when the spread is large, or for position (I want to be second in the bidding frequently)?

for a 10-minute game, it's got:  trash talk, bidding, drama, analysis, press your luck, tension.  i've never played another game like it.

It's like working an 8-hr day as a stock analyst, and then later that night going to Atlantic City and blowing what you earned.

RATING: 8.4
Great fun game. Plays fast, has very cool game play. The bidding and selling can be tricky depending on what is up.
We enjoy this game and get four games in an hour. Goes well with both young and old. Give it a try, you might be surprised.

After many plays, this still is a winner for me. I enjoy it and usually play two games back to back.

RATING: 8
A lesson in doing more with less. It's a bit of an exercise in gaming the players, per se, as multiple rounds of For Sale can give you an idea of who plays risky and who does not (or rather, assess the tendecies players WISH to convey), and so there is a bit of metagaming aspect to this. I like the interaction, I appreciate the quick play time, and I enjoy the opportunity for subverting high bids with cleverly timed and very profitable low bids.

One of my absolute favorite fillers. It's like two games in one. Extremely quick playing, plenty of tough choices, multiple auction styles, intuitive to play, easy to explain and the art on the various properties is fun and suits the theme of the game perfectly. Very satisfying experience from such a quick game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays very quickly.  Easy to teach, even to non-gamers.  Game mechanic is a couple of auctions - first money for houses then play houses for checks (money).  Winner is the player with the most money at the end.  Not as involved auction-wise as say Modern Art and a bit easier for non-gamers to understand compared to say High Society make this a highly recommended game in any collection.  The short playing time just adds to this game's appeal.

Is there a better filler game? This was brought to one of our game nights and I saw it was played in 15 minutes, so I figured that it had to be boring and random like fluxx. Well there is a bit of a randomness to it, but it has one of my favorite mechanics ever for a game... bidding. I loved it.

Ok light filler if you enjoy auctions - I prefer auctions that are more structured like Vegas Showdown.  I haven't played High Society, but it seems like that one is better for the same niche, since your bids are limited to the cards you have in hand.

One of the easiest games to teach since you can safely teach the phases separately. Plays quickly and the losing players almost always ask for a rematch. Works best with higher player counts though works well from 3-6. Those factors just make it an easy game to pull out in groups of non-gamers. A bit too light for me personally though.

Egyszerűnek tűnő, de ugyanakkor az embert nehéz döntések elé állító játékról van szó. Vegyek, vagy ne? Hogyan osszam be a pénzemet? stb.
Warm up játéknak nagyon jó, mert gyorsan, könnyedén lehet vele hangulatot teremteni.
Mivel pénzek nem készültek hozzá, ezért 11,5g-os kerámia pókerzsetonokat használunk hozzá, ami még egy kicsit ad a játékélményhez (ha már licit...).

Fantastic filler.  My only complaint is that, in the bidding portion of the game, once the first person drops out and takes the lowest card, it almost always makes sense for all other players to immediately drop out as well.  That makes the bidding less interesting, and is the only reason I don't rate this a "9."  Nevertheless, this one gives you a tremendous fun-per-minute value.

Combines open auction bidding with blind bidding. Supports six players, which is nice. The bid-raise auction takes a while to get used to, because it's difficult to know what to bid (especially with random cards removed from the deck), but with the right group  the blind-bidding phase at the end is instantly fun and has everyone laughing and animated. Interestingly, some groups seem to prefer the property auction to the blind bidding. 

A decent filler, but it won't change your life or anything. Strangely compelling nonetheless... must play one more game...

Update: Played a couple more games and my group (of overly analytical types) still liked it less than I did, so I traded it.

Update the second: Of course, as soon as they found out that I'd traded it they had a change of heart and keep asking for it. Grrrr.

This is a really quick and interesting game for the whole family.  The first half of the game has houses of varying quality from 1?-30ish that players bid on to buy.  Then, the next half, you will try to play the highest card in each round to win the highest offer out on the table.  That's all there is to it, and it is very well done.

Maybe the best of the fillers, and I think it's particularly fun with the max number of players.

RATING: 7.5
Good filler. Easy to learn. Strategy and bluffing opportunities. And fast! The game plays in two stages. Everyone gets some money to start. In the first stage, players go through several rounds bidding off the entire real estate deck (each round you put out N cards, where N is the number of players in the game). Real estate cards are valued from 1 through 30. In a round, you can either bid or pass; if you pass, you claim the lowest value card and take back half of your bid (if any, round up). When everyone but one has passed in the round, the remaining player wins the remaining (high) card at full price. Once all the real estate cards are distributed, the game enters stage two. The players go through several rounds bidding on check cards, like you did in round one, but you bid using the real estate cards and all bids are secret -- in other words, each player picks a real estate card and plays it face down, then all players reveal. The highest valued real estate card gets the highest valued check, and so on. Checks are valued from 0 to $15,000. This round goes even faster than the first. At the end, add up your checks and your cash to see who the winner is. I have to play a few more times to see if there's as much strategy to this game as it seems for such a little package. Fun. Thematically the game is a little dry, you're basically using numbers to bid on numbers, then using those numbers to bid on other numbers ...

RATING: 3
15-minute filler that rewards memory and deduction of what people will do. The auction system is a little finicky and just sufficiently weird enough to confuse non-gamers. Debating between this and It's Alive! to teach as a gateway auction game. The support for 6 players elevates this above other fillers like No Thanks!.

Somewhat obsolete now that I've discovered Turn the Tide.

2012 early Christmas gift for Julia from Zack

The most-non-gamer friendly filler we have ever played.  It is so much fun that people ask to play it again after the first game.  It has a great mix of bidding, bluffing, and press your luck rolled into a neat whimsical real estate theme with locales as varied as a cardboard box to a space station.  I recommend this portable interactive filler game for family gatherings or coffee shop game nights.

For Sale -- Played four-, five-, and six-player. The mechanic used for selling houses feels reminiscent of Raj, however For Sale replaces the elegant balance of Raj with the fun of an auction to determine which houses each player may sell. I slightly prefer this over High Society, but they're both fun fillers.

RATING: 7
Quick little card game based around buying low and selling high.  Mechanics are very simple and the rules are really easy to understand.  Luck can play quite a big factor as once the high bidder is determined, seating arrangement determines the rest of the property distribution.  But, a good player can make that work to their advantage I guess.

My go-to game when I want to bring out a card game filler. Quick to teach as rules are intuitive and the concept should be familiar to most people. Sometimes mediocre purchases can lead to big payouts, and there often will be difficult decisions to be made.

The game's sweet spot for me is with 4 players as they are less predictable since there are 2 missing properties and checks. Auctions tend to become chaotic with 5 or more players.

RATING: 8
[10 plays] This is a clever, very quick, and fun little game that is primarily an exercise in auction psychology. I am impressed with how much fun this delivers in a play time of 10-15 minutes. Maybe better than High Society in terms of teachability and simplicity of rules.

Most recent play 7-28-07 with Garrett, Alex, Pam, and Meridith.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very quick and playable filler. The game is split into two auctions: the first part has players bidding with money for buildings valued 1 to 30. The second auction segment has players using the buildings to blind bid for cheques. The player with the highest amount of money from cheques and currency wins.

The first part has elements of High Society and players should know when to bid high or when to pull out. The blind bidding part is about bluffing and very intense.

Good quick fun and an alternative to High Society.

RATING: 6
"For Sale" is a really great game for non-gamers and gamers alike. It's super easy to understand, teach, and play. However, 3-6 players are needed to play the game. I've had this game in my collection for awhile now and really enjoy it (even though I don't typically win at it), but outside of my gaming group, it's just me and my wife. The gaming group has a lot of filler games that we rotate through, so "For Sale" doesn't see a lot of table time. On top of that, games requiring 3 or more players can't be played with it just me and my wife. Imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon a solo variant for the "For Sale" game! It's called "[b][url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/556146/for-solitaire]For $olitaire[/url][/b]" (by kvenosdel) and it actually works extremely well. I've yet to beat "Jessica" (the imaginary AI player), but that doesn't mean that I'll quite trying. So, if you have "For Sale" sitting around and wish you could play it more, now you can. I highly recommend the solo variant. Have fun!

 Perfect to introduce new people to the hobby, although it's so easy they won't really form an accurate idea.

 Offers a nice challenge concerning how you will handle your resources in both phases- how to invest money in the beginning and how to cash out your investments in the end. You need to guess how your opponents will move and spend little as possible to claim greater benefits as possible.

Initial thoughts after 4P game

The Good: Easy to learn. Quick. Nice artwork.

The Bad: Too expensive for what you get. Not too sure on whether it's worth even trying to bid, and just take $18 plus whatever cheques I can pick into the final scoring!... 

UPDATE: Had another 4P game, and everyone straight away questioned the point of bidding. We tried this for a couple of rounds, but there was no game to be played. So in the spirit of the rules, we restarted and bid as normal... and actually wasn't that bad.

The first half is much better than the second half so it's a bit of an anticlimax.  I can live with the blind bidding, but I could do without the memory aspect.

Auction. Great auction filler, I think I like it a little better than High Society, my previous favorite auction filler. The blind bidding portion adds a nice element of bluffing/outguessing.

RATING: 6
I think this is going to be a solid filler for years to come. If you aren't sure what a good "filler" game should be, play this to find out. For Sale is fun, quick, light, and contains both tactical and strategic decision-making - and an element of trying to second guess other players' choices. This game is never going to be the "event" around which a game night is organized, but its an outstanding starter/filler. The thing about "filler" games is, they may see table time only very infrequently. But I think we'll keep this one - our single "go-to" filler game.

In the first half of the game, players bid up properties in an effort to get the highest value plots at the lowest possible price. In the second half, players participate in a blind bid to secure the most money for their properties. I look forward to playing more of this.

Perfect for what it is - a filler that scales well.  The game play is fast and fun.  It is easy to teach.  The art is vibrant and humorous.  

A lot of fun is packed into this tiny box.  Much more engrossing than a casual perusal of the rules would lead you to believe.

This one gets a "9" because it's almost impossible to refuse a game, it is a great "gateway" game,  I can play with children or adults, it is ultraportable, AND inexpensive.  WOW!

Az egyik legjobb átvezető játék 5-6 játékos számára. Kevesebben is játszható, de szerintem 5-6 játékos estén a legizgalmasabb. Különböző értékű ingatlanokat vásárolunk az első körben licitálással, majd a másodikban minél jobb áron próbáljuk eladni. Nagyon egyszerű 5 perc alatt elmondható szabály, amit kisebbek is könnyen megértenek.
8->7

[2011-06-19]
Kicsit talán tényleg gyengébben működik négyen, de visszateszem a pontszámot 8-ra, mert igazából az egyik legjobb átvezető játéknak tartom.

[2011-09-06]
Megérdemli a 8 pontot ez egyértelmű. 6-an a legjobb, ez nem vitás, de 4-en például nagyobb eséllyel vannak jó körök az eladási részen, emiatt kicsit más a jó stratégia kevesebb játékosszám mellett.

I usually love tricky and witty filler games, but this one just didn't click with me. The two phases of the game felt disjointed and in jarring contradiction with each other. Got rid of this after a few tries. "High Society" is just so much better as a filler auction game, it made no sense to keep the inferior "For Sale" around.

Simple and elegant.  Quite possibly as good as Thor and tying in my book as the best filler card game.  In fact, while it may not be a better game than Thor, I'd say that it beats it out in the "Fun" category.  I've played both versions of For Sale and find that the Uberplay version works just fine.     Beautiful art, nice price point, good job guys.  UPDATE: Aw Crap, I just can't deny it.  This one is a 10.  A perfect filler.

I like For Sale as a auction and  blind bidding game.  I like the two-tiered approach to the game, with the first auction of properties, followed by the re-sale of the property for the checks.  Goes great as a filler, and would be at home in any collection.  The Uberplay box is way oversized, but one could put the whole game in a card box and chuck the main box if space is an issue.

Uberplay edition. Seemed like a nice alternate to High Society. EDIT: Played and really like the two phases of the game. It's a filler that has a theme in it that sort of makes sense, much like Modern Art's theme makes sense.  EDIT: My friend tried the "don't bid on anything and take the lowest card" strategy which totally doesn't work. But it was funny. EDIT: I think this plays better with less than 6 as the bidding gets crazy really quickly.

I bought this having heard that it was a fun light bidding game. I don't have any other games that have the same sort of bidding as this (ie, not completely blind bidding) and bought it to round out my collection and try something different. I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would. It's not something I could play for a whole evening but it's fun to play a couple of times before a longer deeper game.

I lost my first game by a large margin, so I didn't quite grasp the relative values at first, but I came in second by one coin my second game.

Everyone starts with the same amount of money.  Properties of varying values are auctioned, n at a time (where n= number of players).  So in a 4 player game, there would be 7 rounds of auctions, high bidder taking high valued property, and so on.  When all properties are auctioned, they are used in a blind auction to win cheques of differing denominations, n at a time.  Everyone secretly selects a property from their hand, and they are revealed simultaneously.  Highest valued property gets the biggest cheque, and so on.  Again, in a 4p game, there would be 7 rounds of blind bidding for cheques.  Most cash wins.  Play time is 15 minutes with rules explanation.  This is fast and exciting, and among the best fillers out there.

RATING: 9.5
Just bumped this to an 8, and it may even go up to a 9.  It is almost as pure an auction game as you can get.  The first phase is an open-auction where timing is everything in that you can get half-price on almost anything, but will pay full-price if the timing is bad.  The silent auction of the second round is very entertaining, and even if you have a lousy hand from the first round, it's still entertaining to see what you can make out of it.  It seems that I'm almost always ending the night playing this one.

UPDATE: Have to move this to a 9, as I just really enjoy playing it.

RATING: 6
Super simple, super fast auction game.  The game consists of two phases.  In the first phase players bid to win property cards with numerical values on them.  In the second phase players play these property cards to win cards with monetary values on them.  The player with the most money at the end of both phases wins.

There's not much to this game at all but it does play in about 15 minutes and presents players with a couple of decisions to make.  My plays with this game so far have both been with 3 and I've heard and can see how this would be more interesting with the full complement of 6.

One of those light, accessible fillers that is fun and quick to play. Even though I am not the biggest fan of bidding mechanics I really enjoyed this one, it probably helped that after the auction round we get a round of simultaneous play, a mechanic I love. A half point extra from me since I thought all the properties had cute designs, not sure others would agree on this one but I like the houses. We played with 5 and it is probably a better game with more (than the min. of 3) players.

"Try to get the highest numbered card here."
"Play the highest numbered card out of all the players to get the highest numbered card from this pile."

Quite easy to teach and pick up. It's really no wonder why it's remained so popular over the years. Simple and elegant is an apt description for it. It's strange how you can get so much enjoyment out of a game that's just chips, a deck numbered 1-30, and a second deck numbered 0 and 2-15 x2.

Got the travel edition and am quite pleased with how space efficient the box is. It accommodates sleeved cards (though it leaves no room for the chips) and leaves very little extra space. (It's also kind of scary how the non-travel version which has virtually the same components costs more than twice what the travel version does.)

The property deck is also useful for mapping it to No Thanks! and possibly other card games where the cards are simply numbered. For Sale also conveniently comes with chips, which are also useful for mapping No Thanks!.

A decent little filler--there are better games that fit in a similar time frame--No Thanks, Nicht Die Bohne, Sticheln, but this is decent.  it's basically just a pure bidding game divided into an open bidding game followed by a blind bidding game.  Mechanics-wise it's fine, but usually I want a little more even from a filler.  I did pick up a couple extra sets on a Tanga sale to give as gifts for our parents who are all dabbling in eurogaming.

Excellent trick taking game that's great for 3-6 players. It only takes a couple of minutes to teach and about 20 minutes to play. I have yet to teach this game to any group of people that did not want to play again as soon as they had finished. The game already has a pretty small box but you can cut down even more if space is an issue. It's 60 cards and about 70 round coin tokens. Never a problem finding people to play this one.

This game really is a perfect "filler", as long as you have the right number of players (I imagine 4 or 5 would be best).  It is extremely simple, plays shockingly quickly, and, most importantly, it's fun!  It's also the ideal auction game for a new gamer since the value of each item in comparison to the others is known outright (with auction games, it's often impossible for a new player to know the value of items that they are bidding on, and therefore how much they ought to bid).  The artwork is cute (in a good way!), my only quibble with the components being that players are supposed to keep their money secret yet no player screens are provided.  There are more interesting auction games out there (such as "Modern Art", but I don't think there are any that are more approachable or fast-playing than "For Sale".  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Brilliant double-auction filler -- buy property cards in the first round, then bid with those for money cards (i.e., flip the properties for a profit). Total money wins.

[Uberplay 05 edition] {Merchant, filler; auction, blind-bidding; optimal 4-6p} For Sale is a fast-paced filler with great player interaction and plenty of fun. It has a good combination of bidding and double-guessing. Since every player gets one house each turn, it doesn't have much down time because players won't complete aggressively and think too much in the bidding; esp. when someone has spent for the first few houses.

FS is unique in the sense that it involves 2 different genres of bidding. In the 1st round, players use limited 'money' to collect houses with open bidding and use the collected houses to bid for the check in the 2nd round. Therefore, even if a player collects a decent set of houses, he could not win the game because he cannot get high-value checks due to the chaos in blind bidding. (Some players are smart in open bidding but dull in closed bidding.) Each turn is repetitive but the game is fast enough and ends before every one gets bored.

Making decisions in FS is easy. The only difficult part is in the closed bidding; esp. when high-value checks are mixed with low-value/VOID checks. From my experience, it's better to get more middle-value houses than a handful of high- and low-value houses.  In addition, it can be nasty to block your left-hand players with high bid at the first round.

The graphics of the cards are very beautiful. I like that each house has its own illustration. It is of very good production - Uberplay is exceptional in producing high-quality card game!

[Update] There is an error in the rule of first edition.  The revised rule makes more sense.

Fun enough filler game.  I'm awful at it, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.  Cute art, goes by quickly, and has a nice sense of tension due to the fact that you never get any income and a press-your-luck element from not wanting to be the person who pays their full bid.  Good for light-gaming groups.

Holy cow is this game fun...and easy to explain and play...and fast. I think that I've gotten probably almost a dozen plays out of this since I acquired it not even a week ago. The kids like it and I can see it easily coming out at just about any function that we would want to play a game.

I will say that I wasn't thrilled with the quality of the cards; after the first shuffle I noticed that several of the cards were bending to the point of having noticeable creases. This should stop being an issue once the sleeves I ordered (Mayday Dark Green) show up, but I could see it becoming a problem with more plays unsleeved.

70-100 plays in (because I use it as an intro game so often), I'm getting a bit tired of it though.  Gives you appreciation for hearts, bridge, spades, euchre, and poker when you start playing other games 100 times.

Very tired of For Sale.  Still play it a lot because new players usually love it.  But 150 plays is too many.  Was an 8 for the first 100 plays.

One of the greatest fillers of all time and a wonderful gateway game.  The simplicity of the design is matched by the tough choices you have to make.  The length is ideal and the game scales perfectly from 3-6 although 4 is probably the sweet spot.  Easy rules make this is snap to teach.

RATING: 8
Played 20+ times.  Quick light filler.  Has become a hit with my co-workers.  I really like how the two halves of the game are tied together.  Lots of group think.  A bit random with people you haven't played with before.  Can't decide if I like round up or round down.  I think I'm leaning towards round up, because then if you bid 1 you pay 1 instead of 0.  Would like to try the original round and round and match bidding. 2008/11/26

My wife and I both do not really like auction/bidding games, but this one was not too bad. Primarily it was short, which keeps it in the playable category. If it was too much longer I do not think it would be brought out.

If a person bothered to count cards they would have a real advantage in this game.

RATING: 8
Really a fantastic filler, especially because gamers and NGFs can play on almost the same level.

The uberplay version is just gorgeous, and there is so much joy in two quick round of different auctions. Your pickings in the first part don't determine whether you've won or lost the whole game, they just tell you how you should be bidding in the all-important second half. Nothing is fated. This game is a beauty.

Has an awkward, utterly non intuitive, and silly bidding system in the first half of the game but somehow the whole thing works. Probably because you can play a decent 5 player game in 15 minutes. Not without some decision making. It's a bidding war in two stages, you can get messed up by all the chaos generated by the players but it's sort of fun and play time works well. Played this quite a few more times in the past year and we still are not tired; played with 4 players and 3 with different groups. Need to put more thought into strategy, fast and fun and you never know till you count it up at the end.

tl;dr: holds up

This is such a cool little game. First you use money to auction checks, then in the second half you use those checks to blind bid for properties of different values. It's so simple and effective. The fun of course comes from knowing who is holding what checks in the second half and anticipating when these might come out. Sometimes people save them for later and only crappy properties come up.
This all comes together very well in a game that will keep on hitting the table for years to come.

This is one of my favorite light games to pull out.  It can play in about 15-20 minutes and with bidding AND blind bidding involved in different parts of the game it makes for the best of both worlds.  Not quite as good as Modern Art.  What it does have in its favor however is quicker time play and easier to introduce to new players.  I would almost consider this the "gateway" game for Modern Art.

Son saw the money on the back of the box and that appealed to him, he LOVES money and saving it. So I warned him that he'd have to spend it to win it back. The very first game he spent it all too quick and was not too happy, but he still came second which surprised him. We played 4 rounds as we each won one and by the tie breaker he had figured when to pass and laughed his head off to win the smelly old box. I was dead proud of him!! It is great to have a brand new fluff/filler game to play, what great fun for all.

This is a really hard rating.  I bring this often to my game nights, and it just...doesn't get to the table.  People choose other filler games (the group calls them "warmup" games), and never this one.  But I like this one.  I'm usually willing to play - so it gets a 7 - and I think it should get played more - there's the .1.  But I bet my group would give it a 5.

I find this game a bit dull - I played several games against three other players and found   it a strangely detached experience. You make binary choices over a couple of rounds and cannot really influence or know your opponents actions. You still have no idea how you have done in the final round of bidding and then you win or lose by a low margin completely by chance. 

I think the final round (swapping properties for cheques) could be livened up by having a bigger range of cheque amounts. 

Overall this isn't for me. I like to play against my opponents and this just doesn't deliver.

Probably my favorite filler game.  Only takes 15 minutes, but full of difficult decisions, second-guessing, and fun.

Update: 11/1 - I still really like this game, but it has dropped a bit in my preference.  The time of the game is dependent on the players (i.e., AP-prone players can take a while to make bidding decisions).  It is still my favorite filler, but I would take another game - coloretto, mystery rummy, etc - if I thought it would take less time).

For Sale seems to always get mentioned in the same breath as No Thanks, and I ended up playing them both for the first time one after the other. I like how there are the two different phases and how they interact. But, the bidding mechanic in the first phase was a little clunky and the whole game felt very random and heavily influenced by player order. This got my usual filler response of "meh". It's a good game considering it was made in 1997, but For Sale just doesn't quite hold up for me, especially when compared to No Thanks!.

I highly recommend this game for a tense filler. Every turn presents exciting and terribly difficult decisions. Managing your hand is incredibly thought-consuming.

To give you an idea of how good For Sale is as a filler, I only opened it three days ago and I've already logged 14 plays. It's one of those games you can't play just once.

Perhaps my favourite filler game in my collection, it allows you to show people that there are correct ways to bid in a game, and that there is an object strategy to selling your properties.

RATING: 9
My one "can't miss" game for almost any group.  Everyone who plays it likes it.  After one game everyone gets it and wants to try again.
I've played it quite a bit and I am still not tired of it.

I think one of the things that makes this one great is that there are both in-game strategies and meta-game strategies that are both working at different levels yet are both grasped easily enough. People can sink their teeth into the process that is most fun to them and have an equal chance of winning. And if you are particularly poor at evaluating value (Auction Phase) then you have a chance to make up for it in the Selling Phase. It's almost like a gamers game and a party game in one. 

What I'm saying is that there are lots of ways to enjoy this game. It can be all things to all people.

Update: Raised rating from 8 to a 9.  This game should be in every collection. It is a great title to get non-gamers into more game-y thinking.  Scales well from 3-6 and I still haven't found a group who doesn't like it.  

It is simply one of my all-time favorites.

Update:  Still a 9. Everything I wrote is still true. I have had some pretty tough individuals (not just non-gamers, but ANTI-gamers) at the table who have enjoyed this one. 

From the standpoint of versatility this is nearly a perfect game.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

I am sold on this game.

This highly popular card game filler is one that lives up to it's lofty reputation.  It is a fast,  two stage auction affair,  that should appeal to most any gamer.  Any criticisms of the game,  although there aren't many,  can be quelled by it's short duration.  In the rare instances that a game falls flat.  you can just reload and shoot again.

It has been my experience that this game is always a worthwhile investment.  This is a sentiment,  that for the most part,   is unanimously shared by a number of players with a wide range of preferences.

So,  prepare to flip those cards - and hopefully flip those houses -  for untold millions,  or at the very least,  for more profit than the rest of your fellow real estate moguls.

This is fun, unpredictable, and light. There's definitely strategy here and better players will often win. However, there's not quite enough going on to make it playable all the time.

Another game stripped down to its pure essence, though I don't enjoy this as much as [gameid=5782].  Quick and fun, with silly graphics.  Might be great with a group of experienced players, but that would require a lot more plays.  Will it make it to the table that often?

Update: After 25 plays, there is little question about its longevity.  It has been the go-to filler when you need to burn 15 minutes.

This is a fast moving game with light but solid strategy. There is a combination of "card counting" and bluffing that players can utilize to their advantage along with simple careful planning on which card sets to invest in and which to accept losses on. I wouldn't hesitate to pull this out as a filler, but by itself I'd find myself still itching to player a deeper game and unwilling to continue with replays of this one.

Our family has a lot of fun with this double auction game.  It's especially funny when some of the kids really want a specific property not because of the card value but because of the property itself...watching them fight over the motor home or outhouse is hilariously silly.

A good fun game overall.

Nice light filler auction game. The interesting mechanic is two-passes where players first bid normally for properties used as currency in the second set of blind auctions. 

To avoid seeing new players flounder, it's worth pointing out that spreads rather than absolute values are important.

Well now, this was a far more interesting bidding game than I initially anticipated.  The buying phase is interesting but feels like it has some deterministic flaws based on turn order.  The selling phase on the other hand works great and has a lot of second guessing and it feels great when you get a bargain.

For a game that plays in 15 minutes, you get a good amount of decision making.

Fun, Fast, and Furious Filler. If only Mr. Friese designed it.  Honestly, I don't mean to F the game like that.  Good player interactions, press your luck, and easy to play while drunk.  Playing well while drunk is still to be seen.  Solid game and its short.  Its a bit static, but for a short game thats ok.  Does not have the great laugh moments and trash talking moments as other light fillers I enjoy, nor does it have the hidden depth of other quick games.  Still a good way to spend 20 minutes.

Great filler!

It has two distinc phases:

1 - Properties equal to the number os players are put for an open auction. The first that passes, get the one that has the lowest number. The second, the second lowest, until the winning bid get the higher number. This go on until every property is sold;

2 - Then, a number of money cards equal to the number of players are put for closed auction. So everyone chooses a property, then all of them are revealed in the same time. The property with the highest number gets the card worth more; the second gets the second most valued card and so on. This happens until all the properties are sold.

After these two phases, the player with more money, win!

It is easy to understand and it is great fun to play. The game is fast and tense, with laughs and curses - so all the good stuff.

The artwork is nicely done.

It's hard for me to grade a filler higher than 8, but For Sale sure is making me want to give it a .5 or 1 point more.

RATING: 7
You bid out of a smallish treasury to get properties, and then bid those properties to collect larger amounts of money. So it's two iterations of conversion, though in the first stage it is impossible to bid what something will actually be worth as you don't have that much money. This need to convert one thing into another as "losslessly" as possible is interesting.

But I don't like the chaos that results from the fact that all players are simultaneously trying to bid on three things.

...Up a bit. It's a fun game with others.

As far as fillers go, this is a keeper. However, unlike many, I find For Sale significantly weaker than High Society as far as auction fillers go. While both games center around evaluating your opponents moves, the luck factor for For Sale is much higher, round after round, than High Society. The order of how checks emerge from the deck greatly influences property selection. While this is the basis for most of the game, I found the final phase of the game to be most chaotic and uncontrollably random. I was unable to even make educated guesses and if someone is adept at card counting this would most certainly break the game. Compared that with High Society, the single luck factor in that auction game is when the fourth red card will emerge. So, there is that single risk aspect to the game. When all is said and done, For Sale is still a decent filler if only as a filler, it will only be played every so often.

The most egalitarian of auction games. Everyone likes it because no-one walks away unhappy. Oddly enough, that doesn't really endear it to me, but I can't deny it's appeal.

For Sale is a very competent auction-based filler game that plays in two stages. Players attempt to acquire desirable properties in the first stage by outbidding opponents, taking care not to overbid. In the second stage, the players compete to sell their properties to the best buyers in the market.

Components: The game comes with 30 property cards which are beautifully illustrated and quirky, ranging from space stations to castles to literally a box in an alley. The game also includes coins for money and money cards for the second stage of the game in denominations from $0-$15,000 which are very basic in design.

Ease of learning/teaching: The game mechanics are very simple to explain and pick up, even for non-gamers.

Theme: The game is an auction game at heart and the theme is skin deep. However, it does the job and provides set-ups for appropriate real estate jokes, which is all you can really ask for from a game of this weight.

Gameplay: The game plays fast and has plenty of depth despite its weight. It takes a few games to develop an intuition and strategy to bid correctly, and rounds of the game make for excellent lessons in rudimentary game theory. The game ends quickly enough to adjust your approach and set up for another round.

A fun, fast paced game with simple and straightforward mechanics.

An interesting game, and my group's introduction to the bidding genre of games. Although of my group of 4, I'm probably the least mathematically inclined, I typically do well or win at this game. Although the financial management themes are strong here, they don't actually make or break the game for you. The second half of the game is where the win is made or lost. A relatively light and breezy game. Could be played with non-gamers.

RATING: 8
I have only played once.  When I read the rules, I did not see a game here.  It seemed too simple.  Fortunately, it works very well in practice, and I really like that I was able to turn some really moronic plays in the first part of the game into a better position at the end.

I have played a couple more times now.  I kind of like the fact that you have to plan your approach based on where you are in the seating order.  Since if you are near the end of the round, you can expect to either pay alot or resign yourself to a lower card.  I will have to try the game with the original rules that allow you to meet the previous bid to see if I like that better, but it doesn't really sound as interesting that way.

For sale is a very simple game, and easy to learn, but i really enjoyed playing it. There is a strategy to the game, and I thought that finding out what the strategy was, was rally fun. The pictures add a sense of humor to the game, like for instance the soggy cardboard box in the alley way. It is a smaller game, so you can easily play it on the go, and the length is quite short. This is a very convenient game for playing in school, and a real enjoyment.

Just a little bit too light for me. Its hard to keep track of how much you paid for each property and what you should try to get out of each one. It could get a higher rating, but I just don't really see a good strategy you can put together.

Buy and sell real estate. There are 2 parts to a game: an initial "buying phase" where houses of different values are auctioned and players build their hands, and a second "selling phase" where these cards are played simultaneously in an attempt to win the highest valued checks. Player making the most money wins. Plays extremely quickly (15-20 minutes), really easy to teach and understand, and offers tough and interesting tactical decisions with bluffing along the way. Above all, this game is fun! The perfect filler, should be in every gamer's collection.

A short and sweet game that's played in two parts. First you buy houses and then you try to sell them off. This game uses a blind bidding mechanic in both parts of the game which fit the game really well. Blind bidding has some strategy in it, but a huge portion of luck as well. This fits this particular light game though. Artwork is good and fitting and I even find it a bit funny (cardboard box for the cheapest house, space station for most expensive). Overall, I'd consider this a heavy filler that's definitely going to stay in my collection.

RATING: 7
Quick and easy, so it's great filler, but it needs a bit more zing to liven it up. We'll see if more plays change my opinion.

Update: The game does what it's supposed to do quite well. I don't think it needs to do anything else. It's fast, slightly intelligent, and approachable. If I want a game with more "zing" there are plenty of games that offer excitement, but at the cost of simplicity or structure.

This is a filler to pull out between eurogames, not between ameritrash games.

Not a bad little filler at all.  I wouldn't go out of my way to play this with everyone in my life, but with the right group of people, you might just find this "filler" filling up the whole night.  I particularly like the Buyer's Market and Seller's Market phases of the game, as you can feel your fortunes rise and fall with the local housing market without ruining your personal finances.

Edit: Moved from 7 to 8.5.  Its one of those that gets better, not worse, with more plays!  Hooray!

Easy to teach, easy to learn, and easy to play.  Pretty much perfect for filler.  Enough interesting decisions that the best players will win most of the time, but enough tension and luck that the weaker players will stay interested.

Auction game, where you first bid openly for the apartments (basically you are avoiding the lowest apartment). Once all the apartments are sold (takes couple of rounds), you blind bid for checks with apartments (so you are selling your houses). It is fast and simple game, but auction games are just not for me. It takes naturally couple of plays to understand the proper bid values. Happily the game is short and it is played in fifteen minutes. Okay filler.

'For Sale' is themed around buying and selling properties in order to make the most profit and be declared the winner. This is done over a series of bidding rounds.
Each player starts with the same amount of money, despite some initial confusion over this (!), and bids in sequence on the property cards displayed in front of them.
The person bidding the most will select the highest valued property (1 - 36?) and as each bid is made, there is an option to 'go higher' or pass as you cannot overbid!
Passing means that the player takes the lowest valued property , so over time, it may be that you could still get a reasonable property even if you pass later than someone else.
Passing also means that any bids you may have made are refunded to you in their entirety. The highest bidder pays their full bid, and all other purchases are halved.
I hope this is correct as my memory of the game is limited! Once all the properties are acquired, properties are used to acquire cheques of various sizes in the next phase.
This is done by secretly bidding a property based on the player's estimation of whether their bid will be enought to get the highest price and involves significant bluff and luck.
There are some void cheques, and I got one of those, but with the second lowest property value bid, that was hardly surprising! Knowing the spread of cheques values would help here.
Of course, that requires several plays, and this may not be a game for everyone. For me, it was alright, and the theme and mechanics played well enough, but I don't believe its replay value is good.

If For Sale were only the first half of the game, then it would just be one more game in a long line of bidding games.  If it were only the second half of the game, then it would just be one more game in a long line of Raj games.  Put them together, though, and you have a neat game where the choices you make in the first half of the game determine how you play in the second half.  I think it's that transition that makes this game so enjoyable for me.

Count me among the folks who prefer the Ravensburger edition of the game over the uberplay/FRED edition.  For one, the ability to call a bid instead of raising it means that players can stay in the bid for a longer time, thus helping them stay in the game.  For another, the game should max out with 5 players instead of 6, because with 6, you don't have as many cards in hand for the second half of the game to stay as competitive, and pairing the 6 players with the inability to call a bid means that the player who starts a bid will likely be out of it by the time the bid has made it all the way around the table.  Lastly, the distribution of the checks in the Ravensburger edition makes more sense to me.

2 plays: 4 players (Ravensburger edition)
2 plays: 5 players (Ravensburger edition)
1 play: 3 players (uberplay edition)
3 plays: 4 players (uberplay edition)
3 plays: 5 players (uberplay edition)
4 plays: 6 players (uberplay edition)

I still win marginally more than my fair share of games, indicating that my decisions ARE, long run, giving me the edge. But this is barely noticeable.

Super easy to teach.
Light weight.
Low-medium player interaction.
Medium theme application.

So quick, easy and efficient that losing doesn't sting for too long and card selection doesn't guarantee winning. The key is to be wise with what you use. Most games are pretty hilarious.

[b][i]For Sale [/i][/b]is a wonderfully easy to teach auction game that's perfect for both newbies and old hands. With the Uberplay edition, I prefer playing that you can take back half your chips (instead of half your bid) as doing so makes the big chips meaningful. No matter how you play, though, this game is a winner.

This is a short, fairly easy to explain, filler card game that feels a bit like No Thanks in mechanics.  I like this game better than No Thanks, but both have their place.  This one is a little more strategic and (in my opinion) more interesting.  But they both do a similar thing.  I think if you already have the "light filler card game" in your collection than you really don't need to pick this up.  But if you enjoy that style of game, check it out.

For Sale is a great family/filler game. It is about as simple to play as games get, yet the act of play is exciting. Between auctioning in the beginning and second-guessing your opponents during the cash-grab in the second half, players are always on their toes and trash-talking is second-nature.

Highly recommended for family gatherings as the game supports up to 6 players and plays in about 15 minutes.  By fast and frantic nature, it's a game that people generally won't want to play just once, so be prepared for bouts of 3, 4 or even more plays in a row.

A game that belongs in every collection.

I guess my problem with this game is that it depends twice (or two much, haha) on bidding which I tend to not be good at. Value is just another thing I chronically misjudge (along with distance, time, etc.). On the other hand, I quite like the concept and the artistry of the cards. It's quick, easy, and fun to play. I do enjoy it, just not as much as I could if the mechanics were slightly different.

This game held no interest for me, because it sounded rather dull.  Then I played it and was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

Super fast, super fun bidding game which is split into two clever, and satisfying phases. Buy houses via auctions, then bluff your botty off trying to win the biggest cheques for your low value cardboard boxes and bins.

Artwork has just the right comedy/cartoony tone and the joy in grabbing a high cheque with a rubbish house is remarkably satisfying.

check out the $olitaire entry in the game's forum. It works amazingly well for a game which appears impossible to solo.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Around 5 plays, with 3-5 players. 

Like: Easy to learn and easy to teach. The two phase structure of the game makes teaching new players particularly easy, since the two phases can be taught independently. There is unique and often amusing artwork for all 30 of the property cards which is quite engaging. I particularly enjoy the property flipping in the 2nd phase. It sets up some interesting scenarios of trying to guess what your opponents will play. It's also very satisfying to use a low-numbered property to snatch a high-value money card, or to force everyone else to take bad money cards by playing a high-numbered property. 

Dislike: The mechanics of the auction phase are a little strange, particularly with 5+ players. The auction is a partially all pay system, in which everyone except the winner of the auction pays half their bid rounded down. However, the rounding down has a massive effect because typical bids are in the $3-6,000 range, which gets rounded to $1-3,0000. There is thus little incentive to bid even numbers unless you expect your bid to be the final bid (so that you win the auction). This drives prices very high very quickly, since players will be incrementing by $2000 instead of $1000. With 5 players, what then happens is that once you pay a high price for a property (and thus get reduced to around $5000 or so), if the bidding starts a few players to your right, then the price will shoot up to a point that you cannot afford and you will be forced to take the lowest numbered property, even though you have plenty of money. With high player counts it is hard to defend against this unless you hold onto your money (since it's nearly impossible to control where the bidding will start or end unless you make a high bid), but then if all players are tight with their money, the game becomes quite boring. 

The other main aspect of the game I dislike is the strong memory aspect. For Sale immensely rewards tracking what cards have come out of the deck so far and knowing what properties each of your opponents has. This is exacerbated in the 5-player game since no cards are removed from the property or money decks, so that the last round of each phase will have a completely determined tableau of cards available at the end. I'm also not a fan of the last round of the property flipping phase, since it is played automatically (each player only has one property left which they must play). 

Overall: A solid, quick game which is easy to teach and has very charming artwork. The auction becomes a little funky with 5+ players.

Game is quick to pick up and play, has the potential to become an addiction. We've had it out two or three times (with 3 and 4 players, respectively, though I'm eager to play with 5 or 6) and each time we've played multiple rounds in succession. 

The game is simple (basically two rounds of bidding) but has enough meat to stay interesting and enough (mild) strategy to keep me from being bored. Very quick paced, which leaves me wanting more.

The entire game is basically 2 rounds of auctions -- the first round is open bidding with money/coins where you bid on the highest value property. Your bid is visible to others as it's happening.  The 2nd round is selling your newly acquired properties for checks (money).  Each player simultaneously selects a property to sell and checks are assigned based on property values. The player with the most money wins.  It's easy to teach, bidding gets crazy, and it plays in about 15 minutes per game.  One of my favorite fillers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
{ P - [4] 5 6 }

The first round is often stagnant; each property has a ceiling price where bidding higher simply isn't worth it. Once bid, everyone else drops out unless they arbitrarily feel compelled to bid higher for the privilege of going first. The second round is very random and has this bluff / double-bluff issue where you draw a pool of say Void 3 5 13 and everyone knows the differential is huge and the 30 is coming out ... unless the people who don't have 30 trash low houses and the guy with 30 plays 15-20 instead. Ten minute filler, at least.

The card stock could be slightly thicker though. The game does not scale that well to 5 or 6 players though.

Adictivo a más no poder, el filler más simpático con el que me he topado, no obstante lo vendo debido a mi actual política antifiller.

one of the best fillers around, first round of bidding is HOW MUCH DO I BID?, second round of bidding is WHEN DO I BID THIS?...fun

Wow -- what a great little game! Not many better for the 10-15 minute filler category. I absolutely love the two phase approach, where you bid in the first half to "draft" cards you want to use to actually earn money in the second half. Incredibly clever, easy to teach/learn, and a lot of fun. I wish I would have come across this game years ago!

What a great filler! You can explain the rules in a minute, first an open auction, then a closed auction, most money at the end wins. It even works to simply start playing after the simplest of rules intros. Wonderful filler.

A light filler that is a great change after we tried to play Ninja: Legend of the Scorpion Clan.  It was fast and simple.  Although, some of my friends pretty much went all in on the first hand and couldn't buy up any more properties!

A quick, fun filler. Gain properties in the auction round then try to trump your opponent's properties for the most money.

Kind of disappointing to find out that I don't enjoy pure bidding game all that much, nor am I very good at it.  It certainly is easy to play and to teach, but I'm not sure if I'll play it very often.

Update #1: Unfortunately this is the ultimate filler.  While I prefer not to participate at all, it is almost always the game of choice when waiting for people to show up before diving into a meatier and longer title.  Argh!

Wonderful, fast filler.  Easy to learn, difficult to be good at.  You have an idea who's going to win during the second phase, but even that is sometimes a surprise.  Instant favorite.

A great game if you like auctions.  Phase 1 you auction in buying buildings, and in Phase 2 you sell your buildings at auction.  Simple game mechanic and a fun play for larger groups.

A fun little game that I can't, nor will I ever be able to win.  It can be a little luck dependent, both on what cards come up, and who you are sitting next to.

Klassz és pörgős licitálós partijáték, mely két részre oszlik. Az elsőben licitálunk a lapokra, melyekkel a második részben ütéseket fogunk vinni. Szuper ötlet, sok nevetéssel, 3-tól 6 főig!

After 5+ Plays: Very quick and very fun.  What more could you ask for?

After 10+ Plays: My favorite filler.  It's all interesting decisions and no busywork.  I'd play several rounds of this over a lot of longer games.

After 30+ Plays: This is just the perfect filler - I really doubt it will ever be surpassed.  No set-up or tear-down time, 20 minutes from opening the box to putting it back on the shelf, and yet it really feels like a complete game with interesting decisions.  Beyond the realm of fillers, I'd say only Ra is a better pure auction game.

With the 2 very different phases the game offers more than a lot of new card games. I played it several times now and it really has a nice balance between skill, guessing what the others are doing and of course some luck. Very recommended!

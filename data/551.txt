I actually played this when it was first released and thought, "What a great game!" It was a birthday present for a 12 year-old, and I was the purchaser. It was a great deal of fun... and after obtaining a used edition of this for myself recently, will -- no doubt -- feel that way again.

I was introduced to this by my GW friend SA. After getting it for a Christmas gift one year, I spent countless hours playing Battle Cry with my friend Dave back in college. We played through the entire set of scenarios as a campaign and had a great time. Dave was a blast to play with, he combined shit-talking with sportsmanship in a very nice way. 

After recently getting Memoir '44, I had to downgrade Battle Cry. It probably won't get played since the Memoir rules are more balanced. However, it'll stay in my top 10 as one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had.

Easy to learn and play game.  The combat system is simple and keeps the game moving.  However, combat is very 'dicey' and also depends on the card draw.  Game length is short and game allows only 2 players.  The components are of excellent quality.

GREAT FUN and VERY addictive!

Good strategic options.
High replay value due to all the scenarios. Plays VERY QUICKLY (under 45 minutes)!!

But: can be VERY frustrating due to 2 sources of luck:
a. the dice (minor)
b. the cards (MAJOR)

But I don't think luck alone can explain my sorry record of only 2 wins from 9 plays!

Update: Okay. I'm winning a lot more now (around 50:50). This gets better all the time (going from a low 10 to a high 10!). 

And this year it's shaping up to be the most played game in my collection (yet again).

Fluid battles, swift informed decision-making and wonderful componenets make this a big-box gem. Battles can have too much randomness with the tired die rolling system. The best laid plans can be ruined with poor luck. Overall the replay value is high with all the 3rd party support, so one can charge again and again.

RATING: 8
To be honest this game is as good as the games that followed it. The first to use the Commands & Colors system (begging the question why it isn't called the Battle Cry system) it plays just as easy and flawlessly as Memoir '44 and BattleLore. The problem is its limited game play. You can buy enough Memoir '44 modules that chances are you may never play them all. Plus the original BattleLore has plenty of content too and BattleLore 2.0 is coming out with new additions all the time. But Battle Cry just has the scenarios that come in the box (sans fan additions) so it runs of out replayabilty pretty quickly. It is odd that this game died the way it did. It was even given an anniversary edition but still no new content. If this game did have the kind of content that Memoir did we might be hard pressed to decide which one to keep. But with Battle Cry's limited content , Memoir '44 wins that challenge hands down.

I loved this game at first, but I'm starting to lose some taste for it as it has become increasingly obvious that the game is strongly dictated by two overpowering luck elements.  Enough so that it is almost impossible to mitigate the luck through careful strategy.  Having a handful of skirmishes against your opponent's hand full of assaults and attacks really can kill the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple game, high replayability. (~25 games before I started tracking). Reasonable amount of luck; given its length.

I'd graft on a few card changes from Memoir/BattleLore. 1) All probes now draw a card. 2) Change All out Assualt to "Activate a # of units equal to your command rating." 3) Give all special cards the "Or activate a single unit, if you have no X." Otherwise it's fine.

Rating -- Suggest (but too big to carry around)

A great 2 player Civil War game. Like all C&C games, it plays quickly, has solid, easy to understand rules, and has good components. Since its release, several newer Command and Colors games have been released that make Battle Cry seem a bit clumsy, forcing me to drop the score a bit. Fortunately, by taking a few ideas from the other C&C games, Battle Cry is still an excellent game. Some of the variants here on the geek have some great ideas for using some of the C&C Ancients Rules that really breathe some life into this slightly aging game. With the "C&C Ancients" variants, I'd rate the game an 8.

The Command Cards allow for little to no card magagement.  I argue that you need a larger hand size.  It would also help if both players drew an even number of good cards.  If one player consistently is allowed to use 3 units compared to only 1 unit, the fun factor plummets.

Picked up my copy when Wizards of the Coast store fronts were closing up and they were slashing prices.  What a find!  Have enjoyed the strategy and frustrations this game brings to the table.  Appreciate the fact that, as in real battlefield situations, orders may be lost, garbled, delayed, or not followed, much to the chagrin of the commanding officer.  Playing of the game led me to Memoir '44, and prompts me to look into playing/owning Command and Colors: Ancients as well as Battlelore.  Would like to plays these later permutations to see if the differences are attractive enough to invest in their theme/system changes. [Sale price $7.68]

Since the moment I laid eyes on this game at GenCon 2000, I was in love with it!  Easy, fun, gameplay that forces you to make the best of what you have at any given time, and makes you devise contingency plans up the ying yang, because more often then not, you DON'T get the cards you need.  I love it, and think it is the second best of the Richard Borg Commands and Colors series of rules, C&C: Ancients being the best.

When a friend and I made a 2 week trip to Europe, I threw together a magnetic version of the game that consisted of a piece of sheet metal with a blank white hexmap taped to it, covered in clear packing tape, and a number of 1/2" counters I painted in appropriate colors and icons to represent the armies.  When we would decide on a scenario, I would use overhead projector pens to draw the terrain and we would have at it!  A lot of games were played on trains, between our beds, and in hotel lobbies.

In comparison with Memoir '44, I haven't played Memoir more than a few times, but I had played Battle Cry twice before Memoir, and twice afterwards.  What I miss the most in Memoir are the generals, even though they are not as effective as the leaders in C&C: Ancients are.  Otherwise I'm having fun, and think I will run through all the scenarios at least once before trading this game away due to space issues (which may or may not get resolved one day).

Having played C&C: Ancients, there is a lot that I miss in Battle Cry:  

- the effectiveness of leaders (they are much more potent in Ancients, whereas Generals in Battle Cry are as much liabilities as they are minor boosters); 

- the greater importance of formation (in Battle Cry it's helter-skelter, whereas you are rewarded for more organized phalanxes in Ancients, though I think this way is probably more true to the times that the games represent, respectively); 

- evade I miss very much (and would have fitted in, at the cost of increased complexity); 

- and battle back I especially miss (though am not sure if this would fit in with Battle Cry).

This is still a fun game, and seems fitting.  There are 15 scenarios, which is quite a lot, and there is more in the way of historical text in the scenarios, which is also interesting.

Predecessor of Memoir 44, and arguably, a better game.  Players use a combination of cards (for regulating movement and attacks) and dice (for battle outcomes).  The effect provides semblence of control despite many random elements.  Nice, fast, introductory wargame.  This game also has enough scenarios and variability to keep the most skeptical grognards happy for awhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great simple game to play with non-wargamers. It's short enough that playing 2 out of 3 matches is feasible, which is great because luck can really kill you in this game.

UPDATE: Since this release of Memoire '44 and C&C: Ancients, this game comes off the worse in a comparison. Being dealt a bad hand can kill you worse than in the other games. And what's with the lack of defensive fire?

2017 - (3) - While I've not really returned to this game, my experiences in the other Command and Colors games (notably Memoir '44) have been extremely unsatisfying.  I have insufficient luck tolerance for this to be my kind of game.

The lightest of the C&C games, and probably the most fun for me, as I eventually realized I needed to let go, nothing is really getting simulated here. :) I never really got over the fact that it really made sense to charge forward to get a kill almost whenever possible. The system isn't dynamic enough, with not a lot of room for tactics.

RATING: 9
Easy to learn and set up. Loads of fun for serious and casual gamers alike. Young and older gamers, too, can share a hotly contested game together. However, Battle Cry is no casually assembled game. Its rules reward thoughtful play and card management, while offering enough luck to keep the less able interested as well as offering an outlet for those weird situations attributed to "the fog of war." Battle Cry is actually one of a stable of games in Richard Borg's Command & Colors series.

Update: with the release of the 2010 edition, gamers have a chance to pick up the revised version of the game that started it all. I have the new game and enjoy it a great deal. I like the new terrain effects and the new Command Deck is also an interesting change. Overall, I'd say the new game is a slight improvement over the old, but game play between the two is much the same. Updated to a '9'.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Compared to Memoir '44: Infantry fire is too powerful (4-3-2-1), but the units are too slow (only move one hex). Artillery must have line of sight which makes it less useful, otherwise it is similar. Cavalry work like tanks in Memoir but with only a range of one. No 'taking ground' or 'follow up' atttacks. Having Generals on the field is cool. 

The components are pretty good. The figures are fine. The plastic seems a bit harder than in Memoir/Battlelore. The flag units actually have flags molded to them. The dice are not good. The board is very good. The terrain pieces are fine, but there are not enough of them. 

The command cards are a mixed bag. They don't have any alternate orders at the bottom like in M'44. If you draw an artillary bombard card without any surviving units on the board, you're stuck with it. I find that after 5-6 turns, both players have crap in their hand to play and everything depends on the luck of the draw. The slow infantry require many cards in one section to get in a good attack with follow through. 

Still a good game, but I consider it to be a "rough draft" of what the Command and Colors system has become. I understand that this game is going to be remade in 2010. I'll keep this one until then.

(Update 11/15/08) Ever since they put this up on GameTableOnline.com, I have been playing like mad. I still think that the infantry range should be decreased, but I can live with their slow speed. The "Move all your units" card is still overpowered. In one game I got that card, played it, and drew it again! Luckily I was playing against the AI or I would have been accused of cheating. Might be a better game just to take it out.

RATING: 7
Quick game - I like the theme more than Memoir '44, but that game has a more refined version of the system - in this game some cards (Skirmish) are way under powered and there is the game breaking All-Out Assault - player who draws this often wins. We play skirmish can be used in any region and the All-Out Assault is reduced to 4 units (any region(s)). This pretty much fixes the game :)

RATING: 6
I would love this game except that there's not enough depth to it. I don't like that there's only 3 (three and a half if you count the generals) units in the game. I don't know what other units there could be, but it's too simple.
The gameplay itself is actually kinda fun, but with that said, you'd be better off playing C&C: Ancients or even Memoir '44.
I really want to like this game more, but after playing C&C:Ancients, I just don't think I'll find it fun anymore.

edit: I've finally accepted what this game is and what it isn't, and this game is a fun light quick game based on a great theme (American Civil War). Also, I can get non-wargamers to play.

RATING: 5
A modestly (modestly) fun game that has been simply superceded by later, much superior games with the same system. Memoir '44 is a much cleaner, more interesting game with a lot more variety of play. Command & Colors: Ancients is a thematically truer game with much more interesting tactical play. BattleLore is, well, whatever BattleLore turns out to be. These later games all cash in on the promise that Battle Cry couldn't deliver on. Except maybe BattleLore which turned out to be not awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A cool entry in the Commands & Colors system where you order units based on card play, and fight with some dice.  Hand management is always the key, and rolling dice is of course always fun!

Of course, there are different rules here that make it more Civil-Warry than others in the C&C system that give it its own flavor.

Only loses out to M44 due to bit quality, as well as the expandability that M44 offer.  Battle Cry just never received that sort of support.

150th Anniversary edition. - I liked this far more than my few plays of Memoir '44. I liked that it has simpler gameplay, but the rules for generals add lots of interesting strategy. I like the size and composition of the deck better, as Memoir '44 seemed to often stalemate while people waited for certain cards. 
    - and while I had heard complaints about overpowered cards here, I think this edition fixes that since I didn't notice anything gamebreaking. 

I also think the Civil War theme fits these mechanics somewhat better. I can play this with my 9-year old nephew by simplifying the general rules a little, or my gamer friends and have a good time with both. Nothing earth shattering but a nice little game.

Rated for play with Scribbie's Advanced rules

12+ games 2 player
12+ games solitaire

A solid introductory wargame that's fast, fun, and rewarding for veterans too.  Scribby's Advanced ("ABCDE") rules in BGG's file section improve the game for those ready to "step up" in detail and "realism" (for lack of a better word).

Like the most successful card driven games, each session of BC tells a story ... often of frustrated plans and unbelievable dice ... but a story that leaves you with that, "let's play one more time" feeling.  With scenarios taking 30 to 60 minutes with set-up ... you will play battles time and again.

I also find it a rewarding title to play solitaire.  The same battle can be played twice in an hour.

Game components are top-notch, easily the best in the Commands & Colors family - kudos to Hasbro.

I took years to get a copy ... don't wait.  If you're interested in the American Civil War, or per-modern wargaming at all - consider this title.

RATING: 8.75
Civil War version of Memoir '44.  Perhaps not quite as good as Memoir '44, but a must for Civil War buffs and wargamers (though, like w/ Memoir '44, avid wargamers may find it too simplistic).  For me, the simplicity is part of its appeal.  Production quality is basically on par w/ Memoir '44.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better than Memoir.  Perhaps because I'm burnt out on Memoir, and for some reason the mechanics just don't make sense for mechanized warfare, they work better for ancient and civil war linear warfare.

Plays quick, very simple.  Good for kids and adults.

Had a blast playing this game, and look forward to playing it again.  Does it make sense that an infantry unit with four members is a strong as an infantry unit with one?  No.  Would changing the game to make it more realistic increase the level of fun?  In my opinion, no.  There are many realistic wargames out there already, and few match up to this one in terms of enjoyment for invested time.  I haven't played this as much with the other entries in the series - but I recall having fun with it.  Each entry seems to be getting better, though, so unless you're really into the Commands & Colors system, there's probably no reason to get this one.

RATING: 4.5
The game lacks any drama.  In our games, we just kind of ran at each other, shooting, trying to make something interesting happen.  It was a letdown, since I was really looking forward to an "accessible" war game.  Well, the game may be accessible, but it isn't very good.  I'm still waiting for a good, accessible war game...

Being the first C&C game to be published, it broke a lot of ground.  While the theme is still great and I anxiously await another company to pick it up (and support it with expansions), I think that the game has been outdated with the other games in the series.  I think a few house rules are in order for a few flaws, though it is hard to tell what should be kept because of historical significance and what is improved game play in the other titles.  

The one rule that needs to be changed in the future is the ability to order one unit of your choice when you have useless tactic cards. Another rule that needs to be looked at is allowing Infnatry to move 2 hexes if they choose not to battle.  The game takes longer to develop when they can only move 1 hex at a time but may be refelctive of the period.  The final rule that is questionable is eliminating a unit when it retreats off the board.  It may also be refelctive of a unit being completely broken and going home, but it also seems too extreme when one flag can send a full unit with a general to the victory track with 2 flags.

RATING: 7.5
Fun Command and Color system game. If you are a Civil War buff, you would likely enjoy this. It's lighter and easy to get into but some hardcore grognards may argue it's not "really" a war game. Either way, it's still a good time.

Although quite simple (compared to almost any other "war game") I was quite surprised at the tension and difficult choices you are faced with.  There is (or can be) a fair amount of planning in the way you play your cards. The battles are at least as much positional as they are actual fighting.  It was a long painful process to get the game ready to go out of the box the first time...but after that it was pretty to look at and not as long to set up as I had been led to believe.  I was expecting something lighter and more random.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Excellent game overall. On the lighter side which is usually not to my taste so consider a 9 to be 10 if you like lighter games. This game was incredibly fun and for me had a good feel for the period. Given the fact that a battle can easily be fought in 20 minutes. Our first night we learned the game and played 6 battles in just 4 hours.

RATING: 7
(2007) I don't consider it a replacement for games such as Glory, or even Blue and Grey, because I don't consider it much of a wargame.  But it is kid friendly and appeals to a wider audience than typical wargames.  My 7 year old likes it and can play it (and sometimes beats me and his uncle).  I know some dislike the card element that won't let them micro-control their armies but all I have to do is point to the Battle of Chickamauga for how a battle can get completely out of a commander's control.

2-Player, card driven Civil War battles with miniatures.  Much better than Risk or most other 2 player battle games (except maybe Nexus Ops which I haven't played yet).

That randomness simulates the feeling of issuing real-time battlefield orders in a time before instant communication.

This still remains a favorite... it's quick, it's fun and the addition of optional and house rules offers varying degrees of complexity and "historical feel." And many of my non-gamer friends are more intrigued by Battle Cry than any other game in my collection... I'm not sure if that's due to its extremely eye-catching design (I think it's a much better-looking game than Memoir '44, e.g.) or its American Civil War theme (I do live in The South, after all). It's far from a complex wargame or simulation, but it's still a fun and satisfying gaming experience.

Husband is surprised that wife likes this game.  Wife likes it for its historical accuracy (pseudo-educational), cute bits, and because it is not too hard.  It is very frustrating when you don't get the cards you need to execute a plan, or when you are holding cards you can't use.  Otherwise, we like the variety of scenarios and the option of playing the same scenario from different sides.

Great card mechanism, which you don't expect in a "wargame." (Put that in quotes, since it isn't a traditional sort.) I like card wargames more than dice wargames. Also, great support site at: http://users.erols.com/jadf/bc/

The chaos of the cards limiting your control over your army beautifully mimics the breakdown in communication on the Civil War battlefield.  The frustrating die rolls are perfectly in line with the unpredictable effectiveness of the weapons (and troops) in Civil War battles.  A perfect simulation?  No, not even close.  45 minutes of pure fun with mechanics that effectively convey the theme?  Yes.  This game is a masterpiece.

I started out with Memoir '44 and did not even know this game existed until searching!  

The Commands & Colors system has become my favorite.  It is perfect for this period of my life.  I love the battles (very interested in American Civil War battles), and I rarely have the time to play longer battles.  

This game allows me to play a tough fight in an evening where I actually feel like I played the battle!  

I haven't really gotten too deep into the Advanced Rules, at this time, I really don't see the problem with the originals, in fact I enjoy the differences between the systems and this does feel like Civil War era tactics to me! 

Very pleased to have made a deal on a trade for this game.

Light tactical wargame; plays smoothly; setup a bit long compared with playing time; players do not have a full grip on the battlefield, as they are dependent on the cards they receive for a particular part; for a short game like BC, this is no problem; oldest game in its genre, but certainly not less than the others; lacks the extras Battlelore has; appealing theme and nice components

Battle Cry is a fun play.  Even though the rules are not much different from the other games of it's type, it has a unique feel.  I like how it is a bloody game that drops units fast.  The rules are more simple, and fast to get into.  I would recommend a play if you get the chance.

Very enjoyable light war game. Fairly luck dependent. If you don't need your war games to be simulations with a lot of tuff decisions then you will like this. If you are a simulation, strategy, and tactics type of guy, this game would be about a 3.

An early Commands and Colors game. Still fun, but not enough chrome to bring out the Civil War theme although the pieces are cool. The system is still fun for the occasional play, but in any situation where this would be played I would rather do Memoir (for all the chrome and feel) or Ancients (for a deeper game).

I think that the Command and Colors system is very well suited for Civil War battles, as evidenced by this game. The card system seems to capture the difficulties of exercising effective command and control on the Civil War battlefield. I like both this game and Memoir '44 (a WW2-themed C&C system game), but Battle Cry just feels more historically accurate with this system than M44 (although both are great games in my opinion). Fun, fast, and very replayable - this one gets played alot! Added bonus - many additional scenarios available on the web!

Well I'm impressed. First game really. Wonderful game play! Tense, tactical and plenty of decisions to make. The 'All out' card hmmn not sure on this one I played my first scenario-solo-and lost Pea Ridge to a massive Confederate assault-unable to stop it and I tried real hard (without cheating) The game plays very very well with the cards which stop you from moving everything instead you get cards of a mixture of situation, fate, randomness, luck-basically everything you will find on the battlefields of all wars. 

Increased my rating to 10 OK after so many many plays this game surprises a wargamer of minis since the late 60's...ahem...always fun, even in losing, always exciting
Love the new cards in the 150 Anniversary version, but not the figures so much but the map is very cool, some nice rule tweaks. One for the desert Island. The first one.

RATING: 9
I like this games play mechanic and modular board.  It's nice to have several scenarios to play, and each have a different layout by placing different hexes.  The 3 zone battlefield is interesting, being able to activate people in each zone based on your cards.  It was the first time I had played a game like that.

RATING: 6
Looks cool which is good for getting beginners in and the mechanics are simple with only Line of Sight likely to daunt people used to simpler games. To me it felt a lot like Squad Leader except for the random element of cardplay and the sorely lacking opportunity fire (The attacker can march up & fire at point blank range before the defender gets to shoot back... Crap!). Mmm, maybe I'll use it as a recruiting tool for SL.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Great fun and a great game as long as you're not expecting a simulation style game. A few house rules or variants will give it a much better "realism" factor--battle back/return fire, weapons ranges, movement rates, cavalry charge, etc. Don't overdo it though--the simplicity is what makes this a great game.

Great components, great battles and I really like the battle card system so I am unsure why I did not like this better.  When looking for a game to play for two I tend to pass it up.

RATING: 7
Overall, this game is a lot of fun.  Some of the 15 battles are very unbalanced towards one side (more units, more cards, perfect defensive terrain) but it is fun to see how close you can come to getting the 6 flags for a win.  On the hardest battle, I managed to squeak out 5 the other day...I will get six at some point...I just need that All-Out Offensive card!

RATING: 7
Fast and furious chaotic wargame-lite. Hoards of American Civil War miniatures are driven across a large-hex map via a simple card play system. Play a card, follow the simple instructions, move a few pieces, roll some dice. You can play three or four battles in a two hour session. You can get your hat handed to you through poor cards and/or hot dice, but the basic systems are so easy and accessible you just want to play it.  Great stuff.

[Borg] What an awesome, accessible game! In ten minutes you are ready to go, even with a newbie. I really wish that this had been existed ages ago: it is so hard trying to break in a new gamer on those fiddly old Avalon Hill titles from the 1980's! 

I recommend this title for its fun, simplicity, and fast play. Sure it is a bit random as written... so check out the links here on the 'Geek and see what two simple tweaks can do to reduce randomness!

Gametable online has really bumped my number of plays.

RATING: 7
Needs a modification, because the offense is more powerful than the defense, a particularly bad problem when the reverse was true in the ACW.  Either let infantry fire a one die defensive fire at any unit that moves toward it, or make infantry attacking lose one die if they move.
Think I have some extra battles for it.

I love this Civil War version of [gameid=10630] (actually predates it).  It needs a reprint badly, and I love this Commands and Colors system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the lightest and quickest of the Commands and Colors games, and there's nothing wrong with that.   The card mix has been improved in other games (like Ancients), and the leaders here don't do nearly as much as you might like them to, but it's still a good, quick, simple implementation of the system with nice colored plastic pieces.   Don't need to own it, but I'd probably pick this over Battle Lore or Memoir, but not before Ancients.

The blueprint of some games which are coming out today. For example Memoir'44.

I played this game after playing Memoir '44. One main difference between Battle Cry and Memoir '44 is that Battle Cry doesn't have player aids. The Memoir '44 player aids are very useful.

The only downside of game like Battle and Memoir '44, setup can be long and the game doesn't last very long.

First of the C&C series (before it was a series.) My boys cut their gaming teeth on this one. Fast play and great eye candy with mostly balanced scenarios (except for New Hope, which leaves you  "No Hope" as the North.) Adopted a couple of house rules: (1) Inability to retreat causes one casualty per flag instead of whole unit. (2) Eliminate "Hit & Run" cards on scenarios with no cavalry. Doesn't get the table love it used to but we pull it the first of every July and play a double board Gettysburg.

2015-08-10 : That system started of course with Battle Cry - I didn't own the game, but my buddy Phil did and one night he came over to my house to play it. This was from before he went to the US and I met the Eurogamer group.

So we played a game and my wife had been lurking and commenting on my moves and plays so I said to her : here, now you play Phil while I prepare dinner.

By that time Phil (and me) had been playing wargames for more than 20 years but he got slaughtered that evening by my wife who first feigned on one flank only then to strike on the other with everything but the kitchen sink.

Sure, there was some luck involved, but she's a natural and quiet aggressive player and he didn't expect that at all.

Almost perfect.  For a "fun n' grim" variant, try placing a glass bead or other marker in a hex for each figure killed there.  By the end you'll see all those glass beads spread across the board and experience that wargamer frisson: "ew, nasty, the vile wages of war" combined with "awesome!"

RATING: 4
I'm not a fan of the Command & Colors system. I find it insipid and uninspired. This system seems to be for people who don't like the stress of making difficult decisions when across from another player. While I understand what the system is attempting to do in terms of command-and-control, the result is that the cards severely limit your ability to act anywhere near realistically, and the dice affect what few decisions you have. It's about as realistic or interesting as checkers. 

This and Mem '44 are completely uninteresting to me; at least CC:A has some redeeming qualities with line movement and battle back.

[b]Richard Borg's light wargame; not quite as good as the others I've played (BattleLore; Memoir '44). As a game, it's decent; as a social issue (fighting as Confederates), I've always been a bit troubled and am finally trading it on those grounds.[/b]

:star: PROS:
- easy to teach
- battles are short
- nice figures
- modular map allows for lots of variability
- good historical battle scenarios

:nostar: CONS:
- needs variants to balance a few things (infantry; single unit activation)
- set-up a bit long
- Confederacy is a social issue for me that I can't overcome

After 15 plays. The varying types of terrain make it interesting strategy wise, and the agony of bad cards and bad dice rolls -- while frustrating -- feel like the fates of battles. Lots of luck, and, though light, still a wargame. Very fun though and my non-gamer friends have really taken to it. But there&#039;s luck. Lots and lots of it.

What a great theme for this weight of game.  A good intro wargame you can play with a kid and still get a dose of hand management and terrain usage.  Good looking as well- and I am not a plastic fan.  I think Ancients is the most evolved version of Command and Colors and to me Battle Cry feels like an early version of the system.  I would try Memoir or Ancients first, despite the cool Civil War theme.

Sort of fun, but certainly not a serious (war)game. Much too abstract and limited for a serious gamer. However, it plays fast, and if you lose just set up another scenario. While the minis certainly look nice, they make the game rather fiddly. Your setup time is half to a third as long as your play time in short scenarios. Some cards (All-Out Assault) are simply unbalancing. Oh well, it's not a serious game anyway.

Gene (aka Fireball) taught me how to play this at Gaming in the Woods in WA State and enjoyed it.  Was fun using an improvised set-up.  Gene conceded the game, but I think it was really a draw.

I love all the possibilities of this game, creating new hexes, scenarios, themes, rule variants etc.

The first of the C&C games to be published, but as of the end of 2010 the last one I tried.  I liked it.  The long but decreasing ranges of the infantry and artillery give a different feel to the game from the other implementations.  The two model cavalry also make them far more fragile than in other games, which feels right for the Civil War.  The combination made for a fun game that was just different enough from other C&C games.

An ok strategy game for 2-players.  Luck affects all of the game aspects though.  Many scenarios to play to keep the game interesting but the ability to apply tactics are limited by your cards.  You may only move units if you have the appropriate cards which can be infuriating and completely unecessary.  These cards do not simulate fog of war it's just a mechanism to drive the game... rather poorly.

Purchased this in 2001 and didn't enjoy it as much as expected.  After Memoir '44, gave it some additional plays and have really come to appreciate the game.  With inexperienced gamers and/or kids, I believe this is the best starting point for Commands and Colors games.

Great fun, even if your plans can be totally thwarted by a lack of cards on a given flank. Victory condition (6 flags) is very artificial in that it ignores geographical objectives, etc.

Nice, accessible introduction to wargames. Very illustrative thanks to the quite detailed miniatures. Reconstructing the historical battles with changing and historical conditions ànd in the correct order, is a nice way (and to me the only correct way) to play this game.

My introduction to the Commands and Colours series of games - the simple but elegant combination of command cards and combat mechanics give a very good tactical experience in just a short time allowing for multiple fun plays in a session. There is a considerable luck factor - in both the draw of the command cards (which determines the number of dice you can roll), and the outcome of the actual combat dice (the chances of a hit are high) - but the tactics of the battle is in managing these elements. Components are excellent. Very good Mr Borg!

Very fun; card play simulates the "fog of war" pretty well, frustrating attempts at a strategy.

RATING: 7
Its got plastic minatures.  Its got plenty of dice rolling.  Its got cardboard terrain.  Each player draws cards that provide a limited set of moves they can make on a given turn.  Battle Cry can be fun and fast (though set-up is not so fast) to play.  Luck figures in as to the winner more than strategy but there is some strategy there also.

Unbelievable!  Acquired Secret Santa 2008 - I'm very excited to have finally acquired and played the first game in the C&C system.  It's simpler than the follow up games, but has a fair eloquence about it.  (only 2 plays so far).  I'll post an updated rating and "review" when I get more plays in.  8 plays.  Fun Game, but doesn't quite feel like ACW. Still very very very happy to own it though!  My Secret Santa 2008 is the BEST!

RATING: 6
 Enjoyable, fast, and has a good back and forth flow. The game does a fair job of representing the difficulties of command control and attacking during the war, but the cards make strategy forming too restrictive and the infantry have insanely long shooting ranges that are not adjusted for the varying scale of the scenarios. The game does benefit from being modular, allowing you try out almost any situation from the war. I like this more than [i]Command and Colors: The Ancients[/i], but not as much as [i]Memoir '44[/i].
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More than any game I've ever played, it bridges the gaps between Eurogames, wargames, and American family-style games. Battle Cry deserves a place on most gamers' shelf because of its versatility and broad appeal.  I do recommend nerfing or removing the "All-Out Attack" a.k.a. "I Win!" card. 

**Update** Memoir '44 may have made Battle Cry obsolete in my collection.  Some of the improvements from M44 could be backported to Battle Cry, but others probably wouldn't be appropriate for the Civil War setting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a great quick light wargame. It's fun to play and has a tactical element that reminds me of a hybrid of a few wargames (SL, WTP...).  But it would be much better if there was a defensive return fire phase because unit movement is so slow.  

Later games in the series are much better now.

RATING: 6.5
For the hard core this is good but not great. If I wasn't a Civil War buff and if I hadn't invested the time to paint my pieces, I'd like it a bit less. Might have some success in attracting new wargamers, and I'd play it over Axis and Allies any day. 

It is notable mostly for being the publication debut of Borg's Commands and Colors system, which would go on to greater popularity in Memoir 44, Commands & Colors Ancients, and Battlelore (all of which are better games). I do still enjoy pulling this out to play with my youngest son -- the game is colorful and it gives us a chance to discuss history.

Requiring that infantry fire only before moving and limiting leader effects to ignoring flags restores a tolerable degree of ACW feel, and there are no end of variants out there that attempt to patch the game and make it more of a simulation. I happily play it without these elaborations. Over time I have come to accept and admire the game for what it is, rather than what I wished it to be, and my rating has gone up from first blush.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light war game with good historical integration. The strength of this game is that players don't have to be brilliant tacticians to win. The downside is that you don't have to be a brilliant tactician to win. The cards are certainly the controlling factor in the game. I sometimes found myself wanting to attack on my right flank but having no cards to allow me to do so. Even so, the game does play well for what it is. If you want to fully control every single army piece whenever you want, however, this game is not for you.

Kind of a pre-Memoir '44 battle system.  Interesting, but not really enrapturing.  Good, but more of a collectors items than an irreplacable game.

Cival war battles with fairly simple rules and good game flow. Terrain tiles allow the map board to be changed to an "infinite" number of variations. Movement/combat can only be done via cards; thus, luck is a large part of the game. The game comes with a good number of scenarios (15).

The CDG meets the Peter Principle. CDGs work better (at least in concept) as Strategic level games where a move is a MOVE.

Fix - allow players to use any two Activation cards of other areas to activate units of the desired area, use the value of only the lower of the two cards played, the second card is discarded, then draw two cards to refill hand.

What can I say.  I love this game and it's got me into a lot of other very fun games.  The card driven mechanism is a lot of fun.

Of all the C&C systems, this is my favorite. Why?  You might ask.  Well, that is because this isn't a deep system.  It's very simple and somewhat random.  I think the following versions just start to take away from the simplicity, which is it's core.

I'm a big fan of all the Commands & Colors games, but in many ways the stripped-down simplicity of this earliest one makes it the best choice to reach for when introducing the system to non-gamers.  Family members who are very casual in their gaming seem to fall in love with this one pretty easily.

Superb game! Miniatures, adjustable terrain, a bunch of scenarios, and card-driven mechanics - all make for an extremely fun gaming experience. Diehards for realism don't care for it, but if you are in the market for a "light" game covering American Civil War battles you can't go wrong with Battle Cry. Despite its simplicity, gives players a lot of flavor, with your infantry assaulting the enemy line, artillery pounding away and cavalry raiding and flanking your opponent's troops.

Players play cards to move their plastic soldiers around a customizable map.  Any relationship to actual Civil War combat is superficial, with the attacker firing before the defender being the best example of how no attempt is made whatsoever to model actual events.  Play seemed fun at first, but we quickly discovered how unbalanced the card deck is when, after trailing 0-5, I played the All-Out Offensive card and won 6-5.  There’s not really anything in this design that stands out in a positive way; I have a hard time believing anyone would be playing it if it didn't feature all of those plastic soldiers.  Still, it is quick and potentially fun, so I probably wouldn't refuse a game, although I'd always be inclined to recommend something else regardless of the audience.

What is real fun is to play a campaign game where you play all the scenerios as the north and then switch up and play all of them as the south. It takes a long time but it is real fun.

I am one of the few who played Memoir before I played this game.  This has everything I liked about Memoir, but for me holds more interest because of the civil war theme.  One of the largest changes is the addition of leader pieces which is a difference I enjoy.  

For many the cosmetic changes of memoir made it a superior game.  I agree that the Memoir card holders are nice but unlike many I like the rigid minis in this more than the super flexi ones from Memoir.

So far I also enjoy the scenarios in this one more. (Again this could be simply my greater interest in the civil war) 

I honestly don't think you can go wrong with either game.

This is a very light but excellent war themed game.  I'll categorize this as card-driven war themed fluff since it's based on war, is card driven, and is very light and easy to learn. Now that the system has been used in Memoir'44 and C&C: Ancients, I'd say that Battle Cry is no longer as great. I prefer the WWII theme of M'44 and the increased complexity of C&C: Ancients however Battle Cry still has it's place and is a nice change of pace. I've always meant to paint the minis however so many great games with awesome minis (ie. War of the Ring) have come out that painting these has fallen by the wayside.

Battle Cry simplifies combat while still retaining realism and offering a modest range of strategic and tactical options. The blend and play of cards is neat. I just couldn't get into it.

I usually have a competitive attitude playing most games, but with this (and Command & Color) I find myself just not caring. "OK, I'll move this group. Hope I hit you. OK. I did, once. Hope you don't hit me. Oh, you did. Twice. Ah, well." Since I see many like this game, perhaps it compares to the Simpsons' contrasting broadcasts (American English vs. Spanish) of a soccer(football) match. "he holds it.    he holds it.    he holds it."  vs. "HE HOLDS IT! HE HOLDS IT!! HE HOLDS IT!!!"

I could see playing again if in the mood of a light & lucky war game. (I won the game I played.)

If you love light wargames with historic flavor, this is the game for you. When you start to play you may think Battle Cry is simple and luck driven, but it got more depth than it seems at first. I really like how the rulebook draws you into the period of American Civil War. It explains the politics of the time and gives plenty of details for every battle. My only minor objection is line of sight rule for artillery. Sometimes its hard to be precise and you must use the ruler or something else to see if there is LOS. Suggestion: play all 15 battles as one campaign. Great game.

RATING: 7
A very cool civil war battle game. A wonderful system, very easy to pick up and teach, good variety.

I like the commands and colors system on whole and this was a wonderful beginning for me. I had no idea what this would be like when I bought it back in the day, but I'm very glad I got it on a whim at 50% off!

It's a pleasure to look at and to play.

I love the look of it, I like to see the abstractions of the battle fields and I strongly wish that Avalon Hill had not dropped it as I'd have loved expansions.

I look forward to trying Scrib's advanced version posted on the 'Geek as well.

I anticipate owning this for years.

*Update* It has slipped when compared with the newer Command and Colors games. Some wonderful options have been introduced in the later (newer) versions of the system. Battle Cry still plays quite well, but once you played with the newer systems, it does lack in comparison.

That said, it's still a damn cool game.

Battle Cry is an accessible light skirmish game, and a landmark innovation in terms of introducing the "command card" system. As someone not particularly into Civil War history, I didn't have high expectations; but I was pleasantly surprised by the tactics and mechanics in this title. The variable number of combat dice relative to the distance of the target is a strong element of the game, making movement and board position critical. While subsequent titles in the series improved on the foundation laid here, this is a well-designed, enjoyable game.

Fun system, as with all the other C&C games. This one seems the most straight forward. Leaders only affect the unit they are joined with, not the surrounding units as in C&C:A, so manouvering leaders is not as significant. Not a good or a bad thing. I enjoy all of these games about equally well.

RATING: 6
Easily the most simplistic and raw game in the C&C system. Infantry is ungodly in range and fire dice compared with the artillery. On the plus side the calvary feels about right but are likewise over-matched by the infantry.

Chris Farrell said it best:

"A modestly fun game that has been simply superseded by later, much superior games with the same system."

Easy to get into, quick to finish and more often than one would think it results in a tense gaming experience.  I don't know why people persist in rating it as a simulation, but I'll confess you shouldn't buy it thinking you'll get one.  Lots of extra scenarios available via the web, so you're not limited to what's in the box.  

Back in the day, I played every scenario in the box more than once.  These days, I'd probably play Clash for a Continent (Worthington) instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The weakest of the Commands & Colors series but still a good game. Due to the low variety in units and cards the gameplay is the least refined. But most important it just has been rendered obsolete by its successors. If I'm out for a quick game I'll go with Memoir, if I want something more meaty, CC:A is the choice. The only draw would be its Civil War theme but that's nothing I'm interested in.

RATING: 5
I feel like, when I win, I really didn't do anything, it's just luck. When I lose, I get frustrated, especially when I can't get the cards to move the pieces I want too. The double layer of luck, picking cards at random and rolling dice makes this a so-so game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This one is quite good, and I like the period better than any of the other current C&C games. You can see that this was the first in the series, though, given that it's neither as good looking as some of the others nor as polished rules wise. This could benefit from a new edition, which I'd probably still buy.

Recommend at least giving the move-2/move-1-and-fire option to infantry and not automatically eliminating units that retreat off the board.

My first exposure to Richard Borgs' game system. Loved it right off. Quick to set up and just as quick to play. Tons of scenarios in the box. Can be frustrating when the right cards don't come your way and that all out offensive is a killer but still, a great game and I love the theme.

Found it at a WOTC store for $20.  Enjoyed it so much, I bought a second copy.  I highly recommend doing that if you can - it adds a lot of flexibility.

Exciting, accessible, addictive 2-player battle game. If you want a game that eliminates luck altogether, it's not for you and it can be frustrating, but it's actually brilliantly weighted and (with a couple of minor rule adjustments to soften the crueller blows) is my #1 2-player battle game.

Pickett's charge. A couple of Confederate brigades approach the Union fortifications, shooting as they go. Suddenly, the Yanks all let up a howl and spill into the field. After they've run forward and taken their shots at the surprised attackers, they are cut down by massive Confederate artillery bombardment. Perhaps a little rattled by what just happened, everyone goes back to taking potshots at each other. But then the Union soldiers are gripped with another bout of battle frenzy and their ranks all move forward, firing as they go. Unfortunately for them, their first few shots drive the Rebel avantgarde backward so that they are suddenly out of range. The Confederates then counterattack by running up and shooting at select Union brigades and taking their flags. Shaken, the Union troops break rank and flee or surrender en masse or something. Who even knows.

This is a good introductory game in that it has concepts like ranged fire and line-of-site that you'll see in many other tactical wargames.  However, it lacks historical flavor.  For example, in one playing of Bull Run scenario, Union cavalry rode circles around confederates because all units are equal and are activated by cards.  In reality, the USA cavalry was not the equal of the confederates until 1863.

An absolute blast to play.  It's not a serious simulation of ACW combat.  I own 4 copies so that large battles can be played.  The game, while really interesting at the time, hasn't aged well--the more recent Commands & Colors have added new and interesting mechanics.  Battle Cry 150 clarified some rules and changes some cards, but the basic rules are still the same.

Can be a lot of fun. Great for homeschooling and teaching the basic of specific battles. A lot more fun if you can do the 'league' by playing multiple battles.

I did not find this game to be all that compelling having already played Memoir '44.  Battlecry is much more simpler a game than Memoir '44 outside of the impact and use of the generals in the game.  I really feel no need to have both and prefer Memoir '44 due to expandability and increased complexity.  As well, Command and Colors is much better than Memoir!  Why keep a game that is a couple levels below the favorite and is somewhat similar?

RATING: 7
A simple and abstract tactical level game on the American Civil War.  The concept of flanking movement, the division on the fronts into right, left and center, different characterisitcs on the types of armies (cavalry, infantry, cannon), the use of leaders (bonus DRM) etc. are nicely integrated in a dice rolling combat resolution and strategy cards combo.  Luck factor comes in more than historcially true.  As a simple introductory game to non-wargamers and for tournament event or club competitive play, this could simply be the best choice.     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice game, although I was quite bored after a couple of times.
Some cards have too much power and are unbalanced, most of the these cards decided the outcome of the game...

So we played with our own rules to make the game more balanced...

Rating would be higher if I hadn't gotten burned out on playing it. Even still, it's probably REALLY an 8 (but I have a hard time with the definition provided for the '8') IMO a FAR superior game to Memoir 44 -- the cards seem less powerful, which means strategy comes into play more.

Similar gaming style to Command and Colors. I acquired this game when my kids were still young enough to play games with their dear old dad. My 13-year-old daughter was the only one who liked the game, so we were the only two who played it.

Didn't survive the move and now I am sorry because I met people with whom I play Command and Colors and this game would be an enjoyable alternative to Ancients all the time.

Simple war game, but very fun.  There is a large luck factor, but plenty of strategy as well.  Lots of different scenarios to play, some are unbalanced but can play both sides of the board. Don't like the "All out offensive card" because its too powerful, so we reduced its effect. Only rule that is difficult at first is the line of sight.

A light tactical battle game with a Civil War theme.  You setup North and South and have infantry, cavalry and artillery.  You play cards to maneuver and attack an enemy.

Light and simple enough for families.  It does have an all out assault card which unbalances the game.  You can take this out.

A very good and relatively simple tactical battle system.  I think if you could pair it with a strategic level game like A House Divided, you might really have something.  Downside is the lack of balance to the scenarios, forcing two plays if you care enough.

I don't like the command cards structure of this game.  You can have an overwhelming force on one section of a map, but can do nothing but sit and watch as a force 1/4th it's size beats the stuffing out of your troops because you can't draw up a single card that lets you activate units on that map portion.

great game from designer of Memoir '44 - can play twice in an hour  - switching sides.  elegant system  - only gripes are that a bigger map would allow for more maneuver  - and I really don't understand the detaching and killing of the leaders - but it is still great.

Very very fun game of US Civil War battles.  Not a simulation, but it somehow captures the tension and struggle of war games very effectively. I prefer this to Memoir '44 (also a very good game) just because I think the card system fits this era better.  I'm looking forward to "Command and Colors: Ancients".

After playing "Clash for a Continent", I've lowered my rating to 7.  While I still enjoy this game, I prefer the action point system and some of the optional rules in CfaC.  I have, however, experimented with playing out the orders cards in "Battle Cry" 3 turns ahead, and it was a very tense game.

3 / 5 - Good

Given that I came to this *after* playing its big brothers C&C:A and M44, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. The various units behave differently to their WWII and ancients counterparts, they feel right and require different tactics to handle properly. The deck has some unusual cards too, and to top it all off the scenarios seem very well designed.

First couple of games were great, but the most recent one was less good. Pales a bit compared to later games in the series. The problem is that the victory conditions only account for killing enemy units, and when you close you get hammered by defensive fire, and lose. So, there is no incentive to advance. Really needs some sort of terrain VPs to encourage someone to DO something. [Update] The ABCDE modified rules make this a lot more fun, and I've even incorporated a few ideas from other BC players. Definitely better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Amid the many Civil War games out there, at last a fun and easy to play 'simulation' of that war. Despite some of the critics' claims that the game is to much card-driven, the various scenarios play out well, with the outcomes pretty much mirroring the historical results. Underneath the seeming easy setup and game play, there is a lot of tactical decisions to be made (yes, even with the cards dictating some of the events). Artillery (as it was in real life) is king, and units in good defensive terrain (again, as it was in real life) can maintain a position for a good time.

RATING: 5.5
This is a beautiful game with amazing components. A great entry into wargames using a card driven system. The game replicates the battles of the civil war with many scenarios both in the rule book and online. My second play, I had a terrible hand and that can be quite frustrating as I knew the game was over by the 5th round. Despite having a terrain advantage, I lost very, very quickly. The luck of the cards and dice can be frustrating when you know that a lucky pick or roll will turn the tides (and you know no luck is coming!). Despite some bad luck and many newb mistakes, the game is fun and easy to understand. I am a terrible wargamer and would probably only play this when in the mood, but it is a very good intro for someone like me, despite my lack of skill. I look forward to playing again to see if I can decrease the luck factor as I become more competent at the game.

As a long standing grognard and Civil War buff who just doesn't have the time or desire to work through tougher and deeper simulations very often, this game really hits the sweet spot for enough of flavor and easy mechanics so you can actually play the game. Will you gain historical insight? No but you will have fun. Luck? Yep but lucky generals tend to win battles and wars. So if you accept the game for what it tries to do, i.e. be a game you can actually play as opposed to working through a simulation, you will love this game.

The first of the Richard Borg Commands and Colors system, and the simplest.  While the primary emphasis is on attrition and capturing 6 flags from a side, the basic feel of the Civil War is captured.  During one of the first games I played (vs. my wife), I commented on how bloody the game was.  My wife stared at me and said, "Hello?  This IS the Civil War, you know."

Unlike some people who have said that they liked the later C&C games so much that they don't go back to Battle Cry, I've found that I still like to play the game.  This game makes for a good introductory wargame for children.

I'm curious about trying the ABCDE rules adjustments to Battle Cry to see if the changes provide a better Civil War feel.  If I get the chance to do so, it may impact the rating here.

Simple...Fast...Fun...Luck filled. Those are just some of the words used to describe Battle Cry and I would concur with them all. While there is a good dollop of luck in the game based on the draw of the cards...there is still room for tactics and the games are quick enough that losses due to very unlucky dice rolls or crappy card draws are soon wiped from memory...besides revenge is sweet...another game?  The plethora of scenarios also contributes to the replay value and another advantage is that the game really appeals to many children because of the nice components. Also a surprisingly good filler with non-gamers as you don't have to be a grognard to understand this light battle game.

When I lived in Austin I got to play Memoir'44. I really enjoy Richard Borg's work and in another life, I got to sit down and play Battle Cry with Borg at Gencon in 1999. It was fantastic. There is a lot here to work with when it gets down to it. Choice, unit type, it's all here in this neat little package.

After playing Memoir '44, this game feels a little clunky. It doesn't flow as well as Memoir, and the limited movement of the infantry makes for a slower, more plodding game. Still, it's loads of fun and you get a nice sense of fighting a battle and the heavy luck factors seem to add excitement rather than be a detriment.

My very first war game (unless you count Stratego).  First saw it played at a convention in Baltimore in 1999 where there was a Battle Cry tournament (there may have been more than 200 games going on at the same time).  Had to have it; bought it right there at the convention. Now have multiple copies to play "Big Battle Cry".

RATING: 9
'All is as it was, except this time YOU are in command!'  I love this game!  First of all, I guess I'd better explain that I've been interested in the American Civil War (ACW) since seeing Ken Burns' excellent documentary many years ago.  I have wargame rules and miniatures, DVDs, CDs, movies and books on the subject.  Battle Cry is another way for me to enjoy experiencing this part of history.  The game is easy to learn, fun to set up (yes, even though it takes a little while), great visual appeal, there are tactical decisions to make, you get to refight historic battles - what more can you ask for?  My friend and I played the entire 15 battle campaign over several months.  I played the Union and he played the Confederates.  We went into the final game with me on a total of 64 flags and he with a total of 63 flags.  1 flag difference after 14 battles.  The last battle of the campaign would decide the war.  He won the battle 6 flags to my 3 and won the war 69 flags to my 67. It was a thrilling end to a campaign in which the lead often changed.  We look forward to swapping sides and playing the full campaign again sometime.  I bought this game new and it has been worth every cent.  Hope to pick up another copy one day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I think this is a fun game to play with its card-driven mechanism and the battle field devided in a center and two flanks. The modular system is clever (main board portrays open ground and obstacles are handled with thick cardboard counters). Combat is executed in a simple fashion, with the special dies. Each battle scenario lasts one hour at most (very often less). That is why I will play Battle Cry often. But... why do I get the feeling that ACW, that is a strategic game, has a more accurate depiction of a civil war battle in its mini-game, than this tactical game has? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great early implementation of the C&C system. Sometimes remembering all the rules and exceptions to Ancients and the like can be a bother, plus the Civil War theme works great with the system. A real winner with a great sense of what it wants to be.

Fantastic game! Between this, M44 and Battlelore, I got around to playing this one last for some reason.  This is the oldest and yet it really holds its own with the others. Game is balanced well, considerate of warfare type. Considerable attrition of soldiers here.  Plays substantially different from the other two that will make me want to play this one again and again.  Generals were a definate addition to this game. 

On separate note, no color blind issues here for me like in M44. Blue and Grey are much more easy to pick out on the board, even in low lighting.

This game is already quite old. You can actually see where Memoir and Ancients separated from the game. All in all it's a bit outworn and dull compared to the others. The system is still fun though!

Generals add a nice flavor to the game and increase the odds. It's just too hard to kill them compared to the Ancients for example.

Surely I'd prefer the newer ones but there's nothing wrong in this either!

Handsome game. Any game with plastic soldiers is on its way to being a good game. Because BC is quick and tactical (not strategic however like VINCI or History of the World) it gets good marks. BONUS: tons of expansion battles and tiles can be downloaded from several web sites. I have researched several smaller battles and recreated them for BC plus bought plastic Sioux warriors and created Battle of Little Big Horn. 
UPDATE: I have knocked this game down a few point in light of Memoir 44 which is a 10 for what it brings. This game becomes a 7 in comparison

Similar to many miniature games with a variable board that allows players to try a variety of battles. None of the battles feel historical so the board is little more than eye candy. Many of the scenarios are unbalanced (an attempt to be historical?). The killer for me was that the card draws determined much of what a player could do - draw poorly and you may not be able to move troops. This is not a good wargame. However, the multi-board games bring out the best in this game. There is time and space for development and the card draws, though still a problem at times, are less influential. There is even a better 'historical feel' to the multi-board games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fast, fun, easy to play. Lots of replay value due to the LARGE random component introduced by the cards. That random element is too strong for this to be a seriously competitive game, the movement rate for Infantry should be 2 to make the firing ranges seem more consistent, and it can also be a bit gamey trying to keep some units on the sector dividing lines so that they can go either Flank or Center. All-in-all, almost more of a 'toy' than a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice simple game. Good to get kids and newbies into wargames. 
I like the fact of the card hands - you have to plan ahead with your units to make sure you can follow through, with your attacks.
I use 2 house rules:
Some objective hexes (I use extra flags) which equal the loss of a flag bearer. It does encourage the historical attacker to attack. 
Units should fire then move, removes a small bit of the attackers advantage.

However to get this to an outstanding game use the rule for advanced battle cry by Scribidus - an outstanding effort.

I very much enjoy Battle Cry. Its fun, quick and easy to play which makes it the perfect game for introducing new people to war games. The basic jist of the game is that the two players take turns playing command cards that allow them to move, and attack the enemy. Once you have eliminated 6 enemy units flag beraring units you win. There are four unit types (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Leaders) and various terrain markers to give the game a tactical flavour. The typical game can be set up and played in about 1.5 hours. Serious simulation type gamers will be turned off by the high luck factor, but casual gamers will love it.

great Command and Colors system game by Richard Borg. I absolutely love this system of games, much like Memoir 44, the game play is fast paced, real and biting with lots of tough decisions to be made when you are unable to order units on one part of the field, great mechanics, and great minis

I'd probably go for this before Battlelore or Memoir. It's silly, but so is the system. Fast paced, insanely bloody, uncomplicated. And it suits the Civil War period. AND it is fast to set up. Yes, it needs house rules, but I'm a fan.

If you've ever read that this game takes forever to get ready to play, they were right.  It had to have taken at least an hour and a half to clip out all the units and put on all of the stickers.  The time was worth it though.  The manual creates a great sense of the battle and the units and board just look great.  Its definitely better if played quickly like the designer intended.  If not, it starts to bog down.  Definitely transcends between Eurogames and wargames.  Had to increase this to a nine.  It seems to me the perfect game for a quick battle.

You know, I'm not sure why I keep buying Commands & Colors games. Sure, I like them but nobody else I know does. Probably, it was the Civil War theme that reeled me in on this one, as the Civil War is one of my favorite topics in American history.

As for the game? It's fun, but it will be infinitely more interesting if you're into the theme. It is not a heavy, historically accurate war game with advanced logistical mechanics and deep tactical considerations. It's a quick, dirty little war game with enormous swings of luck. Tactics and strategy matter but you're still at the whims of the very fickle dice. Oh, and the flag stickers? They're awful, use a drop of superglue to secure them unless you want to be constantly pulling and pressing them back into position.

The game is ready to play: all pieces are punched, stickers on dice, flags attached. All cards are protected in single card plastic sleeves.
 
Four homemade, wooden card holders included.

Box has some wear on edges. Each end has a 2"x1" white sticker attached with a capital letter written on it.

Interior black, cardboard riser is gone. Rulebook cover is minorly scuffed.

I used to host Battle Cry tournaments, so I have multiple copies, if that interests you.

An excellent game but game mechanic does not do an adequate simulation of the CSA  or Union armies. There is no advanced game. Mechanic is a combination of rock-paper-scissors and luck.

RATING: 6.5
A good introduction to wargaming.  We play that the all out attack card is an all out move card (all units can move but not fire).  This helps get the people into the fight, but reduces the overwhelming power of that one card.  The problem with this game is that often the first person to move dies so there is a tendency for smart commanders to play it cautious.

RATING: 8.5
A very fun Civil War reenactment- a lot of dice rolling, not as good as BattleLore.  It's a little different- Battle Cry takes into account the exact number of spaces your unit is from the enemy during combat, BattleLore does not- just if it's in range and whether it's melee or ranged combat.  They're both game systems.

A good "beer & pretzel" war game.  I really like the miniatures, which is usually the case with an Eagle game, and it's nice to see the board set up with the pieces' flags flying.  The "cool" factor is high.  It's basically card driven, as your strategy depends on what cards you hold in your hand.  It's the same system as Memoir 44, but from what I've read, Memoir 44 improved some of the mechanics which drag Battle Cry down a bit.

A wargame for the busy professional who's always on the run.  I'm not really the wargaming type, but this one I can appreciate.  The 'fog of war' effect is handled very nicely for such a short game--you will feel frustrated as your troops sit like chickens in the line of fire, or suddenly rush and rampage from the throes of death. I think the game could use a bit of tinkering personally--the cavalry seems to be pretty much worthless, for example.  Apparently others agree with me as there is a wealth of variants to this game.  Which just goes to show you how much people like it.

Can't help but compare this to Memoir'44, which my group got at the same time. I think it's a bit more fun than Memoir. Artillery is modeled perfectly in this game system. It's a good time, and has a quick turnaround.

Upped my rating after a few plays under my belt. As stated by others here. I think the CDW system used here works well for the Civil War era. It makes movement much more critical as units can get wiped out in a hurry. Includes leaders which help in combat and good mix of cards. 
A very well done 2 player game.. and it looks nice.

RATING: 8.5
If I'm only rating for the fun factor, this game gets a 10. A complete blast. Played both Sides of Bull Run and Gaines Mill. There seems to be a few balancing issues with the cards, in particular, all out offensive is a complete game changer. Dead hands also seem like a common occurrence. I believe these issues have been fixed by 150th anniversary edition and more recent entries into the command series. The game components are gorgeous: great high-quality miniatures, attractive map and terrain hexes, hefty dice, and some decent iconography on the cards. Overall, a great introduction to the works of Richard Borg.

Played another set of scenarios with a variant that fixes the dead card problem, and tones down the incredibly overpowered all out offensive. The added balance is a plus, and I enjoyed it all the more. bumped my rating up.

I enjoyed my many plays of this game (and Memoir '44), but became tired of the system.  Sometimes the luck of the card draw would mean that I couldn't move my troops in one sector of the battlefield and I'd get slaughtered.  There are simply other, better games that I'd prefer to play.

RATING: 3
A fundamentally flawed game, primarily because of the deck. The historica presentation is rather vague, so you don't get a real feel for civil war combat, but my biggest complaint is that the deck suffers from a tendency to imbalance itself. If one player happens to acquire the majority of 'center' cards, the other side can do nothing in center, and so he just sits there watching the other player attack.

Overly rigid game, I thought.

RATING: 4
I don't like plastic figures in board wargames: ugly and actually less useful than counters (if you have nice big hexes) (and I'm a miniatures gamer). Also not a fan of card dictated tactics (& especially telling me what part of the board I can take my action in.) Personally I find it thematically unconvincing.

 I do not like the fact that poor card draws can leave your troops defenseless. I had a few games where poor draws left one part of the battlefield with no activations. Very unrealistic that they can be shot and die, but will never fire in defense, until you draw the right card. Sold one copy, traded another. Neat idea that seems to have implemented better in Memoir '44 and even better in Command & Colors Ancients.

I see BC as a very attactive and simple battle game dressed up in Civil War clothing but not a very Civil War-like game. My small circle of gray bearded war game grognards who will play it and another small group of otherwise non-gaming Civil War History buffs don't get the right historical vibe as published. The last time I played it straight and my regular opponent suggested that next time we just line up the minis and roll dice until some body wins. It seems the bloom is off the rose. It could have done just a little better job of touching on the historical touchy feely things out of the box. If it were not so pliable as a game engine I would have dropped it by .5 since it is easily massaged into a more historical game if one wants to accept longer playing times and modest increase in complexity. I tried to tread the fine line that would make my Civil War History buff friend happy and my gamer friend and think I have succeeded with my ABCDE 2.0 Rules set. I did post my variant rules. Had M'44 been available first I would've bought it and passed on this one. Columbia's Dixie: Bull Run is a better ACW game and just as simple.

Of course, many of the engagements are not balanced and there are no balancing rules (other than players swapping sides for a second game).  Still, it is a fun game to play.  I like the theme as well.  It gives us non-wargamers an interesting US Civil War game that can be played relatively easily and quickly.  [03/13/2011]

I'm not a wargamer, so my opinion is slanted. Still, I think the game is not that interesting to wargamers, since it is so simplified, and therefore frustrating - additional rule complications posted to the geek may alleviate that. The figures and presentation are nice, however.

As for Eurogamers, this is a wargame - move your figures and roll dice. Generally the first one to move within range gets first shot, and is then vulnerable to return fire. That's about it.

Nice figures, variable board, some interesting tactical limitations make it marginally more enjoyable than other dice rollers.

[156 plays] We almost wore out a copy of this game the first year. It was like nothing we'd seen before. It still hits the table with regularity. This is not a deep wargame, and there's nothing wrong with that. Playing this game is a little bit like a dream where you are a bit self-aware and can manipulate events, but not with complete control.

Command and colors card system with a 3 section battlefield makes more sense historically with this Civil War theme than it does for the WWII theme of Memoir '44. A couple of optional rules that mitigate bad card draws and allow for more movement are helpful.

Most recent plays July '13.

The C&C system is a cross between M'44 and Ancients.

In comparison with M'44, I think that the battles play out differently (more static as troops move slower) which makes M'44 fans not like this one.

There's still a good amount of tension and historical flavour.

AH production quality is excellent. The rulebook could have been better laid out. DoW has done a great job with the M'44 rules.

Fun game - who would have imagined that from such a simplisic looking game that you can get so involved in the battle.

I find generally tactics still override the luck that this brings to the game.

Terrific civil war game with my favorite war system of all time.  I had already discovered Memoir and Battlelore before BC, and I would place this one right in the middle of them as far as enjoyment goes.  The generals are a neat touch, and the weapons are all very realistic as far as their stats and strategy.  Love that the infantry is so powerful (and rightly so).  Really, there's not much different here than with the new updated version, so I went ahead and bought this one for a great deal.

Fun and easy: just make sure you (1) limit the all-out-attack card and (2) strengthen the weakest (skirmish, I believe) card by letting players attack with one unit anywhere. The simplest (and funest) of this series of games. (Commands & Colors is the other of this series I'd recommend.)

Enjoyable quick playing battles although having already been playing Memoir 44 for a while it seems a 'little less'. 

It is amusing however to see other people coming up with advanced rules for a game that has been designed to be a light diversion.

Very enjoyable game, although currently I'm playing Memoir '44 a lot more than this one.

RATING: 5
Interesting gameplay, and if I were into the Civil War, it might get a higher rating. This game has many problems (over-powered units, inability to do anything at all in many situations) that Memoir `44 fixes and improves upon.

It's okay, but, but why play it when Memoir is available?

RATING: 8
I rather enjoy this game.  I think this is due to five main factors: other than Nexus Ops, it is the closest thing to a two-player war game that my wife will play with me on a regular basis, it is simple yet fun to play, it is well produced, it has an endless variety of possible scenario options, and it has little plastic soldiers (pretty much any game that has little plastic figures gives me the Warm Fuzzies).  My chief complaint with it is that, from the cards you draw to the results of the die rolls, this game is heavily luck dependent.  There is nothing more frustrating than taking an early lead due to a clever and successfully implemented strategy, only to be confounded by a hand-full of useless cards and poor die rolls.  But I guess that's the price you pay for simplicity of play.  For those who would like to throw a few more fun elements into the game play, I strongly suggest including the advanced rules that add special rules for units that have sustained casualties, taking ground, movement of generals, etc., that can be found in the "Files" section (check out user "scribidinus").  I should also note that I've also played "BattleLore" and "Memoir '44" (now, if C&C:A had come out with little plastic miniatures instead of hundreds of wooden blocks and stickers, that would very likely have been a different story - see my "Warm Fuzzies" comment above), so these improved systems might taint my opinion of "Battle Cry" ever so slightly.  In fact, I traded away this game after a buddy bought me "BattleLore" for my birthday.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

Simple to learn, simpler to teach, reminds me of all the best bits of being 12 years old, with enough strategy and luck so that if you win you can tell yourself it was down to your being as good as Napoleon and if you lose you can blame it on the luck of the draw. Never had a boring game of this.

Easy to learn and play game.  The combat system is simple and keeps the game moving.  However, combat is very'dicey' and also depends on the card draw.  Game length is short and game allows for only two players.  The components are of excellent quality.

I love this game! There's been a lot of criticism of it being a second sister of Memoir '44 but, hey, they didn't have strafing runs in the ACW. Lots of plays with my son who has abysmal luck with his draws.

RATING: 7
The first implementation of the great C&C system. If you love the theme and prefer this over Memoir'44, I recommend to use the house rules. So, even with some minor flaws, this one was an innovative system for me at that time.

Memoir'44 implemented most of these house rules and I can say the game improved very well, especially in the scenarios wide variety.

A fair war game but fails in two respects for me. I have no interest in the American Civil War and the car draw element is too random. It works for me if I play with the same fixed deck as my opponent.

RATING: 6
The rule book could have had a little more information. Even though this is a fairly simple game, it could be much better. Field works can only be installed with a card, end of turn, for example. Also, I don't care for being isolated from battle if a player doesn't have a card for a certain section of the battle field. Maybe I am behind in rules, but to me it seems extreme not to be able to move into an action that is within range of gun fire. There are probably some command  and control  rules I don't know about. It would be very interesting to have 2-4 games combined for a large engagement,  but not the way the rules are at present. A 6 rating is very generous  IMO for these reasons. I do enjoy playing it however. A fun beer and pretzel game.

RATING: 8
I must say, this is a very good FUN game.  Please keep in mind the word "fun".  Its not a very in-depth game and there is some dice and luck involved (almost all games have this to some degree).  However, it is nicely done and very simple to learn.  It's a light wargame.  This is one of the two games (Memoir '44 being the other) that I use to try to get people who have never played wargames into playing them.  If it were to be rated only on its merits, I'd rate it b/w a 6 or 7.....but because it is a great stepping stone for new players into better and more in-depth games, I've gotta give it an 8.

The most rules-light of the Commands & Colors series of wargames and probably the most luck heavy. Battle Cry does a nice job of simulating Civil War battles with a minimum of rules, and you can play in game in 45 minutes, which lends itself well to playing multiple scenarios in an evening, and swapping sides with your opponent to play both North and South. Lots of fun.

Having played a number of scenarios, I've decided that this system plays very well with the Civil War. Things are a bit slower than Memoir, but things just seem to make more sense in matching the era. This version of the system is a perfect match for this game. There is one downfall - the "I win card" that lets you order all units.

RATING: 5
A gaming buddy of mine has all of Richard Borg's series of games (Battle Cry, Memoir '44, Command & Colours, and BattleLore), and initially I was keen to play them: the rules are fairly simple, they play quickly (about an hour for a single scenario), and they look beautiful.  After several plays, however, I've soured on them somewhat.  I like the command and control through cards option in principle, but together with the way the dice are implemented, the luck is so wild, that I find that there's practically very little strategy involved at all.

Update for clarity: by this comment I meant to communicate that while I feel that there are certainly decisions to be made, and that better choices can produce better results, I rarely feel that their effects aren't overwhelmed by the relative good or bad fortune of each side's card draws and die rolls.

The fact that the victory conditions aren't adjusted to the scenario balance doesn't help either (yes, you can play the same scenario again and switch sides, but then the quick play time of about an hour is suddenly much less quick).  I still enjoy these games in small doses, but they fall through the cracks to some extent, because to my mind they are really 'filler' games, but if there's enough time to do them properly, there's enough time to play more interesting, and better, games.  The whole series strikes me as quite overrated in the boardgamegeek rankings.

Battle Cry, the first game of this system, is probably the most simple, and least interesting, to play.

Update: On reflection, I was probably too hard on these games with my initial ratings, so I've upped them a bit.  Even my initial rating and comments weren't meant to indicate that I didn't like them or wouldn't play them - I do enjoy them, and will happily play them from time to time - but none of them really grab me.

RATING: 7
Seems many folks have moved on to the more complex Commands & Colors, Memoir '44 and Battlelore, but I actually think Battle Cry holds up well even today. Sure, your options can be very limited based on cards in hand, but usually that's the fun of the game - making the most of limited options. Only an unusually terrible hand of cards can really spoil a game - rare in my experience. Battle Cry trades some realism and player control for simplicity and speed, which is OK in my book. The games is certainly one of the best for capturing the Civil War histoic flavor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great Game!  I love all the plastic figurines that make up the infantry, cavalry and cannons.  Great use of battle cards for limiting movement and attacks and clever custom dice system for resolving battles.  Over the years I just keep coming back to this as one of my favorite war games ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After one play I really liked it. I am a fan of the C&C system. Being the first one in the system, I could definitely tell it had some kinks that were worked out in Memoir, like the power level of some of the cards. I did find a site with some fixes for these problems. I'd say overall I prefer this one over Memoir. I need to play more to give it a better rating. I like the look & feel of this one over memoir. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first of the Commands & Colors, and this offers some of the best of what the series offers -- fast play, tough decisions, and lots of eye-catching plastic figures. The gameplay has been polished and improved in the newer games in the series, but this one is still strong.

Okay game, but nothing special.  The rules really don't come together to form something great.  I like card mechanics in general but this is the worst execution I've seen.  It doesn't enhance much and the constraints on the player seem artificial.  Still, a reasonably entertaining game.

The Game that hooked me into C&C system
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Purchased in VT flood relief auction. 

Not as strong (or historically interesting) as C&C: Ancients or M'44.  But it's the elder brother of those two designs and still manages to be fun.  While I miss the greater options and nuance of the later iterations of the system, this is still a fun way to spend an hour or so.

I do wonder about the balance of some of the scenarios, as in my limited experience the player on defense has a big advantage unless he gets bludgeoned by a bad hand.  It seems hard to win against a treeline or ridge infested with enemy infantry.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great 2 player Civil War game. Like all C&C games, it plays quickly, has solid, easy to understand rules, and has good components. Since its release, several newer Command and Colors games have been released that make Battle Cry seem a bit clumsy, forcing me to drop the score a bit. Fortunately, by taking a few ideas from the other C&C games, Battle Cry is still an excellent game. Some of the variants here on the geek have some great ideas for using some of the C&C Ancients Rules that really breathe some life into this slightly aging game. With the "C&C Ancients" variants, I'd rate the game an 8.

After several plays, Battlecry is really similar to Battlelore in terms of mechanic. I do like Battlecry since this is the first in the series of Richard Borg's card driven war game. I do like Battlelore more than Battlecry though. However, that being said, I wish battlelore had leaders and generals in the game. I particularly like the fact that generals can travel alone or split up from the main group. Losing a general is painful. Not sure about artillery. They are quite powerful. Solid.

I was checking out a relatively local game store (Gamez) for the first time, and they had a copy of this on the shelf for $40.  This has been out of print for a while now and the price is going up.  I hate to admit it, but that was a big factor in my decision to buy the game.  I generally only buy games I want to play, and while I am pretty sure I would enjoy this game, I already have Memoir 44, and if it wasn't for the rarity, I probably wouldn't have felt the need to buy it.  It is the only game I have (Terri's games excluded) that I don't plan to open, and I feel a touch guilty about buying a game like that.  Still, if the right opportunity comes along to play it, I will open it in a heartbeat.  If I never play it, and the price gets crazy, then maybe I will sell it in a few years.

Ugh!  The game has about as much to do with the Civil War as checkers, except that in checkers, you can choose which pieces to move.  No historical reality, small units taking down larger forces, no accounting for an objective other than "point and shoot."  Thank God I didn't pay $100 for it and got to try it instead!

Not a war game, not even close.  If this is what Memoir 44 is like, I'll pass.

Battle Cry is a civil war wargame that uses the very popular command and colors system. If you like that system, you'll like Battle Cry. It has a long list of scenarios that are suppose to mimic certain battles during the civil war and you play all of these through a campaign. Not all of them are balanced, but it's suppose to be like that (because not all battles in the civil war were balanced). I am pretty luke warm on the commands and colors system so I only thought this game was alright. My favorite part of the game is probably the history aspect of it.

I have played this many times and still enjoy it as much as the first time.  I have only one mild annoyance with the game - the retreat off the back edge. I believe the rule treatment in Memoir 44 (a casualty for each retreat) is a better option.  It is still an excellent game.

Great speedy war game with clear rules and that innovative card play. May seem uneven due to the luck of the draw and if you play single scenarios. Takes less time to set up than the overrated Axis and Allies. Just wish the pieces were sturdier.

One of the first games I pull our when introducing potential wargamers into the wonderful realm of historical based games.  This is Borg's easiest rules system, yet one must take masterful care in committing troops wisely, or the fate of the Union, or the Confederacy, as you choose, may well be jeapordized.  If you're interested in the Civil War, this is a great place to start.

My favorite Beer &amp; Pretzels game ever!  Lots of people don&#039;t like the luck factor even though some strategy is involved, but if you love to calculate odds and then roll the dice in war games, battle cry is for you!

When it comes down to it, I like the idea of being able to play any one of 12 different Civil War battles quickly.  And as a shoot-em-up.  It's simply a good time.

And I can actually entice normal, decent people to play this one with me.  Big points for that.

Absolutely fantastic board game.  Uncomplicated to play, enjoyable to set up. The rules are straightforward and allow some great customization to tailor the game to your preferred style.

A light and quick game, but a lot of fun and interesting.  Heavy luck element, but if you know that you could lose because of factors beyond your control (like in real life really), such as not having the right cards, then you won't take to too seriously and just get on and enjoy it.  Interesting to try and work with the resources you have (men and cards).

The first Richard Borg design I played utilizing the Command & Colors system (not sure if this was his first).  It is still one of my favorites.  Not too many little rules or fiddly things to keep track of.  Just brilliant simplicity.  Also, the theme fits the design well.

When Battle Cry was first released, it quickly became my favorite wargame. While I have outgrown it a bit, I've always felt that Richard Borg's command and colors card system did a great job of simulating the difficulties of battlefield communication in the pre-radio era. Bad generals have few cards, leading to more isolated units and paralyzed battle lines. Better generals get more cards and have more options as a result.

A run of bad card draws can make the game difficult, but generally the deck is balanced enough that this doesn't happen often. Careful players can overcome a bad hand and players who rush into battle will lose, almost every time. 

The game captures most parts of the Civil War battlefield well, but there are still some aspects that don't feel quite right. For instance, there are no rules in place to encourage battle lines, and the attack ranges of both the infantry and cannons feel way off. (Too long and far too accurate.) Combat is simplistic, especially when compared to newer incarnations of the C&C system. There are no unit special abilities, no milling through the command deck with probe orders, and no morale rules. Generals simply add a battle die to attacking units, and cavalry lacks pursuit actions. This simplicity makes the game a bit unsatisfying to a seasoned gamer, but it is still a great introduction to the C&C series.

What Battle Cry needs is a second edition. If it was redesigned with a little more depth it could easily give Memoir '44 a run for its money. I already house rule in battle-back rules, pursuits, taking ground, and leader morale boosts (all taken from later C&C games) and it works great. I would just prefer to have something a little more official.

UPDATE: 2nd edition coming soon from WOTC!!!

Very well designed game that is not only easy to learn but fun to play! High quality pieces, super card play and fun dice action makes this a real winner. Looking for a 2 player game? Give this a try- you'll come back for more. Lots of replay here!

Enjoy this game very much. The command cards makes it very interesting. Different scenarios included in the game and on the internet gives a high replay factor. I don't like to play Risk, the dice turn me off. The dice used in Battle Cry don't have that 'repeat' syndrome and 'luck' factor as in Risk. Played some fine games with my brother-in-law!

Finally got hold of a copy (been looking for ages) of this prequal to memoire '44 it plays very bloody and the bits are very good, The figures themselves are made of a solid plastic that would be easier to paint onto than the softer varity that most figures seem to be made of. The rules are solid but simple and easy to play and understand. Quick to play and good fun ifn not exactly seriously historical

RATING: 6
Nice and good paste theme with wonderful minis and easy to play rules. But the use of cards + dice adds too luck for me. Possible "block" situation when anyone picks the right cards. I figure it with two different decks of cards for blue and grays, with more statistical balance and  strategical options matching well with the different sides.

Have at least 3 copies of this game I know of, two jammed into one box.  Bought extra sets to make "epic" boards even before they started doing that with other games like M44 and C&C:A.  This is a super beer & pretzel game, perfect in simplicity but engaging in strategy and hand management.

Played multiple times.. very enjoyable after getting the rules cleared up. Multiple scenaros increases replay value.. roll of dice and draw of cards makes it abit luck based but nevertheless its fast paced actions makes game moving and interesting

Another favorite, but it can get frustrating. Especially a battle like chancesellerville in which force concentrations seem to be the opposite of the cards you get. Also Calvary only cards should allow you to move any unit if your cavalry is dead or non existent.

See review.

These were my first impressions from 2008:

When I saw that the victory conditions were merely to capture 6 units with a flag, I was quite skeptical, but it works as a goal in the way that draughts' capture more than your opponent works. I'll not call it an in-depth game but I enjoyed it.

I rate this game 3F for Fun, Fast and Furious. I feel this is a game that's just right for introducing young people to the hobby of wargames. The miniatures and artwork draws them in, the simplicity and shortness of the rules will keep their attention, and the fast & furious action will keep them engaged. They will also learn a little about the Civil War without it seeming like learning. This is a favorite game in my circle of friends. I have two copies and plan to start painting the miniatures of one copy this winter (2002/03).

For years, I considered trading this away.  But now that my kids are old enough to play I can't see myself getting rid of it.  It's great adult-kid or kid-kid fun - a perfect introductory wargame.

[i]Update:[/i]

...except, five years later, I still haven't played Battle Cry with my kids, or anyone else.

I think my (now teenage) kids would prefer A Few Acres of Snow, since deckbuilding is more their thing.  And with adults, I'd rather play something from the Napoleon 20 line.

So, this one needs to go.

An ancestor of Memoir '44, BattleLore, etc.  This one doesn't see much play since the others are better implementations of the same essential thing.  Differences are not insignificant however.  This one sports leaders that mix things up in interesting ways but is still relatively simple by comparison.

The box art and the bits sold this one for me.  The game itself was very different from anything I had played before.  My first exposure to the C&C system, I had mixed feelings on it.  The cards in this implementation of the system felt overly restrictive.  I really loved the theme and the historical battles though.  The presence of individual historical generals as pieces on the battlefield added even more personality.  I hope the upcoming heroes expansion for Battlelore will capture some of this feel.

I won't go much into the "is it a wargame?" discussion, only to say that it is about military engagments during the civil war. It's got nice production values and a fairly easy to learn system. The command cards do allow for chance to play a greater role than some would like, but to me they're what make this system (as opposed to standard miniature gaming) interesting.

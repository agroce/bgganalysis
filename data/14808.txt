RATING: 7
Good game, if a little complicated at first. The rulebook doesn't help much in this regard, but there are some useful resources in the files section of BGG to help clarify the rules. Once we got the hang of the rules though we enjoyed the gameplay. Need to play it more and really try out the supervillain aspect of the game.

RATING: 8
After playing a 2-player (solitaire) game, I can see the appeal of the game (especially to comic book fans like myself). It's fun to watch the superhero teams try to use their strengths to overcome villains and solve headlines. Managing resources (especially Plots points and Resource cards) is the core of the game. Then there's a lot of fun dice rolling but with many, many tactical modifiers (Hero's special abilities, Allies, Agents, Backup effects, etc.). The game does come off more as an "experience" (like a role-playing game) as opposed to real gamer's game like say Puerto Rico. I think there's room enough in the gaming world for both. The rules are not laid out well (they are fiddly as well) and maybe a better summary could have been done as the company's FAQ is a necessity. Others have remarked that each game seems to have a moment that is remembered (like a good game or comic) and mine had the Hulk failing to solve a last game round headline in Central Park and losing the game for the Avengers to the Fantastic Four. It was a classic comic tragedy.

And speaking as a DC comic lover, I'd love to see a "DC Heroes" game with a similar approach.

I was wary of the game given the number of negative comments, but I liked this one. For me, playing the theme carries the day. Our first game over stayed its welcome by maybe 30 minutes, but that's not too bad. However, it seems very likely this game has a very short life span - maybe 3-4 plays at most. I feel the hero teams are not necessarily balanced, but this doesn't take away from the systems involved. Everything worked for me - certainly the components are great, but also the game systems all had a neat purpose. Combat was thrilling at times, the villain contributions from others also felt right. Some parts are over cooked - like the skill to lower the threat was continually a tripping point. But all in all, a fun game.

Some nice figurines, some lovely cards, some clear but quite boring cards, and a fairly ugly board. I liked the basic action play in this, though perhaps it was a little simple. We found the Avengers pretty hard to stop winning, and the Nemesis rules were a little cumbersome . May have been better as a co-op.

One for the Marvel comics' fans.  The rest of us are likely to find this a disappointingly repetitive game; pick two characters, send on a mission, fight bad guys, rinse and repeat for how long?  Combat is simple, with the keys being to make best use of your characters' special abilities and be lucky with dice.  Aside from the characters, the theming just seems like window dressing.  There just isn't enough there to justify the two-hour game length.

As others have commented, the miniatures are very nice indeed, but the board is dull.

RATING: 5
despite the 7 average rating, i've read a lot about how this is just a matter of die rolling and modifiers.  i don't think that's exactly fair to the game.  for me, playing the villian role was interesting and had a number of decision points with a pleasant no-loss feeling.  i like how the players aren't directly combative, but play the enemy role when the other troubleshoots.  a lot of games have tried that and it's never really hit me.  not amazing, but decent execution.  production is great.  the rules are where it starts to go south.  they're digestable, especially if you skip the mastermind bits for your first game, but they're not so easily remembered and this isn't the kind of thing where i feel it's worthwhile to break out the bgg-posted flowchart just to get a game going.  mostly played with two, and i think it's best that way because of downtime.  my ultimate verdict is that it's decent, but i think the rule complexity to payola ratio is too out of whack.

RATING: 4
Not my favorite game ever, but once you get past the convoluted rules, a bit of fun walking around punching things. With three players it always felt like one was out of the loop and waiting; can only imagine that gets worse with four. Conceded near the end of turn three when we realized we couldn't catch up with the leader, who had 19 VP.

Would play again, just maybe not soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
For odd reasons, plays of this seemed plagued with incorrect rules.  The rules are not poor, but it is likely that you'll miss some on the initial plays.  This will definitely impact your impression of the game.  If you get past the rules questions, the game is rich with theme but strategy options might be limited.  There is plenty of dice roles in the game - which is okay - but will make the game lighter than serious gamers might prefer.  The game is almost there but misses on a few items and ultimately is not quite enough.  Penalties for ignoring headlines would be good as would making it rougher for the heroes.  Game may suffer from a degenerative play style of massing and knocking out the highest VP condition.  If players claim jump and take more risks, this will be much tougher.  Despite these set-backs, the game is still spot on for its theme and any fan of comics will find an enjoyable game.  [GTI: TGCL]

I really like the concept of managing your resources to deal with threats as I think it fits well with the superhero concept. I have only played it a few times but it seems to have a lot of variety and balance as well.

My complaints are twofold. 

First, as many have noted, it is really fiddly. There are just so many steps, modifiers, procedures, etc. It makes is very tough for a casual player to just step in and know how to implement strategy.

Secondly, while the rest of the components are top notch (love the character cards, resource cards, the figs, etc.), I think they could have done much better with the game board. Not only is it not very attractive, but I think the board should have been implemented more into the play of the game. Maybe get all the heroes on the board and forcing them to spread out to deal with threats?

I like the game, but think I am going to have a hard time getting it to the table with casual players.

A game of much lucky, because you have to launch dice for every action, there are too few interaction from players, also if i have te enemy of another player often he choose to not combat with me, so often every player make you own game.

Something just never clicked with me. I like the game as it's happening, but never want to bring it out. While at college, there was an overzealous SpiderMan girl, and some red drink was spilled on the board. As such, there are a few pockets of air along the board with a bit of discoloration. The box also has a bit of sticker residue from what could only be a price sticker.

Overly complex rules for a game that comes down to a bunch of pointless die rolls.

Being a fan of old school Marvel, I was really looking forward to this game.  The game reaches too much in too many directions with one-off rules zipping all over the game.  The meat of any superhero game is the combat system and Marvel Heroes is too light, instead they've deciding to focus on strategy rather than tactics.  However, I do like  how Boss monsters are handled.  Overall, I feel it's overpriced for a game that falls short on theme.

Woah!  Rules are lengthy to wade through for the first play.  Too much downtime between turns since there's so much going on and everything hinges on dice rolls.  Too difficult for your team to accomplish much because plot points are scarce, super-vehicles are tough to "buy", and the headlines are often tough to win once everyone builds a fistful of villain cards.  Too easy for the master-villians to get advanced to the level where they take 5 points from the hero team.  Perhaps the game is better for 2 players.  I would give the game another chance, but two of our four players said "never again".

Cool game, especially as a comic fan, this game could be very fascinating.
A lot of rules how to move, attack, plan, and so on and it takes a lot of courage to choose which best superhero for your every movement, this could probably be done because you have superheros and villains to be combined.

I feel that Marvel Heroes is a good game, it just has the wrong theme attached to it, as well as some unattractive wording, unintuitive design, and a difficult rulebook (this coming from someone who usually has no problem with FFG rulebooks).  Perhaps if the theme were something more based in investigation (or, hey, how about something more along the lines of Ghostbusters?) instead of something that is supposed to be action packed like superheroes, the good game that Marvel Heroes is deep down inside would have been easier to see.

RATING: 7
Quite repetitive, over long and rather dull - I was looking forward to playing this, but didn't enjoy it much at all. 

Update - played again and the experience was much better ... so I've cleared my rating and I'll redo once I've played a bit more.

I think the learning curve on this is quite steep, and you need to know what you are doing to manage the random factors in the game - it's easy to make poor decisions (in ignorance) and end up with most of your team KO'd which means a turn of doing nothing - hard to come back from that.

*** Update, game experience really depends on the scenario you play. I tried it twice with the recommended beginner scenario (first to 15 vps) and it isn't very good for beginners! The expert usually thrashes the newbies and the newbies don't really learn the game or know how it happened :(

Now I've played using the fixed turn length scenarios and it is much much better. Updated my rating to a 7, and it could go higher. Not sure I'd want to play with 4 though (3 seems best).

A bit of a mixed bag.  Very thematic and manages to tell a story.  Combat is abstracted but fun with tense dice rolls and the power names give you a feel for what is going on.  There is a lot of complexity in the rules, when does dice boosting apply, various procedures- combat, troubleshooting, beginning of round, etc, which ideally would be streamlined just a bit, with additional complexity coming from the cards.  What you're actually doing in the game, once you get used to it, doesn't feel that complicated, so the difficulty of learning the game and teaching the game hurts it a bit for me.  The board is a bit misleading in that it is a map of a small area but you don't move around it (you warp around).  Maybe it would have made more sense as a map of the world or North America deploying your heroes to different areas.  The story track is also a weird element that serves to essentially let you pass and get some cards but doesn't feel like it fits well in the game to me.  I also get this nagging feeling that this is a 2nd. edition away from greatness but it's extremely unlikely to get an overhaul AFAIK.

It's not so easy to start playing this game. The rulebook is very poorly written (italian edition) so I spent just three evening game sessions with my friends trying to understand how to play it.

This game borrows heavily from Middle Earth CCG's core mechanic of playing both your own heroes and your opponent's villains at the same time.  It does this fairly well given its smaller card set.

Aesthetically, this game is quite acceptable: painted, detailed minis, nice board, good quality cards, etc.

Other than that, it is something of a train-wreck. The rules are both disorganized and unclear, the majority of your actions are tedious and uninteresting, and the game drags on seemingly interminably. Finally, and this is the biggest problem (given the theme), it simply is not *fun* to play (IMHO)... It feels more like you are a taxi-company dispatcher than a superhero team.

I don't think I've ever been so disappointed by a game in my life.  This is a clunky abstraction of a superhero game with no interesting decisions or unique abilities.  The battle system is awful, the story action doesn't make any sense at all (hooray for random VPs), the minis really aren't that great, and the ugly board and a number of chits are entirely superfluous.  This got made because of the Marvel license, plain and simple.  I can not believe how creaky and boring this game is, and how it doesn't feel anything remotely like I'm doing something great or interesting on any turn.  On top of all of this, they're charging $59.95 MSRP for a box that's more air than components.  Don't support companies that do this, FFG, I'm looking at you here.

It's an extra 5 minutes every time you have to fight one for extremely little game effect.  I'm also not at all into the comic theme, as I'm not familiar with any of the characters.  Overall, it was just too long for what it offers, like most other giganto-box FFG games that I've played.  You'd be hard pressed to get me to play again.

RATING: 6.5
A better game than I expected. Fun towards the end as players strive against each other to get points. The mechanics of this game are also suitable for Arkham Horror, and if they are implemented, would make Arkham Horror a much better game.

Immensely clever series of ideas without anyone able to edit them down into a workable game for the target audience, folks who love comics. The result is loads of bits and bobs that get in the way of playing the game early on, a series of samey combats full of little decisions and many modifiers. This permits a most impressive series of villains and heroes but equally makes the game longer and with more downtime than I'd like.

Out of the three who played it today, two will never do so again in its present form.

This has oodles of theme and works really well with enough random possibilities from the dice to see some cool bizarre type superhero things happening in most games. Juggernaut is a right stomping machine and the sentinels are just as evil as they should be. Great Game. 11 Plays.

This game is a lot of fun. It really scratches the comic book itch. Serious strategy games probably won't like it because it is a bit of a theme-dependent game. However, I really enjoy it and I think they did a wonderful job of capturing the feel of the Marvel world. Can't wait for the expansions.

RATING: 6
Fun bits and interesting mechanic with managing the trouble meter and how much the other players can mess with you.  This game needs to be played out, which makes it a very long game, but it's entertaining enough.  The board looks amateurish and the story track seems tacked on and too random.  The masterplans are neat - but might be too fiddly with the scheming and extra steps.

The game has some heroes (Human Torch, Thor, Cyclops for example) that just didn't see any use as it was more cost-effective to use the other three of the team to fight crime, draw resource cards and gain plot points.  Nice to have them for theme, but there is little incentive to use them that can't be better resolved with the weaker members of the team.

Very nice game.
The rules are not too well-written (at least in the German version) and a bit confusing, but if you take the time to sit down and study them (and grab the game reference sheets from BGG and / or Headless Hollow), then this will turn out to be a pretty cool and fun game.

RATING: 7
What should have been the victory lap for the War of the Ring team seems to have turned out to be closer to their sophomore slump- Marvel Heroes is a disappointingly pedestrian game that seems to fall into the same design idiom that characterizes every comic book hero game from JUDGE DREDD through the Richard Borg X-Men games to HEROES INC.- die rolls and super powers that modify die rolls, a map where crimes happen and heroes set forth to "solve" them, and "thematic" use of the Comic Sans Serif font.  MARVEL HEROES is definitely not a bad game at all- if you're into the House That Jack Kirby Built (yeah, I said it) it's plenty of fun just to trot out the great characters and toss dice at classic villains like Dr. Doom and Magneto but the end result just feels really uninspired.  I think the choices in the game are very, very limited despite relatively complex rules (sorry, but "choose to roll 3 dice or 4 dice" is a pretty sorry decision point) and although there is some planning- more like coordination really- the end result is another game that tries to obfuscate die roll modifiers and three universal statistics with fancy super power names.  There are some fairly interesting mechanics here, particularly in the way that the teams interact with their archenemies and it ultimately is a fairly well-balanced and functional system but there's very little in terms of narrative or a sense of development- sure, each team and nemesis can "upgrade" three times but in a 2 hour game it feels a little slim.  All in all, the game is a missed opportunity- when you look at the outstanding production values in the game and then realize that Galactus isn't even represented with a picture you can't help but feel that something much bigger (and more accessible to non-gamers) could have come out of this tremendous license, these gifted designers/developers, and Fantasy Flight Games.  It definitely plays better with 3 or 4 than with 2, and if you're really into Marvel go ahead and bump it up a point (like I did on the rating)- seeing Elektra accidentally stumble into a Sentinel and a bunch of Hydra agents robbign a jewelry store has _got_ to make you smile.

RATING: 6
Decent dice/card management game with a fantastic comic book theme.  It's a bit heavy on the modifiers to die rolls (like Descent), and it takes a full play to grasp all of the rules, but an alright game anyway.  Yet to try with three or four players.

One play.  The marriage of game and theme here seems strong.  The biggest downside is this is going to be a difficult game to teach as there are always many options to keep in mind.  Our teaching time/first round went over two hours.  None-the-less I found myself highly engaged ... but I'm not sure it would be the same for someone who hasn't read a lot of comic books.  Looking forward to more plays.

Without the theme, I don't think Marvel Heroes would be as well-regarded. The game relies mostly on luck, and there are very few meaningful decisions to be made. For a superhero game, the pace is also far too slow.

This is a good "medium-advanced" board game.  There are a number of rules to keep track of, but start making sense with multiple plays.  The ability to play as the "team" of superheros is a great dynamic to the game and facing off against your arch-nemesis is a cool game feature.  My biggest problem is the initiation of new players into this game.  It becomes too bulky and large for a quick game.

Competitiu de 2-4J.
Cada jugador controla un grup de 4 superherois i el Villano del jugador de la seva esquerra.

Salvant les distàncies, el dia següent de jugar-hi (quan vaig assimilar-lo) em va recordar bastant al Caos:
- Hi ha un nombre limitat de rondes (7 al Caos, 5 al MH). Hi ha 1 event que modifica la partida (al Caos en cada ronda es treu un nou event).
- En cada ronda hi ha una etapa de Planificació (Invocació al Caos) en el que portes figuretes al taulell o fas determinades accions (fins a 5). I en fa una cadascú, és a dir, cada jugador fa la 1a, després cada jugador fa la 2a, etc. etc. fins la 5a (similar al Caos).
- Hi ha super-herois de més nivell que costen més de portar al taulell (= invocar) que altres.
- Hi ha 3 cartes de millora pels super-herois (també n'hi ha 3 al Caos).
- Hi ha tot un seguit de cartes que es poden jugar al llarg de la partida per aconseguir certs beneficis o putejar als altres (com les cartes del Caos).
- Els combats res resolen amb daus, però aquí se'n tiren molts més i són més complexes.

 I'd like to play this again soon as we were still sorting out the rules in the 2nd game so it took longer than it probably should have. I think its a game that will reward a little bit of persistance to learn for a few games, I'm just not sure most are willing to give it that chance.

Fun, flavorful, but a touch fiddly.  Not in the same league as War of the Ring IMO, but still very good.  Don't expect to play very well the first time you play.  I agree the rulebook could be laid out better to use an index.  And the friggin' micro-font from War of the Ring is back on some of the decks of cards (thankfully not the ones you use very often).

RATING: 5
Surprisingly convoluted superhero game suffers from one of the worst rulebooks in board game history.  Perhaps a bit too deep for it's own good when you're just looking for a good clobberin'. The foes you encounter during missions are shamefully random and actually a bit of an insult to the comics they're based on.

Great game, but don't bother playing with folks who aren't Marvel fans. I like the engine. There were a couple of things that could have been made clearer, but really common sense can decide questions. I'd have liked to see a little variation in the story card effects. Make some able to do things that others can't. A mechanice that some headlines have a challange that would have to be beaten before they were solved would be a nice twist too. (Some stuff should be hard to do whether or not bad guys show up!)

Some parts of this game just seem like a waste.  Like 1 KO villains and story cards.  The ally powers are all over the map in terms of usefulness, but all cost the same.  The theme carries the mountains of dice rolling pretty well, so it is worth playing occasionally.  But MAN is that rulebook just utter crap.  And the little cheat sheets only cover half the game, so nice job there too.

RATING: 7
Fun game of superheroes.  Each hero has certain powers and can accumulate more.  Mostly these affect the die roll modifiers either directly or through a card that is acquired.  Good fun playing this one.  However, there are a good bit of rules to keep straight.  Also, I'd like to see more a tactical exercise.  Such a big board but it serves little function.

RATING: 6
Players take on a team of super heroes, plus the arch enemy of another super hero team, and try to satisfy the victory conditions of the scenario.  Players plan what their team will do during the upcoming "mission" phase of the turn.  Planning involves determining who will fight, who will support and who will stay and rest.  Missions mainly involve leaping on the map (of New York City) and fighting the hot spots of trouble that are springing up.  Settling things down grants the team victory points, which is the main way of winning.  There is a lot more going on here than these brief sentences, but it all feels just right.  Heroes, villains, great art, and a very good game.  Rules are a bit of a struggle, but the game itself plays very well.  Worth a look.

There's a lot more strategy here than you might think, and there's enough dice rolling that things usually work out the way you'd expect, but with the occasional upset to keep you on your toes.  However, I worry a bit about the balance between the teams, and it seems that a lucky card draw can really slant things in one player's favor.  Also, the game is just a little too complex for it to be a gateway game, which is a little counterintuitive given the theme.  

I think that Nexus may have learned the wrong lesson from the success of The War of the Ring.  That game is so deep, and so reminiscent of its source material that people are willing to put up with the fiddliness of it.  But when it comes to Superheroes, It's Clobberin' Time!  I thin it was amistake to weigh the game down with all the niggling rules like they got away with in WotR.

I think I'd be happy to play this once in a while, but owning it, and therefore having the responsibility of teaching it, was ultimately too much of a burden for me, so I traded it.

Great Ameritrash game.  It kind of feels like it might be a euroganme at first, but this is an Ameritash game. Strap in your seats for some comic hero fighting action.

An under-rated game, probably because of a convoluted rulebook.  The rules make the game seem a lot harder than it really is.  This is a classic example of a game that is best to have somebody teach you in person.  Visually, it's a home run.  The game rewards thoughtful planning.  It's a lot of fun sending out heroes and battling against a ton of different enemies.  While it never fully achieves a narrative thread, the combat system here is very innovative and exciting, which makes the core of the game very good.  Admittedly, I enjoy this far more than the average gamer.

I thought that the game rules was a bit confusing when I first read them I found that they were not well written. Sentenses are to long and there is too many details which could of been left out.

Better too keep it short and simple.

Update:

Played my first game. I enjoy it although there was a lot of reading to do with the special abilities of each hero and the different cards.

After playing a second or third time, it was easier looking back at my first game played ans say I should of use that special ability at that particular moment. It is easy to forget when your troubling and fighting an oppenent.

Mechanic of the game is very well thought of concerning the theme of the game in question. I think it is one of the best super hero board game out there today.

Update II :

I recently played two more games. We fined tune  the rules. Think we are playing it right. The game is hot at the moment. One of my best friends is a huge avengers fan. I often play Marvel Heroes with him.

We have been playing with 4" lead hand painted figurines that I am collecting and it adds to the overall pleasure playing this game compared to the figurines which comes with the game.

I read and collect comics so knowing the back ground of each hero and villian adds to pleasure playing Marvel Heroes.

Must have for any comic book fan.

Played once.  This is a good game, more so if you're a marvel fan.  There's lots of micro decisions to make, and the fights can generate some memorable "stories" and tension.  There's a huge learning curve, though.  I don't like the washed-out look of the board.  The different game scenarios add variety to the game.  I'd happily play this again, although I wouldn't do another rules explanation up front for newbies -- I'd make them play the game and learn as we go; there's just too much to explain.  Suck up your first game as a learning one.

This game has theme, in the sense that it fleshes out the heroes and villains and their special powers. But the execution of the theme is pretty bland. Going around "troubleshooting" generic cards and fight bad guys in an uninteresting dice-fest. If it was less overwrought, it might have been better but sitting through the rules explanation can put you to sleep, and God forbid if you have to read the rulebook yourself to figure the game out.

Some of my best gaming memories are of playing this game, combat system is amazing. Love those dice. Yeah there's a lot going on but I enjoyed all the learning games (first 6 or 7 till I finally nailed it, sadly). Fortunately I can teach new people the game better than the rulebook so they don't have as harder time as I did. Great that other players are involved in each others combat so down time is hardly any. If you are their nemesis (you have heroes and 1 villian of another player) then you are very actively involved. Minis are spot on, fighting strategy is cool and allows for push your luck to try to claw back. I like the euro elements fused with ameri and heavy card play on top. Variable end goals too - love it!

Being a Marvelite, I really enjoyed this game. Being a gamer, I struggled to absorb all the rules and special actions. Once we got the hang of the plot points and combat, we were able to concentrate on the detail, and the result was a very enjoyable 3 hour game. But I don't think this would suit family gamers much. It wasn't helped by the very tiny font on some of the cards, and some of the values seemed a little low or weak, but that was marginal. I do think some tweaking could turn this into a much faster experience, but we definitely want a copy now and want to play this again. I looked at all the new characters and suggestions, and the game seems ripe for development.

Initial impressions based on one play - Not a bad little game, but quite dry. Doesn't really feel like a super heroes game. Actually got my wife to play because it wasn't all just combat. Took us a while to get into it however, due to the need for constant rules reference. Knocked out the first play in about 90 minutes. (To 15 points) 

The figures are nicely done, and do the job admirably. The art on the cards is typical comic book fare. The map board didn't match the quality of the rest of the presentation, but I really don't care. The board is quite functional, and does what it's supposed to do. 

If you come to this game expecting a slugfest, you'll be disappointed. Combat is abstracted. This is really more of a superhero themed resource allocation and hand management game. It you come to the game with that in mind, you should do just fine. 

Eliminated in the great game purge of 05/30/2010.

During my second game, I had to fight every urge to grab the game and hurl it across the room -- that's how screwed I was getting because of my dice rolling. I was also swearing like a Portuguese sailor. After the game was over I wanted to play again.  That's the sign of a pretty good game.  Game works very well with two players and there is virtually no downtime because you are either controlling your heroes or a villlian.

How disappointing! :( I like the thematic but the game is really bad.
Pro: really well done figures and the whole game brings in all Marvel characters, villains, stories...
Con: too much to read, the board is actually useless (could have been a card/dice game), far too complicated for the less strategy really needed in it cause at the end it's all a luck game.

It was only a little over an hour for 2 players.  Neither nemesis got very far with their master plans.  Fun game, but complicated rules and seems like it would be a lot longer with more players.

Rating is after first play...there's a lot to like here, no doubt about it.  After playing it, I'm glad they didn't go the tactical skirmish route but did something that tried to capture the storytelling essence more.  It's clever, and I like it.

Not for the weak-of-heart.  This is a tactical-level game, so if you understand the concept of and appreciate operational-level games exclusively, you might want to steer clear.

A fun game, but some of the rules could be more clear.  Still, once you get the hang of it it's fun.  The game has a good mix of strategy and theme, and it's a shame Nexus lost the license because it's probably the best board game featuring the property that was ever made.

RATING: 6.5
The rules for this game can be a real pain to get through and are not clear on quite a few things. There are many little things that will be missed the first few games and it will take a while to get the hang of the game. It feels as though they made the game more complicated than it should be and game play can go on for quite some time.

Still it's a fun game once you figure out the flow of everything. The minis are cool of course and add to the flavor of the game, but the rest of the components are nothing to get excited about. The print on most of the cards is very small and can be hard to see for read for people with less then normal vision and the gameboard on the copy I played on was very cheaply produced, being warped and peeling, due to not being cut properly. We actually had to trim the board to get it to lay a little flatter.

All in all it was an ok game that was fun. Not something that I would want to play all the time and would surely rather play Capes N Cowls over this game for my super hero fix.

Many thanks to my friend John for introducing me to this game.

I'm not the target audience here, not being a marvel comics fan, but once over the hurdle of digesting the rules ended up quite enjoying the 'storyboard' aspect of the game.

An amazing game, and one I'd recommend even if you only have a passing interest in Marvel's heroes. It's good for two or three, but it really shines with four players.

Despite all the complaints about it being fiddly, and boring, I tend to disagree. Fiddly? Yes, oh yes. Boring? far from it.

It's a fun, engaging, super-hero game that is dripping in theme, which is very well integrated into the gameplay itself. As long as you look at this game as playing through as a group of heroes and a villain in a comic book (and don't mind yelling out heroic, or villainous phrases once in a while), you'll have a blast.

I've played this at least 50 times now, and it's different every time, and all the teams are VERY balanced despite what many say about the Fantastic Four. If you're humming and hawing over this one, but you like comics, then go for it. You won't be let down.

I used to demo this one on a regular basis, and find that despite the complexity, and if introduced to the various elements ina step-ladder fashion, it is quite easy to grasp, even for non-gamers. The Lady, for example, really likes it, and she is by no means a 'gamer'. It's fun, but unless you have the secret decoder ring (as I do) you might have difficulty deciphering the rulebook. But, since this game's strategy develops in layers (upon layers), a lot of those used to simple mechanics are going to be overwhelmed.

This is the reason I demo the game for those who want to try it, but are having trouble figuring out the rules. But then again, I find Caylus and Powergrid (both highly rated games) to be yawn-fests, and boring brain-burners. Games are about fun, and not paralyzing yourself in trying to beat all the odds. Again, it's a complex, deep game, but if you sit there trying to mathematically figure out your chances of beating the odds, instead of throwing your heros (and villains) into the fight, like a comic book SHOULD be, then you'll be paralyzed, and likey bored. This one's about taking chances, as comic heroes always do, and they don't always win.

Marvel fans come hither, this one's for you.

Now that this treasure is OOP, get your hands on a copy if you're still undecided. I can see this game being worth some money in the future, but that could just be the fanboy talking.

11 years later, and it's still holding strong as a 10 for me, despite the deciphering needed for the rulebook. Lots of fun if you can find it, although it suffers from many of the problems with older FFG titles.

Initial impressions: Based on one play, I'd say that this game was deserving of maybe a 6 or a 7.  But, I get the feeling that it has low replay value.  Your characters don't develop over time, and the strengths of the enemies you fight is almost entirely random.  It's kind of like Runebound, if you started at level 3, never got XP, never got equipment, and didn't know which color encounters you were trying.  Second play: initial impressions stand.

Highly disappointing point hoarding game. The Marvel Heroes are just there for show, it could have been a bunch of ducks fighting over a pond and it would have made no difference.

The idea of another playing the nemesis of the another is nice, saves some time and is a simplistic mechanic.

But overall, I really don't feel like I am playing superheroes, feels just like a dice-rolling game where you take few decisions and it's luck that decides what happens.

Don't buy this.

I keep this game due to nostalgia for my comic collecting days.  The components are top notch, the graphic design feels like Marvel Comics from my era of collecting, and the play-your-opponent's- villain is fun mechanic.  However, the actual game play is much less enjoyable than I'd wished.

Huge luck fest. Excessive, unintuitive and extremely fiddly rules, with holes and inconsistencies. It seems a lot of effort was put into researching the theme (or maybe the designers are avid fans), but its implementation failed miserably. Hero superpowers are just a set of combat stats. The superfluous story track doesn't feel like a story at all. And totally different kinds of troubles are resolved in the very same way. The painted miniatures are very nice, but the board is horrible. I admit I had some laughs when the dice acted unexpectedly, but it was not really fun when I felt that one roll decided the game, after about four hours. Overall, the game is as bad as "War of the Ring", by the same designers.

Very cool game.  It took a bit to get through the rules and to understand what the game was trying to do, but once we did we found a very neat game with plenty of choices to make.  Just be patient when learning it as there are a lot of things happening at once.  And the best way to teach new players is to just set it up and go.

Pulled this out again after a long time on the shelf and rediscovered this great game. It's really a resource management game,and you feel like the leader of you group of heros,pulling the strings to get the right hero in the right place at the right time. Ally cards are really useful,and the various scenarios you can play keep it fresh.

I like this game.  But some cautions to those planning to take the MH plunge: 

1) It's more an abstract game and NOT at all a tabletop mini game.  The minis are cool but are purely non-essential "chrome;" the game barely even needs a map (it's area control so could be anything, not solely Manhattan).

2) There's a lot in common with CCG's in that every hero has special powers which bend or break or modify the standard rules of engagement.  Add to that the resource cards which contain additional modifiers; the three power-ups that each hero team can acquire, and there's a lot of card combo thought-processing for each action, and especially in combat.  And pursuant to these two points...   

3) It's not you -- the rulebook for this game IS non-intuitive and poorly written.  Very important rules and/or clarifications are threaded into blocks of text.  It took our group (a healthy mix of casual gamers and seasoned vets) 2.5 times to *finally* get all the rules right.  

PS, Fantasy Flight: would it kill you to ever print an INDEX to accompany your rulebooks?      

Budget time to ingest the rules.  Take advantage of the helpful player guides and FAQ's at BGG.  And understand that unless and until you and your group have played this a few times, that the "fiddly" parts of the game will remain so.  Once people start remembering their powers, and to quickly do the "modifier math" for combats or big tilts in the game, MH is a lot more streamlined.    

I'd definitely reserve judgement on the game until you've at least played twice; I like it now, but I think the first game would drive a casual gamer (even one that's mad about Marvel) screaming in the other direction from the hobby.

Much better than everyone says, but it is too long for what it is.  Too many rules for this type of game.  All the BS character activation, plot points, all that crap is pointless and not really very much fun.  The fighting, special abilities, sending different characters to different sites, battling supervillains, thats the fun part.  Why is the other crap in the game?  I still like it a lot and would play it again.  You have to wade through a little bookeeping BS to get to the FUN but the FUN is big when it hits. 

As a game that attempts to emulate the story arc of comic books, it really shines, but I don't think that part of the game is very much fun.  Its too bad they couldn't have made it more important and streamlined the non-combat mechanics a bit, because I think a very fun game is hiding in here somewhere!

A bit of a learning curve, mainly because I was teaching the game. Once I learn all the nauances of the game, the rating may go up. I really love this game. I was excepting a combat game and was pleasantly surprised by an in-depth strategy involving planning and solving encounters with combat sprinkled here and there when needed. I particularly enjoy playing both heroes and villains. 

Update: For the most part, playing the game is actually like reading a comic book. 

Update: We had a bad board warping issue. We cut the boards apart and used packing tape around the edges. It's still a great game but had we not fixed the board, it would have been unplayable.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one 3 player session.  I am a long time Marvel comics fan, so I have been waiting for this one since I first heard about it and it doesn't disappoint.  The game is a lot of fun.  Detailed, yet reasonably light.  Plays a lot quicker than I expected it to (which is good).  We got through the game using the "Born Again" scenario in about 90 minutes, and that was with a player who had played once before (Mike Barnes.  It was HIS Sentinel and MY Elektra mentioned in his comments below), a second player who had skimmed the rules (me), and a third brand new player.  It captures a lot of the feel of comics as long as you have players who are into that kind of thing and can metagame and roleplay (sort of).  A lot of fun was had with the ridiculous hero/villain pairings.  For example; on the first turn, I was running the Marvel Knights and had Daredevil investigating a protection racket or something.  Suddenly, through a bad (for me) die roll, the Trouble level got jacked up and suddenly Daredevil is going toe-to-toe with a Sentinel! (I had a lot of Sentinel problems)  Daredevil prevailed by using his billy club (!) to beat the Sentinel into scrap metal.  The Story cards, while at first seeming like a silly and artificial mechanic, wound up being the key to victory as the X-Men and Avengers were neck and neck for the win, but, on the last action phase, the X-Men were able to snatch one last victory point off the board via the Story cards for the win.  We were a bit confused by the different abilities as it doesn't seem like there is much of a reason to go with anything other than the "obvious" choice, however, there are certain cards and effects that will make you want (or have) to use a possibly weaker ability.  For example; Elektra has Ninjitsu as one of her abilities, but it is weaker than her Sai Stab ability... however, if she uses Ninjitsu and gets a KO result on an enemy, she can add a second KO to her result.  Of course, this is assuming that she can out roll her enemy by using her weaker ability.  There is some definite strategy and planning involved in this one, more so than I expected... and it cost me in the end.  The different Major Headline cards add some nice twists to the core gameplay,  ala the Great Old Ones' effects in Arkham Horror, in order to keep it fresh.  It is not the most heavy game, but, that is alright.  I didn't really need another World of Warcraft with 50 million chits and tokens (not that there is anything wrong with that).  I am very pleased with this one overall and am looking forward to playing it again soon.  I can see a LOT of room for expansions on this one, and that is perfectly fine by me... as long as they don't add Power Pack as one of the playable teams...

This is a great game, as you basically play one super hero team and one villain, but as you play all the players may boost and playing your enemy, its a very competative game, its a great game for that, my only problem with the game is that its very difficult for new people to learn, and remembering all the actions is not an easy thing, making a cheat sheet helps a lot. Nonetheless the complex rules are a double-edge sword, it gives great depth but can a lot confuse.

There's some definite strategy to the game.  I felt that the theming was slightly off, and you often end up with the Avengers or X-Men fighting the Green Goblin instead of Spider-Man fighting him.  Lots of information and not all of it is clearly organized.  Some interesting mechanics.  No indexing of rules.  Poor reference aids for the most complex portions of the game (Mastermind Villain rules).  Played with a friend's copy -- after two plays the board was completely warped and the front and the back papers were delaminating from the underlying chipboard.

Amazing theme. I like playing, but it is really to chaotic and random for me. Also not enough interaction. Great conceptual mechanics.

update: The more I play it the more I hate it, not the game for me. Rating has gone from 7 to 4.5. Ultimate the game falls flat on 3 fronts
1. The rock, scissors, paper thing is cool, but takes a long time and adds significant down time. Normally this isn't an issue for me, but it generally adds to the dull feeling of the game.
2. A single dice roll can make or break the game. Allowing the person to your left to win.
3. There is a sizeable turn order advantage. This while isn't the only decider often makes it almost impossible for the person who goes last to win.

We played this twice in two days and I really liked it. Completely different from the regular German style Euro games I usually like. The rules took a while to get your head round because of mechanics impacting on others but once you were there it all worked effortlessly and elegantly. I would reccomend it and by far the best theme game ive played.

RATING: 1
I have seen this game described here at bgg as being "all about combat". That's too bad because the combat in this game is tedious, uninspiring, and not comic book accurate in the slightest. 

I am an experienced gamer and only play with experienced gamers. None of us wanted any more to do with that rule book and its circuitous, opaque descriptions. The player aids here at bgg, historically impeccable and hugely valuable, couldn't even crack the absurdity of this dog.

If you want a super hero game about combat it's a no-brainer - get Heroclix.

RATING: 3
Not an unpleasant playing game really but at 4 hrs using the default scenario card and with 4 players, there are equivalent (or better) playing experiences with less dice and similar tension.  Too long, even if repeated playings brought the time down to around 3hrs.  Nice to see some familiar Euro mechanics filtering into yet another theme-heavy ameri-trash offering.

Beautiful components, nice feel and theme, but the game lacks something in pacing and excitement... or, to put in plain terms, fun. Somehow the mechanics feel a bit *clunky*. Still, once you wade through the terrible rulebook, and wisely decide reading the bgg summary instead, a few games in might find you enjoying at least some, if not all, aspects of the game.

I want to like this game.  I really do.  There are just a few things missing from it.  The game is ending just as it feels like it is getting going.

Most games are good as they are and the expansions are nowhere near as good as the original.  This one feels like it needs an expansion to add more to it however.

The theme improves my rating by one, and possible two points.  Its fiddly, its too abstract for its theme, and its mechanisms are devoid of innovation.  That said, I had real flashes of fun.  If you are not a comic book fan, don't even touch it.  But if you can see the humor in the Human Torch outwiting Doctor Doom, its work a go.

RATING: 7.5
As a huge Marvel fan and a big fan of the War of the Ring, I was more than a little excited to finally get ahold of this game!  

The figure are beautiful as are the cards, the board leaves a bit to be desired, though it is functional. The game does seem a bit bogged down by flakey rules yet at the same time I wish there was more details about the characters.  Basicall, their powers boil down to different sets of attack/defense/wit, which is disapponting. They do have special powers for being the ready/supporting hero but they feel generic. Basically it comes down to having the number of heroes ready/suporting, getting the right allies, and having the right baddies at the right time. It was also shorter than I expected (2-player game using the suggested first time scenario). 

All-in-all I'm a bit disappointed since I was expecting a game as thematic and deep as War of the Ring but I"m still looking forward to trying it a few more times, hopefully I'm wrong.

This game has been so long in the making it's not even funny anymore. I can't believe that I actually got it after waiting so long for it. It was not disappointing, gameplay-wise, but the minis make me sad... They look so, so easy to break...  :cry:

***UPDATE***
Well, I've played some games now and I can say that Marvel Heroes is a mixed package. The theme is wonderfully integrated and I think that the gameplay is fun, but some people (mainly non-Marvel fans) really hate it. And I can say I understand why. The decisions, while interesting, are not meaningful and the luck factor is overwhelming.

***UPDATE***
After a ton of games (seriously,playing this with my brother is a blast), I am surprisingly happy to report that no miniature is broken! :D

To be perfectly honest I don’t remember much about the game. I played it years ago. I remember I never liked it very much, I expected a better game but the components were great!

OK, I want to really like this game but, like my Nephew says, it's a very BUSY game. Lot's of rules, rules that supercede those rules and rules you can't find except in the weirdest places (is 9 the most trouble? No! The counter flips over for 10  but it you can't find it in the rules). Despite all that and the fact I'm spent after playing it, I like the game. After all, it's frikking SUPER HEROES!!!! Update: I made a 1 page flow chart with critical rules explained which makes the game super easy to play. *** Added in new MODS from online and my variants to make the fights tougher.

5.9.2007: I can't think of anything that I disliked about the game, so I'm quite sure my rating will rise. It's not perfect, but it has potential.

Great mechanics and design, interesting to look at, lots of cool little bits...  but in the end, it's all dice and (barring horrendous decision-making) luck.  My first full game of this I won a total of one fight and spent the rest of the game fumbling around not doing anything due to ridiculously bad dice rolling.  After another player defeated a pretty strong villain that I was controlling AND his nemesis with a single character without suffering even a single KO due to bad dice rolling on my part, i decided I'd had enough.  I don't mind luck in my games, but I do mind it when luck keeps me from either playing the game at all or having fun.

Decent enough heroes game. The battles are a little abstract but he mechanics of the game are cool. I love the fact that you are always engaged even when it's not your turn. Absolutely no downtime.

Lot of rules and dicefestish. Seems overly complicated for the lack of options available. My biggest gripe is the [b]absurd inbalance[/b] of the Fantastic 4 and Dr. Doom. Why did they make them so broken? Doesn't make sense.

Game isn't super epic with game tokens and rush to victory. The end is [b]quite anti-climatic[/b] with some players sweeping ahead with ambiguous story actions.

I'll post up Psylocke soon, but she does need tweaking. Seems too powerful of a support character right now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An extremely abstracted strategy game based on the Marvel universe. Too many rules and the fiddliness of the rules made it hard to enjoy the game. Even doing the voices of the characters didn't help. 

I think the potential buyer needs to keep 2 things in mind. Firstly, this is a strategy game. Players need to view their Heroes as resources and you need to find the most efficient way to use them. There wasn't much room for roleplaying or character development. Secondly, the designers had to capture a multitude of powers with a very abstract system. So, while the powers might have cool names, their effects pretty much all feel the same.

As a result, it was very hard to "feel" the theme in the game. If this was a strategy game without the Marvel theme, I would probably have enjoyed it more. As a sometime-reader of the comic books, I was very disappointed with the implementation of the game.

Lives up to my expectations with a few minor dissapointments. I find that many times the player interaction is void when it comes to hero vs. hero and wonder if the game would have been better with limited number of missions to choose from. I also would have liked the main theme cards to interact more with the board -- kind of like the greater ones in the Arkham game -- imagine, for example, if the brood is the main story line that once a round an alien brood shows up on a random space on the city and can be attacked by heroes for 1 point and if a certain number of brood are on the board the game ends with player loss. Something. I just want to feel the main story line is actually relevant while I'm having fun with all the other eye candy.

This game is bloody awful. The only reason I managed to convince my friends to play it more than once was because of the Marvel tie-in. The game systems themselves are too abstract and dumb. The round-to-round gameplay feels like a lot of busywork, and the endgame is always anticlimactic.

There is a lot of randomness involved in this game, and there aren't enough thematic elements to make up for it.  The board was a lot more drab than I had expected, and the various headlines ("missions") are really just a collection of numbers and properties.  I expected more customized flavor; battling zombies is effectively the same as investigating a smuggling ring.  The game is just very fiddly with lots of minor rules and special cases that make the first couple of games very slow to get started, and rules can get confused even after repeated plays.  Add random events, card draws, handfuls of customized dice, AP-inducing special effects (that really just add extra dice or reroll dice), and group leader-bashing to the uninspiring gameplay, and you have a loser with some second-rate plastic miniatures.  At least the miniatures are painted.

There are definitely much better superhero games out there.  Even those that feature a good amount of randomness at least try to provide some thematic gameplay as well.

P.S.  How does Wolverine's regeneration translate into an attack?

RATING: N/A
Marvel Heroes is a game set in the Marvel Universe for 2 to 4 players, with plenty of opportunities for cooperation and competition between the Super Heroes controlled by the players. Players take control of a group of Super Heroes (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Marvel Knights or the Avengers) as well as the Nemesis of one of the other player's group (Magneto, Dr. Doom, Kingpin or Red Skull). During the game, each player finds allies, enemies and power-ups, and face the menacing Super Villains controlled by the other players.

Definitely a very fiddly game in which its easy to miss a rule here or there.  Only one play under my belt, I know we played incorrectly regarding a couple rules and I still have a couple questions.  Its probably one of those games I'd rather be taught than teach.  I'd recommend checking out some of the uploaded player aids and such before playing the first time.  A fair bit of luck involved with the dice rules but this game is primarily about managing your risk through ally cards and your superheroes and their abilities.  An interesting game, I'm not certain which way I will end up leaning concerning this game although I do want to play again.

RATING: 7.5
I am a fan of the older Marvel comic characters from my youth so this one is a nice fit for me in terms of the theme.  It seems a bit fiddly in some respects.  The game is all about the effective management of your planning phases and your mission actions.  It has the feel of a Euro game in that you're always trying to optimize your limited resources based on your place in the turn order and the anticipated actions of your opponents.  The combat mechanism is decent and provides a little bit of fun randomness into a game that is well designed but, perhaps, feels a bit too much like a logisitical puzzle than a superheroic adventure.

Another big Fantasy Flight adventure style game this time jumping out of those comic book panels. Arkham Horror still remains my favorite of these types of games probably mainly because I'm more familiar with it than generic fantasy or comic books. 

If I had read comics as a kid I might have enjoyed this one more since I would have had some knowledge of who many of the characters and villains are in the Marvel Universe.

Quite a complex game overall in the vein of other Fantasy Flight games of this nature.

Pre-Ordered Sept 2006 - Arrived Dec 2006 - Traded Jul 2007

Oh, I was so wanting this to be other than what it is. Very theme rich, without a doubt, but the mechanics are rather clumsy. Some people think the rulebook is poor, but I think it is the system itself that make it that way. Every mechanic in the system makes intellectual sense but the implementation as a whole feels very clumsy, especially the assignment of hero status mechanism, the way too busy Hero Status cards, the repetative trouble level determination process, and the less than obvious dual uses of the villian cards. This is not a game to use for introducing non-gamers to the hobby, that's for certain. It also needs a fair bit of table space to spread out all the character cards, so be warned.I admire what this game tries to do and I wouldn't mind playing it again, but unfortunately it needs the right crowd, which I don't quite have right now. The clumsy, inelegant rules are really close to making me not want to try it again, but the theme and the production values of this game are top notch, so that JUST keeps the coffin from being fully nailed shut.

[Played 2 times]

Some tactical choices (but usually simple ones), decent flavour (but it is really easy to forget about it, since it is mostly just pasted on), the reduced downtime (since you can play as a "villain" when it isn't your turn) is still annoyingly prominent.
The cards, scenarios and characters increase the "replay value", but the game feels very repetitive at its core.
It is easy to customize (with your own scenarios, characters, or even a few rules to make it completely cooperative). 
Luck is present in spades (cards, dice to resolve combats and missions). 
Obviously more appealing for the Marvel comics fans.
Too repetitive and shallow to be really interesting or entertaining.
Sub-par choices: functional but really ugly board and the "reroll" icon on dice (it's easy to confound "reroll and a hit" with "two hits"... annoying).
The rulebook is very poorly organized.
The miniatures are nice.

Marvel Heroes is a game set in the Marvel Universe for 2 to 4 players, with plenty of opportunities for cooperation and competition between the Super Heroes controlled by the players. Players take control of a group of Super Heroes (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Marvel Knights or the Avengers) as well as the Nemesis of one of the other player's group (Magneto, Dr. Doom, Kingpin or Red Skull). During the game, each player finds allies, enemies and power-ups, and face the menacing Super Villains controlled by the other players.
High-quality plastic figures of many of the major Marvel Super Heroes, including Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four and The X-Men, as well as of the Nemesis characters, are included in the game. Each character featured in the game is represented by a detailed 40 mm plastic figure and an accompanying character card describing the character's special abilities. Power-ups can be added with special effects, which are different depending on who is acquiring these bonus items, so that all the different incarnations of the character can be played.

     A decent Super Heroes boardgame has finally come along.  Pretty much a resource management and combat game.  Decide which heroes and allies from a limited pool you'll use to combat various super villians played by your opponent who also has a hero team whose enemies you'll control.  Reminiscent of World of Warcraft with simpler combat and development but more control over who your opponent fights. A great game of resource management except in the end it all boils down to a bunch of dice rolls and who achieves initiative. Still fun.

It plays like a comic.

Updated: After a year I am lowering the score from a 9 to a 7.5 as we do not play it much now and the abstract nature of the game really hurts the replay value.

RATING: 10
This is one of the few games I just can't get tired of playing. The theme is very well integrated with the mechanics, and the combat system is excellent. The best dice and stats based combat system I've played on a boardgame, with an element of bluffing and outguessing your opponent that works very well. Also, each hero's super powers are well represented within the system (abstracted, of course) so each feels unique and you have to know when to use each one and how.
Also there are tons of unique villains that require different strategies (both to fight with and against them) and loads of allies that can help you in different ways, so replayability is excellent. I've been playing this game regulary for the last year and a half and it hasn't gotten old

Beneath the rubble of counterintuitive mechanics and muddled terminology, Marvel Heroes is a fairly decent game, but one that requires a great deal of effort on the part of a new group of players.

Some rules are pretty abstract, could have been much simplier, the fun part starts really when the heroes are fighting the enemies, some people that they have saw it and played it said that the the figures are the best part of the game.

I'm not a big complex mini game person, and this is one, but the theme is amazing and I couldn't pass it up. The rules take a bit to get through, and there are some fiddly bits, but there is also some great play. Players play as one team of heroes against their nemesis, controlled by the other team. That is clever.

An execrable rule book, a theme towards which I am actively hostile, multi-hour playtime, and uninspiring mechanics.  No thank you.  Never again.

better game than it plays the first time or two. a few things take a few plays to figure out properly (storyboards). we absolutly hated this game first play, but after giving it a second chance this has become a favorite for all in our playgroup but one (c'mon Roger, give it a 2nd chance!). the best part is that thanks to the scenerios the game will play different every time, and in some scenerios it is possible for all/none to win by meating pre-set requirements. great game that SCREAMS for an expansion....one is promissed but has yet to be confirmed.

The game certainly has a theme and I like the varied powers for each hero and team.  My only concern with the game is how slow it is.  When a fight occurs (especially with the Master Villian) the game just bogs down.  I can definitely see teenage boys or big time comic fans eating this up.

My first play of this game (4 completely new players with a veteran to moderate) did very little to win me over.  The systems seems overrun with information to process, while the gameplay was often time-consuming, tedious, and repetitive, not to mention the fact that the initial rules explanation was incredibly intimidating.  I really wanted to get into the theme, but the downtime was entirely unbearable: at one point, I waited over an hour to take my next turn.  I can only imagine that any subsequent plays would be better, but I really think there's just too much going on in this game for me to get excited about playing it.  I'm willing to give it another shot, but my first experience was not enjoyable.

Not what you would expect-you are managing a team of superheroes instead of playing them.  Becomes much more of a resource chasing sim than an action-packed board game.

Very complex rules for such simple strategy. To make it worst, most of the rules are very unintuitive, making the game very frustrating to explain. On the plus side, I really like how they integrated the archnemesis in there and you do feel like a band of superheroes trying to get rid of crime. Some mechanics (esp. the story track) felt very tacked on and needless. Difficult to keep track of all the information (my heroes' powers, cards in my hands, the power-ups I purchased, the other guy's powers, etc.)

Love the theme and like the game... The rules could have been more clear and better organized, but this is fantasy flight we are talking about.I think they made some of the game a little more complex than what it needed to be. The scheming part for the arch nemesis could be cleaner. They have what they can do in the rules, but also have their own special ability... they could have done with just either or...All in all, I like this game and would play it almost any time it is brought to the table.

I wish this game was maybe a turn longer.   everything seems to flow pretty well and I like that even in multiplayer there is little downtime.   I like how combat is simulated.   However, right as it feels like your team gets going, the game ends.   Maybe I will explore adding a "game ends next turn" to some of the scenario cards and see how it works.

Played ~6 times. Fun if playing with the right people with the right mood. Probably can't take it too seriously. The figures are nice. A bit strange as the map on the board basically serves no purpose at all- you can not move through the map. Seems a bit like they had a great theme and components and had to hang a game on it. I like the combat system a lot. Just think that the game could have been better. Disclaimer - I am a big comics fan and I think that helped me enjoy the game more.

Mmmh...  This game left me with an uneasy impression (I played only once).  It was designed by the same guys from War of the Ring (which I think is excellent).  But for Heroes, I think the mechanics are too abstract... We don't get the feel of the battles as we see in the comics.  But maybe after a few plays it will change.  I hope.

Meh.  And I hate saying "meh" in any case, but this game deserves it.  It's about Marvel Heroes, natch, but the game is terribly non-visceral.

Control 1 of 4 superhero teams and try to stop a major disaster from happening in New York. No wait don't just stop the disaster but be the most influential team to do so! 

Each player also controls the Nemises to another team so they can have a hand in the heroics and the villainy.

This game is dripping with story lines, encounters and tense moments. But most of all I love it because each game throws up memorable moments that will be talked about for weeks after the action has taken place.

I'm a little surprised we haven't seen a second edition of this, especially with how popular Marvel has been lately. The game is fairly straight forward, though you wouldn't know that by reading the rule book. There are a lot of minor rules to keep track of, but the game moves along at a fairly quick pace. The combat feels like the progenitor of games like Descent, and the Marvel flavor is very strong here.

Basically, it's Fantasy Flight's typical dice-based combat system without the convoluted tactical map movement.

Marvel Heroes is a fine game with some interesting mechanics.  The teams feel very unique, and there is a lot of fun fighting the various super villians and other challenges.  I don't mind dice rolling, so the combat is interesting and there are some important decisions.

There are several problems, however.  First, the rulebook is terrible.  If you want to play this game, just run through a turn or two by yourself, and you'll have it down.  Rereading the rules won't help.  Second, there isn't much interaction between the players.  Sure, you're playing enemies on your opponent, but only one person can do that, and the rest just support.  You don't get that feel of epic conflict.  Instead, each player is just sort of doing their own thing.  It's not bad for a comic book fan that appreciates tactical games, but it's not very strategic, and not for everyone.

RATING: N/A
Each player controls a group of superheroes (e.g., the Fantastic Four, Spiderman and allies, etc). You also control a villain for your left hand opponent. Play superheroes down onto the board to fight crime and earn VPs, while the other players play villians or villian support cards to prevent you from earning the VPs. There is a lot of bewildering choices when you first play the game, plus combined with the dice rolling aspect for combat, it really didn't do much for me. I suppose if you are really in the theme, it would be a fun game. I would be happy to try this again, and be in the right mood for it. The 15 pages of rules, with all sorts of special cases didn't really sit well with me.

RATING: 5
Minis are beautiful.  Game play and mechanics are somewhat weak.  I love the idea of the game and the theme is wonderful.  The card play can be a bit tedious, but it still gives you the feeling of knocking the crap out of the bad guys.  One element of the game that is truly marvelous (no pun intended) is that you get to play both the good guys and the bad guys at the same time.  Wonderful.  Why don't more games do this?  Somewhat of a saving grace for the game, IMO.

RATING: 6
Preliminary rating.  Likely to go up.  I may have to give this one the full-blown review treatment because this is a good game that could be an excellent game if only...

--update--
Massive upgrade.  Now that I'm done wrestling with the system the theme has shown through, and it is excellent!  I suspect MH is best with 2 or 3 players - you don't gain much more by having more players.  I was very pleasantly surprised how excellent it was with two!  Some excellent stuff here.  Once you've gotten through the arcane rules this game is a fantastic experience, and a two player game with experience players can be finished in two hours for the quick scenarios.  High recommendation!

--update--
Bumped down - partly because this game isn't for everyone.  The limited appeal also limits opportunity to bring it to the table.  Also, the recent round of FAQ updates were REALLY bad...and though I could always use house rules, I don't feel the game should be rewarded for something it isn't.  All subject to change.

--update---
Bumped down again.  MH has likely seen it's final play on my table.  There are some interesting concepts there but, sadly, they are drowned out by too many other mediocre ones.

The graphics are fantastic, the figurines are wonderful, the gameplay is a little lacking and the choices are pretty obvious based on which squad you pick.  This is a game I would have loved as a kid.  Also, like most FFG, the rules are a bit long in the tooth.

5 games down, and we've hit bottom.  One of the big problems is downtime, which the game tries to even-out with the nemesis partnership, but it's not enough.  For a game about supers, this game drags and simultaneously feels too short AND too long -- a marvel in itself.

Nice combat system, but the "strategic" play is rather dull, and every team seems to have one character that's only ever used when sending everyone into the fray.

There are so few superero themed games out there that I was really happy to discover that this game lived up to my expectations.

This game is just screaming for expansions, but I guess that will never happen.  Sigh.

First of all I do not like super heroes and Marvel heroes are the worst of the bunch. This game is a dice-fest where most moves are plain obvious. Modify this, modify that and throw some dice. Lots of theme but no depth. However, I had some fun and will play again if in the right mood. Moving super heroes on the board can be quite fun after few beers. Most likely kids will not like this game: it is too complex for what it is.

The occasional decision time re what to power up, what to fight and the RockPaperScissors on what to fight (all of which is fine) is drowned out by the excessive (and pure) downtime.

OK, the game has a lot of fiddley rules, but with Mr. Skeletor's flow chat, you can pick it up quick.  The theme is great, if you like comics.  If you don't like comics, I would stay away since you are not likely to want to deal with the rules.

First time I played with 3 people it took 2 hours for the standard games, that included explaining the rules.

Simply one of the most fun, and in my opinion, best designed superhero themed games available, if you can find it. It has been out of print for a long time, and is sometimes hard to find used. But if you can find it, you will not be sorry. Just download the unofficial patch to iron out what few wrinkles this game has.

I don't see any of the game balance problems other people seem to be talking about.  The game does depend on familiarity with Marvel Comics and a good imagination for it to be fun.  There is a dryness to the threat/troubleshooting mechanic that you have to fill in with your imagination.  I still like it.

A very cool game about these comic heroes. The game itself is very thematic with lots of dice shuffling and a high amount of luck. But it lasts waaaay too long. Our first 4 player game lasted 4 1/2 hours.

I detrattori dei german games dicono che sono giochi astratti con un'ambientazione appiccicata sopra: è quello che penso - da ex lettore di fumetti Marvel - dell'orrendo Marvel Heroes. Non bastano le figurine dipinte e le carte a tema per poter dire che un gioco è calato nell'ambientazione. La mappa, oltre ad essere esteticamente brutta, è praticamente inutile ai fini di un gioco nel quale tutto ruota intorno a numeri: la missione da completare? Numeri. I supereroi? Numeri, n8umeri, numeri. Il combattimento? Si confrontano i numeri e si fanno ruzzolar dadi, facendo finta di giocare a uno "strategico", che tradotto significa "scegliere il supereroe che ti fa tirare un dado in più".
Il sistema di gioco è un ripetitivo sasso-carta-forbici, inframezzato di eccezioni e regolette particolari che lo spezzettano. Le carte "storia" sembrano inserite in un secondo momento per rendere meno monotono il gioco. Il fattore fortuna è assolutamente sproporzionato e mette in secondo piano la "strategia". L'interazione tra giocatori è minima. A mio parere, il PEGGIOR gioco del 2006, se non il peggior gioco a cui abbia mai giocato. Se questa è la new wave italiana del gioco da tavolo, ridatemi Lo Zio d'America.

OWN Jan/07: unplayed, but my 7-year-old son is already drooling over the bits, rules, etc.

I've tried to play at least twice now.  Could use a summary of when the power-boosting is in effect, what the benefits are for supporting heroes (just power-boosting?), and what the drawbacks are for the Mastermind villians (just a potential power-up?) given that they can add to the fights & be difficult to beat.

I didn't get from the rules that you could do more than 1 fight in a round.  I also missed the multi-heroes in one zone rules (they are there).  I'll have to try again, but it certainly seems less strategic now, and more battling.  Should be quicker to get more points, and thus, more plot points.  Makes more sense now to play those level 3s.

My rating at this point is as much a guide as to the frustration of the rules.

I waited a long time to be able to play this and unfortunately wasn't impressed at all.
That's bad, since I like the theme. I'm not a big fan of Marvel Comics or anything, but I still enjoy these little buddies.

Some of the little mechanics in game are just too complex given what they are. For example the boost icons and the player team / nemesis system. They tend to destroy your head, or the explanation was lacking just in my opinion...

Coloring is as bright as the theme requires. Cards are a bit messy, but the board is clear. I didn't like the way in the game when the first players usually got the best places. Also, too much is dependent on that trouble level roll of yours. 

Too many flaws, which is shame. I would've wanted to like this.

I love this theme, however the rules are overly complex, it takes aleast an hour for it to click with newbies, till then not much fun, but when they finally get it, then the fun goes into high gear. I remember running games at a con, someone asked if I could teach them this one, and I had to say "NO", this is not a good game to learn at a con. 


I had to drop my rating on this game, just because its such a pain in the ass to teach to people.

This game has such a fantastic theme that it fails to employ on so many levels. If you want to enjoy this game, you have to houserule so many aspects in order to make it actually play in 90 minutes. Sorry, very few games are worth two hours of my time, and this one never is. Worst rulebook ever - you will be scratching  your head over a lot of tiny, easy to miss rules. Also, it's barely a board game. They easily could have done away with the miniatures and the board and made this a card game with nothing lost. Huge disappointment.

The game is very different from what I was expecting; I mean, speaking of Marvel Heroes my thoughts were about an 'ameritrash' game, with tons of dice rolling, clash of powers and combats. This game is different, more on the slow way, strategic (as written on the box, after all). Everything considered I appreciated it, also if I have to play it again. Very good components.

I think the main reason this game gets low reviews is due to the rulebook. The rulebook is easily the worst part of the game - once you are past that then it is a fantastic game.

I was a bit wary of this one...I was worried that underneath the shiny theme was an abstract strategy game.  Well, to some extent, this is true. For example, when deciding which headlines to tackle and with what heroes, your decision is based mostly on matching the type of headline with the hero who specializes in that type.  You don't just send Spidey in because he's Spidey.  However, I do think the theme can shine through if you let it.  I love the diversity of heroes/villians/allies, and it's fun to imagine them all duking it out.  The mechanics are pretty solid, and I like that it is more strategic than tactical.  I don't particularly like the generic headlines (Oh no! Jewel Thieves strike Mid-town Manhattan!), nor their generic look (couldn't spring for some art to accompany those headlines?).  Having multiple scenarios, however, is a plus (but again, no accompanying art).  It should maintain it's appeal for a good while.

Although there are many choices and nuances to manage, the game does not seem to ask you to keep track of them all at once, because the gameplay is very well segmented and transitions from phase to phase well.  It's the nuances of when X ability applies and of how Y situation should resolve that are giving people fits now while the game is still new.  I can see that once someone has a dozen or so plays under their belt, this will move much more fluidly and quickly.

Revisiting my rating, I must lower the score, because while I find the rules not so complicated as the public outcry would suggest, I did have trouble recalling when each mechanic applied after not having played the game in two months.  Further, the opponent's team are the real threat in the game, not the villains and masterminds, and that feels very off theme to me.

I actually recognise most of the villians and heroes in this game, years after reading my last comic. Hooray for the Punisher! The theme is a winner for me, far better than SF or horror pulp.

Combat is rather drawn out with four players and I can see it getting repetitive, but if all four players know how it's done and can guarantee me a game in under two hours, count me in. Nice story telling arc involved too. Works well enough two player, but the board needs to be a little more crowded to add to the tension of troubleshooting missions.

RATING: 8
Despite a few clunky mechanics and many complaints from friends, I've gotten a lot of play out of this one... excellent bits that capture the comic theme... the combat system is very cool... unfortunately, it's weighed down by less than ideal mechanics overall (plot points, villain ratings, story cards, and so on)... a little steamlining and this might have been a 9 or 10... with the right group and a solid understanding of the rules, this is a good choice for Marvel fans

You must understand that the theme has a lot to do with this rating.  I am a sucker for Marvel Comic themes.  This is the game that I have been waiting for...for what seems like my entire life.  It wonderfully blends the game mechanics with the Marvel universe.  If the game had a different theme (say a dungeon crawl or space explorers or whatever), I'd probably give it an 8.  Still a good game, but the theme makes is a 9 for me.

If you like Marvel Comics, you will like this game.  A lot.

As typical of FFG games, there are a million rules to remember, tons of great bits, and a big heavy box for this game.

Plays in 2-3 hours with four players.

Good superhero games are few and far between and the tendency of Marvel to sell a license to all and sundry doesn't help to promote quality.
The game components are professional but the art-work and design are amateurish making it look more like a proto-type than the finished game. The game-play is similar, involving a lot of different bits, some of them apparently tacked on to solve problems with the basic game (for example a story card mechanism that gradually gives all players points, thus ensuring the game cannot be stalemated).
Combat is resolved by rolling dice and just feels horribly random (there are strategy elements in setting up the right support, but the apparent strategy elements in combat make little difference). Since 3-4 combats for each player will decide the game there is little or no strategy in the game.
One for the fans only.

The theme is the only reason to play this and even that part they failed to portray in this game. It has the weirdest gameplay ever and it's not enitrely clear what the designers idea of a superhero was. It's like they had the idea for the game and pasted on the theme later on. You know, like they tried to combine an amerigame with a eurogame. Only they got stuck with the worst of the two worlds, like a bad cross-over.

Having recently tackled some relatively complex wargames, after 4 solo plays of Marvel Heroes I found the rules that come with this game to be very straight forward and easy to pick up, producing a fun, light, well balanced game that is very solo friendly.

The mechanics feel very original and the whole experience is extremely heavy on theme, whilst the limited number of turns (5 max) really raise the tension, making every decision taken key to the success of your team.

I may change my view with further plays but at the moment nothing seems to be broken with this engaging quick playing game and I know that there are also fan created rules out there which are said to add some improvements which I'll likely start including in future plays.

For me personally, this game has so much to offer with lots of replay value given the large percentage of cards, characters and situations that never make it into each game. I have the impression that I am only scratching the surface with just 4 solo plays under my belt and at the moment am very reluctant to pack everything away which is always the sign of a good game :)

Played once.  I like War of the Ring very much.  I did not like Marvel Heroes very much.  With WotR, I had the feeling of an epic quest, oozing with theme.  With MH, I had the feeling of solving a math problem, playing rock-paper-scissors, and rolling dice over and over again.  The rules seemed overly complex, and the amount of enjoyment was not worth the amount of work.  Played a four-player game.  Granted we were all learning, but the rule book was referred to constantly, resulting in a 5  hour game.  Two enjoyed it immensely; one got second place without ever really understanding what he was doing for the entire game.  "You should do this, then that, then the other thing."  "Why?"  "It's hard to explain.  Just do it."

I've tried and tried to enjoy this game...   I love Comics and in the begining the theme appealed to me.  However, the mechanics of this game are really shallow...  it works but reduces much of the fun to an excercise in  math and probability.  

My biggest problem is that the villains are either laughably easy to defeat or impossible...  often, it doesn't feel like the game has a middle ground.

Also, the teams are far from balanced.  I've not played a game where the avengers are present and did not win by a ridiculous margin.

A little dissapointed by the lack of strategic options in this. Seems to play pretty much on it's on. You really have only a few rational choises to choose from. Also the convoluted and poorly written rules bring this one down. The game is pretty easy and simple to play, but the horrible rule book make the game seem awfully complex.
On the plus-side this is one of the best license games I've seen. Nexus really has a good track record on these.

I admit, I bought this game only because I am a huge Marvel Comics fan.  But I am disappointed with this game.  The rules are complex and hard to explain, and even when you get the rules down the game just isn't that fun.  Too much dice rolling - and the teams aren't well balanced in my opinion.  The Marvel Heroes team is best by far because of Spider Man.  The board itself is ugly to boot.  The one redeeming factor in this game are prepainted miniatures.  They are well made.  But don't buy this game just for the miniatures like I apparently did...

After having taught the game at a recent convention (barely knowing it myself since I'd only played once before, many months ago) and then playing a 3 player game at the same convention I have a greater appreciation for the game.  I still don't get the "super hero vibe" from the game but better understand what the designers were driving for (I think.)  Lots of options and combinations present themselves when deciding how to outfit the team and then adding the allies and using events to make them more effective.

Putting up a good fight with one of your heroes or putting the smack down with a weak villain because of good card play and luck is quite fun.  While this isn't a game I will play all the time I will see if I can get it to the table more in the future.

RATING: 7
Even when this is supposed to be an adventure game, it doesn't feel like one.  In fact, some may say it is really a card game with a prior activation phase, similar to those in collectible card games, but poorer in options.  That because the characters of adventure games like to wander around gaining strength, wisdom and items to develop themselves and be able to perform a major task.  In Marvel Heroes your characters are in some sort of headquarter seeing where the alarms are ringing in order to plan their moves and go out to turn the fires off.  There is no wandering, no ability gaining and no looting.  Nevertheless, there is something like a team development as you score points that will allow you bring more Superheroes with you next time.  Besides, you may also get team advantages that will make your group to get better, and you may be able to complete parts of your Archenemy master plan to gain new powers.  So, the development that we are talking about can be compared with renovated efforts and new resources at disposal due to your team or bad guy success. Speaking of other things, it is also true that the game gives you some advantages over the average adventure games:  strategy, options and decisions.  Planning which Superheroes to activate and who to bring in support depending of the stats of the different emergencies is nice.  It is also a good thing that the encounters are not determined by luck, since players can take some decisions in order to set the villain that will fight and his/her supports.  There is room also for strategy in combat, with different stats to chose from and some nice special abilities.  I only wish that there weren't that many places where to look for dice and results and rules variations, since there are tons of cards where they can be, but even that way the combat feels great and it is the heart and soul of the game.  Bottom line:  This game maybe have taken some of the good parts of adventure games off, like wandering, looting and character development, but in the other hand gives you planning, more control, tough decisions, team development and puts you in charge of the oposition against your play mates.  The balance is good.  A special note about the components: there aren't better that these.

I give this game a 4 for the time being...I have attempted to read the rules 5 times, and each time I turn away by the third section. I have never played the game. I normally relish in reading the rules for games; because this game's rules have so far been too burdensome to read I give the game preliminary bad marks.

Marvel Heroes -- 

Thornquist's GenCon 2006 Wrap-Up
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I really want to like this game for the theme. However, the game is mired in many levels of clunky mechanics that actually detracts from the very reason why I like it! Expect to constantly refer to rules in the first few games and struggle with trying to figure out how things work. Sure, they work ok as a whole but one just doesn't get the experience of running a superhero team around NY.

Think of your heroes as resources you assign to complete missions. Each hero has stats that are used to reduce trouble levels. What's left of the level is used by opponents to deploy villains (clever) and combat is a 'rock paper scissors'-style choosing of stats.

Components are colourful and fun to look at although I wish the art was new instead of being taken from existing sources. The game can drag with more players and I suspect that 3 might be the sweet spot. It's also a pity the game doesn't allow for character development.

I hope that it improves with continued play but as it stands, it's hard to rate it higher for the moment.

An admirable effort, but the result is just too cumbersome for my taste. I'd much rather play Capes & Cowls or X-Men Alert. Among my favorite superhero games, Marvel Heroes comes in fourth, right behind Heroes Incorporated.

RATING: 5
I was a true Marvel Superhero fan when I was younger. For the nostalgia alone I would love to see a decent Marvel-game. Regrettably Marvel Heroes fails to be that game, which is sad as I'm pretty sure the developers really tried their best. The rules are straightforward, but marred with many (for me) pointless actions, sub-rules and exceptions. Playing the game feels overall just pointless and unexciting to me.

The heroes don't feel like themselves in battle but rather generic, one throws more dice one less. And fundamentally the idea of competing superhero teams that don't help each other is just plain un-Marvel. I'd rather see a game where some players control villains and some heroes. 

And yeah, the rulebook is not the best, but that is sadly almost standard fare in these type of newer FFG games. The artwork is pretty good, but the figures look like cheap toys (don't make minis, if they are medicore crap).

RATING: 5.5
I wanted this to be better than the other Fantasy Flight games.  I thought with the theme and such it might inspire them to stray away from exessively fiddly mechanics and overly complex rules.  Unfortunately, that's just not the case.  Top notch components, a playable game, but not sleek or elegant by any stretch of the imagination.  Decent, but far from great.

RATING: 6
Action Point, Skirmish, Missions. This has a good overall feel to it, although the rules could use a bit of streamlining (or a really good player aid). I like that it isn't necessarily just pure bashing combat. Choosing the attack type to use offers a nice decision point to combat, although it is dice-heavy.

RATING: 5
Marvel Heroes is a difficult game for me to rate. Deciding whether to play it is like deciding whether to cook a seven course meal of food you don't like for complete strangers. The experience possesses certain rewards: doing the job well, earning the admiration of others, joy in the act, and so forth; yet the work itself is also rather complicated and you may not be that interested in cooking the food for the sake of eating it. In cooking, everything must be timed to precision in preparing a meal with so many courses. You must also cope with chance details such as guest #3's allergy to milk. It's rather difficult to do with only one cook. Everything must be served hot, and must be served at the right *time*. In Marvel Heroes, which is very nearly "doing your taxes with super heroes" when it comes to the rules, you must pay close attention to the those very involved rules, which strike me as even more involved than those of Arkham Horror. As with cooking for strangers, there is a strong chance element to success. Will you please them with your cooking/win Marvel Heroes? It ends up largely the result of a die role. That's how Marvel Heroes feels: a lot of difficult work wherein it is easy to forget a step, at the end of which your success is determined by chance.

Doesn't sound very appealing, does it? This game feels like the designers were sitting around a table and one guy said, "Our game should have victory points!" In went victory points. Someone else said, "Our game should have *teams* of heroes." In went teams. "Our game should have...
* A rock, paper, scissors combat system...with DICE!
* Some kind of story track with story cards which can bequeath victory points.
* Super villains!
* Villians, allies, agents, etc.
* Various power up cards for villians, heros, and arch villians!
* Two tiers of rounds to keep track of.
* Different possible scenarios.
* Little figurines!
* And more!

It feels like elements just kept getting added until the game became "complex enough" to be a respectable board game. But playing the game required us to check the rules every time we did something, even when we repeated an action, because there were just so many little details to keep in mind.

But there are assuredly good things about Marvel Heroes. Once you have a solid grasp of the rules, you can relish kicking some villain ass. Each player controls both a team of heroes and a super villain, and there are some very clever touches. To wit...well, they're hard to explain because they are so detailed, but suffice it for me to say that the designers have built some nice checks and balances into the game.

Even though some of your heroes' special abilities are a bit too generic, the game and its materials did really get my blood flowing. If you like comics, and you like gaming, you will be able to enjoy this game even if you aren't a fan of the rules. The miniatures are lovely, the graphic design and art is gorgeous, and it IS fun to fight with your little dudes. On the other hand, I think fighting with little HeroScape dudes is more fun, so far as that goes.

As with cooking a difficult meal, Marvel Heroes offers up certain pleasures - both in the doing, and in the completion. Fighting with super heroes is flavorful and fun, just like cooking (if you like to cook!). And having your plan come together under the favoring eye of Fate is also very satisfying. You just have to ask yourself whether it is worth the trouble. For my part, I think Nexus' Age of Conan is a MUCH more enjoyable game. I would not suggest a game of Marvel Heroes, but I would play it if a group of people really wanted to mix it up with heroes and villains. It was pretty awesome when I used Iron Man to kick Ultron's metal butt.

I can't tell you how much I wanted to love this game. The artwork is gorgeous. The figures are great. There is action, battles, villains, superheroes... yet it never really comes together in a coherent manner. The board serves really no purpose. The whole team management aspect is fiddly. The rules are not intuitive at all. Out if maybe 4 or 5 tries with this game, I was never able to actually finish one and every time I tried it, after a few rounds everyone just gave up and wanted to play another game or leave. Too bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
For a game that supposedly focuses so much on characters, there really is no story here.  The game talks of solving crimes and mysteries, but all of the colorful text here just feels like card suits (diamonds, spades, hearts).  You never do anything particularly superhero-y. You just teleport on and off a board gaining VP chips based on what stats match yours, who has what cards and what gets rolled.  This is just too abstracted for a Superhero game. Most of this game is resource management, where you are just adjusting stats.  

There is very little interaction between characters, and the way that the game "fixes" this feels forced.  If you are going to give each player their own bad guy let them actually play the bad guy.  It's ok if the Red Skull fights the FF, in fact it is cooler than the same old match-up over and over again.  Why aren't there team-ups?  I should be able to force shared points by sending Storm in to team-up with Thor (Together again for the first time: Lightning Strikes Twice!). This is the interaction that the game desperately needs.

The game has some good ideas, but as it is they are just buried deeply beneath a clunky, rule-heavy system.  The pace grinds and spurts along like an old jalopy.  I feel that the designers glopped on  "fixes" to the game until it worked rather than manipulating what was already there.  There is about 5 lbs of meat on a 15 lb cut; the rest -- fat.   

I'm not entirely sure why you should waste your time on the big bad-guys as the game is usually over in a couple lucky victories, before they can actually be a threat. 

The biggest flaw of the game is that there is nothing evocative about these characters other than the way their attacks are titled.  They don't feel like super heroes and they don't do anything heroic. Daredevil doesn't feel like the blind protector of Hell's Kitchen when you are using rock paper scissors to decide which variant of the Runebound attach system you will use. Would Stick have taught Matt Murdoch to choose the red, orange or yellow attack type in this situation?  Mr Fantastic doesn't stretch he modifies die rolls, but then so does Thor and Dr. Strange. Often their special powers work in the same ways, which makes none of these characters feel special.  And what the heck is "support" simulating.

These characters could all be different dogs in a junkyard, squirrels in the park or lab rats in a cage. If they didn't come with a plastic figure and a card with their name and picture on it, you would never know which character was which.  You beat stats then the stats disappear, you don't beat stats then those stats disappear.  You are rewarded with story points rather than offered a story.  There is no plot only the blind accumulation of VPs.

Someone please inform me of what a great move is in this game. Most moves seem straight forward and feel standard obvious and mindless, those that aren't are minor adjustments to the way the dice are rolled so that you are just adjusting odds and end up as arbitrary and completely luck dependent die rolls.  Very disappointing.

'Nuff Said.

Complex.  Much more complex than it looks at first glance.  Many kids whom are attracted to the box won't be able to figure out the game.

Great theme, but the game...
- takes way too long. 
- has too many niggly little rules ... pages and pages and pages!
- has too much randomness: the combinations of headlines that come up, the story card sequence, and TONS of dice-rolling!

After 2nd play with someone familiar with the rules, will bump this 4-->5. Could get higher if played more quickly.

I've had a really tough time deciding how I feel about Marvel Heroes.  On the one hand, it is an extremely detailed game (I can't even imagine the effort that went into designing it), with a very large cast of characters and a whole bunch of really cool painted plastic heroes (and a few villains).  On the other hand, it (along with "War of the Ring" by the same team of designers) is perhaps the most complicated game I have ever played (which probably says more about the types of games I have played than about the game itself), it takes several hours to play through a scenario, and it has the most poorly constructed board I have ever encountered (by the end of the first play, the board was fairly badly warped and the top layer was peeling off).  So the difficult part for me has been deciding whether the thoroughness and coolness of the game out-weighs the complexity and length.  Ultimately I realized that they could have solved this whole issue by creating a set of basic rules and used the game as it stands now as advanced rules.  As it is, only a very serious gamer would really enjoy this game.  I wish I had purchased "Marvel Heroscape" instead.  That game at least has the speed and excitement that SHOULD be associated with a superhero game.  [I have realized, much to my amusement, that the initial rating I had  given this game was the same rating as the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Game".  "Marvel Heroes" was very well designed but the fun factor got buried beneath all the rules, whereas the Turtles game was very simplistic yet fun and fast to play.]  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5/10

I can see why people really like this game.  It has a lot of theme that is captured very well with the all the cards and figures, and the battle system allows for some choices that relate to character powers.  In the end though, all that wears off pretty quick as the game becomes very mechanistic.  In other words, I felt like I was simply repeating a lot of moves over and over to advance in the game.  As time went on, it felt less and less like fighting superheroes and more like playing the card game war or something with neat looking cards due to all the repetition.  Given the high ratings this game gets, however, my reaction may just be me rather than the game itself.  Thus your experience may be much better than mine.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I played the first basic learning scenario, in a four player game.  I was the X-men team.  I took second place.  I did come down to the very last turn of the game to decide the win.  I really did enjoy look playing and look forward to trying some of the more "advanced" scenarios.  The most interesting part was how one minute you would be a team against one of the other players, and the next minute you were the one everyone else is teaming against (as villians).  There was a lot of stuble strategy that I seemed to pick up on just a turn to slow.  I made a lot of mistakes where after I did something then I saw the more efficent way or ordering or playing it.  One play was not enough for me to get a good feel for any of the game team balance or replay value.  It did take a while to play, 4 hours to play   30 min to learn the rules.

A great looking game which captures some of the feel I was hoping for.

This was just a terrible experience for me. Granted, as a card-carrying Eurosnoot, I wasn't expecting alot going in. I guess what I *was* expecting was theme. This is an abstract exercise in modifier manipulation. If I can't play my elegant games full of colored cubes, at least let me *feel* like a super hero. We were well into our third hour before the game mercifully ended. On at least two ocassions during the game I had nothing to do for 20  minutes -- and that's a kind time estimate.

This game is incredibly fun if you like comics.  You have a team of heroes (xmen, avengers, fantastic 4, etc) and lots of threats all over Manhattan that you can choose to engage or not. You devise your strategy based on the heroes abilities and then there's all kinds of random stuff that can happen with dice and cards and your opponents throwing in other villains to up the stakes. You also play your opponents' nemesis (red skull, dr doom, etc) and try and thwart their plans to save the day. If you read comics and love the marvel characters, this is a must play!

Played 1+ times. Wow. Played in a Gencon demo.  Dripping with Theme.  As a comic fan I would say this is an automatic buy for me.  As for the game, I'm not sure that it's great.  There were a lot of dice rolled, but we didn't get to play a full game.  I'm looking forward to trying out the different victory conditions and seeing how the superheros and super villains affect the dynamics of play. *UpDATE* This game is great.  The demo-er got it pretty much right   and I enjoy the theme a lot.  The game is pretty short (read # of battles not time to play) and there's not a lot of time to even out the luck of the dice rolls, but it's pretty fun. My board is warped BADDLY and won't lay flat though. 2008/11/28

Admittedly, I've only played once. But I'm not too eager to play again. EXTREMELY "fiddly." I got the sense that designers had a shopping list of 20 different aspects of comics books, and they were determined to hammer them all into the game. Play was laboriously slow, and there was a distinct lack of "action." It just didn't capture the Marvel Comics "feel." Very disappointing.

My first play of this didn't go so well.  The rulebook had to be referrenced way too much, and both of us sort of lost interest.  I am looking to give it another chance, however.  Being a superhero game and all...and the mini's really make this game!  I re-read the rules and am looking to give it another go.

First Play rating at this point.  We played a full four player game and it took about 3 hours from start to finish using the first scenario.  This game (like quite a few FF games) takes a bit more to explain up front.  I rarely find a game from them where I can describe just a couple of rules and then play through a round showing them how it works.  I will have too much advantage as all the exceptions come into play during the first turn.  I have found it better to describe it all up front rather then them playing and then my retracting an otherwise excellent move on their part after explaining a rule.

Overall we all enjoyed playing.  Wtth four players at least we noticed some downtime for the two players not involved in headline resolution (especially during the battle).  However this game is quite unique in play and feel which is  a positive.  It will take a couple more playthroughs for me to make a nice solid rating on this.  All I know for now is that I am ready to play it again, with some trepidation.

Second game was much better with three players.  I think that is the sweet spot with this game IMHO

Despite coming from an Italian design team and publisher, this game screams Ameritrash dice fest. Not that that's inherently a bad thing, but Marvel Heroes does have many of same flaws that tend to crop up with American game designs. The rules are dauntingly confusing and the rulebook is very poorly set up, such that even experienced gamers are likely to be getting things wrong or forgetting little rules well into their second game. The chrome adds flavor, but the game is definitely fiddly and overlong for what it is. The balance between the teams is off, as well, forcing people play all sorts of house rules to "fix" things like the "brokenly powerful" Fantastic 4 team. In the end, I'm torn. Despite all the drawbacks, the game is fun. The theme is rich, the characters as colorful as you remember from their comic books and the bits are wonderful. I like some parts of the game very much (while others are fiddly and tedious), and WANT to like it even more. As things stand, I can't see this getting played much, and I'm certainly not going to get it back on the table with my game group, who found it confusing and dull. It's going on the trade pile, but with reluctance. All in all, this is a near miss, and I can't help but think a little streamlining and some simplification of some of the more fiddly aspects of the game would have resulted in far superior offering.

At the end of the day, Marvel Heroes is a fiddly resource management game, lacking any of the excitement and punch you'd want in a superhero game. Still, don't dismiss this game if you're a Marvel fan or are looking for a game that feels totally different from others. Definitely for gamers only.

RATING: 3.5
Man, oh man.  What a missed opportunity.  

A disappointingly dry exercise despite the flashy theme and cool minis.  It's not even that great a strategy game because the complicated rules and confusing language (threat, trouble, troubleshooting... *snore*) keep the gameplay from becoming second nature and allowing the strategy and/or theme to take center stage.  Perhaps it gets a lot smoother once it becomes more intuitive, but I don't have the interest to slog through it and get to that point.

I also think the designers did a poor job of implementing any kind of narrative structure to the game.  The combat is thematic, but the stories, headlines, and scenarios have pretty much no flavour to them.  The worst offender is the victory points.  What are these supposed to represent?  I'd be into this game so much more if the end goal was defeating the arch nemesis.  THAT'S what most memorable super hero comics are all about and THAT'S how a player should win the game.  I don't want to recreate some generic 60s-style story with Spider-Man catching some diamond thieves.  I want Infinity Gauntlet! 

The downtime while other players are troubleshooting and going through combat can be really, really boring.  I watched a combat between Kingpin and Dr. Strange go for five rounds of combat (which is a loooong time -- that's 30 dice rolls plus all the other considerations that go into that combat, plus the troubleshooting stage to get to this point), but it was never tense, or fun, or interesting.  It was just long.  This is probably best with 2 players so that you're always involved.

Despite my complaints, it's a game I'm willing to occasionally play because I'm a comic nerd and I do enjoy building a hand of villain and ally cards.  Hopefully I'll come to enjoy it for what it is but, right now, it scratches the wrong itch.

I wanted to like it so much and it was ok but only ok. Lovely figures but very abstract concepts and poor execution made a lot of things feel bolted on. Several elements just didn't feel like they contributed much to the game, would have been much better simplified a bit and with some more (any) onus on character powers. A missed opportunity.

Put the things I really don't like in games, downtime,fiddliness, and long length.  Make the theme about superheroes.  Make cool minis and fantastic artwork on the cards.  Fun special powers for everyone.   You have me sold.  Losing a battle seems like its too much to come back from.  I really like how it does its job.  Much much fun.   

My initial enthusiasm was crushed by the games mechanics.  One of my biggest disappointments in my gaming is how much I didn't like playing this the second time.

This game is quite fun...a helluva lot of fun in fact.  I can honestly see that if you are not a comic book fan that it might not be as much for you (you poor pathetic thing you) as it is for the rest of us (most highly enlightened ones.)  Anyway back to what I was saying.  This game rocks and is great fun, much more fun than a 6 rating would lead you to believe.  But it take too friggin long to play. Honestly that is the big (and it's big in this one if you ask me) downfall for this game. 2 hours is definitely a good stated play time as once you got it down that's what it's going to take but the first few plays 3 hours easy...still 2 hours is a bit much for me.

RATING: 7
There's enough player interaction to make it interesting, but not enough to keep all the players occupied all the time.  While the box says 90 minutes for a game, it took my group 4 hours to complete our first game, including reading the rules, and we didn't make it the full 5 rounds before the game was over.  I expect in future plays we can whittle this down to 2 to 2.5 hours, since we're not familiar with how the game is played.

RATING: 4
I was pretty disappointed with Marvel Heroes.  The components are fabulous, but the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired.  I'm a big advocate of games only lasting as long as they should, and this game lasts far longer than it ought to.  I don't mind playing a long game of Die Macher or another game that has enough meat to keep it interesting, but this game takes far too long for what it offers.  It is essentially a dice-fest, but adds in far too many rules complexities, making the game bog down and drag.  It might be slightly better for big fans of the source material, but I'm not sure.  The other problem is that the board is completely irrelevant because there is almost no player interaction.  You simply place a unit on the board to fight against a randomly drawn card from the enemy deck, and then take your unit back, over and over again.  It would be fine if it was shorter and simpler so it could do what it does best, but instead it's caught in a no man's land of being neither short enough nor heavy enough.

Gah!  This game is the definition of fiddly for me.  Several different types of cards, chits, "troubleshooting" as an action that means to do battle, and a "trouble" track that seems completely opposite of the way it should go.  Modify this, modify that, use a special ability?  Plus the flavor text is useless.

After a few plays, this game has grown on my girlfriend and I tremendously.  It is deep enough to be interesting, but simple enough to play through without sacrificing a whole evening.  We've had the chance to play with 3-4 players, and the game works well with multiple teams.

It has a cool dynamic where you are able to play powers or abilities on the supervillain that the other player is trying to defeat, so everyone stays involved.  I have read that several people feel the Fantastic Four is broken, but after several plays I haven't found this to be the case.

Highly reccomended for anyone who is into comics or light strategy gaming.

Edit - 5/7/09: Started using some of the house rules on the geek to add a greater sense of  "comic book flavor" to the experience, and it worked really well.  It gives the random bad guys a bit more personality and longevity.

Having had this game for more than a year before playing it, I had ample opportunity to read all the posts regarding missing or ambiguous rules, obvious flaws, or even that the game was broken, before doing so. 

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, I was impressed with the game. I, and the people I played it with (all of us playing for the first time), felt that it played smoothly, and provided for a very enjoyable gaming experience. 

I look forward to more plays. This is a great game!

Marvel Heroes is a game set in the Marvel Universe for 2 to 4 players, with plenty of opportunities for cooperation and competition between the Super Heroes controlled by the players. Players take control of a group of Super Heroes (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Marvel Knights or the Avengers) as well as the Nemesis of one of the other player's group (Magneto, Dr. Doom, Kingpin or Red Skull). During the game, each player finds allies, enemies and power-ups, and face the menacing Super Villains controlled by the other players.

Now I understand the rules better, it is quite a fun (and sometimes amazingly tense) game. Good use of theme, and each choice and rule (whilst appearing quite arbitrary at the start) has a meaning and is part of an intricate system. Do I try and increase the threat level so I can surprise Daredevil with Dormammu? Do I bring in Nightcrawler to help Hulk with those pesky Outwit rolls? Even the much derided story track has its part to play (it helped me win by one point.) And the battles can become truly mighty contests like back in the old Lee/Kirby days. Now that I understand the game better, I think it's a real winner. But, in all honesty, it's pretty much only for fans of the comics.

     Ugh.  I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  I love comic books and superheroes, and I'm a huge fan of the classic Marvel stories of the eighties and early nineties.  But this game just isn't a whole lot of fun.

     The attention and detail to the Marvel theme is really nice.  Impressive even.  But in the end it's just impressive window dressing.  The gameplay itself just seems so abstract and pointless.  

     Another BGG member has used the phrase "going through the motions" when referring to this game, and I have to agree.  It perfectly describes how I felt while waiting for the game to mercifully end.

The rule book was a horribly obtuse but once we muddled our way through a few rounds we had a fun game.  The second play I had totally forgotten the first play and again, the rules are so obtuse, it frustrated me.

Marvel Heroes is a mixed bag. Everything is high quality, as I have come to expect from Fantasy Flight Games. The super hero miniatures are great, on par with any Heroclix release, and the art work on the cards does a great job of portraying the various heroes and villians in the game. The prettiness stops at the game board however, as it is easily one of the ugliest I have ever seen. While I suppose it is meant to evoke the line drawn maps that were often used in the intro pages of classic comic books, it is jarringly bad enough that I wish they would have just stuck with labeled boxes or even dispensed with the board altogether and made this a straight card game.

The game is, strangely enough, an Italian design. I was certainly interested to see how European game designers would approach an American institution like comic book heroes. After all, super hero stories are all about fighting, while most Eurogames are decidedly not. What I found was a very uneven game.

For starters, this IS a card game, despite the fact it comes in a giant box. By far the most interesting aspect of the game is the play of ally and villian cards. Recruiting henchmen and fighting the recurring "Most wanted" villians are the highlight of the game both strategically and thematically. Everything else that the game tries to do falls flat.

The board and miniatures are almost completely unnecessary. They do nothing more than mark the area the hero has been assigned to or the special power they have chosen to use. The story track is both useless and boring, a mechanic that basically just lets you trade actions for victory points, and the combat system is flat out bad.

Combat in Marvel Heroes is essentially rock, paper, scissors. Except in this game, paper ALWAYS loses. This of course leaves rock and scissors, and as everyone knows...nothing beats rock. In other words, combat is not nearly as interesting as it should be.
You either:
1. choose the big attack / low defense option
2. choose the big defense / low attack option or
3. choose the equally balanced attack and defend option

Hint: For the vast majority of Heroes, non-committal option 3 ALWAYS LOSES!

For obvious reasons, a super hero game with bad combat rules is dead in the water. My group just could not get excited about Marvel Heroes. Even after a couple of plays, many of the game's mechanics felt clumsy and out of place. Worse, at no time did it ever feel like we were duking it out in an epic comic book battle. I think this could have been something better with a little development work, but as it stands it simply missed its mark.

If this game proves anything, it's that super heroes and eurogames go together like garlic and chocolate. Yummmmmm...

The core is a simple game obscured by pointless complexity. But the core is too simple to support enough genuine differentiation, so you get this flurry of modifiers and tempo changes, but everything and everyone ends up feeling the same.

It's not a hopeless case, and it can capture some of the comic story arc, but it's just a waste of potential.  I mean, if you bother to make a game complex (and it is), then use that complexity to generate interesting choices and/or thematic richness (and it doesn't).

Really fun game that does put you in a marvel interest atmosphere. It's a well thought out system in my opinion and I enjoy how it works out the nemesis thing, it stops games of 4-people making teams between one another or ganging up on each other. 
I'd also have to say that it's balanced and quite fun.
My brother also played with me and my friend and he's not a marvel fan (In fact he hates most of the marvel characters), so I can assure you there was no bias review from him when he said it was quite good.

A must have for the Marvel and superhero fans.  Otherwise it's still a good game with interesting mechanisms where you use your heroes and supporting cards to solve situations that will yeild points.

It plays out at more of a strategic level with actions unfolding much like a comic book story.

Highly recomended if you like comics.

There are some problems, mainly the rulebook is horrid. Get someone to teach you. I love it enough that I'll overlook it's flawed rulebook. Headless hollow has a nice summary.

I read up this game before and heard that it was obtuse and difficult to learn. It was mainly a card game with a board for putting cards.

Well, my first game was an epic struggle.. with the rules! But after that it played quite well once we got into the groove of it. There is a lot stuff going on, undoubtably, but the theme of it really does come through.

If you are with players who dig Marvel and can get past the hurdle of that first game (deep breaths, take it slow..) then it may just be a game you love. I imagine I would have liked it a lot more when I was going through my big comicbook phase in my late teens/early twenties.
The painted mini's are incredible though!

RATING: 9
I'm too much a Marvel fan to resist this one. 

There are a lot of wonderful little stats puzzles to solve during game play. If you like probability and odds you may really like this.  However studying the math may only give you a  10 or 20% lift (raising a 50% to a 70% for instance).  Player luck will therefore still play a huge part and there are many people who don't like that. Personally as long as I get the little puzzles to solve I don't mind their final outcomes still being near coin tosses. Also if you are the type of group that rotates from game to different game each session you may not get your full worth from this one -- it needs multiple playings to becomes quick and more enjoyable. 

Despite some imbalances, I find working out the odds on the dice to be fun, clever, and different (for me reminiscent of Titan or ButtonMen)

This game is full of skillful mitigation of card drawing, RPS strategy selection with player guessing, and die rolling luck that keeps you emotionally invested in your choices building up to the edge-of-your-seat final battle roll that really captures the thinking man's slug-a-thon that existed in the golden and silver age of Marvel Comics!  So much better than the plethora of games where your only choice is who to attack (then roll to hit and roll your damage. bleah!)

For me it's the best game Fantasy Flight has ever done.

Fans waited...and waited...and waited, and ended up with an obtuse superhero game designed by guys who's last names look like bad Scrabble hands. I guess it's considered to be "ameritrash," (the dice element?) but I think it's actually way more oddball than what most people would expect from a superhero game. Spend resources to move your team of heroes across New York in order to "troubleshoot" headlines that are popping up all over the city. Sounds simple enough, but something just seemed wrong about a game where you can just move anywhere you want without a dice roll (no suspense, I guess), and new players no doubt were left looking sadly at their stat cards realizing that "Level 3 - KO 3" just didn't inspire them to great acts of superheroism as much as something like "Hulk: Roll 200 dice. Kill anything." Search yourself, you know I'm right.

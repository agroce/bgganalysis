Unusual area control game where the board shrinks as you play, fairly random and chaotic, but plenty to think about. Your position can change pretty quickly if you don't watch out!

I think this is the coolest Colvini game I have played so far. Getting through the rules is tough, but the game itself is quite simple. I have only played two player so far, but have really enjoyed the elegance accentuated with a bit of chaos via the dice. I look forward to more plays of this one.

Played once so far. Has lots of potential. I'm normally not a huge fan of colovini. I find his games a little too dry (like many others, it seems). However, this one was pretty interesting. The balancing of the influence in your court vs. the board position made the choices interesting. It might be a little too luck dependent - we'll have to see with more playings. I have kept the lead in three colors, but two of them it was a very tenuous lead, and had someone rolled a little better they might have taken that lead away.

Two 3-player games so far.  Different than I thought it would be.  The rules make it sound like it will be some epic E&T battle arena of chain reactions.  In reality, you had the fortifying, and then one or two takeovers, and it was done!  Over in 30 minutes each time.  Am I wrong for wanting it to go on a little longer?

Seems like it would be different with 2 or 4 players.

Update: VERY different with 2 players.  Tense and much longer.

RATING: 7.5
A good game, initially quite mind-boggling as you try to compute all the factors and possibilities, but once all players reach a certain level of competency, it degenerates into something of a luck-fest as play drones on until someone gets a needed break.

Es un juego del que esperaba algo más, pero me ha dejado algo indiferente. Imagino que con algo más de experiencia el juego se disfrute de otra manera, pero me ha parecido demasiado abstracto, algo azaroso y quizá demasiado corto. Por otro lado, tusnos rápidos, algo de puteo y cierta estrategia a corto plazo.

RATING: 8.6
One of the better tactical games out there (although there is also an element of strategy, as one ponders where Charlemagne will move to, and what colours to focus on). 
A tad reminiscent of Signor Colovini's Masons, but FAR better. The theme, however, is equally thin.
Very simple rules, but just a little on the brain-burning side.

A game that has plummeted in my estimation with repeat plays.  Play is completely dominated by the dice rolls for cubes.  There are some interesting decisions around the choice of numbered discs, but that's about it really. A shame, the little islands and castles are quite pretty.

RATING: 8.5
Great 2-player game (haven't tried with 3 or 4). In pure Colovini style, the mechanics are very easy to grasp but there are always some interesting tactical choices to make in how to best exploit the cube colors that the dice give to you each turn. The pace of the game is brisk and down to the last round there can be some big surprises (yet never entirely out of the blue) in who is going to win.

A very nice game. It's very fast to learn, but it gives you very deep, thoughtful moments. The choices are few, but significant. Plus, there is some randomness so it doesn't turn into a dry brain-burner.

The only downfall is it only supports 2 or 3 players... the 4 player variant is not so good.

UPDATE: After several plays, I'm betting this one will remain a solid 7 for me.

Initial thoughts: A nicely balanced game with a modicom of luck but the majority of game play being down to strategy crunching. 

Have now played this quite a few times the game is now it seems more of a parade dependent upon the draw of the colours. There is little room for inspired skill as most wins are ground out from solid well rehersed strategies and good colour draws. Put another way, if the colours are against you, you will lose unless your opponant is a complete novice.

Reduced rating from 7.5 (what was I thinking?) to a generous 6 and game is up for trade.

Game has left the building, rating reduced to a 5.

It is a beautiful abstract hiding within a board game. Great original mechanics and wonderful bits. Oh how I love colored cubes. Why do you think that is? I think that while attempting to solve that darn Rubiks cube puzzle in our youth something about colored cubes was burned into our brains. Cubes are good. You can't get enough of the cubes. Where was I?

Reminds me of chess as there is lots of thinking and planning ahead.  Delicious balancing of turn order vs position with resource management thrown in.  Has dice but doesn't seem to greatly swing the game (generally - I've seen exceptions).  I think this is one of the very best 3 player games, along with San Marco.

Carolus Magnus is an abstract game with originality in its mechanics.  One of the few games I have ever played that scales well from 2 to 4. An excellent game of tough decision-making, and a strong design sense to pull together a rather abstract strategy concoction. While it may first appear "dry" I find the game rather lush and engaging.  There is a small luck factor in the game with dice.

A variant of the game is:  For more control a player rolls the dice at the beginning of his turn, even though he still can recruit only at the end of the turn. This way, a player always know what knights he may have for the next turn when deciding of his actions this turn.

RATING: 7
This is a good game that has a middle-weight heavy feel, but really, it's pretty quick and light. I like the balance of placing pieces in you court or on the board.  I like the battle for land, and the merging of adjacent conquered land.

The strategy may be pretty limited:  play control to your court in the beginning that matches the initial land setup, gobble up all the free land you can, and then go for that one double or tripple of your opponent's before she does the same to you. But, the game is quick. Two players who know what they're doing could crank out a game in under 30 minutes.

I think this game is really just a heavy filler, and from the view, I guess I like it.

One of Colovini's best!! This is my favorite abstract game for 3 players next to Hansa. The theme could be anything, but it is castle building in Charlemagne's empire. This makes for better bits compared to cake baking at Martha Stewart's house. The 2 player game is even better. Play this game for it's interesting mechanics, interplay, and stratigic depth not for it's thin theme.

Played with two.  What a great game.  The dice rolls can be a bit lucky, I guess, but the rest of the game is intense.  With two, you have room to plan and plot a couple of turns out but don't forget plans B, C, and D as your plan A might not be available.  Paying attention to your opponents cube reserve and order chips is a must.  

Update: pushed it up to an 8.5.  Love the game and would like to give it a spin as a three player game.

Jan 2018 - Played my 3rd game of 3 player.  Still at an 8.5.  I am a Colovini fan, I realized.  Simple play, lots going on, and you can play with lots of creativity.  Next, try the 4 player partnership game.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite abstracts.  Sure there's a lot of luck in the die rolls, but this is a fun game with a dynamic board (islands merging).  Can get a little brain intensive, but most of your choices are limited by the die rolls (i.e. tactical)... so turn length is typically not excessive.  I also enjoy the 4-player partnership game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interestingly different game. Taking control of a colour and placing towers on islands are two simple enough mechanics but couple that with the way that you can merge islands together and you have something that really makes you think. Merging islands changes the way the game plays as it shortens the "lap" that the pawn moves around.

Not a bad little medium game. Some intracacies. However, as the game progresses and the islands merge, there can be large swings with games turning on a dime. Also, it is a game that can be luck dependent with dice rolls. The components are of good quality and are fairly attractive.

This is a fairly quick game with some interesting decisions packed into a short time.  I do like it and it's almost a very good game but it's not quite there. The Faidutti variant helps (surprisingly, perhaps, by making it less chaotic!) but there's still a touch too much randomness really.

A game that was neat when it came out, and the short playing time, simple rules, and neat board-building mechanic got it a lot of play. Has not aged well, though, and it hasn&#039;t come off the shelf after the first 10 or so plays. 10 plays is pretty good, but probably not one to go back for.

Very exciting game with a lot of challenging and difficult decisions!  Should I play paladins to my court to strengthen control of a color, or play them out on the islands, where they help me for the short term, but could potentially work against me later?  Even playing numbers for movement of the king/turn order is sometimes a difficult decision!  An attractive game with very nice bits to boot.  Update: After many plays of this game, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and am always anxious to play again and again!

My rating is probably too generous considering how much I disliked this game... I can see the cleverness of the design in some aspects, but other aspects just feels way too random and straight up boring. This is an example of one of the older eurogames (i.e. not a lot of rules and points) done wrong... It felt uninspiring, boring theme, visually horrible to behold, too random (dice rolls, argh!)...
Almost all of Colovini's designs are quite frankly boring, and on top of that this one even had too much luck; if you don't roll enough of a certain color to overtake that color, it's hard to manipulate anything, i.e. if you roll one or two of each color and almost no wilds, you're unlikely to win. Bad game!

Love this game - it just makes sense to me. You can actually see 4-5 moves ahead and manipulate things to your advantage. Dice rolling randomness to get paladins forces recalculations of positions, I find it excrutiatingly fun.

I was a little intimidated by all the bits in this game before we got it, but I'm not sorry we did.  This is one of the most original and interesting games we have played.  Although there are alot of bits, most of them are of the same type.  These same bits have more than one use, which forces you to decide where they will be most valuable to you, both now and later in the game.  This game always keeps us on our toes, without being stressful to play.  It works very well for 2 players.  We played once with 3, and that seemed to work fine too.

RATING: 8
The selection of turn order numbers is highly tactical, reasonably calculable, and modestly interesting. So far, only played with the dice; looking forward to playing without. Overall, a neat and very fresh feel but perhaps not enough game there. Time will tell if it offers opportunities for more creative play.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy the two tiered stock/area control mechanism to gain control of a tile.  I also enjoy the shrinking play area mechanic which increases the tension towards the end of the game.

I think there are some interesting butterfly effects in this game that I still can't fully grasp.  This one is a little prone to group think, which means switching up your play style really freshens up the experience. 

We only play with the no-luck variant.  Place groups of paladins out to choose (n+1) and add a paladin to the unchosen lot at the end of each round.  This removes the luck of the dice and creates a perfect information game of brain-burny goodness. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quick to set up and tear down, simple to teach and with no exceptions, and gorgeous presentation. A brain-burner of an double area majority game, and an excellent abstract with just a bit of luck to keep things fresh. Elegant and unique. Need to try it once with teams. Keeper all the way.

RATING: 7
Playing this game was enjoyable. I like the mechanics. However, it gets knocked because of increasing ability to calculate forced moves ahead. At the endgame, it tends to bog down as players try to figure out what their opponents will do in 3 turns.  

However, it is nice that it works so well for 3.

RATING: 5
Fairly vanilla area influence game, but it has a couple of twists. The land masses growing together, the 'great connector' moving a number of steps equal to or less than your bid, and the variable colours of interest to each player all worked well for me. The thing I didn't like was the dice to restock your colours aspect, it handed me very nice things the entire course of the game, and was enough to shove things in my teams favour. I think the dice normally wouldn't be that big of a factor, but the fact that it can happen does take away from the game a bit for me. Essentially, ends up average because it does nothing spectacular in a very crowded niche (area influence games).

A bit awkward at first, but once you get a feel for the game it's great.  Layers of strategy can be thwarted by bad dice rolls, but that's part of the fun- adapting to your available resources.  Produces some awesome turnovers- don't think you've won the game until you've put down that 10th castle.  Awesome with 2 players.

RATING: 7
Only 1 play so far (unless I have since I last update this :-)), and that was with 4 players, using the 2v2 team variant. One thing we quickly realized (and it even mentions this in the rules) is that with this variant you really should disallow talking between partners, which we didn't try to enforce. In hindsight, I will enforce it next time. I need to try this again without the table talk, and also with 2 and 3 players. I don't have a good idea which way I'd prefer it. Some interesting things going on. But in our first game, it was pretty much everyone getting one castle each turn, which I think means we didn't block effectively. One team (mine), was able to capture exactly one castle, and that's what decided the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is one intruiging title. Players decide on turn order by playing a disc with a number between 1 and 5, but they are not allowed to pick a number already chosen by someone else, and do not get their discs back until all five have been played. Then they play a double majority game on a shrinking playing field. By increasing the influence over a particular colour, they eventually obtain a marker indicating they are the top dog in that colour, and as a result all influence in that colour on actual the playing area becomes theirs. Then when the king—Charles the Great—ends his turn on a province, it is established who has the most influence points lying there, and that player gets to place citadels. By having citadels on neighbouring provinces, you are obligated to consolidate provinces into larger and harder to subvert regions. However, owing to the capriciousness of the influence points, they can still be made to switch sides. The game ends when a player runs out of citadels. 

Really quite good stuff. For such a short game it packs a lot of gaming goodness in it. There is considerable jockeying for turn order in addition to having others make forced moves to retain a majority. And although there is no simple turn order (the players decide first how and when they want to play, but not [i]what[/i]) I find that in this form it is quite palatable. It is only when I also have to guess about what I am going to play when that I experience friction between my plans and the game (like in El Grande or Maharaja).

There seems to be one 'but' though: the dice. Replenishment of influence cubes is done through the throw of unmitigated dice, and that doesn't sit very well with a lot of people. I am not so sure, and given my living hatred for anything that unmitigated, that is saying something. Although a variant exists I'm not convinced it addresses a problem which needs to be solved. See, none of the dice rolls are [i]bad[/i]: each player gets exactly the same amount of influence cubes. Just the colour is different. I think the randomness introduced by the dice gives the game a certain and desirable amount of fluidity: I think Carolus Magnus does not really support lengthy strategic considerations, and so keeping the game a little lighter than it could be it perhaps not such a bad idea. The popular variant would, I think, tend to have players consolidate power in certain colours, locking up the game more than the variant intends to solve. In this case a little randomness is actually a Good Thing™.

In any case, a beautiful game, and probably one of Leo Colovini's best. It's too bad it's OOP these days: it deserves widespread recognition.

I [i]really[/i] enjoy this one, but the complaints about the endgame are totally on the mark.

Played once with 2p.  Interesting mechanics.  There is some randomness with the dice rolls, but it is outweighed by the strategic decisions needed.  It's a fast game.  UPDATE - Played again with 3p.  Not sure if i like it with three.  It was more unpredictable.  At one point, I was two towers away from winning.  A few turns later, the game was over and I had no towers on the board.  But still an interesting game.  I'd like to try the "no dice" variant next time.

Components: Tons of wooden bits. I like how the territories slide together in abstract maps, and how easily distinguishable the castles are from the paladins.

Experience: Very aggressive. I enjoy merging the territories. I also enjoy the brain battle of looking over at my opponent's reserve, and my own, and trying to calculate what might happen. But I think it's too confrontational for my taste.

The game box contains fine components and a rulebook of no more than 4 pages, yet it is quite big for the small inventory it has. The rules concern 2, 3 and 4-player game mechanics. They are easy to learn and one test round is enough to get the feeling of it. There is no board just territory tiles  spread out in a circle. Each player has a Court and a number of cubes of different colors representing his paladins. On each turn players decide whether their paladins are going to be placed on the territory tiles or their Court and move around the tiles a wooden piece- the Emperor. The more paladins a player has in his Court or on a territory give him the advantage. When the Emperor lands in such a tile the respective player can build a castle. Adjacent tiles belonging to the same player can be combined and form a region. The player who has managed to build all his castles at his disposal is the winner. It has a luck factor but one faces tough decisions on his turn regarding placement of his paladins. The game is simple and fast but none can foresee the winner because of the unexpected turnovers. Interesting concept but after a few plays the game becomes repetitive and bland.

RATING: 2
Played 3 player. Choosing discs for turn order either felt chaotic if you weren't willing to permute, or tedious if you were. The dice would seem to add a pleasant information horizon to limit thinking ahead, but because they happen at the end of your turn, they contributed to a feeling of either frustration or obviousness at the beginning of your next turn.

For several turns in a row, I couldn't change the game in a way favorable to me, while others could, taking obvious advantages available to them. Then, when I built up the right majorities in my court, I forced other players to feel frustrated when they could do nothing to counter my advances.

It feels unengaging to be stuck, waiting for an opportunity to advance, and unpleasant to feel others' frustration when you can advance only because there's nothing they can do to stop you. It's undramatic. Where's the risk-taking? Where's the suspense?

I had high hopes after all the good reviews, but this game is definitely not my cup of tea. The chess-like permutation, the randomness being used to limit player interaction, and the lack of tactical and endgame tension are all deal killers. Considering my similar disappointment with Clans, I will be hesitant to play other Colovini games.

This was randomly pulled our recently and I forgot how much I enjoyed this game when it first came out.  It was one of my favorites of 2000, but got lost in the fog of titles that have come out since then.

It seems to have just the right level of decision making and analysis without becoming a brain burner.  The order of play is the key to the game and so trying to sort out and then antcipate how others will play their turn order chits is rather satisfying.  What pulls it together is the rather unique territorial merger mechanism, which makes the game continue to grow in tension as play progresses, and likewise allows for some sneaky sudden reversals.

Great game, but having the dice determine which paladins you get every turn often makes it impossible to pursue a directed strategy.  The chance element is still needed to keep the game balanced, but we toned it down a bit by having players roll one less die, replacing the missing die with a free choice (as if it were an automatic crown)

UPDATE: I got a copy in a Christmas white elephant exchange sort of thing, so I guess I'll be giving this one another whirl sooner or later.

An interesting area control game where the areas being controlled start joining so the areas get fewer, but larger (yeah that was poorly worded, but I trust you to figure it out).

I played it again with three and I'm not sure I like the second part of the game, in which the flow of the game grinds to a halt. Traded.

TIP: If you want to pick up this one cheap, start searching ebay auctions for "carolvs magnvs," like it says on the box.

In El Grande and some other Area Control games you try to control a region which will give you points.  In this game you are vying for control over 5 factions.  If you control a faction and if you have a majority in an area, you may play a castle which helps you maintain control over the area and gets you closer to winning.  You have to play all of your castles to win.  You can add faction cubes to help you take control of regions but if you lose control of the faction, those cubes can then be used against you.  It's interesting but I don't like that there is luck, in the form of dice, which can determine what faction you have the best chance at exerting influence.  I feel it should be a choice.  This game is supposed to be best with three and has team play with 4 players.

Very interesting and pretty abstract area influence game. The king moves around the circle of territories under player control. Each place he visits gets resolved. The winner places a tower and merges the territory with any neighboring territories with their towers. Very tense, but a bit chaotic at the end.

Tenative rating after 1 play w/ 3. I like this game quite a bit. While the dice do keep this game from being terribly strategic, they do keep it light and engaging. El Grande light - almost. As I LOVE El Grande, this was fun. I am curious as to how well it plays with 4 though.

I really enjoyed it both times. I think it's quick and easy to learn and for some reason, I think I like it more than anyone else. There seems to be an issue where the final play can sneak up on you, so pay attention to the lay of things. The end of the game might not be far off.

RATING: 3
(2-4 players) What is the point of this game if all you can really do is invest cubes in your court?  And even then you are stuck investing in what you get from dice rolls. Barring some modification that encourages a balance of play between the courts and territories I won't be trying this again, which is too bad because the idea shows so much promise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game, the balance lies between occupying zones or building your majorities. Let the other dummies flood the field, you can usurp them by filling your scorecard. Nice. *** Played again with 3 players. Bit of stalemate, lots of struggle to control the families, not to play into the regions. We ran out of yellow, but I had mine in reserve. What to do? When you capture a region, do you put in 1 castle, or do you put in as many castles as you threw out?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting area control game where nearby territories can merge together.  When this happens things start to get more exciting.  Be careful though, as your hard work can suddenly get stolen if you are not protected.  I like the turn order & emperor movement, but the end game can drag on a bit.  Feels a little dry.  Grade: B-

Played 2 times. Once 2p, once 3p. Interesting and unique game, but still very abstract. Very good for what it is. Quick too. // I played again recently and forgot how much luck there can be in the endgame, but somehow, the endgame wraps up quickly making for a fast tense finish. The end color rolls inject luck into the game as massive swings can occur, but for some reason it doesn't bother me as much as I though it should. One of the best abstract games I have ever played.

AUG/13: Ratings drift. As I get more interest in theme, games like Carolus pale.

The game of clumping territories.  Watch out for the color control as wild unexpected switches are commonplace.  While I dislike too much randomness, there is sufficient control in this one to make for a challenging game.  Plays very well in teams of 2 vs 2.

If I didn't have four kids and a dog this is the euro  board game I would leave set up on a coffee table for visitors to see.  It's just beautiful to look at and  a perfect combination of theme, artwork and mechanics.  The only drawback to this game for me is the limited number of players- which makes it hard to play very often.  I love the artwork on the tiles, the messy mountain of cubes in the middle of the playing area and the way the emperor orbits around the board in clockwise fashion.  It's really cool when the tiles merge to make larger kingdoms.  I'm not really into abstracts but this game fits it's theme to perfection and feels great to me.

Rating is for the 2 player game, without any variant. I have still to try any other configuration, but as it is it feels like a very good read-ahead game. Nothing to do with usual chaos-filled majority games. This one has more to do with chess than with El Grande. Randomness of dice roll seems like it could tip the game, since often much is hanging on simple majorities.

I have played this game about three times. It has nice components and at the beginning its quite interesting. The mechanics have also felt fresh. However, according to my experience, at about half-time it becomes clear who will win the game. Afterwards the remainder is a victory march for the winner while the others are only assisting. I rarely get as frustrated when I play board games as I have gotten while powerlessly watching that avalanche effect

First off, beautiful presentation! From the unique wooden pieces to the layout of the territory board, this game screams different. The game does boil down to an area control game, but there is a lot of puzzly-ness going on that makes it a real brain-burner. This is good as a short game because of the repetitive nature of gameplay, but the way the game evolves into further scrutiny and tug-of-war tactics keeps the brain stewing the whole time. Ultimately, this is nothing innovative - but what it does with area control and aesthetics is super solid. I rate it a very high 7.

Yes, another Colovini title I thoroughly enjoy.  I am amazed by Colovini's ability to keep creating such unique titles that although are abstract at heart never are absent of soul.  Carolus Magnus, although the predecessor of Masons, feels like the more highly evolved sibling - as they share similar feeling mechanics but Carolus' exhibit themselves with more confidence.  The ability to team up is an interesting and welcome addition to Magnus which adds a wealth of replability for me.  Brilliant!!

UPDATE:  After more plays of both this and Masons, I will have to retract my comments about this being the better of the two.  Both play very differently and the comparisons I made were slightly premature, as the components and the dice rolling deceived me into a quick adjoining of the two games.  With this said however, I still like both games a lot, but Masons seems the more superior design for me.

Highly addictive and super replay value. A game with a difference.

Chaos. Interesting in how one must balance the luck of their draw with Paladins and how to place them- either in their court to hold majority, or on areas for influence. Pretty pleasant game, though very abstract. It's simple to learn and can be taught to beginners. Your strategy is pretty much totally dependent upon what colors you roll, and that can change drastically from turn to turn. You'll get screwed several times over because of not rolling what you planned for. It can be frustrating. Not worth keeping.

The decisions in this game are absolutely beautiful, you can get really creative with your moves in this one. There is a fair bit of luck, and at times that may override all of your brilliant moves, but who cares? It's a game about maximizing your position with what you have, and there are plenty of avenues to take in getting this done. I really love the strategy in this one, all I can say is it's beautiful, and coming up with each move to fit the game at play is very rewarding. One of my favorite 3 player games, good with 2 as well. (have not played with 4)

Had this on my want list forever and am glad, that I finally decided to pick it up. I've only played it as a two player game, but wow what a great game it was. Very easy to play/teach and has a good amount of depth to it. The game pieces look nice and are well made and there is a LOT of wooden pieces in this game. Heck, my copy even came with 20 extras, which was really nice.

This was an excellent two player game. I'd definitely recommend checking this one out. It was a lot easier to play, than I expected.

An excellent area control mixed with majority control of ownership of units used to control the areas. The 4 player partnership game is fantastic.

Dice a bit too random in a game that is this short. Very fun!

Great game. Simple components, simple rules, many overlapping strategies. The constant battle to control the right colors of paladins, while your future turn options continuously shrink is amazing.

I haven't liked Colovini so far, so this surprised me. Despite my own misplay (placing knights on the board seems self-destructive early on), the injection of uncontrollable luck at the very beginning of a series of full-information decisions gave this a texture I kind of like. Right down to the odd step of having "wild" cubes that you choose the color of [b]when you draw them[/b], not when you play them.

This is a fun little abstract game.  I like the look and play, but have a little trouble with the theme (islands don't move, bridges anyone?)  It plays quickly and has depth even though the rules are not extensive.  It is also a good 2 player game, and worth an extra point in my rating for that reason (3 or four player I would rate a 6).

The downside is that there are a lot of "bits", and setup can take a little while.  Also, there is ample opportunity to have things knocked over.  The luck factor (and there is a lot of luck) can make your dominance change quicker than you could imagine.

Played the 4-player team version of the game. It's neat, but the last few turns near the end when I was pretty sure I was losing, wasn't sure I could turn it around.

I was playing with people who have played the game a lot, so it could be some strategy insight I hadn't picked up on. I'd play it some more.

Unusual in being best for 3 players and partnerships with 4. Lighter and more approachable than most brainburners, but like many other games the randomness of the cube refresh can severely limit your options.

Played with two.  Found this very weird. It's a kind of area control game, but one where the number of areas to control gets smaller and smaller, until it comes down to a battle over the final few that are left.  It seemed pretty neat until we realized that we were going back and forth in a seemingly endless way and that neither of us was going to be able to win anytime soon, at which point we abandoned the game. Maybe it's better with three? (1 play)

Really an abstract strategy game at heart.  Ironically, the "random" element of the game - rolling dice to replenish your paladin reserve - adds a bit more luck to this game than you may expect to find in the "abstract" category, but it's one of the items you need to manage in the game to be successful.

I've played with 2 teams of 2, which works well.  I've played 3, which I had hoped would be a great number for this game, but found the roll of the dice can really make or break you.

Happy to see this added to www.yucata.de.

UPDATE: I really wanted to like this game and had huge hopes that it would really work well.  Unfortunately, I've found the game to be very conflicted - it's a deep thinking game, in that you have to plan one or two turns ahead with regard to turn order and what colors you can control at what time.  Sadly, the random element in the game (i.e., acquisition of paladin reserves via dice rolls) can completely torpedo any deep thinking that you do.  e.g., I set up to make a run at controlling green, but then I roll and get no new greens into my supply and I'm back to square 1 (while my opponents may have been much more fortunate).

Normally, I love Colovini designs that take abstract strategy concepts and give them an asymmetric or random twist that you have to manage.  In this game, the randomizing twist just seems to undermine, not complement, the game as a whole.  Overall, just not my favorite Colovini design.

Based on the area control mechanics, Carolus Magnus takes advantage of dice rolling and modular board. All of these elements are nicely merged together. One of the best words to summarize the game Carolus Magnus is ever-changing area control game. According to the arrangement of mercenaries on the modular board, the aspect of game is dramatically changed from the beginning to the end. Carolus Magnus offers a lot of fun with the simple rules. It is a nice introduction game to the area control mechanic. However, the game is pretty much influenced by dice luck. Because of the factor of fortune, the game is easy to be tired of.

After 1 2-player game.  Initial rating (there's a room for 1 point improvement).

This is an original game, but just doesn't appeal to me.  Yet *another* game from Colovini, which I'm not fan of.

[Randomness can be too much of a factor here, but it's possible to verify it only after a few games]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
initial rating 2 plays 2 players

Both our games with 2 players went down to a stalemate situation near the end which totally ruined the game for me.

The beginning is more like a prolonged set-up really with your play almost predetermined and obvious, the mid-game was very good and quite interesting with some nice mechanics like merging provinces and teritorial fights but then the endgame seems to ruin it for me, very anticlimactic where you are waiting for the right dice roll to determine the winner. Maybe some tweaks can improve this I'm not sure yet.  Colovoni's Clans seems to have the same attributes including a great mid game and an unpolished ending. 

I wonder if the ending can be houseruled and the non-dice rolling variant posted looks like it should work decent too.  Looking forward to trying these things, 3 players and 2 teams with hopefully better results

This is one of the most original and interesting games we have played. One of the best influence games I've played. Probably my favorite 3-player game (together with San Marco). The dice add a substantial element of randomness, but a good player will always be able to adapt his/her strategy so as to make the most out of it, even if it means having to completely change plans. Highly addictive and super replay value. A great game with a difference.

Played two two-player games so far, but enjoyed it. It plays quick, but doesn't feel like a "light" game since there are enough interesting decisions to make on each turn. The randomness of the dice felt a little constraining, but I've read about a variant here on BoardGameGeek that lets each player re-roll 1 to 3 dice each turn if they don't like what they rolled. I might give that a try if I feel like the dice end up being too frustrating.

Played a three-player game and fell pretty far behind and felt like I had no hope of winning. I was eventually able to pull off a move that reduces swapped positions (in a big way) for me (who was far behind in last place) and the person in first place. The rules actually warned about watching for that kind of thing, but it felt weird how the game could change so drastically with one move.

I've played this twice - once with four players (teams of 2) and once with 3.  The first game went very well.  The rules were a little difficult to interpret at first, but made more sense as we played.  The 3-player game might have suffered from a bit too much luck.  I'll need repeated playings to see if luck is always that big a part of the game.  I like a bit of luck thrown in, as long as a dice roll isn't going to determine the outcome.  I'm pleased with this one so far.

Update:  dropped this significantly.  Haven't played this in years, and don't have much desire to.

I need to play this again face to face to see if I overrated it, I have been playing this online on Yucata but it is not as fun. At first I really liked the game but now I’m not so sure (thus the 6.5 rating). I still think it is a good game but I´m bothered by the amount of luck the game has. For a while there, I have been thinking that the player who rolled better dice is the winner. If that is the case the game would drop even further in my rankings. Best if played by 3 although I would love to try the 4 player variant.

I played the game face to face a long time now and I played it as a 4 player game yesterday. A long time ago, I really liked it, but I have changed a lot during these passing years. Now I prefer heavy Euros and, in general, I don´t like most (if any) Leo Colovini´s designs.

There is a lot of luck with the dice, the decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard. I think it is best played as a two player game although the 4 player game in very interesting if players are to allowed to talk about the game. Each partner need to analyze the game situation by himself. If players are allowed to talk, it is very easy to execute the best play.

The theme is ok, but you don´t feel it through the game. The game´s components are ok.

Bottom line, I will sell my copy of the game ASAP, Carolus Magnus isn’t a bad game, but it isn’t a game for me. The luck factor is very high. It is one of the best Leo Colovini´s designs, but that’s not saying much.

The rules are simple and the game mechanics are very elegant.  The gameplay rewards careful planning and the ability to see a few moves ahead.  I think that this game design is one of the best implementations of the combination of strategy and luck that is out there.  Sometimes you encounter an endgame situation where the winner is the first to get the majority in a particular color and thus, it simply comes down to dice rolls.  However, I find the gameplay experience so rich and satisfying that it really doesn't bother me that much.

If you like lightly themed abstracts like King of Siam and Medina, then this game is for you. Those are two of my favorite games, and I was immediately enraptured by this one. Very spatial game involving "investing" in colors to compete for control of islands that can then merge together. Another twist on this one is that it has a bit of luck in the form of dice. I suppose you could do a diceless variant for those who prefer no-luck games, I think it would still hold up well.
Played it 2-player, I think it would be even more interesting with 3. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game of area control. Felt like an arms race between the color cubes. I thought it was surprisingly thematic given the abstract nature of the game mechanics. 

The dice add a significant amount of randomness. In fact, I might even venture to suggest that the dice make the game overly chaotic, since color control is vital to placing castles. The third player adds kingmaking to the mix as well. The turn order chips, the placing of cubes on territories, and the Emperor movement, help to mitigate this to some extent.

Overall, I like the interplay and want to play it again.

My first impression of this game after two online plays is not too favourable. I'm starting to see why many gamers consider Colovini's games as dry. Looking at rank and rating, this is considered his best effort so far by BGG which I can not confirm. While my esteem of Colovini's games is decreasing the more games I play, I still like Bridges of Shangri-la, Clans, Mauerbauer and Cartagena better. It tops Familienbande though which I don't like at all.

After 2 plays, I haven't a clue how to win this one - and really that's a good thing - one of the nicest things about boardgaming is getting your head around a new game, trying things out, etc. The only galling thing is that I was soundly trounced by my 12yo son in both plays, and I don't even know how he did it!

RATING: 7
For me personally, the game is pretty brain-burning.  I would definitely refrain from playing this with AP-types, as I can see this really bogging down with serious downtime issues as players calculate what the optimum move would be.  I don't find that the dice negatively affect the game - I actually enjoy the random element it provides, as the game would be too serious and calculating if it was luckless.  The "theme" is almost laughable, it's funny reading the rules - who actually calls the cubes "paladins"?  But the pieces are nice and the gameplay is very intriguing.  It seems that there can be huge swings of fortune during the course of each game.  I'd like to give this a few more tries to solidify my opinion.

A very abstractly presented area majority game. Players compete for ownership of the cubes that mostly decide the majorities. Controlling areas allows the placement of personal pieces which effectively act as victory points but are not guaranteed to remain on the board. Seems it is in fact better with three. I had thought the balance between securing cube ownership and placing cubes would shift noticeably, but that particular aspect actually wasn't much different. There is a possibility of an interminable endgame with long analyses of how to stop this or that player from winning, but there is also some inertia in the turn order system to overcome this; it may not be a good idea to remove the randomness of the dice rolls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Not a bad game... there might be a tad bit too much of a pendulum effect at the end of the game when trying to determine the winner, possibly some King-making as well... possibly a bit broken? Initial rating 6. Edit: Feb 5/17. It's been many years since playing this and with all the good games to come out since, I doubt I will ever play it again. Even looking at the pictures it seems like a rather forgettable game. Rerated to a 4.5

[LUP 17-Apr-2007] Gregor taught this.  Have only played the once so far.  Somewhat abstract and it is very important in the end game to be thinking quite a few turns ahead for both yourself and impacts of, or to, other players.  It feels like a game I would need to play a few times to get the hang of, and would become much more appealing once you knew what you doing.

2014.04.21 It's enjoyable and there's a lot of room for strategy and plotting. There's a definite social reading / theory of mind aspect involved in the selecting of the number discs at the beginning of a round. The turns move quickly: all you do is place three cubes and move the emperor token. But within that quick turn, you've got a great deal of swaying power. The area control battles feel [thing=42][/thing]-y, only more streamlined. The pacing feels right in that the game speeds up when things start getting dicey: since the 15 territories merge, near the end of the game you might have only 5 territories, meaning the emperor moves around them much more speedily. Really fun. (Based on a two-player session.)

2014.05.03 Upping the rating. This is the [thing=9209][/thing] of area control games.

Is a solid area majority partnership game with four players. I don't think it will be good with two. And just okay with three. I have no intentions of playing it with those numbers.

The rules aren't too hard allthough one of us had problems with what team majority meant in the court.  The player who has the piece indicating the majority of cubes in a certain row has the majority in that colour. Meaning his team will score points for every cube in that colour in the provences.

What is not to love in this one? I love how Colovini takes very simple ideas and turns them into torture. Everytime I play this one it seems there is always a point where I shout "I love this game!" I have had thirty minute conversations on the strategy in use of particular numbers for this game. "3" is by far and away the most interesting.

Decent fairly abstract game in which one manages leadership in the court vs. leadership on the board.  I have only played online at Yucata so my rating should be seen as provisional until I manage to get in a play face to face.

2-4 players.  Always enjoy this game.  Particularly good with 3 players.  I love the luck added by the dice rolls for replenishing your cubes, even though it can definitely make or break your game position.  Great components in this one.

This game can tend to make your head hurt.  But the concept of it is great.  It truly tests your ability to balance the "supplies" of paladdins to both the territories and within the courts.  As well as keeping you on your toes on how can you capture as much territory to meld them together as quickly as possible.  Then suddenly.... WHAT!?!? I'm not in charge of green, dang it!

The only really frustrating part about the game is the die rolls for the colored paladdins.  If you don't like randomly rolling for your supply then I should suggest staying away.  Unless you're one of those great rollers, ;-)

I think there are some interesting things going on here like the islands that can be combined or how the "owner" of a color changes frequently. Unfortunately these interesting aspects are drawn out [i]ad nauseum[/i] by victory conditions that suck much of the fun right out of this game. Even when the victory conditions were described, I thought they would be difficult to complete. I wasn't disappointed.

In short, much too long for what it is.

Have played with 2,3 and 4. With teams (4 player) its a bit tricky taking turn order - good die rolls will destroy the otherside - and bad ones - well they're bad...

Game is nasty and one must always be on the lookout for that  group of tiles that can switch to your side.

Self limiting in time commitment so its easy to get out.

RATING: 7
A nice area control game where the 'board' is shrinking throughout the game. The bidding is actually quite important, as it determines both turn order and how far you can move the king to score a region. Rules are really quite simple, while implications and tactics take longer to master.

RATING: 5
Not overly interesting. Choices are limited and success depends mainly on rolling the right color at the right time on the dice. At least it is not too short and some decisions can be made

Very good abstract - especially notable because it works well with two, three or four players. With three players, it's an extremely intense and well-balanced juggle of offense and defense. With four, it is one of the best team games I know.

This is, by far, my most favorite 3-player game.

The game is easy to teach. The game provides lots of turn angst deciding how to bid for turn order, where to place your cubes, and how far to move the king.

There is great player interaction by attacking and defending your collapsed territories and the random element of the die roll adds a little spice to dealing with uncertainty.  

The partner-based four player game is also great for parents to pair with kids in family 'grudge-match' games :-)

If you have a chance to pick up this game...get it. You won't regret it.

Update: Lowered my rating to an 8, having played it 17 times in 2001-2013. Still haven´t tried it with 4, but I prefer 3 over 2. The randomness of the dice can be very frustrating, but that very same randomness saves the game from becoming an AP-inducing open info game. I like it.

Abstract, but I don't think the theme is entirely pasted on. Noble families did switch sides dramatically during political struggles in the period and in theory at least the construction of castles was forbidden unless one first obtained an imperial privilege. Both of these historical realities are simulated, albeit abstractly, by the game mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful, quick, and fun.  I find the 2-player game goes a bit too quickly w/little need for interaction in order to win.  
End game arrives quickly and often out of nowhere, which is a bit troubling and gives the impression of a loss of control.  However, it remains a personal favorite.

"Stupid random game with dice" but ... surprisingly it provides pretty fine emotions and is full of cute mechanics and elements.

2 partidas y media (no pudimos terminar la 3ª). A 2 y 3 jugadores. Un muy buen juego. Sencillo de explicar y corto de jugar (al menos de momento) pero con mucha miga. Encima con el precio que tiene... lo único malo el tamaño excesivo de la caja. Creo para 2 jugadores es de lo mejorcito que tengo hasta el momento.
Tras la primera partida a 4 me sigue pareciendo un gran juego para 2-4 jugadores. Aunque al menos en esta partida a 4 hemos llegado a un punto de estasis donde los dados han sido un poco determinantes. La duración es mucho mayor a 4 que a menos jugadores

3 player is definately the way to play this, i really like the way the number choosing works - similar to el caballero but it also affects the number choosing for the next round making the game completly circular and forcing some of the most agonizing decisions ive ever had to make!
2 and 4 player games are good but nowhere near as tense as the 3 player game

After first 3 plays: Nice game mechanism, feels different.

For now the luck of the dice seems to be too big, so next time I'll try the variant posted here.

A fun, light-strategy "war" game that plays very well with three players.  I'm looking forward to more plays.  You should use the choose-your-four-paladins variant, as it works really well, and adds much more strategy to the game.  Otherwise, I can see how it could be a lot more random, and perhaps frustrating to get plan going.  Good production values and simple rules.  Overall, a great game with a lite "war" flavor.

I really enjoyed the game that I played, although I can see how the game could easily end in a stalemate/whoever rolls the right dice wins. While playing, all my choices felt meaningful, but after analyzing the game afterwards I realized that they probably weren't. Really like the way turn order gets determined, adds a lot of tension/strategy.

RATING: 7
A tactical majorities game where dice can often play a great deal in determining your moves.  There are some significant decisions to make in placing cubes onto the board (strengthening a position in a tactic that can backfire later if you lose control of that area) or onto the table to increase your strength in a colour (let's just call them colours and cubes... why pretend there's theme in a Colvini game).   Plays quickly and probably best for with 3.  NOTE TO SELF: don't play this when I'm really tired!

Good game that scales well. However, it's definitely a different game with two, three or four. Two players emphasizes the dice luck factor, three players is more chaotic and longer but still fun and four players is played in two player teams, making it quite different. I think I like it more than most people, or at least few are interested to play it with me...

Indifferent.

Carolus Magnus is indeed El Grande minimized to perfection! The decisions are few but each one is critical for success. Do you choose a low turn order to move the Emperor first or a high turn order for a more flexible movement? Do you strengthen your majority in one color or challenge another player's majority? And when is the right time to start fighting for majority in the provinces? A game of Carolus Magnus starts deceivingly quiet and suddenly erupts into a fierce fight and timing is a key to success. This is lot of strategy packed into a quick and simple game.

Update(12/06/2008 ) : Now I like this game slightly less. The end game can easily lock up between capable players, and unfortunate dice rolls do not help as well. It's not that I don't like this anymore, but slightly less. Every time I play this game, I start the game thinking "this is a great mechanism!", but around the end game I always get the anti-climax feeling..

========================

Gorgeous bits, one of the best 3 players game. 

My only complaint is that the endgame feels a bit over-analytical, or even mechanical to some extent. In the beginning you feel like you're building up your territories slow and nicely. But somewhere along the way, the pendulum will swing, often without anyone noticing it. And by the time someone has noticed the swing, it's usually too late and there is nothing that one can do about it.

But I still like this game, and I think this is one of Colovini's greatest works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Simple rules, yet it's difficult to wrap you head around this one... It's area control with less control than usual, meaning you have to spend every cube wisely and be flexible in your planning. It also requires you to always be aware of the ever-changing game state, including other players' supplies, remaining turn order makers, and the possible positions of the king. Total control might be an illusion to some extent here, but bad play is definitely possible. It plays very differently with 2, 3, or 4 (which makes it a team game), but is good at all counts. I could take or leave the variants to mitigate the dice luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have only played the 2-player version, and could see this climbing to an 8 or 9 if the 3-player and 4-player partnership games play out as nicely. Reminds me of El Grande in a lot of ways (which is always a good thing in my book) without feeling like a clone or a ripoff, and plays very quickly. One obvious strategy is to try and control adjacent provinces as quickly as possible as it's very hard to overcome the added force which the castles contribute. I also like how you can force your opponent to do something he doesn't want to do by clever playing of your initiative markers.

RATING: 9
My idea of an elegant game: Rules that are quickly explained but give rise to an interesting and challenging gameplay. It is not too long but has a continuously rising tension as players battle over areas and house majorities. Luck is less of a factor than many people believe while managing the turn order correctly and being selective in placing knights in the areas is crucial. Highly recommended with 2 and 4 players; a little bit less enthusiastic about the 3-players variant as unlucky dice rolls can play a much bigger factor then.

Most two player Euros have a "small game feel" which always leaves me a bit lacking.  They feel like you are only getting to play part of a game, or are in some other way lacking the grandeur of a larger game.  Carolus Magnus breaks this mold.  It has brought a "big game feel" to a two player game and has a satisfying richness and depth that doesn't leave me craving a four player game immediately afterward.
...and the fact that it is simply gorgeous doesn't hurt!

RATING: 5
First impression: It's a very abstract game. Yes there is "theme" but it is a paper-thin. I played with 3 players and it feels a better choice than two or 4 (with teams). Playing was an ok experience since decisions are mostly interesting and need a though. On the other hand you cannot make strategic choices because you don't know what troops you can affect on your next turn. I felt dices controlled my game more than I wanted. Something else that bothered me was the fact that you aren't building good positions as much as you're trying to avoid serious mistake that'll destroy your game.

RATING: 7
Tight, lively tactical game in which players dominate and eventually merge provinces by obtaining majorities when the king is over there. While this is borrowed from El Grande (as well as auctioning for order of play or movement reach), there's a double bubble with the majorities, since the players control the colours of the cubes on the board by majorities as well. For this Carolus Magnus has got a new, entirely different character - lighter, shorter, less deep but more flexible and at the same time with less of a learning curve. 

Carolus Magnus works best as a partnership game - the game for three still works since you can reduce damages making your opponents draw on a territory you can't reach, but the game for two is a bit too luck-dependent.

Il miglior Colovini che conosca ed uno dei pochi giochi che a mio avviso da il meglio se giocato in 3. Tra le originalità la mancanza di un tabellone sostituito da pezzi irregolari (i territori da conquistare) che si comporranno tra loro durante lo svilupparsi della partita. Il gioco ha una forte interazione e può essere giocato anche in 2 giocatori (non male) o in 4 (in questo caso a coppie). Sul sito Tana dei Goblin presente la Variante per eliminare il lancio dei dadi! Gioco strategico, riuscito dalla durata contenuta.

RATING: 5.5
Not the great 3-player solution that we hoped it would be. Too easy to leave one player with an insoluble dilemma, and there are games that scratch the 3-player itch much more effectively (Caylus and Goa springing readily to mind). Regardless of the player number, this is an almighty head-hurter of a game, which will either attract a small band of devotees or put people off gaming for good. The random element of the dice is a real spoiler, though. I think I want to like it, but the jury's out. For now.

RATING: 6
Great little gem from Colovini. The bidding mechanic is cool since it controls player order, but also limits movement.

Carolus Maguns gets a lot of praise because for an area mjority game, it has a pretty unique feel. If you are the typical BGG game player, you will play it a few times, and say "Wow, that's pretty neat." It does have a nice feel, and there is definitely much more player interaction and screwage potential.

However, Carolus Magnus does not benefit from intense scrutiny. The game is fun the first few plays when you don't have a firm grasp of the strategic implications of moves. Once you understand the game, the dominant strategy emerges and the game becomes stale. Against a similarly competent opponent, the game is decided by the availability of cubes delivered by the dice. Go a couple turns with bad roles and you lose the game. Hence the numerous "fixes" people have employed to reduce the element of luck, in what would otherwise be a fine strategy game.

Okay area control game with a bit of randomness.  I played this with three, which felt really tense.  The game does provide some interesting decisions in both order selection and block moving/placement.  You have to keep attacks balanced, otherwise game will spiral out of control.  You can definitely get screwed by the dice here by getting an equal number of everything.  The game seems like it was meant to be played with two players, and I would really like to try it with two at some point.

It's about getting lucky with collecting cubes, but there comes a point where the delicious decision making comes along about when to sacrifice cubes to the board (playing offence vs defense). Added to that the care that must be taken with lookahead, and it's a strong package, though abstract.

The 2 player is a good challenge, and the 4 player partnership adds more timing interest, but I definitely prefer the 3 player with the longer mid-game and complexity of guarding against 2 other players intentions.

An abstract game that I surprisingly had never heard of before. This is a great abstract game where you move a king around the board and claim majority in each region by placing cubes of the colors you control. The thing is control of each color can change often as does turn order, so the mechanics are simple, but there is a lot to think about each turn.

Forget the attempt at theme, this is really a thinky abstract.  The region control mechanism was pretty neat, as every turn you were faced with the decision to strengthen your hold in certain colors, or to put those colored cubes on the board so that they actually did something.  Very tactical.  The reason for my low rating, however, was the end-game: I played a 2-player game that stalemated so badly at the end that we eventually just decided to call it a draw.  Neither player could take over any regions at the end, so the only valid move was to make sure the other player couldn't either.  My rating may improve if this doesn't happen frequently.

Played mostly with 2 players and the general consensus seems to be that 3 player is the way to play it, so the rating can still go up. With 2 players this is a very good game that impressed me a lot! The rules are very simple and easy to explain. So easy in fact that we were playing without any errors 10 minutes after reading them for the first time. The gameplay on the other hand is amazing! The merging of the regions is pure genius! It plays quickly but it IS a real brain burner! I like the dice to replenish your court and had no problem with them at all. However, if I feel that they are in fact a problem, there are several easy variants already suggested.With 3 players, the game seems to loose some of the predictability that allows for some planning ahead. But I'm not a very good player and only played it 3p once, so it's possible that my own limitations are preventing me from planning ahead and not the game. Have to played more with 3p to know for sure.

2 plays in, not sure about this one yet - there's a point at which the direct in-your-faceness combines with the random die rolls to be simply infuriating. Add to this that the 2P game can pretty easily wind up in a stalemate w/ both players holding 2 large kingdoms and almost equal influence in the clans, and the game goes from frustrating to boring quickly. That said, I really like how the turn order token mechanic introduces an "If I do this, then she could..." game theoretic analysis - I think this would work even better if there was a little bit less chaos in cube availability. 

2013-07-09: Played over the weekend with 3. Much better than with two.

Carolus Magnus - PWNED! Will play some and see how she fares.

Played an inagural game - 2 players.  Quite the brain-burner!  I was a bit disappointed to realize that this game really is dependant on the die roll.. but then again, I've only played 1 game.  As long as players aren't extremely unlucky with the dice, this one ought to be a good one.

Played a second game, but I won't rate it.  I happen to like it, although it is really teetering on the 'too abstract' side of gaming for my likes.  In fact, it's abstract as heck, but .. the pieces have little maps on them giving you a taste of theme... a theme-glaze.

Finally - I admit, this game has grown on me.  However, 3 players is much preferred.  Carolus is very abstract, but quite fun to play really.  The first half of the game becomes a power struggle and minor acquisition, while the second half lends itself to more conflict, once having established control of the colours of the court.  Lots of great things can happen.

Carlous is in a comfortable '7.5' position, because I'd certainly not mind playing it again - but only with the 'right' kind of people.  Those people are going to be 'gamers' - but 'gamers' in the sense that these can be the abstract gamers, the chess fans, checkers, so on and so forth.  The game is very accessible in this way, but not on a grand scale.  I'm glad it was recommended.

One of the best 3 player games I've played. 
The play primary mechanic is to collect cubes to get a majority in a region. I like how areas can be combined to make your position stronger.
Much is made on how position can change based on die rolls. However to me, making the best of the assortment of cubes is what makes the game.  
As a 3 player gives you the option to make a play to get your opponents into conflict with each other as well as help your own position.

Challenging game with game mechanics that are individually simple yet combine in ways to make a surprisingly deep exercise in tactics.

Rather dry and calculating but fast playing abstract game with similarities to Attila with its influence/majority scoring track. Strange game, unsure if it just comes down to lucky rolls when resupplying your provinces or if it really does reward over-analysing the board. Works well with any number of players, but pairs often results in the losing team simply duffing their resupply roll first.

(+) Unique abstract that blends a rondel like mechanism with ara majority escapades. High player interacton will result but the are opprtunies to strategize in the long term make use of the dynamic game space.  
(+) Plays smoothly each turn--there are no seemingly excessive mechanisms present here.

One of the best influence games I've played. Slight more luck in obtaining the bits to place than El Grande, but it has its own unique creative nature to make it different than El Grande, and a fun lighter game.

One play - but felt the game played me instead of the other way around.  I must be missing something and doing something very wrong in my turns or decisions.  Every time I had a move to take over a territory - others moved ahead of me to usurp that move.  Always felt I was behind in the paladin control having none or one color most of the time in a 3 player game.  Willing to play the game a few more times to see if it improves - but first impressions less than enjoyable for me.

I love small games of this.  One on One is excellent strategy blended with a bit of luck.  I play where you decide for your first replacement cube, then roll for the rest, preventing bad dice rolls from completely screwing up the game.

Kind of a chaotic, see-sawing tussle, but we've always had fun playing it and that works in my book. Easy to learn and play. A good length. I especially like the variants you can employ to spice up the game for players who like a little more strategy (roll dice again for colours you don't want, make any die roll wild, etc), or a little more wacky (hide left side cube stocks for each player). Plays well with teams at four players, but best with three. I dislike the two player game.

Rating given when using a couple of choice variants - otherwise (especially with one dice roll and/or two players), it definitely drops a rating point or two. i.e. I'm not interested in playing it.

RATING: 7
Abstract majority game in which players take control of zones and then connect them when they have two zones next to each other.  It has more luck dependance than other Colovini's because of the cube draw and the dice.  Nevertheless it is not a bad game.

I played this for the first (and second) time last week, and despite losing, I think the game is very clever and I really enjoyed it. Area control, very basic... you can either strengthen your hold on a color, or place pieces of that color on the board - and there are 5 different colors in the game! You can't control all of them, and if you start putting cubes on the board, you risk someone overtaking you.

I do wish there was a rule that let you discard X cubes and draw X new ones, at the cost of not placing cubes that turn - or maybe discard 2 to choose any one, up to 4 times, then you roll the dice to refill.

First game impressed me with marvelous mechanics but worried me with an interminable end-game. It's come off of my want list as a result, but deserves another try. Second game was a little better, pushing it toward a game I'm willing to play. Overall, Colovini often has problems with scoring systems breaking down if players don't do the right thing (cf Alexandros, Go West), and I suspect that was th eissue here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A dry Colovini offering that somehow works. The bits are magnificent. Gameplay is good with 2 or 4 but patchy with 3 (potential for a player to have too much dominance in one or two colours and suddenly, the game ends).

The die rolling can really damage a player especially when he/she wants certain colours to keep up their gameplan. But it works.

Wish the theme would suit the game more.

This game is a fascinating study of manipulating mechanics to make a stock game seem like an area control game.  There is some really neat ideas in this that make you feel like you are playing something new and exciting.  Of course, you can only enjoy this if you can pretend that the moves that you are acting out are making any difference to game play, rather than which cubes you earn on the dice roll.  I have a hard time believing that you have any control, but it is worth a little faith in the designer for the experience.  That said it is a fun exercise, and you can easily dilute yourself into thinking that this is an actual game.  I will say that if you have problems with games where you can't do anything significant for a couple turns or games where the onus of preventing another player's win (ala Kill Dr Lucky or Attika) irritates you then avoid this like a plague.

Interesting and dynamic mechanisms, especially with 3 or 4 -- and it is one of the very few 4-player, partner board games. Unfortunately, "unlucky" rolls can make for a runaway leader and/or a sudden shift in control, thus ruining a previously brilliant strategy and leaving a very bad feeling for the game if you are on the "unlucky" side of the die rolls.

On the fence about this one right now. Played 2 player version and it went too quickly for my taste. I think it would make a superb 3 player game. Report forthcoming.

Update 6/3/06: Played the 3 player version and the game is indeed superb. It reminded me alot of El Grande with the area control and some luck factor thrown in with the dice. Would rather play a three player version of this game than San Marco any day. Upgraded to an 8.0. Looking forward to playing again.

Update 11/7/06: Played again and lost to Mr. Squires. Damn you Squires! A fantastic three player. Right up there with Blue Moon City and Lost Valley.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent area control game.  I like how there are two aspects to the game - trying to control the regions balanced with trying to influence a particular set of mercenaries.  There also is a small auction mechanic in choosing who gets to go first, which also affects which regions you can vie for control.  Since there are dice, some luck is involved here, but I think it spices up the game nicely.  Only complaint I'd have is that separating the land masses into little islands stretches the theme a bit thin.

UPDATE: Played again and I think the dice dictate a bit too much of the strategy.  Still, this is a fun and enjoyable ride.

RATING: 9
One of my favourite games for three players, which is the only way to play. It's very mathematical and game-theoretical. The way players manipulate turn order is brilliant: you're often able to force your opponents into suboptimal play. Good strategy involves manipulating players to work against each other. One great move often wins the game, in many cases dramatically. 

I love games that allow me to induce my opponents into giving me the win, particularly if it happens without them realizing what I've done. Carolus Magnus is that kind of game, not all the time, but often enough that it's among my very favourites. Played at a high enough level, it's an incentive manipulation game. There's luck, yes, but I haven't found it at all overwhelming. Besides, there are lower luck variants.

RATING: 7
It's nice to have a full-blown Eurogame that is great with 2 or 3.  You can also take it out of the box and carry it in a much smaller container.  4 players is just 2 teams.  This is one of my typical 3-player games to suggest.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty good game, but it just doesn't hit the table very much. Hard for me to wrap my head around this one; well, to do it well, anyway. A little too abstract for my tastes.

-----------------
SPIELBOX VARIANT (to reduce dice luck)
Makes for a more tactical game (and playing first is even more crucial because you have the largest variety of cubes). 
Make sure you have the same amount of cubes in each color to keep the odds even! 

SETUP
1) Start game by regularly determining the 7 cubes for each player (roll of dice). 
2) All remaining cubes are put into a bag. 
3) Randomly draw a set of 3 cubes out of the bag and place it in the center; repeat this until you have one more set than participating players. 

GAME PLAY
1) After a player's turn (i.e. after moving Carolus) he can freely choose any one of the cube-sets for replenishing (no dice needed): if more than 3 cubes in the set, keep 3 and return excess to the bag.
2) When all players have taken their turns, at the end of the round only one set of cubes remains. Add one randomly drawn cube from the bag to this set.
3) Draw as many new sets of 3 cubes as players in the game (resulting again in one more set than player number)

An original design that makes my brain work in a different way.  I like the combination of dice and an abstract.  In fact, if it was a pure abstract somehow, it would rate lower.  It's one of those games that hits the table every year or two, then your brain needs the rest.

One of the best 3 player games ever, and a pretty good run at the title for 2 players.  This is quite the brain-burner if you play with the excellent Spielbox variant.  Haven't played the 4 player partnership version, but there's a lot of games on the 4 player list--not so much in the 3 player realm.  If you want to fill a niche for a 2 player game that plays even better with 3 you can't do better than this!

Don't look here for "dripping with theme" though, this is an abstract in historical clothing--and not much at that, maybe an historical bikini....

RATING: 6.5
[Winning Moves 2000 edition] {Kingdom; 2-level area-majority, dice-rolling, partnership; scalable} A novel area-majority game, where one has to control both the area and the paladins. It's my favorite game of Colovini.

The game is different for 2, 3 or 4 players:
- 2 is chess-like
- 3 is more confrontational and dynamic, and more things to consider
- 4 is more fun with partnership

The game is challenging because players have to strive to control both the territory and paladin. Usually, one will find that he doesn't have enough resources to do all he wants in a turn. It's full of agonizing decisions: place paladins to the board to increase the influence or to enrich one's power, play which token to move the knights and get player order, how does one plan the next few moves, what other will do, etc? In all, players have many tactical options and need to plan ahead a few rounds in order to win.

Some players may find the dice-rolling frustrating.  It's true that a series of bad rolls can let a player lose the game. To reduce the luck, one can try the variant proposed by Faidutti. Nonetheless, I play this game as is because I don't want the game become too brain-teasing / calculative and there are no unfair events, due to dice rolls, in most of my games. 

CM has a lot of wooden cubes, where are very useful for other games. However, I don't like the BIG box, which makes the game hard to store. I wonder if it's possible to have miniatures instead of the boring wooden cubes :P

Una partida a dos y otra a tres. Me parece un juego abstracto con un tema que podÃ­a haber sido cualquier otra cosa, pero que no le resta mÃ©ritos. Un juego en el que los cubos tanto sirven para controlar un color como para obtener la mayorÃ­a en las zonas de territorios. Es esa gestiÃ³n la que ofrece la miga al juego. Tengo que jugar unas cuantas partidas mÃ¡s para ir sacÃ¡ndole lo mucho que tiene de sÃ­. Muy interesante y vistoso. Aparentemente simple, pero muy profundo. Con decisiones complicadas en cada turno.// Con dos partidas por parejas debo decir que es un juego muy rÃ¡pido, aunque ya de por sÃ­ lo es el juego. En ambas partidas no hemos llegado a ir mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de los cinco turnos, es decir, hemos gastado los discos una vez.

Cool-looking game with some really neat mechanics. Sort of like a faster more abstract El Grande with some sneaky tricks up its sleeve. All of this being said, the luck seems to be too much. I heard about a variant to reduce the luck and I'm eager to try it, as there is much to like here.

EDIT: Played the variant I mentioned, and I can confirm that the game seems much better with reduced luck in gaining new cubes. I'm not big on house rules and almost never play with them, but this is one I will probably stick with.

Have only played the two-player version, but it is quick, with tough decisions each turn, and has quite unique gameplay. It's an area majority game, but plays different enough from the rest to set it apart. Beautiful game with tons of wooden bits, and plays in under an hour.

Interesting Colovini game I certainly feel his design style in this one. I think I'd rather play Clans but this was fun.

Sometimes you play a game that's a multiplayer game and just feel like it was designed to be a 2 player game. This is one of those instances. Yes the game does in fact play well with up to 4 players, I'm not saying it doesn't, but when you want that head to head struggle, this game fits that bill perfectly as a 2 player game.

RATING: 7
There are 15 territories arranged in a circle, and five colors of cubes. You spend cubes to try to have majority/plurality of the respective color (like buying stock), or else you place the cubes in the territories, where they count as votes towards your area majority there if you have the most "stock" in that color.

When the emperor pawn lands in a territory, the majority winner gets to put a castle there (replacing one already there if necessary; there can only be one castle per territory tile), and this castle counts as an inherent vote for that player thenceforth. Furthermore, adjacent territories with the same player's castles in them are automatically merged into a single territory, making them harder to take over. Thus as the game proceeds players' holdings are increasingly solidified, making the end conditions of the game basically coincide with the beginnings of stalemate, which feels natural.

Player actions are restricted in two ways. First, the colors of the cubes a player has is determined purely by die roll. Secondly, players bid a chip numbered from 1-5 each round, with the lower numbers winning turn order advantage in exchange for reduced flexibility in where the emperor pawn can be moved. Every five rounds you get your chips back.

I like the game, but I have trouble playing it well and perceive it as chaotic. I find it too short to be happy with it being chaotic. Between this and Mykerinos I think I arrive at the conclusion that pure area majority, without any negotiation, isn't enough for me.

Good game.  I wish the luck factor was a touch less in regards to rolling for cubes.  Otherwise would rate a 8.  Very different game with 3 or 4 player.  4 player you play with a partner, both good.  Love the player order also determines how far you move, wish more games had this mechanic.

A abstract game here with a thin theme but plenty of chances to plot and plan ahead , the random part of the game , the roll to see what you will recieve next time can easily fixed by rolling at the start of your turn to see what will happen next time and give one a foresight and planning advantage.A thinking game and  rather good fun .

Not a bad little abstract. It's almost a rondel game in the way Big Carl moves, in addition to having limited options due to moving and cube limitations. It feels like a smarter version of Masons.

It's very much a turn-by-turn tactical exercise; what can I do with the resources I have at the moment? I've come to appreciate Colovini's focus on tactics in all his games, and it feels particularly apt here. Though I appreciate Clans more for it's higher degree of control, I like CM for (rather than in spite of) it's randomized element.

RATING: 1
A truly horrible game.  The worst game I've ever played.  The experience is absolutely broken in half by the randomness.  If the knight refill was not random either player chosen or based on the result of the action you took there could be more game here.  As it is you might as well just roll dice a few times to see who wins, save yourself 59 minutes, and play a better game.  There are some interesting mechanics but in the three games I've played with three players I've seen one player completely locked out from controlling any colour despite not having placed any knights on to the board in two of those games.

This will surely take another play or two before the opinionated drivel that follows can be taken seriously, but my first impression is that it is a harmless little puzzle that plays quickly enough to not be unpleasant. I really enjoy the team aspect. I think it is the first team game I've played other than Tichu-- and that alone is worth a point or two in my ranking (Without the team angle this would surely be a 4/5.) I also liked the little look-ahead puzzle: it was a fresher sort of if-then-then-ooops! than many games I have played recently. But my main gripe is that the dice are running the show. I think the puzzle gives an illusion of control, when really the dice laugh behind our mortal backs. The end game swings that are possible, in conjunction with a good roll / bad roll, make the idea of "winner / loser" sort of meaningless. This is in the family of complaints leveled at  the final round of Winner's Circle-- if the last bet is worth so much more than the first two, and can overcome the 1st two round scores, why bother playing the first two rounds at all? In this game, with the ability to swing a massive grouping so dramatically one way or another on a dice roll toward the end of the game, why bother playing the lead up?

This is an area majority game turned up on its side and shaken around a bit to make something similar, yet also different.  The way that the islands collect during the course of the game means that each game will be a little different, which is perfect, since this game is essentially an abstract design.  The dice add a much-needed random element to the game, since otherwise it would be a perfect information game, which would in turn lead to a scripted sort of play each game.

This is a middle-weight game where players compete to control territories by holding the majority of pieces.  If a player holds adjacent territories they merge into one, so the modular board is always changing.  A very unique and competitive game.

i enjoy this game. i don't know why people are hung up that 'it's too abstract' no more than many el grande type region games. also, 'too much luck' is a cop-out too...you make the most of the commodities you have to place you in the best posible positioning. great game as a 3 or 4 player and quick too...has been a while since it's hit the table though...Now it's back..been played a little bit more, with more appreciation to the subtleties..I've decided that the 4 player partnership is without a doubt the way to play this game, although 3 player is good too, 4 player adds more elements of strategy, with the ability to create a consecutive 4 player turn..also there is lots of collusion between partners, discussing optimal moves and listening to the plans of the opposition. A great mid weight game.

(TRADE Interest: low) fun beginning and middle, too long to the end, and too much of a kingmaker complex.  we did play one rule wrong (because the rules are wrong), and that is that you "may" join territories when you build two adjoining castles.  you MUST join the territories.  not sure if that would have changed an hour game into a three hour game, but just in case, i'll play again.

One of the few games I have ever played that is as solid with 2 as it is with 3 or 4. An excellent game of tough decision-making, and a strong design sense to pull together a rather abstract strategy concoction. While it may first appear "dry" I find the game rather lush and engaging.

At first I thought Carolus Magnus is a pretty clever game in how you manipulate the color paladins in area control, until I realized that die roll is everything.  You can plan several moves ahead as much as you want, but if you never get the colors you need while your opponent cut into the color(s) of your choice, well, no matter how skillful you play, you are screwed.  I like the method by which the play order is determined, but that doesn't negate how luck-ridden this game is.  I don't deny that strategic planning of the placement of your cubes are a big part of the game, but I'm not a fan when the difference between winning and losing is determined how well you roll the dice.  No thanks.

Rating based on one three-player game.  Wow.  There's a lot going on here for some little wooden cubes & castles, and cardboard territories.

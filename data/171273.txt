Great Co-op or the BEST co-op? Be prepared to lose, but this is a game that could actively be used as a team building/communication exercise. Communication and clear, concise instruction and planning is necessary to win on higher difficulties.

Fuse is fantastic co-op game!
You'll fail miserably the first few times - or even first 12 times - but you'll want to try again and again to save your spaceship.
The free app that comes with the game (with the countdown clock and the smarmy computer voice)  really add a lot of atmosphere.
Tense, fun and scales really well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple and relatively fun 10min filler activity. Setup is a breeze and Renegade's free mobile app adds some nice thematic tension.

The strategy in Fuse is essentially limited to the following: 
1. "Don't take on multiple high-level bombs if you don't have to."
2. "Don't leave a leftover die with a color that matches a die someone just took."
3. "Go fast!"

For many, Fuse will fit the bill as an occasional novelty. — For folks who struggle under pressure, Fuse has tremendous potential to devolve into a frustrating 10 minute stress exercise.
Either way, the game ends quickly enough that most people won't mind playing along at least once.

Recommended for real-time junkies.

A real time game that I find tolerable! It's pretty easy at 5, but it's interesting. I like the dice drafting and the thematic element of "if you knock it over, start over".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid game.  You have 10 minutes to roll dice and diffuse bombs by completing sequences of numbers, colours or patterns using the dice.

The bomb cards are laid out well, the symbology is pretty intuitive so you should be able to tell at a glance what is required.

A tricky game to complete, but it does get easier over time as you get used to the cards and get faster at recognising and placing the dice.

A great filler game and a lot of fun.

The only negative I have is with the free timer app.  I love the atmospheric background noise and narration but it absolutely hammers the battery on my Android phone.  On a full charge, if I'm quick, I can just about play 4 games before the device is completely discharged.  Renders it pretty useless unless I'm playing at home.

3/21/16: Introduced to this at Gamestorm by Rachel.  It's a lot of fun, and and a great filler.  A co-op that emphasizes communication and speed.  Because of the timer it's only going to last 10 minutes.

It takes teamwork and speed, which makes it a lot better than a lot of other fillers.

It's going to take a lot for me to rate a filler above a seven, so this is pretty good.

A chaotic, co-op game that plays almost as quickly as it takes to explain and greatly negates quaterbacking? Count me in.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: I'm not a big fan of real-time games, finding them fairly stressful. I'm also not a big fan of cooperative games. However, this game seems to merge the two mechanisms to make for a compelling game. Having to work together to decide who will get which dice, while listening to an app taunting us in the background, makes for a stressful but somehow enjoyable puzzle. The 10 minute game length makes for a quick playtime and leaves us wanting to play it "just one more time".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
FUSE provides an interesting experience as a quick, cooperative multiplayer game. More specifically, FUSE does a good job of facilitating interaction between players and escalating the tension felt by everyone at the table. Everyone is engaged for the entire ten minutes and the game play thrives on social interaction as dice priorities and desired selections are communicated. Due to the experience it provides, whether you win or lose is unimportant. Embrace the randomness and enjoy the atmosphere that FUSE facilitates. It's probably a 7 if I was to rate only its multiplayer experience.

However, the box also advertises it as a solo game, and its pretty awful as a solo experience. All the engaging decisions between the players is gone. And without the interactivity of the multiplayer game, you are generally left with 2 decisions: which dice locations to prioritize and which bomb cards to pull after defusing a bomb. These decisions are simply not very interesting and have little impact on achieving a win condition. Essentially, the solo experience is reduced to a timed dice rolling exercise to see if the multiple randomized variables are in your favor. Whether you even have a chance of success is up to the dice and cards. The timer still creates some tension, but adding a time crunch does not overcome the lack of decision making that occurs throughout the 10 minutes. The solo experience gets a 2-3. 

My overall rating will be a combination of the two.

Edit, August 2017: After playing this at a play count of 2, this gets moved a bit lower. It's not much better at 2 than at 1. At 2 players, you have one more decision to occasionally make: if you can both use a die, which player gets it. The answer to that question boils down, most often, to who has the more difficult card. This game needs 3+ players.

RATING: 9
Let me start by saying that FUSE is a fun game that is easy to learn, but not easy to win. I'm fairly certain that I lost my first 10 games in a row, at the easiest level. I even tried doubling the time the first few games and still couldn't win!

FUSE combines the idea of dice rolling, set collecting, dexterity, and a timer to make an intense gaming experience. This could almost be a party game, with all the yelling and semi-cooperative nature. It's great for finding out who the "marshall" of the group is, with them urging everyone to move quicker. I wasn't hot on this game at first, discouraged by my limited success, but after winning in a solitaire game and them getting a good group together and winning as a team, I think this game is dynamite! Get it? Because the theme is diffusing bombs? 

...

Anyways, the other people at my board game night were begging to play it again, even after a loss, so that is always a good sign. Also, I definitely recommend the free companion app, as the personality voice with the timer made the game that much more entertaining.

Kind of bought it on a whim due to Rahdo's solo-games list and because it's more on the cheap side. 

It's great because of selection of different diffuse bombs cards and the variable difficulty but I'm simply not always in the mood for it. I prefer to be rewarded for thinky-ness rather than DO THIS THING AS FAST AS YOU CAN, OH GOD.

It's a cool filler game to have around for game nights too since it has a time-cap

I enjoy games that require players to run against a time limit since they need to think fast and take decisions on the spot and stick to them, without second thoughts: moreover, as an additional benefit, this prevents analysis paralysis too and cuts down downtime.

As such, I enjoyed Fuse deeply, which is a solid cooperative filler with enough puzzles and dice to keep me and my gaming friends busy ten minutes at a time: solving the game can be both a piece of cake and a challenge, as it can be scaled to a group’s needs and skills easily.

*Note - Based on near-final game play with prototype artwork.*

Fast, frenetic dice rolling game where players are cooperatively trying to defuse bombs within a time limit.

Dice are rolled, and players all claim dice from the rolled dice, trying to satisfy the goals on the cards (each player has 2 cards at a time) they're currently working on.  You'll be working on cards where you need dice of certain colors or values.  Some cards are harder/more advanced than others.

Of course, everyone needs certain stuff, so you're quickly trying to determine how to get a useful die to each player.  You only have 10 minutes to win the game, so you can't sit and optimize everything out.  But, you need to do a pretty good job of optimizing as well; if a player can't use the die they got, bad things happen.

If the players get through the card deck before 10 minutes, the bomb is defused and everyone high fives on a job well done.  If not, the bomb explodes in a MacGruber-esque ending.  Fun stuff!

Chaotic and exciting, a good alternative to Escape if you're looking for another game in that niche.  I enjoy how difficult it can be as well and it keeps you engaged the entire time.

With that being said, this is a 10 minute filler and it's not going to change your life or give you swag.  It's good filler though.  

I do think it could benefit from some expansions and more depth/variety in mechanisms.  Some additional vector besides the main dice placement would be nice.  Escape has it beat here with several really strong expansions that vary play quite strongly.

This one was a total surprise for me. I hadn't even heard of it, but a friend bought it and after examining the box those magic words were uttered: "Well, it only takes ten minutes. Let's try it out."

Next thing we knew we'd played five games of it. Simply put: this isn't the most interesting co-op puzzle you're ever going to play, but this is a totally solid and satisfying little game. There's a lot of real-time co-op games out there, but most of them are, at best, intimidating. Good intro level real-time games are rare - and this is exactly that. The closest point of comparison for complexity & depth I can think of is the Escape series. Fuse is much more abstract, but the time pressure and - the big highlight - player interaction keep it suspenseful and engaging. Negotiating under pressure gets the spotlight here, with everyone being actively asked to participate.

Multiple difficulty levels also give it nice replayability out of the box - add to that it being portable and relatively cheap and it's pretty hard not to recommend. Well played, Fuse.

This is a realtime coop which lasts 10 minutes, just like Escape: The Curse of the Temple. However, unlike Escape with its various expansions, I don't think Fuse has good replayability. Don't get me wrong, I've played it 8 times, so that's quite a bit, but on the other hand that is less than 80 minutes spend on the game, and I'm not sure I want to spend another 80. The main reason is that the game doesn't really *feel* like a coop - you're basically saying each turn which die you need and grab that, and rarely pay attention to the other players. Of course, if they need the same die, you have to agree and such, but still, it just didn't feel very "coop-y" to me; more like multiplayer solitaire. While there are lots of clever mechanics, and the cards really are different and some extremely tough to pull off (especially the 6 point cards!), it's just an "okay" game for me. "Okay +" I guess. Would play again, but don't need to own.

I normally don't like real time games because I game for the relaxation as opposed to the stress of beating a clock. However, I rather enjoyed this solo as it was challenging and the immense variety in the cards each game ensures it is a different challenge every time. I'll likely never be the fastest player at this so the lower levels are great and I like the fact that you can still score after each game although I typically don't after a loss I could. I'll need to see what my wife thinks of this one, but she may enjoy this one too. A definite surprise hit for me even as a solo game.

One positive I will say is that I was able to learn almost all the rules just by watching the game be played for 2 minutes. But games like this and Escape, they are just not my dicehouse. It was very meh to me. We nearly won. While I didn't feel super tense like you do in Escape, the gameplay was kind of dull to me. There's no theme or art to excite me either.

This game is great. It is quick to set up, quick to teach, & quick to play. You can always find 10 minutes to play & if you don't have people to play with, it plays well solo too!
Difficulty scales well and there are many options for how to change it, not just the number of cards used, but also the difficulty level of the cards (can "stack the deck with a mix of your choice). It makes it easy to adjust for playing with younger or less experienced gamers. Accessible to everyone!

RATING: 2
Mechanically very lightweight cooperative game but is somehow satisfying and aggravating in equal measure in that players are forced to make quick joint decisions about what to do. 10 minute game time limit is a big plus when all you want is a brainless filler and Escape has too much going on/possible downtime/takes too long to set up. 

Some of the harder level 4 card are nigh impossible to complete and gamebteaking.

RATING: 6.5
I enjoy this game, but it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. It needs some kind of variant to mitigate unlucky rolls. I was thinking of possibly using defused bombs to change a pip value +/- the value of the card. So, there would be the tension of paying victory points to get past  a difficult card. It would be interesting if I could somehow let players change the color of a die as well, but that might be too fiddly to deal with.

RATING: 5
A speed game where you don't have to worry about re-rolling over and over....   just one roll, but you quickly have to divide up the dice.   There are a lot of penalties that are applied during the 10 minutes, and that makes it a bit of a drag, as progress feels like it happens a lot less often than penalties.   Still, it provides a good timed challenge.   It's not easy.

This is such a fun game.  Lots of Dice Rolling, and player interaction.  The app is great as it provides tension (and humor) through the timer.  However the app does drain battery quickly.  

some of bomb cards can be challenging to figure out at first, and you can find yourself stuck.  I think 2 player is much harder than 4 player, as with 2 player each person must try to take 2 dice, where with 4 you just take 1 each.  funny how more choices can increase the tension. 

Love the fact it is a 10 minute game, setup and breakdown super easy (now with a custom built insert).

An exciting, tense, but super fun 10 minute solo/co-op about defusing bombs. It was easy to learn and I love the companion app so I don't have to keep glancing at a timer. The 'personality' voice cracks me up :laugh: Have lost this game every single time but man is it addictive and a BLAST to play! I've only played co-op twice but I really bought it for solo play and it is GREAT for that :thumbsup:

I love that you have a big enough deck of cards that you are not cycling through the same cards all of the time, and you select such a small number of cards that you are never sure what cards will come out in the game. However, I'd love to see a small expansion for this (about 20 or so new cards) with special configurations (eg. L, U, E, T, H etc. or like 2 ended stack cards) because most of the cards provided are so linear.

You have 10 minutes.  Roll dice and use the colour and number of the dice to fill the requirements of a card (combinations of numbers, colours, greater than, less, than and equal to).  Can't place a dice?  Ok roll that dice, each player has to remove that colour or number off one of their cards they are working on if they can.

This all sounds very easy, and it is, until you have to complete 20+ cards as quickly as possible with minimal waste and brief, efficient communication.

Don't play this game with people who don't co-operate or handle stress well.  You don't know stress until you're down to less than the second left and pulling off the Hail Mary dice roll to save the game.  Fuse is a game that will great for some players and definitely not for others. Hectic fun!

I won't give this less than a '6' because I'm sure this is a game for people who like dice rolling and speed games. The game works for what it is. But it's fairly random (dice... I know) and ultra punishing (in a random way) and not very interesting. My review of any speed game is: "would this game get a fail if there wasn't a timing aspect?" Absolutely in this case. It's just rolling and matching dice to cards and there's a social aspect that you sort of have to rush anyway because really taking the time to consider which dice should go where means that everyone will probably lose. So, you kind of just keep taking dice and placing them on cards and losing dice and getting more cards and more dice and placing more dice and etc. etc.  It's also kinda fiddly with the drawing of and rolling and placing and revealing new cards, etc. etc.  So... again... this still works for what it is and it doesn't deserve a worse rating which I would save for that special brand of game that didn't try to achieve what it set out to do. FUSE does. It just isn't a very good game considering everything else that is out there.  Okay, I might have give this one whole extra mark because the dice are great quality!

Zadania na kartach są dosyć zróżnicowane, raczej proste, choć nie znaczy to wcale, że proste do wykonania.

Got this one out tonight planning 2-3 games max for my first pass. Ended up playing 6 it was so much fun. I started right away with the standard setup (19 bombs and 6 fuse) with none of the 6 value point cards. Pulled a win in the 4th and 6th games with my high score being 77. I will add the companion app is really cool, certainly a must have. No only do you get the thematic timer but the voice and sound effects are great, plus it lets you track your top scores. I love Escape, before tonight it was my favorite real time game. I never play it solo though, always found it to be much more fun with a group. I may actually enjoy this one more solo than with a group, we will see. It really works perfectly. Very much a like a puzzle with every die allocation and selection from the middle of the table is important. A few times I found myself in spots where I only had a few options available. Generally I lost those games. The dice only wrecked me one game, I ended up getting two really bad draws/rolls in a row which resulted re-rolls and subsequent removal of dice all over the place. 

Will post again to see how it is holding up when I hit 20 plays.

Fuse is a really entertaining real-time co-op that only lasts 10 minutes. This is an excellent weight and length for my tastes that gives just the right burst of intensity. Space Alert, for example, can be a bit too much for me. With Fuse, the stakes feel high, but if you lose, you can just try again and see your team improving together through a series of plays in a very short period of time. Perfect for what it is.

It's simply ok. For a timed, frantic game there are a lot of little annoying rules that get in the way that can make some plays of this grind to a halt. 

Why can't one player take more than one die? Why must we keep passing the bag around? Why do we have to throw all dice back if we accidentally reach in and grab more than we're supposed to? 

I've played Escape:Curse of the Temple and Zombie 15' and have thoroughly enjoyed both, FUSE doesn't scratch that same itch I was hoping it would, and many players of my game group didn't really like it at all compared to the prior two. It's ok, it's not horrible but definitely not a favorite

Fast paced dice rolling game about defusing a bomb in 10 minutes. Unfortunately it does not come with any kind of timing mechanism so you are forced to either use your phone (they have a timing app for Android and iOS) or a generic timer of your own. For me the game is incomplete as a result but it is still fun to play while your phone battery lasts.

I really enjoy the challenge put forth, though I have yet to win a game.  I will probably customize the rules when playing with my 8-year-old.

This is my Anti-game. It's definitely a very smart design and some real thought and effort has gone into it, no doubt. I think it's one for people who are looking for a challenge more than a gaming experience. All I got out of it was a feeling of despondency and hopelessness and real regret at not having picked up a different game. I do like real time pressure in a game (XCOM, Escape etc) and I love coop experiences. I just don't see any reason to play this at all, it stresses us all out and we don't have any fun and those two things are the polar opposites to why we play games in the first place.

Basically just speed dice rolling. There are some obvious things you can do like make sure your two cards don't have too similar of requirements, but mostly it comes down to drawing out the right color dice and rolling the right numbers. I guess that's mostly fine for a game that only takes 10 minutes, but I'm personally not that excited by it.

This is slick.  A co-operative game where nobody can take control and/or boss the other players around (and if they can, you're not playing with enough bombs in the deck.)

Over the course of 3 or 4 cracks at this, you'll watch any given group learn to communicate with each other in its own way, new shorthand will arise, more efficient ways of flipping cards and moving things around . . . and as you get better and better (not just at the game, but at problem solving with this group of people), you'll perform your collective tasks quicker and quicker.  A great shared experience.  (And lots of intangibles going for it - easy to explain, quick setup and tear-down, play is exactly ten minutes, so you don't get stuck if someone's not having a good time.)

RATING: 8
Fuse is another entry in the increasingly common real-time cooperative game genre and is one of the best examples of how to do it. The game does what the best cooperative games do - prevent quarterbacking and force players to know when to be selfish and when to be generous. It plays quickly and has that "just one more play, we can do better" feel that keeps the game replayable. If you don't automatically say no to the real-time and co-op genres, Fuse belongs in your collection.

Real-time game that involves rolling and cooperatively drafting dice in order to satisfy number/color conditions on cards.  I can see the appeal of it, as it is a manic rush to try to coordinate and do.  We had difficulty getting this to work ok as a 2 player game.  The issue is that handing the bag back and forth and coordinating the die rolls and penalties was a lot of upkeep for such a fast-paced experience.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2016)

Before playing it, I have never even heard of the game, but I liked it. FUSE is a cooperative game reminiscent of Escape: The Curse of the Temple. Players have 10 minutes to defuse a set amount of bombs, but unlike Escape, a player only rolls once per turn and then, collectively, decide which is the best course for the group.

The rules are dead easy, you can explain them under 8 minutes and playtime is 10 minutes, so the game plays very fast making it easy to play it multiple times more before putting it away. 

The game components are very well done and the iconography is pretty clear to us.

The decisions needed to win the game aren’t very complex, but as you are pressed by time, it is very fun to play. We have only managed to win the training difficulty, but we get better with the each play through. It is MUCH better to play with the timer app, the voice and sound effects really add to the atmosphere.

Bottom line, FUSE is a good family/filler game. I will buy in the near future.

Current Rating: 6.5

Fun game with one change, the player with a unusable dies discards any one die instead of rerolling and everyone discarding. The rule as written RUINS the game and drops my raiding to two stars.

I enjoy the game solo. Since I can have it setup, played, scored and taken down in about 15 minutes, it is really good for those times when I just don't have much time to play a game. Where the game really shines though is in multiplayer. FUSE is an incredible multiplayer game. Learning how to communicate quickly and efficiently while still making quick decisions and while stacking dice is quite a bit of fun! :)

Our first real-time game and a very enjoyable experience! 10 minutes seems like plenty of time but it can certainly get frenetic as you try to quickly draft the dice to defuse the bombs. Very addictive! We played 4 games in a row both times we cracked it open :)

RATING: 7.5
Tense real-time co-op dice game.  Nicely varied dice combinations make for lots of anxious interactions.  Luck-driven, obviously, both in dice and bomb cards, but decision-making emphasis compensates a lot of it.  Between that, naturally ramping tension and short game time a consistently welcome play.  Awesome as gamenight filler!

This is the kind of co-op that is able to side-step the alpha gamer conundrum. Alpha gamers become a problem when everyone shares the same information and goals. In Fuse, while everyone is contributing to the goal of defusing X number of bombs, everyone is working only on the bombs in front of them. It is impossible for any one player to know, or try to know, what everyone needs and should take. 

While Escape is a game about frantically rolling dice to get what you need, Fuse is about frantically negotiating which dice to claim after they have been rolled. Players start with bomb cards in front of them and five displayed on the table with a draw deck whose size depends on the number of players and the difficulty level. The object is solve all of the cards in the deck (20+ including start cards). Each card has a different combination of dice colors and numbers that must be placed to defuse the bomb and discard the card. Every turn, the next player draws dice from a bag (equal to the player count) and rolls them. Each player takes one of the dice to add to their bombs. If any dice aren't claimed, they are re-rolled and each player needs to discard a die of a matching color or number. Shuffled into the deck are "fuse" cards that also cause players to remove a specific color or number from their cards. When a card is solved, the dice are put back in the bag and another card is taken from the middle. When all bombs have been defused, the game ends. There is a thematic timer app you can download and use if you wish.

Fuse is an addictive and challenging game that you want to play again and again in order to beat. Not sure how much longevity it will have, since the game play is repetitive and strategy is limited. But for now, this is a good game to get in a "quick fix"!

The desperation of the number you can't roll or not being able to draw that one color you all need. This game is tense and so much fun. You really feel like you are up against the clock trying to defuse that bomb and your life depends on it. Just got it and played 5 times already so this should mean something. Absolutely recommend it. After a while we feel escape is better.

I've played this with 1, 2, 3, and 4 players. The rules are definitely weighted against two-player games. It is super frustrating and punishing to play the two-player version, since you end up having to lose your progress pretty much every turn due to unused dice. The four-player group I brought this to complained about the penalty for unused dice, too, even though it was not as harsh as for 2-players. The comment I recall is that, in a timed game, dice you can't use are their own penalty (since it takes time to determine this and re-draw), so why should players be punished again? And why should [i]every single player[/i] lose progress for [i]one[/i] unused die? Where does that fit in thematically? Jimmy can't use the red wire cutters, so the wire cutters simultaneously bash into all the rest of our separate workstations and knock things over? Solo games are more reasonable, with the player rolling 3 dice at once and being allowed to take all 3 onto the 4 active cards. It was rare to come across the unused-die penalty in solo plays. This game was not sufficiently play-tested before its release.

Surprisingly impressed with this one!  This is a 10 minute timed game, similar to Escape, but this isn't about rolling dice as fast as you can and exploring a temple, it is about rolling a set number of dice and then divvying them up and allocating them to bomb cards with specific "recipe" requirements on them in order to defuse them.  (Adjust the deck size of bomb cards to adjust difficulty.)  Each player needs to place a die, or the unused dice are rolled and matching numbers or colors need to be put back in the bag from the bomb cards (one for each player).  The trick is to quickly determine who needs what to optimize the dice distribution to everyone.  There is also a solo game, which is very good and very hard!  :-)  This one interested me, but after playing it, it really did surprise me with how much fun it was.

A tough co-op. The rules are very simple, so it's easy to teach even to kids. It's pretty hectic though, so not one to play if you're looking to relax.

Hectic dice rolling game complete with bomb defusing tension. All of the different "bombs" are unique and complex enough to make the theme believable. Fun one to break out for those that are a fan of the genre.

RATING: 7
FUN. BUT...dice roller and luck. 

We beat it once and that was because we had one die and 3 minutes...the annoying thing was. We just had to keep rolling that die until we got the side we needed.

This game is fun in the case that you are doing puzzles with friends to diffuse bombs, but when you get to the last bomb with enough time it is just dumb because you are rerolling until you get it, which is not strategical at all. 

Replay value: It's there, but only if you really enjoy doing the puzzles against the timer.

Only played a couple of rounds of this game solo and I enjoyed the experience. I suspect the rating will increase after more plays with more people, will have to wait and see. Update: Fantastic game with four people, tension is very high. Won our second game with 2 seconds left on the clock, everyone cheered and it was just high fives all around.

+ Simple rules but not easy to play well
+ Lots of fun in 10 minutes
+ Cool theme (and feels thematic as well)
+ Setup is rather quick

- In this real-time game, you have to do everything quickly, including upkeep, which makes it feel a bit like a dexterity game
- With 1-2 players it can be devastatingly hard when dice are not co-operating

We enjoy this more than Escape for dice-chucking frenzy, but it is a difficult game to figure out how to beat. The best part of cooperative games is working with each other, but to beat this game, you kind of have to just do your thing and hope it works out for everyone. Literally, that's how we ended up beating it for the first time. That's still fun, but it's not as great a feeling as beating a cooperative game that's puzzly, like Pandemic.

Such a unique and fun real time dice game! It's super quick and easy to learn. Such tension and excitement for such a short game. 

This is the perfect game as a starter or to get people to wake up during a long game night.

The artwork and graphic design of the game is good, dice are pretty nice, dice bag is excellent, game app is okay. As a big fan of dice game, short filler and thematic type of games, I'm a very happy and proud owner of this game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this cooperative dice game where everyone is frantically trying to solve fuse cards using the dice available. If a die goes unclaimed, it is re-rolled and everyone loses one die of that color or number from an incomplete fuse card. Must finish in 10 minutes. Frantic fun!

Fun, but too frustrating. Cannot win after multiple attempts at training mission. Random cards in deck so it's possible to get lots of difficult bombs, so mission difficulty cannot just be measured by number of bombs to diffuse. Also, it's easy to get locked and then end up reversing progress with die loss for rerolls. I don't like that aspect of the game at all. And some forget to lose the die because they are so focused on other things. At that point more players get involved in trying to track who should be sacrificing what and it just bogs everything down. We only want to play this again with house rules.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  I originally got this game to play solo, but it's actually a hit for my family.  It's a timed, 10-minute dice game where you must "defuse" bombs by placing specific combos of dice on the cards in play.  It's fast and frantic...obviously.  Playing solo works just fine, but after playing with the family, it certainly lacks that fun, chaotic nature of needing to communicate with others under the pressure of the time constraint.  Very solid family game, if you don't mind the timer, and a decent solo game to boot.

LOVE this game! I am a fan of real time games, but this one is the best. Escape is a fun game because of the total chaos, this game has the same pressure but at a more deliberate pase. The need for cooperation works great. There is little time, but with more and more plays you develop ways to quickly decide which die everybody takes. The game is challenging at first, but doable after repeated plays. I like the solo variant, works great too. The components are great and the app works great, it adds flavour to the game for sure. This game is very addicting. If you start the evening with juat one game you might end up playing ten in a row. Don't tell me I didn't warn you...

Pretty good dice-chucking co-op game that plays really quick.  I like the selection of bomb cards that are included.  However, this game is rather difficult.  I have no idea how you could consistently win anything beyond the first couple of difficulty levels.  Now, I've only played it with 2 and 3 players, and I think it gets easier with more players.  So, 4 players may make it more tenable.

Did I say I liked dice? After one game of this, I may just change my mind. Ten minutes have never gone by so fast! Maybe it'll be better once I memorize what each die icon means? Or once I wrap my head around what to do with unused dice? Or just not using the official timer app with the annoying soundtrack? I'm rating this a 5 not because I think this game is average - it's actually quite clever - but because I'm realizing I don't like real-time games; they stress me out.

EDIT 1.1.18: Played this with GB and realized I like this game infinitely better co-op than solo. Raised rating from 5 to 6.5 because of this. Need more plays to see if this rank will change again.

RATING: 4
This is a quick and harmless game. At only ten minutes, it's hard to criticize, and there are a few things you have to learn in order to succeed at this game. (It also helps to have more players.) That said, our enjoyment of it is limited, and we'll probably move on after ten plays, a total of around two hours. I'd play it again if someone had it on hand--after all, what's another ten minutes?--but I can't say I enjoy it a whole lot. If you're into frenetic real-time games, you might find this one a solid entry in your collection.

another great co-op... this one is frantic and tense and fun... we are trying to disarm a lot of Bombs that are armed to explode in 10 minutes in our Space Ship and if we can't disarm them we all die!!

Real time. Ten minutes. Dice chucking to solve bomb puzzles. Adjustable difficulty (although it's fairly challenging at its base level). Great group game, requiring everyone to work together to make the best use of each roll. Because of that, though, it's vulnerable to the alpha gamer. So, pick your group wisely. There's a nice little app that counts down your time and makes you feel "rushed" to solve all the bomb puzzles, which adds some good flavor.

Video review - https://youtu.be/SG7YnPAUMYQ

Real time co-op dice game with a mechanic similar to roll for it/Age of War/Elder sign. However you have the added pressure of a 10 minute timer! You roll a certain amount of dice, depending on player count and then each take a dice to place on one of your bomb cards, fulfil the dice requirement on the card and you diffuse it and may attempt another one. This works well with 1-5 players although can be difficult with the full 5. Highly recommended.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Real-time co-op/solo puzzle. Very intense as you roll dice and hope you can use them to defuse bombs or else you suffer further. This game is all about adrenalin rush and most likely dying with a (hopefully decent) score rather than winning that often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just 1 play, interesting, but very tough with 2 players.  I believe 4 players would be best.  The other good thing is that I can think of several ways (beyond those in the rule book) of simplifying the game.
1) Stacks mode with only Level 1-3 cards.
2) Stacks mode with only Level 1-3 cards.  Each player gets 3-4 cards in front of them.
3) Unused dice DON'T get rerolled and DON'T hurt you.  Don't use FUSE cards.
4) Unused dice DON'T get rerolled and DON'T hurt you.
5) Unused dice DON'T get rerolled, use value OR color for damage (choose one).
6) Unused dice DON'T get rerolled, use current color AND value for damage.

Do not - I repeat - DO NOT play this with people that don't really get into games. Not if you want to win anyhow. To the game's credit, it has had no problem sucking all of my friend in, even those that are less into board games. There's something about a real-time clock that just gets most people in the spirit.  On the other hand it was everything I could do to not take over for my mother when I tried to get her to play, but I sort of expected it to go that way when I invited her. Still nobody that I've shared this with has been disappointed.

Wow, the tension is huge, even in a solo game, and the ease of entry plus quick thinking required make this a slam dunk. Only quibble is with component quality. Cards seem a bit flimsy. I'll be sleeving it anyway, though. Thus one will get some play.

Fun, quick dice game.  The puzzles are not challenging per se, but the teamwork combined with the time crunch force quick decisions that may not always work out in your favor.  The game comes with several levels of difficulty to ramp up the tension if the game gets too easy after a while.  FUSE comes in a small box and does not overstay its welcome at the table, so it should be safe to stick around in my collection for a good while.

Fun real-time co-op game. You have ten minutes to defuse a given number of bomb cards by placing dice on them according to various patterns on each card - for example, all dice must be the same color, make a stack of five dice of which the middle is a yellow 1, the sum of two dice must equal a third die, etc. Really easy to learn, a bit puzzly, with nice components.

The stress and unclear symbols annoyed me as the timer clicked down. Part of this is that I dislike/hate most/all timed games, but the other reason is this felt very random, just rolling and hoping.

This real-time co-op's simple rules don't get in the way of the task at hand, which is really what you want in a game that requires players to thrive under time pressure. The theme comes through, despite the simplicity of play, and it's so brief that you're likely to want to try again.

RATING: N/A
FUSE is the definition of a dice chucker. I mean technically a game of FUSE cannot last more than 10 minutes, which is an absolute lie, because when you finish a game, you want to play again, and again, and in the end you realise you played a 10 minute game for hours. Chucking those dice on a dice tray, just one stack after another is the most satisfying feeling ever. Absolute pure fun! That being said, the dice tray is a must! Especially with a crowded small table like mine, having a confined place to throw those dice as freely as I want is crucial to the experience. The game is full of tension, once you think you got it in the pocket, you go soft, and BAM you are way behind just like that. You get excited, you get stressed, you become happy, you start sweating. All in a 10 minute time frame. This game is amazing!

After playing this quite a few times I can safely say it still has the tension and excitement as it did in the beginning, unless you play it over and over again with the same people. I love introducing new people to gaming with this one because it's fast, so when they don't want to play games you can say that it only lasts 10 minutes and they comply. New players tend to take their time while making decisions so it also adds even more tension to the game. I stopped playing it solo despite having not defeated it in really high difficulties, just because it got a bit repetitive and I feel like I am missing out on some aspects of the game that come with player interaction.

10 minutes before the bomb explode. This is a high pace thrilled dice game. Yes, there is some luck of the dice, but it is still a lot of fun and very challenging to complete in time.

RATING: 8
What a great, intense way to start the day! A manic, dice-rolling game where players try and complete ("defuse") as many cards ("bombs") in the deck, hopefully, getting through all of them. You only have ten minutes so teamwork, communication and fast-thinking are a must! I would recommend designating people to be the dice-roller and the card-manager to get your process in place. You'll want to play a couple times and the first time will be your trial run and the second will be your first "real" game. Great fun and I love the cooperative aspect.

It is hard to see how you could defuse all the bombs in ten minutes.  Instead, I time how long it takes me to defuse the bombs when playing solitaire, comparing times between games.

This game is a lot of fun when the bomb distribution doesn't screw you over and utterly miserable when it does.  Fortunately it only lasts ten minutes, so it's hard to stay angry at a dud draw, and the frantic nature makes even cruddy layouts feel at least somewhat dynamic.

RATING: N/A
Players race against a 10-minute timer to roll dice that meet the criteria (number/colour) needed to defuse bombs. Problem is, there are around 20 to defuse in the time available. This makes for quite a frenetic filler. Game is playable as a solitaire (and probably works best as one). There is a dedicated app. providing a countdown timer and scoresheet.

Holy wow! This is intense! In Fuse, players work together to defuse a whole stack of bombs (because 1 clearly isn't enough!) as quickly as possible in only 10 impossibly short minutes. I've played this now as a solo game and with 2 players and both are exciting, intense, and immensely fun. Gameplay consists of very simple mechanisms - roll the dice, place whatever you can wherever you can put it following simple rules that change from one bomb to another, and destroy part of your work if you make a(n inevitable) mistake!

Fuse is a real-time co-op dice-roller which I enjoyed a lot more than Escape. It eliminates the frantic re-rolling and instead asks the players to make a quick collective decision after each roll.

RATING: 6
An ok real-time game. A lot of the focus on playing quickly comes down to uninteresting physical efficiency, like "How do we pass the dice bag as quickly as possible and draw the exact number of dice we need as quickly as possible?". I don't find that very fun or satisfying. The bombs themselves have nice variety, and I like the fast, tense discussion each round as you try to figure out how to efficiently divide up the dice that were rolled. Unfortunately, it lacks the heightened tension of a game like Escape Curse of the Temple and doesn't really do anything new or particularly interesting.

A perfect lunch game for me.  It being limited to 10 minutes means there's always time for a round or two.  You can definitely improve with practice and time.  I could see after playing with the same players multiple times everyone getting better at it, better at choosing the right cards for whatever situation they're in, as well as actually helping select other people's dice based on possibilities that were not observed or based on the probabilities .  I really hope this gets an expansion!.

A fun, timed and cooperative dice rolling game. It's fun because you all have to think a little bit about what you need and you're definitely working together under pressure. We came close to winning on our first try, so I wonder how the game ramps its difficulty, other than just shortening the time.

UPDATE: I do really enjoy the interactive part of working together as a team to identify what you need and then get it. It makes for some fast and furious negotiations. With 5 players, we were able to take out Elite. I think Insane is a nice challenge and can be done, although clearing all of the cards seems nigh impossible.

Just like Escape the Temple, this is another game that is actually STRESS packaged in a lovely, artistic box. I don't know why I like this game; it's not like I don't have enough stress in my life. You have to diffuse bombs by collecting the dice you need for your particular bombs. Not stressful enough? Add the annoying countdown timer from the app (very well done, btw) and then you start to feel the pressure. And you don't have to diffuse just one bomb, it's more like 20, 30...you'll swear it feels like a hundred when you're playing.

RATING: 6
Solo play is interesting and more of a ten-minute mental workout than a game. It's fine when you need a quick break from your work in the same way that doing the Jumble or crossword is (except with bone-rolling). Quality dice and bag. Card stock is only so-so, and the blues and blacks on the cards are extremely hard to tell apart which is made worse with the time limit. The free app works great on both Android and iPhone, and adds fun to the game. I like how it has two modes (one more serious and one more silly). It even tallies and saves  your scores. Would love to see every game have a free app with scoring (and rules) built-in.

Have only played solo and may be the only way I get to play it.  I don't mind with this one, though, as it's probably my favorite game to play solo.  I don't think quick on my feet so I'm not very good, but maybe this will help me improve in that regard, help me learn to be less AP prone?  Probably not but it's fun anyway.

Co-op dice-rolling game by Kane Klenko.  The companion mobile application has a snarky timer voice that adds a lot of ambience to the game.  The great thing is that the game will never last more than 10 minutes.  Great for between big games, good filler, deterity, pattern-recognition game.

This is a co-op game where you have 10 minutes to defuse all of the bombs.  Bombs are represented by cards.  To disarm a bomb, you must roll dice and place the appropriate dice, sometimes in a particular order on the spaces on the card.  What you need to place may be a particular die roll or colour of the die.  The game comes with dice in 5 different colours.  Each turn, you reach into a bag and draw the number of dice equal to the number of players and roll them.  Then each player chooses one of the dice rolled to place on his or her card.  Once the proper dice are placed on a card, the bomb card is considered disarmed.  Then you grab a new bomb card.  You have 10 minutes to disarm all of the bomb cards, so you have to roll the dice quickly and make your decisions quickly.

tl;dr: fun challenge

This is a real time co-op game. Not my favorite genre. At all.
Dice are rolled, and each player grabs one of them and tries to play them on one of their cards, matching that card's requirements (certain colors, values, orders...) Dice that can't be used are bad news as it might lead to dice loss for all players. What you're trying to do is complete enough cards before time runs out.
There also are some random cards that hurt all players, but there's a fixed amount of those so once you run out you'll feel relief.
We had to play 3 or 4 games to squeeze out a victory. You get a score regardless, but making it to the end means you'll score a significant amount of bonus points.
This game is quite light and chaotic, but I think it's a fun challenge and the strict time limit makes sure the game doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Frantic but very fun game of cooperative dice selection where you need to solve puzzles on the fly in a 10 minute time frame.  Very few rules and easy to get to the table.

RATING: 6
Loved the concept and theme, and the app is really good. However the rule where *everyone* puts a die back if someone isn't able to use a die really put us off. We house ruled that just a single person had to put a die back which helped with the game still being challenging. Didn't end up getting played too much so sold it on.

Includes Fuse: Wild Die... This is a really fun game. I love it. Couldn't rate it a 10 though because it can be very random and very difficult. With one group, we lost our first game and won the next two, but with a second group, lost 3 times. This game will not work with someone who takes a long time to think and can't communicate. However, that's part of the fun of the game! Frantic communication and making the right decision quickly :) This is a wonderful frenetic mess :)

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3+[/b]
With two players, you each choose two dice which causes a few issues. There are some weird timing issues that can happen, but more importantly the difficulty is much higher. This is because there are fewer cards where you can place your dice than at higher player counts. It feels like the two-player version was tacked-on.

Do you want a quick dice-fest with a timer that has you frantically grabbing dice, yelling at your friends not to take the blue one?  Do you hear the timer app say "1 minute remaining" and raise your voices even more while grabbing and rolling dice only to find that Jim can't use that die and now we have to discard that color or number from your almost complete bomb?  Do you really want that stress and yelling in a 10 minute easy-to-play game?  Do you think your friends are actually going to suggest playing again after blowing up!?
Yes, I like this game and yes, we nearly always play a 2nd time.  Great game.

:star: cool, underutilized theme

:nostar: real-time applies a kind of pressure I'm not always in the mood for
:nostar: with 2 players, there are too many moments when you can't use any of the dice, and the punishment for that is too severe given how often it happens

FUSE or Escape, FUSE or Escape?

Hard to tell. I still like both of them for different reasons.

Fuse feels a little bit more thinky, while Escape is more of a 'roll fast' game.

This is a hard game, way more than Escape(which needs expansions to be challenging).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
FUSE was a surprise hit of GenCon 2016. A friend and I were wandering past the Renegade booth when we were asked to demo a game. We both had a blast (get it?!) and it turned out it was the designer, Kane, who was teaching us his game. Cool stuff!

FUSE scales very well between 2 and 5 players, truly plays in the 10 minutes printed on the box, and the setup and teardown are very quick. 

It's more of a brain burner at 2, and more of a shouting, frantic mess at 5. Either way, it's a fun, quick, cooperative filler.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=171273][/thing] is a real time cooperative game. The main mechanism is simple: one d6 is rolled per player. Dice have different colors. The goal is to use the dice to fulfill demands on the cards (bombs) each player has in front of them (each person have two). When a die can't be placed, as the cards have many restrictions, it "blows" - the die is rolled again, and every player loses one die: either one that matches the color or one that has shows the same number - only die that are the top of things are affected (as some cards demand that a tower of dice is built, and only the dice at the top can be affected). Players have 10 minutes to empty the draw deck, thus winning; otherwise, players lose.

The negatives points of [thing=171273][/thing] are: the real time aspect (many people don't like the chaos and stress); the luck, present in the roll of the dice and in drawing them from the bag, as well as in the order that the cards show up; the fact that there is little true cooperation between players, staying more in line of asking for some kind of dice or saying that you can have X or Y die; and, finally, the worst is that the game doesn't escales well: it is too easy with 5 players and too difficult (and luck dependent) with 2 or 3 - it is simple because more dice being rolled, with more options to place them, make for less challenge.

The positives are: the real time basically prevents the alpha player syndrome - there is hardly time, during all the shouting and chaos, to get what you need, let alone controlling what others need or do. And the effective fun of wishing for results and having the pressure of time pushing everyone to get things done.

The lists above might lead one to think that [thing=171273][/thing] was more on the "bad" side, but no: I enjoy all my plays. [thing=171273][/thing] is simple and agile: there aren't many rules, it is quick to teach and to learn, and is very clear what one needs - players aren't confused, without knowing what to do. Then everyone have fun, which is the most important feature of a game, for me. Therefore, I liked it and recommend it.

Very fun, pulls you right in.  One of a few games I've found that I legitimately enjoy playing by myself as much as with others.  Perhaps even more so as a solo.  I can't imagine any of my friends not enjoying this, and of course the built in game length is very appealing when you can't commit to something long or you want to spark a non-gamer's interest with something fast and furious.

I play it with my kids without the timer and they love matching up the dice.  Will graduate to timer use once they have learned the cards/rules thoroughly.

FUSE is an incredible game of teamwork and suspense! I love playing this at the beginning of a game night to get everyone in the mood. The app is a really clever way to keep track of the timer and the score. The snarky voice over is perfect! If you haven't played this, you're missing out!

Don't let the name fool you. This is not a bomb squad simulation. It's an abstract game where the players take turns rolling dice and then distributing them to each other in order to complete recipes of specific die colors and values before a timer runs out. It certainly could get frantic enough to feel like diffusing a bomb, but there isn't much correlation between the moving quickly and any kind of a sense of dread, like you get in other games like Space Alert.

It's fine, with a capital F, as in I don't really care if I ever play it again.

Family real time cooperative dice game.  Replicate dice colors and values diagrammed on the bomb cards. Bomb patterns have random difficulty.  Share from the community rolled dice pool to complete a number of cards before time expires. Unused dice will cause players to lose placed dice and precious time. This is the most important part of working together. The game should have a startling end event like the game perfection to add a little more to the thrill and panic to detonation.

Amazing cooperative filler, that works excellent on a solo mode.

Co-operative Dice frenzy in ten minutes. Diffuse the BOMBS!!!! But for real, it's fun. Grab dice, roll dice, allocate one to each player to use on their bombs to defuse them. The app is great, very thematic and humorous. This game is the perfect solution if you're itching for a co-op but most of the other players might not be or are unsure. It's hard to argue ten minutes.

I have only played with up to two players, since my best friend and my wife both hate real-time, intense games. It's a GREAT solo and two-player experience, though. There's at least some strategy despite your reliance on dice; you can mitigate the effects of bad rolling by choosing some difficult cards along with some easier ones. Download the app for the full experience.

I usually don't like real-time games, but this one is a decent one. You feel the anxiety of having to place the dice as soon as possible, but you are not upset if you lose: you just try again.

My first attempt at a real-time game. It can be quite fun and tense. But the majority of the time you're just stuck waiting for the right value and/or number dice to be rolled and you can't do anything about it.

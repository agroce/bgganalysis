Both original Metagaming version and Designer's Edition.

Played and enjoyed the original over 30 years ago, and now, as an over-the-top spoiling, because I can, have just got the new Deluxe Designer's Edition. The sheer size and weight really surprised me when I picked it up. Good thing it is a rainy day today, as I can play with and assemble some of the massive contents.

This is a good, quick game. The Designer's edition is extravagant for the gameplay, but what the heck, it's full immersion. It is great value for money on a weight/dollar ratio.

[Pocket edition] This game is built around a simple idea (big daddy machine is coming down to destroy you and you have to defend as best as you can) but it delivers on the excitement camp every time. There are a number of different Ogres you can use for different flavour but whatever you use the balance will always be severely tilted against you and this is kind of cool as the game tends to be hard but sometimes a number of lucky dice rolls will turn some units in heroes and make it very interesting to the very end. In some other games the Ogre simply destroys everything in its path and nothing works or stops it. But these are also enjoyable for me, the sense of helplessness and theme that comes out of this game is unique. This a very luck based game but it is quick and easy to setup and play and it offers plenty of thrills.

Microgame by Steve Jackson games. The first wargame I owned and one of my favourites. An attack by a multi-weaponed cybernetic supertank (the Ogre) against a (user-selected) conventional force protecting a command post. Play is rapid, with the Ogre attempting to wipe out the command post and escape, and the defending force struggling to stop it. On the conventional player's side, armour unit selection can give a slightly different tactical flavour (and mean the difference between success and failure). In the original 1977 version, there are a basic and an advanced scenario based around two different Ogres and a smaller or larger conventional force. Who wouldn't want to play the Ogre?

The concept of "quality vs. quantity" taken to the nth degree.  It started off as one of as the first offerings of [company=356][/company], and it fits the format: easy, small, sci-fi/fantasy-themed, clever concept, pulled off well.  It is still pretty fun, but shows its age.

RATING: 3.4
:cry: :) Played two games at Arisia, one as defender and one as Ogre Mark III. Not sure if we had imbalanced dice or what, but defender could not roll a 6. Literally, for the first two hours, the blue die NEVER rolled a 6, regardless of who used it. I actually curb-stomped the other guy playing as the Ogre, because its weapons seem to just destroy EVERYTHING. My friend talked it up but it felt like a big disappointment -- even if the dice hadn't been unbalanced, the Ogre seems utterly unstoppable. Good game if you like exercises in futility, but I'll probably pass on this in the future.

If you're local (or within reasonable driving distance) I may be willing to sell it or trade it. GeekMail me first for details, as it has been opened! I can provide photos if needed.

It should have all the parts plus extras of things I got through the Kickstarter. I have not picked up any extra new maps, parts, or other items for it since the Kickstarter.

Here's how to play it NOW without taking your time & cash to get it: 2 players, each with a sheet of paper & a pencil. The "Ogre" has 100 hit-points before losing. The Opponent has 100 units to attack with. The Ogre rolls one die, with each pip a loss off the Opponent's original 100. The Opponent rolls as many dice as he has units (that's almost as many dice as you'd roll in "Titan", but let me restrain myself to just one game) - for every 6 he rolls, the Ogre loses a hit point. Keep rolling until one player is out of points. AWESOME!

It wasn't as complicated as I had feared (for being an old-school war game) and I had a good time playing it, although we did get an important rule regarding the Ogre trends. I would definitely want to try this again.

Never got a copy through the years - was interested and heard some good things (particularly with the addition of GEV) but was unsure about the asymmetrical nature of the forces so didn't take the plunge. Great to see the $5 budget option to grab the game, particularly in a time of high price shiny Euros it's good to be able to buy the essence of a good game without being required to pay for the bling. Reminds me of the paper envelope Cheap Ass games - you buy the rules and paper/card copies of the unique components and board but generic parts (dice, counters/pawns etc) to be supplied by you. Sure, it's nice to have pretty components but it's the design that's the important part. Some new games  suffer form over function problems with design making components hard to use or read - sometimes black text on white background can make text-heavy components much easier to use and time spent trying to read cards etc can be better spent actually playing the game. Likewise a flat cardboard piece (chit) can have names/stats/pictures printed on it providing for greater variety of units than the colour and shape of meeples.

Initial Impression: When a game claims "Collector's Edition" or "Designer's Edition", one assumes the most complete edition, with the highest quality of components. This edition of Ogre does not disappoint. Everything from the thick maps, huge counters, and 3D buildings ooze quality. And the Ogres themselves? Don't get me started. This game commands attention when it graces the table. The game itself is a very basic, almost introductory, tactical wargame with the option to add rules and levels of complexity in order to tweak to different experience levels. The sheer amount of units and maps, coupled with the simple army point system make this a very replayable wargame. It has my son's attention so I have high hopes that this will be the one that turns him into a wargamer.

I funded the Kickstarter to get one of the 26 pound designer editions. Since, my gaming group has had a great time with it provided the place we go has a play area large enough to support it. SJGames website has tons of supporting materials to allow for lots of variations. It says 1-3 players, best with 2, but I've played games with assigned units/ogres that allowed 8 to play. Its easy to modify to allow more players.

For some reason, it's great fun desparately trying to stop the ogre by throwing everything you have at it before it uses it's nuclear treads to crush your HQ.  As the Ogre, its amazing to destory an entire army with one unit.  How can you beat this game for $3 (original price point)?  Replay was weaker than most game and the compnents were pretty sub par, but what can you expect for $3?  Still a very playable game.  Missing counters for my copy!

The shadow of this old Microgrames  classic looms perhaps a little larger than the game itself. Among the very lightest of wargames, OGRE yet compares favorably with the likes of Panzer Leader and PanzerBlitz, which it emulates a bit. But the stakes are higher with heavy tanks, GEVs (a kind of hovercraft), and the monstrous, multi-tracked, -turreted, and -missiled OGRE. Smash the defending HQ or the OGRE. That's the game! Further expansion sets introduced miniatures and opportunities for scenario creation. A quick and fun little game that has served Steve Jackson extremely well

Update 12-06-13: Yes, I purchased the monster-gonzo-footlocker edition of OGRE! I'm almost afraid to break it out and put it together, wondering if all the pieces will fit in the trunk or not. Yet I'm consumed with curiosity to see all the pieces in their laser-cut 3-D glory!

I've played this game in various incarnations, and have generally enjoyed it. The Ogre is still over-powered at my level of the learning curve, but that just makes it easy to handicap the game: the weaker player gets the Ogre, and go to town. I like the concept (single super-unit vs. swarm) and fluff (even the PBI have shoulder nukes). While I've purchased the supplements and minis, I've still only played the original "Ogre Classic", and I don't feel it's worn out its welcome yet.

I bought this on a whim. Having played it twice (once with Ogre, once with GEV), I just don't really see the appeal. Playing with just one Ogre on a side is, frankly, boring. And once you introduce multiple units per side, there are way better tactical battle games out there. Plus, the massive box only fits under Andrew's bed.

The kids split a corner on the lid so I'll have a tough time unloading this. We'll keep it if Andrew likes it, but there are LOTS of other wargames I'd rather play.

It's so nice of them that they (re-)released this pocket edition of Ogre. I haven't had played it before and would have never bought the (huge and expensive) designer's edition without knowing it, but this was an insta-buy.

Games don't need fancy components to be fun, and this is a good 2-player skirmish game.

Ohkay...well...as a short little skirmish game? Ok.
As the $2.99 version for your pocket? Great.
Maybe I would say something else if I had the Designer's Edition but... well it is a simple game.
Good to pass a few minutes but that's it.

Pre-ordered the game today.  The postage is much more than the game itself (115% of the game price).  Since no kickstarter option available for Hong Kong, I've to order the game with extra payment for the shippment and no kickstarter bonus.

Hope Car Wars kickstarter will have option for Hong Kong people.

A fun, light wargame that has lots of sentimental value to me. This was one of my earlier purchases as a very young gamer. I'm fairly certain it was the first game I owned that contained a hex map, because I remember being fascinated by it. The version I purchased came in a little black plastic snap-lid container that had a VERY distinctive smell. Decades later, when I open the box again, it still has the same smell. My mind reels from the sudden rush of early gaming memories it brings back.

An outstandingly asymmetric mini wargame which got a lot of play at the time - so many tiny cardboard counters crushed under the orge's tracks over the years in an often futile attempt to delay or halt the inexorable destruction.  A Classic.

Having never played Ogre before I do enjoy the Designer's edition.  The game is pretty simple though, and 60% of my entertainment comes from how obscenely grandiose this version is. At the same, this much Ogre is truly unbearable and difficult to store. It's a Catch-22 situation that is difficult to live with.

O Nostalgia!  I had two versions of this in the 70s... I asked my father to write a check for me to buy it. So I showed him an advertising letter from "Microgaming Concepts", the old company name, which they wrote me in response to my request for Triplanetary, which they no longer carried. The letter misspelled Ogre as "Orge".  My dad raised his eyebrows...   I like Ogre but thought I figured out a dependable defensive strategy that would just barely destroy the Ogre.  I enjoyed the various sequels and advancements. GEV was tactically evocative.  I liked the stronger and weaker Ogre types a lot.   The armored train was cool too.  I'm more interested in operational and strategic wargames now.

Asymmetric games are fun!

Owned: pocket edition. The game is really fun and plays in a surprisingly short period of time. The first game I played, I was the defense and wanting to set it up quickly so as not to bore my opponent with overthinking my unit placement, I foolishly placed all my infantry closest to the Ogre, ensuring my easy defeat as they were absolutely dominated by the Ogre's AP weapons. Next time, for sure!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A classic hex and counter game that I wish I played more often. It does play well solo due to the fact that there is limited secret information.  I have several versions, but never got the miniature set which looked awesome.  A great science fiction wargame that is even better combined with GEV.

Steve Jackson Games.  Neat futuristic game.  It's the super large, sophisticated tank against army men armed with hover craft, heavy tanks and missile batteries and howitzers.  The game is sort of a capture the flag with the Ogre tank taking on everything else and trying to destroy the command post of the enemy.  Fun, fast paced game which plays well.  Rules aren't very deep and the game plays in less than an hour.  It is a 1:1 light war game.  Lots of ways to mix up the combat forces for replayability.

RATING: 6
It's cheap and the cover is amazing.  The deluxe version is far more cool but who has $300 for it?  This version is $1.99 and playable.  Makes a great stocking stuffer but at the end of the day it's super complex and not very visually compelling, aside from the spectacular cover art which might just be worth the $1.99 on it's own.  People pay more than that for a hallmark card, and this definitely gets my vote for that sort of application.  Almost anyone would prefer this to a hallmark card.  Happy Holidays grandmas everywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Still lots of fun after all these years.  This is a simple game to learn and an interesting game to play which is over in under an hour.  Also lots of bang for your bucks (big deal if you have to cut the counters out yourself).  If you like this, you should definitely get GEV which ads tons of variety in units, topography and scenarios, without much more complexity.

The pocket edition holds a A4 paper map with very plain graphics for terrain and lots of counters to play any variant or Ogre scenario. The rules are very simple with no ambiguities and one can start to play the game almost immediately. The defender holds a Command Post, a variety of troops and armor trying to protect it from a vicious technologically advanced military machine called the OGRE – just one unit. The mechanics of play are so plain that there is no much thought for tactics. Actually it is a dice duel; the luckier one gets to be the winner. A small light game to kill pleasantly your hour. For such a low price the game contains actually more than one can hope for.

I can't really offer a score for this magnificent box or its myriad contents, as I never got to play a game of it.

Frankly, I picked it up off the appeal of the massive-scale 1v1 conbat - the theme of 'massive army versus one massive tank' is hard to resist. Unfortunately, I can never justify breaking it out - there's too many other 2 player games I would choose to play sooner.

An old favorite made even better by the Deluxe Ogre minis version. Fast and easy to learn, hard on the defenders. This is the game that weaned a lot of people on to wargames (myself included) in the late 70's/early 80's. Still a great game, if only for the fact that it requires lots of tense, tough decisions and is playable in under an hour.

I have been playing this game for years.  It is the game I use to get my family and friends into playing wargames. Not everyone was ready to jump into Panzer Leader or Firefight or Sniper (Yes I am dating myself). I can have a non player up and playing in 15 minutes, and have them hooked.  It is what I use now to get my card collecting Magic The Gathering friends away from a table and onto a board. I will buy this game and give it away to make friends believers of tanks and infantry.

Not a game I would run out and buy but the Pocket Edition is cheap enough that it's a decent little game to play and see how far we've come.

From the Pocket Edition I can tell you Ogre is a very simple, asymmetric war-game.  While units in the game have attack ranges there are no line-of-sight rules, ergo, everything is visible from everywhere and while you can use inaccessible hexes to 'effectively' block line-of-sight.  It makes Ogre feel a little lacking compared to if the battle was held in a canyon where there are walls and true cover.

Still, good on Steve Jackson; he has come a long way from making games on a printed piece of paper in a zip-lock bag with a few card chits and has done big things for the hobby.  For a few bucks you can't go wrong, it's either a game you will like or an ‘ok’ game with a history lesson attached.  It is by no means a bad or broken game.

Probably one of the few mini-games published from the 1970s that people still talk about with fondness today. Anyone who used to play Ogre still remembers it and many I speak with say they would like to play again. You cannot say that about many game published in the 1970s and 80s. Games come and go, memories fade, but Ogre goes on and on. Ogre still has a lot of potential as a game. I just wish I had more time to play.

Well this comment is more about the components in the designer edition, which are amazing.

The game itself is a fairly simple wargame at heart; some basic terrain modifications (only in GEV maps, really), move, roll dice, and try to fudge the CRT odds to the next column over!

It's an old design, but it's still very solid.  None of these silly cards or blocks!  Just roll dice and kill stuff.

This was a bonus that came with the Kickstarter edition at a certain backer level. It's a replica of the original baggy release of Ogre. If you understand that, then it's a pretty neat version to have. However, on its own merits, I rate it a 6.

Superb presentation, packaging, artwork, and component quality. I haven't played this new edition of the game yet though, so I'm not rating it yet. However, it looks like they haven't really modified the underlying game much at all with this release so I anticipate giving it a 6 or so. It's fun, a great gateway wargame, and open to a huge variety of missions and scenarios, but it is very simple.

I bought this many many years ago as a young teenager and sadly never appreciated what type of door I was looking at - so never opened the gaming door until recently  That said, a reason was possibly that the game consists of small bits of paper that you cut up and move on another piece of paper, so in terms of presentation it all looked quite pathetic . Yet to be played, and probably only if and when they release a 'nice bits' version (16/12/08).  UPDATE: I am not going to play this in paper version - archived (19/7/11). UPDATE I still wait for decent version of this game (Rating 4.623 Jan 17)

RATING: 7
I didn't even know he was releasing this in stores, so it was a nice surprise to be able to buy this. And only $2.95? (The original 1977 price). That is such a cool gesture to get this game into the hands of everyone!  Die rolls reign supreme, but Ogre is the cutest game I know that deals in apocalyptic firepower and overwhelming odds. For the amount of luck in this game, there's also a solid amount of tactical push that makes this game better than what it should be. I'm sure it's fine two-player (though the Ogre could be a bit boring) but solo actually works pretty well, as the Ogre's move are pretty patterned. Old-school pocket-sized wargame that still has relevance today. Cool!

The game I use to teach people to not fear paper and counter wargames.  Simple, fun, and I still think up new battles and play it after owning it since 1990!

Good light wargame. Goddamn obnoxious size.

It's actually prohibitively big, and I can't even open it without finding a surface to hold the empty lid + garages + maps, while I dig out the morass of counters.

I'll probably end up playing the pocket version much more often.

First world problem (and symptom), I suppose.  I do feel like I need to get this monster to the table much more often. The GEV scenarios with spillover and overrun are quite fun and relatively fast to set up, as long as I bring out an extra table.

Kickstarter 100 level.  Owned it briefly (got my name on the box as a kickstarter at least).  It is simply too big for what it is and the artwork and approach just wasn't my style (as with most SJG products). Ogres with arms, garish maps and hexes too small for units to fit within their confines turned me off.  Yes, I got a lot of stuff for $100, but I let it go.  I will probably pick up the forthcoming pocket edition or just go with minis.

Although Ogre shows its age in many ways (a hex-based map, movement allowances, attack/defense factors, range, etc.), it remains remarkably relevant even today. Many old-school wargames are appreciated best when viewed nostalgically, but Ogre holds up well as a game you actually want to play for its own sake. For those interested in seeing what a hex-and-counter wargame is all about, Ogre is an ideal introduction.

So I played the huge box version of this game after not playing it for years, and it was ok.  Not really wowed of anything.  It was a fine game in its day.  I cant understand why anyone would want the massive box version, or ever take the time to play anything but the basic scenario.  It would take up so much space and take so long to play, just wouldn't seem worth it to me.

If I can't play Firefly until Christmas, then he can't play this until then, either! Just putting together all of the minis and organizing the counters was fun, though. You can't tell to look at him, but I'm pretty sure he's squealing like a little girl who just got a Barbie Dreamhouse on the inside. He doesn't know it, but I got more counter sheets coming. SURPRISE!

Well, we finally got a game, two actually, under our belts. Thanks to the snow day, we pulled out Ogre and gave it a try. I MUST print out organizer tabs and get all of those chits tidied. Trying to find the units you need is not easy. I really like the "garage" for the 3D minis but the chit organizer is not that great. 

Anyway, the first game did not go well. Husband was soundly defeated using a scenario called "Bad Timing". The dice were definitely against him. We then dug through the full rule book and found some additional rules, such as "combining attacks" that helped him enjoy the scenario much better the second time through. The second game also went quicker because we used the free "Combat Calculator" app from sjgames.com. It made the math much easier and the electronic dice rolled better for Husband. We pulled to a draw.

Super inexpensive for its day, extremely playable, and portable, this Micro Game deserves to be in the Hall of Fame, if there ever is one.

Been playing since high school—still playing.  The classic short-on-time science fiction war game.

[b]Notes on the Designer's Edition:[/b]

Literally ridiculous—outsized and excessive in every way possible.

• The box is so large it strains under the stresses of its own mass.

• It should have come with a built-in shunt—this thing box-farts more air than four Olympic swimmers' lungs.  (No, really—I did the math!)

• There are enough boards and counters for 10 (!) individual wargames.

• While the entire kit accounts for storing everything neatly the same cannot be said for the bulk of the box itself.  [i]Where the hell am I supposed to put this thing?[/i]

In the end it is quite a thing to see, breathtaking to experience firsthand—no photograph can contain its raw majesty—and it is simply a wonder, a miracle that this titanic pinnacle of hobby gaming made it from concept to doorstep intact.

(This was my first Kickstarter and I must say I am thoroughly spoiled by SJG's superb handling of the entire process.  While the end result has exceeded all expectations it was the journey that let me know I'd backed the right pony—their communication was constant, clear and honest.)

Contains:

1 set of [gameid=172650]
2 sets of Ogre Dice ([gameid=153258] + Green/Black) 
[gameid=168541]
[gameid=152870]

UPDATE:  Really, [i]really[/i] hate the two-hex bits.  They add nothing to the actual gameplay other than the distracting itch that one must constantly be reminded that THE ASS-END IS ILLUSORY and while the probability cloud of a given OGRE's position might [i]appear[/i] to fill two hexes it really only squats in the front one when its waveform collapses upon observation...

That said, they aren't completely worthless—it's fun to sit the 3D models near their record sheets for the visual impact.  But I am immeasurably glad I picked up the Classic Counters so I have some OGREs that are appropriate for actual play.

RATING: 8
A simple science-fiction hex-and-counter war game that has received a number of treatments over the years, the recent pocket version being the one I own (the dice I bought for it were ironically twice the price of the rest of it). Easy to get into yet still containing a decent amount of detail, it makes for a good intro to the type of games it represents. Fast, fluid, and full of dramatic swings of luck, overall it's quite fun yet is ultimately messy and a bit shallow. Still, I like it for it's theme and the asymmetrical nature of the standard scenario. I also had the honor of playing in a custom-made "massive" scenario at a game convention in 2016, using the Designer's Edition, and that ended up being a lot of fun.

(Rating for Designer's Edition, ie. rating incorporates Ogre, GEV and Shockwave)
I love the pure unrelenting violence of the theme -- nukes everywhere! A little 'primitive' and bears the marks of the iterative design approach, and setup with the huge box is a bit annoying (is pocket GEV out yet?), but it's a lot of fun and flows well once you get the rules down; maneuver and position are very important. This game's older than me and people still play and enjoy it, so it's clearly doing something right.

Kwanchai's version...  (fan creation: same rules, different theme):

[ImageID=563095]
Build detail [b][url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/46525/item/1048535#item1048535]here[/url][/b].

It's a really fun game and flies once you get the rules down. The Ogre can cause mass casualties and is really a challenge to stop...  

I was sold on buying a new "official" version (whenever it comes out), but I really can't stand how harshly [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/529048]SJGames[/url] dealt with this fan creation...  Won't be supporting the company. Ever.

Loved the simple metagaming small one best, good beer and pretzels fun, or lunch break game.  Couldn't get into the GEV and expanded follow ons at all.  Simple and fast was best... ditched it after a while to someone with a fetish for it.

RATING: 7
Classic two player asymmetric wargame.  One player has a whole army of soldiers, tanks, artillery, etc.  The other guys just has the Ogre, a whopping huge nearly unstoppable tank bristling with weaponry.  Makes for a quick, very tense game.  Based, I suspect, on Keith Laumer's bolo books.  Very fun, quite light for a wargame.  Good intro into the genre for someone new to wargames.

Call it "Ogre: Massive Box." It has everything ever created for Ogre to this point in top quality - all in a box that's large and heavy enough to kill a small child. A fantastic number of options BUT, at the heart, it's still a two-player game in which one player works to destroy the single unit of the other.

HUGE PLUS: completeness, number of options
MINUS: two-player only despite the number of pieces

RATING: 6.75
A reprint of the original Steve Jackson game in which one person controls the tank (Ogre) and the other tries to stop it. Has everything you need to play in one ziploc baggie.

Actually underwhelmed by the production.  Yes nice things in regards to the 3D models but there are not as many as thought.  Beyond the 3d models there is just a stack (a giant stack) of chits. Cool for the early 80s but I am not into retro.  The grognards might find paradise but 80s nostalgia lasted a week for me and I immediately sold it.  Nothing wrong with the game; just not my cup of tea anymore.  Oh well at least someone was happy to buy my copy.

The original Steve Jackson classic is a quick asymmetric tactical war game that teaches and plays quickly.  I'm not much of a war gamer, so the minimal nature of OGRE works well for me.  Note that I'm referring to "classic" small box and chits OGRE.  The new designer's edition is a sight to behold and a masterpiece of production excess, but for my purposes the old $3 game does the trick just fine, and I plan to pick up a fresh copy of that version when it becomes available.

I have a long history with this game.  I bought the Steve Jackson Games "pocket box" edition way back when.

This led to various expansions and the companion game, GEV.  Pretty soon I had a rather sprawling game system that didn't easily fit in any of the game packaging.  And while I liked it, the counters were annoyingly small and hard to pick up.  I eventually sold off the lot.  

I then bought the ole Deluxe Ogre boxed game.  This was a nice edition, and one I enjoyed a lot.  In retrospect this may have been my most enjoyed implementation of this game.  

Then I mistakenly decided to get into Ogre miniatures.  Mistake.  Sold all that off.

I backed the giant Ogre designer's edition.  Ugh.  Some poor decisions went into this.

Separately, I bought the unauthorized "Kwanchai" edition of Ogre at a charity auction.  I love it.

For me, the original Ogre game works nicely.  While I like the idea of GEV as an enhanced game, it starts to lose its charm.

I have this game in a few forms.  If you are looking for a trade. drop me a geek mail.

A cheap sic-fi game, similar to a cheap Pokeman or Nintendo as to an expensive powerhorse PC game system.  Suprisingly, the game does work and has distinguished Orge machines with a miniature game feel.  I was introduced to it by a friend and found attracted to the wrecked battlefield.  The game is cool and appeals to those interested in a future robot war.  However, since I am more a historical buff, I soon loose my interest in it. Nonetheless, I can't help my nostalgia in getting Ogre: Pocket Edition in 2013.  After all, it might not be so bad.

Owned the 1978 second edition Metagaming version as a kid. Purchased a copy of the OGRE/G.E.V. 5th edition (printed in 2000) with all the extra expansion goodies a couple of years back. Just picked up the HUGE 6th edition (Designer's Edition - retail version). 

Absolutely fantastic game. The tradtional scenario pits one giant super robotic tank, called an 'Ogre', against a large number of more traditional tanks, missile crawlers, and infantry. The Ogre is 'programmed' to destroy a command post deep in enemy territory, but to get there, it must run a gauntlet of enemy tanks and other weapons. As the defending player, do you try to take out the Ogre's tracks first... slowing its movement? Or do you attack its various bristling gun & missile weapons first? 

There's a great variety of units & scenario types, which makes for some very diverse game play tactics. The provided scenarios are both interesting, diverse, and well balanced, making for some great game moments. The game is easy to get into, and moves at a quick pace. The last few turns of a well balanced game can often be 'nail-biting', as the Ogre chews through enemy armor, inching closer to the enemy command post, as its slowly picked apart by enemy fire. 

Ogre also plays very well as a solitaire game.

For the newest 6th edition titled the 'Designers Edition', my advice is not to pay too much for the 'Kickstarter' version. The retail version already includes some counter sheets that were sponsored by kickstart supporters. There's 38 sheets of counters in the kickstart version and 32 in the retail version - not that big of a difference. I'm glad to have more room in my 'ogre garage' for adding pieces sold by other sponsors of the game, such as the Nightfall sheets.

Asymmetric duel.  The pocket edition is cheap in both its cost and quality, although there is a classic charm to that.  The depth of strategy is shallow, with luck being a determining factor even in situations that have been arranged in your favor.  I recommend downloading the Ogre War Room app for your games.  It automatically calculates your odds, rolls your dice, and tracks your Ogre stats.

It's tiny, but it gets the job done so long as you don't mind the creases in the paper map and manipulating 1/2" counters in close quarters (at least there isn't much stacking). Needs a user-supplied die.

Every time I open this little bag up and thumb through the rules and fiddle with the tiny counters I have the same feeling every time.

First thought: 'This feels so...80's. My cup of tea!'

Second thought: 'Ogres? Why should I care about this strange dystopian world?'. 

And then it gets packed away again...

The backdrop flavour text throws you straight into battle with absolutely no explanation as to why we are fighting. It's all about the rise of the Ogre, which is all well and good, but why did it come about??? The lack of explanation disconnects me from the whole experience. At least in a Terminator futuristic world we know that it's machines against man due to man's folly, but here it doesn't seem to be the case. The Ogres are made by...who exactly? 

I'm sure the game itself is good. I just haven't got over that thematic hurdle yet. Silly, I know. I suppose I should make my own story up really.

How can you beat this classic, simple, yet oh-so-complex game? By making it into a nearly 30 pound box of goodness!

BTW, this is my first game purchased with my own money, waaaay back in 1977.  If I recall, I ordered it by mail, direct from Metagaming, from an ad in the high school library's subscription copy of 'Analog'.

I've had it ever since, and it hits the table (mainly solo now) every few weeks.

Deceptively simple and very addictive. Probably the king of the hill for "most game in the cheapest package" short of a deck of cards or a set of dice - as in, it would take a lot of design to get more than what OGRE has to offer out of less components. Very few have managed it in 4 decades. 
My advice on acquiring this game is to shop around: most sites will happily charge you more for shipping than the game is worth. Find a site with free or good shipping and you actually CAN purchase this game for its advertised price.

Ogre is fantastic -- short, simple, easy to learn and explain, yet not lacking in interesting decisions. There aren't a huge number of variables in the basic game, nor choices to consider during any individual turn, but for a 30-60 minute game with this one's over-the-top premise (which I love) it's note-perfect.

The designer's edition is as amazing as it sounded. I thought I'd be annoyed by the constructable cardboard bits, but they're actually quite cool. The hugeness and quality of the whole thing is pretty amazing.

I can see why Ogre has endured for 30+ years. It's a fun game.

The original microgame.  More fun than many games that cost tons more $$$.  Old components are lacking - fine in the day, but hard for me to play nowadays.

Just purchased, but played it (and liked it) in junior high. Quick, fun, replayable, with a great idea at its core. It's a game that can be played multiple times in a row, and you can play the same scenario back to back with the players switching sides.
Get everything for this game (Ogre, G.E.V., Shockwave, Reinforcements, etc.) and you've got an amazing and flexible game kit that you could probably devote the bulk of your game-playing life to if you wanted.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  This is a neat, very portable (pocket edition) 2P wargame from the old school days.  One player is the Ogre, a massive, super powered, tank-like vehicle with only one thing on its mind...destruction.  The other player has an army of smaller, more mobile military units trying to stop the Ogre before it reaches the objective and blows it to bits.

It's pretty simple to play both sides by yourself as the Ogre is pretty straightforward.  Also, there is a nice, small deck of automated cards for the Ogre in the files section that you can use for making decisions for the Ogre.  That allows you to focus on trying to stop it with your own forces.  It plays out on a typical hex map with mostly easy to follow rules.  It's a great introduction to wargaming on a bigger scale.

Original SJ Games plastic box edition was one of my first wargames. Colourful map graphics that still standup to current standards imo.  Basic b&w silhouette counters contrast nicely against the map.

Lots of carnage and an entertaining game narrative.  Teaches basic tactics.  Enough standard wargame mechanics to give new players a good feel for wargames (to see if they like the genre) and a decent foundation for more complex games.

A wargaming classic that deserves a reissue.

Ogre Designer's Edition (SJG 2013).

Yes, I bought a copy of ODE via Kickstarter.  Yes it was a nostalgia driven purchase.

ODE is well produced and looks fine graphically and the large size maps are suited for use with miniatures.

However, the game is way too large and impractical to store around the house, nevermind lugging the game out to a meetup or what have you.  

If the game came in a physically smaller package, I may have played it several times already.  As it is, I'm thinking of buying separate storage boxes to breakup the components of the game into manageable, carry-able pieces.

If ODE was scaled fit inside one of the old FFG "coffin box" sized games, that would've been an excellent compromise in my opinion.

As it is, my ODE ratings:  game "8", production quality "9", practicality "3".

Not much to add given what's already been written here, there and everywhere. If you like this sort of thing, you're already sold. If you don't, that's ok too. If you're wondering what the hype is all about, if you know three people who regularly play wargames, odds are one of them has it. Whether they're willing to cop to having it, that's a different story.

In any case, there are a lot of copies of ODE floating around, including copies in shrink, at a reasonable price. It really is a massive amount of game for the money.

And seriously, the physical size of this game is fun given you have some place to set it up.

A decent skirmish game. I think in 1977 this would have been pretty groundbreaking. By today's standards, it's a fairly simple war game.

Like Panzer Blitz on acid. I bought the small portable version, probably around 1982. Was very much of that time when DnD was showing up in the movie ET. Saw it at a local con. Gave it a go. Intriguing, but wasn't really my thing bc I was still an Avalon Hill war gamer. This was war gaming, but without a clear point for me. In retrospect I have a lot of admiration for the game, though.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Very light wargame with an insanely huge box that makes it impossible to carry it anywhere, even to store it.

It basically confronts a big OGRE vehicle with many little units, but includes more scenarios with diverse team compositions.

The rules are way simple and accessible to almost anybody. Maybe too simple.

The components (especially the cardboard mounted OGREs) are cool and there are many of them. Actually, in a game you use a very small percentage of the components included.

I'm not a fan of wargames and this simple one tells me nothing special. I wouldn't buy even a normal edition, much less this gigantic one. 

Actually, if you buy this it's as if you had bought a base game with 10 expansions (components, space and price wise).

I guess that since the game is pretty simple, the editors wanted to differentiate their product with the size. Otherwise it would just be one simple confrontation game more.

RATING: 8
The first and most popular Metagaming microgame there was, and actually one of the better ones. 

Staunch wargamers might prefer its expansion G.E.V. or the two latter Helltank micros for being more complex and offering more varied play (while the defenders are sweating and sweating the Ogres can sit, have a drink and wonder who they're going to ram). Nevertheless, for an average board game lover Ogre is an excellent introduction to wargaming: multiplayer fun is possible, the movement and combat mechanisms are sleek, the units used for battling each type of Ogre are reasonably well balanced, and the improbable, drastic concept of lots of infantry and armor trying to attack a monstrous single tank delivers tense plays, and less than an hour long.

This was a GREAT game in 1977 and the reprint is still a GREAT game. A nice game to introduce beginners to grognard style games.

This is one of those games that you can play several in a row and have a lot of fun each game.

Rating is for the ODE. Really fun stuff, on a huge scale. Rules aren't too heavy.

I've found this easy and fun to solo. It is very easy to design simple (or elaborate) programming for an Ogre to follow.

I have very fond memories of Ogre, which may have been the very first non-department-store-bought boardgame I ever played.  For an assymetric game, the balance of forces and goals in Ogre provides strangely just as much joy for the defender as the attacker.

My first "wargame" (excluding risk).  

I own the huge designer edition and tons of other crap, but what gets played most is the basic scenario of Mk III vs defending army.  A classic asymmetrical battle.  

As much as SJG fucked up the designer edition (lengthy delays, dealing with FMG, etc...) they more than atoned by releasing the $2.99 pocket edition.

EVERY gamer should have that $2.99 pocket edition in their collection.

The box is designed for storage but not for playing. Given all of the possible backer sheets of counters there's just too much that goes into the box.

Classic little game, and great for introducing people to the hobby.  Has a role playing aspect that sucks you into the game (especially as the Ogre).  However I enjoy GEV more, and so that is the one that actually gets played.  (However we do use ogres sometimes in GEV so this game is not wasted even tho it is not played.)

Note that the game is PERFECTLY balanced.  However it is a lot easier to learn the Ogre's strategy than the defender's.  I would recommend new players give a couple extra armor and infantry to the defender and as the defender gets better gradually cut this back.

# Comment to solo play
I found it not satisfying to play both sides. Maybe it's because I tend to loose ;-)
There's a solo play rule ("MOOSE" by Stephan Beal) that programs the Ogre to move and attack. However I think computers are better suited to execute those rules. So I rather play a computer game instead.

Now I know: I don't need it, although it's not bad at all. It's just not my cup of tea. For its age indeed it makes a lot of things right, speaking of the balanced forces: one HUGE monster of a tank against a lot of small units? It works ...

Ogre Designer's Edition is a treasure chest of material for creating memorable sci-fi tank battles.  As a kid I loved the pocket box versions of the game, as an adult I am blown away by the options this game give.

RATING: 6
I find that the Ogre is entirely impossible to beat. I have only used the Deluxe Edition (decent compared to todays standards) and would like to try the Mini's for it. The Mini's would also be more than just and Ogre vs a bunch of crap ships. It would be a wide and varied battle of really cool ships, with really simple combat and movement. Isn't that what everyone is looking for nowadays?

RATING: 5
Innovative premise in some weird way, but it's not a theme that is very interesting. Had this game not been released in 1977, it wouldn't have got much attention, me thinks. As a game it works fine, but it's pretty boring. Basically you just move a little and shoot, move a little and shoot. One side either wins by getting the hits it needs, or it doesn't. My rating is generous considering that I wouldn't likely play this game again any time soon. However, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the game.

Let's be honest: the promised second party expansions were not well handled - some still haven't been released. The miniatures were -insanely- expensive on Kickstarter. But the game has its merits.

Ogre is a good game, but the Pocket Edition is too small and fiddly for me. Very easy to accidentally knock pieces around when you're trying to move.

I might try making a somewhat-larger-but-still-portable version by gluing the little chits to either side of wooden cubes. (Would require two Pocket sets.)  Somewhat taller pieces might make it a lot more workable.  Should still fit in a fairly small box (e.g. one of those nice white home wifi router boxes.)

I have really fond memories of plunking down three bucks for Ogre sometime around 1980, and then reading the rules a million times and playing it solitaire when I should have been doing homework.  Amazingly, it still holds up as a small hex-and-counter game.  The Ogre is just so daunting, and seemingly invincible as all your tanks and infantry start making popcorn noises as they fly off the board.  Pop... pop pop poppopoppoppoppop!  But as you play, your defense gets better and better until you are more likely to stop the infernal Ogre than not.  Good game.

An oldie-but-goodie, especially if you can play a version with cool miniatures (helps to rinse away the taste of playing a game with a CRT). Don't expect the game to feel balanced on your first several plays... it takes a while to develop a good strategy against an Ogre. I can't imagine a better hex-and-counter wargame to get started on -- Ogre's no-frills design is strong and fresh 30 years later.

Got the pocket reprint, got to play it a few times with different people. Took me a while to finally get the rules right. A lot to remember, for just one little tank.

I feel there is a significant flaw in that you cannot shoot THEN move, which would allow you to retreat in a meaningful way. The description of the game says the Ogre can basically jump in and out of combat, outrunning some forces and scattering others to make them come in piecemeal, but really, the Ogre has only one thing to do: find the weak point in the artillery umbrella and charge it while the enemy gathers all his forces and tries to keep you surrounded.

There's no real war of maneuver here, which I think would be a real part of the game if you were allowed the option to shoot THEN move. Unfortunately I'm finding it hard to find someone to even play the game with more than once so that I can try out alternate rules.

The size alone makes it something special, but the gameplay is awesome.  Those two factors combined makes for a fantastic experience.  It takes a while to chew through the giant rule book, but once I became familiar with the mechanics, it's a surprisingly easy game to play.  Ease of play doesn't mean it's easy to win, however.  The learning curve is steep when it comes to strategy which allows for LOTS of playing and never having a game play the same way twice.

Steve Jackson went overboard on Ogre Designer's Edition. I mean that in a good way. Thanks to nearly 26 lbs of cardboard there are lots of options for many hours of game play in the box. The Combat Resolution Table (CRT) is a throwback to a different decade of gaming. But I didn't find it too overwhelming.

RATING: 9.5
Ogre is the best introduction to hex-and-counter wargaming I've ever seen. It provides the minimum chrome and theme needed to evoke a narrative without all of the complications of "serious" historical games. It lets a new player control a single unit rather than an army. It plays quickly and invites strategic analysis. But despite the simplicity, it packs enough strategic depth to enjoy replaying it many times. The variants are interesting too, but I'd happily play the basic Mark III scenario any time.

GEV is equally fascinating. At first glance, it's just a little step up from Ogre, adding a few simple terrain rules and letting two conventional forces duke it out. However - as the title implies - it's really about how you can utilize the mobility of the GEV's. Speed vs. power is a fundamental theme in wargaming, and GEV strips away all the usual wargaming clutter and focuses in on that one idea brilliantly. The scenarios are fantastic and offer just enough variability and fog of war so that you can replay any one of them over and over.

The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is that we still don't have a sensible, practical edition for day-to-day use. The Designer's Edition is ridiculously awesome, but so enormous that it's awkward even to play around the house, much less bring to a shop or game night. Pocket Ogre is a fantastic deal and eminently portable, but the little paper map isn't ideal for regular play, and GEV isn't included there either. Earlier releases include GEV but still have thin paper maps and lack decent die-cut counters to boot. As much as I love my 28 lb. DE box, this game cries out for a mid-priced, regularly boxed game that includes OGRE/GEV, decent basic counters, and reasonably sturdy mounted boards.

New sixth edition improves game play with bigger map and better pieces, but the outcome is still the same; the ogre is almost always going to win.  Load up on GEVs and throw your infantry into the treads to gum up the works; that's your only chance.

An old-fashioned hexes-and-chits wargame, recently spruced up with 3-D counters and plastic minis -- it's getting a little long in the tooth, now, but it might be an ideal intro to the old school for younger players. Still, I can't shake the feeling that there's not much there there.

Bought Ogre Deluxe (Deluxe Ogre?) on eBay... It cost a lot but it's the one with the miniatures and the big map. I also bought two copies (new in the shrink!) from Xeno Games in Canada.

Great mini-wargame, that I haven't played in forever.  (Thus I've pulled my rating.)  Hopefully I can get a play of this in sometime.

Play is biased towards the OGRE, but not   by so much that it feels "unfair."

Played it in the '70's when it was $2.95,
and completely got my money out of it.

How many times will I need to play it to break even on the kick-Strter version...?

This is the one that introduced me to the 'CrowdFunding' model.

I had played a few WarGames as a child,
but it was the MicroGame format of the '70's that made me a hard-core gamer and collector.
"Evil Unca Steve" grinned a grin, and decided to build a Monument to our mutual beginnings:

How could I say no?

Verdict: Rousing Success

Back surgery now necessary. Lawsuit forthcoming.

[i]Update:[/i]

We played starter Ogre three times at a four-day con, which was only possible after stuffing the basic bits into a significantly smaller box. There were dramatic moments and shouts of triumph, but ironically we discovered that operating a treaded killbot isn't nearly as enjoyable as coordinating infantry and armor units to shoot, scatter, and be rammed into paste.

The kickstarter version is a time capsule that offers a zillion tank variations and scenarios, but the game needs to be 300% more interesting - without being much longer - for me to want to play again.  The expansions may provide greater depth and replayability, but likely at a massive increase in playtime.  Ogre for 30-45 minutes?  Fine, occasionally. For 2-4 hours?  No way.

I say follow the money. The $2.95 pocket version is a keeper.  For $100+ you have better options elsewhere.  This one's past its sell-by date and not getting any younger.

A classic. This is a really nicely done design. Plays fast and makes you think of various strategies, especially with regards to initial unit choices. Feels satisfying on both sides, as the half-suicidal little tanks or the monstrous Ogre. Never played the GEV set included with mine; I have a feeling it's not quite the same.

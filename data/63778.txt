A great game for the classroom as it's playable in teams. Kids have lots of fun with it :)

(KIDS) Good party game.  I have one play with adults and it worked fine for us.  I expect my kids will also enjoy this game.  Now, I've played it with the kids and they love it too.  I'm really impressed with this as a party game because it doesn't have many of the pitfalls of so many party games, such as deciding which answers are acceptable.  The Junior version has worked well with kids and adults.

A very good game for use in the classroom.  Out of the Box produce a wonderful line of games.

Junior version of this excellent word game.
Make sure to give the kids the full allotment of time and then allow them to spell the selected word even if time has expired.

Great game to play with kids -- painless spelling practice they'll enjoy!  This version includes all letters of the alphabet and simplifies play by allowing the word to be spelled after time runs out.  Categories are also geared toward topics that would be general knowledge for kids.  Overall a great family game -- especially good for kids beginning around 3rd grade who are starting to get a good handle on spelling, but also good to play with younger kids who enjoy brainstorming words as part of a team. Minor quibble would be that the tiles, though relatively sturdy cardboard, are not nearly as nice as the heavy resin (?) tiles of the parent game.  At the lower price-point, though, this is not a big issue.

An excellent game for kids and adults.  The kids' version is different in that it uses all the letter of the alphabet, doesn't force the team to move the letters before the timer runs out, and allows a redo if a word is challenged and is found not to belong to the given category.  The category cards seem to be slightly easier for younger ages to think of words for, but honestly, this is very similar to the original version and could actually be used just fine with adults as well.

The category cards, being simpler, actually cultivate better gameplay than the adult version (this has fewer arguments about eligibility and more creative thinking). The kid-friendly rules are worse for adults (counting vowels is a terrible idea) but you could always play without them.

Not too much of a reason to own this if you have the regular game. I guess the cards may be a little more kid-friendly, but the game plays the exact same and the components are worse. Still, the game is enjoyable.

We usually love word games and we'd heard a lot of good stuff about this one but it didn't do anything for us or the kids.  Not sure why. Rather play Scrabble.

This is one of my 6 year olds current favorites along with Incan Gold.  If we are going to play a game he almost always picks this one out.  What's great about it is he is learning at the same time and doesn't even realize it!

I like the game mechanics a lot, and it's interesting how strategy changes as more and more of the letters are captured. Long words are no longer as useful as short words with the right letters.
However, the category cards seem flawed. Some categories have obvious answers, some have a very limited range of answers, while others have almost unlimited possibilities.
A variation I have found is to use a set of cards with words printed on them from another game (such as Apples to Apples) and allow each team to keep a hand of five cards to choose from.
This preserves the game mechanic while offering a more objective way of playing. It also works better with young children.

A fun way of helping children learn to spell. A definite buy if your youngster moans when learning the regular way. The game makes it fun, so they don't see it as a chore or get frustrated.

Fun, quick to teach, tug-of-war party word game. 2 teams compete to come up and spell the best word from bizaare catergories in order to accomplish pulling 5 letters over to their side.

For me this game is only a 6.2 (would be 8.2 if I had an equally matched opponent), but when I used this with 2nd graders they loved it and did so well. For that enjoyment I bumped it up.

It is a great game for ESL students. Creativity with vocabulary is endless. I would recommend this game for any classroom big or small. Convert the game and write it on the blackboard and split the class in two or play with the board with a small group of students. GET THIS GAME!

The label 'junior' in the title is deceptive -- this game is legitimately interesting and adults can play it without feeling that it has been dumbed down.  Players generate the vocabulary words, so it scale well between age groups.

Team up and compete for letters in this great game from Out of the Box. Who knew that spelling words and fighting over the letter "V" could be so fun? You can see our [thread=524438]full family video review of Word on the Street Junior here.[/thread]

*Owned for school - three copies* - We use this one for a guided reading center.  The kids don't usually like to play it competitively.  Instead, they'll help the other team to think of words and work together to spell them. :)

So far, all the adults and kids I've tried this with love it. The rules are simple enough and the actions are intuitive enough that non-gamers get it right away. The strategy is straightforward, so players can figure out what they need to do without being told. (It's been great fun to see the light bulb go off with kids: "No, no, 'shuttle' is a better world because it has a double letter!") Lots of spontaneous laughs and trash talking and fun tension as you try to pull that one letter back from your opponents.

First game of an ongoing series, concerning air combat in WW II called "FIGHTING WINGS"...
It's coming with a training scenario to get newbies into the system! 
Just look for the others:

* [GAMEID=5614] - 1995
* [GAMEID=8521] - 2003 
(* [GAMEID=40258] - 2010)
* [GAMEID=142521] - 2013

The rating is for the game series' system only; haven't played this one yet.

The first volume in the Fighting Wings series of games. While the rules have changed (for the better) from this volume to the latest volume (Whistling Death), the ADCs and scenarios found within are still valuable.

Very complicated, made more so by the horrible rule book. I enjoyed the game the time or two I played it, but the rules took forever to decipher. Sold my copy (no opponents, no desire to create any).

If you're just starting out, get the Quick-Start rules. They're quick, they're simple, they're SHORT, and they capture the essence of the game.

The best WWII air combat board game available. That said, you'll want the next two games, or at least Whistling Death, to get the fully-updated rules with all the errata. (Be sure to download the errata file: http://www.clashofarms.com/files/fighting-wings.pdf)

JD's comments on his own game are largely on target. OtR suffers from too many fiddly exceptions in the rules, which become worse as the series progresses.

RATING: 6
rating is a recent downgrade of all complicated air combat games.  I have had an epiphany that for all the mental overhead, they just aren't that fun to play and it is too difficult to find opponents.  Many of the games just end up being indecisive turn-fests, or won by a lucky shot/initiative die-roll.

RATING: N/A
I just receive it and need time to make an opinion, but with the improvement provided by whistling death, it would probably be better. (36 "B 17" counters... can you imagine them all in the map?)

RATING: 7
The starter of the Fighting Wing series. It is very detailed and I like the time frame it covers.

Pros: very detailed; it lets you play entire missions; well supported by its author; it can be played with newer rule sets; op scale and tac scale give depth to the game.

Cons: overdetailed; a lot of work for a 4.1 sec game turn; the op scale aspect of the game could be expanded and include op scale maps.

Sometimes difficult mechanics tend to draw game out some. Actually participated in a playteat of this game. Good game for those who want as realisic boardgame as possible.

RATING: 6
A little more complicated than I really like for a WWII air combat game. Probably the best one out there though. More complex than The Speed of Heat (the game J. D. released before this one) and that one felt about right in terms of a balance between a game and a simulation.

I found it fiddly, but probably any decent air game would be.

RATING: 7
My first attempt at a world war two design after designing Air Sup. and Air Strike, and while working on Speed of Heat.  Got a bunch a things right, and some things wrong.  The vertical flight system was chunky, being brought in from Air Sup. and never felt quite right. The operational scale rules were too coarse although they got the job done.  The operational scale system in Whistling Death is very different and more satisfying.  The stuff that worked well was the scale, and the era (Mustangs and such).  My goal was to make a better game than Air Force / Dauntless and that I believe it is... The new generation Fighting Wings Rules in Whistling Death a much more solid and feel a lot more like flying.  I kept the combat system intact and the data card formatting is virtually unchanged so those that are interested can take the airplanes and scenarios out of this game and fly them with Whistling Death rules.

I was a solid fan of Airforce/Dauntless, but yearned for game with more realistic aerodynamic modeling.  I tried Lou Zocchi's Basic/Advanced Fighter Combat rules.  The basic rules weren't enough of an improvement over Air Force/Dauntless.  The advanced rules addressed individual aircraft performance differences, but flying a nanogram (graphical representation of aircraft aerodynamic performance values) was tedious.  J.D. Webster's Over The Reich accomplished the perfect balance between aerodynamic performance detail and game playability.  With Whistling Death rules and updated aircraft performance charts, this game will remain my favorite air combat game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The designer's efforts in recreating an air combat model is so amazing with the no. of scenarios and variety of planes in Whistling Death.  This system is so well acclaimed that if I have the chance to go through all the series games, I am in heaven....

Air Superiority goes Propeller and WW2, looking at the late war and the american entry in the european theatre. If you want to play the Fighting Wings series of games, make sure you get the latest edition of the rules (Whistling Death), vertical maneuvering isn't the same without it.

A vast improvement over previous efforts at WWII Air Combat.  Actually allows 3D maneuver, but vertical flight model a bit clunky in places (rectified in 2Ed rules in Whistling Death).

WW2 Air Combat - Part 2 - RAF vs Luftwaffe, a must have for WW2 air combat aficionados.

I've played this game system (Fighting Wings) more over its lifetime than anything else.  I love the granularity in distinguishing aircraft and that the game does a good job of giving a feel for the tactics and flying within the confines of a fun game.

There are a ton of aircraft data cards and scenarios.  A huge amount of play value.

Because they're all the same system (though the base system has been refined over the years, I play all of them with the latest rules and there is full backward compatibility in the games), I have the same comments for Over the Reich, Achtung Spitfire! and Whistling Death.

Excellent game system. This is the first game in the Fighting Wings System and both the rules and many of the technical details have been updated and streamlined. But still a great game nonetheless and the system itself is great. Always happy to play scenarios from this system.

Fighting Wings goes late-war.  More refined rules.  The operational game provides useful scenario build over just "line 'em up and fight."

J.D. Webster's Fighting Wings series of games are the best World War II air combat games ever.  My rating reflects that I play Over the Reich using the 2nd edition rules found in Whistling Death.

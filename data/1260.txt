[I]tl;dr - Rook is a great little trick-taking card game that is one of the few games I grew up playing and still remember fondly. I can't say it's an incredible game, but I'd probably still pick it over shanghai rummy, phase 10, or golf.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

My copy was missing a few cards, so I thrifted it again. Still might pick this one up, but I might just pick [thing=215][/thing] as my traditional card game.

RATING: 7.5
Easy-to-learn trick-taking game with ample room for clever card play.  As far as I can tell, the public domain game that Rook most closely resembles is Cinch.  Deluxe Rook comes with a good book that explains strategy.  The latest edition (2001) has nice graphics.  Play without the Rook card for a more strategic game; play with it for a more casual game.

A nice little trick taking game with a nice power card to mix things up. I enjoy it more that spades and hearts and especially bridge. I can't compare with Tichu because these are not really "birds of a feather", (much pun intended)

RATING: 4
It's better than I rated it, but that's accurate for how I feel about the game.  Another of the annoying traditions of my in-laws.  I would probably love playing this with a regular gaming group.  As part of a warped sibling rivalry it becomes a sad thing.

With house varients...(1) Rook is NOT wild, rather is the worst trump (permanent "Rook Low"). (2) In addition to the regular ranking (1-5), player who takes kitty can inverse so 5, 6, 7...14, 1, Rook is the order of trump.

These slight changes make Rook a great game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An interesting trick-taking game that's similar to both Bridge and Pinochle.  Can play in teams or as individuals.

My complaint with the game itself is that bidding is tough; unless you have a really good hand, making the minimum bid (which is 70 out of a possible 120 points) is going to be rather challenging.  Other than that, it's a fun game that honestly does not need a separate deck of cards; just use a standard deck of playing cards!  Save the money!

My favorite game.  I love it(specifially the 1 high,Rook is trump but lowest power and still counts as 20 points).  It is a kind of therapy for me when I get to play it.  It has obvious similarities to bridge.  

A hand can be worth 200 points and is based on points given for "counters"(cards with a 1-14-10-5 or bird), and points given by having the majority of the tricks (20 points).

There is an aspect with enough games played where a player learns to know cards held by opposing teams and I love this "card counting" aspect of it.  The deductive reasoning behind it.  

I grew up playing this at family gatherings and the aspect of bidding and trick taking are something I have liked in other various games also.

The best game created by man. A classic trump game that awards points for winning certain cards as opposed to tricks. People who like counting cards and deducing who has what and how best to play will love this game. Just for the record: call partner, rook low, points in the kitty, 1's high and worth 15 points, and a high bid of 180 is the right way to play.

This is a 9 if played according to the right rules (that is, the rules I prefer, most notably that the rook is at 10 1/2).  There are so many different house rules around that I don't play often--it's too frustrating to adapt strategy to yet another set of house rules.  Or in my opinion, there is no strategy to the game if the rook is high: bid if you have the rook, don't bid if you don't.

We have only played this 2-player.  A dummy hand is used, and its cards are played out in the order dealt, regardless of suit.  This is quite random for a trick taking game.  Play this when you're in a light mood; the dummy's plays can be kind of funny.

As per usual, Hubby completely whooped me. He says its the years of playing hearts with his family. I just don't seem to "get" and therefor I don't enjoy trick-taking games. The cards were very nice and the 2 player variant was interesting with the dummy player. We picked this one up at Savers for less than $1 since it was in a bundle of other card games-and since it's a game many of our family seems to be familiar with-it'll stay in the collection

This was the go to game for my family growing up.  My father has a "Rook Book". It has every game played going back to the 60's.  The book will be our families heirloom.  Each game is dated.  There are many people that are in that book that have now passed.  When looking over the book it brings back good memories of the fun times I had with them while they were alive.  The game ties this together and is woven into the fabric of my upbringing. It will always be a game that I will gladly play.  (Our family is a Rook high family)

There is such great joy to be had sitting around a table killing time and chatting with the family. This is such an easy game to teach and yet such a hard game to master. As such, it will always be a 10. I will never turn down a game! I own at least 20 copies of the game if not more.

I spent a summer playing this with the parents and partner on a nightly basis.  I found it quite enjoyable.  It can be played with partners or without.  

It is a trick taking game where players bid to name trump, but in addition to getting to name the trump, the winner also gets to take some unknown bonus cards and bury some cards from his hand.  

Plays:  10+

Nostalgia may figure into my rating. Playing cards with a regular deck horrified my grandmother, who considered it gambling. However, we occasionally could talk her into Rook. After being introduced to many other trick-taking games, I still believe that five-player call-your-partner Rook is one of the better such games out there if the Rook's rank is reduced to, say, between the 10 and 11 of trump.

This a great trick taking card game.  Similar to many [gameid=21804] this game combines the play of [gameid=13337] games like [gameid=2181] and [gameid=592], but the point cards taken in tricks is similar to [gameid=4583].  Often used by some church groups who don't like playing [[standard deck playing card games]].

Best in the 4-player partnership game.

Generally I prefer [gameid=2181] or [gameid=4583] (Partnership), but I like this game in its own right, and sometimes [gameid=1260] is the trick-taking game I would prefer.  Good memories playing with the family at night when we camped in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons on a family trip when I was young.

Rook is a trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers. The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).

The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card). Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand. Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color. A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick. The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick. Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.

The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.

Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker. The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits from a standard deck of cards, has often been a card game played by religious groups who object to using a standard deck of cards.

Game I played a ton growing up with my extended family.  I enjoy the bidding and the partnership aspect a lot, as well as the needed ability to memorize whats been played.  Theres some risk taking involved too. Theres a lot of different ways to play this game both in rule changes and number of players (oddly enough my family rarely used the rook bird card, we scored the last trick 20 points). Only issue is this needs to be played with experienced players to be any fun.

Decent trick taking game with bidding.  A nice touch is that the highest bidder has choice of trump, and can exchange with the "nest".  Somewhat similar concept to the game "500", but the aim of Rook is to win tricks with point cards, rather than the maximum number of tricks.  Including the Rook card as a 20 point highest trump in the "Kentucky Discard (Tournament Rules)" turns the game into somewhat of a lottery and can detract from skilled play, so the "Kentucky Discard (Original Rules)" without the Rook is perhaps preferred.  There are several other good variations including "Regular Partnership" and "1-High Partnership".  "Call Partner" also gives the game an interesting twist, and is also well suited for a five player game.  If you enjoy partnership trick taking games, this is definitely a must.  Can easily be played with a regular deck, called "[b][gameid=154299][/b]" (derived from Kentucky Discard), or with rules described by Hoyle (derived from 1-High Partnership).

Rook is nearly a very good game, but the overpowered Rook card ruins it. The obvious solution is to play without the Rook card! Another solution is to keep the Rook, but make it the lowest trump. I also recommend making the 1's high in each suit, so that the 14's are not automatic points. With these fixes, Rook plays like a lighter, more accessible version of Bridge - in the same vein as Spades, but better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Classic game that I grew up playing with my family. I get bored with card games where one player wins the majority of tricks. The game becomes about managing the damage received when you don't win the bid, and hitting the other team hard when you do win the bid. However, everything is about winning the bid and that means being dealt the best hand (or hoping the Rook is in the 'Kitty). Gave this game up in favor of Spades, but then returned to it in Grad School. A friend and I played around with rule variants and decided that the game is best when the Rook is the lowest trump, the 1's are not points, and the 2,3,4's are not removed from the deck. Otherwise the game is just a way to pass time (and a bad one at that).

First played this on March 21st, 2007 (at least that I know of? May have as a kid?). A fun trick taking game. There are many variants. Taught in ~5min, play in 1hr for 4 players. We played Discard or Kentucky. Deck is 1-14 in four suits(optionally played with the rook card and discard the yellow 1). Dealer passes each 13 cards and deals the nest the first 4 rounds. Bidding starts with the dealers left in increments of 5. Once you pass, you can not re-enter bidding. Bid winner/declarer looks at the nest and decides what call trumps and what to burry in the nest. Left of dealer starts a normal trick taking round. High card wins, must follow suit. Rook card is highest card and must be played if player has no other trumps, however can be played on non-trump hand even if they could follow suit. Last trick wins nest(can have pt cards in it). To make your bid, you collect 5's, 10's, 14's(worth 10) and the rook(worth 20) card with a total possible hand of 120 points. If declarer team makes their bid, they get the points, otherwise are set and get minus their bid. Opponents get point cards. After 4 deals, left two players swap positions and play 4 more hands. For the last 4 hands the dealer's right two players swap places. Play to 300 pts. Misdeal(before is redeal) after 3 tricks and table talk is -40 and redeal. I'd recommend giving this a game play. It's worth consideration for a game in your collection to play on a regular basis.

Dec09:

A perfectly okay trick taking game.  I did not play *exactly* the rules as written.

My main issues?  Most of the time the team that doesn't call trump is only going to take 2-3 tricks.  That boils the card play down too much.  (I have similar issues with Sheepshead, but there it's at least 1-2 tricks out of 6 instead of 2-3 out of 13.)

I also find much amusement with religious folks not liking faces on their cards.

And I also played with the rook having the highest score value but being only the lowest trump.  This was a *very* nice feature.

But overall?  Go play Spades.

Similar to Skat and Tarock, in which the object is to take not a certain number of tricks, but a certain number of points in the tricks you take.  This gives it a subtly different feel from Bridge and Spades.  Not the best trick-taking game, but very good nonetheless.

I am just a total fan of all the cheap card games that you can get at your local walmart, target, kmart whatever. They are cheap, quick to learn, quick to play, and they are quite fun to play with family and friends, especially if you dont feel like dragging out a big board game. 

Rook isnt too bad of a game.  A little deeper than Uno but not to bad.

A great partnership trick-taking game with a tense bidding mechanism. Each partnership bids on how many points they will score, and winning bid gets the right to call trump. However the other team has no risk, scoring whatever points they claim while the winning bid has to meet their minimum.

RATING: 7
Christian cards; a Midwest favorite, it's a 56-card deck with one joker. Ironically, the deck is a re-facing of the 78-card Tarot deck without the 21 trumps, and the rules and strategy of Rook are very similar to many European trick-taking games played with some subset of the Tarot. Deeper than Hearts or Spades, closer to Bridge but far simpler.

This game is still inferior to 500, which I think is the best version of Triumph (can make a good case for Bridge but it's 100x easier to learn 500 for 90% of the depth), but lots of people recognize this version, which adds to its value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My preferred variant: leave out the 1-4 cards for speed, assign the Rook a card value of 9.5 (thus losing to 10-14 of trump suit) while retaining trump and 20-point status.  This allows the table to make credible high bids even if not holding the Rook.

Played countless games of this over the years. Except for War and maybe Dutch Blitz, this is one of the first games my parents taught me.

Can't play with strangers due to the number of variants. I was shocked that not everyone removes the 2-4 of each color or make the Rook a power of 10.5. How could you ever call anything but the Rook partner if it was the top dog? So much more interesting the way I was taught.

[4 players] "200" is a good partnership trick taking game with bidding. The highest bidder has choice of trump, and can exchange with the "nest/kitty". Similar to the game "500", but the aim of "200" is to win tricks with point cards, rather than the maximum number of tricks, with the Rook/Joker card worth 20 point cards. Several good variations exist.

I have vague memories of playing this game while I was laid up in the hospital in Turkey, thousands of miles away from my family and longtime friends.  A new friend of mine was very kind to visit me frequently, and would bring this game along.  My view of this game is probably greatly influenced by the depression of the memory (long hospitalization and far, far away from home) so it is probably unfair.  I somehow have a deck in my collection, so I want to try to play it and see how I truly feel about this game.  For now, I will take the easy way out and stand by my 3.  I know, probably very unfair, it is most likely a fine game.

This game involves bidding and taking tricks with pointers on them.  It's similar to a lot of card games out there.  Not too bad for the challenge.  I think the big challenge is trying get the pointer cards, which are not the ones that will usually take a trick.

Play with a handful of variations:

1) Rook is a 10.5 (between 10 & 11)
2) Whoever calls trump, their partner is the person with the 13 of that suit. This could mean a 3v1 match.

Rook is a simple trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers. At a time when many religious leaders called the use of a standard deck of playing cards "evil" because they were also used to tell fortunes, The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits, was used as a way for ultra-conservative religious people to enjoy card playing. For this reason, Rook has been referred to as Missionary Poker. There are many variations on the standard game, some quite good!

Haven't played this game in many years, but at one point this was a staple for me and a group of friends.

Use the Princeton variant and a normal deck of cards.

My go to card game for 3...four is fine here, but I'd rather be playing Tichu at that player count...love the two against one aspect of 3p. I don't play with the rook card, what is this variant called? Kentucky discard, I believe. So 100 point hands, min 50 point bid. Like the all low-mid-and-high-cards-score, in and out of trump, that's a clever variation, clever enough for it to warrant a place at my table.

Rook is easily in the top 5 of the games I've played the most and probably makes a pretty good case for number 1.  We played through decks of this pretty regularly when I was in college.  I think part of the fun of this game was the guys I played with, as I have rarely played as much with others.  At any rate, I have a general phobia of bidding in cards games, as I am often too conservative for my own good.  However, with such relatively small hands, choosing trump becomes very important.  Add a partner that must be taken into account and you have an interesting problem.  Throw in the highly mobile Rook of the tournament rules, and things get interesting fast.  I also enjoy the fact that playing to set someone is so much fun.  Oh I wish I could play this more often.

A very good trick taking game, though my favorite is Sheepshead.  I play 4 player with rook a 10.5 of the called suit (black if going no trump).  The only fault is that your partner is constant which could result in collusion.  The newest print of the official cards are garbage. Get an old deck off ebay or get cards from 57 Cards.

Trick-taking and bidding game, where not every hand counts, and you need to be aware of who is holding which cards.

As a good Southerner, I am legally required to like this game...and I do!  I've been playing it on and off for well over forty years.  Bridge is often too much of a committment to learn and play, and this game is a great alternative.  The "special deck" (suits are colors, no face cards, no aces per se) of cards also adds a little something to the game as well, although it could easily be played with a standard deck of playing cards. A pleasing classic.

Just another trick taking game, this time with the ugliest cards ever! Played in pairs with a round of bidding as to how many points you'll make which then allows you access to the 'nest' of cards to tailor your hand a little.

My parents used to play this game when I was little so maybe that sparked the interest. I like this card game more than any other I've played. When my wife and I started dating 10 years ago I taught her how to play. When her sister got a boyfriend we played every weekend. We always played guys against girls except for a few times. The funny thing is that me and him have won every game played over 10 years except 3! I'll admit that the girls won those 3 games all in row however. Anyway, I would gladly suggest this one to people who regularly have 4 people present.

They accuse us of cheating for some reason. Sore losers I think. :)

I'm like many of you who are from multi-generaton Rook players. So, of course, my rating may seem quite biased. I still remember the many, many games of Rook with my grandparents and parents, and now cousins and nephews and nieces.  We candidly call it "Baptist Poker"--if you happen to be Baptist, you'll understand :)My father learned a variant from Wheaton College, way back when, where the Rook, although still worth 20 points if taken, is a 10 1/2: that is, it can take a 10 of trump, but an 11 can take it! This makes it more exciting than the "official rules."  We still haven't met people who play Rook this way, but it makes for an exciting, more strategic game! (I'll post this under Variants).

This can be played with a standard deck, but the official deck is cheap, so you might as well buy it. This is fun with more players. With 2, you use a dummy player. Compared to many other games, it's not that great, but for a standard card game, it can be fun. The teamwork aspect is cool.

The earliest trick taking card game I played as a child in Michegan with relatives.  It would probably still be popular if other games like Whist, Wizard, and Sieben Seigal didn't take its place. Coolest when you realize the game was designed by George PARKER!

Terri wanted to play Rook because of a werewolf friend.  Amy and Gene had played it before with family.  I had heard of the game before, but I had previously assumed it was a regular card game.  I really didn't know what to expect.

On top of that, I haven't played any partnership games before, and very few trick taking games.  We normally have 5 players, so that makes partnership games a little rough, and most trick games do not support 5 players, at least not the ones we have.

So what did I think?  Well, we played with the rules out of the box, and the 70 starting bid is pretty rough.  We only had two rounds where scores were equal to or higher than 70.  I had an awesome hand the first round and confidently bid way too high.  The cards in the nest only made my hand better, but I couldn't make my high bid.  After that, most of our points came from getting enough points to keep the other side from making their bid.  I'm not sure how the bidding is supposed to work, but it seems that the starting player is forced to bid that they are going to win regardless of what their hand looks like.  I think I would prefer to start with a lower minimum bid.

I thought the partnership part was pretty interesting.  I never understood how the players could work together, but I sort of see it now.  It made for an interesting game that I would be happy to try again.  Unfortunately, I am not sure if my rating is for this game, or for the stuff that was new to me.  I'll re-rate it after I get some more trick-taking and partnership games under my belt.

If I am going to play a trick-taking game, I'd rather play Rage/Oh Hell for a fun time, or traditional contract Bridge for a more serious and thinky time. Rook doesn't scratch either of those itches.

I cut my teeth on this game growing up.  It's what led me into the wonderful world of bridge.  Sadly, I rarely have opportunity to play this now.  It's a team contract game in the vein of bridge.  Much simpler bidding or at least it was for me.  The object is to take point cards not necessarily tricks.  There's a kitty, contract player gets to add these to his/her hand and discard an equal number of cards before declaring the trump suit.  There is a rook, called the birdie in my circle, which is a super trump and can be played at any time.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely needs to be played with the rook valued at 10.5.
Great with 5 players with a secret partner of the bidder (the bidder declares a trump suit and card that belongs to their partner)

I haven't played this in a long, long time, but what I remember was that it was a collection of pretty standard card games, most of which were trick-taking games.  There's not a whole lot of reason to go for this particular game, rather than all the public domain games out there like [gameid=6887], [gameid=6901], or [gameid=13123].

Rook is a trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers. The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).
\13\\13\
The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card). Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand. Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color. A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick. The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick. Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.
\13\\13\
The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.

My family's favorite and the game I was weaned on. Way better than spades if you're in the mood for a trump-based game - maybe even as good as euchre (which it is quite similar to). I doubt I could count the number of games I've played of this over the years: it's to the point where I can partially distill someone's personality down from the way they play.

The game played much more quickly than I expected.  I am also not very good.  My wife beat me handily three times in a row and quickly lost interest with the whole game.  Maybe if I had more time/rounds to play out more options the game would improve?  I wonder if Pinko Pallino would be better, or if it would just prolong the inevitable.  I would be willing to play more to get better, but I don't know if I will have much opportunity to do so.

ABSTRACT

An abstract strategy game. Be the first player to make it across the board while ensnaring your opponent in a maze of your own construction.

A thrift store find. A good lunch time selection.

Recommended with 2 and 4 players (best 2). 15 mins.

The number of pieces inside the box, and the size of the rules, may make you thing something like "it cannot be good". But believe me, it's a really great game.

I'm not a great fan of abstract games (don't like chess that much), but this one is really a very good one, very challenging, mind puzzling, with every move being very tense.

Not a terrible game...I'm just surprised by the game's ranking.  There is not much here.  It's an extremely short game, and it seems to have little replayability.  Once you figure out the game's few nuances, it starts to feel very samey and somewhat "programmed" (like, say, Connect 4).

I bought the Deluxe version from one of the last places I could find it on sale anywhere in the world www.math-n-stuff.com (An amzing shop with very helpful people). Another quality game with good components, nothing flimsy. I've probably played this game about 30 times now and love it. Two player games can get pretty deep and every game I'm always looking at different strategy's. My girlfriend likes playing Quoridor four player because of all the arguing and bickering that goes on with my family. There does seem to be a lot of king making in the four player version but this doesn't take away from the enjoyment. My little 8 year old cousin also loves it.

This game can be very annoying and very fun at the same time.  From the start there is one way you can go that will pretty much guarantee advancement up the board at a later point.  Sometimes blocking your own paths at the back end will result in a game win as it will keep your apponent from pushing you back too far.  Great little two player game too.  This is another one my wife will not play often with me (only because the one time we played, I drove her all the way to one corner before she realised that she would get nowhere going that way, and while she was trying to backtrack, I made my way straight up the board using a path that she could not block at all.  Reminder for next time . . . Let the Wifie win.

My favorite Gigamic offering.  Another game a colleague at work and I have sparred over.  He started out strong, but I've experimented more to see what works.  Get a kick out of defeating him with one strategy, and when he tries to replicate it, beating him with another startegy.  So easy to learn how to play, but fine tuning a strategy that consistantly works can take a long time.  Desire to play with four to see how that changes things up.  [1: Gift 2: Thrift $1.09]

Game is complete and in very nice shape.  All walls, pawns, and board looks super.  The felt feet are not applied to the board, but there's only two on the sticker pad, so that's really not an option.  The box shows very little shelf wear and is solid.  Unfortunately, someone wrote with a ballpoint pen on the lid, "Steve & Brenda Hatcher."  Of course, if that's your name, this would be a perfect game for you.  If it's not your name, and you care more about the game than the box which holds it, this is also a perfect game for you.

My 7 year old and I have been playing this quite a bit. It's great because it is easy to handicap. We play that each time you win, the loser gets to have one of the winner's walls during the next game. So if you started out at 10 walls to 10 (like normal),  for the next game, the winner would get 9 walls and the loser would get 11.

2 player abstract goodness! This game has great components (I own the Gigamic version). Any game I can get my GF to play gets high marks in my book, and this is one of them. Agonizing decisions every turn. Should I move my piece, or should I place a wall? Great stuff!

I thought that a couple of plays would reveal all the variations of this game. I was happy to find out that you can play this game many, many times and still come up with new board arrangements.  The game is in the wall placements.  It is almost never necessary to actually move your pawn all of the way to the other side.  The winner will become apparent as the walls are created.

The two keys to the depth of this game are: the rule that you can't completely block your opponent's path creates many opportunities to force moves or block wall placements; and the fact that the walls are two spaces in length which lends to the creation of unique layouts and when combined with the fact that players cannot be completely blocked creates opportunites to block wall placements.

The "Classic" wood set is pretty.

This is very simple game that I enjoy as much as my 5 and 7 yr olds.  It can be played quickly or with some deliberation which makes it enjoyable for all.  My kids and really like the maze aspect of the game where in one clever move you can make your opponent have to backtrack across the board.

This abstract just did not sit well with me. Slowly moving toward each other was interesting and it has good wooden components but the game play is just no fun for me. Maybe I just suck at it but I always found I would get blocked then I'd have to spend a bunch of turns going back around this long wall I just spent multiple turns building.

Disappointed with the edition I purchased.  Wooden components were the least refined I'd ever seen.  Plus, what I thought would be a good 2-player game with my wife, turned into a real snooze fest.  The strategy didn't work for either my wife or me.  Traded away.

Good fun - though in the two player games I've played it seemed fairly obvious about half way through who the winner would be - so while it is a great game - certainly a brain teaser - it was a little too expensive and a little too dry for my taste.

Not sure why this one is rated so highly. After an initial set of moves it's obvious who will win the round... you can count the moves. I do not like games where halfway through it is obvious who is going to win, without a chance for the lagging player to possibly catch up (no matter what side of that equation I'm on).

This game has room for depth. Where you want to place your walls in anticipation of the walls you will be placing later, or your opponent would like to place. In other words, wall placement can be defensive, offensive, pre-emptive. And I'm sure more, I'm a beginner at the game.

Very similar to old Lakeside game "Blockade".  I like Blockade better because it has two pawns, allowing for more feints; it limits how walls can be played, requiring better management; and places the targets more centrally, meaning that paths can be more convoluted.

With three simple rules this game is a quick playing gem of an abstract.  Short enough to allow you to experiment, easy for new players to pick up but with a depth that's surprising.

Quite nice. Simple rules: add a two-space fence ( you have ten, i believe) or move you pawn one space. Winner is the first to the other side. Each player must always have at least one viable path to get there. Some surprising play patterns emerged against my five-year-old.

Great abstract to start the kids on!  So far I've only played with my 5 y.o. who is just learning that maybe it's not the best strategy to use up all her fences blocking me in the initial moves of the game.  The more we play, the more she starts to "get it".  I love Big Kat's handicapping idea where the loser gets to start the next game with one of the winner's fences -- that seems like a great way to play with young kids.
Would love to play a few games vs. an adult to get a better feel for the subtlety of the game.

Truly a vicious, mean little game, and (despite or because of this) one of my absolute favorites.  

The only problem I have is that it starts to become increasingly grueling and stressful if you play more than two or three games in a row.  It becomes more about psychology than tactics as you learn your opponent's tricks and begin double/triple/quadruple thinking each other.

Quorridor is my favorite abstract -- it's intuitive, it looks great, it plays well, it has just the right amount of confrontation without verging on acrimony... great stuff.  The reason I give it a ten is because it's a great gateway game.  Nongamers can absorb the rules easily and identify with the goal quickly; it's fast enough that it doesn't get mired down; and people can get good at it very quickly, so after, say, three games, the players are on close-to-even footing.  If I were to bring a game along on a date, this is the one I'd pick.

My second favourite Gigamic game, after Pylos. Players set eachother difficult puzzles in the form of a slowly growing maze on a square grid. Either move, or place a wall. If you run out, you can only move. I still find the jumping rules confusing. How big is the first player advantage? More analysis is needed. Some opening strategy is known. There is a bot and an iphone app, both are terrible players however.

Quoridor is one of my most-played games. That said, I don't think it's one of the better abstract strategy games; I'd put it at average at best. My friends don't see it the same way, though; the attractive board and immediately appealing strategy (everyone loves mazes) are quick to grab people. This is one of the major reasons I appreciate attractive productions -it becomes far easier to entice other people to play.

What do you get when you play? Well, you start with a board-forming element, attempting to create walls and boxes that correspond to giving your opponent lots of space and you little space while maintaining a high board count. After this initial phase, there's a long, drawn-out walk to the opponents side with the occasional board placement.

You may have guessed that I find the later parts of the game less interesting than the earlier. You would be correct; proper play in later parts of the game becomes a simple exercise in combinatorial analysis. It doesn't demonstrate any of what I find interesting in games, and it can take a while (online in particular). Quoridor's narrative arc ends with an extended bunch of boring; a problem in any game, particularly in abstracts.

The first part of the game can be interesting, of course. Unfortunately, there's some fairly rote aggressive play that will wipe the floor with newcomers. The game isn't broken, but there's a local maxima that will take a while to get past. Beyond that, there's a somewhat interesting area enclosure game with minor elements of resource management.

The enclosure and resource management games are fine, but the boring endgame and strong local maximum strategy, there are better abstracts out there. (Also, the game can reach an awkward, poorly defined stalemate, which is unappealing aesthetically.)

Not sure what to make of this one. It is fast and fun, to a point, but most of our games consist of a series of many turns where you feel like you're doing well and have a handle on things, followed 1-2 turns later by a sudden realization of "Oh, crap! I'm completely screwed." Then at some point we don't finish the game because one player can no longer win. I'm probably missing something. More plays may reveal.  It's fairly easy to get the game to the table just because it's so fast and easy to get into.

A strategic abstract with two players, excellent but random with four. Everyone always wants a rematch to exact revenge on whoever screwed them by a well placed wall. Such a simple decision of wall or movement can be agonizing.

This is an excellent beginning strategy game for younger players while still being a lot of fun as a quick or in-between game for adults.

This was my first abstract game and I still love the quality of the Euro-style wooden components.

RATING: 6
The fist thing to say about the game is that it's extremely attractive.  I like the simplicity of the wooden components and the board.  Secondly this is a really easy to learn abstract with no setup whatsoever.  Abstract strategy games are not my favorite but this one is quick enough that I would consider playing this one a few times in a row if people wanted me to.

Meh.  Game is kind of bland to me.  Game is also too short for an abstract.  I have only played 2 player.  It seems as though a 4 player game might be more exciting, although the BGG community prefers 2 player.

RATING: 7
Solid, fast playing abstract strategy. Lots of room for creative play. 

That being said it's still an abstract strategy. I think that eight is about the highest I can rate an abstract because of the mood an abstract game can convey. When playing an abstract, one can forget the other virtue of board gaming: socialization. 

Although I feel this game is about as good as it gets in the abstract category, I can't see myself going back to it constantly becasue it can really zap a good conversation through intense concentration.

It catches people's interest, has a 25-second rules explanation, and feels stupidly easy... until you get your butt kicked. Plays in just a few minutes, so you're at it again, and you tell yourself that THIS time you'll pay better attention...
I imagine that when playing enough of this against an equal opponent you will have fewer and fewer surprises. But brought out periodically in small doses, I just adore this game.

Not a new idea, but it is a new twist.  reasonably fast, simple rules, nicely made.  Great 2-player game, especially for reluctant spouses who just want to get it over with.  The fast & simple satisfies him.  

The jump rule nicely reduces the 1st person advantage.  If the first player just plans on a straight-ahead race, and no one places barriers, he will lose.  

For some reason I think these barrier/race-to-the-other-side are just okay, such as Twixt and Punct.  I do however like Tayu.

Played a couple of two player games and so far I'm interested to play some more.  The options are limited but I like how the barriers must be placed as to hinder your opponent while not limiting your own progress too much.  Thing is as you develop your path, it becomes easier to be blocked; so you should hold on to some barriers for the last stretch ditch.

Magnífico jogo de movimentação e conflito de área. Muito simples. Um tabuleiro quadrado formado por pequenos quadros. Cada jogador deve mover seu peão, quadrado por quadrado, até o lado oposto ao que iniciou. Na jogada cada um pode fazer uma ação de duas: Mover o peão um espaço na direção que quiser; ou colocar uma barreira no local que quiser do tabuleiro. O ponto alto do jogo é bloquear os adversários fazendo-os dar um volta enorme para chegar ao lado oposto. Várias empresas nacionais produzem o jogo. Recomendo.

Quoridor is another Gigamic game I put in the 'light' category, but it remains an interesting tactical game.  While the game is very simple, it is all about timing.  Quoridor becomes a tense game of reaction and really trying to anticipate when placing a wall only affects your opponent and doesn't sting you at a later time.  This game is a decent abstract filler. Though turns can feel obvious at times and the game can be chaotic with 4 players.

An abstract strategy game of trying to get your pawns across the grid to your opponents side. Of course they are trying to hinder your movement by setting up walls to force you around. You are doing the same to them. Thus the name of the game, because once your done the grid has become a maze of corridors. You can never totally enclose an area so it maintains the maze look.  A fun game that makes you think since you have to choose between move a pawn or build a wall. Easy to teach.

RATING: 5
Lots of evil little moves you can pull on one another, and though it can be a drag to go back and forth across the board multiple times per game, that's really part of it's charm. It makes it funny. At the time I'm writing this I've played about 10 1 on 1 games. The strategy is actually quite interesting, some backwards thinking involved. I do like it right now, but I think it might get old unless I play in moderation. I'll probably bust it out every once in a while to keep it fresh. Pretty unique idea though, well made, pretty board. EASY EASY to learn with only 2 maybe 3 rules.

I've also played a couple games with 4 players which really added an interesting dynamic. You can work together to stop whoever's in in danger of taking the game, but ultimately you're in it for yourself. It's chaotic and funny.

I don’t consider myself as an abstract player, but this is a decent one. In this game you are trying to move to the other side while constricting the other players with wall blocks. You can’t block them totally. There are some nice tactics to the game and is fast and fun. I can see that this will become arbitrary after a few games, but as for now it has held up.

Tendency: For now it stays where it is.

A very quick game with very simple rules and a lot of depth to its decisions. Strategy is very important, and because neither my wife nor me are prone to AP, our games usually last less than 10 minutes. Which is great, considering how little time we have due to the baby.

A great thing about this game is that it has plenty of opportunity for deeper thought than we give it, so it can be played at many levels. Sign of a good abstract.

Quoridor is a novel twist on the connection game wherein you are traveling from one side to the other with a pawn and the "connections" are barriers and impediments -- however, this is also a symmetrical game in which both you and your opponent are trying to do the same thing, all within the same game space. Here are some things that I like: 
- First things first, Gigamic makes beautiful abstract games with an old-school aesthetic. 
- Secondly, this game effectively boils down the game of cat and mouse to its bare-bones and then makes you simultaneously both.
- Third, this is not only a game of short, brutish moves (i.e., being a dick), but being a concise and cutting dick by making the most brutal move with the least moves.
- Fourth, it's incredibly short, so it's not hard to play again!

While I don't get the same abstract-tingley-feeling I get from playing a GIPF, this is an incredibly accessible abstract that is rather fun.

RATING: 7
A fair 2-player abstract. I don't play that many abstracts, and though I consider this a good game, I can think of at least 5 others that I'd choose before it. I do enjoy it on occasion though. Its very short duration bumps it up a point.

=====
2011: I'm not sure why I was so down on this game in the past. It's totally non-intimidating, unlike something like Chess or even Gipf, and its minimal rules set belies a pretty good amount of depth. Combine that with its short play time and great components, and you have a very nice abstract.

Quoridor is, without a doubt, the best recently created abstract strategy game. Gigamic has outdone themselves. Though the idea is somewhat borrowed, the concept is simple and the rules are almost insultingly simple, the depth of strategy and intuitive gameplay is beyond a first glance. This amazing game is best when played with two people.

I love Quoridor.  There is a lot of strategy in this quick game.  When I first played, I used my walls only to block the other guy.  Then I discovered that my walls could be used to block myself off, so my opponent couldn't keep me from going to his side for the win.  This is a very clever game.

Move your pawn to the other side of the board before your opponent does and slow him down by placing walls on the board. A good abstract game that takes usually under 10 minutes to play and is simple yet elegant enough not to slow down in to a brain-burn-fest.

I love 2p abstract strategy games, and the prevalence of the simple, stylish, wood aesthetic is one of the many reasons.

This game is very special to me. It requires me to think in a way that makes my brain feel the way it hardly ever feels except while playing this game. Many of the decisions you have to make feel counter-intuitive. I spent many hours playing this game and having some great people coach me on it, and improving. My history with this game is full of things I love most about gaming.

Nov08: A lot deeper than it may look.  I've only played a few times and I still have no idea how this game can play out.

It's not about moving your pawn, instead it's all about placing your walls.  And it's not about blocking the other person, it's all about stopping the other person from being able to block you.

So dang weird.  Weird in a good way, but so dang weird.

This just might be the ultimate abstract strategy gateway game. It draws onlookers because of the visually interesting board and pieces, the rules are so simple they can be explained between turns, maze-building is familiar and fun for a lot of people, the game plays quickly enough that it's not daunting to introduce, and there a surprising amount of depth emerges from the mechanics. Very glad to have this as part of my collection.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2016)

Quoridor is an abstract game and, although I enjoy some of them, I mostly don’t want to play a lot of them. I enjoyed my plays of Quoridor though.

The game can be explained under 1 minute (rules are very easy) and playtime is around 10 minutes. The game´s components are of good quality and they look great on the table (I have an old Gigamic wooden set).

The decisions needed to play the game are interesting, where to put a wall or when to move your pawn are not obvious decisions and there is a lot of tension. There is a lot of depth here! Every move you do can be countered by your opponent and a mistake will probably cost you the game!
 
For me, Quoridor is only a two player game, perhaps I could play with four players with partnerships of some kind, but not a free for all, that would remove all the strategy from the game.

Bottom line, I think Quoridor is a good abstract game, but not a game I would want to play often. I already sold my copy of the game but I´m very open to play it again if requested. I think it is a suitable game for the family.

UPDATE: This game has surprising depth for it's simplicity, far exceeding my expectations. For Go players out there this gives me some of the same joy I had when first learning that game though it's clearly not as deep it has great depth for it's complexity AND it has a tighter ruleset.

An abstract game I got for Christmas.  I'm awful at this game, like most abstract games.  I think a key is to hold onto your walls and play them later in the game once your opponent has moved forward.  It suffers from samey feel game after game.  An abstract game should have multiple good strategies and this one feels like I am doing the same moves every time.  A nice filler and the only real abstract game I have so will get play time on occasion.

Great filler for two. It's a fun and quick perfect information abstract, though I have concerns about its replayability. I get the feeling it can be "solved" if studied. Probably great for kids.

Harder to find (even online - get from BBG)

The abstract strategy game Quoridor is surprisingly deep for its simple rules. The object of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may either move your pawn or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block him off. Meanwhile, he is trying to do the same to you. The first pawn to reach the opposite side wins.

Cute little abstract game.  The limitations on completely blocking one's opponent cause this to become a game of routing your opponent through the most inefficient way possible while trying to avoid placing walls that interefere with your own route.

We found a copy of [thing=624][/thing] at a thrift store.  My wife is not a big fan of abstracts, but I thought this would be intuitive and "thematic" enough to give it a try.  

The game is an attractive wooden set and we've kept it out on our coffee table for a while.  The gameplay is deceptively simple---either move your pawn or place a wall.  The components are great in that you get the sense of physically building a labyrinth as you play.  However, despite the simple rules, the game can be difficult to play well.  You want to impede your opponent but still leave yourself a shorter path to victory, which is not easy task since you're playing on the same board.  

Predictably, my wife did not really enjoy it as it was still too abstract for her.  She also tends to dislike strong spatial games.  However, I quite enjoyed the game and hopefully it will get some more plays in the future.

Several ways to win and I don't often see draws; even though after enough plays I think there could be.

The Good: Totally unique, visually appealing, lends itself to a few strategies.

The Bad: Runaway leader can spoil the game more often than not more than half way through.

There's a very direct strategy to Quoridor.  If you place walls early and often, you'll probably do well.  If you focus on movement too much and too early, you'll do less well.  Four players offer more chaos and more 2-for-1s, but at the expense of flexibility (fewer walls per player).  In the very least, this is a very [i]pretty[/i] game, but not much else.

RATING: 7.5
Quoridor is awesome but it suffers from a really big problem: very often, sometimes as soon as halfway through the game, you can read 25 plus moves ahead to victory for one player or the other. It's a game that can be set up in such a way that one person establishes a clear winning advantage and there's often nothing the other player can do to stop it. It's quite a serious flaw, and one I find popping up between players of similar skill all too regularly. 

I don't want that to take away from how lovely I think this game is, though! The gameplay mechanics are so original, and the gameplay itself is really fun, especially if a match is arranged in such a way that things stay tight until the end. Even then, though, once both pieces are close to their opposite sides, you can just count out the spaces to victory and there's no need to finish. I don't particularly like that.

RATING: 5
Has opportunity for clever play. Pawn movement holds the whole game together, but that part is sometimes procedural/dull.

Quoridor is a half-sized [gameid=2559] in terms of squares, barriers, and pawns-per-player. It lacks start/finish squares and color-coded (axis-bound) barriers. [[geekurl=/image/636912]Photo[/geekurl]] A 5&5 axis-bound barrier adaptation seems too restrictive to me. Maybe 4&4 +2 "wilds"? I also think it might be too small for start/finish squares to be anywhere other than on the back rows.

Wow.  Gigamic games are show pieces that are so beautiful that they re pieces of art in themselve.  Inside is one of those piece and the play is fun to boot.

My favorite of the Gigamic serie.  The play is like playing cats and mouse trying to get the mouse to go where WE want.  Truly magic when the opponent takes the wrong turn and you block them with a nice palissade :-)

A very simple abstract - exactly the kind of game I suck at, and this one's no different. I get my ass handed to me. An elegant rules set and a short play time means this can be played multiple times whilst waiting for a bus. Not that I ever wait for buses.

As a caveat, I would rate this more highly if I could win it even once.

RATING: 8
After ~100 plays. My God I love this game.  It's the poster child for deceptive simplicity.  It also is extremely approachable, in the sense that new players don't feel lost, even if in fact, they are.  The concept is so intuitive that one immediately thinks of tactics and strategies to try, so that one never has that weird "playing totally blind" feeling that so often comes when one first begins to learn a deep abstract game.   

I wonder if optimal play involves a "stalemate" in which the two players move their pawns back and forth in an endless cycle, neither one willing to place walls or move very far.  The idea being that committing to a course of action gives the opponent the advantage, because only then can he block you.  I acknowledge here that I am just as likely to be completely wrong as I am to be right.  It bugs me though.  At the very least, though quoridor feels like it should be solveable it is surprisingly resistant to my (and apparently everybody else's) attempts.  It gets a really high rating until somebody makes headway there.

A friend of mine had this game, played it once and loved it. Then, with the help of an expert, made my own game. This is once of those games that takes a minute to learn but a lifetime to master. It definitely takes at least 10 games before you start to "see" the board, but as games last around 5-10 minutes that is not too hefty and investment. I love this game.

Interesting looking abstract. Will comment further once I have a few plays. And now that I have a few plays, I find this a very odd game. It's ostensibly about moving one's pawn from one end of the board to the other, but after 8 plays, most of the action seems to be about dueling with the fences. I'll need to get a lot more plays of this before I figure it out. It hasn't gripped me like Hive gripped me, possibly because I learned Hive first and I'm bent on getting good at Hive. I do think it's a very good game though.

Mindig is szerettem a logikai játékokat, ezzel pedig egy munka kapcsán ismerkedtem meg. Egyszerű szabályok, de idő kell, míg sikerül elsajátítani. Pontosabban azt mondanám, meg kell szokni, hogy érdemes kivárni. Mindig az adott helyzetre kell reagálni, előre tervezni igazán nem érdemes. Igazi vérbeli taktikai játék!

Gigamic játékról lévén szó a kivitelezés gyönyörű, jó ránézni és játszani vele.

Egyszer próbáltuk 4-en, többet nem is tervezem. A győztes kilétét az egyik játékos határozhatta meg azzal, hova teszi az utolsó falát (úgy, hogy neki mindegy volt).

A Hive egyértelműen átvette a helyét.

Simple, beautiful, and surprisingly strategic, Quoridor is a rock solid abstract game. Every game I find myself in a new situation making critically important decisions move after move. I've played this game a lot (over 100 times at least) and it seems like there's no one winning strategy. You have to think on your feet and anticipate your opponents moves. The worst thing about the game is once you've played a lot you can beat beginners every time and they will then never want to play again. What makes it great to me is how it's simple and easy to learn, but takes a while to master.

Short, abstract-y puzzle. I'm not sure if I would rank this above chess/abalone after repeated plays as I could see this getting a little stale, but I love the neat little maze concept and this things' design. I wish its pieces were a bit better and offered more replayability though, maybe with more walls/bigger room for an extended game, or more pieces for 4P/multiplayer.

I think there was a post on optimal play via mirror movement but I don't remember it. Still, neat idea for a game, and I like its theme more than other abstract games like Chess/Go/Connect Four. Its short too which is cool.

This is a really fun game!  It seems so simple - either put up a fence, or move your pawn, the object being to get to the other side first.  But with more play comes increasingly strategic moves and twists that make this game interesting.  Playing with 4 players is even more complex, which really makes it much more fun.  Overall, great, simple abstract game.

There's a fun time to be had working out all the tricks on where and when to place the maze fences. The short mail is don't bother moving until you know it's not a wasted move, ie fence your own path. A good abstract that's easy to relate to.

Simple rules that are explained in one page. Simple enough for kids, yet enough thought for adults to play along or even with other adults. Simply try and get your piece to the other side. On your turn, either move your piece (no diagonals) or place a wall, but you have a limited number of walls. Only rule is that a path to the other side must always exist. Lots of fun, plays quick, good for kids and plays 2-4. Definitely worth a try.

Otherwise it was an interesting abstract but it felt to me that from some point the game is already decided and you just have to play it until the end without any chance to change the end result unless the other player does an obvious mistake. But then again - don´t take my comment too seriously, I only played it once.

Decent cutthroat abstract game.  I love the positioning and the tougher decisions to out-think your opponent.  The rules are simpler and it's quick to play.

A beautiful game about wandering through a labyrinth you don't see yet.  A labyrinth that is built out of your own intentions and desires.  A labyrinth spun by the other inhabitants in that labyrinth, and a wall you place to foil someone else is a wall you will have to contend with later.  A game of surprises and glorious turns of fate.  Also, a game you can play with anyone, and they get it right away.  Nothing like sending that pawn forward into a wide open space you know will soon be filled with obstacles.  

The simplicity of the tradeoff between moving your pawn or placing a wall is brilliant, and woe unto you if you squander your walls too early.  Timing is everything.  Also, the single constraint that the labyrinth can never be split into two parts makes the game.  Timeless.

This was a birthday gift for me. It is a 2p abstract game of trying to get your dude across the board to the other side. You use walls to block and direct your movement or the other players movement. It is neat but I am terrible at it. My opponent, Ron, he just kills me at games like this. For now it is not a favorite. I will continue to try and win though.

Looks like a light abstract, and I suppose it is as it is very simple to teach and clocks in around ten minutes to play. But really, there's a lot of potential here for a game to grow with, so it's not *just* an accessible light game. It can be played meanly, you can really think through your moves, and it's a wonderful chance to break out your potty mouth, as you'll both be cursing one another the whole time. We talk a lot on BGG about "decision density" in some games, but what about "expletive density," huh? This would have to be up there on the Expletive Density Leaderboard.

RATING: 7.7
Abstracts are not always my cup of tea but this was a really interesting abstract. The game play can't be similar: move your pawn or place a fence.  You would first think that placing fences would be to hinder your opponent but placing fences can also help your own pawns movement and this is the key to balance when to help yourself or hinder your opponent or just move you pawn.  It almost an area control type came where you are trying to clog the leaks most successfully.  You also don't want to use all your fences until you have a finite path because your opponent can really make it hard on you.  This might be my favorite pure abstract I've played.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The basic strategy is to simultaneously create the shortest path to the other end of the board for yourself and the longest path to the other end of the board for your opponent.
There's also an electronic version available for Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quoridor&hl=nl. It's very good.

Often has surprising radical changes in the board situation due to clever wall placement.

It is best as a pure 2-player strategy game.

I've played it 4-player and found it more amusing than I recalled from long ago, despite it being less strategic and more diplomatic.  But 2-player is still best.

(Rating is for two players) Simple rules, short and tense gameplay! To discover not so obvious tactics, you have to play a number of games, and it will grow on you! As written before, seriously winnable by kids, and that is so much fun. 4-player game, due to kingmaker problems, is nothing special, a nice little family diversion (would rate a 5).

Feels like Go lite to me. People like to play pente/go-bang in between Go games, and I don't understand that, the game seems annoying and 'gotcha' style. THIS, this is what I want to play when I'm not up for a game of Go.

I like the fact that there's a guy you walk through the maze that you build, that has a video-game esque feel to me, or like a maze, or a dungeon...all good feels. So simple, so fast, so tricky. I like how it can be taught in 30 seconds.

Tough, quick abstract game. It's almost like anything you want to do, your opponent can screw it over, and you just have to hope he doesn't screw you when you most need it. Or you figure out what you can do after he screws you. Man this is tough and difficult.

The rules seem almost too loosely defined, but the elegant simplicity of the game, which results from it, is very appealing.

Quoridor -- While I'm not a fan of abstract strategy games, I must acknowledge the elegance of Quoridor.  Looks good on a coffee table, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played this exclusively as a 2P game. Players have two choices in Quoridor – either put up a wall or move their pawn. It's all deceptively simple, but there are plenty of opportunities to feint and get your opponent to use walls needlessly. It can also lead to frustrating moments when you've gone a long way around a wall only to be blocked again, but that's probably just me.

My lowish rating for this game reflects the fact that I don't particularly enjoy abstracts (I also happen to be  rubbish at this, but let's pretend that doesn't affect the rating in the least bit.) But hey, the game doesn't require any setting up and plays under 15 minutes, so it's a harmless dose of abstract fun.

2 és 4 személyes logikai játék. A feladat a figuránkkal átérni a túloldalra. Vagy lépünk 4 irányban egyet vagy elhelyezünk egy akadályt a pályán, ami két-két mezőt választ el egymástól, amin nem lehet átlépni. Teljesen elzárni az ellenfelet nem lehet a céloldaltól. Nem könnyű a helyes akciót kiválasztani és a jó bekerítő hadműveletet kitalálni. Egyértelműen ketten jó játszani, négy játékos esetében nem lehet mindenkire figyelni és inkább a szerencse dönt a győztesről. Szerencsés lett volna talán megszínezni a céloldalt a figura színével, mert négy játékos esetén a játék közepén nehéz eltalálni ki merre halad.
Nem rossz játék, csak nem az én stílusom.

[2012-04-06]
Az idei matematikaversenyen már a stratégiákat boncolgattuk az ifjúsággal. A teljesen szimmetrikusan való játék a másodhúzónak nagyon jó stratégia. Kezdőket könnyen lehet vele verni. Továbbra sem az én stílusom a játék.

This is a cute little maze game.  I like the way it works as you have to make the tough choices between blocking your opponent or moving yourself forward.

Lots of fun maneuvering as you force openings and push your opponent into longer paths.

I'm curious how the multi-player game would work.

Nice little abstract maze strategy game.  Plays in minutes, looks great, and is playable seriously or for fun, with adults and/or kids.  Simple to learn, but always a challenge to win (for me anyway).  For 2 players, some can find it a little too rigid and limiting - eg, each move is one space, each wall is the same length, synchronised move-and-counter-move (contrast the variety in a game like 'Stonewall').  With 4 players, it's more chaotic, and for me (a non-Chess buff) actually more fun - there's much less ability to control everything, and only 5 walls each to place!  A nice design, but quite good rather than great.

Math Trade prize.

I've played this with 2, 3 (it's not supposed to do 3 but we did it anyway) and 4 players.

RATING: 9
As far as abstract strategy games go, it doesn't get much better than this, in my books.  I tend to have a rather short attention span when it comes to these themeless brain exercises, but every once in a while a game such as "Quoridor" or "Hive" or "Hey! That's My Fish!" comes along with an extraordinarily simple rules set and a very short play time, and I fall in love.  In fact, even though they look entirely different, the best comparison with this game that I can make is "Hey! That's My Fish" (HTMF).  Both game scale well from 2-4 players (although "Quoridor" isn't specifically meant to be played with 3), both can be learned in less than 2 minutes and played in less than 20, and both are deliciously vicious in the blocking of opponents while trying to advance one's own cause.  "Quoridor", with it's very minimalist yet very classy design and wooden components, has the edge in terms of game design, but HTMF still maintains a slight edge as far as my personal enjoyment goes.  The only downside is that, when I play purely strategic games with my wife, she tends to win the first game and I tend to win every game after that, so she grows quickly tired of these games.  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 9/10

RATING: 8
Very fast abstract for 2/4 players; fantastic filler. 

First impressions were poor but the game improves tremendously once you figure out defensive play. Would be rated higher but the nature of the strategy (force your opponent to walk around obstacles, preferably very long and winding obstacles) can make things a little tedious.

[many plays] There is just not enough to this game.  To me it has the same sort of feel as connect 4 or something like that.  The game plays fast, if people know certain tricks they can dominate new players.  It does have some thinking.  I always feel there is like one or two key moves the decide the game that the rest is just the formality of playing it out.

Easy to learn and play. My 7 year old son instantly understood and won his first game. I can imagine two adults coming up with all sorts of interesting strategies. Not sure if more than 2 players would work as well but I'm interested in trying that.

RATING: 5
[Gigamic wooden travel (1997) edition] {Abstract, racing; only 2p/teams} Quoridor is a fast-faced abstract family game. It's not deep but it's good enough for kids. Our common trick is to close one's backyard as early as possible. It's only a 2p game: "king maker" may drive in 3-4p game. It may be modified to play as 2 teams, with 4 players, though. For me, Quoridor has a problem of low replayability. In most 2p games, the tactics and strategies are the same. It is more dynamic in 4p games but I rarely take it out for a group of 4 players :( 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pretty game, and interesting enough for its incredibly short length.  I prefer 4-player, as it's a little more unpredictable and the moves seem a little less obvious (though there is large kingmaker potential), but it's fun enough either way, and 2p it's only like 5 minutes, so.

Pros: Purely strategic. Simple to learn but endless depth behind it. And it's always fun to see what kind of maze is created at the end of the game.

Cons: Like all abstracts, no theme tied to the game. Free-for-all becomes chaotic and kingmaking.

Final thoughts: My favorite abstract game at the moment.  Looks beautiful on a coffee table. Stick with it as a two-player game.

RATING: 6
Quoridor is a pretty good two-player abstract, and quite beautiful as well.  The games do have a certain "sameness" to them though, so it's not highly replayable.  It is fast, so it is still a great filler.  The four player game is still fun and social, but it has some significant problems.  It is far too easy to gang up on a single player, and every game seems to come down to a king-making situation, that is a third player gets to definitively decide which of the leading two gets to win.

Amazingly simple, yet deep, game!  This is a great abstract strategy game.  On your turn you can either place a fence or move your pawn one space.  First one to get to their pawn to the other side wins.  Could the rules be any simpler?!  However, every game is very different as new strategies are tried out.  This is a great, fast, abstract strategy game.  And the handicapping method to allow children to compete works great too (by giving them more fences than you get).  I would only recommend it with 2 players.  3 and 4 seems pretty chaotic and are always a "gang up on the leader" game.

Quoridor is a simple yet vexing abstract game, aren’t they all. It’s simply a game of trying to get your lone pawn to the other side of the board before your opponent manages the feat in the opposite direction. On your turn you either move your pawn one space or place a wall, which blocks movement for both your opponent and yourself. Seems simple enough, but I got crushed at Quoridor twice. It was actually the new-to-me abstract game that I wanted to play again the most (more so than either Quarto or Fire and Ice) because its simplicity was intriguing. I think I’d need to be able to see further ahead to have any hope of improving at this game. It’s nice and quick, if a bit embarrassing how boxed in my pawn becomes as my opponent’s always seem to run to the goal line.

The first thing I noticed was the sheer beauty of the game itself (like all from Gigamic).  I routinely leave this one out on a table or bookshelf, and people think it's an art piece, or old puzzle, or some such untouchable.

Second of course is the wonderfully simple to learn, impossible to master game play.  

Note, FWIW, my friend who was raised in Japan said it felt very mathematical to her.  She has NEVER lost a game in about 35 plays.  My father the theoretical mathematician, on the other hand, wins about as often as he loses.

Nice little abstract with minimal rules that plays in about ten minutes. Lure your opponent to your side of the board, then close the corridor and make him backtrack half the distance.

This appears to be very similar to Cul-De-Sac (1975).  The differences seem to be:
Cul-De-Sac has two colours of barriers, one of which can only be laid horizontally, the other only vertically;
the starting positions of the pawns differ; and
Cul-De-Sac does not claim to be playable by 4.

One of my favorite abstracts, because it plays fast (because of the nature of the game, there is a maximum possible turn number) and because you can use the simple wall mechanics defensively and offensively in several different ways.  The 3 and 4 player games are flawed, this game shines only at 2.

Fun, simple abstract all about positioning. Seems idiot-level simple at first until you see a few different strategies forming. Suffers a bit from the common Abstract issue of "If he goes here I'll go here and then He'll go here and I'll go here then he'll go here" overthinking/only one viable move. Yet, one of my favorite abstracts so far. (Played on BGA)

RATING: N/A
This abstract strategy is surprisingly deep for its simple rules. The object of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may either move your pawn, or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block him off. Meanwhile he is trying to do the same to you. First pawn to reach the opposite side wins. Re-Implements: Pinko Pallino

A beautiful little maze/racing game, incredibly simple (put a wall or move your pawn) but with some deep strategy involved in the decisions. Works a little better as 2-players than as 4-players (the players tend to gang up on the perceived leader, and the one who manages to sneak under the radar tends to win).

RATING: 4
The rules are super simple. On your turn you can either either move your pawn one space or place a wall. That's it. The first one to cross their pawn to the opponents side of the board, wins.

That really is all there is to the game, but in practice, it can sometimes be a pretty good brain burner. I'm not all that into abstracts, but this one's interesting enough that I don't mind a game now and again, but no more than that...since the somewhat repetitive nature of the game's actions is a bit of a snore.

Kudos to Gigamic for sending me replacement pieces for my incomplete thrift copy!
I think I'm going to take this game off the trade market. I've played quite a few games lately and we just keep coming up with new strategies. It feels like this game has a lot of depth considering there are only two moves that you can make. Feels a lot like playing Battle for Hill 218 and constantly making new strategical breakthroughs.
I love it.

A unique game that looks great.  Plays well with either 2 or four players.  You can even play against a less experienced player by giving them a couple of your walls before the game starts.  My first, and favorite Gigamic game.

A reviewer recommended this for kids and I play it with my 5 year old. She gets 14 walls, I get 6, this means that I have to work very hard and will generally lose. My daughter loves it. Probably a 9 from her point of view.

Great family game.  We break this out all the time.  Kids love it because you can be kind of cutthroat.  They usually dump all of their fences early blocking each other...which gives me the easy win!! Huzzah :)

This is an easy game but difficult to win. With a simple rule only including going a space and building a barrier, you could be immersed in this game. This requires you to concentrate so much, sometimes this makes me angry with the fact I lost the game.
If you liked Go, I would recommend this.

8 after 3 plays.

Simple game to teach but reasonably involved in terms of strategy. Very good as a 2-player game but do not think it is suitable as a 4-player game given the huge amount of kingmaking element involved in the latter.

My version is solid wood - thought you might like to know.
Each player, in this abstract, has a set of walls and a meeple. Your quest is to reach the other the side of the gameboard before your opponent(s). On each turn, you have a simple set of choices: move meeple, or place a wall. Sounds like a bore? Wrong!

Quoridor has a just-one-more-go quality, and brainy players scratch their heads trying to beat me - thus far! I do wonder, if after 30+ plays, that the game will become a programmed experience of optimum maneuverings.

As a quick filler this is a nice game, even if it has the feel of an old Atari cartridge videogame.

Nice concept but dull execution.  I am pretty sure this is yet another game that doesn't play well if the participants are not of equivalent skill level.  I also imagine it to be fairly obvious (for most of the time) who is going to be the winner without the need to play it to the end.  There are way better alternatives for abstract strategy that I would recommend to just skip this one.

The crazy, crabby graphics of the Gigamic edition sets a frame of mind I prefer for this game:  Quick, silly competition.  This abstract strategy game is fine to play for a quick stint.  I doubt I'd ever dig it out of a closet to play, though, unless I wanted to see thos amusing graphics.  The more classical editions have always looked pretty, but the game - with four, at least - is just a brutal spitefest until people are out of barriers, allowing whoever was least abused to win.

Абстрактная игра для 2-х или 4-х игроков. Деревянное поле с клетками, по которым мы прыгаем фигурками. В границы между клетками можно втыкать дощечки - по ним пройти нельзя. Нужно провести свою фигуру к противоположному полю, не дав тоже самое сделать противнику. 

Игра требует хорошего планирования своих действий, абсолютно детерменирована, проста в освоении, но обладает высокой степенью соревновательности.

Минусы: где-то в середине на двоих уже понятно, кто выигрывает. Партия чуть дольше, чем то количество принципиальных решений, которое за её ход принимается.

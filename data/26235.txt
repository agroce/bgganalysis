A boring theme with somewhat boring mechanics does not a good game make.  It was kind of interesting how the right crate to pick was often more based on what options you were giving your opponent than what was good for you.

This is a sweet little game that plays out quite well.  the special actions will decide the game and getting them in hand at the right time to maximum effect is key.  I like the dual control of the picker - it forces the picker to move in a semi-cooperative fashion.  A nice 2-player filler.

Won in the Pick & Pack competition!  Good game - my wife really enjoys it too.  Quite a lot of depth (if you're prepared to look ahead far enough, which I'm generally not.)  Fun balance between improving your own apple crate, or wrecking your opponent's.  Or both!  Looking forward to more plays.  Thanks Simon!!!

RATING: 6
Nice 2 player game. Clear rules. No luck except in the initial placement of tiles. The game seems simple at first, and it is, but it has more depth than it looks at first sight. Since everything is open and you can figure the few next best moves of your opponent, it makes room for some deeper strategy. The abstract factor and the mechanics of the game may not be of everyone's liking though. You really don't do much in this game, you only move the "grabber" pawn, that enables you to get tiles, or if there's no tile you can execute one of the 2 possible actions still available.

Wife friendly game.
It was pleasantly easy to learn and to play.  Even though I thought I knew a good strategy, my wife managed to beat me pretty handily.  A good two player game.

Rules Notes: 
1. You CAN collect both extra turn counters before using them.
2. If you disable an apple tray, you CANNOT move onto it later.

RATING: 7
Simple 2 player game with a 6x6 grid full of apple crates and bonus tiles around the outside which you can use if you can move to a space that no longer contains a crate. 

Get more apples than your opponent to win. There's room for tactical play to try to prevent your opponent from moving to full crates or to prevent them from using the bonus tiles that could hurt you.

Quick to play as well, which is good.

Can be a AP game if you play with that type of player.

A bit of strech your luck when you want to play a actions and when you actually can play them.

Fun game that is easy to play and has simple rules, but has hidden depth to it.  The game also tends to be close and competitive.  It's over in around 20 minutes so there's plenty of time to play again.

Received this game in a math trade.  I knew the theme would appeal (pun intended) to my wife, and I finally pulled it out to play the week of Thanksgiving.  How thematic!  There's more here then the game suggests at first glance. A surprising amount of strategy and long term thought can be put into every turn.  The special tiles add an additional strategic element.  Only downside is there can be some Analysis Paralysis during each player's turn.  A good family and 2-player game. A keeper. Strongly recommended.

RATING: 4
For some reason I've always had this game on my radar, probably because of the idea of the fair grappling hook mechanism—give or take a few adjustments. It took me a long time to play the game since I learned about it, and adding insult to injury I didn't jot down my findings afterwards. At the time of writing nearly a year has passed, and all I can remember is that I thought the game a bit 'meh' and too much 'playing the other player'. In essence the fact that a weird combination of filters in my game collection showed this says it all, really. Apparently not a memorable game.

Shame, I like apples, and the idea of the grappling hooks in cardboard is creative.

RATING: 6
A two player strategy game, that is essentially an abstract with a pasted on theme. Although in saying that, the theme is pasted on quite successfully here. It's a very elegant design all over, with as few rules as possible, which is always good in an abstract strategy game. The play is very engaging and always tense, and the playing time is minimal. It's a pretty tactical game, with many crucial timing decisions. However, it is not a very deep game.

This game seems like it's interesting, but my experience with it was that you have at least 6 choices as to what you can do, and the ramification of that action could is 6 fold.  Do a couple of "I do this and he does this" in your head and it will spin.

In the end it crystalizes into a "Well look how I screwed myself" moment, where the plays are obvious and all that's left is the reckoning.

Nov08: I finally gave in and tried it.  I think the actual feel of the game was slightly unique, but much of the rest of it seemed a little light for me.

You could really overthink this one and turn it into a brain burn.  I stuck with planning 2-3 turns ahead at most.  The bonus tiles do throw a wrench in any really long term plans.

The base mechanic of horizontal versus vertical does offer some unique decisions.  But in the end, there just wasn't enough to want me to keep coming back.

Little brain-burner for two.  In apple-packing theme there is hidden almost a logic game.  I like it - fun, quick, demanding title.

And it's not as gratifying experience as I had hoped it to be...

Only online play at brettspielnetz.de. Pick & Pack feels like a reverse Rosenkönig with special actions added. As there's no random factor and all information is open, it's more thinky and a bit tiresome. For an abstract, it lacks elegance which I attribute to a mostly irrelevant setup and the various actions. I don't like that there are a few obvious moves like destroying other player's premium action and the back and forth nature of fighting for the valuable 6-apple crate. Beside that, it's an ok two-player abstract that I won't seek out to play FTF as I will prefer other abstracts like Kamisado or Ponte del Diavolo on these rare occasions.

Somewhat chess like in that you need to look ahead and consider what you're opponent might do with his options if you take this or that tile of apples.  You can also control your opponent's potential actions since s/he can only select the tiles in the column/row you leave him/her in (one person moves across, one moves up and down).

This is a fun, whimsical, chaotic game that hides a surprising amount of strategy (though not TOO much) and features a few really nifty elements. Notable among those is the restricted movement, which necessitates sitting kitty corner, not across from, your partner.

That really puts a spin on the board, and it's easy to forget which way things move. Add to that the random layout and the swingy nature of the tiles, and this could be a mess -- but it isn't. It doesn't overstay its welcome and it's fun to play.

After one play, though, it never came out again. There are lots of other games I'd rather play than this one. Got rid of it.

An engaging game that provides quite a few decisions yet keeps a light feel.  Each turn a player moves a crane and picks up apples to be loaded to one of their crates or activates an action tile (if no apples exist on the space landed on).  One player can always only move the crane horizontally, the other can only move it vertically.  You're trying to gain the most out of your action while leaving your opponent with a less desirable choice.  I look forward to seeing whether this can outlive repeated play.

Strictly two-player abstract, deterministic but with a random setup. Has a lot in common with [gameid=8203]. I guess if you really want to turn over the tiles I'm not going to stop you, but I'm not going to - let's spread em out and play. There's some interesting screwage potential built in, but if you pull the trigger too soon, it can be used against you, so the game (usually) rewards patience in a nice way. I've overcome some big deficits. I am understating the awesomeness of the timing issues.

I prefer a "purer" game like Hey! That's My Fish!, but don't forget I like HTMF an awful lot. The use of deterrents here is interesting. A nice, quick game - light but not fluffy.

RATING: 4.8
One clever mechanic (players share a pawn... one can move it horizontally, the other vertically) in search of more of a design. The fact that it's a 2P game with only one means of scoring means each move becomes pretty obvious, since to set up your opponent is suicide.  Impossible to plan too far ahead or to hide your intentions, given the limited move set. The special bonus tiles are about as silly as they usually are in this sort of thing.

My wife purchased this game for me one Xmas with the intention of getting an abstract strategy game for me and a little apple fun theme behind it for her! She likes it, but there is just something about it that doesn't get me! I will play it though! It is a little bit backstabbing, but not too bad! Make your opponents big crates of apples wholesale and small crates of apples sell at a premium! My wife finds this a beautiful game with wonderful artwork! She also loves the imaginary gripping claw that comes and collects the crates (represented by the black peg)! Who knows, maybe it will grow on me!?!

A little 2 player affair where, on a 6x6 grid, you move the shared marker up/down and your opponent moves it left/right, starting from where the other player leaves it. From the 5 places available to you from where it's left, your choice is to land on and pick up a tile containing 1 to 6 apples, or land on an empty space and trigger one of your two one-use action tiles at the end of the rows (which double points, halve points, have another go, steal apples from opponent, etc). Most apples wins. It feels a little like Rosenkonig ... you can see a turn or two ahead on what your opponent might do given the starting space you give him, and therefore what you might do after that. If you want to do more look-ahead than that, good luck to you, but that feels about right. The action tiles provide opportunities / threats which are sometimes tit-for-tat, but seem key to getting an edge. There are nice decisions to make when faced with the opportunity to take big apples but leave juicy stuff for the next play, or take a lesser haul to provide less choice for next. Not exactly a spouse game, but a decent 2 player for those who like a bit of think with no randomness, and it comes in at a good length for what it offers.

Short 2 player game with an interesting way of making 2 players share movement of one game piece, but along a different axis.

Pretty much all information is open (except apples hidden beneath the top tile of opponent's crates) which might lead to too much over-analysis. Leaving apple tiles face-down may be interesting to try.

Great components, with an insert & box that hold them well.

Pretty good two-player game. I like the action tiles, but wish they were more unique - most allow you to sabotage or take tiles.  The lids are cool, but I wish the other had more interesting actions.  If they were different, and maybe more passive, this game could be an 8. Great overall design, though.

I played this with Simon Hunt at BGG.con and found it to be a very nifty little 2 player strategy game. I don't often play this kind of game, so I don't have a dearth of experience with them, but this one was pretty clever and I enjoyed it.

Unexciting two-player game packaged ala the Kosmos small box range. The theme? The players are trying to secure tiles with apples in order to score VPs.

A random set up of 36 tiles with one to six apples (VPs) are placed on a gridded board. Players move a pawn and pick up tiles along the way. The game is a tug-of-war where you activate special tiles in order to double scoring, halve opponents scoring, take another turn etc).

The game plays out fairly quick but is lacking something special. It feels well playtested but lacks a certain spark.

The board is a grid (8x8?) with randomly placed tiles showing apple cartons (1-6; lots of 1s, just 1 6). The Picker starts on the 6 apple. On your turn you may move the picker to any other space on that ROW and take the apple there; place it in one of your 4 collection bins (fill the bins as evenly as possible, by number of apple tiles not number of apples). If no apple there, you may choose one of the 2 special-action tiles on either end of the row; if none present, game ends. The next player does the same, but moving to any space in that COLUMN. The special action tiles do a bunch of things (e.g., give you an extra action, double the value of apples in one of your collection bins, halve the value in one of opponent's bins, etc.). The player with the most apples at the end wins the game!

A light, quick 2-player filler.

Played once, but I liked that one play a lot. There's ample opportunity for clever play, but just enough chaos that it isn't completely broken down by AP (unless the players really want to). Light but not fluffy, this would have been an excellent candidate for the Kosmos two-player series.

Clever light two player game.  Even though I say light, the amount of think in this game is big for the amount of rules and teaching.  Also there is some definite meanness and screwage in this one.

06 APR 2009 - Rated 7.5 after first play with my daughter (I won by a wide margin). She immediately gave me two crates of Wholesale apples, but that let me quickly fill up my other two crates as Premium and ended the game quickly. After that happened, I saw the strategic possibilities here. I think it's deeper than it appears on the surface. 

The game looks cool (except I wish the crane piece looked more like a crane and/or claw). It's easy to teach and play although there is a slight learning curve for the special actions. Some special actions cause action 'loops' where, if I do one thing, the same can be done right back to me to undo it. Avoiding this will take more planning - I sense depth, but I need to play this more to see if my sense is correct or not.

And, setup/cleanup is a snap - the components fit into the box perfectly and cleverly - no need for baggies of any kind!

Played once. Game for two players only. Clever mechanism for moving the grabber machine. One player moves the picker horizontally and the other vertically along the grid. Action tiles make all the difference in the game, otherwise it wouldn't be much of a game. Nice, quick game.

This is an attractive not too deep abstract with a cute theme. It is getting a good amount of play. It is quick and fun. The rating will probably stay at a 7.

One of the better 2-player titles I've come across.  Since it features perfect information with a bit of a memory element splashed in, the game usually comes down to who can make better use of the claw's positioning.  Good for an occasional play or two.

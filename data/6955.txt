Played the print-and-play version with the in-laws. I recommend this - it was easy to find 8 dice and the sheets were clear. Everybody liked it and would play it again probably. This has a very high push-your-luck element that I enjoy. You can score a big fat zero for a couple events if you're too risky.

Free PnP, so why not? We've been very dicey around the house of late, so this seems a good fit. Basically ten mini dice games under one umbrella, with good push-your-luck mechanism. Fun solo, a little less so with multiple players.

Using Eric Gaudet's stellar scoresheet.

Nothing earth shattering here but is a rather "neat" improvement on something like your basic yahzhee, and has a bit of theme... which helps.

While it's all about the dice rolling it's not without skill and is pretty enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously - but you really have to accept the rub of the green when you pitch the six siders or you probably won't enjoy it at all.

Based on 1 solo play:

This is a deeply clever idea, it's just hard to imagine playing this again when there are *so many* great dice games around. Perhaps if I cared more about the theme?

I would say about half of the minigames actually provide some tense little choices (the risk of wiping out completely is great, IMO) but many events fall flat - I found the high jump and pole vault just straight-up tedious.

I also have to say the rules aren't written super clear in some instances, which is a shame for such a simple game. Took me awhile to grok the 3 attempts for the long jump, in particular.

I can't imagine this is especially entertaining multiplayer, and for solo dice fun Extra! is just far more fun for me. Shame.

This is a fun dice game - with a little bit of press-your-luck mechanic and some reasonable decision making at certain times.  It feels like it plays longer than [gameid=41], so it probably won't supplant that in terms of my favorite dice games.  But it is reasonably fun.

Best as a 2 player game? What? I don't think so. As a solitaire game to try and beat your own records it is quite a fun diversion, but to do this 2-player, nah.

I recommend this solo and 4p, best with 4+ with a maximum of perhaps 6 or so*. Not recommended 2p/3p.

*With larger groups it might be wise to break them up in equal sittings. Then wait between events and keep an overall score list. Since there is hardly any interaction, except general banter!, this works fine.

PS: I have recently made a Heptathlon variant. See the PBF posts and/or my gallery. (Need to post in the variants forum.)

If you're into dice games, you should definitely check this one out.  After all, it's free.  However, be aware that it has a significant flaw.  Basically, if you fall behind after the first couple of events, you can forget about winning the game.  It's basically impossible to catch the leader unless he catastrophically implodes on one or two events - which I've never seen happen.  So have fun rolling the dice, but don't expect much of a competitive game from this one.

Time-killing little dice game with lots of different dice mechanics. This one is an almost complete multiplayer solitaire (but you can adjust your risk preferences depending how far from the lead you are) - just like real athletics.

Duration: It's pretty fast.
Design: A variety of ways to use the dice; best played solo.
Strategy: Do not overanalyse this game, or you'll kill it.
Components: Your own dice, a printout of the rules and a scoresheet. The charm is in the minimalism.
Theme: Theme and mechanics are linked, but I always have trouble with any sports implementation other than the Wii.

Nifty dice game that lasts too long.  The easy solution is to use fewer events.  I recommend a strong and varied sexathlon(!?) of 100 Metres, Long Jump, Shot Put, 400 Metres, Discus, and Pole Vault.  With three or more players, I recommend using the medal scoring (3,2,1 points awarded per event), with total pips used only as a tiebreaker.  There's much more tension and strategy when you're competing against your opponents' scores in each event rather than simply trying to score as many pips as possible.  If you're using the medal scoring, you should rotate starting players to be fair.

I liked the different dice games, but the situation in which I experienced it tarnished them. We had a huge group of players rolling simultaneously. This not only skewed the odds, but it also removed the "push your luck" factor that would figure in when playing sequentially. Do you keep rolling to beat the player before you, or take second place hoping to make it up later?

Jan09:  Wow, that's a darn fun little game.  It's a push-your-luck like Can't Stop or Monopoly Express (Or Farkel heaven forbid).

Why is it fun?  Because each event is subtly different, offering you different choices and situations.

Also, there's actually a pretty strong tie between the theme and the mechanics for just a dice game.  I mean, it's even worth skipping heights do to a similar to real life scoring technique.

It might be a little long with more than 2 players, but you can have multiple sets of dice going.

If you enjoy these types of games at all, I highly recommend this one!

Fun little dicefest.  It's 10 different ways to roll the dice to score points.  There are a few basic mechanisms that are varied slightly to come up with the 10 events, so you don't quite have 10 totally different things to learn.  The events are surprisingly thematic, considering that it's pure dice rolling.

Very cool game that you can easily cobble together from a game of Liar's Dice and a simple printout.  Knizia excels at these simple dice games where you can push your luck at your own peril.  While not especially thematic, each event feels different enough, giving the thin veneer of theme some credibility, increasing the fun factor.

RK has been able to bring the atmosphere of many 80s and early 90s video / computer games to life with his Decathlon. Depending on the discipline you go through a quick episode of a push your luck mini game with dice. In the end you count your points total and check whether you made it into the game's all time top list or not. My personal best of 201 points has, like so many other great rumored performances in the world of individual sports, been done in training, not in the heat and pressure of a real competition.

Interesting print-and-play dice game by Knizia.  I have only played it with a group of 7 and the game lasted about an hour.

Quite fun game ("Yes!  I jumped higher than anybody else by taking risks!"), with some tension ("I hope I won't fail my attempt, this time!").  Waiting for the other players to throw their dice can be a little boring (it's hard to make much planning during their turn).

Suggestion, if the game lasts too long: "varied pentathlon of Long Jump, 400 Metres, Discus, Pole Vault, and 1500 Metres."

My rating reflects the fact that it's a lighter game, and that I'm more in heavier ones.

I introduced Carinne to this as an alternative to Farkle. It's a surprisingly thematic game and provides a nice variety to the somewhat mindless effort of chucking dice repeatedly, but I'm really not sure it is all that much better than the game I was trying to replace. As usual, "theme" lasts only a couple sessions for me, and here the game play isn't all that interesting. Some of the contests require zero decisions, and others are simple enough that you figure it out within your first couple tries. That leaves just a couple contests here that really feel intriguing. I can see myself agreeing to play this once I've forgotten the rules, so it's as if I'm trying it for the first time, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

I've only played it a couple of times solo. It would probably be much better with several people who were really into it. But I must say I truly like the clever ways Knizia has of matching certain ways of rolling the dice to certain events. 

For solo play, this is crying for an app, and I bet it would raise the rating one if not two full points. The reason is I don't like having to check the rules and roll the dice for ten events. For instance, I don't much like sitting down and playing Yahtzee, but I love the Dice with Buddies app and played 1,000 times before quitting. For me, the tediousness of rolling and writing down your score just translates well to online play.

This is a modestly thematic dice game that goes through a smorgasbord of dice game mechanics with lots of press-your-luck (the shot put was hardest for me in solitaire). It is a multiplayer solitaire that takes 10-15 minutes per player; it's probably better as a multiplayer race for score rather than as a solitaire game.

This can be a bit of fun as a time-passer for those who don't mind living and dying by dice. It's just 10 variations on rolling and freezing / re-rolling dice, vaguely simulating the features of the individual decathlon events to give it a semblance of theme, trying to get as many pips as you can with each event, adding them all up to determine a winner. But it's just rolling dice for 30 minutes. Which I didn't mind as a 2 player - we had a lot of laughs with it - but I'm not going to run around recommending it as the ants pants either.

It's no Yahtzee, but it's fairly quick.  I need to look into my copy of Decapeg to see if they are similar.  This game could use a little fatigue rule concerning the jumping events (high jump and pole vault).  There is no penalty for trying at every level, but in the real world, the more attempts you make, the less effective you are in the next event(s).

RK's Decathlon is a fun push your luck dice rolling game you can obtain for free on Dr. Knizia's website.  All you need are 8 six sided dice, the rules, and preferably the really cool score sheets you can find in the game's file section on BGG.

We typically play with a group of four but the game could work for any number, really.  Each of us chooses a country and we play the national anthem of the winner's chosen country at the end.  Its been a hit with my young boys, and its FREE.  Why are you still reading this?  Free game! Go get it and try it out :)!

Kind of fun pure dice game.  The mechanisms do a good job of simulating the different Olympic events, but there's not much of a game here - it's mostly just chance with a little push-your-luck. Feels very much like Knizia experimenting with various possible permutations of how to roll and freeze dice.  My wife said it reminded her of the old 80's button-masher Olympics video games. I would recommend getting a bunch of small d6's, so every player can have their own set of 8 and play simultaneously or near-simultaneously, as it is pretty boring to just watch other players roll.

Végtelenül egyszerű, taktikázós, néha nagy kérdések/döntések elé állító bemelegítő játék, amihez 8 dobókockára, papírra és ceruzára van szükség mindössze. Unaloműzésnek kiváló, akár egyedül is.

It is fancy Yahtzee, but on the heals of the '08 Olympics it feels very timely.  Needs to be played with several sets of dice so it can be played head to head.

RATING: 7
Played it today with 5 players: 4 adults and a child of 8. It was a blast. We had so much fun! The recipe for it being fun is to play very fast. Not think, just roll, young Jedi. And pass the dice quickly to the next player.

The different ways to roll the dice for each discipline are very thematic (only two of them are too similar).

This game and King of Tokyo (with the first expansion) are my favorite dice games.

This is an okay game. The theme adds flavour to the plain push your luck mechanics; and it also brings a sense of cohesiveness to the 10 variations by making similar competitions have similar mechanics. The game can pass the time enjoyably when played solo but is more enjoyable when played with two. Even at that number, however, it can run a bit long, so I'd recommend only playing it with more players if everybody gets a set of 8 dice. Also, keeping track of records between sessions sounds like an excellent way to add some extra spice to the game.

Reiner Knizia's Decathlon -- Played once; three-player.

A repetitive series of simplistic dice rolling exercises, Reiner Knizia's Decathlon takes far too long to play considering it's lack of substance.

While we did enjoy ourselves, the tenuous relationship between each dice challenge and its corresponding Olympic event wasn't enough to keep our interest.

This dice game is a mathematical joy and a blast to play with friends.  With multiple press your luck mechanisms and competitive scoring, everyone is involved throughout the game, even when not rolling.  Add in the portability of this game, and it takes the gold medal!

I created a boxed version for the game, including two sets of Olympic-colored dice, a hand tally counter, and medals to distribute after each event.  Then I gave them out as gifts for Christmas!

RATING: 6
Wow, what a great dice game. MUCH better than Yachtzee, in my opinion, not that they are especially comparable. With eight dice, players play eight different mini-games, trying to roll up the best scores in the 10 events of the Decathlon. Mostly luck, but lots of push your luck! This game is great for passing some time rolling the bones. Recommended.

This isn't a bad little game when played 'competitively' against others. It can be played solo as a 'try to get the highest score' challenge, but I don't find any enjoyment in that. While it is very mathy, I don't find that to be a negative when playing it against people as there is an element of trying to beat them, not just do better than the average score in each event.

Similar to Yahtzee, this game is a series of 10 rounds of rolling dice with different scoring criteria that is supposed to represent an athletic decathlon.  Completely random minus some choices on which dice to keep/re-roll (just like Yahtzee).  I suppose there are worse ways to spend some free time but there are certainly much better as well.

RATING: 6
[Free print-and-play game] {Sports, dice; dice-rolling, multiplayer-solitaire} It is a fun dice filler.  I admire how Knizia can design dice games.  This game has minimal player interaction; thus, it is best played with 32 dice for 4 players.  It is fun and dynamic.  Players are yelling and screaming for the dice; esp. when they miss the Long Jump / Discus / Shot Put / Javelin after all 3 attempts :( This game is nice!

Entertaining little dice roller.  Not too much meat on the bones here.  May never play again.  One Sheet of paper and some dice.

Update : Ok, my wife is out to get me in this game.  I am undefeated.  The dice do not love her. It seems it has turned into something we play.

How many different ways can we come up with re-rolling and push your luck? 9? Hmm, rewrite one and use odd numbers instead of even and we have decathlon.

It's almost entirely luck driven but is fairly fun, no more, no less.

I'd love to print out a little travel copy, with cards and little dice and a mini dry-erase marker.  Until then, I've written down the instructions and have enjoyed several games with a variety of people.  There's enough control that it's hard to feel like a victory or loss was undeserved, and the mini-games combine nicely into something surprisingly evocative.  One of my current favorite games in the 30 minute range.
Go contribute to the World Records thread!  It's fun!

I like Yahtzee variants, as well as Yahtzee itself, but this game was a little flat for me. I think the very first plays were neat, but it doesn't take long before the novelty is gone.

What do you expect for a simple, free game.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

Decent filler type game.  Incredibly light, but enjoyable.  One play.  Curious to see if there is hidden depth and shrewd decision making can mitigate the luck of the dice.  There are  decisions, so more plays to hash it out are necessary to determine if they are meaningful.  It is possible to be out of contention pretty early.  Its length/decision ratio knocks it down a few points.  Wanting to try this as a side game, for a longer type game with downtime.

This is enjoyable as a puzzle.  I find it interesting to try and understand the best tactics to maximize score, but I find the decisions in the game itself rather pedantic and unexciting.  Yahtzee, because it has more decisions, is more interesting.  Can't stop is much more interesting.

My 10yo daughter, however, cannot play this enough.  I just told her she could play solitaire.  I'll see how much she plays now.

Steve Sisk was kind enough to share his amazing color score sheets he made using Eric Gaudet's terrific score cards as a template. I laminated the sheets and use a grease pen to mark them, which can be easily erased with a tissue.  I found that I can store the game nicely in my Deluxe Yahtzee nylon zippered case along with Farkel, and Cosmic Wimpout.  A box full of push your luck fun which is compact and rugged.

Kinda neat, but I can't really think of a time I'd rather play this than [gameid=2243].  Yahtzee has the advantage of being familiar and easy to teach for non-gamers, as well as a better tension throughout the game.  This one's fine light fare, but really isn't all that interesting.  Not really worth it for gamers, and not really worth teaching to non-gamers.  Decathalon theme is thin but present, especially in the similarity between events of the same type.  I probably will never play this again, and that's A-OK with me.

Neat!  There are a lot of different little variations on the same theme, that actually make sense when you look at them in the sense of the sport they represent.  It's still pretty much a game where you want to roll the highest or lowest, but the use of 1s and 6s as fails or negative points, respectively, mix up the game enough to keep it interesting.  It might make a better solitaire game than a multiplayer game, since there's no real way to interact with the other players.

Good game for what it is.  Lasts a little long, but it's as thematic as you could possibly imagine a game representing Olympic sports with only 8 ordinary dice.  All of the running events feel similar, all of the jumping events feel similar, and all of the throwing events feel similar.  The jumps are even conducted in a format similar to their Olympic counterparts.  Overall, a fun game.  Not one I'd want to play everyday, and not fast enough to play multiple times in a sitting, but definitely one I'll play again.

I don't understand why you would ever skip heights in the high jump or pole vault.  Otherwise a good collection of dice games.

Edit:  I read a few strategy articles and tried skipping heights.  It still doesn't make intuitive sense, but I think I understand why.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that my scores in those events have improved quite a bit.

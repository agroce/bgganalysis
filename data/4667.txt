I like that this is essentially a miniatures game with a bit of card play . The artwork is outstanding. The game system is rock solid with a nice variety of units and the ability to bluff. Underappreciated probably due to the original collectible elements. Just buy the complete "bronze" edition and enjoy a fine game.

Easily the best of the four Columbia card games. The Quatre Bras game is a great classic in a pint pot. Five-position Waterloo also works extremely well. This demands house rules, and ours are in the files section.

The individual battles are fun to play with lot's of tactical options, but the campaign rules doesn't seem to be worked out well. You'll easily have too many cards in your hand.

The long range artillery does do too much damage. It is fighting without taking risks.

I also wish there was a possibility to create additional positions at the flanks.

An additional .5 for the beauty of the cards.

Not one of Columbia's better efforts IMHO. It basically takes the tactical combat system from Napoleon and soups it up a bit, but there is a reason that is the subgame and not the main event. Of the lite, wargamey card games, far from the worst but nontheless not a lot to recommend it.

Simple game of attacking and defending areas of the battlefield. Lose one of them and the battle is lost so every move counts and every dice roll. Beware the bad hand syndrome as that can make for a very short game. 1 Play.

RATING: 6
Nice authentic-looking cards - I ordered the bronze set which apparently was unavailable and so was sent the silver - kudos to Columbia. Unit morale is too low though in some cases imo. Play with an expanded (5 area width) board and adapt the "Dixie" outflanking rules to improve tactical challenge, particularly in the "Waterloo" scenario. The campaign option really doesn't work - play this as a single battle experience. Light fare but fun.

Own this and all 3 games in Dixie series: Bull Run, Gettysburg & Shiloh. Easy to play and gives a feel (albeit abstracted) for the linear tactics of the era. Cards provide good insight into the leaders, units and terrain at the various battles.  Rules enhancements (versus Dixie series) come closer to replicating some aspects of Napoleonic warfare, particularly infantry formations & effects of/on cavalry.

Two plays of Quatre Bras on the 199th Anniversary. 1st game was a very quick win for the Anglo-Allied who were able to take control of the French Right flank with little effort for the win.

2nd game saw some fierce fighting for Gemincourt and then Quatre Bras itself. Finally after much fighting the 1st Regiment of the Line were able to oust The British from the buildings and the position fell to the French not long after. Some epic moments in particular the Red Lancers cutting down Wellington who was trying to bolster the Anglo-Allied left flank at Cherry Woods! Great couple of games that have got the 199th Anniversary off to a good start.

200th Anniversary Games
Quatre Bras 16/06/2015
Anglo-Allied held out and then took Gemioncourt from the French. Close call but an Anglo-Allied saved the day and Wellington and Blucher get to do it all again in a couple of days.

Waterloo 18/06/2015
Epic Waterloo using all the cards and playing with them in their semi-historical positions. French came on strong and managed to rid themselves of both Picton and Wellington early in the battle. D'Erlon attacked the Ohain Ridge in strength and Papalotte also came under extreme pressure. The 
Allied left flank almost caved in with a huge push by the French but they held just long enough. The tide swung and the Feench had to fight a defensive battle thereafter. The Prussians made the presence known and Plancenoit finally fell to them late in the day. At the same time the allies having secured the field assaulted and took Braine L'Allaud. What a game. Took a very long time to play but it was a good'un. A lot of key leader deaths via artillery strike early on made a big difference.

Can play this as it historically developed; i.e. Ligny, Quatre Bras, Wavre, Waterloo.  Additionial Battle tactics, that the 'Dixie' series did not have; Squares, Line/Column etc.

Very clever system where you try to 'break' one of your opponents three columns.  Never ending variation in setup and results.

I never heard of this strange collectible card wargame before playing it. We were three and split the England/Prussia force into two. I played Prussia or at least tried to. Prussia only can get active in the Waterloo scenario when it draws a general and I didn't draw one for 11(!) turns. But even when played as intended this game is passed by time. Games like CC:Ancients share the same tactical core of battlefield action divided into three areas while packing much more punch in the same time with less complexity. The most disgusting part of Columbia's unsuccesful (?) take at milking the CCG train is that each card exists in a gold (Rares - 10% of each card), silver and bronze version which doesn't have any effect on gameplay. 15 years after release complete gold decks are still sold at the Columbia website for $299 while a simple bronze deck retails for $49.

Very nice cards, the rules do a good job of incorporating line, column, cavalry, etc. for a nice tactical rock-scissors-paper Napoleonic feel.  I have never been fond of the draw two cards each turn and see what you get idea of this game, and Dixie.  That works OK for Quatre Bras, but for Waterloo and Ligny, which were set piece battles, it doesn't make a whole lotta sense.  What I did was simply take the cards which were present at the battles, set up the terrain in 5 columns, and have at.  Each turn was a half hour, and I threw in a variable entry for the Prussians who formed a sixth column upon their arrival.  It worked very well.

Played 20+ times. Wow, it´s a card game and a historical simulation. A much too rare combination. A nice change from hexagons and an instant hit with all I played it with. It actually teaches you a lesson or two about Napoleonic tactics. Wavre becomes unhistorical, however, because the game makes the French want to sit back and wait for reinforcements while the Prussians want to attack before the French become too strong.

Dalgliesh, 2-p.

RATING: 9.9
My favorite Napoleonic warfare game. The card art really brings this game to life in a way counters or blocks never can. This is my altime favorite card game art! I love how the locations are somewhat random but are still placed in the correct Historical relationships to each other.

The moral system is what makes this game great. Each hit is another moral check for that unit so elite units can hold the line against overwhelming odds and each moral check is tense and exciting. For some reason the ending conditions for this game are more satisfying then any other combat game I have played.

The randomness of when a unit breaks and when it stands it's ground is frustrating in competitive play but it works really well in solo play.

Only play solo these days...

An expansion of the combat system in Napoleon The Waterloo Campaign. Essentially a card game, and you place cards in reserve, right flank, left flank, or center. For my taste more complexity than is helpful. It's great if you are into historical uniforms and units that were at Waterloo.

I loved the Dixie system and Eagles improved it. The small battle Quatre Bras is the most luck dependent since there are fewer combat unit cards. I made the mistake of using at as teaching scenario. One guy drew all units and the other mostly Generals and sSpecial cards. A very short engagement ensued and I failed to recruit a couple new players. 
The "collectible" colorings of Gold, Silver and Bronze trim was probably ill considered though. It did not improve the collectiblilty for me. I was frustrated to buy a 60 card deck and get two identical cards but one is "GOLD". It just made it harder to get a complete set. Oh yeah, I was trading and selling cards all over the country when Columbia released complete sets leaving me hanging with about 1000 cards and a lot less traders and buyers. Need some cards?

This is an ignored gem.  For us, it worked VERY well as a stand alone game, but by "stand alone", I mean having the full set of cards and playing it as a "pure game", ignoring the Napoleonic context.  You must approach this game more from the mentality of Poker than that of a wargame.  It helps that we play this deliberately wrong: hide the card formations UNDER the cards (historically inaccurate, but an absolute blast to play!)  With the proper mentality, there is an amazing depth and variety in the 4 different scenarios, and an exciting and varied experience even playing each scenario many times through.  For even more variety, try playing scenarios with double or half card numbers/reinforcements.  Of course, by today's eurogame standards, this game is far too complex for what it offers, but for the time, there was nothing like it.  By the way, it's not entirely obvious how to convert the game from the larger scale block game: we get the feeling that it was never playtested, although it's not hard to derive house rules that will work.

I really love this game system.  It's an elaboration of the battle system found in Napoleon: The Waterloo Campaign.  Unfortunately, it works really well there because it is not the entire game.  When taken out of the campaign context it loses some of its luster and its simplicity isn't enough to hold my interest.  

I would like to try a game of Napoleon where these cards are used in lieu of the blocks just to see if the melding to the two systems makes a better game or just a more complex one.

There are some moderately interesting things going on in Warlock.  Chief among these is the possibility of using each card in several ways: to mine for gold, as a builder of your city, as a building in your city, or for its special power.  There's a touch of interaction in the form of powers that enable you  to swap cards with another player or destroy a bit of their city.  Beyond that, there's an abstract-ish element of playing cards in certain positions in your city or in a chain and an element of set collection to gain majorities. And yet the three rounds of the game feel over-extended as somehow it just lacks a spark of originality, drama, fun or something.

The artwork is bog standard fantasy, while some of the iconography and the teeny tiny print on the player aids are difficult to read.

First played this game with a quick explanation of the rules. Probably to quickly for us, as you have to learn the features of the different characters. Once you know what action you can make with this or that card, it becomes real fun. 
You have a lot of possibilty's with the characters and the point is, that you have to search for the best strategy. 
In the beginning a bit hard to play without knowing the characters well, after a second reading of the rules, a game where everybody was enthousiastic. On the list of games whe should play more often.

There's a lot going on in this game : Different possibilities with the cards, good idea of four functions for the castle, the powers of the fantasy figures, the scoring of the points etc....
So a good change for a high score : but for one reason or another this game plays just not fluent enough to hit the table often. The game falls a bit in between : too long for a filler, too short for a decent game.
Nice coincidence : the artwork was made by a guy from Veldegem, the place where our gaming club (Spelen op Zolder Zedelgem) was founded.

Read the rules.  Looks like a medium/medium-light hand management, tableau building special powers card game.  I think it'd be interesting but nothing particularly innovative.  If it comes to the States at a decent price point, I might pick it up.

I find it difficult to form any sort of coherent thought or conclusion about this game. Other than that I find the graphical execution to be a hindrance rather than an asset, that is, so let's start there and see where we end up.

First problem really is the damned small requirements for building cities. Second problem is that if you place cards in your dungeon, the overlap will cause obscuration of the most important piece of card estate: the person. So you end up with a messy stack of cards in that position. The same issue plagues how you hold the cards in your hand. Third problem is the colour of the shields which can only be told apart with some difficulty. From a distance you can forget it, but this is precisely the kind of information you need for Orcs and Wizards to work to their full extent. The result is a lot of unnecessary moving and peeking which definitely hinders quickly formulating a plan of attack.

But once you try and start formulating such a plan there doesn't seem to be much to do besides optimising what you were given in your hand, and suffering the occasional Orc or Wizard attack from other players. This means collecting a few cards, dumping them in the dungeon (or occasionally in the castle), and then finally moving out a card to the empire of cities. There are a few VP-related rules active here which cause a spot of tableau building, but overall this part of the game is weak compared to genuine tableau builders (Tournay, Glen More). Dragons are an absolute necessity here, but for the life of me I can't understand why anyone would not always arrange these beasts in the pattern which guarantees maximum protection (which would leave 4 fields unguarded). Perhaps that advanced Warlock-players are able to pump out human cities to such a quick extent that they are able to force the game to an end before attacks take their toll, I wouldn't know... but how cards enter your hand seems to forbid such an approach before it has a chance to come to fruition. All in all the game seems more about arbitrary set collection than clever hand management.

So yes indeed, the game offers four (!!) (!!!!!) different ways to use any card. But in practice you will try to arrange it so that particular cards end up in particular locations, and that diminishes the four-way use; put another way, the game to some extent decides for you what needs to be played where. That, and that the artwork is lacking, leaves behind an impression I'm not keen on experiencing anew any time soon.

It's a strictly mechanical card game, almost a puzzle game as you build a 4x4 grid of cards for optimum points.  At a high level, it reminded me of Vikings a little bit.  The mechanisms work well together, without being particularly original.   There is strictly no theme, but the dated 70s style fantasy artwork was a nice diversion.  The production is quite problematic.  Printing is dark, cards are very small, the colors are hard to distinguish (esp. Blue/purple and red/brown).   If you can forgive all of that, the game play is pretty engaging.  Low luck, low down time, plenty of forward planning.  Some attack elements can be strong but the dragons provide a ton of defense against that avenue of play.

Hi geeks, I designed Worlock so maybe it is not appropriate to rate it. But since I started reviewing games 7 years ago - I reviewed about 700 games now - and because I want to ad some comment, I decided to give it a shot.
I played Warlock (and the prototypes) more than 100 times and I still like the game very much. That's why I rate it a 9. But as I mentioned I am the designer so I am not absolutely objective.
Warlock is a city building game in a fantasy setting. Different creatures have different powers and skills to help you build your empire. So do NOT expect a fantasy war! Each card shows a creature and a city. In your turn you decide how to use the card. Send the creature to the mines to collect gold, put it in your dungeon to use it as a worker or set it free to use its special power. If you want to build the city, place the card in your empire and discard the needed workers. 
Warlock is all about doing the best you can with the cards you receive. Think in advance to build your strategy. Destroying an other city is only useful if you profit from it big time. Otherwise you just lose an action. Warlock demands a constructive way of play. 
In Warlock there are 6 different races, each with an power and skill and there are different things you have to keep in mind when building your empire. That's why the first game can be a little bit overwhelming. Most players (learned in Essen) need 3 rounds to get into the game. The more you play, the more you discouver new strategies.
For the artwork of the game we chose to use oil painted pictures. So each card, each board is in fact a scanned painting. I really love the artwork. Espacially the details in growing cities. ofcourse that is just my opinion.  
The size of the cards was chosen 6 by 6 because everything has to fit on a normal table. I've noticed that some players had difficulties to recognize the difference between the colors of the symbols whe used. I think the problem solves itself when you are used to playing Warlock.
The rulebook is not faultless, there I could have done a better job. 
But I am convinced that Warlock is a great game that certenly is worth its price.
Since this is my first game and I am eager to learn, Please at some comment to your ratings.
Kind regards
Fabrice

I really want to like this game more. It's an interesting design, claiming to be an attempt at "making cardgames luckless".
You're enslaved evil monsters, tasked with establishing an empire for your master. Enslave the locals, put them to work and just get on with it already. You've got three days.
The game shines in the interactivity with the other players. Yet this is also the game's downfall. After all, it's VERY mean. I'm talking about "people losing half their point total by the time it's their turn again"-level of mean.
Also, bad artwork, graphic design and... mediocre to bad rulebook.

Oh, the bidding has a really cool rule though where you can't duplicate exact bids. Sounds weird if you haven't played the game but yeah, really cool.

Warlock could be a decent or even a good game with couple of nice ideas, but its graphic design is beyond awful. I don't mind the retro amateur fantasy art (not that I like it either), but information is presented in such a hard to read way that playing the game becomes next to impossible: icons are tiny, colors are muted and irritatingly difficult to tell apart under the best of lighting conditions, texts use established boardgaming terminology in a non standard way, vital information is divided between several tiny cards, etc. 

If there ever is a new version with clearer graphics, I'll try Warlock again.

Tableau building card game with a significant amount of "take that" elements. Neat idea to incorporate multiple functions in a single card. Not my favorite style of artwork, though.

RATING: 5
I think there is a quite potential game in here, but now the experience is ruined because of the bad usability issues: used colors and graphics (and I mean those icons, which are important for playing) are too tiny and fiddly. Hope they will improve the design more because as I sayd, there is some potential.

Warlock is a great game.
I've played it several times now and the more you play it, the better it gets.

The first time I played it with people who don't play very often and in the beginning they were a little overwhelmed but after two rounds everyone was in the game and we all liked it.

Every card offers four bossibilities so you can't say you've got the wrong cards. I don't like games where the outcome depends on luck.

Also the fact of interaction (swapping and destroying cities of other players) makes the game interesting from the beginning till the end.

Played this game for the first time. As often, in the beginning, the rules seem not so easy, but after 2 rounds of play, everything was clear - except the strategy ;-) Every participant played on his own, learning the game. But it's clear that Warlock is a very "rich" game with some original mechanisms. Little downtime, a lot of ways to win the game and tough decisions. Once you understand the 6 characters, the game flows...

More confusing than it should be due to poor symbology and overcomplicated steps, but once you get through a game it's very playable. I like most of what's here but the take-that elements are not only annoying but also seem to be a dominant strategy, which drags this game down for me.

Interesting card game that uses the tableau building mechanic with some take that and quite a bit of leader bashing. Decent enough, but the graphic design is poor and doesn't entice players to play the game. The game is better than it looks - that should say enough... The game also seems to take too long for what it is.

A card game where each card has four purposes. A card can have a value in money, in raw materials for city building an effect when discarded and it can be a built city.
The rules are not really easy to digest but if you come through you will see a really nice card game. There can be some take that in the game as one of the actions is destroying a city. Another action is swapping a city of an opponent with one of yours.

Very underrated game.

This game feels so fresh and different than your conventional tableau builder. 

Rules are quite simple to learn, but so deep in terms of strategies. The flow of the game is unorthodox, but very pleasant.  

Regarding the artwork, I find it unique and very nice. It definitely makes his charm. There's some take that mechanic in the game, but you can protect yourself with the dragon in your city, so you have to prioritize which cards to build, so tough decisions throughout the game. 

A Real gem !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I think the artwork style is a weird choice but it's consistent. Maybe it's just the lackluster fantasy theme that turns me off. Makes you think the game came out in 1985, which would be fine if it was the case, but unfortunately this a 2013 game. Their is really no excuse for the graphic design in this day and age.

For me the game suffers from being compared to better multiple use card game like Glory to Rome. Each cards really has a single use with additional power tacked on so it doesn't get stuck in your hand. The touted multiple path to victory is really a lure. Having 6 different colours in your city give lots of point so everybody need to shoot for it, having 3 dragons is a necessity as interaction is pretty direct and brutal, majority aren't all equal so it seems wizard/giant majority will determined most game, etc.

You can feel the love and development behind the game, but the interest to play again is just not there.

RATING: 6.25
While it does have a lot of neat things going on (cards can be used in many ways), the "take that" part of the game is a bit much for me. It can be mitigated and played without it, which would probably increase my rating to a 7, but it still feels a bit clunky. Can be fun though and is pretty quick and light so if you're in that mood it isn't a bad game, just nothing amazing either.

I never knew what to expect from this game. I'm not a fan of the art style and I had heard there was some take that involved, which didn't help peak my interest. Turns out that take that element isn't very big and usually not to the benefit of the one executing it. I must also say that some of the choices design wise where not optimal. The way in which you can tell which of the types the second type on a gonome card is. It's always in a different spot an not always prominently featured. It's also kind of stupid that with 5 players there might not be enough cards in the deck to finish the game, in which case everyone must give up some of their cards. That's kind of a forced fix. But in the end it didn't matter too much I think. The game moves fast enough and has a nice mix of strategy and tactics.
All in all a pretty decent game that doesn't really stand out.

Provisional rating, one incomplete play (at Spiel). I like games in which I manage a hand of cards to order to build a high-scoring tableau - they appeal to something in me that likes to build things.  It's then dissatisfying when a game, such as Warlock, allows other players to mess with that tableau, i.e. not making the task more skilful but taking away its purpose.  The dragons mechanism provides protection at a cost, but I would have preferred the designer to have found a more subtle means of interaction.

Besides its strategical mechanism, one thing I love of this game is its old-fashioned design like a classic fantasy 80s game. Nowadays there aren't a lot of them. And, despite first games you are overwhelmed, Warlock carries on making you think everytime when you have got used to it and flows. That are why this is one of my favourite games.

So I think his artwork is very suitable, full of contrast between its colors.

The system is solid (Eastfront proves that), but the application just does not work.  This one is a bit dull.  The Axis are going to lose, just how badly?  Also, while the rules are written well, the scenarios are written horribly.  Seriously, I spent longer trying to figure out how to set up and play a scenario than I did reading the rules.  I suppose if you tied it to the other games in the series and played the monster, it would work in that context, but by itself, it just does not.

Replaced by Westfront II.  You can play this on its own, however it's much more static that Eastfront.  Towards the end of the war the Germans really to become a punching bag as it becomes more and more expensive to rebuild their HQs.

The gameplay starts in July '43, and Germany is not allowed to invade Africa or Britain so their options are limited.

I think that many people purchase this as a companion to Eastfront so that they can play Eurofront.

I don't normally play this as a stand-alone game, it gets used more as part of a EuroFront (nee MasterFront) game, but it is still fun as is.  The Overlord scenario can be a blast.  As of Jan 2005 CG is planning to release a North Front that will extend the map of England making Operation Sea Lion more viable, so owners of West and North Front can take turns invading across the English Channel in both directions!

Not *quite* as good as EastFront, but still underrated I think by fans of the system. Let's not forget that German defeats in Normandy were almost as catastrophic as those in the East in terms of manpower destruction and economic loss, it's not like the West was a sideshow. There is plenty going on here and lots of choices, and the whole system still work brilliantly. Lacks the broad sweep of EastFront, of course, so you'd probably play that first by choice just from the gaming perspective, but this of the same caliber and worth your time.

The war in Western Europe from 1943 - 1945. Scale is grand strategic, with the blocks representing armies/corps. Similar to its elder cousin EastFront, it uses the same ruleset but adds rules for sea movement. If you want to start "Front"-Blockgaming, get EastFront first. It is less complex (no sea rules) and plays more fluidly. Combined with EastFront for a game of MasterFront starting in 1943, it really shines!

The companion game to EastFront, involving the invasions of Italy and France.  The game system is identical to EastFront but the fluid movements and sweeping advances are missing due to the tougher terrain.  Still, if you enjoy EastFront, you&#039;ll want this one.

Sadly, I have to echo conventional wisdom that this game is not as good as EastFront, but that is still saying that this is a great game. It loses out to EF mainly because the scenarios in WF tend to be less dynamic, with Germany on the defensive most of the time. Not that it makes the Allies' job easier. The logistics rules, particularly on Sea Invasion are simple yet they express themselves in very challenging ways in the game. Very impressive game.

RATING: 7
The younger brother of EastFront. It has less movement and breakthroughs than EF since the terrain is much more closed. The new rules are a mixed bag.

The luck plays a bigger role since there are fewer units and paratdrops and invasions are critical but are done with a few dice roll.

I find it strange that too "many peices" is a critism for this great "classic" war game. As war games go, this is a twin to Eastfront, acclaimed as one of the best WWII games on the market.  In many respects this takes AH's various attemts at WWII conflict and puts it in the hands of novice and expert alike.  Don't poopoo this game away because of its 30 pages of rules or 120 block units... this is a great game and very playable.  If you played Wizard Kings / Victory / Hammer of the Scots, you'll find it a bit "old" since CG hadn't come out with the A/B/C fireing clasifications.  But if you know them this will only take one read to understand.  Buy it! Not at $60, but look for a deal of say around $40... it's worth it.

Very Good: Strategic - WWII - Easy/Medium

See Eastfront / WestFront II

As stand alone game i rate it 8, in combination with Eastfront it is a 9); interesting to try out the strategic options for the Allies. However in combination with Eastfront this game absolutely rocks (see EuroFrontII). Unfortunately time and space are constraining factors at the moment but I'm planning to fight yet another krieg and will play it beyond the fall of Berlin; stopping the Russian steamroller from entering Paris....

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, however the 4 hour playing time is for just one scenario. Playing the whole game from 1943 onwards will likely take up to 18 hours. Designed to link with EastFront. As such the hex grain and time scale are too gross to properly represent actions in this theatre. Optimum play for the Germans (who are Production-starved) is to do as little as possible -- not a recipe for fun play. Clearly the only reason that this game exists is to dovetail with EastFront. It is not very good as a stand-alone game.

Under-rated.  Whereas EastFront is Beethoven, WestFront is more like a Mozart in that it&#039;s a more chess-like, cat-and-mouse experience than it&#039;s &quot;bigger brother.&quot;  By giving players the entire western European theater and the Med., it does a far better job than other games focused on this theater in depicting the full range of considerations both the allies and axis had to ponder when deploying forces in France, Italy, and the Balkans.  Starting in 1943 is best in that the Germans have a lot more fun in the early going than they do in &#039;44 when allied airpower shuts down their ability to move from front to front.  Moreover, it gives the allies an intriguing set of decisions to make - hitting Italy is safest, southern France a bit more dangerous but perhaps more promising in the long run, the Balkans are high risk due to the &quot;blitz invasion&quot; necessary, but usually lightly defended and, if you get established there, you&#039;ve got a great shot into the German heartland.  And then there&#039;s an early invasion of France possible.  The fog of war provided by the blocks really shines in this game - perhaps too much!  If the allies invade a fully stacked fortress, they&#039;ll usually disintigrate ... but would the allies really have been that clueless regarding German defenses?  The only reason I don&#039;t rate this game higher is the grim and grueling fate that awaits the German player in the summer of &#039;44.  You can&#039;t hardly move your divisions, you can&#039;t hardly rebuild losses, it&#039;s hard to maintain HQ points, and all you really end of doing is covering up on the ropes an pray for the bell.  At least, that&#039;s how it feels to me - others have told me that actually enjoy such torture!  This isn&#039;t the game&#039;s fault, however - it&#039;s the nature of the campaign WestFront so excellently simulates.

A very good game of WWII in the West from '43-45.  Although it uses the same rules as EastFront, it plays very differently.  The Axis and Allies play very differently as well.  The Germans have a large force but it is largely static.  As such, the Germans must preserve HQ points and wait for the decisive attack by the Allies.  The Allies have lots of HQ points but a relatively small force.  They need to leverage the Germans out of position using their superior mobility on land and sea.

If you're trying to decide whether to get this or EastFront first, [b]get EastFront,[/b] even if (as for me) that part of WWII is uninteresting to you.  This is either just as badass, or [i]almost[/i] as badass, as EastFront, but the sea control rules (which you can mostly ignore in EastFront) make this less easy to pick up & play.  (I would have given up halfway through the map & rules errata if I hadn't already been blown away by how cool EastFront was.)

Played once at a friend's in combination with eastfront as a 3 player. Worked well save that we made a mistake on the defensive terrain rules that made breakout in Normandy impossible, and yet this mis reading helped the Soviets blunt a German counterattack in the east and eventually left them poised to take berlin when we ran out of time. Would probably prefer to play Europe Engulfed for the higher level of resolution.

Mine is a minority opinion, but I enjoy this game every bit as much as the more popular EastFront, possibly because I find the subject matter more interesting.  Fascinating strategic choices for both sides, and a very strong historical feel.  The Axis are on the back-foot throughout, of course, but get some opportunities for counter-attacks in between being ground away.

Well, a sequel from the "perfect" Eastfront. The big difference between them is the intensive use of invasion, sea assaults and beach heads, logically from the kind of front allied had to manage. And this is a problem, especially on Italy scenarios where front is reduced from one to three hex lenght and the faint chance to perform an invasion on other different coastal hex. Nice for what if situations, for example, what if allied invade france in two different coasts dividing the weak german forces? Recommended experienced player managing germans, novice allied. Forts are key for german. In general, very good game but not as good as the big father Eastfront. A must try anyway

WestFront details the conflict between the Allies and Germany during WWII between 1943-45. Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series.

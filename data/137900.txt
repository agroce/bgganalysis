Just okay co-op. Played it two player; with 7 it would be nuts. I like the combo possibility of power cards. Picking a permanent power card at the beginning of game that lasts throughout is cool too.

RATING: 7
Nice coop game where the point is to rescue as many of the human crew as possible before the creeps blow up the pods.  Like how you have a power card, but not a huge fan of when the creeps deny us the ability to draw cards right off the bat.

RATING: 6
Interesting and almost brain burny co-op. It has a very strange difficulty curve (we found, through one game). The very beginning felt super easy; the middle of the game felt impossible; the end felt super easy again. Will have to try some more and see if that holds true.

Jupiter Rescue is another one of those co-op we did not enjoy because it never felt like we ever had a chance of winning the game. The enemies just come out too fast to make any head way. On top of that there are the special power cards that bolster your robot's abilities. While they are neat in theory, the game let's you combine some of those card abilities together but does not explain how some of them work in tandem so you are left to figure them out by yourself. There are not a ton of these special abilities so all it would have taken would have been one more page detailing how those abilities combine.

RATING: 8.8
Really fun game, but also difficult. Modular board and basically you play these security robots that have to evacuate the crew of a space station before these alien Creeps either assimilate them or infest the modules. The robots each get really useful powers, we just have to master exactly how to use them while prioritizing the rescue.

PROS:
Very simple game but robot skills and random map tiles adds replay factor.


CONS:
Rulebook was a little light, but some youtube vids helped clear up my confusion about drawing skill cards.  Can get boring so be prepared to spice things up with variant rules or using more/less robots.

Jupiter Rescue is by far my favorite Twilight Creations game. It is very difficult to win, but that's good. It takes the problem that most coop games i've played have and keep the strategy out of the hands of one player. The randomness of what happens keeps one person from having the plan the whole time. Very hard, but very fun.

A quirky little co-op. Kind of abstract and mathy but loads of fun. You can scale the difficulty by introducing the hard sides of map tiles.

A pretty tense little co-op with some interesting things happening. The board is small and congested and when figures block other figures it makes things quite interesting. My favorite part hands down is picking your special ability at the beginning... great mechanic for doing so and tons of options!

I feel like I want something just a little more from this, like it's almost too simple (while still challenging, especially with the difficult side of the tiles) but being so simple makes it very easy to just get playing right away even with someone new.  I love sci-fi, I love co-op games, and I love puzzles though so this is definitely a winner for me.

8 plays (3x1p, 2x2p, 1x3p, 1x4p, 1x5p). 2 player session-- learned/played while drinking in a Vietnamese bar in St. Paul, fun game...  a victory. Used the easy side of the tiles. Next, played it solitaire on the hard side of the tiles. Still too easy, unless I was lucky... Pretty easy to modify the rules a little to increase the difficulty ... such as the rule's stated option of needing to rescue ALL humans. That I have not yet been able to do. Maybe it is harder with more players. Update, played with 4 and a no quarterbacking rule... Good challenge, and more strategies become relevant like endgame guarding communications and power plant tiles.... Lots of fun. Good game.

RATING: 7
This game is never easy, you always feel like you're losing til the last 10 minutes and then everything comes together and you are fine.  I have yet to start using the more advanced tiles.  My main complaint on this one is that I feel like the collaboration tends to devolve into a few people making all the decisions for the more passive players so sometimes it's less fun than others.  It's better when the players have all done it a few times and have a real feel for the play.

RATING: N/A
Played it once with a casual gamer, we lost because we weren't very efficient with our actions. Played it again with a gamer friend, and the game pretty much played itself once we figured out the most efficient steps...and even then, the game was a slog to finish because we were just moving bits around knowing that we were going to win but needing to slowly shift 1 piece around at a time.

Another game with a preliminary rating after only two plays. But since I don't own this one, I don't know when I'll get another chance to play this. Overall, I would put Jupiter Rescue in the take it or leave it category. It's fun to make the best of special abilities cards you get dealt, but all in all the game was a bit to basic for my taste. Don't get me wrong, I do love games with simple rules, but Jupiter Rescue felt a little bit too repetitive and also a bit too abstract. Lately, I've been enjoying Legends of Andor and Robinson Crusoe and Jupiter Rescue just didn't immerse into it's setting like these two do. 

To sum it up: I would play it again if requested, but I wouldn't ask for it and would always prefer to play any one of the co-op games I mentioned above.

Fairly average cooperative game with an extremely boring starting setup. If the creeps manage to eat into the colonists early (due to bad dice rolls) you're toast, if they don't it's a piece of cake. Also, it doesn't look like the advertised "hundreds of station variations" actually have much of an effect on the game.

Jupiter Rescue is a co-operative strategy game in which players work together to escort 28 colonists to an escape pod before they're converted into alien creeps. Each turn, players may take five actions, choosing from common options — moving themselves, moving nearby colonists, or killing alien creeps — and a series of programming cards that grant them special abilities. These cards can be played on the player's turn to activate the ability. Each player also gets to choose one card to be his "core" ability, letting him use it every turn instead of discarding it.

RATING: 6
This seems to be an average "pure co-op" game. On the plus side, it seems to be more challenging based on the first time playing. The bad guys show up after each player turn, and depending on how the players roll they can get under pressure faster or slower.

On the minus side, it overstayed its welcome. With 6 players it was over 3 hours for a relatively straight forward game. About bored halfway thru and lost interest.

And the theme is a bit contrived in an effort to find a theme that is used by other and more popular co-op games. Several of the game mechanisms are a stretch that does not work well with the theme.

Would play again with fewer players to see if it runs better.

Jupiter Rescue is an enjoyable but fairly simple co-op game. It seems ripe for an expansion, but it as-is still provides some fun.

Also, replace those ugly looking humans in the game with more interesting tokens. Most of my friends replaced them with chicken meeples, making the game a bit funnier.

This is a nice take on the typical cooperative game. I really enjoy the theme. The play is pretty straightforward and simple to learn through the rules. I like the idea of combo-ing the abilities together to allow you to do fun things, but I do feel like they don't synergize very easily. Also, some of the combos are not very intuitive.

The components are nice. Love the miniatures; I think they're excellent, but the tile pieces lack a little bit of interest in the artwork/graphic design. The artwork on the cards is pretty fun; I enjoy it.

It's not my favorite game as it can be brutal, but it's fun to play with a good group.

A fun light co-op game.  Easy to teach and doesn't take too long.  It can suffer from "alpha gamer syndrome".  Also, more thematic than most co-ops that are similar.  Picking a trait makes each player unique and the cards are functional.  Nasty cards in the deck give it a Pandemic-like feel.

RATING: 7
I love how your special ability comes from the deck of power cards.  Allows for greater variety between games.

Very simple game flow, but some interesting tactical decisions to be made.  I find coops can have a limited replay-ability, especially the simpler they are.  This looks like it may suffer from that so I will likely only play this in big groups so it doesn't become overplayed too quickly.  It'll handle 7 players, which is a nice bonus.

Perfect if you're looking for some coop variety after Forbidden Island and Flash Point.

Fun co-op game that I have yet to win...yet it doesn't discourage me from coming back for more.  Nice components - lots of plastic minis - and while the human color and poses are a bit awkward, it does serve to make them stand out on tiles that are filled with plastic and busy graphics.

Fact that tile number is oftentimes underneath a plastic mini is a bit annoying when looking for creeper spawn points.

RATING: 7
This game has that "Pandemic/castle panic/defenders of the realm/ghost stories" mechanism where the enemies slowly start to grow throughout the game.  You think things are going well and then find that you are surrounded by the enemy struggling to just stay afloat.

I really enjoy that sense of growing tension, although this one does it on a slightly lighter side.  I like that it requires a lot of teamwork and player conversation about how best to plan a turn, so even when it's not my turn I feel included and engaged.

One disappointment is the lack of cards in the deck.  It's a really thin deck of cards that gives powers or results in negative effects.  So you start to see the same things come up pretty quick.  I've only played it with 2 players so far.  With 4 players each holding 4 cards, most of the deck would be gone!  Here's hoping to an expansion with more cards.

It's a nice implementation, easy to teach and easy to play, but its simplicity unfortunately leads to a sense of repetitiveness. There's only a few actions to do ... move, move a colonist towards safety (that's your win condition), or kill an alien (because if there's too many, they start running out of available spaces and will start converting colonists to aliens, leading to a loss condition if there aren't enough colonists to save). It comes down to playing cards smartly and minimising the number of moves you have to make (which requires some co-ordination, so here's your co-op), as well as rolling well to minimise the number of aliens you put out each turn. Most turns are pretty easy (and repetitive), just doing more of what you did last turn, so the game moves along at a decent clip, but overall it takes too long for the decisions it offers. Cards are theoretically hidden to force co-op talk, but otherwise it's a solo director-driven game. Additionally, once you get started, theme goes out the door and it becomes just an abstract move/remove game. Nice try, decent fun playing, just don't see more games being different enough from the first game to warrant huge replay when added to the other issues.

A pretty basic cooperative game, made interesting by a handful of neat design choices. The permanent super power card each player gets can sway the difficulty of the game quite a bit, but they also help keep every game fresh and exciting. I love the components in this game, even if this would most likely be a $30 title instead of $50 without the fancy minis.

Many different levels of difficulty can be set for this game using both the number of players and which side (hard or easy) for each of the tiles used to create the board.  Couple this with being able to play with up to 7 players or make it a solo mission, this game is very versatile.  The only complaint I've seen on the reviews is that this game says it plays in 30 minutes, but I think you really must know how to play this game to make that time frame.

Jupiter Rescue is a terrific cooperative game that offers plenty of interesting choices and rewards smart tactical play. My only caveat is that this is a very difficult game so it can exacerbate the "quarterbacking" issue that plagues most co-op games wherein one player tries to control all of the decisions that get made. A high level of replayability and quality components are both big pluses. If you like co-op games, Jupiter Rescue comes highly recommended.

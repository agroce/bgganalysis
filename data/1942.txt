Trick Taking, Asymmetric Deck, Shedding game.  Very nice mix of mechanisms for a fun card game.  I like it very much though maybe my enthusiasm will wane when I realize how much card counting is required to play it well.  Played very well for 4P, curious about the 3-6 range.

A decent trick taker with the twist that instead of trying to void suits it is best to have as many suits as possible in your hand for as long as possible.  The cards are good quality and I rather like the line-drawn artwork.

Great light, lightning-fast trick taking game. Strategies are deeper than first appear (but still quite light). Great for a group of 5-6 who aren't in the mood for a brain-taxing game like Mu. Though the game can actually get rather brutal and there's plenty of opportunities to screw people over. And I absolutely adore the art!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The trick (no pun intended) with this trick-taking card game is that there are four colored suits with different numbers of cards in each.  And it's not exactly a trick-taking game, because the object of the game is to run out of cards first--and the person playing the lowest card in each trick has to sit out the next trick.  This one took a little play time to think about, since it's a little different from standard trick-taking games, but it was fun.  The artwork on the cards is quite cute.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Odd trick taking game. 4 suited deck with variable ranks in each suit plus 4 sorta wild cards. Must follow suit if possible, pitching is dangerous. Lowest card on the trick is the fool for the round, with off-suit cards automatically being weaker than on-suit cards for this purpose. The 4 sorta wilds are always on-suit, but always are the lowest card in that colour, so they can only avoid being the fool if someone pitches off-suit. The fool is prevented from playing a card to the next trick, and the goal is to get rid of your hand each round. Once someone is out of cards everyone scores negative points equal to the sum of the ranks they have left in their hand. Play X rounds where X is equal to the number of players.

Foppen is a workable trick taking game, but it seemed to outstay its welcome for me, and it was more than a touch out of control with 6 at the table. Counter to most trick taking games, being short suited is a detriment in this game, though having a Mississippi (long run of one suit) can be powerful in this if you can keep the lead as it will guarantee that you don't end up being the fool. Probably considerably more in control (i.e.: better with 4 or even 3) but so is every trick taking game ever devised. An OK hook with the fool idea, but the rest of the game is mediocre and really would have benefited from some sort of incentive for actually taking tricks, as the scoring means that the game is really just about running out your hand, which is decidedly less interesting and challenging. I'd likely enjoy the game more at the lower scale, but it only seems to come out with 5+ at the table...and honestly, there are many better games at the 3 and 4 scale to choose from.

A Fopping strange trick taking game. I had the fopping fop kicked out of my fopper the first time I played this. It is pretty fopping fun for what it is though.

RATING: 9
If I had to choose my favorite Friedemann Friese game, this just might be my top choice.  The game play is simple, yet decisions on card play are much trickier than it seems.  What looks like a good or bad hand can easily be mismanaged into the opposite.  Its too bad this didn't have a wider release initially.  Foppen is really worthy of a reprint and is a must for trick-taking fans.  Works for four, but really hums with five.

I got creamed at this so I really need to play again to get a better feel. I didn't like the Foppen being ping ponged between me and one other player out of 5 with no escape in sight, but still I could have learned to lose more gracefully.

Lexi loves this game but she loves all Friedemann Friese games.

RATING: 7
Components: Standard cardstock, with easy-to-recognize colors and funny little stick drawings.

Experience: Fun trick-taking / get-rid-of-your-cards game. The scoring is interesting, because it allows a player to score a bonus just for cruising in under the radar, without actually ever winning and leading. Having a fool is an innovative yet somewhat cumbersome mechanism.

Interesting trick-taking game, where the low card sits out the next trick.   You then try to run out your cards as fast as you can, but tricks are worth nothing.   Points tend to go mostly backwards (well, in my case, anyhow).  Kind of impressed how well this worked with 5 and 6 players.

RATING: 7.5
I thought that I had seen every variation of trick taking game that there is before someone whipped out [thing=1942][/thing], a game from the distant land that was 1995.  And this Friedemann Friese is excellent.  

The novelty here is that the person who played the lowest card in a round sits out the next round. If that sounds a bit pointless, it isn’t, as it adds a huge amount of tactical decision-making to trick-taking.  It is a great shame that it is almost impossible to get hold of right now.

FOPPEN ist ein Stichspiel sehr konventioneller Bauart aus dem grünen Bremer Frühwerk von FF. Die Handkarten können einem dabei durchaus in einen schwer steuerbaren Zwang hinein manövrieren, wo das Spiel dann den Spieler spielt, wenn man z.B. früh eine Fehlfarbe zu erkennen geben muss. Wenn man da nicht an den Stick kommt, kann man die Runde gerade vergessen und den natürlich grünen Foppstein entgegen nehmen. Inzwischen 20 Jahre alt ist FOPPEN eine 1000x kopierte Idee mit zwar sympathischem Eigenverlagkolorit, dessen damalige Einzigartigkeit sich für mich heute kaum mehr beurteilen lässt. Der Zahn der Zeit hat auch ordentlich an der Grafik genagt, die schon damals - nun ja - wenig inspiriert war. Das lieblose Strichmännchen ist mit wohlwollendem Blick verfehlte Kunst.

An interesting twist on the trick taking game, though the twist isn't enough to make me actively want to seek out the game and play it repeatedly.

Very few (if any) other choices.

RATING: 7
Fun little card game that is quite simple in gameplay and plays very quickly.  Card draw can screw you over and condemn you to a poor round but there are usually ways to reduce the damage most times if you recognize the danger early!  Basically, the player who plays the lowest card has to sit out the next round.  Your objective is to play out of cards as you seek to have the lowest score.  Probably best with 5 or 6.  

While trick taking is involved, this game is much more about avoiding playing the low card and not so much about trick taking unless it helps you to play out of cards.  Failure to recognize this can lead to frustration with the game.

I like how the scoring Foppen mechanism works (player who plays the lowest card is the Foppen and sits out the next round).  With more plays my rating has improved.  The game has some depth, in knowing when to play what cards (the choices aren't obvious), yet it maintains a light feel.  Must play multiple hands to help mitigate the card deals but an experienced player should be able to manage most hands.  I love the beautifully quirky artwork.

An older card game by Friese where the loser of the last trick misses the next. It's an odd deck (suits of 20, 16, 14 and 10 if I remember right) but playable with a Sticheln deck if you want to try it out. Best with 5, ok with 4. Good hands really help, as will card counting. Things that help are keeping a strong suit to play out the mid-game, knowing who's short in what suits, tracking what's left in each suit, knowing when to play high to stay in, and when to play low to keep yourself strong for later. But a high hand means you don't have to worry about much!

Someone please reprint this one with the original artwork!! THIS is what I've been looking for in a trick-taking game. A lot of meat, and not so stiff. Be the first one to play all your cards without possessing the Foppen at the end to score the best points.

Leave it to Friese to create a wonderful trick-taking game that really isn't about taking tricks so much, and has artwork of a Dr.Seuss-meets-TimBurton-like style.

RATING: 5

Trick-taking Rummy or trick-taking Big Two, since you're trying to rid yourself of your hand and Go Out first. Failing so, you want to be caught with low card values in hand.

Three kinks: the Ones, Fool and uneven card distribution. The Ones and Fool are winners for this game. Not so sure about the card distribution. I understand that it creates some asymmetry between the suits that makes the game different (plentiful and high versus scarce and low), but I'm not entirely sure that it's any better than if the game was just played with a normal poker deck. Need to play more to judge.

RATING: 6.5
[2F-Spiele 95 edition] {Card filler; shedding, betting; optimal 4-6p} {basic and bidding variant 6} Foppen is a strange shedding game, which borrow the follow-led-suit mechanic of typical trick-taking game. (Though it's categorized as trick taking game in BGG, I think it's a shedding game.) It's fun, tactical and fast-paced. I would like to know how the distribution of the cards is designed. Good card counting skill certain helps in this game.

The bidding variant is quite strange event though it has the footprint of Friedemann - making decision with very limited information. It's not easy to guess who will win the hand.

The illustration is bizarre, yet funny. It is different from other card games and it saves the game from being pedestrian.

For some reason we always play this with 6, which is okay, but I think it's better with 5. Cute art. I love that the foppen is assigned the tedious task of clearing the trick.

Nice light weight filler for 6 players.  I rank it up there with The Great Dalmuti.  Of course this is a completely different game.  The goal is to get rid of all your cards but that's where the similarity ends.  This is fundamentally a trick taking game.  If you play the lowest card to a trick you are the fool and don't get to play to the next trick.  Getting rid of your cards is good having big cards when someone else gets rid of their cards is bad.

Great card game.  It particularly works well with bigger groups.  It is easy to teach and great fun.  I wish it was still in print!  The art and the foppen piece are wonderful.  I love the foppen mechanism.  Very clever.

I love the art and game play is fun if not particularly new and exciting.  A good game - it seems to work better with a bigger group of people.

There's a really neat game in Foppen, if you like trick-taking games.  The game is a standard enough trick-taking game, with the twist being that whomever loses a trick is required to sit out of the next trick.  It suffers a bit because that one mechanism requires that the maximum number of people play the game (it's extraordinarily weird with just three players), but the extra players mean you have smaller hands, leading to less control over the game.  In addition, the lack of a trump suit means that one player can take the lead in his strong color and hold it until he runs out of cards in that color.  It seems to be a little broken, but the 1s alleviate some of that weirdness by allowing people to play under the lowest played color.  Regardless, the game probably deserves a bit more attention.

In the majority of trick-taking games it is always good to be short suited.  Not so in Foppen, since off suited cards are always considered to be lower in value.  So once you understand that concept, the rest is pretty much cake.  Being long in a color is good as long as you can get the lead somehow.  Watch out for the evil 1 card though.  I really like the flow of Foppen and what's even greater is it can accommodate up to 6, which not many card games can do.  Too bad it is so hard to find a copy.

After 2+ Plays: Nothing too deep here, but enjoyable for the short time it lasts.  This seems to fall more toward the "at the mercy of the cards dealt" end of the spectrum than the "overcome a bad hand with skillful play" end.  If you like trick-taking games it is worth a try, but it probably won't blow you away.

RATING: N/A
German 2nd Edition, with English pasteup and translated books.

RATING: 10
UPDATE--I really should buy the Z-Man version, since I think I'd play it more. I forget if Matt owns it already, though--if so, I can probably borrow it from him. My version served its purpose well, but there just seems to be a better solution out there now.

German version, but Englishified.  One play so far with Kristen and my brother, and it was a blast!  No nostalgia affecting my rating--the game spins out convincing stories and is probably the most themed game I've ever played.  My brother encountered a blind man whose depressing life story caused him to become grief stricken; I ran into an enchantress whose spurning of my offer of aid made me envious, forcing me to attempt to rob the princess I ran into in Kiev and leading to my imprisonment.  Kristen ended up learning great wisdom from her jailer in Tana before setting off on several adventures that culminated in her freeing a wizard from a trap and being told the location of the Spokhaus.  She then returned triumphantly to Baghdad.  Brilliant, unique game, and well worth the effort of converting from German to English.  

[update] Have played the standard game several times now, and would have to say that 4 players or under is probably the optimal amount.  I'd like to try the other modes soon, especially the quest game.

A game my husband loves as much as I do.  We played this once - a friend of ours owns it - and we fell in love with it so much we had to buy our own copy.  This is the game we take to all our board game parties - we love teaching new people about the joys of this great game.  Yes, it is reading heavy, but the stories!  No two games have ever been the same. And we have played over twenty games now, so we would know!

Great fun, slathered in theme, lots of laughs and groans. A little fiddly, in an 80s sort of way, but it hasn't gotten in the way so far. Has provided more hilarity than just about any game I own.

In some senses an incomplete game, but a wonderful one that opens up endless avenues of possibility. It is probably best to make up one's own stories altogether while consulting the book of tales. While this is suggested in the rules as a variant, it refers to the protagonist making up his own story. My conclusion is that other people should make up the stories for the protagonist instead, after the novelty of the book of tales wears out. This is a great social game.

RATING: 8.5
This game is playable with 2 players but is far far better with 4. A gift for storytelling helps as the game centres around encounter cards and especially the Book of Tales, which is best read with a bit of ad-libbing to give the game a storytelling feel. The only drawback is that players with no imagination can lose interest, for example recently one player (a player of the heavy builder games) sadly decided to talk constantly throughout the game and make snide comments from the start. It gears itself well to the non-gamer as there is very little skill involved, it is mostly on the encounter reactions which may not end out the way you would expect....

IMHO this is best as a 2-player game. I pretty much play the adventure game only and in that context I rate this a tremendous. It can bog down with more players but I would say on average I have played this once every two months for the past 20 years.

RATING: 6
Fun story game.  I see all the elements in there for a modern remake.  Using a couple decks of cards instead of the Book of Tales.  Remove the gender bias.  Expand the skills and treasures.  etc...  The variable point victory condition thing was interesting, destiny and story points and not knowing necessarily whihch you would get.  There were other plusses as well, the special locations added some variety to map encounters.  Resolving events in the game based on skills was also interesting.

2/14/15: This has been reprinted, so is available for much less than I paid for it.  It is fun, but it's about the journey, not the destination.

A fun multiplayer create your own adventure game.  Not something that I'd want to play every week, but fun every now and then.  May be too random for Eurogamers, but fun as long as you're into RPGs.  I would expect that with more than 4 players you'd start seeing quite a bit of down time.

We played this so much that we wore the Book of Tales out and had to photocopy the whole thing!  No real strategy or tactics in this one, but the game is great fun.

We usually play with multiple statuses (which makes the game incredibly complicated) and to win you need to complete three quests as well as achieve your story and destiny point targets.  (The quests give a reason for your otherwise fairly pointless wanderings across the board.)

There were a couple of glitches in the game (one could become lost and imprisoned for much too long) which we fixed by altering the book and creating a new "Imprisonment" table.

What a wonderful and different kind of game.  You've got to have an imagininative group of story tellers to play this to make it really enjoyable. I remember one game, I met a talking donkey in the desert, took him to the nearest city and when he wouldn't talk it drove me mad and I got locked in the dungeon!  This is just how the story progressed!! It could have went any myriad of ways.  You actually live an adventure and create a story for your character/player.   Never seen anything like this before.  There are also tons of different ways to play the game.  This is an absolute jewel of a game IF you have a group that doesn't mind storytelling.  Beware, ebay prices are HUGE and it's hard to find them now days. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't usually like games that rely heavily on theme, but this game really puts you into the adventure.  I would rate this a little higher except for some difficulty with the rules and the feeling that this needs to be played with a group that gets into the story and is less concerned with the best move/strategy/tactic.  *Update* Wow, played a second game and it was terrible.  Every turn we spent five minutes looking at the rulebook, and two or three of the adventures repeated themselves throughout to the point that we could remember what the optimal choice would be.  It was bad.  Needs fixing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A truly original game and lots of fun for people in the mood for a chaotic adventure.  Definately there are some design flaws but they are nothing compared to the mighty success of the game in achieving it's goal.  If arabian adventure (or any adventure) is what you want, this game delivers better than any other I've seen.  Replay value is limited though, otherwise I'd give it a 10. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
More of an "experience" than a game.  I like the storytelling aspect of it, but the random outcomes to every encounter can be frustrating and make no sense.  Some skills seem to be more useful than others.  Worse than that are certain statuses that make the game a very unpleasant waste of time.  Having been Lost for many, many turns when I played makes me want to avoid playing this game again.

We had a lot fun in the &#039;80s playing the Storytelling game. Can&#039;t remember mmuch mroe about it, except it was very theatric and entertaining, kind of like a role playing game that was all right to finish after the session (didn&#039;t go on and on and on week after week). Sort of spontaneous guided role playing in a way.

A choose your own adventure with multiple people at the table.  For me it drags when not being the reader or the player. Random choices without understanding of the consequences or outcomes leads to a feeling of stumbling through a story without a plot.

RATING: 8
One of my most played games for a long time, it presents
a fun random story which unfolds for each character.

Playing this one competitively absolutely ruins the 
experience though - especially once you begin to learn
the paragraph book. In fact, even as a pure story game,
the paragraph book becomes old a little fast. But, it's
great fun to bring to new players - and a lot less annoying
than Talisman.

The box is very old and worn but the game is still in great condition. I got this in a trade and really hoped to play but it's just to much of a beast to learn the rules for when I'm really busy reading and editing rulebooks fo a living! Hopefully I can find this one a good home.

Largely luck-based, very little strategy/tactics (except, perhaps, to try to pick reactions appropriate to your abilities), but amusing.

Too many of the "modern" games that I see hitting the tables these days are little more than heartless mechanical exercises that ultimately have little function other than to provide a reason for 2-6 people to sit around a table to see who can follow the rules most efficiently.  TotAN is the exact opposite of that style of gaming- it's passionate, colorful, enchanting, and one of a kind, full of surprises and outrageous fortune.  The system itself is brilliant, accomodating a huge amount of variability and diverse experiences in a compact, simple set of rules that is easy to learn and much less intrusive than the kitchen sink approach used by most purveyors of fantasy/RPG-style board games these days (FFG, I'm talking to you).  The statuses are tremendously amusing when using the essential multiple status rules.  Yet again I'm reminded of what has been lost in the wake of the popularity of the Euros- creativity, variety, and imagination have been replaced by "clever" or "elegant" mathematical systems without any soul.  TotAN is a genuine classic that should be played by anyone who loves games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is the best storytelling game I have ever played. There are tons of ways to play. Even playing the basic game you can follow a dozen different paths and goals, allstory-based for the most part. Has a reasonable combat system too. Love this game. It's been my favorite for years.

RATING: 7
I have the original, but Z-Man did a great job of building upon the original without losing any of its appeal. This is fun to play with a group of people who get into a little role-playing in their board gaming! :-)

NOTE: My lower rating for the original is because the components aren't as good as in the reprint by Z-Man.

HOW is this game any better than Talisman? It gives you the illusion of control but really is just fiddly and random. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the randomness; I just think it's essentially the same as Talisman, but the latter does it more elegantly.

Compare: DRAWING A CARD

TO: playing a card, rolling dice, consulting a chart, reading it aloud, cross-referencing the result, rolling dice, looking the result up in a book, reading it aloud, resolving the encounter.

The result is the same, "something happens to you", but just takes that much longer in TotAN.

This game is compelling in so many ways, but the one that I think makes it a real home-run for me is the choices.  On any given encounter, you have at least 4 or 5 choices on how to interact.  That's great!  Will you attempt to rob the guy, or will you follow him to see where he goes?  Even still you don't necessarily know what will happen, since you roll a die and randomly affect the result.

I like playing this one for the experience much more than I play it to win.  That's where my fun comes from.

My wife and I only played this once and then went ahead and sold it.  While there is a lot to appreciate about the game, with it's elaborate "choose your own adventure" system, wonderful artwork on the map and overall flavor.  However the game experience was just too lacking.  It felt hopelessly random and you wandered through the game and no tension was felt by either of us as we played.  It was cool to have this story unfold for you, but without any meaty decisions to be made on how to direct the story arc of the character it all just fell flat.  It's an "experiential" game and while I wouldn't mind playing it some more the prices on ebay are just too good to hold onto it for ourselves.

I usually don't think much of "experience" boardgames; most of them seem to combine the worst aspects of RPGs with the worst aspects of boardgames to end up with something less fun than a mediocre game from either category. 

This one has enough options to have some replay value and enough attention to detail from the designer that it doesn't collapse into a morass of conflicting rules. There are a few parts that can be subject to tedious repetition (like becoming imprisoned) and a few whose outcomes seem kinda surreal (how visiting a healer can "cure" your need to go on a pilgrimage); however, it's much cleaner than the more recent "experience" games, even though most recent ones are stripped down in comparison. It could benefit from more incentive to move around the map though.

Probably best with 3-4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light on rules but big on story telling.  This is a rare game where you'll have a lot more fun if you make no attempt to win at all and just enjoy the (carpet) ride.  You'll get dozens of plays before you start to learn some of the encounters in the book of tales, but you'll grow tired of your hunchback jailer quicker than you can say 'punish'.

Pure genius in game design, if you are not looking for heavy strategy or tons of influence. Admittedly, the game seems rather random and takes a while, but it is just plain fun and not boring at all.

I'm quite taken with this, even if the paragraph style of storytelling seems to harken back to the 80s.  The story can get pretty hilarious with the right crowd.. of course, that's what it's a 7 instead of higher.. you HAVE to have that right crowd every time to have a great time with this game.

RATING: 7
A good game brought down by the production.  I know it was from the '80s, so the decision to use lots of little tokens for skills and statuses, but we kept having to look up what status meant what and things just bogged down.  The Z-Man version, with cards instead of tokens, is much easier to play.

RATING: 5.5
Somewhat amusing, but too slow and fiddly paging through the book.  The lack of strategy is tolerable for a while, but after a few hours it starts to feel pointless.  Would benefit a lot from a component redesign to reduce fiddliness.

RATING: 10
A memory maker.

When my group firstplayed this, we all loved it except for one guy--he just didn't like the way it worked. But one of the others said, "I just like hearing the stories." That pretty much sums up how engaging this game is!

German version with English added. I'll probably end up getting the new edition.

Absolutely hilarious. An adventure-storytelling game that doesn't take itself seriously at all. Although more players takes more time, the variety of choices you get with more than 2 or 3 players contributes to a potentially uproarious situation. Fun for anybody with an imagination who wants a bit of the unexpected to pop up in their character's life.

RATING: 8
So random it's hard to really call it a game per se, Tales of the Arabian Nights is a fantastic role-playing experience that embodies the best of 80's gaming.  Takes the character development at the heart of so many other games from this era and centers the game around it.

Unfortunately the script, while as deep as a large book of text can be, does limit replayability.  Three plays in three months, and I think it's time for this game to go back on the shelf for a while.

RATING: 5
It's been a while (like 25 years) since I played this, but it felt more like a roll-your-own adventure than an actual game. You could find yourself locked out of the game if you were given a status that essentially grounded you in a location without a way out, which was less than fun, especially if the others took another 90 minutes to draw it to a close.

Nice idea, but overall, 'no'.

Just arrived from Delayed Reactions in Germany. This is a great game... Not really like anything I have ever tryed before!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Warning: not a competitive game (at all). 

My rating for this requires more explanation than usual, so here goes. 

1.) I've spent some downright enchanting nights playing this game. The sheer variety of experience, epic sense of character building and adventure, and meta-interaction (your turn requires the participation of the player to your left) make for a gaming night unlike any other. 

2.) Make no mistake about it, TotAN requires some tinkering to draw out the great game within, but I don't hold that against it and my 9 rating DOES include some variant house rules which I will post on BGG. Essentially, the only satisfying way to win the game is to become the Sultan, which, if you go by the standard rules, is a surprise victory that often won't happen before the arbitrary SP+DP point targets are met. As such, I only play the "Sultan Game," which adds rewards for reaching 15, 17, 19, and 25 on both the DP and SP tracks. Without these, the game loses a fair bit of momentum if players are determined to 'play for Sultan.' Also, I'll never understand why the city cards are supposed to be shuffled into the draw deck, when they essentially amount to a lost turn. It's a real downer to watch your friends have incredible adventures and then lose your turn to a city card. To address this, I deal out 5 city cards to each player as a starting hand, and then replenish those hands back to five each time through the draw deck. That only leaves a handful of cities in the deck.

3.) I've tried this with the full compliment of six players, and it's nearly impossible for anyone to maintain focus since so many players are between you and your next adventure. It really feels like "the game" just travels around the table, involving you on occasion. I recommend that the game be played with three players, no more, no less. I also think that this game requires that everyone at the table be kindred spirits of a sort. 

4.) The Sultan Game takes 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 hours to finish with three players. It's a joy to play the whole time and really flies by, but because of the length I would not say "I always want to play this game." Additionally, the game is probably best left on the shelf for a couple of months between plays so that players do not become too familiar with the Book of Tales.  So it's a special and unique game, but not one to play over and over. 

5.) Finally, to describe the game itself: in TotAN you move to a location on the board and flip up a card. The card will tell you what sort of being you've encountered (princess, djinn, ne'er-do-well, and many more). A die roll with modifiers will then randomize the type of being you've encountered (anything from doomsaying to merry to crafty. There are probably 100+ possible adjectives in this game). Based on your skills (of which there are 15 or so possibilities) you will then choose a reaction (usually 4-8 choices) such as "rob, honor, grovel," etc. THEN, you roll to somewhat randomize the result, and consult the book of tales. If one of your skills is relevant to the situation, it will usually (not always) improve the success of your encounter. Eventually, you master your skills, which makes them override the outcome randomizer (so if "Quick Thinking" is possibly relevant, you automatically go that route). This is what I like most about the game, because as you build your character, you slowly snowball into more exciting and rewarding situations. Eventually, you'll have done so many interesting things and be so seasoned by experience, that the Sultan result will pop out of the book, giving you the win. 

**My one caveat with this game is that it could better match outcomes to decisions, or narrative to role-playing. However it's tough to feel strongly about this when Tales does it better than every other game on the market. Face it; designers suck at this.

German version. Play for the experience of being cursed, enslaved or losing your mind. It doesn't matter at all if you win or lose. Definitely worth the two hours to play although it can get a bit processional at times and the status handling is either unrealistic if you play just one status at a time or potentially conflicted if played with the multiple status option.

RATING: 6
It's hard to give a comprehensive account of TotAN in the space of a comment. Calling it a flawed masterpiece is perhaps being careless with words, but it is at least a flawed piece of originality and workmanship. The advanced rules in particular - storytelling, merchant, quest, and by extension solo - all have their various problems, and it may be that you're better off sticking to the basic game, making the odd correction or addition to the rules, supplying as much extra colour or imagination as desired and convenient, and then just seeing what stories emerge. The game may be best with three players, who should all be in for a flavour ride and not a competitive game. However, if you can play the third edition there's probably little reason not to do that instead.

Thrifted a German edition copy on 7/2 2011.

RATING: 7
The Good: Beautiful map. Plays solo. A lot of work was put into this one to ensure a lot of variability from play to play. Have to pursue several different tasks (quests, money, character strength) to win.

The Bad: I thought I would absolutely love this one, but it kind of fell flat for me. The encounters were kept generic, so that multiple different encounters could be resolved thru the same paragraph. As a result,the paragraph generically described what happened, and sometimes it did not make sense. This really hurt the adventure to me. Took over 3 hours for first play.
There were lots of things to do, but winning seemed too easy - except for the quests.
Counters are old style - detail on them is blocky. Cards are really thin cardboard - cannot really shuffle them.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 8
I've played with my friend Niklas' copy of Tales -- it was great fun, though we've never actually finished a game. My copy is the German edition 1998 edition (hopefully soon w/english story book).
 
UPDATE: This is really a great game, being designed in 1985 and all. The stories (produced) do are timeless.  
It can also be quite quick playing (as in 2-3 hours) if you're disciplined in passing the rules around and roll the die ahead when reading paragraphs. It all depends on what group you're playing with of course. Also, being roleplaying gamers probably helps ;) Rerated 7 -> 8.    
Have got hold of the translation package (thanks to everyone involved, not least to Eric Goldberg!) Still haven't gotten around to pasting up the cards, but the "2nd edition" english story book is printed, and I'm hoping to get to try it out soon.

This is one of my favorite games and would likely be one of my desert island games.

A perfect conversion of the arabian nights into a game !
The rules seems difficult at the first sight (especially if you use the merchant rules) but only one player need to master it. the game use some of the mechanics of the role playing books of steve jackson and ian livingstone. You move your characters on the board before reading and choosing their adventures in a big book. Strangely, the replayability of the game is excellent because of the many choices you have.
The solo rules are very good too for once.

RATING: 10
So obviously this isn't a game for strategy buffs. There's very little meaningful decision-making, at least of the kind that can substantially effect one's chance at winning. But to anyone who loves the idea of interactive storytelling - whether they've come to it via IF games, RPGs, LARPing, or old CYOA paperbacks - this game will seem like it was handmade in heaven just for them. From the ingenious methods of tracking character development to the cleverly designed movement mechanic, and from the witty entries in the 'Book of Tales' to the curiously austere but always imaginative monochrome card art, everything about it is utterly novel and charming. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the game, though, is how cleverly and lovingly it captures the spirit of the Tales themselves. Playing it really is like hanging out with Scheherazade for an evening.

This title offers a great storytelling experience. Sometimes the worst seeming situations have the best outcomes.

This is the older version.

I love the Arabian Nights theme, I love Choose Your Own Adventure, so I'm probably biased here... but it's just soooo random. Well, I can adjust to randomness, but the game pretends you have choices which is actually not the case - the outcome is usually completely unexpected.

Fun game, marred somewhat by 80's component design.  A touch random, but the stories thus created are interesting enough that you don't care.

A choose your own adventure mechanic applied to a board game.  A high degree of chaos in the movement, and dice rolling part of the mechanics compounded by the fact that the choose your own adventure portion is fairly fickle at times(the obvious good choice is not always the good choice...)  It can also run a little long.

Despite these flaws, the game can be a blast to play for those who enjoy a game for its atmosphere, or as an experience.  Has a few variant versions(including one where the players need to tell stories themselves, and be judged by the other players).  This isn't a game I'll play every gaming session.  I may not even play it for months at a time, but it is definitely a game that has its own unique niche and is worth pulling out when you're in the right mood.

 Vizier, if I may, I`ll tell you my story. Once upon a time in a far away place, I per-chanced to walk into a local gaming store where there lived an artifact of a blue box which lived on the bottom shelf of the Merchants store.
I held it up lovingly in my hands, turning it over and over.I asked the merchant how many talents the blue box was, and he laughed and said.." Only the rich can afford such beauty. Now be gone with you, before I turn you into a pig. " I replaced the blue box and left the merchants store, vowing to myself that I would return one day with enough Gold to buy that beautiful blue box.
Many days passed and my fortunes had changed for the better.Remembering my vow, I took flight once again to the Merchant`s store and running into that place looked about for the precious blue box which I could not see.
" The blue box...where is it?..I have your gold Merchant."
" HA," replied the fat Merchant, " It is sold to the wealthy Hab-Sab, Tutor to her Majesty the Queen. "
I left the store with a sickening sense of loss and a heavy heart. And so Vizier, a great Quest and search was begun..searching many places in many varied lands for the beautiful blue box. Many years passed, 26 to be precise, before happenstance bought forth once more the blue box into my hands by a chance encounter, and now the blue magnificent box rests proudly on my shelf. And the moral of my tale? Never give up hope Grand Vizier, though the road be long and full of wonderful adventure.

I would like to give this 11 but 10 will have to do, and I hope my tale gives someone else the motivation to play this wondrous game.

RATING: N/A
I had high hopes for this game, as it seems to be all about the theme. Starting the game my excitement grew, as the huge matrix of story options looked like it would make a very interesting experience. Things were somewhat interesting for perhaps the first hour, but you slowly begin to realize that nothing you do in the game has any affect at all on the game. Not being able to control your score in the game is forgivable given the type of game this is, but not having any ability to control the story makes everything seem pointless.

You can decide where to move, but this largely has no impact on the story or your score. It only provides a difficulty modifier to a random dice roll for the adventure. The only story decision point you have is choosing from a list of about 8 actions whenever something appears. This seemingly would give you some control, but the results are really completely random. I thought that perhaps you could try and choose an action that would correspond to whatever skills that I currently had, but there doesn't seem to be any connection. For example, I chose pray several times since I had the piety skill. The piety skill was never called for. Once you achieve a master level of a skill, your chances for it applying to the situation are increased, but this still feels random and independent of the action you chose.

Additionally, there are various (mostly bad) states you can be in during the game. I find the states to be a pretty nice addition to the story element, however, they can be extremely overpowering. We had 2 players who were not able to use any of their skills for the entire game due to having (randomly) picked up some status card. This made their game an even more limited and bland experience.

You could achieve the same result as you get from "playing" this game by just sitting down with the story book and the adventure deck, and pulling cards and rolling dice for each person. The player's have no decisions that affect the outcome of the game any more than rolling a dice would. I hesitate to even call this a game, unless you consider something like craps to be a game.

I feel that this product has the potential to be so much more than it is, if only the players could be given a bit more control over the story or anything in the game really. The game might still be entertaining on some level by simply watching the story unfold, however at 2 hours for the 'short game', I think whatever story value is lost long before boredom sets in.

Requires a LOT of time for 4+ players games. You don't have much control over what happens and you have to let yourself be guided by guessing and luck into a rich and strongly themed adventure. Reminded me and felt like one of those books I had in my childhood where you have to pick an action or item to solve situations.

This game has a very rpgish character and it is best played with this in mind. It can be difficult to really influence the development of your character and with some bad luck your chance to win can be reduced quite drasticly. But if you don't play to win at all costs and like some storytelling and have lots of time, this game might be for you. I guess it is best played with 4 players, otherwise downtime can be an issue.

I suppose this is an "experience" game, fun for those who enjoy a near-role-playing game. But I felt like a ball in a pinball machine, with no control over my own fate. At every juncture I had to make an essentially random choice, roll some dice, and suffer the consequences. I made no interesting decisions because I could never predict the results with any confidence.

Still, I'm impressed with the effort put into this game by the designers. The "Book of Tales" contains well over 1,000 paragraphs of results and consequences that evoke the flavor of the stories of Scheherezade, the "Thousand Nights and a Night." If you like this kind of a game, this is the kind of game you will like. I can't rate it any higher than a 6.

Completely original game and the crown jewel of my collection. Nice role-playing feel (like Talisman) but with actual choices. I really appreciate the flexibility of 4 games in one (basic, quest, merchant & storytelling). I have NEVER seen a game published that was anythig like this and the quality in which it was produced. I refuse to play it in a noisy room with other games going on, otherwise the experience is lost. Though it is not strong as a competitive, or strategic game, I feel by its virtues of uniqueness, creativity, and overall "fun factor", it mandates a high score.

Everything Talisman ever dreamed of being. This is an old-school adventure game that ends up telling a fairly entertaining story along the way. It's lucky and doesn't offer meaningful decisions, but if you just want to have a fun adventure I'm not sure any game comes close to this. You can also adjust the length (well the points-to-win) to taste.

Having never been able to play this game due to failure to track down a copy, I then got to play it twice in quick succession at two entirely different events.
And it was fantastic both times.  As long as you remember that this is about the story, not the mechanics, then you'll have a ball.  It's the anecdotes that make this, not the winning.
(Being thrown in prison for eating your dates from a leather bag, then discovering that the hunchback jailer is actually the sultan in disguise... and so on.)
Excellent fun.  I have caveats about the encounter card draw balance, but that's easily fixed by the playing group.

German Erlkonig edition. If you own this edition, PM Patrick Korner to get the English Translation. It helps.

Rating could go up or down after I play the advanced game. 

The game is packed with flavour. It's a more complex 'choose your own adventure' boardgame. However, players are offered alot of opportunites to pick up different skills that will affect encounters.

Wish it had more player interaction. Don't think there's anything on the market quite like it!!

My wife loathes this game. Hates it. She'd give it a 2, I think. "This game has no point."

Let me just say, she likes highly competitive, strategic games. "Experience" games will never warm her heart - I say this as a counterbalance to all the reports of this game being so very popular with the ladies. Not all. Not all, my friend.

On to me: I think it's rather clever and interesting. And although there is a game here, it really is more of a story experience. I'm hoping my oldest will enjoy it when she gets a little older, she spends a lot of time telling stories and playing pretend.

The game itself is pretty straightforward, rules-wise. You travel around, and draw cards, then role dice, generating encounters in the Book of Tales. Sometimes you get to make a decision, but usually, something just happens. I should note that  what happens can often change depending upon what skills you have in the game. When free time is more plentiful, I look forward to spending more time with this one.

RATING: 7
This is a game where lots of random stuff (like 1500 different things) can happen to you. I like it, but seeing Puerto Rico as #1 on this site I don't understand how people here can honestly appreciate it that much. I prophesy that once it's not that "uh-so-rare" anymore bad ratings will start pouring in.

A friend asked if he could borrow it, and I sold it to him instead :p (for a super fair price). I can still play it whenever I want.

RATING: 8
I've only played the quest game.  I really can't imagine why you would want to play the merchant option, but I guess that it is nice that it is there.

Chaos abound, this may be the only game where you can get lost and effectively lose your turn for 45 min and still have a blast.

Not much player interaction in a gaming sense, but it is easy to get enthralled in what other players are doing.

Plus, there is always insanity, in which you can control some of the choices of another player.  (More than enough interaction for this game).  Perhaps it would be nice if there was more to do between players, but at the level of interest that this game evokes, that's like asking for Jimmies on Cookies and Cream Ice Cream.

Tale of one Arabian Knight: So, I'm walking down a road and I encounter a mad wizard. (crazy or upset... either way it can't be good) Then I have the idea that I'm going to rob him because maybe he's got a cool treasure. It seemed like a good idea at the time. So he shot off my leg and I had to hobble all over the world for the best part of my life.

Let‚Äôs borrow 2 geeklist headings to describe this game:    
"Games that reward/inspire creativity", and     
"Pseudo RPG's in which you control and advance a character."   
The rating also reflects 3 things:   
1) I‚Äôm a big fan of "1001 Nights".   
2) I enjoy games that can play solitaire.   
3) No two playings for this game repeat itself, even it is based on a paragraph book to provide the story.   
To conclude, it‚Äôs a great family pastime that predate Euro-games.

A great game -- a 10 with the right group a 2 with the wrong one -- so the 8 is a compromise.  As others have noted it is really best to think of TotAN as a light rpg.  Certainly the best "story"-type game out there.
I've never bothered with the merchant rules.

Wonderfully themed, the paragraphs really do get across the flavor of the Arabian Nights stories.

However, the game itself is almost completely random, with only the most tenuous connections between a character's skills and decisions with the outcomes.

I recently played the latest edition and, despite the slightly better presentation, the game itself really hasn't changed.

It's an experience game, good if you're exactly in the right mood.

Another old favorite. Very goofy and unpredictable, probably more luck than anything else; the atmosphere is what makes it. The Merchant optional game has a bit more heft. It might be a little too hard to exhaust the more unlikely tales within (one West End guy suggested that you should just take the Book of Tales into the john...)

Another K-B toy store find, came out amidst the "choose-your-own-adventure" fantasy craze and lapped the field without much fanfare.  Great solitaire game, and an immersive excursion into the fantasy landscapes of the middle east.

Has several advantages compared to the newer, fancier Z-Man Games version; it's hard to call one better than the other because of how different they are, but ultimately I think higher component durability and a much larger Book of Tales likely gives the new one a small edge.

RATING: 6
Quite possibly the biggest disappointment of 2008 for me thus far.  I love the unique choose your own adventure type of storytelling mechanic.  However, the rest of the game felt really flat to me.  There were way too many fate cards and not enough encounters in the deck.  Since we played what I believe to be the basic game, your turn ended immediately after drawing a city or special card, and as a result many rounds went by with nothing happening.

There was also the occasional problem of repeated paragraphs popping up.  As if there were not sufficient number of varied encounters available.  The magical items and their usage seemed very lacking.  Some of the statuses such as "respected" and "robe of honor" felt rather pointless and do not have much interesting effects for the characters (not to mention we played with the ruleset in which you could not accumulate more than one status, which was rather lame as well as tame).  The idea of wealth was completely superfluous with very minimal impact.

I am still looking forward to the new edition and I sure do hope for some revamped improvements to an outdated system.

Great game - only played it solo so far, will try to bring this on the table on the next occasion. It's has a lot of those old adventure books where you chose a certain action and then read the corresponding paragraph. The advance rules add some depth to the game and only make it even better.

Played with the 1 and 2 expansion. Too much spells and not enough monsters. Everyone had at least 25 mana almost every turn, so the monsters that we encounterd were very easy.

RATING: 7
After repeated plays, this turns out to be a much better game than I expected. New players always seem to comment that it is over sooner than they expected. Most of the more experienced players seem to value its blend of shorter time frame with strategic thinking. Although there is some luck from the artifact cards, the victories seem to go to the players who best plan their position for the final rounds and manage to outbid the others for those last dragons. (Plays well, but quite differently with 2, 3, or 4 players - I prefer 4, but 2 is still satisfying.)

It's a wizard fight with leveling and nice graphics.  Thematically it works very well.  Even with bidding, the game isn't as deep as some other offerings from Adlung, but even so this is a great filler game, and better than some of the other offerings from Adlung.  Playing this game is like eating popcorn.

Awful art and poor rules for a soulless filler slowly grown into a full game over its expansions: if you like a slightly fantasy-inspired card game about competing but cooperating magic-users, you could enjoy Magic Sword & Dragon Egg; if you feel dubious about it though, just avoid it: this surely ain’t a game for you.

Auction and negotiation game with a fantasy theme. Choosing your action and deciding when to cooperate and when to fight alone are the meat of the game. I felt the object cards dealt made a great impact: it seemed very hard to catch up once you were behind in artifacts. The expansions improve the game, but they also make it longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game was fine and all, but it just wasn't my thing.  It's kind of an engine building game where you build up an aptitude for scoring points for defeating certain monsters, but the theme and base mechanisms just didn't catch me.  It also felt more fillerish, but with the length of a non-filler.

It has the capacity to be a great game, but something gets lost in the translation (or else it doesn't seem to be translated well enough for me to get lost in the game).

One game, and I enjoyed it.  It played pretty quickly, about 50 minutes for three players, and should be faster as we gain experience.  Light-middleweight, with decisions about whether to cooperate or compete; whether to pursue spells or combat monsters; and when and how to spend your magic points.  And the game fits in your shirt pocket!

Sort of like a German version of munchkin. You need to ally early to gain an advantage and then later you want to crush those who helped you. 

Plays a lot quicker than munchkin, however a bit disappointed that you play through the whole deck in each game. 

Looking forward to playing with the expansions but not really in a rush to.

Sold in a board game bundle in 2017.

Finally got this one to the table again!

Still one of the best "Adlung Games" and a good game overall, which everyone I played with agreed on. However, I wouldn't bother to play with less than 4. All my games have been 4 players ones, but I'm sure it won't  work as well with less.

It's pretty much a semi-cooperative game from 2003 and this one doesn't have the "alpha male" problem.

I have to try out both expansions, that may put this even higher.

Would've preferred if the ending was "less predictable" (# of cards remaining in deck is easily discernable).  Something like roll a die with the final six cards much like I'm The Boss.  Otherwise, it's a quick RPG card game that quenches my fantasy theme thirst.  If you like a fantasy-themed card game with a little resemblence to RPG, then this might be great for you.

Very good with two players, but our trial run with four did not work as well as I had expected. Somehow there never was a serious shortage of mana, which meant that already strong players were not dependent on the help of the weaker ones. It will certainly get another chance, though.

The vote is back to 7 after one week at 6! I think it is best, when it is played as 2-player game! It still is rather dry, but the game is fairly quick! It is even less fiddly for the scorekeeping when played with 2!Watch out for the second expansion, as then the game gets bigger, longer and better. ;)I still play this game! But ONLY WITH its expansion "Helden & Zaubersprüche"! When played with it's expansion it is wonderfull even with 5 people! Buy it and play it! With this expansion the vote for this game is quite easily: 8

a weird auction game.  I'm not quite sure what to make of it yet.

Another Adlung game that tries to pack the punch of a boardgame in a small pack of cards. This time, players are mages. They generate mana in order to complete quests. The rewards are artifacts (which give bonuses) and Dragon Eggs (the player with the most of these wins the game). There's a few take that effects as well as reverse bidding thrown in for good measure.

Good for a few plays. It's light and fun and doesn't have much depth to it. The artwork is terrible.

Zauberschwert & Drachenei (Espada Mágica y Huevo de Dragón) es un pequeño juego de cartas de Adlung Spiele.

En Ulahomar se respira magia mientras los magos se preparan para probar sus habilidades contra las criaturas mágicas. Necesitarán hechizos mágicos, lugares sagrados y artefactos poderosos para su batalla. Cuando un mago derrota a las criaturas, consigue piedras de poder; al final de todo, éstas determinarán cuál ha sido el participante con más éxito: el Gran Mago de Ulahomar.

Mi intención, después de haber traducido el juego básico, es continuar con la traducción de las tres expansiones: Helden & Zaubersprüche (Héroes y Hechizos Mágicos), Poison Expansion (Veneno) y Wissen & Artefakte (Sabiduría y Artefactos). Y, algún día, jugarlo...

From what I could tell, this expansion is practically a requirement for the game.  I'm not sure about that fifth player, though.  It adds some real competition to the game and makes the turn order much more important, but I thought it added too much chaos.  The fifth player is almost always going to have to compete with someone else to get anything (turn order rotates).  There isn't any blind selection, but it reminded me too much of Pirate's Cove none-the-less.  I was frequently on the short end of the stick when selections and deals were made, so I'm not sure I can trust my judgment on the fifth player.

Z&D is well worth your time to buy and to play.  I was put off at first by the German text and by the variety and seeming randomness of the cards.  I've played Z&D a couple of times now, and my experience has been better each time.  The cards are not as haphazard as I first thought, and the symbols on the cards make gameplay easy, even if you don't read German.  Each time I've played, whether I've won or lost, I've felt satisfied by the game.  It's neither too long nor too short.  There's no downtime since everything anyone does affects you.  There's possibly too much luck in the draw of the artifact cards, but it's not gamebreaking, plus you can trade.  Z&D has an auction element, but somehow it really doesn't feel like an auction game.  The theme is appealing and well implemented.  I'd love to see expansions in the future, or blank cards to make your own.

There's not really anything wrong with this game, other than it being a little fiddly, but there's just not a lot here that's all that intriguing.  There's a narrative that builds up over the game, there's a tension from deciding which location you want to visit, and even some bluffing in the way that you draw folks in to one course of action, freeing you up for something else.  It's weird, and doesn't feel like it's the sum of its parts.  It just feels disjointed, and ultimately unsatisfying.

Another Adlung game that I liked well enough, though it seems to have its problems (at least, with 2 players).  There seems to be a runaway leader problem; once one player starts to get on a roll, it's hard to stop them with their bonus magic points, etc.  I'll play it with more than two and update the review accordingly.

Not a bad little set collecting game.  The claiming stones raise it a notch above the mundane.  The multiple ways to score and the constantly developing situation require some interesting judgments.  This still hits the table occasionally.

Web of Power without the board.  The game WITH the board is much better in my opinion.  This card game is interesting,  but it&#039;s too easy to fall into analysis paralysis.  Lots of scoring options.

Played this yesterday with 3 players. Enjoyed it immensely!
Might be a bit slow between turns in a 5 player game but recommended for 3.

A deck of 56 cards is dealt out face up into 4 rows of 14 cards. Players on their turn can take cards from one country only, and only from the ends of any of the rows. When all cards have been taken score for majorities of cards in a similar fashion to Web of Power. Bonus points and special action tiles can be earned along the way. Fun filler, let down by a lack of choices when your turn comes around.

Interesting set-collecting game of lookahead, timing and momentum.  It is perhaps a little underdeveloped; the core system works well but some of the trimmings are not quite right.  I would like to try the simplified two-player version Richelieu to see whether it improves on the weak points of the design.  *Update* Richelieu does improve on K&K Kartenspiel by smoothing out some of the stranger aspects of the play and scoring.  It's for two players only, but that no big deal since the game was already vastly better for two than for more.

Nice application of the mechanics from Web of Power.  Not really a card game, actually a random setup tile game.  Tense play, funky scoring.  Your choice of teeny cards or huge setup space.

This is a very good game. It is very strategic and scales well between 3 and 5 players. There is no hidden information (as far as the cards go) and although there are several items to consider when choosing a card, a good decision can be made without holding up the game. This is the best free game I have played.

Aug08: This is a nice print and play game from Schacht. It actually was a pretty engaging game and I recommend you give it a try for the cost of some colored ink.

It actually captures the mechanics pretty well in card form. It loses almost all of the theme. It's easy to teach and it has meaningful decisions.

It's not dripping with fun however. It's almost perfect information and feels pretty dry most of the time. Still, it's not a bad game.

I do like it better than Richelieu as like most 2 player games it can also turn into tic-tac-toe.  With 3+ players (I've only played it with 3 thus far) and the Web of Power/China scoring mechanic, this plays much nicer.

Now to find the time to print and play my own copy! ... completed Jan. 6, 2010

Surprisingly fun and strategic.  Easy to play, but difficult to keep track of all the ways to get points.  End game scoring is a little difficult, but not too bad.  I wish the colors were a little easier to tell apart.

Friend brought this game back from Essen: Web of Power with cards. Cards are laid out in a matrix format on a table representing 6 countries. Collect cards starting from the sides. Points are awarded for majorities and each card also has symbols on them, and collecting more of them generate more points (like a road net in the original game). Players also have stones to "reserve" cards; opponents must discard a stone to remove yours. Some face down special actions can be collected (but some are worth -2 points) as well. Not a bad little game, with multiple players, sometimes an opponent is left with good choices. Released as a 2 player game called Richelieu. May play more strategically as a 2 player game, okay game, but as game winds down, one is left with less choices.

This is decent. The rules are crisp, there’s plenty of analysis look-ahead to keep you interested throughout, a smidgeon of luck to break it up a bit, the ability to make selected cards expensive and so influence other players ... and it wraps up in 30 minutes.

The one downside is the potential for analysis paralysis. All the cards are on display. You can work out quite quickly which of the 8 available cards (these are the cards ending each of the 4 rows) are best for yourself. But to play well you need to study and understand what that will leave the next player. And if you can work out what they’ll take, then you could do the same for the next player, and so on. So if you perhaps take a slightly lesser selection now, does that dramatically reduce the number of good options for the next player? And so on. The triple barrel scoring system (number of cards in each region, most symbols in each region (0-2 on each card), roads and boats (0-1 on each card) across all regions) provides the fuel, and the pain, for analysis.

With 3 players, I don’t know if that accentuates the analysis (because you can hope to calculate out the next 2 plays to determine what’s left when it gets back to you) where with 5 you wouldn’t bother so much as it will be a lottery when it comes back to you.

Home-made version of K & K. While it supports 3-5 players, 5 might be a tad too chaotic. This is a card game version of China. No board, but there are still multiple ways of scoring. There are nine different countries of Europe represented on the cards, each with different round symbols on them. Players are trying to collect the most cards in as many countries as possible to score. On his turn, a player can take cards of one color with no more than 2 round symbols on them. The cards may only be taken from the ends of the 4 rows. A player also can reserve future cards with claiming stones. At the end of the game, the player with the most of a country will score an amount equal to the number of cards of that country. The player with the second most cards of a country will score an amount equal to the number of cards the first place player has. Similarly with the player in third, his score is based on the 2nd position player. Also, the player with the most of one round symbol type in a country scores points equal to the number of round symbols. Finally, if a player has at least 5 cards with ships on them will score points equal to that number of cards. Same with cards with carriages on them. This game provides lots of thought-provoking decision-making opportunities in a very short time. Simple rules, complicated scoring almost always make for a good game and this is no exception.

The scoring nature and names of regions from Web of Power are pretty much the only carry-overs from that game, but I suppose that's a good thing.  The mechanics are interesting, and pleasing, but the game is a bit dry, and deterministic.  It's a decent game, but nothing overly special.

Europe, the center of power in the 12th century. Influential Orders struggle for supremacy. By collecting Land cards, you can establish cloisters, bring advisors to council meetings, and improve your network of roads. According to which cards you choose, you can earn different amounts of victory points. At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins

After 1 Play: I was surprised to like this game, seeing as I didn't like either version of the boardgame it's named after (Web of Power or China).  I am always a sucker for cards that have multiple aspects that have to be weighed, so that perhaps explains my preference for this version.  I am looking forward to playing this one again, and I could see the rating going up with further plays.

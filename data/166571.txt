Feels a lot like a modern take on Age of Steam, although I have very little experience with that game. Modular maps, multi-use cards, a deckbuilding / hand management element and quite a few ways to proceed. It looks a little more abstract (or maybe 'clean') yet more attractive. 

The rules are somewhat fiddly but it's a fairly lean game at its core, so you should be able to take the rules explanation slow and steady without anyone nodding off before you've finished.

And the payoff seems to be well worth it - crunchy decisions, lots of player interaction, you always have interesting options yet simultaneously quite a few constraints to work within. Could be brutal at higher player counts, particularly the auction. I predict this will become a favourite.

Here's the thing - at its core this is a great game.  I can see it, tucked behind the mound of poor UI choices, the pile of ambiguous rules and examples (the rulebook is NOT your friend), and the underlying sense that the game is *almost* complete.

There are a number of game elements that just don't *feel* quite right.  The game feels a bit more complex than it should be and some of the rules really lend themselves to this - they make the game more obtuse and more complex without any concomitant improvement in quality or gameplay.  If some of the niggly bits were smoothed out, this thing would be a sleek sports car of a game.  As it stands, it looks far better than it plays.

But I rate it an 8 because I can see that bright, shiny core of awesomeness.  It's there, hiding but present.  If only the cards were clearer with their iconography and design.  If only the auction mechanic were quicker and less dense.  If only the minutiae were more intuitive and less seemingly-random.  If only the penalties weren't quite so punishing (considering it is often the player in the back of the pack who gets smacked).  But it's there - that golden heart of an excellent game.  It's in there somewhere.

RATING: 7.5
good. obviously a descendant of age of steam, but less restrictive in many ways (though not in all). The funky auction is kind of a nice twist, and can be very expensive, but the main limiting factor lies in the multi-use cards, so you can generally do most of what you want to do, making this game feel a bit less rewarding than AoS imo. If you dig the ideas in AoS but hate feeling like you never get anywhere, check this out. Personally, I think the passenger delivery system here is better than AoS, it isn't as random, and the fact that you get different rewards based on where they get delivered to is fun and interesting...but i'd still probably rather play the older game. It's close though, especially since this plays WAY faster. This game is so much better than Alban's first game (Clinic) that it isn't even funny. This one is still fairly fiddly, the overall thrust is clear but there are still lots of little rules to forget (+stress for winning the auction, track can overlap like this and like this but not like that, you need this plus this plus this for this action but only this and this for that action, etc).

It isn’t surprising given Alban Viard’s background that the processes of building tram networks and transporting passengers in Tramways bear a clear resemblance to Age of Steam (AoS).  At first glance, Tramways’ use of track pieces rather than tiles suggests fewer possibilities to block opponents’ routes, but restrictions on placement mean that really isn’t so.  Both games also have an auction that determines turn order, which can be really significant.  AoS piles on the pressure by leaving those outbid with a choice of sub-optimal roles; in Tramways you may be adding a sub-optimal card to your deck.  

That’s where the similarities really end.  Driving the action in Tramways is a deck of cards which you build over the course of the game.  Each card has up to four possible actions and nearly all can also be used as a ticket that’s required when moving passengers.  Even a starting hand offers multiple possibilities for building track, developing locations, transporting passengers, replenishing your workforce and earning a bit of money.  So long as your opponents aren’t prone to analysis paralysis, this all works very nicely.  I am not a fan of deckbuilding, but find it more tolerable when it’s an element of a larger game rather than the entire game.  

Tramways dispenses with a board, providing modular tiles.  While these offer huge variability, my one concern about the game is that some combinations could make for an unbalanced game.  I must stress that I have not yet found this to be an issue.

Viard doesn’t share Wallace’s fascination with debt, and income is not the be all and end all that it is in AoS.  Money is still important to fund the deckbuilding and to convert into happiness (vps).  Both happiness and stress (a black hole of vps) are accrued in several ways during the game.  Overall, everything knits together really well and the result is an engrossing game that I look forward to exploring some more.

Production quality is good.  The artwork won’t bowl you over, but it is functional.  The rules are well written with copious examples, though I would have appreciated a simple illustration identifying the different card types when setting up for the first time.

I haven't played this against other players yet, but this is a really good solo game. Nearly all the information you need is visible at the start of the game, you just need to work out how to get where you want to go (max Happiness Points.)

Hugely variable modular maps and set-up ensure this is going to stay fresh for a long time.

The table top footprint is quite small and the solo game isn't too long.

In Tramways, players will draft cards to add to their hand (deck building). And players will use those cards in different phases (hand management) to build buildings, build links, and transport passengers across those links (Age of Steam). When a player transports passengers across a link, the link's owner gets victory points and money. Furthermore, the player doing the action receives some sort destination bonus. All in all, it is a blend between deck building and Age of Steam, which honestly sounds gimmicky. 

But in practice, Tramways is a meaty euro that I simply can't get enough of. First and foremost, the varied set-up and initial drafting is reminiscent of something like Food Chain Magnate; fairly subtle changes in the initial map and what cards players draft can have a profound effect on the development of the game. It's one of those games where you continuously discover nuances with each play. Furthermore, it's the type of game that give players control but no where to the point where they can ignore other players; much of that is attributed to parcels, which players have a monopoly on until they build a building on them (and once they do, the passengers on that building can be "stolen"). But perhaps most importantly, all the mechanics combine to create something greater than its individual parts. To say this game is tremendously well designed isn't hyperbole. 

For those aware of Alvan Viard previous games, the fact that he made a meaty euro with an abstract flair won't be surprising. But how polished/refined this game is, both mechanically and in component quality, will be surprising. Simply put, this game doesn't have rough edges like his previous designs... yet it maintains the meaty decisions that you would expect. Furthermore, there is quite a bit of originality, especially with the unique Auction mechanic, which is highly contingent on other players and often translates into players spending more for less.

Now as someone who dislikes random factors in games, the deck building element was a bit concerning. After all, its not the type of mechanic you would expect in a heavy euro. That being said, the deck building element is rather minimal, which reduces variance. Furthermore, players pick their cards for the last round, which eliminates luck dictating the end-game decisions. That being said, the game is often frustrating as subtle nuance have a butterfly effect. But that frustration is not caused by luck but rather the fact you overlooked/underestimated/miscalculated something. This is the type of game that rewards thoughtful play and punishes poor play.

Overall, Tramways is splendid.

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed this game! It is a blend of Age of Steam and multi-use card deckbuilding that works very well. I really love the variability that the map set up (made of a varying number of tiles) and tile difficulty adds to the game. At the start of each round is an auction, where players are bidding on turn order and also which new card to add to their hand. There are definitely good cards and bad cards and this adds a lot to the tension of the auction. The auction also uses an unusual mechanic that is quite unique but leads to several interesting decisions about what to bid. After the auction, players will take turns on the board, first taking 1 action and then taking 2. This is also a very interesting design element, because it forces you to make decisions about what to do first and what to save for later. To take these actions, players are playing multi-use cards and this is the real meat of the game. Deciding how to manage the limited actions you have, whether to “stress” yourself to use a card for multiple abilities, and deciding what cards to save for the end of the round are all great decisions. I appreciated the design touch that building track costs an “extra” worker that are a limited resource. This puts the brakes on excessive track building early in the game and helps to time things very well so that there are still options on the map by the end of the game. In the last phase players will discard cards for bonuses (money, rail workers, placing new citizens on the board, reduce stress). There are some interesting cards in the game that force you to pay a penalty whenever you use or discard them. This is also a really nice design idea. Overall the game felt tight, the decisions seemed very meaningful, and there were many things to think about on every turn. It felt different from Age of Steam, but you can clearly see the lineage. I think this game is something special and it is one I am very glad to own.

A decent take on an Age of Steam-like game, with much less focus on the financials, and more focus on the logistics of getting track built, and folks delivered to their destinations.

However, it just felt kind of clunky, and not very streamlined. I'm not a fan of rules that aren't very logical and easy to follow, and this game seemed to have a fair bit of that going on. Rules that were there, and you just had to remember how they worked rather than it feeling logical that they work that way.

It does have some neat stuff going on though, like a clever twist on turn order bidding, and a bit of deck-building with multi-use cards. I just felt like the game around these neat ideas could have used a little more development to streamline things and work out some odd kinks.

This is an interesting brain-burny game of hand management grafted onto Age of Steam style track building and delivery. 

I like the auctions. It can be difficult to move up from the back - be prepared to spend a lot, but that was OK. I managed it. I also typically don't like hand management but thought it was good here. The most interesting decisions in the game for me revolved around how and when to take certain cards, and which cards to take. 

I found a lot of the rules unintuitive. The stress didn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. Why does winning an auction produce stress? It just seems 'gamey' it a way that doesn't help smooth out gameplay. Obviously, they need the rule since money is so loose that player 1 would just bid 10 every time, but seems like a hack. Also, what you can and can't do in each phase can be confusing and arbitrary, and when you need to use the parcel # vs the building type is confusing as well at first. 

I don't love that money is a sort of meaningless part of the game, aside from the auction. There is always plenty. Also, there wasn't a ton of competition on the board, but that could just have been a function of setup. But initially it didn't feel tight, fighting like hell for certain connections like AOS or even Ticket to Ride. I would play again, and could revise rating then.

Alban's best game so far, and by far the least clunky of the trilogy. 

The closest feeling game to Tramways is Age of Steam, so this should hint at how good the game is. You always feel limited (playing the B sides of course): the square spaces have only 4 exits, the boards are slim and rectangular, and mountain and lakes and unowned/enemy parcels make connections difficult or costly, there are few passengers and even fewer refills, there is stress involved, and on and on... The game is thus super tight, super unforgiving, and somewhat opaque. It requires hand management and valuation skills as well as experience with visualising connections to play well. And then you have this weird unique dollar-like auction that actually works. It is more like a premium declaration mechanism than an auction. And then there are other other lovely design gems like when constructing a building, connections to it open up, or the 1-2 action cadence. And the modular board that makes each game unique. Yeah, this is one of the top games of 2016 and one that I will gladly see many expansions for. Alban is, after all, also an AoS map designer. Faultless.

+ Age of Steam-like tightness and heaviness all over
+ innovative, very cool, unforgiving auction mechanism
+ simple rules, can be easily taught if you know the game well
+ tremendous replayability based on modular board and card decks
+ works quite well with all player counts
+ reasonably good beat-your-score solo system
+ solid, apparently clear rulebook with many examples
+ neat handicap system with the player boards
+ solid, even great components (except from the rubbish money dingdongs)

= nasty, confrontational and unforgiving
= can be quite long with more than 3 players
= a little bit of luck involved when drawing your hand that can mess up your timing

- the bloody money dingdongs
- player aids are sorely missing (not cryptic cards, real player aids)

RATING: 9
A messy train game driven by hand management and stress, Tramways is not for the faint hearted.  Many aspects of it are quite punishing, from the void cards, to the negative points accumulated from stress, to the money-sink of a turn-order auction.  You have to be willing to grapple with other players in the mud and accept that you won't get everything you want in the end.  These rough edges make decisions feel more impactful, and make those moments when everything comes together feel more satisfying.  Player interaction on the board is incredible, as everything a player does has a direct impact on the options available to everyone else.  There are often many unintended side effects of actions that seemed straightforward at first.

All actions are constructed from a hand of cards drawn each round from a personal deck.  With so many things desired within a given round, your deck is constantly juggling more actions than it feels like it was built for.  In some ways this can feel luck-based, however the cards are flexible, especially through utilizationing of the stress system.  Luck is also partly mitigated by actions that let you add specific cards to your current hand.  No matter how unlucky, you can always find some positive things to get done by the end of a round, although they may not be what you had originally wanted to do.  

The round structure whereby players perform one action each followed by 2 actions each sounds quirky at first, but in practice it feels perfectly balanced between giving everyone a chance to snag critical moves and allowing players to perform uninterrupted combos.  Yet another quirky aspect is the last round.  Most of Tramways can feel like a wild ride, as you struggle for control over the cards you drew, but the ability to craft your hand for the last round means you can finally get the satisfaction of doing exactly what you want to (barring player intervention).

Tramways is highly replayable.  Each board setup provides a unique landscape of challenges to explore, and the randomized card decks provide a unique set of tools to explore that landscape with.  Furthermore, every player count is enjoyable, even the solo play.  The component quality is very good.  Though the artwork on the cards is almost entirely functional, the iconography is well done.

RATING: 10
Near perfection. A truly gem.

Inovative and brutal auction, agonizing hand management and highly interactive rail building, construction of buildings and stealing opportunities on the passengers delivery. And the maps you can create in the setup brings the replayability to an infinite level.
Amazing distribuition of points, privileges and income in the delivery process. The upgrade system for the rails and buildings is a great addition to the already great options you'll have through the rounds.
Played solo, with 3 and 4 players, and have always a blast of gameplay.
The only drawback are the gold coins, a little difficult to distinguish them to the bronze ones (accentuated by poor lighting).

Maybe I'm wrong, but this can became an classic even bigger than Steam / Age of Steam games. And you don't even need expansions to enjoy it for years to come.

A 10 in my book. One of the best games ever created.

Bought Oct 2017
After 1 play: I really enjoyed the options the game gives you with the balance of the games limitations that come from the deck building element. I felt every turn I was being tempted to take on more stress for big plays or to keep more cards in my hand for upkeep benefits. This balance of things to do and things that will hurt you seemed nicely balanced.

The auction takes a few turns to get used to, and even then a haphazard bid can ruin your turn order or bank account. Love it!

My big complaint is teaching the game. Because of all the icons, rules and exceptions add about 30 minutes a Game with new players. I found myself forgetting little, yet important rules fairly easily throughout the game...and questioning my game setup.

Very much looking forward to playing it again and excited that the next map will be completely different. Has potential to be one of my favorites.

After 5 plays: Upgrading my rating to a 9 now due to the solo game. I still really want to play this with more players more than any other game in our collection. But the solo game is becoming my go to solo game. I've experimented with a few different strategies and tested some limitations of the game and I keep coming back to the vast majority of reasons for low scores is poor play not luck. Depending on how the map develops, your strategy should dictate how you build your deck which in turns either helps or hurts your game. It's becoming a top game for me.

After 10 plays: PENDING

2018-01-26 : First play. This is a game where you bid for turn order, then build tracks, upgrade towns and transport passengers for money and victory points. Sounds simple right ? And it is simple - the rules are pretty straightforward, medium complexity at most - but that's like saying the alphabet only has 26 characters so it's easy to write a hit novel. It's one of those games where the rules fade into the background as you think and re-think your strategy and try to adjust your tactical play on the fly. Is it perfect ? Far from it, but I had to think real hard to come up with a couple of negatives - like the fact you can't thin your deck  and that it keeps growing no matter what you do. The layout and graphics are brutally simple, but they should be, this is not a game about pretty pictures. In a game like this you want simple graphics, so you can get on with the thinky stuff without having to hunt for and squint at tiny icons on cards.

Interesting card management game with a board. Uses some mechanics of (Age of) Steam regarding tile building and passenger moving.

This didn't look like much of a game when setup and I was only mildly interested, probably because I am used to Age of Steam  and similar train games which look so much more impressive.  But this turns out to be a very strong game in its own right.  (As the game progresses the board becomes very colorful.)

Because of my experience with other build & deliver games the rules were quickly grasped .  It has cut throat elements that turn the game into a fun race.  This is the first train game I have played with deck building, a mechanic I enjoy.  The deck building is light and balanced by other traditional train game actions.

RATING: 7
TL;DR: A great game with lots of potential, significantly marred by fiddliness.

There are a lot of nuances to this game; the multiple uses of a single card being the key element to understand, with the rules surrounding parcels a close second, and the mildly confusing auction system a close third.

The trouble with such nuances is that they induce AP; every time I play this it seems to take a lot longer than it ought to. This is fine when you are enjoying it; however, if you take no pleasure in waiting a long time for your turn, this game is not for you.

I personally don't mind that; however, others in the group have complained about that, and as a result this game is not going to get as much play as I would desire.

Added to this is the fiddliness of the track pieces; granted, there are not a lot of ways to avoid this design wise, but it doesn't help.

RATING: 5
Tramways is clearly and openly inspired by Age of Steam. That's what made me perk up. It does add quite a few bells and whistles to the system, however, including building industries, upgrading track for making more money, and a deck-building element. All of these taken together, the game becomes rather clunky, and several of the new or modified parts don't add much to the game besides more clunkiness, e.g. the auction is pretty gimmicky but rather unpredictable and exceptionally harsh to players who are already behind, and the deck-building doesn't really come together in only 6 rounds.

Summing up, I don't see why I should ever prefer playing this over Age of Steam which is simply much more to the point. I am almost inclined to say that Tramways feels like a prototype version of AoS before a developer excised all the unnecessary parts.

I've mainly played this solitaire but have had one two and one three player game.

At the start of each round you really need to sit down and think about how you're going to use your cards so you can get done what you want to get done as effectively as possible (while taking on as little stress as possible). With other players there's even more to think about as there's the possibility that they will block what you want to do or move a passenger before you.

It's not just a tactical puzzle though, you must also give thought to what you are trying to achieve over the course of the game. I like that but this certainly isn't for the casual gamer who doesn't want to think too deeply about their games.

I bought the game because (a) it plays solo, (b) it's supposed to be like Age of Steam, and (c) there is some deckbuilding involved.  All of it is true so far after one play.  It definitely has an Age of Steam feel to it, albeit at a slightly less unforgiving/challenging level.  It's certainly fun, though, and well designed.

Mechanics: bidding (lovely implemented), Deck Building (not so many cards) and pick up and deliver
Decisions: lots, from how much to bid for cards or turn order to where to put your buildings or what passengers to move
Opinion: amazing game with lot of tension. Could have lot of interaction or you can play by yourself, in the bidding you have lot of interaction, but on the actions phase depends on your group (it is easy to have lot of interaction).
I have found a gem for my collection, the game could appear quite tough at the beginning, but it clicks really soon. Another point is to master the game, you will need several plays to do that.
During the game you have lot of things to take into account. Starting with the auction, should I bid more or just a small amount just to stay there, should I go for that card and be the first one with more stress or not. Then you have to choose wisely your actions, there are not so many building to build, and you have to decide if you want to go for that. Then, where to build your links, only usable for you, or in the middle of the rest of the players. And finally, what passengers you would like to move and the advantages and disadvantages they have. All of this suffering the stress that you could ruin your game in the end if you go for that.
And a final point to remark is the use of the cards, the have multiple uses, and many often you will need one card you also need for another action, Combine with the deck building makes this game awesome

Only 1 play under my belt and eager for more.  This is a lovely 'system' that can be expanded with maps just like Age of Steam, the obvious 'prelude' to this modern version of trackbuilding/pickup-carry. Really enjoyed the card drafting and multi-use action mechanics.  There's a wonderful train game here.

It is very satisfying to figure out how to build your routes to rake in the cash and points! I also find the subdued presentation an absolute pleasure to look at while playing!

The 2-player game is not quite as good as the 4-player game, but it is definitely still enjoyable. Perhaps I will try the suggestion to use only 3 map tiles for 2 players. Overall, still an excellent game!

Very enjoyable from 1 to 4 players...have not tried 5 players, but I think it would be excellent as well.

Update: Tramways is a really special game. I really like the new rivers module in the Tramways of Small City expansion since it tightens up the board just a bit for 2 players. Excellent!

In Tramways, players are building and upgrading tracks, building and upgrading buildings, and delivering passengers. Players earn points for the upgrades and deliveries. The board is a random assortment of tiles, depending on player count, that shows mountains and lakes, existing buildings, and parcels that can convert to buildings as the game progresses. The game plays out over 6 rounds, each round having an auction, 3 actions per player and an administration phase. Each parcel has an accompanying card with varying actions and each player starts with four parcels and parcel cards, which gives everyone a different starting hand. 

The auctions in this game are unique and challenging to navigate. Not only are you auctioning for turn order, but also to add one of the auction cards to your hand. These cards can be bad and it is not uncommon to end up paying more money than the auction winner in order to avoid taking the bad card. The auction is brilliant and nasty. Building, upgrading and delivery actions require playing multiple action icons from your hand. Cards can have up to 5 action icons, which can be taken from multiple cards or from a single card at the cost of stress - which can subtract from your score at the end of the game. The hand management this brings also feels pretty unique as you balance cost and flexibility.

All of this is good fun, but the design is not perfect. Players might find that operating from a hand of cards for such a challenging game could be too limiting and tactical. The randomized map with random parcel ownership at set up could create choke points and imbalances that faster players can really take advantage of early, shutting other players out. I could readily see how some would find frustration in these aspects, but not me. I enjoy the tactical nature of using what I have and continually adjusting to opportunities on the fly. These aspects keep me from rating this as high as Age of Steam, but with a few unique and interesting twists, it is worth finding table time for Tramways as well.

Remeniscent of AoS but definitely its own animal, Tramways features a wonderfully tight and unique auction, track-building and pick-up&deliver by way of deck-building. The goal is to earn happiness and limit stress by delivering the locales to various locations across the board via your tram system. 

I really like the auctions here. Very interesting and far more intuitive than the reputation let's on. I like how you can build new buildings on plots obtain at the beginning and how each building offers a different bonus when passengers arrive. The track building is fun and the ability to use your opponents lines offers a nice element of mutualism and tension: I want to deliver x passenger to y building but in doing so I'll need to use Bob's line, pay him, and facilitate his earning of happiness. Also the random, double-sided board set is quite nice.

I'm not as fond of the deck-building and cards in general. They are fine and certainly not a deal breaker and I guess it works to further establish Tramways apart from AoS, but a part of me longs for just a set of actions to select from rather than hoping you draw the right card. 

My bigger issue is the results of adding layers of complexity to this AoS inspiration. The game has a fiddly set-up and at times game play. The rules have some rough patches that are hard for me to remember (though I'm getting better!). And the game seems to play longer than it should though that could just be a product of growing comfortable with the design.

Overall I recommend Tramways. Particularly to those looking for a new twist on the pick-up & deliver genre and for lovers of deck-building card restraints.

I don't understand the thinking behind the auction mechanism at all. It seems grossly unfair and makes it very hard for people late in turn order to get early. That's a shame, since the core network optimization problem is very interesting. We might do something like house rule an Age of Steam-style auction.

Tramways is a big step for Alban Viard as a designer.
He made great maps for Age of steam and made a couple of other games that I don't get to the table. Having read the rules the explanation of that was too daunting.. it didn't click.

Than he makes tramways. 
Tramways is to me an example of what boardgame design is and should be.

First he takes the hexagons from age of steam and turns them into squares.
Because of that two types of track suffice again. And he makes a simple crossing rule
Only straights can cross and corners can be on the same tile if they use all four sides.
This gives room for blocking.

The game starts with an auction and he makes an auction that even Knizia wouldn't dare to implement. It is well possible that the person who spend the least could win it and the person who spends the most could be in last spot.

The prize that you gain in an auction is big. It gives you turnorder and first choice of the available cards. And cards that are won in the auction go to your hand so you can use them.

The penalty of winning the auction is big too. You gain stress level which is basicly negative VP. 

In the auction you bid with cash on hand and with cash depicted in your cards in hand.
There are three phases in each round.
Phase 1: Bid
Phase 2: a) 1 action round; 2 action rounds
Phase 3: housekeeping 

Lets cut this short because it is starting to be a review.

The game is infinite replayable because you can put the map together anyway you please.
The deck building mechanism is solid. The importance of the cards shifts too. If you pick a card up in the first round. You might actually get that card four times. If you pick a card in the fifth round . You can use it once.
Because there is much open information in the game, the luck of the draw and how you deal with it will keep you allways on your toes.
You have some control over your deck being able to play cards or discard cards from your hand after the three action rounds in phase 2.

Cards can be used for multiple things in a single action. This gives stress but will open a lot of possibilities.

What the heck I am giving this a 9.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Well, Alban's rule sets are improving but there is still quite a bit of room for improvement. :-) This one is an interesting blend of Age of Steam and some deckbuilding via the auction/commerce cards. There is no way to trash cards and some cards from the auction set are really bad and literally clog one's hand. The auction is a bit odd how it is organized and really hard to teach. Cards potentially can be used in multiple ways for an action, but if done does cause stress to increase. Too much stress leads to a number of penalty points - huge numbers after the first couple steps. If you want more pain, you can use the harder side! 

I'm not certain I enjoyed my first experience but I can see where it will be fun in the future with people who understand the game and don't need to be taught. When teaching, I'd recommend using cards to show how to perform the different actions (IE, most, if not all actions, require use of multiple cards OR one card and taking stress by activating multiple action slots on said card).  

Points and money are largely gained via delivering passengers to different sites (which brings its own reward/penalty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'd never heard of this but walking past it caught my eye and they thankfully had a slot open for a teaching game. There's a comic book series I like called 'Mister X' which is about a retrofuturistic art deco dystopia in which the architecture of the city went wrong and now the city itself, despite its technological advances, is psychologically damaging to its inhabitants. Tramways could easily take place in this city. 

On its surface it's a straightforward track-laying pick-up-and-deliver game, but there are a lot of interesting thematic elements, including the fact that over-extending yourself (and even just going first in a round) causes "stress". Stress costs you VPs, so you need to work that down. As a bonus for me, the stress track ascends in a Fibonacci sequence. 

It's not going to fire any other games of its type, and although it does some interesting things, it's not extremely compelling. Yet there's something about it I really liked.

RATING: 5
The graphic design of the cards is pretty dire, but the game is good.  Not sure if there's a little too much going on between the auction and deckbuilding, but the deckbuilding really reminds me of Baseball Highlights more than anything - setting up your hand for the next turn rather than preparing for huge combos à la Dominion, Star Realms, etc.  The pickup-and-deliver game on the map is satisfying.

Does make me want to play Age of Steam quite a bit, with the admitted debt this game owes to that game.

One thing that I'm not a fan of is a big selling point for the game: the huge setup variability.  In games like Zimbabwe or Food Chain Magnate, the tiles can be drawn randomly, spun for orientation, and placed into a defined pattern per the rules.  Tramways allows any orientation of the map tiles, and there's a minimum parcel amount required based on player count, and there's easy/hard sides of each tile.  Setting up the game feels bad to me because of all the decisions to be made beforehand.  But that's the worst thing I can think of that this game does.

edit: I've now played Age of Steam and I can see a lot of reasons to play that game over this one.

Very interesting route building with rail tiles and buildings. The bad auction cards seem to be a bit too unforgiving for new players, especially when it is not known in first game the strategic importance of each type. The auction mechanism is interesting but seems unnecessarily complicated. Would have to play again to confirm if the fun on the map side is worth the other less pleasant bits.

Wow, his games keep getting better, but I suck so badly at them, not sure I have ever come anywhere but last place.  A lot to think about here.  Very tough to learn from the rules, and some things very counter-intuitive: for me, I never got a handle on the bidding.  I also got totally screwed by turn order at the end, so the last place guy got hammered even more.  Knowing a bit about the game was a huge advantage for JeroenD, who had played once before, so we had no chance, and takes a second run to put up any competition.  Hard to explain to a new player, but looking forward to exploring it more.

Nov '17: Tried solo, but I think I am not getting something.  Are there no available buildings to build?  Thus, no building action?  I don't get this at all.  Need to understand this better if I am to play solo again, but this was not a great experience.

Gioco molto interessante anche se la componentistica è sempre discutibile. Per molti aspetti sembra quasi un gioco della Splotter, profondo e gradevole ma con un tabellone da prototipo. Il gioco si divide in tre fasi: asta iniziale molto particolare, che rende al meglio in 4 o 5 giocatori; fase azioni dove ogni giocatore ne effettua 1 e poi 2, e quindi rendite di fine turno, Un gioco che offre la giusta interazione ma che necessita anche di una buona dose di programmazione e strategia. Personalmente lo trovo gradevole e da esplorare.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Going into this game it seemed simple enough, but boy was I wrong. What lies beneath a very straight forward rule set [i](once you play through a few rounds)[/i] is a very difficult game to play. Decisions need to be carefully thought out, with actions being planned in advance. I really enjoyed the route building, passenger delivery aspect of the game. 

There is a lot to explore in Tramways and in future plays I could completely focus on my strategy without having to worry about learning the rules. You definitely need to approach the first game as a learning game and explore how to plan out your turns in order to accomplish your goal. 

The only aspect of the game I don't necessarily enjoy are the auctions. I understand they serve to create a tight economy. Having to determine a value for first place, or avoiding last place, is a tense decision. It's exacerbated when things spiral out of control and you blow a lot more money than you planned. Still it just wasn't particularly fun and felt quite punishing at times. Still, I'm really looking forward to trying this again, hopefully in the near future. It also has solo rules, so if it continues to grow on me I'd consider getting a copy.[/i]

Tramways is a ok game, but is too punishing for my taste. The auction mechanism has a poker feel to it and can be harsh. The stress mechanism feels a bit tacked on though it is probably necessary for balance.  I am also not a fan of the artwork used in the game itself, mind you the art on the box itself is quite good. The game itself looks like a homemade prototype.   The cards in particular look quite bland.  Many parts of the game are interesting and well done, but this is overall not a game I would choose to play.

RATING: 8
Tramways is a game that takes the track-building and delivery system from Age of Steam and adds in a deckbuilding element.  Players expand their rail networks to link both public and private squares on the board and deliver passengers to various colored squares for different benefits.  The deckbuilding element feels a little like Mage Knight in that all of the cards are multi-use, and you have to puzzle out how to best use the cards that you've drawn each turn.  Each turn begins with a strange auction that determines both turn order and order of taking new cards from a display--some cards have negative value which makes the auction more significant.  While players can earn points throughout the game through building and upgrading both their track and their squares, a significant number of points comes from saving money earned from deliveries (and not spent on the auction) for deliveries to red squares, which let players exchange money for points with triangular diminishing returns.  There is also a stress track that increases for making certain deliveries or winning the auction which can be worth a lot of negative points if not managed correctly.  While there is a lot to criticize here between the rulebook, graphic design, and lack of player aids, the gameplay itself really shines--this is a harsh game that truly rewards careful planning and clever play.  That sort of thing is really in my wheelhouse--I really enjoyed this one.

--The structure of the rulebook sucks. It's one of the first times I had to look at an instruction video to understand the rules. It also doesn't help that expert rules are between 'normal' rules: at least put those in shaded boxes or even better put them at the end of the rulebook so you have a nice, clean overview of all the changes when playing expert-mode.
- The quality of the components/artwork ain't that great, while this game costs a lot of money. Especially the 'flea money' is a big downer for me, it's by far the worst kind of money (even paper money if by far better), especially here as the copper and gold resemble each other a lot  under certain light conditions.
- Don't play your first game with 4 and certainly not with 5: it will simply take ages as you have to figure it all out.
+-: the auction mechanism is unique, that's for sure, but does it add value to the game? I doubt it, as it's quite hard to understand/explain to others and it feels more like a 'negative' auction: it seems to be more important to not become last then being first. It also seems (too) hard to get away from last position as you can't bid the same amount.
+ It's a gamers game: for me it's a sort of implementation of deckbuilding into Age of Steam/Steam/Railways of the World.

On a phlegmatic night, I was happy to play Tramways, despite the accompanying ‘heavy game’ caveat: but, like many weighty games, it’s actually not too complex once you get going, although it did take time to arrive at that destination and we only started playing proper about 45 minutes after deciding on the game.
This is an Age Of Steam-esque (so I'm told) route-builder and passenger-delivery game, which uses a smidgeon of deck-building alongside a fairly brutal auction. I’ve never been a fan of auctions in games, but despite its counter-intuitive nature, this auction makes sense in the context of the game. Its importance was a bit of a mixed bag: the regular winner got the best cards, but a lot of stress (negative points); the regular loser got some truly dreadful cards, but kept his money. There is no catch-up mechanism, just a slap in the face for being first in turn order.
After that, there are two phases of building, which grant great flexibility in card use and, although the ugly board looks like it’ll clog up quickly, there was a fair amount of space for all concerned to build their routes. Not that doing so was made easy for those with poor cards (or a bad shuffle), which was a little disappointing for a game about route-building and moving passengers. Rinse repeat another 5 times and there’s the game done.
As an open design, Tramways could potentially be very fragile: I could see players who are out of the running turn to other in-game diversions and the fact that you can run a passenger through others' stations, granting them points, would allow for a large degree of king-making. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a fascinating mutation of the steam system. In this game, you lay track down on square pieces rather than hexes, with the goal of delivering people to different destinations on the board. You get a different bonus, depending on which type of place you sent the passenger to. Not only that, but the whole game is fueled through deckbuilding and your deckbuilding opportunities are heavily based on an intense auction for turn order. I love the mechanism where you can get extra use from your cards if you take on "stress" which if not solved, gives you negative points at the end of the game. The map is randomized each play, so you never get the same setup, and the size also adjusts based on the number of players, so it works well with any number.

Partially this game just isn't for me. I don't love games where you have to manage cards to determine what actions are available to you. I much prefer to just be able to choose what action I think is best for me out of a choice of actions that everyone else gets to pick from as well, rather than each player being a little limited in what they might be able to accomplish. It makes much of the game the players fighting with their hands rather than competing against each other focusing on doing exactly what they'd most like to. 

The auctions in this game are very unique and they are quite fun, but for such a meaty game they often felt unpredictable and very punishing. You could easily pay a lot and still wind up in an awful spot. 

Finally there are just lots of little odd exceptions here and there and a few strange rules. To me it feels like a game that hasn't been pared down enough by a developer to really question every element and squeeze out all the extraneous bits. 

Overall I'll play again if asked to, but in general would rather spend my time exploring other games. This one just doesn't really get me and I don't feel like putting in the time exploring the strategic depths it surely offers.

The auction in this game is really innovative, the actions may cause a brain meltdown, as there are many possibilities. Definitely a game I need to play a couple of times to get the hang of it.

Nice game about creating the net of building interconnected with tramways rails and links. Lot of interaction there as map could easily get crowded and there is not much space to place rails. Also, players can use other players tramways links when shifting passangers (paying money to the owner every time passanger use the link). Great variety guaranteed by modular board and available map expansion (New York and Paris)

Solo experience is missing that tension created by players, but still a lot of fun from creating the tramways links and maximazing victory points (happinnes points).

Update: Rating rised to 9. When I have first played this game, I thought it is good. After several plays, I think it is great.

--Jun2017-- This is quite cool.  A lovely crunch logistics puzzle, with huge interplayer interference.   The auction is still (for me) more terrifying than manageable; but the game puzzle is challenging and intriguing.

Expansions: Paris & New York, 2017 Expansions

Just played the once but I'm kinda hooked. Took us a while to figure out and we missed a ton of little things during the game (Mostly that should have been having us racking up stress faster than we were), but when you get into it there's a great amount of stuff to think about and really burn your brain.

Super excited to get more plays in and see if this can earn a higher yet rating =-D

Several plays solo, plus some 2er/4er

This is an interesting network-building pick-up-and-deliver game like Age of Steam, with a bit of deck-building/hand management mixed in as well as a twisted, weird turn order auction! Goods delivery is easier in some ways (minimal color restrictions) but also maybe less reliable (other players can more easily steal them and passengers could be in short supply). Goods (passenger) production is nicely done: it is simple and predictable, without the dice some people hate in AoS. And it's cool that you have a modular board made of random tiles in a multitude of configurations (with a harder terrain setup on the backs). However:
- Track building feels weirdly constrained, I think because the map uses a square grid instead of a hexagonal one.
- The game feels kind of clunky and in need of streamlining. For example, the rules for building through a parcel are odd, as is the 3-step process of how to resolve moving a passenger to a destination building. And did I mention the weird auction rules?
- Those void cards, and cards with "consequences", seem gratuitously brutal. I'm pretty sure I'd rather just play without them!
- Why the heck didn't they include USEFUL player aids??

I have generally enjoyed my plays, but I'm not sure how often I'll come back to this over other games of this type.

One of the nominated games for Jogo do Ano. It's a very different design, published by a small publisher but proving that indie games can be as good as others.
It's a raw design with a brilliant auction mechanism.

RATING: 6.5
Players build networks of track and deliver passengers across them, with segment owners earning both money (generally 1 per track tile) and points (1 per link). 

The first key differentiator is the use of multi-use cards. Most actions require using at least two symbols, which can be played from the same or multiple cards, but using more than one icon from the same card results in "stress" (eventually a significant point loss). Most spaces on the board reserved for building are associated with unique parcel cards, drafted at the start of the game, each of which also has a different set of action icons, so the draft needs to be informed by both action strategy and positioning

The second key novelty is the bizarre all-pay-all-of-the-time auction where players pay the full cost of each new bid. It's extremely vicious, in part because as well as turn order players are bidding for choice of cards. All players [i]must[/i] acquire a card and some provide severe penalties.

On initial read-through I thought that Tramways had more in common with Age of Steam -- for which the designer has previously created many maps -- than it actually does. The ability to play large numbers of track icons at once makes contortions possible for additional money and/or blocking that are unreasonably inefficient in most route-building games, and the four parcel entrances make that blocking more effective.

This does make for interesting and exciting strategic options, but contributes to making decisions around action economy -- which combination of these 25 icons will get me the best result over 3 actions? -- painful, with consequent downtime. The luck factor can also have an impact because there are no opportunities for trashing or other card control and some icons are rather scarce.

These are minor qualms but I also have more significant issues with other parts of the design. In particular, I have become convinced that the penalty cards (particularly the one with no benefit and cost in money + stress) actively make the game worse. That is not to say that I do not like sharp edges in an auction, but the penalty is too high, particularly in the first turn. Turn order is already a significant advantage without lumbering the loser(s) with a permanent disadvantage.

Compounding the problem is the instability of the auction; it's nice in theory but I'm not sure what it actually adds other than to make outcomes highly swingy. I am inclined to think that re-using the auction from Age of Steam would result in a strictly better game.

There's a lot to love here, but as with Small City et al I am left wishing that some of the ideas had been left for an expansion.

RATING: 8.5
Really tight game that encourages smart play and inventive use of cards, moves and actions, possibly even more so than its daddy, Age Of Steam. The rules are fairly straight forward once you've got them down, although remembering all of the actions you need to do something is a little bit of a challenge. A really rewarding and challenging game to play, one of the very best, and also a fantastic solo experience.

RATING: 9
Very tense game. Replayability is almost infinite. There are so many strategy paths, your head may explode (in a good way, tough decisions galore). The game is difficult to learn at first (and a bit of a bear to teach), but once fathomed it's quite smooth.

Martin Wallace "coins" are the only production let down. Also, I almost wish that the game lasted 7 rounds instead of 6 in order to enhance the deck-building element (there are enough cards to do so, except at the highest player count).

The 'stress' mechanic is very clever. Note that there is no way to purge bad cards from your deck (i.e., you're stuck with them), but such cards really help drive the auction mechanic. 

A nifty solitaire puzzle, as well (playable in about 30 minutes).

Be forewarned, players can easily be prone to some AP with this game. Even then, it's easy to make mistakes or have opponents wreck you strategy, so roll with the punches.

Anyway, a phenomenal game that is the jewel in the designer's crown! Tramways has become a favorite amongst our group.

Another clever gem from Alban Viard. Has elements of deck building, hand management, route building and pick up and deliver, wrapped up in an age of steam style setting, where you build the map as the game progresses. 

As with all Viard's games, the rules are dense, and the game is mathy and thinky, but all that brain exertion is rewarded with a intriguing experience that will stand up to repeated plays and create a different experience each time.

RATING: 6.8
tl;dr: good, rather heavy but too many rules

I'm not sure why, but this game just has a lot of rules. It doesn't really feel like that when you're playing, that's relatively straight forward, but explaining it does take a fair amount of time. More than it should, was my feeling.
This is a route building game, and I enjoy those. There's also some pick up and deliver thing going on. A bit like [thing=4098][/thing] or [thing=17133][/thing] in fact.
One thing that did bother me, was that the game can be broken from the setup, and there seems to be no fix for that. I ended up only having yellow and green cards, so I could never deliver to red (for lots of points) or blue (to get cards to expand my abilities). We remedied this on the first turn by swapping one of my cards for one that gave me red, and that helped, but still, my opening cards gave me very few options.
Other than that, I think the game works fine and it's heavier than I expected.

Initial rating: 6.8/10

Tramways is an interesting twist on the pick-up and deliver game. The game is card based and there is a deck building element.

Each round there's a wonky auction. You either drop out or bid an amount of money (paid immediately). You can't bid the same amount as any player who was earlier than you in turn order the previous turn. When it gets back to you, if you're the highest bid you take the highest spot left (and the new start player gets a stress). If you're not the highest bid left, then you can either drop out or make a new bid (paid immediately) which can be lower than your initial bid. (Bids never have to be higher than anyone else's which is a bit weird) This keeps going around until everyone drops out or takes the highest spot left.

Then in turn order everyone takes a card from a display of cards (equal to number of players).

Then in turn order every player takes one action. Then every player takes two more actions. Actions can be building track, upgrading track, building buildings, upgrading buildings, moving passengers or just taking 2 bucks.

Like many pick up and deliver games you get points for every link you move a passenger through. You also get money for each rail piece that is used. You also trigger an effect depending which building you go to, which can get you more cards or money, reduce stress, allow you to buy victory points or get a worker meeple back (which is needed to build stuff).

One twist to this game is that the actions you can do is tied to the symbols on the cards in your deck. Cards often have multiple symbols you can use, but normally you use one of them. You can use more than one, but that costs you stress. The more you increase your stress the more it hurts you at game end (if you don't reduce it).

After the round is over, you draw up to your hand size and hope you got the cards you needed for the next round.

I'm usually not that great at pick up and deliver games, and I proved that again here. I totally neglected the whole "build a network" aspect of the game and that hurt a lot. I also bought a bunch of cards and consequently rarely drew the cards I was looking for. Despite that, I enjoyed the game. It looks like it has a lot of variability and replay value.

It is easy to see Alban Viard loves Age of Steam and has designed many maps for it. Tramways is certainly inspired by it but has less focus on the financial side. There is still tracklaying but it's not as cutthroat as in AoS and you can only build on your own plots. The heart of Tramways is route-building and deck-building/hand management with multiple use of cards. A mechanism I love so I also like Tramways a lot. It feels heavier than Small City because of the card play but both are excellent games. 

Expansion: Tramways Expansion - Paris/New York.

Having only played solo, I can only comment on that. That said, my experience isn't making me eager to play it competitively with friends, as adding an auction isn't a mechanic that tips the balance. This was boring. And the pieces were crap. Those coins? And the slightest bump moved all the tracks and such. Would it have broken the bank to draw tracks on the pieces? Either the solo setup is broken, or the scoring is stupid. There's exactly one track upgrade and two building upgrades in the 30 card auction deck. Solo, they might as well not even exist. And without them, best you'll probably get is 50 or so points. But extreme luck swings that up by 30 points or so? I think I read here someone call this soulless, I couldn't agree more.

Wow, so much to think about as you play! Our first play (4p) took nearly 3 hours, but I spent almost all of the downtime deliberating and planning. Can't wait for more!

[b]1p:[/b] The solitaire game is juicy and appetizing, thinky without inducing self-paralyzing analysis, and fun. Not too bad to set up (once you have the hang of Tramways setup), either, which I feel is very important for a solitaire game. If I spend 40 minutes setting something up, my window of opportunity likely has closed. This game is just great! Also, the "game of chicken" that replaces the auction works very nicely.

[b]5p:[/b] I heard complaints about the brutally cruel auction, and the terrible cards with which some folks may get stuck in the auction. I feel these are good elements that offer a different incentive to bid; however, I think one could cull the best cards to use with such plaintiffs, and still have a fun play with them. I don't yet see a way to soften the auction for such people, though.

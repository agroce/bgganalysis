Must have one of the best production values out there. The Days of Wonder edition from 2013 is just amazing to look at.

In the game, you are trying to plan your turns so that you can pick up the most treasures with the least number of actions. This translates into a lot of scavenging and rushing tactics. Not too exciting for its lack of depth but may be good for occasional fun.

Too bad the gameplay does not quite reach the level of the components. I guess the game is best played with 8-12 year old kids who can already plan ahead but do not have a long enough of an attention span to play anything longer.

RATING: 9.5
Excellent game. Giving it a skeptic's ten despite a couple of concerns about setup being annoying, and the high number of simple rules with small exceptions (only 5 food allowed, only 1 white tile of each type (and can't use the old tile once you've seen the new tile), must stop in base camp, can't use your 1 unexplored move in the middle of your turn, always use rations to take actions EXCEPT with relics, only one toolbox action per turn, so on, so forth)

Even with all that fiddly baggage, the game is easy to teach (move and explore!), plays quickly, and allows you to sink as much planning into it as you want to. This may have replaced TtR as my go-to gateway game, and it's certainly more of a "gamers' game" feel than TtR, having many of the same mechanisms as more complex route-building or pick-up-and-deliver games. It probably serves as a better gateway into the hobby than TtR which is essentially rummy with bells on and doesn't open too many doors, mechanically.

RATING: 8
Really neat strategy game that draws its fun from strategy buildup. You spend several turns setting yourself up for a big move, and it is so rewarding if you pull it off. Simple turn structure (move, explore) makes it easy to teach but multiple paths to victory (temple powers, skill trees, and relics) present room for ample strategy. Thinky, the perfect length, and very engaging. Some rules are tough to remember, and it feels fiddly at times, but the route-building strategy turns the game into a living puzzle, and a real winner.

While the flow of this game is actually quite fast once you get going, it is surprisingly rules-heavy for a Days of Wonder game. Yet once you have it down, it works so well. It might feel scripted for some players at first, because you are almost compelled to start building up a network of paths before spending too much time exploring. Yet how you will arrange those paths and move them around so that you can snatch up relics later in the game is actually a lot of fun. I also love being able to acquire several little special abilities through the ivory and purple tiles. It starts to make each player unique and gives them their own way of playing and special things to shoot for at the end of the game. While my wife is not enamored with the game, I find it really enjoyable, and always get excited when I have a chance to play it.

I was anticipating Relic Runners but, after (and while) playing it, it didn’t impress me at all: you never feel like you’re recovering relics from ancient temples as much as you feel all you’re doing over and over is just managing your resources, optimizing your point grinding and shifting your road pieces.

Thematically it’s nil: and theme is everything in a game.

Fun family game.  I had trouble tracking points...but it was only the first game. Watching other players points and strategies would come with further plays.

I like it...I would buy it again in a heart beat...good with the kids...can see it being cutthroat with just adults.

Maybe a bit to complex for non-gamers, but it's worth a try :)

Like it, you just have to expect there is a big dose of randomness (mostly what the other players do), and the more players the less control you have.

I picked up Relic Runners based on Days of Wonder's track record and some early, positive reviews. And after playing it once, what I think the game offers is a very approachable game of route connecting and jockeying for position. The game reminds me of a family-friendly version of Maharaja... another game I really like.

Relic Runners is not as approachable as, say, Ticket to Ride. But it does play surprisingly smooth. This is still family gaming for the family that games fairly frequently. What notches up the complexity level is a few nitpicky rules and exceptions, along with more iconography and special tiles, and a very modest "tech tree" of sorts. Still, on your turn, you mostly move and optionally do an action, so turns can move pretty quick.

I'm excited to see what the rest of my family thinks.

Update: Actually, I ended up trading this away. It's not a bad game... upon reflection, the theme doesn't exactly mesh with the mechanics. I'd happily play it, but I didn't see anyone really excited by this title.

Although it looks intimidating with the amount of components and symbols at play, gameplay itself is really rather simple.

The latest luxurious release from Days of Wonder combines some familiar mechanisms but adds unique elements resulting in a game with surprisingly strategic depth.

Players are moving around the board exploring and trying to establish known paths to ease movement later (very Alan Moon-esque).  They also are discovering three types of temples which offer progressively better benefits.  When a temple or ruin is all gone, a relic appears.  Race from one color of relic to a matching one and snatch it, while scoring points for the length of your run!  To keep players in check, you spend a ration for each exploration, which can only be picked up at base camp.  Players can also build up abilities (think Goa or Hansa Tuetonica) to aid in future turns - but once you use it, you lose it.

This is a fun game that's pretty easy to explain, but has enough to puzzle over that it will keep experienced gamers happy.  In particular the fact that you can't run through base camp presents a tough mental challenge.  The length is just about right, and as you'd expect, the bits are superb.

The face-down temple tiles make this rather more of a see-what-happens game than I tend to like, but the path construction is more predictable and seems fairly valuable. If you wanted more strategy, I'd imagine you could play with the topmost tile of each temple always being face-up?

RATING: 7
Components: The board is attractive. The relics are very cool (even cooler than the ones in Forbidden Island and Fantastiqa). The ruins bother me; they are enormous round tiles that contain no information except the picture of a road. They could have been much smaller. Also, it's inelegant how large the tiles are, necessitating that we land our pawns on them, yet we must then lift up our pawns to retrieve the tile. The food bags and explorer pawns are cool molds, but they felt like cheap plastic. The pawns are not gender neutral, but the play mats can be flipped from male to female sides; very cool technique that all games should employ.

Experience: At first I really liked it. So many options, so much to discover. But soon the board becomes sparse and everything becomes really difficult. I found myself stranded in an area of the board that was cleared of it's resources. Also, I got sniped on relics several times which really stung. Despite all that, I got a really lucky tile in the end that gave me an extra turn, allowing me to tie for the win. Very capricious.

Players are Indiana Jones type characters, exploring a jungle and uncovering ruins and temples, trying to score victory points.  Mechanically simple game where players take turns moving and optionally exploring.  Moving must happen, and can be any distance along explored paths (think Ticket To Ride track laid out across the board) and one segment along an unexplored path.  Then, they may explore their location they stop in - ruins allow a path piece to be placed, and temples flip a tile given them some sort of ability or victory points.  

When a temple is fully explored, a relic pops up - insanely gorgeous plastic figurines, which can be recovered by taking a special turn - a relic run.  

On top of this, players are managing a simple technology tree of bonus powers, which can be used any time to further their cause.  The game ends when a specific number of relics have been recovered from the board - most points wins.

Perfectly fine game that sits boldly in the middle of "okay".  First off, it's Days of Wonder, so it is gorgeous - no surprise there.  Second, it's Days of Wonder, so it's average - again no shock.  The game is difficult to peg, almost as if it is trying to be a gamer's game and family game at the same time.  The game is quite chaotic with four players, as you try to set up a strategy, only to find you are gifting moves to the players further around the table to you.  Two player was much more fun in terms of formulating plans, but the interaction suffered.  

Perfectly okay, but lost in a sea of truly excellent late 2013 games (Legacy, Nations, Caverna, Russian Railroads, and I could go on...).

Really like this game. Fun components and theme. Mechanics are solid and I like planning ahead and building an epic route. I wish it was a bit easier to teach, some of the mechanics are not super intuitive. Sometimes the end game triggers can catch new players off guard. Players who have played before will definitely have a strong advantage over new players.

RATING: 6
A pretty simple momement and path-laying game which accelerates nicely as players are able to move faster and faster as the game progresses.   I like how players can have up to three toolboxes moving up their tech tree, and they can choose when to trigger them and start moving up the ladders again.   Over-produced a little bit, but that is part of its charm.   Might not be a long-term keeper, but I'd like to play it a few more times.

RATING: 7.5
Meglepően játszható játékról van szó, a megszokott minőségi alkatrészekből. Jómagam rosszabra számítottam, habár gémeri mélységeket nem kell várni a játéktól, de a családi kategóriában megállja a helyét a maga felfedezős jellegével. A játékban romokat, templomokat, később sírhelyeket fedezünk fel. A romok az "útvonalak" fejlesztéséhez kell, a templomok különböző hosszú vagy rövidtávú kedvezményeket vagy direkt győzelmi pontokat biztosítanak, míg a sírhelyeken ereklyéhez juthatunk, amennyiben végrehajtjuk az ereklye expedíciót. Ezen kívül még létezik egy háromsávos plusz akciókat biztosító "táblázat", amelyen minél előrébb juttatjuk a szerszámos ládánkat, annál kedvezőbb akcióhoz juthatunk. A játéknak van egy kicsi nyelvfüggősége, de egy magyar segédlettel ez a probléma könnyen áthidalható, így családoknak is könnyen ajánlható. (2016.12.25.)

RATING: 6.5
This is a marvellous route-building game.  It looks to me like sales have been poor, especially given its Days of Wonder status.  I am really surprised by this as it fills that rare gap: a Euro strategy game of good depth that can be played in an hour.  In weight it is tougher to understand than Ticket To Ride, perhaps more similar to DOW's Collosseum but played in half the time.  Like TTR kids can join the adults, but I'd say 10+ rather than 8+ for TTR.  It lacks some of the tension and ticket-drawing surprise of TTR but instead you have to make tough decisions on when and where to build your routes.  Do you make an early grab for ruins (routes) or explore the temples and your tech tree for other benefits?

And the components are, as you would expect from DOW, terrific.

So Relic Runners joins a rare elite of solid 4/5 player one hour strategy games.  Not much else in that group. For 5 players: TTR, Ra, Medici, and Pelopennes; Palaces of Carrera, Coal Baron and Asara play 4.  All are of a similar complexity.

Definitely a keeper.

Tematikus felfedezős napunk volt (Relic Runners után egy régi kedvenc, a már kb 6 éve elő sem került Mykerinos,(na ja 4 személyes) dzsungelből Egyiptomba, de marad a régészet, kincsvadászat. A végén még egy TTR-E, ami persze úgy tűnik kilóg, de azért annyira még sem, ez is az a korszak :-))
A játékmenet:
1. kötelező lépni: azaz el kell hagynunk az aktuális romot-szentélyt-templomot.
2. a lépés trükkös: 1 ismeretlen ösvényen mehetünk, és vagy előtte vagy után egy saját tetszőleges hosszúságú ismert ösvényen. (Alapban ismeretlen ösvényekkel van teli a dzsungel.)
Utána ahova megérkeztünk, és van elemózsiánk, akkor felfedezhetünk. Ez nem kötelező elem, nem kötelező felfedezni, de fontos, h mindig csak a mozgás után lehet, és csak 1 szintet. A felfedezett szint akcióját nem kötelező végrehajtani, de többnyire hasznos és érdemes.
A romok feltárásával lehet csak ösvényeket lerakni -pontosabban 1 romszint - 1 ösvény- illetve a szerszámosládával is lehet, de az a ritkább.
A saját ösvények fontosak: részben ez kell ahhoz h ereklyét szerezzünk. Itt egy pontosítás: nem végig sajáton kell menni ereklyétől ugyanolyan ereklyéig, h megszerezzük, hanem a normál mozgás szerint, azaz saját + 1 ismeretlen is lehet. Mivel az út csapás száma számít a pontozásnál, ez fontos: +2 pont.
A templomok, romok
3 féle (3 szín) templom van, plusz a rom.
Lila templomok: mindig látszik az aktuális legfelső szintje, azaz lehet tudni, h mit szerzünk meg ha odamegyünk. (ezek ilyen segéd dolgok: plusz szerszámosláda, ösvény áthelyezés, pont, stb)
Kék templomok: előre nem látjuk, hogy mit szerzünk és nem is kell megmutatni. Ezeken pontok vannak 1-5 közt.
Csontszínű templomok: ezeket sem látjuk előre. De felvétel után fel kell olvasni, el kell mondani mi az. Azonos szintűből nem lehet 2. DE, nem helyette kapunk 2 pontot, hanem ha ugyanolyan szintet szerzünk, akkor a 2 lapkából eldöntjük, h melyiket tartjuk meg, a másikat dobjuk (sőt ha végrehajtható a dobott, akkor akár végre is hajthatjuk) és kapunk még 2 pontot is.
Csontszínűek fontosak: vannak játék végén plusz pontot adók (a legfelső szint lapkái), vannak 1x végrehajthatóak -középső szint- és utána dobásra kerülők. És a legalsó szint permanens képességet ad a játék végéig, vagy ha másik ilyen szintű nem lesz és dobjuk.
Romok: ösvényeket rakhatunk le vele.
Mindegyik típushoz másik fajta ereklye tartozik/kerül. (Ha teljes feltárásra kerül.)

Az ereklyeszerzés igen fontos: sok-sok pont szerezhető vele egy kellően hosszan kiépített csapássorral. Ami még fontos: a romok-templomok feltáráshoz elemózsia kell,  viszont az ereklye felvételhez nem kell elemózsiát eldobni.

Szintén fontos, a sok ereklye: amennyi különböző: annyiszor 5 pont a végén. Azonosakért nem jár semmi. (kivéve ha nincs az embernél az a csontszínű templomlapka ami épp az azonosakért ad pontot.)
Ugyanakkor persze megéri felvenni az azonosokat is: az útvonal hossz X 2 pont az nagyon-nagyon sok.

A kaja nagyon fontos: én rápróbáltam arra, h nem mentem vissza ételért az alaptáborba, hanem más módon próbáltam intézni. Nos utolsó lettem :-). Igaz csak részben ezért. Mert h lehet a szerzsámosládák-folyó utak kombóval megoldani kaja helyett a felfedezéseket, és 1x-1x beleférhet, de sokat nem érdemes kint tartózkodni kaja nélkül.
Illetve a romokat, amikkel ösvénykehez lehet jutni csak kajával lehet felfedezni.

A csontszínű templomok sajnos nyelvfüggőek. Eléggé. Viszont annyira azért nem vészes, mert úgyis fel kell olvasni, meg kell mutatni, és akkor meg lehet nézni, beszélni mi az.

A játék: a csapatnak nagyon tetszett: igaz most nem a gémer szekció volt :-).
Nekem is tetszett: családi játék kategória, és h miket találunk a templomok szintjeiben az tisztán szerencse, viszont úgy tűnik, h jól van kiegyensúlyozva. Persze ettől még nagyon nem mindegy mit talál az ember, de hát ugye erről szól kincsvadászat. :-)

Könnyed, kedves, lekötő, izgalmas rohangászás, ahol persze sokszor keresztbe lehet tenni apróságokkal a másiknak, pont az veszem fel, pont arra megyek, stb... de nem véres dráma.
A játékidő tarthatónak tűnik.
A kialakítás szép, a szokásos DOW minőség, és az ereklyék jól néznek ki.
Újrajátszhatóság: a templomokból több van mint a táblára kerül, minden szín, minden szintjéből azt hiszem 2-vel több, tehát mindig más kombó van a táblán, plusz csak a romok helye fix a táblán, a templomok véletlenszerűen kerülnek fel, így ahol ma egy lila templom van, ott holnap már egy kék.

A nyelvfüggőség nem szép, de ettől még tökéletes családi játék kategória.

Nice bits, and uses the Passenger mechanism from TTR Marklin (which I like), but a bit fiddly for what it is. And yet again, lacking in any real inter-action apart from Choice Denial, which I don't really like. The path laying was nice, it has nice bits, but it seemed much more a family game, and so under-whelmed me somewhat.

One two player game only, but I do like what this seems to offer. It plays better than suggested by a rules read. A preliminary 8 (July 2014). UPDATE: There is just something about this game that leaves me completely cold.  Whilst the production  of the relics is excellent, the connecting paths just look like trains (a bit out of theme).  The rule book is not the normal DoW clarity, and the game itself I find quite themeless - it might as well be an abstract with various rules just mashed together.  I am also never a fan of games with unique special abilities where there are a number of them and it is never clear what exactly you apponent can do as the ability is a small text on a card in front.  Add to that the luck nof the draw with searching and a tech tree which seems to let you get more points for the longest route (using double points) that almost negates the need to relic run in the first place, and I am not enamoured.  So, whilst I really want to like it, I will never ask to play it, and will probably offer alternates if asked (Rating: 4.824, Nov 16) UPDATE: Gone (Jan 17)

Pretty fun, simple game with cool looking pieces. It's a bit weird that you have to move from 1 relic to another relic of the same kind before you're allowed to actually claim a relic. (I'm standing right in front of a relic - why would I run to the other side of the jungle to grab some other completely identical relic?)

Nice family game with a very thin but cool "Indiana Jones" style theme. A few fiddly rules and the variety of special powers, both from temple tiles and character sheets, may be a bit overwhelming for its target audience, but the gameplay would suffer without them. It's not a very elegant game, but it works well and doesn't overstay its welcome. The relics look fantastic and probably push my rating up a bit, but the player pieces feel very cheap and are some of the worst-looking miniatures I have ever seen.

Days of Wonder-style production value, for sure.  The game can be a little frustrating because it's quite difficult to set things up in a way that helps you rather than your opponents. The scarcity of roads and the food mechanism also make things a little difficult. I suspect that once you get good enough at the game to negotiate these problems well, it will cease to be interesting. (1 play)

A below average game in my opinion.  Not terrible, but the game never seems to get going.  The start of the game is just about racing for the Ruin tiles so you can get your trails on the board, then you just move around and mop up the relics.  This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but it just felt that the game was lacking in strategy.

Players are relic hunters exploring temples and ruins, building their own tracks through the jungle and gaining special skills on the fly. Whoever brings home the most valuable loot, wins. 

Somehow, Relic Runners reminds me of [gameid=40214] which features a similar map and movement although Relic Runners isn't about pickup-and-delivery. It might be the puzzle-like nature of figuring out the best move. Clever network building is the key to collecting the most valuable sets of items. Luck plays its part but it's on an acceptable level for the light to medium depth and length of the game.

Compared to the DoW standard in components and artwork, it doesn't meet the high expectations. While in actual gameplay it's perfectly workable, especially the drab game board is a letdown.

While it's a good game, it suffers from an unlucky combination of a high price, nothing new differentiating it from the mass of other good games and being too light for seasoned gamers, making it highly unlikely to show up in my gaming circles.

Does feel at moments like Ticket to Ride, but it really isn't - at all.  While you do need to 'complete routes' in order to score relics, you are juggling the tech tree, the location powers, and your rations to accomplish your goals.  While I appreciate the interplay between the different elements, it has not been a hit with our family.

RATING: 7
A little bit fiddly rules at first. Maybe not the best way to explain them. Different temples, ruins, shrines... O maybe I wasn't paying attention to details. But once you explain them to others, everything starts to make sense. During my first play I didn't quite grasp the game. I don't know, if I was playing well or not. It seems that route exploration is important, but I managed to win the first game with only four routes on the board. I don't know what to do next time. Nevertheless, I had some fun. The theme is engaging and the gorgeous statues (relics) make you feel like you are really exploring something.

Pirmą kartą skaitant, truputį painios taisyklės. Gal būt paaiškintos ne pačiu geriausiu būdu. Skirtingos šventyklos, griuvėsiai, šventavietės... Arba aš ne pakankamai atidžiai jas skaičiau. Neskaitant to, pradėjus jas aiškinti kitiems viskas stoja į savo vietas. Pirmojo žaidimo metu taip ir nesugebėjau suprasti žaidimo. Nežinau, ar žaidžiau gerai, ar nelabai. Atrodytų, kad kelių tyrinėjimas yra labai svarbus, bet pirmąjį žaidimą laimėjau vos su keturiais keliais. Nežinau, ką daryti kitą kartą. Bet vis dėl to, žaisti buvo pakankamai smagu. Įtraukianti tema ir fantastiškos statulėlės (relikvijos) leidžia pajusti, kad tikrai bandai kažką atrasti.

Very enjoyable and beautiful game. The strategies are not apparent at first blush so it's not the greatest "gateway", yet with a couple of plays it is quite intuitive and can see it being a staple family game. I especially like that it seems like there are two parts (laying rails and relic running) that bleed into each other throughout the game.

Definitely a game which I like and would love to play more... BUT it drops in the middle of the grey areabetween gamers game and the family game and that's the problem here. I can't see the situation where we might play this enough in my regular gamegroup AND the rules are too complicated to teach them to my family or casual gamers - and the special cards and rules doesn't make it any easier. So, no reason to buy this nice game.

In Relic Runners, each player takes on the role of a character keen to exploit and acquire relics that have been unearthed in a long lost part of the jungle. Each would-be archaeologist has a colorful past — retired university professor, former army captain, etc. — and wants to be the first to get their hands on the precious loot to earn the most victory points.

After a video review seems very abstract, path movement game. Very euroish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very interesting pathways network building game. Whenever you explore a location that benefits you, it also accelerates or allows a relic to appear at that location.  Group think is important in this game.

After a few plays, I'm wondering what are good ways to counter one player who is just focusing on long Green relic runs.  By creating loops, one dominate Green relic runner can try for lengthy Green relic runs of 8 or more.  This is a "boring" strategy but highly effective when opponents are allowing Green relics to appear.

What a surprise this game is. Once you get past the Cleopatara-level chrome, there's quite a good game underneath.

It's a logistical exercise of trying to juggle increasing your movement, collecting bonuses, and setting up the collection of relics; the latter of which you'd normally like to be at antother player's expense.

What you end up with is something a bit more brain burny than DoW has ever produced. I suspect the sweet spot will be 4, though a cut throat 5 player game will be fun as well.

RATING: N/A
Not high enough on the family games ranking for us to get in lieu of how many unplayed DoW games that we still have. EX: Cleopatra, Colleseum, Pirate's Cove, Shadows of Camelot. Not to mention ones that don't get played often: TTR, SmallWorld, Memoir 44. And further, Thebes, Thurn and Taxis, Stone Age etc.

However, the game seems to be light to medium weight, has a nice theme, and makes for a nice family game. It's not DoW's best, but it's a nice game that very easily accessible. 

On the other hand, the components are fantastically stunning as typical DoW games. The components elevate the game to one that is worth getting.

Who said this was a family game? If you don't know what you are doing, you will not win. That is for sure. Planning required. But not to much planning, because the goal is to grab as much points as possible, as soon as possible, because the game is over before you know.

Much better than i expected. I enjoyed my 2 plays, but still not completely sure what to think about it. I don't understand the many bad comments this game gets. Maybe that will come later.

My Secret Santa gift for 2013.  A gloriously produced, feather light kids game from DoW.  Rule book not that brilliant, but once you're into the game its quite a lot of fun, even if its generally relaxed pace, brief run-time and overall lack of urgency mean its not ever going to be more than fun for all the family.  Less fiddly and a bit less complex than Tobago, my 7 and 10 year old rated it a 9/10, which is probably good enough to merit keeping on the shelf for a while.

RATING: 8.3
After only one play of this fantastically produced game, I am convinced that it will be getting a lot of table time.
The game looks like a simple move-around-the-board style game, but it soon turns into a rather clever route optimisation game where you need to make sure you are well placed to collect the next relic when it becomes available. As soon as the relics start appearing the game turns into a tense rush to collect them before the game ends.
I'm looking forward to future games!

After my second play: this game is turning into a really great game that builds towards the race for relics.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, streamlined game that rewards forward thinking and demands players manage several mini investments in the form of paths and ivory temple upgrades. If players aren't strategic and thoughtful in their excavations, victory can accidentally be handed to an opportunistic player.

Days of wonder really makes me wonder....

What the hell happened? 

Sure its beautiful, the "relics" are superb, but...while ticket to ride is fun for all ages and even veterans of board gaming can enjoy it, this...it's rather dull and I'd rather go play ticket to ride then this and I am really really fed up with it.

RATING: 5
Entertaining race game where you run along paths, trying to beat the other players to temples and relics. The first part is about optimizing your path (which I think Istanbul does better) while the second part is about using your road network to run between the relics (which I think may cause a chicken race - who will reveal a relic so that the players next in turn may run and grab it). Potential risk for analysis paralysis when evaluating the literally many paths.

There is absolutely nothing here that's even remotely new or different or exciting, to say the least. It feels like a resurrected Bus (game from 1999), this time in family game's clothing instead of a worker placement but still with all the obsoleteness of the network building mechanic just like its granddaddy. The attempt at the theme is simply laughable.

I'm shocked that this was the best possible game Days of Wonder could publish this year.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

The components are great, Days of Wonder style. But the price is consequently high.

It's not the gateway game that it seems, but also doesn't seem to be crunchy enough for gamers. This might cause the game not to see enough table (a problem, given its price).

Also, there's the uncertainty of the other players action, they can effectibly ruin your long term strategy, even unadvertingly.

[b]Relic Runners[/b] was traded away in a math trade 2/7/15. (Received Saint Malo)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Why did I get rid of a game I still rank an 8? Mostly because it was a game I got to play with my family and my kids enjoyed it at first, but then it languished on our shelves. I tried to bring it out at my game group, but there was never any interest. Since I am committed to fitting my collection on a certain shelving unit it got traded to make room for some new games.

I still think this is an underrated DoW game and is great for families, and one I'd still play. However; be warned that while it is relatively light it is not a good gateway game. In the end I think that has a lot to do with Relic Runners lack of success. There newest game, Five Tribes, has enough depth to appeal to gamers while families can enjoy it as well.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Awesome family game that has some hidden depth to be uncovered; I am looking forward to some more plays.
- Excellent production, love how you build the temples out of different shaped cardboard tokens and the relics are really nice (they remind me of Forbidden Island).
- Great intro into route building (it is simple, but you need to put some thought and planning into where your routes are going to connect).
- It is satisfying when you finally get to go on a relic run after spending lots of time exploring temples and building pathways.
- Variable powers can be obtained by exploring certain temples (there are 3 colors of temples and they each give you different abilities or points).[/i]

It's pleasant enough to play, turns are fast, but it doesn't have quite enough substance to encourage a whole lot of replay. Move out from base camp in the middle of the board and each turn decide whether to raid a temple for a special power (or VPs), or build another piece of your movement network. Building your network seems nearly always better because the big points at the end are all about racing from one depleted shrine across as many trails as possible to another depleted shrine in the same colour before anyone else does it. While the bonus VPs and powers along the way are nice, it doesn't quite feel like they compensate, so it seems everyone's going to play much the same way, and then the end game devolves to planning what shrines can I deplete to generate two depletions in the same colour as far apart as possible that I can reach in one turn across my network and then race between them before other players can ... and can I do that more frequently than other players before they the shrines run out and the game ends. Meaning it's a race game of sorts, but a race game in building efficient score-able networks. Which ain't everyone's cup of tea. I didn't mind it because my mind works that way, and as I said, the game went along fast enough but still with just enough to think about each turn to keep you engaged without being overwhelming. But if it's going to play much the same each game, and there's little element of climactic surprise or drama, I'm not sure it's a game I need to own.

Based on one play: In line with other games from Days of Wonder, this is a family friendly game with light rules, but that may also interest more vetted gamers. Simple rules allow all to play, but when playing with other gamers the game adapts well and you can see there is more strategy there. Worth a try and may be a nice addition for more casual gamers.

RATING: 6
This is a light network-building game where you're trying to connect vertices that will grant you immediate benefits, as well as connect certain pairs of vertices (through as long as a route as you can) to claim relics for major points.  There's a lot of relic-sniping that's a little like the goods sniping in Age of Steam, but it felt much worse in this game (especially since there's only one relic per vertex).  Really, it felt too mean for what's supposed to be a light family game.

Beautiful components, as is to be expected of Days of Wonder.  The game is no slouch either.

The interaction between players is competitive without necessarily being cutthroat.  I really enjoy this game.

[1 play] A better game than I expectedly, not sure why I doubted a Days of Wonder title, they usually don’t publish anything but solid games.

In particular, none of us took advantage of the development toolbox tracks nearly as much as I think we might in future playings.

#96 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

You know this is a Days of Wonder game because the components are gorgeous. I especially love the blue bird relics. This game gets more complicated as you go along. At first, you are laying down your framework to be able to traverse the paths on the game board. Later on, you'll be using these paths to try and collect relics. I think this game often gets overlooked, even on my game shelf, but I've enjoyed the experience it provides and should really get it to the table more often.

Attractive production albeit bordering on over-produced (the plastic relic sculpts weren't really necessary).  The game has a nice puzzle element to it and timing has a lot to do with being successful. Player turns are generally quick, so the game moves a long at a good pace.  Overall, the game is a bit stressful at times, but fun, but I honestly don't think it's worth the price.  I'd recommend trying the game before making the investment.

A really cool game of network-building, pick-up-and-deliver and set collection.

Probably one of my favorites from Days of Wonder!

No 10s?  This game is a superb family game!  And thank goodness, it's not about frickin' trains again.  Apparently, the BGG heavies have stricken again.  No 10s???  The heavy gamers apparently rule this site with their, "Well, there's just not enough routes to victory!" or "A little fiddly to set up" or "Hmmph, there is a bit too much LUCK in this game."  Look at the bits, the theme, the smooth flow, the swift point-build at the end.  My heart was pounding.

Everything was very thematic and I deeply enjoyed grabbing those colorful relics.  End game was clear.  Point tallying was clear.  Going back to camp was even purely thematic.  I even enjoyed the slightly fiddly setup because I know it will offer me that many more variables in play in the future.

  It's certainly not as simplistic or, for that matter, as streamlined as Ticket to Ride, but it's actually more fun to play and has a lot more room to grow in future games.  

The feeling of playing it was like pulling back a rubber band.  At first it was slow, but certainly not tedious, and the turns are so short.

Then, the game begins to get more and more tense and all of the energy you put in at the beginning comes back at your opponent.  Freakin' brilliant! 

Suddenly, it's over and your counting secret points.  
Best game of 2014!

From the chunky player mats to the candy-colored treasures, everything in Relic Runners feels like a Fisher-Price product:  "My First Route-Builder."  The publisher must be reaching out to families who have not gamed before, but how they will obtain this game is hard to foresee.  Relic Runners is indeed beautiful.  Experienced players will see the giant destination tiles and paucity of route choices and identify Relic Runners as too simple, even as a gateway game.

This game was a real surprise.

I kept seeing it referred to as a simple family game so I was expecting to use it to introduce non-gamers to the hobby. It turns out the game isn't all that simple and I won't be playing it with non-gamers, but it's pretty fun for gamers. There's some luck in exploring the temples that give points and abilities, but the game is pretty strategic and you have to really plan your moves.

However, it's pretty abstract and mechanical, and something about it just isn't very "fun." If I want a light family game, there are better choices. If I want a heavier strategy game, there are better choices.

RATING: 6
With two players, this game is quite fun. The temples each have only two layers and this meant the game proceeded along much rapidly and one can plan out the moves better. However, I could easily see that with 4 or more players, this game could quickly get frustrating since denial of choice or action could easily happen and relics can be stolen outright prior to your run. 

While this game is called relic runners, it is also clear that establishing a long path and getting the compass scoring toolbox on the highest level to score 2 points each time is quite a powerful and potentially dominant strategy. Players need to know that getting different relics only scores 5 points and hence is not the most powerful move to make if the opportunity does not present itself. 

I would say that this game is best played with 2-3 players though I could be wrong. Still, this is game is decently fun and brain burning with only 2 players.

Very very nice bits, but the board was surprisingly sort of meh in comparison. Not a BAD board, just in comparison to the rest of the parts, it was oddly bland. Gameplay was fine.  Not super-engaging, but fine.

One doesn't usually think "deeper strategy game" when one thinks of Days of Wonder, which is why I didn't put much thought into Relic Runners.  I was surprised with what I found in the game, though, since it does require a good bit of forethought and planning to make a good network in the game.  I'm not sure if the randomized, unknown temples will wind up being frustrating in the long run, but I'm interested in playing this again to see how it holds up.  I do have to say, though, that for a Days of Wonder game, the board is about as visually compelling as a piece of toast.

Light strategy game of jungle exploration. Overproduced like most DoW games.

This is the board game version of the parable about the dog with a bone who sees another dog with a bigger bone. Plenty of running around a map just getting more and more frustrated.

Another solid family hit from DoW as a light to medium weight Euro with fantastic components and plenty of way to get points.  Oh yeah, also packed with fun.

A goober filled game that is not nearly as light as it looks.  This might be a problem as it looks like, but really isn't, a gateway game.

Really not thrilled by this one.
It's more a game of chicken than anything else: "Can you hold out on creating the second blue shrine longer than *I* can? Because as soon as you do, I'll steal it from you!"

Nowadays DOW produces one game a year. I'm stunned that this was the best they could find for 2013.

Days of Wonder games are always beautifully produced and easy to teach and learn, but they're not always great games, sadly. Relic Runners is good, but it's not great. I like how the different temples offer different advantages and how you build your routes and become more efficient in them, but the game just didn't do much for me and I'm unsure why. I'd like to play it again, but I'll end up either trading for it or just playing someone else's copy.

Point to point movement game where we solve a trail puzzle to grab matching relics.  Timing and movement is a little hard to grasp at first. Improve player powers along the path. It is a family game with beautiful art work. Part of the fun is trying to plan and execute big moves. I'm not sure if it would get a lot of repeat play in our home.

Quite enjoyed my play of this at Essen 2013, though the design of the pieces, board etc served to mask the clever play design rather than enhance it.

Like: Artwork. Awesome components. Supply powers. Point systems. Different temple powers.

Dislike: Getting the actual relics out of a temple seems like a thematic disconnect.

Beautiful as always DOW, components are off the charts, the theme is richly implemented, the mechanics are rather solid. There is quite a bit of take that with players taking the exact turn you wanted to take right before you can. Make no mistake, this is straight route building, but polished to a shine in typical DOW fashion.

This game is exactly what Days of Wonder, its publisher, does best. It was a good amount of depth, and never bogs down. The artwork is excellent. The production quality is amazing. With a game length of just above an hour, and complexity just above "family game", this is precisely my favorite kind of game.

+ It's a Feld game; There could be some depth here, trying to hide your true loyalties while still advancing your goals.
- I would guess that this game will only work well with the maximum player count; With 3 players, it was pretty easy to figure out who was who.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's monetary value far exceeded its play value.  
I sent this out as a big part of a trade for 2 core sets of Star Wars Armada.

Nagyon ötletes (Feld esetében ez nem meglepetés) és izgalmas játék, a híres Umberto Eco regény adta helyszínen, és az ott megismert szereplőkkel. A játékosok végig azt próbálják kitalálni, hogy a többiek melyik bábuval vannak, az alapján, hogy ki melyik bábút mozgatja előnyös vagy hátrányos helyzetbe. A játék egyetlen szépséghibája, hogy annak ellenére lettem utolsó, hogy engem senki sem leplezett le, én meg 3-ból 2 ellenfelet eltaláltam. De sebaj, ennek ellenére is nagyon jó!!:) Az óra megoldása külön tetszik, de egyébként is csupa eredeti mechanizmust tartalmaz. Könnyed kategória. Akinek a Mr. Jack tetszik, annak ez is fog:) És még valami: jó a hangulata, eléggé átjön a téma.

I am a bit unconvinced at the moment... just as in heimlisch i feel it's hard to do better than you'd do not checking which character you are assigned. and the game seemed too long to make me want to try some bolder strategies.

Of course it reminds at Heimlich & Co, but it isn't half as good. Heimlich & Co is short, easy and fun. But this game is far too long, too much of the same kind and after two rounds no fun at all, just waiting for the end. Oh... I won, but I prefer to loose in a good game.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
This one has some neat deduction elements (The only came with deduction from Feld?), but its probably a turn or 2 to long.  While the mechanism to stall the game is in place for a reason, it really does seem to slow the game down a bit too much.  Overall I did enjoy this one, and thought it was neat, but probably not something I need to own.  Would willingly play again for sure however.

RATING: 5
Ez a játék abszolút arra alapoz, hogy egy óra után mennyit tudsz megjegyezni a sok lépésből és ebből mit szűrsz le. Azt ki kell mondjam, hogy szórakoztató, de  csak annak ajánlom, aki a száraz logikai játékoktól el tud rugaszkodni. Sokat számít a kommunikáció és nem csak beszédben, hanem póker szinten is. Egy-egy mozdulat sokat elárul a másikról. Kifejezetten tetszik az idő telésének a megoldása. A nyerési esély nem a zsenialitáson múlik.

RATING: 6
This game is alright. It needs 4-5 players. The game plays well, although it often becomes pretty obvious who is who. A typical case for a pasted on theme, as it does not have to do very much with the book/film, except setting and characters. Frustrating: You do not find the real killer! Final verdict: Nice family game for rainy Sunday afternoons.

A reworking of Wolfgang Kramer's Heimlich & Co.

Another good game from Stefan Feld after last year's In the Year of the Dragon.

A good deductive game. Not sure how much control there is, but it's fun to guess at who's who.

Really enjoyed this at Essen 2008. Look forward to replay.

The one aspect that is scripted and wonky, is that no one wants to end the round and get whacked with +2 clue points, so the round drags on.

Update in July 2017. Dropped to 6. These secret colour ID games have fallen a bit flat for me. Often, one player's colour is trashed randomly and there is nothing much you can do about it.

RATING: 7
This is another clever game in the Kosmos solid "literary tie-in line". An interesting take in that it isn't a deduction game a la Mystery at the Abbey, but more of a tactical and guessing game. Reminiscent of Heimlich & Co/Top Secret Spies, but more textured & nuanced and so more interesting for adults. The tensions are nicely balanced: you want your Monk to be innocent (least evidence against him at at the end), but whether or not the other players can identify who you are by your actions is a fairly substantial part of the endgame scoring. So you really do have to be careful.

It's in the same niche as Journey to the Center of the Earth, Around the World in 80 Days, The Golden Compass, etc., in that it's in a nice spot for casual gamers but, unlike Pillars of the Earth, is probably not compelling enough for the serious hobbyist. For me, this is a game that I would probably buy in a US edition, but importing it is too expensive.

Based on 1 play with 2 players: Okay first off, this game isn't really meant for two players. That said, I see definite potential here. It's fun and filled with bluff and double guessing. The luck factor is kind of high, but I think it balances it pretty nicely... it seems like a skilled player will still be able to make good use of almost any card. Like Inkognito or Mr. Jack, Name of the Rose is all about using your movements wisely to avoid suspicion and trying to deduce who is who by how people move and react to your movements. Definitely look forward to trying it with more players.

I play this with a variant allowing 4 rounds, the full 6 drags on to long in my opinion. The deduction aspect is entertaining trying to uncover logic ebbing a players move. The game is kind of repetitive and doesn't have a whole lot of variety, so I wouldn't play it as much, but it's nice to play as a change of pace.

One play with a full compliment of five. An interesting take on the sleuth story in which you try not to solve a murder case (as is the case with [i]Mystery of the Abbey[/i]) but rather to end up as the monk the least suspected by your fellow players. This is achieved by giving each player a secret identity [i]Clans[/i]-style, and then playing all monks, including your own. As the game progresses, you must reveal little tidbits of information telling the others what monk you are not, and at the end there is of course the Big Revelation in which everyone discloses their secret identity.

The core idea works much better than MotA, but unfortunately the game itself is too bland and repetitive for it to last as long as it does. Basically you are moving monks about and they either become more or less suspect, and then at given times the suspicion is 'transformed' into evidence. To prevent your monk from being recognised by everyone you'll have to do some counter-intuitive stuff too, and that more or less makes the game a little interesting. But it still doesn't justify the long playing time. [i]Clans[/i] is in all ways the superior title here. Granted, it's nice to have a Rose-game which actually works—it's just that there is nothing special about it which would keep on drawing me back. I think a 4 is too much already.

[b]Update[/b] Yup, playing time is really way over the top on this one. And the events are just annoying. Careful strategies to hide one's identity can be derailed through a careless card being turned over.

A clever bluff and deduction game and a much better use of the Murder in the monastery theme than Mystery in the Abbey. 

Moves along at a reasonable rate once everyone has played before but on first play can appear to play a little too long for what it is - but give it a chance. Like many games the strategy starts to come through once you are not having to concentrate on the rules and I think this game is particularly vulnerable on this score due to the nuances involved in the bluffing and deduction - i.e. on first play did player A do that because of X or did he just not know what's happening as he hasn't grok'd the game yet.

Cards, board and artwork are top-notch quality, except  the tokens which are a bit thin and meh.

Worth a play or two.....or three.

Players are investigating monks of dubious character at a monastery.  Players take turns playing a card that moves a monk to another location in the monastery.  That monk either has business there (good behavior) or not (suspicious behavior).  The character of each monk is tracked on the suspicion track (no hard evidence) or clue track (damned dodgy monk).  The object of the game is to keep your hidden identity secret and coming last on the clue track when the game ends.  Fun game, and I really enjoyed the deduction element as you watch what the other players are doing, to determine their identity.  Seems geared towards tight finishes, so I suspect winning may come down to a large luck element.  It also felt a little bit long.  Still, a good design and well implemented.

After several plays the game is a 6 for me.  A bit too slow (a bit boring slow not a slow building tension slow), and It ALWAYS comes down to the final guess and day chips you own.  It's as though the entire game is meaningless except to study the other players.  I like the studying of players aspect, but that's it.  All strategies don't really matter excepting hiding.

I've wanted to play this for a while and wasn't disappointed. A clever game of deduction where you are trying to keep your suspicion score down but without the other players guessing your identity while you are try and guess there identity. 

The game is played over 6 days with the monks gaining more suspicion points the higher up they finish on the clue track each day. Each day also has a different event that - can affect how the monks, clues and suspision are manipulated. 

It is probably a pretty good game to play with non-gamers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Despite being a Stefan Feld game, it's actually quite good. You try to keep your secret monk identity a secret whilst trying to protect him from Suspicion or worse Clues! This is quite hard, as to do so make sit more obvious which colour you are, and at the end the other players identify you and you suffer more Clues points for the correct guesses. Player with the lowest Clues total at the end is the winner.

The actions in the game are very very simple, which one player found boring as too repetitive. I struggled for lack of the right cards, but the way the game worked as a whole was very good and entertaining. The events cards added some interest, and the revelations was clever and added more subtext. It's an interesting variant on the secret ID type game, such as Heimlich & Co.

Amazingly, the editors at Ravensburger were able to stop Feld shoving more and more and more mechanisms in, so it remains a very clean, open design. Well worth playing and if you find a copy, grab one.

A more elaborate version of the classic SdJ winner Heimlich & Co. where players try to improve their position without giving away their identity.

It can run a bit long but at least it's for a reason: You need a somewhat solid foundation to base your final guess of who is who on at the end of the game. Different events each day help shake things up a little and not get too repetitive.

I was surprised at the fun I had trying this one out.  It's not a horrible brain burner, and even though our first play of a GERMAN copy it went pretty smoothly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Contrary to what the theme implies, this is not a deduction game. It is a very random and chaotic game where you don't try to find out the murderer, but to be the least suspicious monk instead (having the least points). It's really not very thematic, including a weird mechanic that makes it possible to stop the clock for several turns.

You are supposed to hide your identity, but at certain points, you have to reveal a color that is not yours. Depending on the players' choices, you may be easily or even unequivocally discovered by no fault of your own. And if you give yourself away and manage to stay behind in the clue track (winning), the other players will just target you, because points are open and it is very easy to harm specific monks. For that reason also, it is unlikely that a player gets much behind in the clue track, even if his identity is unknown, and the scores tend to be close until the endgame. That causes the whole game to feel pointless, except for the exercise in guessing the colors of the other players.

It may work very well as a gateway game for non-gamers, but after five plays with varied numbers of players, unsuccessfully trying to find anything of worth for me, I see no reason to play it again.

TJA!?! Ok design. Et spill hvor man prøver å bløffe - alle er mistenkelig akkurat som i filmen. Kan kanskje være ok hvis man nylig har sett filmen "In the Name of the Rose". Et spill som virkelig trenger mer enn 2 spillere for at det skal fungere godt. Blir litt for lett med bare 2 spillere.

Was originally reluctant to play this game as I typically don't enjoy deduction games.  However, to my surprise I really enjoy this game.  Great game with max number of players but recently played as a three player and it really looses a great deal.

I have played a few secret identity games and I enjoy them though most are pretty light fare, which is fine if they are fun and gametime reflects it, not always the case. 

This is by far the biggest knock on this game, too long. This might be because we had a rule wrong, we're not sure at this point. What was happenening was that everyone was able to avoid ending a day (and taking a penalty) by playing some chits from their hand, this caused the days to last too long. It all worked fine but it extended the length. In this case it is easily tweakable with zero ill effects, remove a day or two and play as normal as games like this need to run under an hour for sure and ours did not.

Gameplay is similiar to other games in the genre, try to help your monk but do not give away your identity in the process. This really comes out as a nice updating of Heimlich as there were some nice twists included here and it all came together in a clever package that actually gave you some more things to think about with small decisions to make which kept it interesting. 

Clever inclusions included cardplay causing a 24 hour clock to advance, movements by monks not in a certain favourable domain causes them to gain suspicion points, other ways to also add or subtract suspicion points to any given monk by using special powers utilizing William or Adso, end of a day these suspicion points are transferred to a VP track.

At the end of the game you try to guess who each player is, of course there is at least 1 character that no one is and it should become apparent but it may not. You get some final points subtracted for every person that guess you correctly and then scores are added up. I kind of thought there should of been a small reward for every person you guessed right but that was just my little thought and I see now after playing Heimlich that it is a big part of the scoring there. I have fun with these deduction games just by accusing the other players on who's who and this one was no exception. 

Needs further play to see if the clock issue is an issue or a wrong rule, it works fine and adds to the game but it also added too much time in our game, if it is correct then subtracting a year or two will be needed to keep the game under an hour (30 - 40 minutes is really the optimal time for this)

The Heimlich & Co. feeling but with a nicer mecanic.
It may give the sensation that it takes too long, but only if you really are not in the game.
Forget the idea of trying to control your monk, if you think that is the way it should be, then this game isn't for you.

RATING: 6.5
Similar to Heimlich & Co., this is a game of hidden identities, and adding points to mystery players.  However, here, points are "bad" and this really helps the game along.  After all, there are five other colors to smack down, so it is not so obvious which color you're playing for.  Additionally, there are reasons you might want to hurt your own color a little, further making your moves less obvious and giving you some strategic issues to play with.  It also fits the mystery theme well.

Not having read the book, there is little draw in the theme of the game, which seems adequate.  I was hoping for more from Stefan Feld, but the game seems fairly random.  I don't have a problem with randomness, especially since I realize that this game is targeted mainly toward family gamers, but the length makes the randomness a bigger problem.  I suppose with the right group you may be able to get a good grasp of what your opponents are doing, but having so many options on your turn (being able to move monks anywhere, or to move any monk to a particular building) allows skillful players to mask their identity.  By the end, narrowing it down to only 3 possibilities helps, but I found that the game play is not convincing enough to warrant too many more plays.

Sold February 2015. It's amazing how in demand this game is. Most of my GeekMail messages were requests for this game. It was sold less than an hour after I listed it.

RATING: 8
Very fun deduction/hidden roles game. The mechanics are simple enough that you can focus on the sneaky parts of the game (i.e. implicating other monks and saving your own). There is some room for clever play as well as deduction, but the game is mainly about throwing suspicion around and trying to save your own monk.

[comment after 1 play]

This is a hidden identities game where you are trying to cast suspicions on other players, while trying to be the least suspected for your color. In some ways it is reminiscent of Clans.

I had fun, and I think it is a good game, but the game does go a little bit too long (I think it took about 100 minutes). The game should really be under an hour. There is a variant where you play only four days (instead of 6), I think I'll suggest this variant next time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are some nice ideas, but in the end this just becomes a little tedious game repeating itself. Players are just playing their bigger numbers early on each day and the luck of the draw plays quite a part as the brown monk cards seem to be advantageous at the end of any day. Also, you can lose by sheer bad luck during a single round if your color is simply beaten too badly even when there's no clear consensus that it's someone's color.

This game felt overcomplicated for what it offered and left me longing for the simple elegance of [i]Heimlich & Co.[/i]  So far as I could tell, it seemed as if the only way to win this game was by attacking the other colors.

RATING: 5
Deduction game of trying to figure out which color monk belongs to who. You can make other monks, your own monk look more suspicious or less suspicious. Try to earn victory by being the least suspicious. Gameplay seemed really random. Most of the game it seems quite difficult to figure out who is who and just comes down to blindly guessing.

Bought from Essen 2008. Nothing unique or special here. Works well, although the end of day "slow-down-game" is a bit annoying. I mean, there is this 2 points penalty for the player, who ends the day, so everybody wants to slow down the time. Hidden characters gives nice twist to the game, but I would hope that there were some more deduction elements included...

My first game went longer than I cared, but it was still quite interesting and enjoyable.  Much like Heimlich & Co., you are trying to discern which color monk your opponents are while trying to deceive everyone else about your identity.  Special action cards at the start of each day (6 in total) throw wrenches into the normal play but effect everyone equally.  A couple special monks also effect other monks where they are together on either the clue or suspicion track (you want to be as close to 0 on both tracks as you can!).  This proved to be a surprise to me as I didn't really expect to like it that much.  This is likely one of my favorite deduction games, but it does go on a bit too long at times.  

SOLD as the game tends to go a bit too long to maintain interest.

Really surprise by this one.  I shouldn't have been.  I'm a big Stefan Feld fan but I hadn't heard much about this game and a friend got it for a song on the bargain rack at the local game store.  May take some further plays but my first impression is pretty good.

I won my first game and I'm sure that helps my opinion.  There is some luck involved in what cards one draws and which colors everyone chooses to reveal throughout the game.  My color was red but everyone else revealed blue while I still had not so I was able to pretend I was blue and throw them off my scent.  On the other hand, I guessed correctly on every other monk at the end of the game so perhaps it was some good play that won the game after all.  In any case, it was fun, a bit of a brain-burner but not in the usual sense.  And very unlike anything else I've played, even by Feld.  Another winner, in my opinion, and I think a fairly underappreciated one at that.

UPDATE: played twice more.  I won once with a similar strategy to last time, able to pick out the other players and stay hidden myself.  The second game I did not hid my character well enough, while another player did and he won, so I definitely think it comes down to that, although you can't let it get away from you too early either.  Anyway, I've enjoyed it each time I play it.  We seem to love the theme a lot to and play up the suspiciousness.  Glad I own this one.  Different than anything else I have.

I like both Eco and Feld and this clever deduction game seems to deserve a much higher rating. A bit similar to Clans, you play a hidden color (a monk) which you try to favor without revealing yourself. You do this primarily by throwing suspicions on other monks while at the same time deducing which of them that belong to other players. Among the extra mechanisms that add flavor to The Name of the Rose are the possibility to stop the time (since the player finishing a round scores negatively) and the gradual revelation of the colors you don't play. However, I wonder if this is necessary as similar games like Avalon manage with less mechanisms and shorter playing time. I suspect that The Name of the Rose needs the right playing group to shine.

Update: Sold because Clans does the secret colors better while Avalon has a more social deduction.

This is a very tense, bluff-heavy game with a deduction element that is less pronounced than you'd probably think.  It plays NOTHING like Mystery of the Abbey, the game to which it will inevitably be compared, except that in both games, one inattentive/apathetic player can easily ruin everyone's fun.

The big problem with this game is the hoarding of time tiles for the inevitable clock-stopping during the 23rd hour, with everyone desperate to avoid taking an event tile and the penalty that goes with it.  It screams to be houseruled away.

better than the usual deduction game. every player gets a secret color. cards drive placement of colored pawns/monks, that manipulate the order of color markers on a 'day' track. depending on the position of the marker on the day track at the end of the day/round, the colors are drawn forward on the suspicion track (negative victory point track)

My expectations were not high - and I knew what kind of game to expect. So, in the end, the game wasn't really disappointing. It rather met my (low) expectations. 
I'm neither a fan of Heimlich & Co nor do I like deduction games very much in general. 
Also I dislike games in which people decide upon the faith of others without even knowing who they destroy, who they favour. 
Finally, it takes way too long for what it is. The whole group was relieved after the end. ("Oh, another 2 rounds to play ...")

Wohooo! Arrived today 27th January 2012. A nice trade from the Euro Maths trade! YAY! High hope on this one being a big fan of the Book! :)

Very fun game. Rating after 1 play only and might improve. There are many different things that might warrant a specific move, which helps the players dissimulate their true agendas. The events further help sneaky behaviour. This seems like a keeper and I'm very eager to play a few more times in order to be able to fully appreciate the mechanic. So far though, very nice!

- Rules are very well written, there are a a few things to keep track of at first but it's easy to refer to the rule book. Once you played one full day there shouldn't be many doubts left. A bit more difficult to explain than might be expected at first. Have a test-round simulating different things and the game will be quickly understood.

Non vado pazzo, sia per gusti personali che per questioni genetiche, per le meccaniche con un retrogusto astratto e con un grande uso del colore: The Name of the Rose è un'eccezione. Nel genere dei giochi deduttivi è l'uovo di Colombo: lo scopo del gioco non è trovare il colpevole, ma essere il meno sospettato tra i possibili indiziati. L'ambientazione - ben resa anche graficamente - è affascinante e il gioco, riprendendo alla lontanissima Mr. Jack, offre un meccanismo di deduzione più raffinato: le identità dei giocatori sono segrete, e nella plancia di gioco tutti muovono i segnalini di tutti. Questo fa sì che l'aspetto "umano" sia un'arma in più: sposti il bianco perché lo sei e vuoi far punti o vuoi solo farci credere di essere il bianco? Il "far credere di essere qualcun altro" è ulteriormente premiato al termine del gioco, quando ognuno prova a fare le associazioni segnalino/giocatore. Un bel gioco: Cluedo è lontano anni luce.

Nem jutok szóhoz! A regényt olvasva, a filmet látva, Feld játékait kedvelve eldöntöttem, hogy idővel beszerzem. Tudom csekély mennyiség kering belőle itthon, így nem volt egyszerű, de sikerült.
Iszonyatosan izgalmas, még ketten is, bár szerintem 4-5 fővel jöhet ki - tán még jobban - a játék ereje. Maga a mechanikája pofonegyszerű és nem is attól izgalmas, hanem attól, hogy próbálja az ember elterelni magáról a figyelmet, akár a táblán, akár verbálisan a táblán kívül. Izgalmas minden perce. Bár lehetséges, hogy két fővel kiismerhetővé válik majd a játék és a taktika, de ezt majd meglátjuk.

Diving in the bargain bin almost never works. But if I got results like The Name of the Rose more often, it would be hard to resist. I scored this one for a mere $11, and it ended up being much better than that price indicated. 

It's a neat deduction game where each player is secretly one of the six colored monks. Through the play of action cards, you try to place suspicion on other monks while making your monk look less shifty. But you can't be too obvious, because other players will have to guess who you are at the end, and you look much shiftier if they get it right. It's a cool twist on deduction. This game deserved better than it got.

*edit*Impressed me after one game, but faded fast after that. It's awfully repetitive, and I think it's a little too unforgiving to people who have had bad luck. I can deal with that in DungeonQuest, but this ain't no DungeonQuest.

Have to play it yet. At first glance I must say the theme is a bit weird - monks get evidence (and eventually blame) stacked against them, based on where they move and who they happen to meet. Thematically that seems a bit arbitrary and not very much in the spirit of the book. However I still to hope for it to hit my gaming table soon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
There is a murder in the abbey, but who is it?  In The Name of the Rose each player is assigned a secret identity and have the task of being the monk with the fewest clues against him.  The game is divided into 6 days, and each day has an event which alters the rules of the game in some way.  Players have a hand of 3 cards which allow them to move monks to buildings.  Each card played will advance the clock a set number of hours.  On each building are Task Tiles, each tile bearing a number and a color.  When a monk is moved into a building he will either gain suspicion points or lose them (he either does not belong in the building or has a legitimate reason for being there).  At the end of the day clues are awarded to the monks based on their suspicion tokens.  At the end of the game players secretly guess the identity of the other players; each correct guess adds clues to that player's monk.

Each turn players must decide what monk they will affect and in what way.  Often the player has the ability to help their own monk, but to do so may give away their secret identity which usually spells disaster.  There is an added tension with the suspicion points, task tiles are gained by players if they reduce suspicion points, and those task tiles can be used to decrease the number of hours it takes to complete an action; this is handy because ending the day will gain a player clue points at the end of the day.  So players are always deciding if they need task tiles, and if they do which color they will help, weighed against the ability to hurt other players and risk ending the day later.

A játék egyszerűségében van valami amit mindenkit megfog. Jelen esetben nem a gyilkost kell megtalálni (aki olvasta vagy látta a név alapjául szolgáló könyvet az tudja, hogy miről is szól a történet, aki nem annak röviden annyit, hogy egy középkori apátságban gyilkosság történik és megjelenik két szerzetes, hogy kivizsgálja az esetet), hanem minden játékos egy ott élő szerzetest alakítva próbálja magát a legártatlanabbnak beállítani, tehát jelen esetben teljesen érdektelen, hogy ki az igazi gyilkos mert ez nem számít. A játék végig izgalmas és intrikáktól sem mentes. Nagyon tetszett.

Not a lot of substance to the game. Simply trying to deduce who is which colour seems to be the main objective.

RATING: 4.5
My first ever Euro game. Despite the serious looking theme and components, it's really a light-medium 45-min filler. This game really appeals to people who enjoy  bluffing and deduction - my game group does. Even people who can't keep a straight face during a game of Werewolf should find it easier to bluff during this game. 

However, this game lacks tension and can feel repetitive, especially when playing the full 7 days. The problem lies in groupthink - players can be trapped into the mentality of hoarding time tiles and stretching the day forever (unless the right Event card is in play). This effect is reduced when playing with 4 and 5P, so this game is strictly best played with that number.

I only played it with two players and it just was a little to easy and repetetive. I guess it's much better with more players.

Awesome game. This was totally different than what I thought. I was anticipating a traditional deduction game(Sleuth,Mystery at the Abbey) but instead I found a clever game with mechanics which I found pretty coherent with the theme.

RATING: 6.5
After hearing a few comments about it, I was expecting it to be a lot worse. Maybe having low expectations helped? Or maybe it's just a pretty good game? I suspect it would play a bit better with more players -- with 3, you'd expect a few colors to quickly become the obvious ones that no one was playing (similar problem as in 3-player Container, I think). It didn't work out that way in our game, of course, but still....

A relatively quick game of deduction that, like Shadows Over Camelot, has a lot of talk about suspicious activity and possible player roles. I'd definitely like to try it again. I wonder, though, if the penalty at the end (for players correctly deducing your monk's color) may be a bit too steep? It seemed the game really came down to who guessed/deduced correctly at game's end! More likely, that's just inexperience talking.

--- Summary ---
The board shows several locations, each with 2 numbered (2-6) chits in one of 6 colors (the rest are face down in a line next to the board). There are 6 colored monk pieces, a Williams piece, and an Anson piece, all set up in different locations at the start. All monks start with 10 suspicion points and 5 clue points. Players are each randomly assigned one monk color (keep secret!). Each player receives 3 cards (which show either a monk, a location, or Williams/Anson). 

There are 7 rounds (days), each with 24 hours. Each day starts by revealing a random event tile in effect for that day. Then, players take turns playing cards: monk card = move that monk to a different location; location card = move any piece to that location; Williams/Anson card = move either of those pieces to any other location. Cards also have a number (0-5): add as many hours to the clock, unless you spend previously collected chits to reduce the number (by 1 per chit spent) -- spent chits added to the line of chits next to the board. If you move past 2400 hours, the day ends. Draw a card at the end of your turn.

When a monk is moved to a location, if there is no piece of their color, increase their suspicion by the sum of (both) chits present. If there is, take that chit and reduce the monk's suspicion score by the number on that chit. If it was the last chit, add 2 chits from the line next to the board.

If Williams moves to a location, add/subtract 3 from each of the clue scores for all monks present there. For Anson, it's +/- 5 suspicion points.

When the day ends, that player takes the event tile (=2 clue points against their monk at end of game). Convert suspicion points to clue points by ranking most to least (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 clue points); ties "generous". Reset suspicion points to 10 for all monks.

After days 1, 3, and 5 players reveal one color they are NOT.

Day 7 is different: players simultaneously guess which monk other players were assigned. For every correct guess, that player's monk receives (substantial) additional clue points (number of points varies based on number of players).

The player with the fewest clue points against their monk wins the game!

You really don't have all that much control, especially in the early rounds, and the game is too long.  Make that WAY too long for such a random game.  Unfortunately, the bluff aspect here is minimal, and that's the core of the game.

Although it didn't seem a brilliant game, I think it could be a good introductory game or family game.
I don't like some of the events. Some are stupid or uninteresting. It seems that they were added to the game just to make a more reasonable number.

Like Heimlich & Co., but a bit more contrived. 
Certainly better with more. With two, it's a bit too tame and there's less opportunity to fool your fellow player. Probably more suited for families than for gamers, as they're likely to drag the game by hoarding chores tiles.

Oddly similar to Clans. You secretly are trying to make one of the rainbow of monks the least suspicious. To do this you need to divert suspicion to other monks, while not revealing your own monk's color.

Umberto Eco strikes again with another monk-themed mystery game, this time on a thinly-lacquered abstract.  The Name of the Rose has so much board activity that it is easy to slip into multiplayer solitaire and forget the bluffing, but the remaining game is entertaining enough.

Looks good, is fun to play... in a way... but as with some books, the end ruuined it for me. The whole time playing the gameyou work towards a goal but in the end it's never reaching the point at which you feel a rewarding victory of some sorts. It's more like "okay, you got me. What are we playing next?"

I didn't enjoy my first game, but to be fair I lost pretty badly. To me it felt like deduction didn't seem to mean much, and instead it was much more important to simply not wind up ending the day, which was all up to the draw of the deck. (if you are the one to end the day the player to your left has more chances to unload high value cards before the rush of playing low value cards starts, meaning they get more turns to gather tokens and more turns to save up low cards.)

Buen juego familiar, que quizás necesita de un par de partidas con el mismo grupo de jugadores para empezarle a sacar todo su jugo. Sus virtudes son un final realmente emocionante y unos componentes muy bonitos. Sus defectos son los colores de los monjes que se confunden y que quizás es demasiado largo. [Actualización abril 2009: lo que no termina de funcionar en este juego es que puedes jugar sin dar una sola pista de cual es tu monje y terminar ganando, es muy fácil despistar al personal perjudicando cada vez a un monje, incluido el propio]

I'd not played 'NoR' before but trying to implicate other monks and getting away with your own misdemeanors is the crux here. Thankfully, it was the two 'neutrals' who were proved the most innocent so a draw was the end result.

I had to have this game, just because of the huge impact the book had on me when I read it. The game itself is very light and, in my opinion, drags on at least a round or two too long. It's also very random and depends a lot on luck of the draw.

The unfortunate death of a monk at the isolated Benedictine Abbey leads to a murder mystery using secret unit deployment, deduction and a whole lot of bluffing. William of Baskerville is asked to prove the innocence of the unjustly accused. We, as monks try to keep away from creating suspicion which may lead to clues that could be used against us.  This sinister game lets the bluff adept run rough shod over the gullible... every time. I love the ancillary mechanic of controlling the passing hours of time during each day during our worker action card play.

This game is ridiculously fun.  I love the book, but the theme is only slightly there.  It doesn't matter to me however because this is a perfect admixture of deduction and bluffing.  There are complaints about playing it 2-player, but there's a very simple fix: just play 12 hours/day instead of 24 and it works perfect!

Just played this with 3-players.  This game just gets better and better.

Then with five.  Spectacular.

I didn't expect this to be so bad as I like Stefan Feld's previous games.

I didn't have control over my monk. If I tried to do something with my monk to help him everyone would guess that it's mine monk. All I could do was just try to guess who is who which was not that easy as everybody played randomly without a plan.

I will try probably one more time (after clearing out one rule) but I don't realy want to play it again :(

--- EDIT --

yup we did played one rule wrong. But still the damage is done. I don't think I want to play it again :(

As you settle in to play this game, you really start to feel the subterfuge and suspicion from the book/film.  The unfortunate part of this game is that you could just wing it in a "don't care" way, and have absolutely no fun playing it.  On the other hand, if you let the theme grab you, it's a fun game of misdirecting suspicion while trying to identify the various players.  Sadly, there's no bonus for correctly identifying the other players, other than increasing the evidence against them.  (Sadly, because in my first game, I correctly identified both of the other players - hee hee hee - good educated guesses, really, but it still was gratifying.)

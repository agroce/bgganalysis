Game seemed to be too random with few choices.  I compare co-ops to Pandemic and Pandemic has more odds calculations to help in making choices.  This one, dice determine where smoke then fire pops up and it just seemed like chasing our tails rather than making strategic choices.

Decent game but others in the same category seem a pinch better.

Pros:
Very thematic. Tension and excitement builds as the fire gets out of control. Fairly simple rules. New gamer/family friendly. Fun!

Cons:
Not a realistic simulation (but then perhaps a more realistic simulation wouldn't be fun). The choices are fairly obvious. The hot points and haz mats are a bit fiddly (I believe the Tragic Events expansion resolves this).

One of the best games I have ever played. You need to get used to the AI in the experienced mode, but once you get it into your blood stream, its a blast !!! 

In comparison to Pandemic, this one is very exciting and it feels dangerous and heroic. Also the feeling when you save a girl from flames is super  Also the deck gun is super fun  

I like this game a lot however only in experienced mode, the family mode is too bland for me.

I'd heard tons of glowing reviews and recommendations before I finally got a copy.  I was really underwhelmed when I finally played it.  Mechanics are cute, but thematically, I found it really odd that people would keep appearing randomly and sometimes even in spaces you just walked through.

Quick setup and reset, a different experience each time, and many different ways to play (family, advanced, solitaire, to six) make this title a huge win here.

I would ALMOST call this a filler, but it's more than that. The visceral feeling of being in a burning building with the requisite urgency is fascinating.

It's an excellent game: highly thematic, accessible, endlessly expandible, and attractive. I am conflicted on the unpredictable difficulty levels: I love the peril of the random dice rolls, but I find the massive swings in difficulty between games frustrating. It's a minor criticism; this is a game for everyone - it encourages teamwork and responsibility; and it's downright fun.

RATING: 4
Flsah Point: Fire Rescue could be used as a synonym for a boring game. Everyone is given a special ability which pretty much nails down what you do in the game. This results in zero decision making during the game, which equals getting bored. Moreover, the ratio between play time and administrative tasks (i.e. rolling dice to determine locations for new outbursts of smoke and flame and points of interest) is way off. Your turn is over in 5 seconds while all the dice rolling between turns takes 20-30 seconds per turn.

Otherwise the game works just fine and there are no apparent flaws in it. It just is not fun, since there is hardly anything to do. Probably the best quality of the game is that the promised 45min playing time seems to be quite close to reality.

Goes on a bit long with more than 4 players.  It's decent but I can think of better co-op games.  It does rinse and repeat a bit and there's maybe a mite too much luck to make it one of the better games in the genre.

Fast, fun, thematic game. I really think the theme and mechanics mesh well.

It compares well to Pandemic, but with a faster pace. I think it captures the fire rescue theme well, as you search for victims and try to keep the blaze under control. The fact that you don't have to spend a lot of time searching for where the fire spreads keeps the game moving briskly.  I can play this in half the time it takes to play a game of Pandemic.

A theme that shines brightly, clean layout and typography that just "flows" and makes sense, well-crafted components, awesome fire mechanic.... what's not to love?! My wife and I instantly fell in love with this on our first play, and I can't wait to get it to the table again. It plays quickly, the rules make sense, and it feels very intimate.

FP:FR gets compared to Pandemic a lot, and rightly so. It shares several aspects and mechanics that work very well. However, while I adore Pandemic and it's expansions, FP:FR has a lot to recommend it as well. This shouldn't be an either/or decision, but rather, get both! Pandemic feels massive, a global fight for survival. FP:FR feels very personal, a rapidly-changing struggle to save victims in a burning house. The difference in scale/scope is notable, and both do their jobs well.

Get Flash Point. If you enjoy co-op gaming at ALL, FP:FR will scratch the itch.

I have only played the family game with my six year old.  I consider it a very good sign after finishing the game that he immediately wanted to play again.  That does make me want to rate it higher, but I'll resist for now.

The game is fun, simple, short and not so easy you will win every time.

Edit: After playing with the whole family, using the alternate map, and adding some rules like a random setup and specialists, I'm boosting my rating to an 8.  This is a great game.  I look forward to what hotspots, hazmats, vehicles, etc adds to the game.

An easy, quick cooperative game with a theme that I think most gamers and non-gamers could get into.  Not the deepest strategy ever, but still interesting and fun.

Was really interested in this one, but our first play was just so-so. Lots of double checking rules to see how the fire spreads during explosions, and just something seemed to be missing for us, but it was at the end of a long game day, so maybe it just caught us at the wrong time. Definitely see the potential for playing with the family once the kids get older tho, and hoping I can increase my rating after playing a little bit more.

It's like a really cool [thing=30549][/thing] with a much stronger theme.  I'm not sure I like it as much as Pandemic, though, as my 2nd game was a big dud that nobody at the table liked.

A promising game that suffers from rules clarification bonanza. A problem that occurs frequently when written by designers that don't bother about prove-reading and others to test play after reading rules by themselves. 

A cooperative game that test your logic against the game system. The game system for fire spread depends on adjacency. So concentrating specific square to clear fire can limit damage and spread. Spending a few turns to clear fire instead of helping victims seem to be a good strategy in game terms. 

Very luck dependent as the dice does all the talking. But strange if fire begins again from a room that is cleared with 'water and engine hose'. Very gamey, similarity to real life situation is moderate at best. Thus the game make you feel that the fire fighters are the only one doing the job while the others sit and watch outside....even if the building collapses. 

Interesting first game....Same downward spiral in the next following game.....did not want to play a third. Average game that will rate badly as you play more.

This makes a change from Pandemic but the dice instead of cards system of crises is both a positive and negative change, as your success or failure is a function of the streaky rolling you definitiely will get.

базовый, семейный вариант игры представляет из себя продвинутый "Запретный остров". там остров тонул, а его можно было осушать, здесь дом горит, и можно тушить. 

на двоих идёт вполне нормально, плюс игра хорошо масштабируется (но вчетвером будет проще, т.к. нужно будет меньше бегать). не так много взаимодействий, думаю, вполне можно взять по два героя. 

My house rules for this game are if the puppy and kitty die, then it is an instant game over :P

после второй партии: хорошая игра, заметно лучше "Запретного острова", но напряжённая атмосфера и кризисный сеттинг приводят к тому, что приходится прикладывать усилие, чтобы достать коробку с полки.

Doesn't hit the table as often as I'd like because most people I play with don't want to have civilians die in fires in their games. They also only used some of the "full" rules and not others, making their previous game significantly harder. Fire truck use is very important to coordinate with other players.

It took me a while to enjoy this one, but once I got the hang of the rules (somehow, they didn't seem intuitive to me at first), I got into it. The fire advance mechanism is actually quite good, and gives you a feeling of urgency as you desperately try to save the victims before the building collapses. Components are good, although I'm not a fan of the art, which is all over the place and lacks cohesion (nice cards, OK board, crappy victims).

Pros
- The fire theme really shines through
- The board tells you exactly what you need to know visually
- Cool fireman powers for characters
- You can bank action points to be used later 
- Creates a great sense of collapsing building
- Plays up to 6 right out of the base set 

Cons
- Setup isn't bad, but takes a little bit of rolling and putting fires around. After set up, it's super easy to manage.

I like this game but it's definitely not my favourite co-op game. It does do a great job of simulating a burning building where the bad gets worse and can get there extremely quickly! 

It has been well supported by Indie Boards and Cards through the years though and that makes it more appealing. The artwork on the board doesn't really match the excellent quality of the artwork on the cards but it's a minor quibble as the game overall still looks great.

This game gets compared to Pandemic a lot, so I'll start with that.  It's a cooperative game, where each player's turn consists of taking a few basic actions, followed by a progression of bad stuff where you randomly select a location and increment the bad stuff there, or, if the bad stuff is already maximized there, spread the bad stuff to the surrounding locations. The team consists of specialists, most of which have an advantage when doing one of the basic things, and your actions help you towards "winning the game" or "not losing the game, giving you more time to win the game". Usually, even when you think you're winning, a few "progression of bad stuff" turns in a row will go horribly wrong, and you'll lose the game every damn time, in an always tense and sometimes frustrating way, the latter case being followed by swearing and muttering about bad luck.

So yes, it's just a little bit like Pandemic.  If you're looking to buy Flash Point, how you feel about Pandemic is probably a damn good indicator of how you'll feel about Flash Point (I think I slightly prefer Flash Point, but it's close).  The main points of difference:

1) More players.  Pandemic is designed for 2-4, and you can do 5 if you really want.  Flash Point says 1-6 on the box (although 1 or 2 sounds downright miserable without multiple characters per player), and you could probably go all the way to 8 (the number of different characters available).  As I frequently game with 5-6, this is a positive for me.

2) More setup.  I was always a bit annoyed by the need to separate out the deck and shuffle 4-6 smaller decks in Pandemic.  However, Flash Point, not having cards, requires that you first start off by randomly rolling for initial fire placement (3 explosions start the game, each of which has slightly different rules for placement) and the appropriate damage and fire tokens, followed by hazmat placement, hot spot placement, and initial victim placement.  On the medium difficulty setting, you'll throw the dice 16 times before you even start the game.

3) More differences between characters.  Because Flash Point allows you to switch between characters mid-game, it's more appropriate for the characters to have more specialized abilities than in Pandemic.  The specialization, combined with the ability to store actions also creates new opportunities for coordination (e.g., the Paramedic delays her turn so the CAFS guy can clear a path to the victim for her).  However, some characters are so specialized that nobody else should bother doing their action, and/or they should do nothing but that action (I'm looking at you, Driver), which somewhat limits the reasonable tactical decisions.

4) A clear path to victory.  In Pandemic, since I don't know who is going to draw what color cards, and it's a pain in the ass to pass cards anyways, I frequently can't make any progress towards winning the game on my turn.  In Flash Point, there are 3 victims in play.  To help win the game, get to them or help somebody else get to them.  It's that straightforward.

Mediocre cooperative game. It is a very thematic game but I found very random the way the fire spreads. What makes matters worse is that each of the roles guides you how to play.

Nicely produced, very thematic and so very easy to pick up, even the experienced rules. First play was on easy difficulty level, and with 2 players we didn't break into a sweat. However, the "fire spreads" random events are completely independent; this compares to Pandemic where you see the same cards cycling over and over. There doesn't seem to be much room for clever strategy: I think this would make a very good family co-op game, but not quite the co-op I was looking for, so up for trade.

Just the family game so far, but I like this coop a lot.  My wife and I had a pretty easy time winning our first two plays, but some of that was just good luck in the die rolls.  For some reason I prefer it to Pandemic even though mechanically it is quite similar.  We will add stuff from the advanced game after another play or two using the opposite side of the board, which appears to be marginally more difficult.

We originally weren't interested in the game, but now we house rule the backstory so that victims don't die, but instead are rescued by another team and taken to the ICU.  You lose the game because you track record is so poor that your group is sent back to training.  It's probably our favorite game overall.

Awesome!  This game just drips theme, and that theme is well supported by the mechanisms of play.  

Each turn you really feel as though, you are battling overwhelming odds, in a desperate battle to rescue the victims from a house fire.  The mechanisms to advance the fire, including explosions, hazardous materials, damaged walls and doors, smoke and ever-expanding fire, gives it such a feeling of tension.  All the time you are balancing decisions about how best to use your actions; do I extinguish that fire or do I try to rescue the victim and let the fire rage?

It plays 1-6 players in around 30-40 mins, is simple to learn, with many ways to increase difficulty.

I'm a huge fan of Pandemic but this game has now surpassed it.  Whist it is not as tight and clever, the fire-fighting theme is an instant grabber for non-gamers, providing quick entry and easy understanding. 

I'm delighted I joined the Kickstarter program with this one, the artwork and production is beautiful and it came with fire-meeples and the Urban Structures expansion.

If you like family games that aren't competitive, then this is a near perfect gateway game to the world of co-operative play.  

If you are already a fan of co-ops, this game is a MUST buy.

A game almost killed for me by player enthusiasm. The problem with introducing your friends to every game they have ever played, is that they get easily fixated, and before you know it a few weeks go by with a single game being the only one you have played across two groups of people. In any case it is a great game, and I saved myself from getting sick of it.

Even though I am not a fan of co-op games, this one stands out. Its major advantage is the short play time and the god replay value. Even though I would not play it again more than once, I can acknowledge its qualities. There is a certain drama in the game and if play on veteran or hero level, you do have to struggle.

Flash Point is a neat co-op because of the theme.  The game mechanics are decent but its really the whole story that makes it great.  The only issue I have with this game is that a couple of poor dice rolls in a row and the game can take a dramatic turn and become almost impossible to win.  Luckily this doesn't happen often enough to impact the game as a whole.  Still, I can't help but feel that this game wasn't play tested as much as it should have been.

Flash Point is a decent cooperative board game that can be enjoyed by newcomers snd enthusiasts alike. It scales well with 1-6 players (although I haven't played the game solo yet) and particularly the fire-spreading dynamics are interesting in this game. There are multiple difficulty levels, two different boards, different roles and even a family mode for playing with young children. For veterans the game can be on the easy side; out of 9 recent games we've won 7 times with relative ease. Still it's a game that I'm usually willing to play.

Kickstarted.

I played it once and was just underwhelmed. We had an alright time with it, but it was more about the jokes we got to make along the way (like when my friend tried to rescue someone, wound up right beside them, and then watched as they got engulfed in flame before their eyes [tragic, I know, but cardboard people are cardboard people], or what a big deal I made out of making sure we had to save the cat). The game itself didn't hold me at all. Fire is entirely random, which is neat, but at the same time it's not necessarily exciting. I also found that I really disliked that, not only do you have the option to switch roles during the course of the game, but it's practically a necessary thing to do. I felt so disconnected from the pieces I was moving around when I went from being a paramedic to a deck gunner to something else. I guess I wanted to feel like I was one of the characters, and I wanted to play my role, but that was basically impossible (because you will need people who specialize at everything, and with too few players you won't get those roles. of course, if you have a full table of 6, so much happens between your turn and the next time you go that it's all but impossible to plan for most things).
Overall, it just wasn't for me. I can understand others liking it, and maybe some of the other maps would have been more interesting with their special rules, but the core of the game had no place in my heart.

Like Pandemic, it's you and your firefighter buddies vs. the burning house. It was an okay game, not too bad. But then, we started playing the more advanced difficulties that's when things really started to "heat up". So many propane tanks and hot spots. Practically impossible to end a turn without a flare up. Many times, there was nothing we could do. My friends and I just stood back and watched the house burn.

Not for us. Theme doesn't end up working, which is sad, because it's a great idea. Much of this may be due to the components which seem very kid game-like--colorful dollhouse-y board; cute, firehose-wielding firemen figures. Cards and box art are much more thematic, but don't help gameplay from feeling flat and mechanical, rather than tense and heroic. Shame.

I really like this game.
It works great as coop game and can be played with new players (at least the family version, or 2nd level vesrion).
However I played it mostly solitaire with 2 or 3 fire fighters.
During the Kickstarter 2014 I bought also the complete package. These expansion will probably only be played solitaire.
For the storage of the game I use several special storage boxes to keep the game with all the expansion parts organized.

Koop Spiel mit sehr gutem Solopotential.
Ich habe vor dem Kauf einige sehr positive Review gelesen und Videos angeschaut.
Das Spiel hatte als Kickstarterprojekt angefangen.
Das Spielmaterial in der deutschen Version sieht sehr gut aus. Anstelle der einfachen Holzmeepels gibt es hier farbige Feuerwehrmänner aus Weichplastik. Weiterhin haben die zu Rettenden alles Gesichter und nicht nur die Konturen der US-Version. 
Habe das Spiel Solo gespielt. Zum Einspielen in der einfachen Familienversion mit 2 Figuren (die trotzdem nur knapp gewonnen wurde weil mir das Haus fast über dem Kopf eingestürzt wäre). Und ein paarmal im ersten Expertenmodus mit 3 Figuren.
Thematisch ist dieses Spiel weit weniger abstrakt als Pandemie. Die Bedrohung durch das sich unvorhersehbar ausbreitende Feuer und möglichen Explosionen (bis hin zu verheerenden Kettenreaktionen) halten das Spannungsniveau recht hoch.
Auch mit einer Gruppe macht das Spiel Spaß (wenn denn die Mitspieler Koop mögen und ich mich nach dem anfänglichen Erklären der Regeln etwas beim Spielverlauf zurückhalte...).
Das Spielthema ist sicherlich herausragend aus der Menge der Koop-Spiele.
Hier gibt es eine ziemlich gut umgesetzte (kostenlose) Version zum Solospiel am PC als Java-Programm: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?93km82o9tpd601p]Flash-Point Java[/url] 
Man sollte jedoch die Spielregeln schon etwas kennen bevor man das spielt.

Acquired in Trade.  Having played it 'family style' once, it felt very mechanical.  Will have to play with character powers before finalizing a call on this one.

(After some time) I am keeping this one as a coooperative game to play with my young children and teach them about games.  In these play games with my four year old, I have been following 'rules' loosely.  I will scaffold in additional mechanics as he learns more about games.  Keeping primarily for this purpose.

RATING: 7
Good cooperative game with an approachable theme that is incorporated nicely into gameplay. Tension builds with the progression from smoke to fire to explosion with unpredictable chain reactions. The game allows players to be flexible by allowing them to switch special abilities mid-game and save action points for future turns.

Artwork is pretty bland. Because you can still win as long as you save a certain number of victims, it's sometimes in your best interest to give up on some victims if they are just not worth going after. Thematically, it's a little flawed because victims can be seen as expendable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played a 4P basic game, lost, then we blew it away by exclusively firefighting then doing virtually tension-free rescues.  Found the theme initially strong, and definitely good for bringing in casual players, but the advanced rules fell a bit flat for me on a later play.  Don't enjoy the hotspot reroll mechanics or turn-skipping for recovery, and the "hazmat" doesn't really seem too hazardous to me.  I still haven't played Pandemic, and this makes me want to.  Not sure how long Flash Point will last for me.

Only a few plays in, so I can see the rating on this game going up.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a fun, fairly fast cooperative game that is mechanically very similar to Pandemic or Forbidden Island (which is a good thing, IMO).  The game looks great and gameplay moves along well.  The characters are also well done.  

I only have 2 real issues with this game:

1. The way Points of Interest are put on the board at random.  Whenever you take a POI (be it a person, pet, or false alarm) off the board, a new one is randomly put on, and this can be very immersion breaking.  You could have just gone through a small bathroom and now suddenly there is a person in there?  I get that this makes sense mechanically, given the size of the board, but it doesn't make much sense thematically.

2. This doesn't get to the table much.  When my group wants to play a coop game, we either go with Pandemic (which is a little heavier and longer) or Forbidden Island (which is a little lighter and shorter).  Flash Point falls in this middle ground where we say "well, if we are going to spend 45 minutes on a coop, it might as well be Pandemic".  

I definitely see this rating rising as I get it to the table more.

April 2015:
My under 5 y.o. son and I watched a few games reviews to start a new bonding hobby together. We both got interested in the little fire fighters and it was our first pick at the FLGS. It clicked with us immediately and two new gamers were born on that day.

Flash Point is an excellent gateway game for the whole family. The theme is very engaging and it appeals to kids. I tweaked the rules to make it easier for my under 5 year old, but he is ready for family++ rules now (after less than 2 months). The difficulty scales up for adults and it plays solo nicely as well. Perhaps a bit random and swingy every so often (why would fire and victims pop up randomly here and there?), but I do not mind as it actually keeps adults as "helpless" as kids and lets them enjoy it together. Highly recommended!

June 2015:
Still enjoying it after many plays. However, I have been unlucky to set the difficulty too low on few occasions when playing with adults (or maybe dice just did not love us?) which made the game very mechanical, blunt and disengaging. Downgrading my rating from 9 to 8 as the sweet spot is a bit too fickly to find for my taste. But if you hit it, it can be a blast.

Even at the Family Rules level, this is a really fun co-op, with lots of tension based on the die rolls, placement of POIs, and spreading mechanisms. I really like the simple Action Point system (reminiscent of Pandemic), especially that you can carry over a certain amount of AP to a future turn, not a lot of games allow that. Normally, my friends and I will play this at Expert for the variable character abilities, Hazmat rules, Healing, and so forth, but there's something in the box here for everyone, and where in lesser hands Flash Point might have trivialized the fire fighting profession, I feel this really does it a service without coming off as too cute or silly.

As an EMT, I had high hopes for this game but largely found it to be random and void of meaningful decisions; everything is determined by dice-roll (nothing limits variance, like in Pandemic) and what each player should do seems obvious. And combined with the somewhat long set-up time, it ended up being an unenjoyable experience. 

The production quality of the game is quite nice and all the art-work is vibrant and enhances game play. Unfortunately, this is a thematic-game and those games aren't my type.

Nice topic for a cooperative game.  Played two games.  The first, in the basic mode, seemed quite easy and flat.  Not much to do.  Maybe we were just like.

I'm not a big fan of cooperatives, but I enjoyed and could play the game.  I guess the really difficult scenarios involve much more thrill.

Flash Point to me is kinda Pandemic meets ameritrash: in it, the elegant escalation mechanic of Pandemic is substituted by the randomness of dice rolls and, admittedly, by a much more appealing theme.

The family game, while not very deep from a gamer's perspective, is easy and smooth enough to be played with kids, and provides a fun challenge.

The expert game is much more challenging, and quite enjoyable even by gamers.

Rating is just a 6 for the family game, and 7 for the expert version. But I don't see any reason not to play with the expert game, so a full 7 is due.

One of the best family co-op games. This is my daughter's favorite co-op game over Forbidden Desert and Pandemic. At first I though that it might be too similar to Pandemic, but dice rolling gives the very different feeling from the card. Somebody might regards it too random, but I think that can match to the theme pretty well and it give me more thrill.

I had the Role that reduced the fire hose cost 2 AP.  90% of my turns were to use the hose aka Roll dice.  Otherwise I would bank actions for later turns or move the fire truck,  I rolled extremely well, which makes for a real boring session.  Even though we won, I still felt hosed.  I much prefer Pandemic.

I'm not much of a co-op player, but this one tickles my thematic bone in the most delightful ways. This is perhaps the most thematically integrated rules set I've ever played. My firefighter friend's jaw dropped when he heard the terms I was throwing around to describe the game mechanics. Everything that occurs in the game is realistic (to the extent that any board game can realistically capture the elements of a fire and rescue situation). Like most co-ops (Space Alert and Hanabi being my only known exceptions), the caveat applies that if you have an optimizer in your group who is going to plan everyone's turns for them, this game will be a dud.

Flash Point is fantastic, and the top co-op game in my collection. The theme is intuitive - people understand what firefighters do and how fire spreads, and so even new players can grasp the need to balance speed, fire control, and forethought. The expansions don't add a lot to the base game, but I won't complain about more maps.

I would not call this my favorite coop game, but the fact that my wife loves it and I can get just about anyone to play it and enjoy it, is a huge win. Although it's not my favorite, I still very much enjoy it. The only problem I have with this game is that it is so random in it's difficulty. And expert game setup could turn into a cake walk with lucky rolls just as easily as a beginner game could get completely out of hand. If that flaw were softened just a tiny bit, I might give this game a 10.

I agree with Tom Vasel who says it truly feels like you're fighting a fire. For theme alone I rate this higher than Pandemic. And the fact that it's actually beatable?! I truly enjoy this game. OK, the POI placement is crazy; people popping up in random places throughout. And it would be great if there were win conditions or mission objectives other than always having to rescue a set amount of victims. Maybe the expansions solve this issue. I will definitely be adding several to find out. Great game. Fantastic fun. Highly recommended.

This has been a huge hit with the family. We enjoy this more than Pandemic. I think it's because of the theme. We also feel like we're working together more. But part of it seems totally random. Like we could make the exact same decisions, but sometimes win, sometimes lose based on the dice. As we play more, I don't know if I feel like we're getting 'better' at the game. Just every once in a while, the dice go our way and we win. But even with that in mind, we still have a great time.

Fairly basic cooperative game but with solid mechanics and theme. I love getting to be an everyday hero in a game as opposed to a brave knight, raging dwarf, or international spy (not that there's anything wrong with those). Good decisions and tension. Good table talk about decisions gets going right away. Solid.

Fun game, but I'm almost positive my dice are loaded, the amount of times the fire seems to concentrate in one area... and I'm not even joking!  I think the dice rolls for fire placement is the only thing holding this back from higher ratings for me.

Had a great time playing this making crude comments about the hosers, teammates flying out windows, and leaving victims on the sidewalk to get run over by the vehicles circling the building.  Yes, I am a horrible person.

The game however was not anything like horrible.  But like many co-op games, it was rather light and very crowd dependent.  Table-talk and anything that lower inhibitions while playing this game, such as sugar, sleep-deprivation, etc, are recommended.

It suffers less from the alpha-gamer phenomenon than some games, but I could see it as a possibility. 

The thrill of waiting to see if one teammate or another would get torched was quite fun.  Though I do wonder what kind of person it makes me when I start to take glee in watching a fictional firefighter get launched out a window into the side of the ambulance.  

I'll leave it at: mixed-feelings.  I don't see any other way to play it though other than with levity, a large group, at the highest difficulty, and with bad-jokes all around.

Um, yeah, I like cooperative games. I always thought that Pandemic was the poster child when it came to themes everyone should like. I mean who doesn't want to fight disease? But I think Flash Point has just taken Pandemic's spot in that respect. Fighting fires is such a cool theme. Rescuing lives should get everyone excited. I'm amazed how thematic the fire is despite the random placement. The way the heat slowly progresses from smoke, to fire, to explosions makes sense. The idea that fire next to smoke ignites that area as well, is just purely logical. So not only do you have a fun theme, but you have a theme that is tightly woven into the game's mechanisms. I found the different special roles and the related abilities to be nice and diverse. Plus the roles kind of influence how you want to play that character, so I could see a different game experience if I played with another character. I will say that there were a few of the minor rules, like the fire truck, which seemed a little too much. At a certain point it feels like one too many rules for a new player to follow, but you can ignore those aspects of the game and focus on your character's job. This might, with more play, actually elevate to the point of replacing Pandemic on my Top 10.

Several plays of the family version with my... well, with my family.  I've played this with my kids, ages 3, 6 and 9.  My 3 year old needed some help, but was doing a lot of things on his own.  My 6 and 8 year olds really had a lot of fun.  Most of the plays are coming down to the final few choices.

The "experienced" game is even better with more variation and requirements and special abilities.  As a family game, this is a definite winner!

So far, I'm pretty impressed with how this game works.  There are a lot of similarities between this and other recent co-ops (e.g. Pandemic), but it really plays out differently with a higher degree of randomness.  It's kind of what I'd expect fighting a fire to feel like.

RATING: 7
Reminded us strongly of Pandemic (though the addition of dice make it perhaps a touch more random and luck based). Move your firemen round the building, keeping the fire down and trying to rescue enough civilians before the building collapses. Didn't enjoy it quite as much as Pandemic for the additional randomness which can overpower good or bad play much more than in Pandemic and also because the roles are more restrictive. In Pandemic, the roles give additional abilities so everyone can cure diseases but the medic can do it better. In FP, however, your role pretty much precludes you from some things, so everyone can put out fires, one guy can do it better than the rest, but the two "rescue" guys can barely do it at all (double AP cost makes it prohibitively expensive). As a result, I felt I had fewer decisions open to me.

Flash Point is just a decent cooperative game, nothing more, nothing less: its basic gameplay vaguely reminds of Pandemic while its advanced rules make it almost identical, as each player is given a specific role.

Since it’s easy to explain and isn’t too difficult to play either, it can be a good choice as a gateway game.

I've played many co-op games:  LOTR, Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Red November, Ghost Stories, and many more.  I feel like Flash Point might be the best co-operative game of them all -- at least the one I can recommend to the most people.  The theme is very real-world and approachable, and ties together with the intuitive game mechanisms very well.  And the game is very scalable in complexity, so it can be as simple as Forbidden Island or as challenging as Ghost Stories.  Players can even drop in and out fairly easily without messing the game up.

Far more interesting than Pandemic ever was, this is our new go-to cooperative game.  It's eerie how well it simulates a fire getting out of control.  Only issue is that it seems like more players makes it easier, as you have more specialists available without having to waste AP on a crew change.

This is one of the go to games for my wife and I. As mentioned before, we primarily play the basic game. It provides enough challenge to prevent us from winning each time, but still makes winning both achievable and challenging at the same time.

The instruction book was clear and easy to read, though early on, we seemed to refer to it frequently, especially with regards to explosions and how damaged walls and open doors can affect the game. 

The components are pretty solid and the two sided board does allow for even more variety. I suppose my biggest complaint is that the firefighters are different colors, but other than that are identical. It would have been nice to have had more unique characters, especially for the advanced mode.

Update: (Dec 2017) - My wife and I played this game as a four player beginner game and found this a bit cumbersome. It seems it is probably best with 3 as it always seemed like one player didn't really know what to do. Overall ratings not affected, but I would hesitate to put four in the game unless you are playing the expert variant.

 Overall Ratings:

Instructions: 8/10

Ease of Play: Basic Mode: 8/10

Components: 7/10

Replay Value: 10/10 (If you roll for where to place the fire/victims at the start instead of using the standard setup.)

One of my favourite games; everyone loves the theme of being a fireman, helped by the little fireman models from the later expansions, it's quick and easy to explain, and everyone usually has fun until the house falls in on them.

I tend to find that it's best not to let anyone take the pump specialist in a game with less than five players, though - it gets a bit overwhelming being able to douse so many fires, and leaves other players with rather les to do.

20 plays: a hit with everyone I introduce it to. very compelling and involving theme. A bit fiddly for my taste--too many little chits, too much reading the rules for the full version. But even the simplified family version is very involving, and everyone makes explosion sounds and prays to make it out with a victim before the building collapses. Fewer interesting questions of strategy than I would like; I'm seldom unsure of what to do on my turn. Given the fiddliness of the full rules, I wish the game decisions were more complex. But it's hard to overemphasize what a  massive hit this is with kids. I find myself really wanting to play more, and my 5 year old worships it.

Rivals Pandemic/Forbidden Island as THE introductory co-op game out there.  Beats them IMO because it plays up to 6 instead of 4, and difficulty is easier to customize with the addition of roles/hazmat/vehicles/hot spots all being modular.  Expansions also add a lot of flavor, probably a bit more thematic than most other co-ops.

Technically it's slightly more thematic than Pandemic, but the gameplay is actually very similar.

Not a bad game.  I played it once on the easy level and it myeh.  I could certainly see ratcheting up the difficulty would make the game more interesting.  However, I don't see this as particularly different from Pandemic.  It does support more players which is good but I see no reason to have this if you've already got Pandemic.

Success is greatly influenced by the random placement of the victims.  Fire spread is also quite random and can be either forgiving or deadly. 

Even so, the game is quite fun for what it is.  Adults and youngsters can enjoy.

Edit: after a few more playings: not sure what makes it so compelling.  Maybe it's that my wife and kids love it, but it is seemingly pure randomness.  Either way we keep coming back to it.

The similarities to Pandemic are apparent, and with the different theme and gameplay it is a refreshing addition to our coop games. The basic game was not too difficult to win, and will evaluate more with the advanced elements, but we all thought it was fun and fast-paced. Worth the playtime for what it offers. It also seemed that we were more on our own with the decisions that had to be made; if one firefighter goes for a victim, go for one of the other two that need rescuing; if all are being rescued, clear the room of smoke or fire; or haul out a Hazmat. UPDATE: Experienced Levels increase the challenge, making for tense games with out-of-control fires. Advanced elements are the way to go for a fun gaming experience.

Good coop game. Will need to play it some more with the expansions which may change my rating.  Once we had the rules right (buggered up the first 2 games) we lost terribly.

Cooperative game in the same vein as Pandemic, with an original and well implemented theme. I cannot assess how difficult it is, since I only played the hardest scenario once and suffered the most ridiculous dice rolls ever, but I guess people interested in the genre will like it.

Nice thematic co op. I've enjoyed every game so far. Lots of decisions to make when playing with the experienced rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I get a bit frustrated with this game, just because it's a classic Kickstarter job - good but unfinished. It has clever bits, but two core ideas - the hotspots and the roles - are really problematic. Too many of the roles (Hazmat Disposal, Imaging, Generalist) are lame and not that fun to play. The hotspots are frustrating because the game clearly needs them - the fire has to accelerate - but the mechanism itself is thematically vacuous in a game that otherwise pays fairly close attention to it's theme. Hotspots aren't hot, they aren't really more dangerous, the fire doesn't get worse there, they're just a die-roll trigger; it almost would have been better if they didn't have the "hotspot" thematic element.

I really wish this had been more developed. It's not bad, but it's weak in several areas that could easily have been overcome with some more development work.
---
Important Note: Make sure you're using a "good" d8. The one that came with the game doesn't work with the various rules sections that require you to "flip it over". It turns out that the heuristic we were using once we figured this out - making the faces should add up to 9 - is apparently wrong too. Either add or subtract 4, or the faces should add to 7 or 11. I am also suspicious of the quality of the die, we seem to get a lot of clustering.

Also, make sure you're playing the doors correctly - don't place two black cubes on a door that gets blown out, as the graphic design seems to indicate you should. If you do, the game will be impossible.
---
The basic/family game is very easy and fairly lame, but the "full" game is OK (I'd say don't even bother with the basic game, but the full game is complicated and fiddly enough and the basic game is short enough that I think it's worthwhile to start there). It's too random, and even with the hotspots it doesn't generate organic, escalating threat the way Forbidden Island, Pandemic, or Lord of the Rings do so well - it's much more of the "random stuff happens, do the best you can" than a game with real, well-managed tension. If you go after the fire aggressively early, you'll do fine, and there is an unfortunately high risk of the game being a boring cake-walk (if you roll "well") or impossible (if you roll poorly). But there is enough stuff going on in the full game to present tough choices from time to time. Unfortunately, all that stuff comes at a somewhat unreasonable cost in terms of rules and game complexity, so the bang for the buck is nowhere near as good as those three classics. Also, difficulty scaling with the number of players is a little uneven - large teams will have much more difficulty than small ones (this might be good; I enjoyed 5p more than 3p).

Also, too bad they couldn't include the "urban structures" in the base game (possibly by switching to card stock maps, or a paper overlay?). The slightly different difficulties and variations of the two included maps are quite helpful for giving the game a little more punch. I could see an additional pair of maps significantly increasing the replayability.

At the end of the day, a tough one to recommend. Vastly inferior to Pandemic, Forbidden Island, or Lord of the Rings. But it does play pretty quickly, and if you're burned out on those three or want a new coop in your rotation, not too bad.

A decent intro-level cooperative game.  However, for games in this vein, I'd much rather play Pandemic as the game play here is both less interesting, and seems to have less tension.

The actions in the game are very basic, as you'll usually be either moving or fighting fire, and you may some times do things like chop through walls.  The goal is to find victims to drag to safety, so the game is about fighting enough fire in order to get everyone to safety.

Overall, an OK game, but there are better alternatives.

RATING: 7.25
Intense coop that is extremely fun and highly engaging.  It's at its best when the house is ablaze, things are hectic, and you're scrambling to rescue people before the house collapses.

It does possess a moderate amount of randomness, however, as dice dictate how the fire spreads.  I find this more intense than say, Pandemic - which is much less luck dependent, so don't mind the odd game where it's a bit easier.

I am now ready to buy every expansion out there for this game.  Super fun, without one person taking over completely and running the game.  Can see this one getting plays with my friends who want to work together.  

Another I bought quite a while ago, and ended up playing someone else's copy of it. Fun game. This will become my go to Co-op with gamers (Pandemic is still more accessible...) . We played with all these really cool bits and pieces that I realised did not come with the version of the game I had and would need to buy separately... I am bummed out about this, but willing to pay the price if I can find them in all the right places. We all had fun and we didn't feel like pawns in the owners game of this. We all did what we wanted and were all burned to a crisp as the building crashed around our ears. We upped the danger level and made for an exciting game. I want to jump back in for more.

This games biggest flaw is that Pandemic exists. This is definitely a good game, and while some of the specifics may differ between the two, the play dynamic is very similar, as are the game lengths. However, because of how most of the roles are split into either purely for fighting fire, or purely for rescuing civilians, I find the individual turns themselves to be pretty obvious (more so for the rescuing roles) and quick, and a large portion of the game time is spent on between turn maintenance.

Similar to a game like forbidden island or pandemic, I thought this one played really well whether you did the family version or the advanced version. One of the things that I liked about it was that you can very the rules to suit your tastes. The advanced version adds a lot of things that I just found warrant necessary and warrant very fun. For example, hotspots. We almost never rolled hotspots and so they almost never affected us. So you could leave those off without much of a difference. We still lost hahaha. Things like making sure the victim gets to an ambulance made it ridiculously difficult. I liked the fire engine. So I would keep that. I didn't like the idea of being able to swap out your character, I mean play with this character that you drew. And next time you play try a different character. It also made it really hard to move people around the buildings because you could only move them to spaces and then your turn was over. Maybe there's a better way to deal with that. But it's very customizable!

Many of the core mechanics in this game (eg. use of action points, special abilities, the way the fire spreads) are derivative (see Pandemic), but they are so well integrated with the theme that this game is still distinct and worth playing.  The use of vehicles is neat, especially the ability to use the deck gun on the fire engine to put out fires.  I also like the flexibility that's required with regards to choosing your path into / out of the building, and the fact that you can chop through walls (causing structural damage at the same time) is very cool.  The game really does make one feel that one is wearing the boots of a firefighter.  I wish they had done a better job on the rulebook, though, and the player aids are poorly designed.

Great coop! It's actually my second best rated coop here only behind Ghost Stories. It's true it reminds a bit of Pandemic, which is another of my favorite cooperative games, but I think that the two are different enough to own both. 

I like a lot of the stuff going on in FP:FR, especially the simple gameplay which you can gradually increase the difficulty if you want. I think the family game is too simple and lacks a lot, but the advanced game with hazmats, hotspots, the various character roles etc. is very exciting and I always play that and on at least veteran level. I like the randomness of the dice, so even though it's not looking too bad you might suddenly be caught in a huge fire caused by a hotspot explosion which hits a hazmat and so on.  I also like there are false alarms and how you can chop down walls etc., and all in this game is a pleasure to play! 

The game takes a shorter amount of time than Ghost Stories, so I guess I will play it a lot in the future, especially with non-gamers and family members - though so far I've only played it a couple of times with gamers, and they had a good time too.

A reasonable co-op game, and although I don't like many co-ops, this one is kind of fun to play sporadically.

The production quality is very nice, and I think the theme is well thought out, too.  There is talking and cooperating, there isn't a "traitor" element, and it plays quicker and lighter than a Pandemic.

Bought it and taught it to friends. Playing solo on family mode was difficult, but with friends playing recruit the game was a breeze, as no one would roll the same spot *ever* (except for the constant toilet fire on 5-8 that was easy to control). Hopefully upping the difficulty will also up the challenge.

A quick and simple co-op in the same vein as Pandemic. Simple to learn, simple to play, very challenging. Main problem is that it is prone to one player telling everyone what to do if they have more experience playing and don't realize that they are basically playing the game solo.

Something of a provisional rating as I've played part of one game. Coop game decidedly in the mold of Pandemic. Shares a lot of the most appealing aspects of that game -- tension in spades, accessible rule set, relatively brisk running time. In fact, it bears enough of a resemblance (right down to the four actions per player, one special role per player, etc.) that I would be stunned if the designer didn't credit its forebear.

But comparisons can be insidious. Pandemic is very much a shared puzzle experience where the joy comes from collaborating on the best plan possible (within the scope of a sometimes-nebulous bit of half-information that comes from the fact that the game is driven by cards) and occasionally reaching into your stock of lateral thinking and realizing that the combination of my role PLUS her role PLUS this one event card we've been sitting on all game can flip a win to a loss in the last two turns IF Kinshasa isn't lurking on the top of the infection deck.

Flash Point isn't entirely NOT a puzzle, but what it really truly is a co-op tactical squad combat game -- a dungeon crawl with helpless fire victims in the place of the Amulet of Yendor and the Seven Keys of Vintoozler. You get in, you bash what you can, you loot, you scoot. It's a more visceral species of fun, one where the random elements sometimes bone you a way that Pandemic doesn't.

I don't know how much my reaction to this is colored by the fact that Pandemic was the first decent co-op game I've played and thus occupies a special place in my heart -- more than I'd like to admit, I'll wager -- but I do detect a distinct visceral vs. cerebral cleavage between the two games and my preference for Pandemic dovetails with my preference for the cerebral over the visceral.

That said, if your average co-op dungeon crawl was as well-designed as Flash Point was, I'd be a lot more interested in co-op dungeon crawls.

RATING: 8
Co-op game with different difficulty levels that actually make a big difference (as opposed to Pandemic, which can be equally impossible with a bad card combo at the easiest difficulty level).

Although it is often quite easy to determine what is the best course of action, there will always be a lot of adjustment to changing circumstances.

Player turns are fast and all have an impact on the game, so nobody will have to be bored even in a six-player game. Being able to change roles during the game is great, as is chosing your own role (which is not officially allowed in Pandemic). It helps give the game a team feel, even when playing solo with two or more pawns.

The experienced game (difficulty levels 2, 3 and 4) does require a bit of thought at first, but the rules are logical enough to be memorised after a couple of games. The easiest difficulty suffers a bit from a lack of diversity in the long run, but is still a very enjoyable way to include casual players in the game.

The materials are all high-quality. My only criticism in this respect is that the back of the game board, which is also used, gets damaged very quickly at the folds. This is purely an esthetic issue though. The design of the board content is the very BEST part of the components, in my opinion, as it is very clear and informative.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves co-op games. For those who feel even a burning home in a board game is bad, there is the consolation that you can at least chose to remove the dog AND the cat from the set of tokens used, so they at least will not be caught in the fire.

RATING: 6.5
This was a fantastic gift from my AU/NZ SS 2014.

My friends really like this game and one of my flatmates LOVES it. Since we all like playing games but I'm the only 'gamer' (i.e. I'm the only one who buys games), so it is great when you have other people requesting to play something.

One great thing about this game is how it has two sets of rules: the simplified game and the advanced game. This makes it easier to teach it to people - let them play the simplified version which isn't too complicated to learn, and then it isn't too difficult to teach them the rules of the advanced game. That's how we taught it to our friends and it seems to have served us well.

Another bonus: the double-sided board. Very clever to include this for added variety.

Update: My rating for this has slipped somewhat but it was a fantastic addition to my collection at the time. Nowadays I play with different people and this is a bit light for the group. However if you're looking for solid cooperative play other than Pandemic, this is a good choice.

I can finally fulfill my childhood (and adult) dream of being a fire fighter.  Great co-op that does a decent job of capturing the spirit of the rescue in game format.  So far we have only played easy settings and while somewhat challenging, not that difficult.  Waiting to see what the right setting is for a tougher experience and if the luck will even out to the bad side.

Flash Point is a tense, atmospheric co-op game in the vein of Pandemic.

Nice theme, but set-up is a little too long.  The random spread of the fire is actually kind of neat (and thematic), but the random nature does help to make games either really easy or really hard.  I like some of the special abilities, but others seem useless, and somewhat fiddly.

Very interesting cooperative game, in which players take the roles of fire fighters who are trying to extinguish the fire in a building and save potential victims. Each fire-fighter has a number of action points and a special ability (in the advanced game). The fire advances through dice rolls, which makes the game a bit random, but also very thematic (the chaos).

Not a bad co-op. I've only had the one game with five players and we won it quite easily. I suspect the scaling could be better as I think the extra player powers and the ability to specialize into roles is a much stronger advantage than the extra hot spots off-setting the extra players is. I suspect it'd be much more of a challenge with a group of 2 or 3. I also found it a little bit fiddly and cluttered with all of the smoke fire counters, hot spot counters, hazmat counters, POI counters, etc all over the board. And the constant rolling of the dice to determine co-ordinates started to mgrow tiresome after a while. And one final thing that didn't really work was the d8 supplied with the game didn't work with the "turn the die over" mechanism to put a co-ordinate in the right quadrant. Instead you just had to subtract the number from 9. Still I'd like to try it again with fewer players. Based on one play.

Good cooperative game.  Enjoyable to play.  This and Pandemic are my two favorite co-ops.  While difficult to capture the tension of a house fire (obviously, without lighting your game board on fire), this game does a pretty good job of capturing the problems that must be faced in such a chaotic situation.  Recommended!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game operates on a solid concept that feels a bit generic if you've played Pandemic. Placing points of interest right next to a firefighter is also thematically weird (didn't he see the cowering man next to him?...) The hazmats feel a little abstract, which isn't bad on a game of large scale like Pandemic, but do hurt the "genuineness" of Flash Point. On the upside, the game is rather quick-paced, which very nicely conveys the thrill of being in a fire rescue situation (I assume, as I've never had the misfortune of being in one on either end). I assume that the expansions patch up some of the genericness with more "thematic" options.

Very similar mechanisms to that of Pandemic, with a very different theme.  This is probably going to come down to which theme you enjoy more, but I have to say I prefer Flash Point's theming and components.  That said, it feels so similar to Pandemic (which we already own), that I doubt we'll ever purchase Flash Point.

This might be a good game if it wasn't for the poorly written rules that ruin it. Especially the German translation is often misleading, inconsistent (for example, 'flashover' is translated as 'Durchzündung' in the rules but as 'Funkenschlag' on the player aids) and in some ways unintentionally funny due to strange choice of words. My guess is that the translation was not written by someone with German as a native language. I may give this another try when it comes with revised/rewritten rules.

Same basic mechanics as Pandemic, Forbidden ___, and Defenders of the realm.  I'd say this is the best of those games though.

IF you just love coop games then this would be a must have.

I played this with an actual firefighter once.  Partway through the game I jokingly asked him how realistic this game was compared to actual firefighting.  His eyes ablaze, he grabbed me by the collar and shook me violently, screaming, "You think this is a GAME?  These faceless people NEED us.  We HAVE to go BACK in there!  Sandusky didn't die for nothing By God."  Then he grabbed his axe and smashed the door to my apartment to smithereens while screaming Sandusky's name.  As a result I deducted two action points from his total for the turn and have a strict No Axes policy at game night now.

Feels very similar to Pandemic but I think I might like this one a bit more. I can tell a lot of effort went into making the game systems consistent with the theme. Whereas Pandemic has a lot of game-y mechanics that are difficult to explain in terms of the theme; Flash Point is super intuitive and easy to teach. I do feel that while it misses having a hook like the movement cards also being used to cure the disease it makes up for it with the sheer number of moving parts it has. I've only ever played it with two players and it seems like it plays better with 4 players and up. Really fun even when we lose and the components are all gorgeous. I really like how modular the game is as well; you can really tailor the game to your playing group. Would like to get one of the expansions for this eventually.

I can never go wrong with playing a cooperative game.  This one does a great job in keeping with the theme of fighting fires and rescuing people out of the house. I really need to play the advanced rules now to see how that changes the game, as the basic version is rather easy to beat.  Great game!

Perhaps it's the dark side of this theme that kept me away (if you don't save someone...), or that it sounded like a retheme of Pandemic.  But I'm glad I got to try it, because it's a new and unique co-op game that integrates the theme well.

My main complaint is it feels a little fiddly with paying attention to hot spots, smoke igniting, walls getting damaged, etc.  I was lucky to have an experienced player teaching it to me.

Components: The boards are awesome (including in the expansion). Takes everything I love about floorplans and lets me run around in them putting out fires. The detail is great, and really enhances the theme. The firefighter figures in the second edition are very cool. The tokens are all top notch, and the art on the special roles cards looks great.

Experience: I didn't think too much of Pandemic while I was playing this game, which is to the game's credit. The theme absolutely works here. Fires are spreading left and right, we're finding all sorts of helpless people cowering beneath sinks and such, the walls are coming down, we're getting cut off from each other, there are explosions. Good stuff.

The special roles in the advanced game add some extra spice, and help to differentiate us from each other (e.g. I might forego putting out a nearby smoke, because it costs me more as the Rescue Specialist, but then later I regret it because that smoke turns to fire).

I've got to say, I definitely prefer this to Pandemic. Partly because I like the theme so much more. Pandemic is more abstract; just cube-covered dots connected by lines. But also because the choices are more difficult in Flash Point. In Pandemic, the uncertainty of the draw into player hands makes it more difficult to plan ahead, but when it's my turn, it usually seems pretty obvious what to do, with the only tough choice usually being between eradicating a disease and trying to prevent an outbreak. In Flash Point, my choices have less parity. Putting out smoke and fire is akin to removing cubes in Pandemic; but there's also the idea of discovering the identity of the trapped people, of deciding whether to break down walls; of protecting structural parts of the building; of closing a door behind me to prevent the spread of fire, or leaving it open for easier access. The geography of the floorplan is important, and I feel like I'm really having to coordinate with my teammates to make sure we are efficiently covering as much ground as possible.

My only real problem with the game, as with most cooperative games, is that the tension comes at us in the form of random events (the eruption of fire). I don't mind the puzzle aspect of this, but there is something missing when the game is merely throwing fire at us at random, rather than intelligently trying to outsmart us, trap us, cause explosions in vulnerable areas, etc. If we lose, I want it to be because we were outplayed, rather than because we didn't beat the odds. The only cooperative games I can think of that get around this issue are pre-programmed games (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, Eagle Eye Agency), where the game is deliberately trying to mislead us.

When this was new to us, we loved it. A tough co-op with a fire-fighter theme that we could all play together. These days it never leaves the shelf. I think the setup time is a factor and co-ops just aren't as much fun as a good game of Survive or King of Tokyo.

A thematic gem with a brilliant game design, two things that I personally seek out in any game.

A true corker.

Other high points:

* The game is presented with both basic and advanced rules.  The basic is for families with children; the expert rules are for more serious gamers.

* The game can be player with two players under an hour.

* The sheer brilliance of the advancing fire rules makes even the basic rule set challenging.

* The theme is outside the mainstream, which is truly refreshing.

Who knew firefighting was cool? Well, it can be! A tense yet simple full co-op game where you're attempting to rescue victims from a burning building, yet no matter how hard you try, explosions will occur out of nowhere and will progressively weaken the state of the building until it falls down. Great complexity-to-fun ratio for a co-op.

WARNING: The Heidelberger edition of this game comes with different POI counters wich do not match the original artwork style of the game but are rather sinister and in my opinion ugly computer designed, pseudo-realistic graphics. Personally, I recommend getting the English edition if possible as this makes the pieces on the board homogenous in style (and more beautiful). Also note that the Heidelberger edition is incompatible with the critically injured victims expansion.

Sold in order to buy expansions and fillers :) I enjoyed the game, but it was too reliable on the dice. If we were lucky, there was no difficulty (one of my games only had 2 explosions...); if we were unlucky, it was impossible. As I don't have a taste for luck, it was sent away.

Interesting cooperative game.  Much better than most I have played.  The goal is to save people, and to do so you need to put out fires.  Fires and victim locations are random.  So bad (or good) rolling can dramatically affect the difficulty of the game regardless of the skill of the players.

One of the latest additions and a very nice one. Thematic cooperative game where you have to rescue as many people as you can before the house collapses. Has a family version and also an advanced version, have yet to discover the advanced version, but the family game is challenging enough for now :)

Update: having played more games including the advanced game I must say that I like the game mechanics and theme quite a bit. A certain keeper in the collection.

Adds a little something to the successful co-op formula made popular by Pandemic. More randomness prevents the puzzle-feel that plagues Pandemic (see what I did there?), and the ability to change roles mid-game allows for a little more planning.

I don't often crave a co-op game, but when one hits the table, it will likely be this one.

RATING: 6.5
"AHHHH, it burns! Why does it hurt?!"
Why do these people have flammable cannisters just piled around their home? What is the cat doing on the stove? Why is there a black man trapped in the closet? Why are there so many people in such a small house? Who left a cigarette on the bed, and why won't it stay extinguished?!

I see a decent amount of parallels between this and Pandemic. However, I think I would always choose to play Pandemic over Flash Point. Mainly because I feel that Flash Point is more dependent on complete randomness when it comes to the dice-rolls for new fires and PoI's. Pandemic also has randomness for spreading the diseases, but it is controlled randomness that you can get a sense for -- you know that a location is either in the discard or still in the deck or has recently been shuffled back on top of the deck, or that a epidemic might occur soon and put the discard back on top. By comparison, in Flash Point, while unlikely it's entirely within the realm of possibilities to roll a never-ending series of explosive rolls; the dice mean that a game may be perfectly manageable because the fire spreads evenly and broadly, or a game is impossible because the fire keeps blowing up in the same places. In Pandemic, I feel like the CDC experts are predicting and trying to out-think the diseases and their spread. Flash Point also feels like firemen frantically trying to save people from a wild, uncontrollable fire; but I'd rather be out-thinking the destructive contagions than getting lucky with random nonsense blazes.

RATING: 6.3
Cooperative game in which the players have to work together in order to fight fire in a house and save its inhabitants. Each round a player has 4 action points to spend. If you don't spend them all 4, you can save what's left for a future turn. After spending his or her action points the player throws 2 dice in order to determine where a new fire starts, or if it was already burning, where an explosion takes place (this can make holes in the walls and force closed doors to open or open doors to be permanently removed). As soon as an inhabitant is discovered a new point of attention (=inhabitant or fake) is also placed on the map by means of the same 2 dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme in this game is so incredibly strong, even moreso than Pandemc, to which it is superficially similar.  The various maps offer different challenges, and the random spread of hazards combined with inherent dangers on the board are what build the constant tension that makes the game interesting.  The various character powers are distinct and all are interesting.  But the real innovation here is the ability of a player to swap out the character he's playing when the situation shifts to favor other special powers... but it takes precious time.

Well-implemented theme, but the game is quite long and repetitive. Pandemic, the obvious comparison, checks in at a more reasonable length. Also, Pandemic does a better job rewarding strategic play.

I bought this game to have a cooperative game that my family would enjoy playing.  

Finally I got them to play and it was a hit.  My little girls were so into, and concerned with saving people that they were engrossed in the theme.

Absolutely great game.  Excellent quality components, beautiful board, looks great when set up and being played.  We got a few really good cooperative games around the same time a few years ago (Forbidden Island, Pandemic, ...) and this is our favorite.  It oozes theme.  

We set it for medium difficulty and often the building collapses on our heads.  Great diversity of character roles.  Things happen somewhat randomly (where new fires pop up, etc.) but it is all about trying to control the situation.  Which means each player must utilize his character and work as a team.  If everyone makes a mad scramble to rescue victims, the whole crew is likely doomed.

Really great.

A co-op with no traitor and a high degree of randomness.   A lot of the game depends on the dice rolls for fire spreading.   Roll well and you'll do well.   Roll poorly and it will be a short game.

I got it as a Kickstarter add on.
So far game seems pretty easy and not too challenging. It's a fun family game of firefighting rescue operation, though.
Have yet to try it in advanced mode with cars, other rooms and expansions.

Fantastic all round. 
The theme works so well with the fire spread mechanics and the components are beautiful. 
The card art, map tiles and mini's are so good I was shocked to find they had brought out an expansion for even better mini's (that are based on the card art!)
I've played this game 2, 4 and 5 player and it scales extremely well, We've managed to beat the veteran difficulty in the 2 door house but not the hardest one. 

The company's release structure for this game involves lots of Kickstarter for large stock orders, it's on my instant buy list now when they next create an expansion.

There's something just wonderfully charming about this game.  It's highly accessible and the rules are not complex, yet it maintains an excitement and tension that heavier games strive for, but fail to deliver.  I find that Flash Point is one of those games that exemplifies the KISS principle and succeeds greatly because of it.

Let me start by saying, that even thought this is a relatively new game, and I'm probably still in the "honeymoon phase" of it, basking in the awesomeness of its newy glow, this is probably my second favorite coop game of all time. HOWEVER, its still not as fun at pandemic, and if you haven't played Pandemic: 1) Shame on you, you should run out and buy it NOW, 2) Disregard this review, because mostly I'm comparing them.

One question you might be asking yourself that I can answer is: Is Flashpoint just another Pandemic Clone like Forbbiden Island?" No, its not. They are both coop and have job cards and you move your pieces around a board, but thats pretty much where the similarity ends. For one thing, Flashpoint is much more random than Pandemic, which could be good or bad depending on what you like in a game. In flashpoint you roll dice to decide where new fires ignite. I think the mechanic for determining where viruses strike in Pandemic is better. Also, when you rescue survivors from the house, you HAVE to get them to the ambulance before a new event is rolled for. Which means, that you could walk into a room, grab a survivor, and then the next random roll puts another survivor right in the same room, What did you just step over then other guy last time you were in that room? In Pandemic you tend to move all over the board because the virus keeps spreading, but you don't find yourself returning to the same spot over and over and over like you do in Flashpoint. We actually decided that would be more fun is to have many different maps, with shorter games (ie, less victims to save, or maybe more victims on the maps as once (the game limit is 3). Also, and this is purely aesthetic, but I find the theme of Pandemic to be cooler than Flashpoint. I gave up wanting to be a fireman in about the 3rd grade, but it just so happens, that I am a scientist, so maybe I'm biased towards Pandemic for this reason.

Bottom line, Flashpoint is a great game, and in the coop gaming world, where there are less options, its currently one of the best, but its not THE BEST.

Co-op, Medium

A bit fiddly with the parts but very easy to teach and pretty fun.  Plays like a cross between Forbidden Desert and Eldritch Horror.  It's not very difficult but I'd for sure consider getting more expansions for this game.  I suppose one valid complaint is that the two maps the base game comes with can get stale very fast.

I've played the game only by family rules so far, five times.My score may very well change after I try advanced rules. It's quite challenging when played by 1 or 2, but we played  one game with 4 and one with 6 and it seemed too easy with that many firefighters!

I heard many reviews praising this game, which initially drew my interest.  I had it on my radar when I happened to come across it marked down at a bookstore - I grabbed it quickly and boy am I glad I did!  It did not disappoint.

Great coop with a decent amount of chance in it.  Not as harsh as Pandemic - to me that means it plays better with kids.  Granted, I've only played on the "family" mode so far.  Haven't been brave enough to introduce all of the advanced elements so far.  I like the flexibility that this allows, you can scale it up as you want.  Heck, the rules even TELL you to customize it/even bend the rules if it makes it more fun for you.. how many games blatantly say that?  Honestly, this game has the possibility to even replace Pandemic as my top coop game :-o

A hectic and highly cooperative race to dash through a burning building and save the residents inside. There is a little room for error but little time to spare. The accounting work that must be done each turn is annoying and really takes me out of the action, otherwise a decent game.

This was my first ever purchase from Z-man games and I was not disappointed.  I learned about this one by watching "Box of Delights" on youtube and it seemed like a good co-op game to play or possibly solo.  The nature of the way fire breaks out is random just like a normal fire would be and with good use of your imagination, it almost feels like you are in the movie Backdraft.  If you are a fan of Pandemic, you will enjoy this game as the components and theme seem familiar.  I haven't played using the specializations yet, but it sounds like they can add allot to the game along with all the hazardous materials.

Takes FOREVER to set up, and is ridiculously fiddly throughout. For us, that has killed replay since we take one look at the board at the end of the game, and immediately conclude we'd rather pack up than go through the agonizing process of setting up all over. 

Component quality is high, and the overall look of the game is fine. Sometimes it's even fun, but fml, that set-up saps a lot of good will...

[2 plays] This wasn’t extremely original—and maybe some of the coop games are starting to feel a little samey—but it was quite well done.  In this coop game, you're firefighters trying to rescue the inhabitants from a burning building.  

There are two levels of play, and I've only tried the basic level so far; we played once with the designated first-game setup, and once with the layout on the reverse side of the board.   I don't think you likely ever win this one in the sense of putting out the fire or saving the building.  Victory is defined as rescuing a certain number of people, and you have to balance your rescue efforts with your firefighting efforts; if you focus only on rescues and let the fire rage too far out of control, you may not be able to get to other victims, or the building may collapse (which means you lose).  

At the advanced level, there are Pandemic-style roles for the players; you become specialists in different skills.  This seemed like it would be fun, but require a bit more teamwork.  I would recommend playing the basic game first.  

One of the first things that struck me about this game was a sentence on the player aid that I can't recall ever seeing in a game before: you can SAVE leftover actions!  You have 4 actions per turn, and can bank up to 4 actions.  This is a really useful mechanic.  If you have one action left but need to do something that costs 2 actions, you don't lose the unused action, but can hoard it for later.  And having extra actions can let you successfully do things, like run into a room that's all ablaze and drag someone out, without standing there risking the flames.  

The production quality is excellent.  I think some things in the copy I played with were Kickstarter bonuses, though, like the wooden firefighter meeples.  But overall the quality is good and the design is clean.  The board comes with a different house on each side, and then there's a second board with a different building on each side.  That allows for a number of different scenarios.

Some of us found it mildly disturbing, on a thematic level, that saving the pets was just as important as saving the people.  Other than that, the only thing I disliked about this game was the fact that there are only three victims in the house at a time.  (When one is rescued or perishes, another is randomly generated.)  We played with 4 players, but I understand that even at the max of 6, there are only 3 victims.  Occasionally you feel like you don't have anything constructive to do because there aren't more people to rescue.  

On the whole, good game.  I would certainly play again, and look forward to the advanced level next time.

Ideas for adding elements of advanced rules gradually: 
- random setup of 3 explosions
- add vehicles (deck gun/driving makes game easier, ambulance requirement makes game harder)
- add specialists and hazmats/hotspots (specialists make game easier, hazmats/hotspots make game harder)

Feels like a grown up Pandemic. I appreciate what Pandemic brought in 2008, but this design has far more going on such that it totally and easily fires Pandemic. 

There's some nice lateral thinking in how you can run out to the fire truck and change roles, get something done, then go change again. Like change into a dog, pull some victims out, then change into a firefighter and spray some fires. The ambulance and fire truck add nice peripheral decisions for the actions of your characters. For example, you have to load the victims into the ambulance, not just pull them out of the fire, so you want to move it to where you plan on exiting. Touches like this feel like they were quite smartly incorporated and not tacked on.

Lastly, the different maps and scenarios are a huge improvement. It's much more fun to have different maps to play each time instead of the same one over and over.

All in all, I'm impressed. It's still a light game that relies on the old school design of co-contribution more than cooperation and can lend itself to Alpha Player Syndrome, but there's enough going on here to make it worth the occasional play for me.

What I love about this game is that the "family" variant of the rules makes it perfect for playing with smaller members of the family. But you can still ramp it up with the advanced rules, harder board, specialties provided by the expansions, etc. High replay-ability. Mechanics used for advancing the fire add a touch of realistic tension to the game. Also love that it's fully co-operative. Just wish it came with a proper insert - however, I'm going to ditch the annoying cardboard filler that it comes with & make a foamboard insert so everything fits properly.

I like this game a lot and definitely better than Pandemic.  It feels much more thematic to me for some reason.  I think it's because of the lack of cards; there's nothing to do but run around the house saving POI's and extinguishing fires. Plus you can't "game" Flashpoint like Pandemic because the fires spread by roll of dice (which I like).

This is my favorite co-op game in my collection because of the following:
1) It tends to avoid the Alpha player issue who will say in other co-op games what you must do or else each turn;
2) Fire and poi (points of interest - people to rescue) generation provides surprising and tense results that usually leads to a variety of player choices each turn; and
3) It is very engrossing thematically.

Sigh, its not very interesting.
Decisions in a turn are pretty obvious, and not very interesting, whilst there are 8 or so possible actions to take on  a turn inevitably you end up looping through 2-3 of them, noticeably move, fight fire, pick up person. 

And there is no pre planning or strategizing here at all, as everything is too random. Where people turn up, where fire starts etc ALL based upon completely random dice rolls, I think I will definitely stick with pandemic.

RATING: 7.5
I like this game a lot and find everyone I introduce it to like it as well.  It is very easy to explain because the actions you can take are very intuitive.  This game is great for new gamer (or non-gamers) because what you should do on your turn is intuitive (hey there is fire beside me, I think I should put it out).  Even if it is not the optimal play your new players will feel like they are contributing and they will be able to make the decisions themselves.  Additionally, the roles in the game do assist players to narrow down what options they would want to do on a turn (some players will specialize in fire, other is saving victims), so that reduces thinking time between turns.

I do find this great for more advanced players as well because you do have to plan ahead and there are harder maps.  The fire is random, so it keeps you on your toes and makes the game different every time.

I had avoided Flash Point for a long time, thinking that it may just be a slightly more family-friendly clone of Pandemic. But I was pleased to learn that it while it has some similarities, it's really its own game with its own feel.  My children were totally immersed in the theme of this game, and felt like firefighters with different jobs doing their best to save lives.  I think Pandemic is a little more gamerly and feels a little less random, but Flash Point is not all random either.  I think it's every bit as tough to win as Pandemic and in the end, I like it just a little more. The integration of the theme is superb with the tense anticipation of watching the fire spread, and the desperation of seeing the building start to collapse around you.

This game is fab, I love it. Co-op games are my favorites, and the theme of this one is unique and deep, and the hilarity of constantly spawning victims to save, often repeatedly in the same room, makes the storytelling aspect very fun as well. "Now, where did Muscle Tee come from? Under the sink? Was he hiding there waiting for Professional Suit to leave for work so he could continue his affair with Redhead?" My friend (who owns the game, and most of our games) and I call this game "Crispy Cat" or some variation, as our failures have tended to hinge on the destruction of the crucial kitty cat victim. Cats and dogs are just as important as humans! It's also hilarious to us that the female firefighters are all dolled up; never look less than your best, even in the middle of a raging fire!

Nem különösebben érdekelt, mivel egy pandemic klónnak gondoltam, kicsit módosított témával. Ez annyira nem is áll messze az igazságtól, de valamiért mégis hangulatos volt játszani vele. Jobban bele tudja élni magát az ember egy ilyen tűzoltásba, mint a világszintű járvány visszaszorításába. 
Viszont a grafikai megvalósítást egyáltalán nem értem. Szerintem itt nagyon fontos lenne, hogy minden tipp-topp legyen, de valahogy szedett-vedett az egész.
Összességében a pandemicet választanám a kettő közül, mert valahogy annak jobban tetszik a játékmenete, de ennek a hangulata magával ragadóbb.

While the family game is hardly worth playing, the advanced game feels fairly similar in style to Pandemic, including various specialists and attempts to put out fires wherever they flare up (more literally, however).

Yet another cooperative game that draws its pull more from the thematic integration than its novel gameplay. Quite a hoot for puzzle fans, I would expect.

The first few play throughs, this game is very exciting and fun, but as you play more, you begin to see the repetitive nature of this game. Roles begin to be divided between just firefighting and civilian rescue and this gets quite old after a while, but it seems to be the best way to win the game by far. The mechanics behind how the fire spreads is a pretty exciting part of the game and it can make the game pretty challenging; one of its high points. I find myself, however, never wanting to play this game just because the strategy of the roles is not complex enough for me.

I have a somewhat strange relationship with Flash Point. It's a game I can't really fault much on its gameplay or its components, and yet it fails on all levels at delivering a compelling experience. First of all, I find the theme terribly boring. I must confess I didn't buy the game. It was offered to me. If I look past that, the game design works well for the most part, and yet its entertainment value is very low. Once you figure to focus all your efforts on containing the fire first and only then rescuing victims, playing always feels more or less the same. If you think of the situation it depicts, you should feel tension and excitement as you play, but they're largely absent. As for the art, it falls into the same pitfall. Map and cards and counters are properly done, they're not ugly, but they don't have more personality that a collection of clip arts. If I look at the games in my collection, plenty are more flawed than Flash Point, and yet it is the last one I'll pick up. It's quick to set up, the rules are simple and effective, but it feels like a chore to play, and this is hard to forgive. In the end, Flash point is so uninspired that it just fails to inspire.

Been playing this more and more recently. Both the family version and the expert can be fun. I find that like most coops the most fun is when the win is in doubt until the final few moves.

I have been interested in this game as I am a big Pandemic fan and would like to see what else is out there in the way of co-op games. Flash Point shines in terms of theme. There really is no other game like it in that sense. Play is very linear and everything makes sense in terms of mechanics. Overall, very impressive. It appears there is a lot more luck in this game than Pandemic, which made me feel like I did not have the greatest control over what needed to be done. As well, decisions seemed very apparent - so much so that there wasn't too much room for multiple paths for success and as such the player interaction was surprisingly low for a co-op game. I really would play this one again, if only because I think there's a good game in there and one that is probably found after repeated plays. Oh, the fire totally consumed our asses. And I even tried to save the cat...

Flash Point: Fire Rescue udmærker sig ved at have et meget familievenligt tema. Til gengæld har det hårde odds imod sig, da det er en genre (de kooperative spil), hvor der er kommet mange fine spil de seneste år. Grundlæggende er jeg meget positivt stemt overfor spillet, men jeg syntes desværre ikke det i de spil jeg har spillet har formået at give den samme pressede fornemmelse, der gør at man sidder yderst på stolekanten som f.eks. Pandemic og Ghost Stories giver. Det familievenlige tema er det, der kan redde spillet og så har jeg endnu ikke prøvet udvidelseskortene, der forhåbentlig kan tilføje noget af det savnede.

Fun most of the time. When the fires are going out of control and you're scampering around, it can be exciting. If the fire is under control, more or less, then not so much. It's been a challenge for us to hit that sweet spot, where it's not too easy, not too hard. Sometimes we love it, sometimes I find it a little slow going.

Update: Gets a little repetitive. It's fun when you are in danger, and so can end kind of quickly and you feel like you're getting overwhelmed. If you're under control, on the other hand, it feels very perfunctory, go here, do that. Hard to hit that sweet spot where there's palpable tension that's sustained. Downgraded to a 6.5.

Update: Doesn't grab us the way other games do, and so sold it.

This was a pretty cool co-op game. I'm not really big on them, but I did have fun with this one. I'd definitely like to try it again and especially with the expansion rules, to see how they affect the game play.

The components are standard fair. Nothing to bark at, but they suit the purpose and work well.

Players are working together to try and put out fires and save people and the building, before they spread and burn down.

I'm really hoping to get to try this one again.

This is a solid and super-fast coop that is pretty darn fun, and it super easy to teach to non-gamers.

Acquired February 2012 from BGG Replacement Secret Santa 

2012 March -- I have played two learning games with three players. Although it looked complicated, it is easy to learn and play. We have played only the easiest version so far, but found it very enjoyable. I look forward to trying the more complex rules and board, but we first need to introduce it to my wife and daughter. I think they will enjoy this game, as they do like Forbidden Island.

OMg the fire is everywhere! Put that victim down! Stop the fire before  ... the building collapses. Talk about a hectic game, if you don't work together, game over! I recommend always playing with the specialists. It adds so much more. I love manning the deck gun, but for crying out loud someone go put out the fire in the middle! My gun barely reaches!

So to make sure this is clear. The game is not fun unless you play with the specialists. Do not play family mode.

Tip: games are so much easier to when if someone plays the fire captain. Don't ignore the fires! They build up fast!

RATING: 7
The most obvious comparison for Flash Point is the game Pandemic. The two games are very similar in style, weight, and length. My experience has been that the decisions and tactics are much easier and more straightforward in Flash Point. For this reason, I prefer Pandemic, although I would recommend either game to fans of cooperative play. Those who prefer a game with a very concrete, realistic, and vivid approach to its theme may favor Flash Point. Flash Point gets an A+ for theme, whereas Pandemic feels more abstract and game-y.

The other element that leads me to prefer Pandemic over Flash Point has to do with the way that the two games handle randomness. Pandemic uses cards, which gives it two advantages over the dice that are used in Flash Point. First of all, the card-based system of Pandemic allows for the diseases to strike the same locations repeatedly. The epidemic cards are so deadly because of the way that they stack the top of the deck. That just wouldn't be possible with dice. Secondly, all of the dice rolling in Flash Point gets to be a nuisance. The turn-to-turn upkeep is more fatiguing, and a lot of that has to do with the dice.

Finally, I really really really really hate the graphic design of Flash Point. The character cards are nicely done, but everything else looks like it was designed by a colorblind person. The board is way too busy and the colors are way too saturated.

I love cooperative games to begin with. But what puts this over the top for me is the theme. This game OOZES theme! Yes, it can be over in a hurry as the fire blazes out of control. Yes, it can be a cakewalk at times. And yes, we've played sessions of 6+ consecutive games, all on the same board, all unsuccessfully, and enjoyed it every time! It's just really, really fun to play. It can be a bit daunting with all of the expansion material and special rules, but the basics are simple enough to introduce to even casual players and the cooperative nature of the game makes it even easier to get them involved. And did I mention the theme?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Two plays of the basic game, one with three and one with four. A somewhat bland co-op game. The game situation is a bit too simple—there aren't many tough decisions—and a player's ability to accomplish something satisfying on their turn is limited. On top of that the fire mechanism is a little too random for my taste.

I wouldn't say that the game is boring or bad, but it's not really exciting either.

This game has so much of what we love. Cooperative strategy, options for difficulty and mechanics, an immersive theme, and various boards with the expansions to keep game play fresh and adapt to different comfort levels with gaming and/or different desires in terms of weight and game length.

I also found that the game negates "bored when it isn't my turn" because constant communication is imperative to keeping on top of the ever-changing board. Stop to read emails while other people did their thing? You missed three explosions, a rescue, and the collapse of a wall and now you're trapped and need to bust down a wall to get out. I also didn't find that quarterbacking was an issue, mostly because after every play turn the fire evolves and plans can't usually be made in advance. It's very much a react and hold your butts kind of game.

We loved it so much that we immediately played three more times and then had to force ourselves to play something else.

This is the ideal game for our household.

As one who loves a game that captures it's theme well, this one does it in spades. You really feel like you are struggling to fight the fire and save the people inside. A well designed game that works well with a varying number of players. The expansions are also a lot of fun. We have spent countless hours playing this coop and will spend many more thanks to the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even with just the beginner rules this game is fun. It has a good rollercoaster of excitement going as the fire starts and is put out that keeps each play unique. Feels very rewarding to play. With the advanced rules this turns nail-biting very quickly. It still feels very fluid with the additional rules/roles and keeps itself rewarding. Expansions are all excellent. Heroic difficulty is a serious challenge, still haven't beaten it yet. Game has a bit of a nice decrescendo to it once the fire is under control.

Sometimes the game seems overly difficult as a result of poor rolls, but in these situations we tend to just restart the scenario or laugh at how screwed we are.

Have Dangerous Waters, Extreme Danger, Honor and Duty, Fire Dog and Veteran, Tragic Events.

The first time you play it, it's a blast, but after the fifth time, it gets a little like "I've played this before, and It's obvious what to do"

The first two games we lost, then after that every game we've won including on a very hard level. So once you figure out the strategy all the fun goes away. Yes, losing is fun. 

It's great fun to play with people who've never played it before. Yet if anyone wants to play, it's a family friendly game that everytime I play it is kinda fun.

Cooperative games just aren't my bag. I played as the Driver/Operator, so it only made sense for me to drive around in the truck and use the deck gun. There wasn't much for me to think about.

On the other hand, the theme and mechanic are very well integrated. If you like co-ops, you will probably like this one.

A much better game than Pandemic where you don't have much freedom of choice.
In this game, you get to choose where you start, where you go and what you should do, whether in basic or advance game, unlike pandemic where the game tells you "where to go" each turn.
Your play is not dictated by the game, even if you are still not in control of much like in Pandemic. You still are free to go wherever you like, pretty much like in Arkham Horror where you are pressed in time, but still can do whatever you like.

Better than Pandemic (since that's too abstract for me, with a world overview). I really like the role playing element of Flash Point Fire Rescue. You really feel like a firefighting team.

Flashpoint is a very good cooperative game.  It is usually tense, exciting and challenging, creating a delectable sense of urgency that real-life firefighters must experience whenever they enter a burning building.

Egy klubnapon játszottam vele és nagyon megtetszett. Most már itt figyel a gyűjteményben.:)
Nagyon jó a téma (nekem kifejezetten tetszik). A szabályok könnyen érthetőek, igazi csapatmunka kell a sikeres küldetés teljesítéséhez.
Mindenki a kedvének megfelelően be tudja állítani a kívánt nehézségi szintet, valamint a szabálykönyv leírja, hogy a benne leírtakat is szabadon lehet kombinálni nehezítve a családi játékot, könnyítve a haladó verziót. Ez is nagyon tetszik benne.
A tűz terjedése a kockadobáson múlik, ami elég magas szerencsefaktor a játékban. Én imádom, igazi kiélezett (hősies) helyzetek alakulhatnak ki.
Ha a csapat a kimentendő áldozatokra koncentrál, akkor hamar leég a ház. Érdemes a tűzet oltani, "kezelhetővé" tenni és mivel nincs időkorlát a játékban az áldozatokra ezután koncentrálni.
Igaz kedvenc!

A superb replacement to Pandemic.

Love the artwork (for the firefighters) and the different difficulty setting.

My only con with this game, is the very utilitarian art of the board. Somehow, I wished it could be a more "dynamic" art, less "architectural plan". But I understand it is needed for the gameplay.

The expansions look fun, will have to try them out.

RATING: 9.8
Pandemic is my favorite game. I have logged around 75 plays since picking it up back in 2013. I am not sure why it took me so long to get this one on  the table. Perhaps because I had a bad experience with Defenders of the Realm and the dice scared me away. Anyway, I just started playing it last month and have already logged 21 plays with the base game. What makes it so unique? For me it is the pace of the game. It is not as much of a brain burning puzzle as Pandemic, but running around, putting out fires, and saving people is just exciting. I have had a few games ruined by dice rolls, but that is certainly the exception rather than the rule. I play on the back of the board (harder side) typically on veteran with 4 random characters. With that my win pct is right around 60 or 70% which for me is the sweet spot, it is a very well balanced game that scales well with different player counts and difficulty levels. I have played about 10 heroic games on the back side as well, pulling out wins in 3 of them. I am not sure I like it that hard though, many of the losses I never even had a chance to win. Will it replace Pandemic? Never. It provides a great alternative. I can play 2 games in the same amount of time and the experience is similar enough they are comparable, but different enough that I feel they have managed to completely differentiate themselves.

The theme lends itself very easily to a co-op, and there's some tension along the way. But there are too few sensible options to choose from each round (it's often rather obvious what you should do), and every role feels quite "locked" in what you should do.
Should play fine with families, though.

Wanted for a while to play with my children. Then it came up in a flash(!) sale on amazon for £22. Stepped up and took it!

We played, and my children were really impressed. I find it is the perfect compromise between child friendly, and interesting enough to keep an adult awake. The enthusiasm from my two under 10s, was infectious.
So, family friendly, simple to learn, vibrant design, tactile components, and enjoyable. 
Only played the basic game so far, but 3 times and it's been fun every time. I think the wee ones are ready to handle the advanced rules next outing.

First game: We were 1 action point short, poised at the space in front of the exit, 6 survivors down, my firefighter with cat in hand. And the building came down! 
Think we will get lots of family time plays out of this one.
The children have been saying 'that flippin cat' every 5 mins since dinner! Fab.
-------------------------------
Well, I read the extra rules beyond the basics, ready to introduce them to the children. But after reading, they sound clunky faffy and to be honest, rather shit. I will try them solo, but the thought of putting them into practice means it could be a while. Bad times.

This is a clunkier version of Pandemic. A fun co-op with a more palatable theme to bring new gamers into the hobby. This one just lacks some of the fun element others have. Though it is still fun and we do enjoy playing it.

A solid co-op game for 2 or more! I truly enjoyed playing this one with my wife! The fire is randomly placed on the board and tends to shockwave throughout- which is an excellent mechanic to the game! Before we knew it, the building was collapsing and we had to switch strategies! Top notch!

Played at Salt Con.  Pretty decent ripoff of Pandemic.  The theme really comes through in gameplay, although there are definitely some wonky spots (the survivor token rules for instance).  Our play turned out very easy but evidently that's not too common.  I would play it again but won't seek it out.

I think this is the only full co-op game i like.. the structural damage, the smoke wich turns to fire, the special character types.. great.

But it's just a co-op game.. that means once you have figured out the best strategy to beat the "system".. playing becomes boring..

A co-op game themed around Firemen that is somewhat similar to Pandemic.  A little more luck involved here since the fire progression is done via dice.  This has ended up being a good game to play with more casual gamers.  I own most if not all of the expansions as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
This coop is a challenging, quick-playing and interesting game, even at the Family Game level, and it's many boards and specialists ensure variability for some time to come. (Funded via Kickstarter)

It is dice-dependant, and therefore luck comes into play, but the play choices and options make the game more than a meaningless luck fest.

I'm starting this at a 7.5 - just a terrific game, and one I expect to see climb higher as more folks learn about it.

Updated 11/28: No, this is a truly awesome game - 8.0
Updated 07/29/14: Adjusting this to 7.75 - still an awesome game, but I have gradually swung to feel that the role(lls) of luck in the game weaken it slightly, because there is no way to fade your luck- either you get the victim POIs out early, or eventually the building will collapse on you. (Literally)

I know this is a popular game, but for some reason it just wasn't for me.  Felt a bit soulless and rote.  In the end I recycled parts for other purposes and trashed the rest.  Rare is the game that elicits such a reaction from me.

RATING: 7
Good co-op. Reminds me of Pandemic, but definitely its own game. Nice components and great tie-ins to the firefighting theme. We had fun with the player roles and swapping them out was a fun tactical decision. This is a bit of a nail biter from the potential victim deaths and the structural damage.

Rating after two plays with the basic rules (two players). The first time we played, we started with two explosions and never really stood a chance (building collapsed on us after saving four people). The second time, we won without using a single damage marker. 
I see lots of potential in the game, and we certainly did have fun. Should be more dynamic with more players in any case, and I am looking forward to playing this again. I hadn't been very interested in the theme at first, but got drawn into it quickly.
Update after third play: The game has lots more possibilities with the specialists, but the feeling remains largely the same. I am still slightly bothered by the high luck dependence, but would play it again anytime.

RATING: 3
(05/18/2012) Comment based on one play.

This is yet another cooperative where random crap happens, and it is a desperate race to accomplish some task before the game kills you. Perfect fodder for alpha-males, which is the bane of most cooperatives.

While it is based on a solid theme about firefighting--you can swear the theme from "Backdraft" is playing in the background--the mechanics are somewhat bland. Admittedly, play is simple and straightforward, based on an action point menu, and each player in control of a firefighter with unique abilities. While there is very little downtime, I was left with the feeling that I had no control over the outcome. Fires sprung up here and there, based on dice rolls, and if we were unlucky--which was most of the time--explosions occurred, structural integrity of the building suffered, and victims were killed. Exciting for those who enjoy plenty of randomness and chaos. I'll steer clear of this in the future. I rate it a '3', with room to drop.

On a side note, this is yet another data point for me to stay away from Kickstarter games. Most Kickstarter games seem to be lacking in game development or polish, having not gone through the traditional vetting process. If one is successful in generating a lot of buzz, it is possible for many mediocre and relatively unsophisticated titles (compared to today's state of the art) to be published. Buyer beware.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is fun, tense, and moderately quick to play.

Thanks to the abilities, maps, and perfect amount of (thematic) randomness, we'll be playing this as a family for a long time. We've had great success playing this with longtime gamers as well as those new to the hobby.

Egyet emeltem a pontszámon 5-ről 6-ra mivel a karakterekkel már szórakoztatóbb, de még mindig úgy érzem, hogy kevés igazi döntési lehetőségem van. A karakterem meghatározza mit kell csinálnom. Valószínűleg a karaktercsere segíthet ezen.

This is a decently fun co-op. I can't decide whether I find the theme appealing or somewhat gruesome (people might die in a fire due to decisions you make, and you're sometimes choosing which one you want to save, and which to abandon). There's a fair amount going on and while it seems clear that the main thing you have to do is save victims, there's definitely an advantage to some of the other actions.  I'm not sure whether I like the way the game forces you to play a certain number of rounds by simply not allowing the victim chips to come onto the board very quickly, but it probably does make the game more interesting.  Ultimately, I'd say I enjoyed it, although I'm still not exactly sure what makes me like one co-op more than another. (1 play)

This game totally exceeded my expectations: You really get engrossed by it.  The rule book could be organized better, and the wording could be improved in some places (e.g., the Fire Captain card should say that you can command others to open doors, not just move, and the Paramedic card should say that you can't lead more than one victim), but once you get the hang of it, the game itself is fantastic.  This is the best cooperative game I've played so far (formerly, that honor belonged to Pandemic).

Relatively easy to learn and entry point game for casual players while using the basic rules.  Advanced rules add a lot more depth and introduced new mechanics that take this from 'light' to 'light-medium'.  Luck of dice rolls and strategy go hand-in-hand.  Nice board, thick cardboard chits, and plastic cubes make for average components.  Would have liked to see different sculpts on some of the firefighters, (but I understand you can buy those separately).  Double sided board with a few expansions (not included) and with solo rules make this highly replayable and quick..say..30 minutes.

Tabletop Day 05/04/14 met Ward in het Stadhuis van Antwerpen. Coöperatief spel waarin je als brandweermannen zeven slachtoffers uit een brandend gebouw moet redden. Wij deden de familieversie. Je speelt achtereenvolgens vier acties (verplaatsen, deuren openen, muren slopen, slachtoffers dragen, brand of rook blussen), dan dobbel je om te zien waar een nieuwe rook- of vuurhaard komt, en dan dobbel je ev. nog eens om nieuwe te redden objecten toe te voegen. Speelt vlot en vrij snel; Ward vond het een heel tof spel.

I remember enjoying it, but not feeling the need to play it ever again. Don't get me wrong I will if someone wants to. Sort of reminds me of Pandemic but more fun (though I don't much like Pandemic). I really just remember the main enjoyment of the game coming from laughing at how some people would just appear in rooms we'd already cleared, as though they'd been hiding in a closet or under a bed and didn't think they needed to call out for help at first.

Good game, reminds me of Pandemic with dice instead of cards.  It's really all about the theme -- fighting fires and saving lives.  It is a bummer when you loose though as it's all to easy to let the theme relate to the real world dangers of house fires.  We lost one game where victims kept turning up in the same bedroom.  My 12 year old, with sad eyes, remarked "must have been a slumber party"

Thumbs up from everyone on this one, can get a little fiddley when things really heat up but fun till the end!

Uh-oh, Pandemic, you're in big trouble.

If I want a solo/coop that's tactical and thinky, I'll play Silent War.

If I want a coop with my non-gamer family members, I'll play basic Flash Point.  If I want a quick coop to open/close a gaming session, I'll play advanced Flash Point.  

Not sure what itch Pandemic is the best at scratching anymore.

Also - goodbye, Forbidden Island.

RATING: 5
Flash Point has a great theme and is very friendly to new gamers, but as someone who has played quite a few games and co-ops, I find it falls flat. This is mostly due the random dice rolls that dictate how the fire spreads (the game's chief obstacle). More strategic co-op games tend to provide information about what might be coming up next. This one can't and the result is a wildly varying play experience: sometimes it's a walk in the park and sometimes it is near impossible, even on the same difficulty level.

For me, there are too many good co-op games (including the similar but more enjoyable Pandemic) to spend time on Flash Point.

A nice cooperative game with a strong firefighting theme.  Getting the fire under control is no guarantee, because you can think everything is just fine when suddenly fire sweeps through the building.  By the same token, a house seemingly filled with fire is not a guaranteed loss.

The biggest complaint I have is that the rulebook is not as clear as it could/should be, especially for players that jump to the "experienced" game right away.  The experienced game is not so complicated that a group of experienced gamers needs the training wheels of the basic game.  But the experienced rules are written as "just like the basic game, except...."  We have to constantly flip back and forth for, "What is the basic rule, what is the exception."  So setup is difficult and figuring out the ongoing gameplay is worse.  Since I don't play every day or every week, I don't remember all the rules between plays, nor do the (changing cast of) people I play with.  As a result, I'm not sure I've yet played with all the correct rules all at once.  There's still lots of "Wait, we forgot..." and "Oh yeah, we should have...."

Thematically this game really grabs me and I doubt that I would ever pass up a chance to play. I'd solo this frequently but it seems every time I bring it out one of my boys wants to play with me.
It could be subject to a dominant player but thankfully that's not something I need to worry about.

Very fun and thematic co-op game. I like this one more than Pandemic as a nice intro game for two reasons. First, the theme is a lot of fun, and anyone can get into it. We all like to feel like a hero! Secondly, the randomness of the fire popping up that so many people seem to decry really helps to eliminate the quarterbacking issue for new players. It's harder for the experienced players to tell everyone what to do when you can't tell what the best choice is.

I've never played the family game. I always jump people right into the special firefighters.

Very fiddly compared to even Pandemic. Not so much as in the number of components which there are a lot, but many different kinds of components to keep track of at one time.  A lot of rules you have to remember compared to Pandemic or Forbidden Island.  Don't understand how people say it's easier to learn than Pandemic...sheesh.

Theme is great.  It just hurts may head trying to manage this game.  My kids love it though.

There are some rules that don't make sense and are hard to remember like placing the POI marker in the "Experienced" game.  

I prefer Pandemic, Forbidden Island, and Castle Panic over this.

Initial Rating: 3.0 (April 2013)

VERY boring game, I wasn’t expecting a good game and I wasn’t disappointed :S. This is worse than Pandemic (another game I don´t like), I had zero fun playing this and I hope to never play it again. 

Now to my reasons. The theme doesn’t do anything for me (although I recognize it is a novel theme) so I don’t care about it one way or another. With 4 players I felt the down time to be excessive, I shudder to think how the game will play with 5 or more players. I tend to play quickly so I did and it took “decades” for my turn to come back. The decisions are obvious 99% of the time, it is completely random where the fire will spread, if you roll well you will win, if you roll poorly you will lose, lots of chaos, zero strategy.

I liked the variety of roles and the fact that you can change them in the game, however I feel they are unbalanced (for example The Driver). Playing with him you have to always do the same actions throughout all the game, very boring. The game components are very well done, it`s just that the gameplay sucks. 

Bottom line Flash Point can be fun to some people, but not for me. I will do my best to stay away from this game. If I want to play a Co Op game, I would play Space Alert, Hanabi, Sentinels for the Multiverse or Arkham Horror over this one.

As a cooperative game, Flash Point is better than vanilla Pandemic. However, similar to the world-wide disease-busting puzzle-game, you will play the harder difficulty levels to really challenge yourself and your friends. The theme is excellent too, as you find yourself fighting fires, rescuing kitty cats, and getting blown out of the house by gas explosions. Shout fire for a thematic bonus.

Co-op game with (as many have noted) similarites to Pandemic.

The players have special powers that need to be exploited to give the best chance of success, and the players have to divide their resources between doing what's required to win and what's required to prevent the game from defeating them. It doesn't always work out!

As a Firefighter I love seeing a pretty cool simulation come out. It's far from perfect but at least it's SOMETHING! I would quibble about each player being an all in one Firefighter as Pumpermen don't carry axes, they carry and lighten-up the hose. Laddermen carry ventilation tools and this part is totally left out of the game and it's vitally important in a real fire. The Ladder Pipe wouldn't be used until the building was lost so that's off too. Last but not least the "Rescue Specialist" is a lady with makeup on!!! She should have been on the "Imaging Tech" card.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of my go-to gateway games. I have used it to introduce many people to the world of nerdy gaming and they always want to play again. Heck, even my wife -- who is not a gamer -- has introduced this to new players of her own volition in my absence! There's something in the premise of being a team of firefighters that people latch onto easily. I love how quickly they get emotionally attached to each of the victims (faceless, generic, slightly people-shaped pictures on blue tokens) so that it comes off as genuinely sad if anyone is killed.

Positives: Very simple mechanics. My 4-year-old daughter can happily play the family game! Anyone can be comfortable with their options on their turn within 15 minutes of starting. Strategy, on the other hand, comes with experience. You only need to play the family game once to be able to play with the far superior and not much more complicated advanced rules. It gets genuinely tense and there's a real sense of urgency once the fire starts to spread near PoIs.

Negatives: As with all co-ops, it can be very easy for one player to dominate the others' turns. Waiting between turns can drag on a bit, especially if you're playing with more than 4, a couple of new players, or someone who suffers from AP. The fire engine is useless without the crew chief and only works haphazardly with him.

2014-10-11 - I like this cooperative game a lot. I can see why it gets compared to Pandemic, because the fire spreading and explosion mechanism is a little like the pandemic infection deck, except with dice. That similarity aside, though, the game feels a good bit different, in part, I think, because it's a much more localized, personal subject. I've only played the basic game a couple of times. I'm excited to try it with special roles.

I am not generally a big co-op fan, although I do enjoy Pandemic. This game is not as compelling as that one, probably because of the higher degree of randomness in the game system, however this is still enjoyable. I do agree with those that say the role-switching needs to be leveraged to win, but the downside of constantly switching roles is that it is harder to feel connected to your individual role in the action. You play a collective, which for me is a little less enticing.

Why not play Pandemic instead... this is not different enough. I cannot give this game a rating higher than I give Pandemic because it has the same weakness: the game can be reduced to solitaire play. There is no point playing this game with more than 1 player as they contribute nothing to the game play mechanics. A good coop game needs something that truly requires teamwork: traitor role, real-time or hidden information. This game has none of them, just like Pandemic. The whole "pure coop" genre is flawed and much less interesting than other coop genres. If you like that kind of games, you may want to check this out. Otherwise, this brings nothing new to the table.

This game does feel a bit like Pandemic for firefighting. Along those lines, it amps up the speed of the game. I truly prefer rolling the dice here to drawing cards in Pandemic. I do admit that each mechanic helps the theme for each game. I like the ability to choose and change your abilities. I bought this game new from White Dragon, and it ended up being the first edition. The pieces aren't that great, and the manuals are double size to fit in the German. Aside from that complaint, I'm really happy with this game.

I'd want to play it again, but it strikes me as a nice variant on Pandemic. I like the theme better, and I feel like the game is working against me less. To clarify, in Pandamic, the deck is very limited and it's easy to loose because the deck runs out, and there's no way to stop it. In Flash Point, there are also timing mechanism (e.g. damage to house), but choices can be made which prolong or shorten the timing. 

I also like being able to fully see the board situation in Flash Point (as opposed to Pandemic which heavily encourages remembering which cities are in play / have been played). The games are very similar, but I like the sense of control/direction that Flash Point offers, even if the house is burning down around you.

Probably the second or third game I bought, a great interaction co-op that everyone gets involved in. Even my Nan played and I think enjoyed it. Theme works well and no two games are ever the same. Still one of my favourites. Sadly haven't played enough to feel the need for expansions yet.

Nice, cooperative family game but we did not enjoy it more than Pandemic.  So it is not an essential for us.

RATING: 3
The more I play this game, the less I enjoy it.

Worst Quarterbacking in any game yet. What makes that even worse is that the decisions almost always seem very obvious. Especially in the advanced game.

There aren't difficult choices, there are streamlined choices. Sometimes your choice is highlighted in fire.

I don't understand the widespread appeal of this game. Every time I hope I learn a rule that changes it for me. But it's a very average experience for me.

Probably my favourite co-op...even edging out pandemic....though you need to play with the more advanced options. Family version is fine for the first couple of plays to get the mechanics down... but later you'll want haz-mats, flash-overs, hot spots, the fire engine...etc. So good, I thought Matt Leacock had designed it. (That is a compliment Mr. Lanzing!)

Fun coop, more to follow...

After having stood on the shelf for a whole year, I finally brought this to the table for my Thursday night gaming group, who loved it! Me too! We only played the basic/family version, but next time we play the full game. Have the 2nd story expansion to throw in for more fun and variation...

A simple but thematic game about being a firefighter. Similar to Pandemic except that instead of randomising locations with a deck of cards, you pick locations with 2 dice.

A stereotypical kinda of co-op game. There's nothing particularly new or fresh about the design. Just the theme if you like it.

A good game. It seems that it is easier than Pandemic. However, we have tried only the introductory game, so it is still hard to tell. I enjoyed that in this game you can save unused actions. I don't know how this fits thematically, but from the game perspectives it eases things a lot.

Geras žaidimas. Lyg ir lengvesnis, negu Pandemic. Kita vertus, mes tik įžanginę jo versiją spėjome sužaisti, tai dar sunku pasakyti. Man patiko tai, kad čia neišnaudotus veiksmus gali išsisaugoti. Nežinau, kaip tai atsispindi tematiškai, bet žaidimo prasme tai labai palengvina gyvenimą.

5/27/2014: Easily my most played game right now. I suspected I would like it, but it is one that I am playing a ton right now.

5/27/2016: Slowed down from playing this one but still one of my favorites. Its a bit more casual than a lot of my other favorites, but can be challenging. I love the randomness that the game offers where in one turn you go from a few spotted flames around the house to blazing inferno a couple turns later. Looking forward to more expansions (hopefully), the variety of all the different maps makes this game that much more re playable.

A very thematic game that makes it quite addicting to play. There's a true sense of emergency and urgency while fires spread and victims are still in the house. Roles and responsibilities are well balanced so that each player is involved in the rescue. It's an easy game to pick up and learn and with the varying levels of difficulty, it's a game that works for new players or veteran players.

RATING: 9
An incredible game, with varying levels of complexity and difficulty.  It's a lot like Pandemic, except that for me, the global disease theme in Pandemic is too big, and that makes it seem more distant and less aligned with the cooperative mechanic.  By contrast, the setting and mission in Fire Rescue are far more intimate - a single dwelling, with people trapped inside.  It gives the game more emotional punch.  If you like cooperative games, this is a must-own.

Now, that being said, I've seen games play out really differently based on dice rolls.  Some games have been a breeze, the fire under control, and the people and even small animals quickly moved to safety.  Other games have been overwhelming hellfire pits from which no firefighter was ever going to emerge alive.  And other games seem to be going well until a few poor decisions combine with a few unlucky dice rolls and the building collapses on your head.  Some folks might find this to be too random, but it works just fine for me.

Fun co-operative game with an engaging theme.  If one likes co-operative games then this is a really good choice.  But as far as co-op's are concerned, I prefer Pandemic and one reason is that the method of escalation is cleaner and easier to understand in Pandemic.  Still it's a good game.

Great attention to detail is both a strength and weakness. At times, feels slow and overly complex. You want to do more than you can in a turn. Better with lower player count.

Eh -- played a solo match on veteran (w/ 2 firefighters) and it really didn't blow me away.  I definitely got the sense of urgency, but managed to save 8 out of 10 POIs without really breaking a sweat. I probably had some dice luck as I never was in any real danger until the very last victim.  Wouldn't be my go to co-op game, but if I wanted a light co-op with a quick set up time I'd grab FP.  But this definitely wont top Pandemic as the co-op of choice [with OTB expansion of course]

Like many completely co-op games where you're fighting the environment: felt mechanical.  We won with a minimum of panic, and from talking to the guys who own it, he said that panic was generally a short jump to death, while no panic was generally a cake walk.

I wished this game is more better designed, I really do. However, there are just some games where it is too easy, some where it is just impossible, and some games where the tension is just perfect... the third type of game is the one that earns this a 8. 

Perhaps some house rule can be used to keep the tension living, had tested some, made the game too frustrating and stressful for my liking. Have another in mind to be playtested

Pandemic...with fire! Aside from the direct comparison I think I actually enjoy this one slightly more than Pandemic just because it has more variance and is more enjoyable. Games that can be solved aren't as exciting as those that must be dealt with. This game demands that you deal with its variance and randomness. Multiple roles increase playability and the ambulance and fire truck movements outside add for increased excitement and strategy. Definitely willing to play this one again.

Played the hell out of the game the first night it was introduced, sadly that very much dulled down the entertainment value of the game as it offers little challenge and the game almost never turns the tide of battle once the fire is under control.

A good co-op with several innovations. First the fire spreads completely at random, making things all the more frantic (contrast with Pandemic where oubreaks tend to happen in places where they've already occurred).

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue. In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.
 As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building. Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles. If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose. Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.

pandemic clone with an even more boring theme. coop game where more-experienced or assertive players tell others what to do or what the "optimal" thing for them to do on their turn. A simple puzzle game at best, a game of jack-in-the-box at worst.

puzzle game: there is 1 optimal way to play and no room for creativity.
luck game: dice rolls largely determine success/failure/difficulty of the game

False co-op game. Single player game masquerading as co-op.

This game is probably the best thematic Co-op that I have seen. The spread of the fire is realistic and you definitely feel a sense of urgency trying to rescue the victims. Has the potential to rise to a 10 for me.

I've enjoyed this game as another alternative to Pandemic.  The theme works very well and adds to the flavor of the game.  All my plays jumped to advanced play immediately.  The different boards from the expansion provide for some different dynamics in game play, particularly the skyscraper which can prove much more difficult to "solve".  Much like Pandemic in that you increase the difficulty by adding more fires at the beginning.  Game only has one way to win (rescuing 7 people/pets) but a couple ways to lose (structure falls down or too many people/pets die).  Like most coop games, this one is susceptible to one person tells everyone else what to do...

Over the years I have come to appreciate cooperative games more and more. I enjoy them for the team building, the puzzle solving, and the overall different experience they treat their players with than a competitive game does. Flash Point is a decent entry into this world offering the players a theme that is almost tailored made for the genre, fighting fires in various locations. Each player plays as a different type of firefighter with different abilities that will help them and hinder them throughout the game. In another perfect match the fire spreads in completely random ways through the roll of a dice. The mechanics are pretty solid throughout the game. The player abilities make each character feel unique, although that does tend to lock each player into doing one specific thing during a fire (but I am guessing that is pretty thematic anyway). What I really had an object too was that this, even more so than most cooperative games, didn't really offer very meaningful choices. it was pretty obvious what you should do on a turn and if you deviated from that the whole group definitely suffered quite a bit. I didn't feel like I had anything I could do other than what I was expected to do. The game can be quite tense and that is a lot of fun, and it is most definitely a challenge, but overall I am glad i played someone else's copy and didn't buy this myself. I much prefer other co-op games.

I played The Resistance game but I am not sure whether the game is the right kind of game to me.  Many other people do like the game in our group.  This is another game from the same publisher where every man would have imagined when he is still a kid - becoming a firefighter. Multiplayers game in that players win the game as a team, while scoring points by themselves.  There should be a lot of talk during the game as each one is trying to do the best for the team to beat the system - the "fire spread".  As the game designer said, the game would be perfectly suitable for family leisure time.  I am considering buying it but in the meantime, I am wondering do the actual firemen have the time to talk in a fire situation?  Anyway, the game is interesting in its first appeal.

A fun, approachable cooperative game with a fairly smooth learning curve - only the finer points of explosions need a little practice to get down. Great at creating suspense about whether the team will win.  Appears to add quite a bit of replay value with more advanced play.

RATING: 7
I was eager to try this as I think the theme is very appealing. However, co-op games don't get much table time with my regular groups. It's a very appealing game, tense and exciting (though a lot of the fire-spreading rules were vague to us). It reminds me a lot of Pandemic, and that's sort of the problem. I already have Pandemic, and I like Pandemic and Pandemic doesn't get much play. So as much as I'd like to support games with fresh themes and attractive delivery, I don't see much need to have another game that's just not going to get any play.

I've been a big fan of [thing=30549][/thing], so when I saw [thing=100901][/thing] I was pretty interested.  We had missed the Kickstarter campaign, but we ended up preordering the game.

The components are very nice and the gameplay feels intuitive and fluid.  The game is a little more random than Pandemic, but I found that this fit the theme better and actually made the game more tense---you never know where a blaze is going to go up.  Plus, I think the random nature makes the game less deterministic and less prone to easy decisions and one player dictating everyone's actions.  Each role is significantly more different from each other than in Pandemic, which fits the teamplay better.  The game also felt more personal, bringing the threat from the global scale of Pandemic to the family scale.  It even has a dog and cat that you can rescue!

On the other hand, my wife wasn't a huge fan of this with just two.  I do think that most cooperative games work better with more people, as you get more a team play aspect to it.  Still, this is much better to solo play than Pandemic, so I've gotten several plays in with just myself.

My favorite coop, as of this writing.  Has a large amount of theme compared to other coops.  And this is the only game that I have ever played where, after the game has been won, people want to keep playing it anyways...because we have to rescue these totally real people from the burning building!

I like the player powers.  They really do differentiate what the players can do.  And I like that you're not even locked in to keep your character if you figure it the situation really calls for a different one.

I like the easy version compared to the advanced version.  It's just a lot easier to teach and get people into it.  And I still enjoy the easy version quite a bit.  

The only problem with the game is the randomness.  Based on where the fires come out the game could be a lot harder or a lot easier.  How far do you have to go to get to the fires?  How many explosions are there?  Does it keep building up in an area and knock out a bunch of walls?  Does the fire happen to land next to a victim?

Fortunately, the advanced version helps you mitigate a lot of the unlucky things because of the player powers and the firetruck.  If one place gets out of hand with fire you can address that better than in the simple version.  So I think that really helps.  And furthermore, the randomness doesn't bother me because that feels realistic, and what this game does so well is making you feel engaged with a realistic theme.

The only thing that's not so thematic is the way that new points of interest pop up.  You could rescue six people from the same small room.  Really?  You somehow didn't see them the first four times you were in the room?  But we get over that pretty easily.

I love this game because it feels like you are doing something that matters in real life.  That is markedly absent from most games.  It's just a fresh idea.

Furthermore, quarterbacking doesn't seem to be much of a problem with this one.  Not that you couldn't, but, there are usually options.  It's pretty easy to, as the experienced player, lay out some options, and show the pros and cons of both, while emphasizing the cons of the worst option, and let the person decide. 

Which brings me to my next point: meaningful decisions.  The game usually gives you a meaningful decision every turn.  Maybe multiple.  And because the turns are so fast, and the fire is constantly developing, player engagement is high.

I really like the components.  Love the black cubes.  It was very good that they made it a double-sided board.  I hope I can buy more boards for it eventually.  The only downside I can see really is that some people will be annoyed at the really small "hot spot" tokens.

Really glad they used miniatures for the player tokens.  Really glad they didn't make the box oversized.  There are a lot of tokens; I put a small plano box in there to hold them, which majorly helps speed up setup/tear-down.

Overall I don't have any major complaints.  Maybe if I play it a bunch more and decide it is too random after all that could lower it, but I think that probably won't happen.

Love it!

A very engaging Co-op game, in the same vein as Pandemic. Like Pandemic the play can become more of an engineering effort with a lot of discussion of the next moves taking place - but this suits me.

A couple of problems in the design though: 
The Driver/Operator isn't a very interesting role to play, but crucial to the effort, so our house rule is to always have him along, as a shared role.

Difficulty scales well with the number of players, but the difference between difficulty levels not so much. We have found it flat out impossible to beat the highest difficulty level

It's an excellent "Pandemic-stile co-op game." It's very thematic. Before my first game, I thought that the increased randomness of the dice - compared to Pandemic - would be a problem for me. But it feels very thematic. I always recommended Pandemic as the "gateway game" for others. I think now I will recommend Flash Point because I think it's better suited for new gamers.

verdict: better than expected - the new gateway co-op and it's expandable

If the way fires broke out worked in a similar fashion as the infection deck in Pandemic, I would like this game more than base game Pandemic, as having to save people by dragging them out of the burning building is a lot more thematic than curing a disease by discarding 5 cards of the same color. However, that the smoke/flames are added so randomly, with it potentially landing right next to you for easy removal or to burn down a person makes this game slightly less enjoyable to me.

Some other more minor pros and cons compared to Pandemic
Pros:
Ability to play up to 6
Double sided board and characters having pretty unique special abilities makes me think this has more base game replayability.

Cons:
Lack of cards make this game more simple and I would say less strategic than Pandemic

My initial rating was a 6, as this game simply didn't excite me like I expected it to. That ate at me, and drove me to keep trying for some reason; that and we hadn't actually won, so there HAD to be something more.

THERE IS MORE. My rating rose to a 7. So this isn't a wonderous original game, but it's a very good game that has some subtle signs you have to train yourself to observe. The role switching is certainly this game's unique contribution as you really MUST switch roles at some point otherwise you will fail.

There have been times of being seemingly way ahead and some crazy circumstances happening. It at first appeared luck, but then we recognized some signs and realized where we had gone wrong.

What does all this add up to? A game that's seriously growing on me and that I want to play more. It plays in 30-40 minutes, so that's a REAL plus for something is dynamic.

There are more complicated rules, which I have yet to try, since its too much to explain to the kids and my husband isn't too keen on the game. It's  a race against fire, which spreads pretty bloody quickly when it gets going. Random appearances of people to save can make the game easy or impossible...slight draw back, but seems pretty realistic to what real life fire fighting is about.

Seems a lot like pandemic BUT easier and more accessible.

The game seems to scale well regardless of the number of firefighters (i.e., 1 to 5). When playing solo, folks will oftentimes control multiple firemen (i.e., 2-4) so as to give some variety. There is role-changing that is allowed in the expert version.

One of the things that sucks about a lot of co-ops is that as individual player, you feel a bit helpless to impact the outcome of the game... winning comes by working together, which means you really have to share your thoughts and strategy and discuss them with other players. Flash Point does this too. There are lots of fiddly special-case rules, which are especially bad in co-ops since there is an advantage to overlooking them (and no incentive for other players to spot them). Play is lots of thinking and weighing of options, but very little actual action. Randomness and bad-luck feel like they have as much impact on the outcome as any actual strategy. Yuck.

Look, I get that there are people who love co-ops because they're non-confrontational, or because they can be played solo or with people who lack the will and/or capacity to learn the rules properly, and that's just great. Those sorts of people will probably get good use out of a game like Flash Point. For me, a co-op needs to be a bit more special. Putting out fires is a novel theme, but I much prefer exploring the world in Eldritch Horror.

I like the theme and the stylized look of this game, but the gameplay isn't that exciting. (10+ plays solitaire, 2-player & 3 players - which I haven't recorded all.)
I really want to like this game, but somehow I don't feel immersed.  Every time you save someone, another POI turns up. You go save that one and another POI turns up, you save that one and another one pops up and this goes on... Resolving an explosion is putting fire tokens there and there and some cubes on walls there and there...
I mentally can't get past the mechanics and that kills the game for me.

I've had some fun with this game, but I haven't found it to be particularly engaging. There are some problems with it in my opinion. The pace is slow. You often don't feel like you accomplish much of anything in your turn. It can be very difficult because with a couple of dice rolls that go against you, the house could be fubar without you being able to do a thing about it. This is common with coops and you can reduce the difficulty. When I play it, it feels mechanical. I like the theme and it works but it just seems like this game is missing something. It's not a bad game, but it is a game that could get cut from my collection at some point.

(Review after owning game for 4+ years):

For a game that is a board game version of playing with firetrucks and living out every childhood dream, it is fairly complicated and difficult to play. Gaming elements (rolling for fire, progressing fire, moving trucks) have just a bit too much abstraction so that they distract from the thematic elements of being a team of heroic firefighters. With the right group there are times of triumph with somewhat hysterical elements, such as being stuck in a burning bathroom while carrying the house cat. But these are few an far between. I haven't finished a game without the feeling of doing chores, so I wouldn't recommend this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game as well as Pandemic. I love cooperative games in general. I liked the simplicity of Pandemic, but in two expansions, it become more complex to play and teach, thus not ideal as a gateway game if you try to include everything. Flash Point offers expansions, but complexity is not as swift as with Pandemic. It's still there though. With Flash Point: I particularly like the idea of saving actions, because it seems very thematic not to rush into a fire just to use all of your action points. The opportunity to change roles midgame is inspired as well. I ordered expansions after our first play, but tried to stick with maps and characters over new and exciting (dangerous) rule additions. I think Flash Point may become our coop gateway of choice and we will be playing this with our grandson at the earliest opportunity. Excellent and highly recommended.

Gefällt mir ganz gut, das Spiel hat aber ein Problem, dass mit nach mehr Partien immer stärker auffällt: Die Partien können zu unterschiedlich verlaufen, was den Schwierigkeitsgrad betrifft. Wenn man "Glück" hat, fallen die Würfel so, dass es herausfordernd aber nicht unfair ist. Dann macht das Spiel wirklich Spaß und würde von mir sogar 8 Punkte erhalten. Es kann aber auch anders laufen...
Auf ein und der selben Schwierigkeit kann man chancenlos untergehen oder relativ problemlos gewinnen. Es kann sich ein fast erloschenes Feuer (also fast keine Feuer/Rauch-Marker mehr auf dem Brett) durch unglückliche Würfelwürfe innerhalb von 2-3 Spielerzügen in ein nicht kontrollierbares Flammendes Inferno (insofern passender Untertitel) verwandeln, wo man plötzlich, obwohl alles gut aussah, chancenlos verliert, so mehrmals bei meinen ca. 20 Partien passiert. Da man anders als z.B. in Pandemie oder die vergessene Stadt keinerlei Hinweis darauf hat, wo das Übel (hier in Form des Feuers) auftritt, so dass man aufgrund von statistischen Überlegungen abschätzen könnte, wo es wichtiger wäre zu handeln, wirkt dies nur frustrierend, weil man sich nichtmal denken kann "ah ja, dass hätten wir vielleicht so besser machen können", sondern einfach nur dasitzt und sich denkt: "Mhh, war bei dem Würfelpech halt nicht zu gewinnen, schade..."
Ich habe an und für sich überhaupt nichts gegen Glück in einem kooperativen Spiel, aber es sollte entweder einschätzbar sein oder ausgleichende Mechanismen geben, so dass Extreme nur sehr selten sind. Hier ist das Gegenteil der Fall: Wenn man Pech hat und viele Explosionen hintereinander würfelt, erhöht dies die Chance weitere Explosionen zu würfeln. Da man selber keinerlei Einfluss darauf hat diesen Teufelskreis zu durchbrechen (da man keine Möglichkeit hat abzuschätzen, wo es wichtiger ist das Feuer zu löschen), ist das Spiel in dieser Hinsicht unausgegoren.
Dadurch haben einige Partien einen sehr faden Beigeschmack und zeigen, dass es dem Spiel an einem Mechanismus fehlt, der die Schwierigkeit balanciert. Umgekehrt, wenn man was das Feuer betrifft Glück hat, kann man sich alle Zeit der Welt lassen die Leute einen nach dem andern aus dem Haus zu holen, während die anderen Spieler das aufkeimende Feuer in Schach halten. Da es keinen Timing-Mechanismus (wie z.B. in Pandemie, Die Zwerge oder Eldritch Horror) gibt, der einen zwingt in einer bestimmten Zeit fertig zu werden. Dies sorgt dann für relativ langweilige Partien, in denen nach der Anfangsphase nie echte Gefahr besteht.
Bisher waren für mein Gefühl etwas mehr als die Hälfte der Partien gut von der Balance, der Rest entweder zu einfach oder "ungewinnbar" aufgrund der Würfel. Eigentlich eine zu geringe Quote, trotzdem mag ich das Spiel mehr, als ich erklären kann, da es wie aufgeführt einige gravierende Mängel im Spieldesign besitzt, und gebe ihm dennoch 7 Punkte.

The call comes in, and moments later you don the protective suits that will keep you alive, gather your equipment and rush to the scene of a blazing inferno. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse, and lives are in danger.

A good amount of tension on the higher difficulty level.  Once players get a good grasp of the game, the table talk can drop off a bit since the decisions each turn can be fairly straight forward.  I've had a lot of success introducing this to new gamers so it'll stay in my collection.

Ok, I think the instructions could have been done better.  If you need clarification on a few things, watch a video, or read FAQ here.  It's worth it.  It's really not difficult - they just make it seem more complicated than it really is.

It's a very fun co-op.  Different enough from Pandemic to merit owning both in my opinion.  I really enjoyed it and look forward to more plays.

A good co-op for sure that uses its theme well. The theme is great. Gameplay can be somewhat slow because you have so few actions and it costs so much to do anything, so you can't ever really do much. Which maybe that simulates firefighting well, but still, it causes for a bit of a slogging time. But the game amps up and is overall fun. i would always play it.

So far I've played more solo games than anything else, and the game truly shines as a solo experience.

Great cooperative game which scales quite well for either family or more serious play. The theme is wonderful and respectfully done. The game has a very high replay value due to the variable fire movement and randomly placed hidden points of interest which need to be investigated. The specific roles provide incentive to cooperate and allow everyone to have a sense of purpose and participation.

Great thematic co-op, take on the role of a firefighter, enter a burning building, save lives!

Speaks to my younger self wanting to be a fireman.

RATING: 5
This is a beautifully produced, well-themed, carefully thought-out game that leaves me flat. It's close to Pandemic in so many ways that it's hard not to compare the two, and Flash Point lacks the spark of Pandemic for me. I don't see a compelling reason to own both.

With Pandemic, my very first game made me want to play again on the spot; that didn't happen with FP. It's a good game, but competing against a stable of co-ops that I love to play and rate more highly (Pandemic 10, Defenders of the Realm 9, Elder Sign 9, and Yggdrasil 8), it needed to bring something special to the table.

My group felt pretty much the same way: fun game, but less fun than alternatives we already have on hand. And I feel sort of bad about that -- FP really is an excellent game, and one that a lot of folks will enjoy a great deal.

After it went several months with no plays beyond the first, I sold it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid game that scale very well from 1 to 4 (maximum # of firefighters played so far).  Top quality components, simple and streamlined rules.  The fire spread by throwing dices, wich is very random, but no one can predict fire in real life either, so it's still thematic.

This game is good fun with gamers and non-gamers alike.

Started off good. Got kind of meh. Now it's climbing back up now that we play with all the roles and extra stuff. I now plan on buying a few expansions. The art in this game is just top notch. Very well done, without being too scary, so it remains a family game. It still has a few problems like being a bit too fiddly (ok, a LOT too fiddly), but that can probably be remedied by getting a good plano box to store all the little separate bits in. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the theme, or couples who enjoy playing co-ops together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
To summarize this game in a nutshell think of it like Pandemic but with firefighters.  The game is a lot of fun and it gets stressful when fires get out of hand.  A lot of the frustration also comes from reaching a point of interest that was far away only for it to end up being a false alarm.

Just like Pandemic we get sucked into the theme and imagine ourselves as firefighters.  It sucks when a victim dies from an explosion.

Not as good as Pandemic from a technical standpoint(see below), but more fun. As much as I avoid rating games I don't own above an 8, I have a hard time finding that much wrong with the game. Easily the second most enjoyable game experience at DaveCon 2012 for a game I don't own. Cosmic Encounter being first. People will complain about the random aspect of the fire, but hello, it's fire.

I wished the game board was somehow split into levels so people and animals you need to save were placed once and not added as you saved others. For such a thematic game, it's kind of frustrating to save somebody, and the next round somebody pops up next to them and you need to go back.

Played at DaveCon 2012

Originally I thought this game fired Pandemic. Unfortunately it was harder to get to the table and with our advanced groups other coops were more likely to see play. But I held onto this thinking there would be a day when it would get played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The beginner's rules are just to learn, go for the advanced rules to have serious fun.

The enemy is the fire, and it behaves quite randomly, which is consistent with the theme. Tension really builds up as the fire proceeds and accelerates, threatening the people and pets in the house with death.

Teamwork is essential to take advantage of the specialised skills of the firefighters. Actually, you'll end up feeling that the individuality of each player gets fuzzier and fuzzier until everybody discusses everybody else's moves.

Even with mostly cardboard parts, the aesthetics of the game is satisfactory and the fire spreading through dice cast with explosions and crumbling walls gives a creepy pleasure also in matches that end in a defeat.

My personal approval for making a game about heroism based on the value of life, work and co-operation. Enough with war, trade and deception!

what a great co-op game! always excited to get this to the table! my group enjoys it very much too. Who could resist being a firefighter, courageously charging inward to the blazing inferno to save kittens and people trapped inside?! A heroic feat indeed, who's up for the challenge? While searching for survivors, an explosion could knock you down. It's thrilling to be sitting in the hotspot!
I highly recommend this game.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a co-operative game in which players take on the roll of firefighters.  Each firefighter has unique skills that will need to be used to best advantage in order to fight back flames, seek out and eliminate hazardous materials, and locate and save residents of a burning house.

The pressure is on immediately as the fire spreads unpredictably.  It's not easy finding the people inside either.  Sometimes when you suspect there's someone in a room you find out the intelligence is faulty when you get there.  If you can save at least 7 people before the flames, and explosions, kill them, or destroy the house, then players win!  Good luck.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a fun game that is just soaked with theme.  It draws players in immediately.  Right from the beginning you're thinking about how you're going to get the fire under control, quickly get in, grab the people inside, and get out.

If you like co-ops, intense game play, or just well done games, then I highly recommend this one!

This is a great co-op game. The rules are a little fiddly for complete non-gamers to pick up without a gamer to help them through it (those hot spots, flash overs and explosions are not so well explained). It's more complex than Forbidden Island, but less gamerly than Pandemic. The replayability comes from the random location of the PoIs and the randomness of the fire spreading mechanism, but that doesn't seem to matter. Now that there are two (soon to be three) expansions, each providing a different set of rooms to work in, there is a lot to explore. Added to that there are difficulty levels (the higher levels are HARD). Lots of fun in the light/short game category

I was very excited when I bought this. Then I played 3 or 4 games and got a bit bored with it. It's fun, but gets repetitive fairly quickly. The threat is always the same. Playing in different difficulty levels only makes it more difficult, while not making you need to do different things. Luck plays a big part in it, since every turn you are adding smoke or fire to the house based on a dice roll. The expansions probably add longevity to it, but I haven't tried them.

Flash Point or D-Day Dice?

Everyone seems to compare this game to Pandemic. I get why - both have increasing dangers to be controlled and both are co-ops. But Pandemic sucks. No seriously, it does, you just haven’t noticed. 

A more interesting comparison is to D-Day Dice. The goal is different (movement vs control) but both are co-ops, and fun. Also, both are similar in board design and components. Both are also a little easy (DDD broken with Lieutenant, see threads there). More important, both offer a wide variety of scenarios and replayability. But to that, it seems DDD gives you more bang for your buck. 

Also, FP seems a little more random. Not only because there are dice (I like dice btw), but because that drives where things show up. DDD is more linear there. So I guess it’s interesting to go in, knock down some walls, save a couple people, go out – then rinse and repeat. But either it’s easy because you have a path, or it’s frustrating because it’s too random. I think some of the expansions help here though, but there you have to pay more to get to that. 

I’m certainly glad for the Kickstarter success for FP, but I’m underwhelmed since it’s still just a solo game. All co-ops are solo. Even if you work around the Dominant Personality Problem, you are still inherently left with 2 problems: the DP *wants* to tell the “idiot” what to do and so is frustrated; the “idiot” knows they’re the idiot, and so the game isn’t as fun.  All good for a learning game I suppose, but after that?

At least neither DDD or FP suffer the Arkham Horror travesty of lasting 3+ hours (or 30 min if you die early). Minor point: Space Alert is actually playable solo with multiple “players” and increasing difficulty as there is enough time to map out all the ladder logic required to win. However, it is actually fun with a group since people will react differently and the time pressure is there. Perhaps AH would benefit from a timer?

If you can get it for cheap, or like solo games, it is well done – go for it.

Housewarming gift from a very punny friend.  This has a nice theme and is intuitive to teach and play.

It's a well made game. My first co-op game, which got me more into co-op. The game is well thought and the theme is different. One thing i found cool was when you damage to many walls, that game will end and you are unsuccessful as the structure will collapse.

Didn't kickstart because it just isn't a theme that excites me, though playing it was fun and I do see the appeal (our 6 player advanced game, came down to the wire - one cube away from a collapsing structure while getting the last two people out ftw.. Like it enough to play (again), but not enough to likely ever go out and buy.

After a couple of solo games, a 2-player session and a 6-player session:

The game feels good and thematically right. And looks good too. I enjoy it more than Pandemic.

Scalabiltiy: It's a lot harder with only 2 firefighters than with 6. So next time I'll play with more than 4 people I'll start at the intermediate level. Or play on the harder looking side of the board.

Good game, but for some reason it just isn't tickling me in the right spot. Maybe it's because it's too similar to Pandemic or maybe because it just feels like there's a little something missing. I'd like to try it with expansions some day.

This was my first Kickstarter game and I've been very pleased.  I am a big Pandemic fan so I had a feeling this would be a nice addition.  They are very similar games, but there are certainly enough differences to warrant playing and enjoying both.  Forced to make a choice I would probably lean slightly toward Pandemic, but Flash Point is a definite keeper.

A fun game that's co-op and I like better then Pandemic because it scales better and gives you more options with your character and with what you can do. Love the frantic feeling when half the building is on fire and you don't know what to do. Save people or stop the building from burning to the ground!

Plays 9 on added the 2nd Story expansion and Veteran and Rescue Dog characters.

Plays 12 on added Dangerous Waters

Also printed out a copy of the Structural Engineer since I have his mini to use with the game

Plays 14 on added Extreme Danger

Plays 22 on added Honor and Duty

Plays 32 on added Urban Structures

RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: Co-op game of saving people from a burning building.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Great theme that is very apparent through the game. You almost start to feel warmer upon entering a room full of fire. The game can be scaled both in difficulty and complexity making it easy to play with a range of temperaments and abilities.

Cons: It doesn't break the mold of cooperative games where it feels like a group optimization puzzle and suffers from all the usual pitfalls because of it. No one wants a "bossy" player, but it's not fair that the bossy player should feel like they need to disengage in order to hold back.

Other: I played as a convention demo and was taught by a very tired demoer. We started playing MANY things wrong, and tried to right the ship as we went along. Things definitely improved as we went, but I need to admit that there's a good chance we still haven't got a proper full game experience (though I'm comfortable with the comments I've made thus far).

Best Use: Has that go-to quality for an introductory cooperative game.

Terrific co-op.  It's lighter than Pandemic and less puzzle-y while being much more random, but importantly, not too random.

This is probably the co-operative game that families and non-gamers should own.  The theme is terrific and really comes through.  I bought into the system way more than I should have, and should play it more, but it's just a bit lighter than I'd generally prefer.  However, it's one that is always a winner when it gets to the table.

It's just a solid game, nothing flashy or spectacular about it. It's easy to learn and teach, fun to play a few times, accessible to kids and non-gamers and has an interesting theme.

I can't imagine playing this 50 times or even 20 times. But it's certainly worth 10-15 plays and is a good value for the money.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Despite running into some complications with misunderstood rules (and consequently thought at the time that the game was much more difficult than it actually is), this is an excellent game! Only played with the family rules so far, so we haven't yet seen everything this game has to offer. Definitely one of the best releases of 2011 in my opinion, and well worth the wait. With any luck the harder difficulties will present a healthy challenge.

I'm also quite pleased that this offers a considerably different experience to Pandemic. Not to say I dislike Pandemic (in fact, I love it), but if this game managed to outshine Pandemic with similar, superior gameplay, Pandemic would undoubtedly remain permanently shelved, and thus a waste of money.

However, while Pandemic offers more in strategy, Flash Point: Fire Rescue excels in its tactical gameplay. With Pandemic, it is possible to plan ahead: as players can gain a general understanding of what is to come, and therefore plan in advance to tackle the issues. With Flash Point: Fire Rescue, the chaotic nature of the fire means that long term strategies, while possible, can fall to pieces. Thus, it is best to assess the immediate and short-term future and work tactically, rather than working out a master plan. 

Thematically, the strategic nature of Pandemic and the tactical nature of Flash Point are perfect for their respective titles. Flash Point contains exciting gameplay, and the fire in this game never feels like a puzzle to solve (a quirk frequently mentioned of Pandemic) as it's random, fluid nature and the way it interacts with the deteriorating building structure means a player can never truly "solve" this game.

Ultimately, this game deserves the backing it received on Kickstarter, and deserves the praise it garners. If you're wondering whether Pandemic or Flash Point is the better title to buy, however, my answer is that you should definitely buy both. Flash Point contains rules that have clearly derived from Pandemic, but is certainly not a Pandemic clone; and both offer a truly unique, enjoyable game experience. If you enjoy one of these titles however do not own the other, definitely do yourself a favour and grab a copy of the other. You'd be hard pressed not to enjoy them both.

A good co-op, lots of expansions...but we were never interested enough to even try out the more advanced rules.  Might be due to the theme - as volunteers for the Red Cross, we come across victims of house fires too often for it to be a fun theme to play with.

Thanks Stefan!  Pretty exciting cooperative game.  Played the family version and we won by saving 8 people/animals.  Quite some tension.  One of the best settings for a cooperative.  Looking forward to trying all sorts of different setups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the theme. I like the tension. But the game gets very repetitive for me. Extinguish fire. It flares up. Extinguish it again. It flares up again. Pick up a victim. Oops, false alarm. Go back and extinguish smoke. Move to new victim. Smoke flares up. Smoke explodes. Use the truck. Extinguish. It explodes again. Use the truck again. Move to victim. Smoke again. Get victim, move a spot. Douse the smoke. Move a spot. 

In all of these situations, are you rolling dice between each turn, often times multiple times. To win, you need 7 victims rescued. This can easily take 90 minutes or more, which is too long for the gameplay offered.

I really like this theme. I want it to be cleaned up, and create a 30 minute hair-raising, pulse-pounding, scenario that leaves you wanting more.

[u]16-Jan-2013[/u]:  This is an excellent family/cooperative game where you take on the roles of firefighters trying to rescue people from a burning building.  The theme is the big draw with this one.  You really get the sense of rushing into danger and trying to get potential victims out of harm's way.

I had to bring up a comparison to Pandemic, but everyone seems to so...this is similar to that game in terms of the different roles, the cooperative play, and the intensity.  However, Flashpoint is much more random than Pandemic.  You use two dice to determine what the fire (the enemy) will do during the game.  Sometimes it's just a little smoke, sometimes it turns into a series of explosions creating havoc.  But this is also where the fun comes in.  You just never know what the flames will do from turn to turn.

I picked up the two expansions as well as I like variety in my games.  All together there are six different locations, some of them adding in new mechanisms and even one new role.  If you enjoy this game, these are an easy buy in my opinion.  I'm still learning the new maps, but again, the variety is awesome.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  We have really had a lot of fun with this one over the past year.  It's my youngest daughter's favorite game, perhaps?  Definitely up there in her top 3.  I recently rediscovered the fun with playing this one solo since this one actually sees the table with another player.  With all of the expansions the variability and options are fantastic.  The game is very thematic and a story really plays out in front of you.  Looking forward to even more plays of this one in the future.

You're a fireman. You must save people and pets from a burning House, risking your life. The most you save before the Building collapses, the best chance to get points!
You, fireman, must help one another. And if you think the game is becoming easier each time you play it, then you can go one step beyond by entering new rules and/or specialist firemans (or firewomen...) that will help you in the harder situations.

I haven't played this much and the games I've played (aside from solo, weirdly), have been anticlimactic. The score is based off my experiences. However, I believe there is a lot of excitement in this box and once I've broken this out more, it will change.

*edit Sept 9, 2012* Upset, but I had to let this go. My group did not enjoy it the two times I broke it out for them. I did, I think it's a great game. But seeing as it wasn't going to hit the table (and there are others I'd rather play over this), it's gone.

Excellent game - Good fun.

I don't think it's a Pandemic killer and I still prefer pandemics AI mechanic.

Best w/4, 2-6:

Including: 2nd Story, Extreme Danger, and Honor & Duty

If Pandemic is Co-Op gameplay stripped down to simple elegance, then this game is its Thematic cousin.  I enjoy Flashpoint very much, the game never fails to tell a story and offer risks and rewards.  I actually like this better than Pandemic because the fire directly affects the players, while the disease in Pandemic only effects the win / loss state. Warning - buy an expansion or too, and you'll be investing in a plano to organize the dozen or so game pieces and counters.

This game is one of the best I own, in terms of suitability for beginners AND for more advanced players. The intro game with preset locations and simplified rules = consistently takes skeptical non-gamers on a journey they love. The full rules are even more challenging because of the way the fire spreads.

Solid game, very high replay value.

Much to my surprise, I think this made Pandemic obsolete for me. It has obvious similarities (both are cooperative games where players choose a role then spend action points each turn, something bad happens at the end of each turn). 

Each has some randomness (dice in Flash Point, card distribution in Pandemic). A big difference (apart from theme) is that in Pandemic, players are trying to collect and trade sets of cards while in Flash Point players are trying to rescue victims. I find the latter much more straight-forward and fun.

I'm surprised that I like this one so much, but I logged 13 plays in the first week I owned it. The variety in maps is just extra goodness.

I don't mind the randomness of the fire at all, it actually makes it feel more thematic. The game lends itself well to a little story telling and is hilarious when someone gets a run of bad rolls and has to re-spawn out of the house. Really benefits from having little firemen figures.

It's a co-op, so it's meh (which is more my personal thing about co-ops - my argument is that they're not really games, just complex, cooperatively solved puzzles.)

And at least with the ruleset we played, it was not even particularly challenging or deep. I could see this game being a hit with families, kids or non-gamers, but it just didn't have enough to it to be meaningful or engaging to me. If I am going to spend my time gaming, I'd rather play something crunchy.

I like this co-op a lot.  I've always been a huge fan of Pandemic, but Flash Point continues to win me over.  The theme jumps out a bit more for me hear, and the little added complexity works well.  I'm unlikely to turn down a game of Pandemic, but my goto Co-op game is now Flash Point.

Very thematic co-op game with a similar action point system as Pandemic. It plays very fast too: our first time, it took only 1 hour to explain the rules including playing the game twice for the first time! It has more luck than Pandemic but it fits the theme. Very nice! 6 player base game is very dull though... avoid to play with too many players at any cost

Pandemic where the "outbreaks" are determined by dice rather than cards.  The base game is great, the expansion add more but mostly for avid fans.  They aren't necessary and do tend to bloat the game. 

Though most games are good, the dice sometimes result in a very easy experience or an exceedingly difficult one.  Less granularity in managing difficulty.

RATING: 8
Naturally Flash Point compares closely to Pandemic, which is one my favorite cooperative games.  I like that Flash Point supports up to 6 players, allows action points to be carried over to future turns, and provides quite a variety of roles.

Where Pandemic outshines Flash Point is the manner in which the crisis grows.  In Pandemic, the reshuffling of the infection discards creates a somewhat predictable pattern to where the epidemics are most likely to occur.  This gives players the opportunity to strategize and plan how best to attack the most volatile areas.

In Flash Point, the roll of the dice basically means any point on the board is equally likely to be targeted.  Your team can still focus on rescuing victims and extinguishing fires, but your order of approach is more of a guess than based on how you think the fires will spread.  Winning and losing may be more a function of the dice rolls than anything else.  But playing Flash Point is still a fun activity.

Flash Point is a fine example of a cooperative game. Flames spread randomly (using a die roll) like diseases do in Pandemic, and are compounded when one hits another, causing all sorts of damage. Players get to pick from different types of firefighters, all with special abilities, and battle the blaze, trying to save trapped civilians. One of the few co-op's I enjoy.

Great coop suitable for all ages.  Well implemented theme. Provides a very fun and tense gaming experience.  The random way in which the fire spreads means no two games are alike.  For those who like Forbidden Island, this is an excellent step-up.

RATING: 8
Ccop game with a relatively unique theme. I have played a lot games (1000s) and quite a few cooperative games (e.g., Shadows Over Camelot, Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Lord of the Rings, Castle Panic, Defenders of the Realm, Panic Station, etc.) and this is the best of 2011 and most likely in the Top 10 of cooperative games all time.  You are a firefighter.  Come on, who has not dreamed of being a firefighter?  Better yet, there is minimal chance of getting burned (unless you smoke or take the game to a different realism level) while you play.  Who could ask for more?  Game play is relatively simple and the spread of the fire is a great tension mechanism.  You have a several tactical choices (e.g., chop walls, move toward victims, etc.) and strategic decisions (e.g., fight fires or rescue victims).  In the advanced game (don't be scared by the word advanced, as it is still a relatively easy and straightforward game), your firefighters have special abilities and force you to work more cohesively as a team.  All in all, if you like the theme, or coops, or just want some new and different--then you should try Flash Point.

RATING: 8
[i]Flash Point[/i] reminds me just a little of [i]Pandemic[/i] in that its a coop-action board-management game, but its emphasis on getting people out rather then concentrating on the fire makes it much more focused and exciting, with a little extra randomness really heating things up.

Advanced mode is the way to go, and I think if you are playing the 'family'/basic mode you're basically only playing half a game.

It's quick (usually about 45 minutes to an hour per session) and although it's core rules system is quite light there's lots of depth to the game play. Although the base game only includes two static boards every game is very different.

The way fire acts, the way you can switch character roles as the situation changes (and in fact most of the elements of the game) are very well realised, and the game just feels very dynamic and intuitive. The major thing to take from this is its really fun!

Its very satisfying to play, feeling light and breezy whilst also being tactical and strategic.

Probably the only gripe I have is that some roles are not as effective as others meaning they tend to not get taken very often. Perhaps expansion boards will help these less essential roles find their place. Also there's no action tokens for the various roles despite several having specialised actions. This was fixed in the 2nd Story expansion but why they didn't have them in to start with is a mystery.

Talking of which the game is also well supported with several expansions adding all the depth and variation you could want onto to an already well greased and efficient system. Extra boards and more complicated rules add multiple floors to buildings, and introduce fire fighting in a warehouse, office block, subway station, aeroplane, and even ship and submarine!

More plays still might change my opinion yet but at this point its well on its way to becoming one of my all time favourite coops!

This game is fast and with so little downtime between turns it flows really well.

One of the best Pandemic-style co-ops out there. There's so much content at this point that you'd think this game would have unlimited replay value. Unfortunately, that wasn't really the case.

Cooperative game. One of the first games we've played and we found it difficult to win because once the fire took hold it was difficult to control.

RATING: 3
I've wanted to like it so much and I've given it many chances, but FPFR just fails to capture how fun it sounds. The random fire rolls should prevent the alpha gamer planification issue common to most cooperative games - and perhaps they do to some extent - but unfortunately that effort is countered by most of the characters being dull and obvious. The extremely useful character powers generally make you focus exclusively on them, either because they're so powerful it would be waste to do anything else (right Mr. Truckdriver) or because they come bundled with an extremely limiting downside (your medic will almost never put out any fire). Then it's just an exercise in spending action points efficiently. I suspect the game is about character swapping rather than interesting characters, but at 4+ players you have all your angles covered and have no need to change them. (Aside from one player who just sits in a vehicle all day long, switching between the "scan POI" one and the "move other characters" one.) You will likely destroy the first levels of difficulty and harder ones just scale the fire up but don't force you to revise your strategy.

So I started buying expansions because trickier situations and variants would spice up the thing for sure, but they were in the vein of "how about victims that are conscious or heavy", "how about the fire truck accessing higher places", "how about the floor starting collapsing", "how about chemicals/submarine/airport/extinguishers/jammed-doors" and actually reveal the game's true nature as a top-down design that asks us to houserule it: since rules come down from what makes thematical sense, you might be blinded by all the chrome and overlook for a while that in the end, FPFR's mechanisms don't really escape their Pandemic heritage. Except the game is more fiddly than Pandemic, is more random than Pandemic, has more downtime than Pandemic, has more rules than Pandemic, has more unclear rules questions than Pandemic, has a longer setup time than Pandemic, is more prone to action points accounting than Pandemic and has less interesting decisions than Pandemic.

When the most fun part of your game is rolling the fire dice in the hope you'll have to deviate from the current perfect plan, you know there's something wrong. Also so many attempts at thematic integration to have your core mechanic be "fire and victims spawning at random places" feels like a waste.

Nice little coop game, much in the same vein as Forbidden Island only without the cool artwork.  Good components though, and solid gameplay, a quality family game.


UPDATE:

Not played this in a while so we broke it out and actually convinced my staunchly non-gamer sister who was staying with us to join in.  The rules are simple and fast playing – although we opted for the basic game so as not to overwhelm my sister’s non-gamer brain - and it didn’t take much time to pick back up at all.  The family friendly coop theme makes me think of Forbidden Island, as does the simplicity, though FI has seen more play time.  We set up in 5 minutes flat, scanned the rules, and quickly managed to rescue a few peeps with my sister carrying all the animals out of the building, and me mostly catching false alarms, much to the others’ mirth (I make for a very lazy fireman apparently, who spends most of his time outside the building smoking fags).  Then the fires started breaking out in force and smashing the building up at the same time.  Before long we suffered two casualties to the smoke and flames, but we had rescued the requisite 7 victims to win the game.  Undeterred about the game actually ending we carried on to rescue the final victim just to see if we could.  And we did.  All in it took less than 30 mins and was good, family friendly fun.  My sister tried to hide the fact that she enjoyed herself enormously and then let us get back into the nerdier games where we get to blast things and slay monsters.  Great components, and clear gameplay.  Makes me wonder what Indie would have done with Fantasy Quest.

UPDATE 20/12/16 - I rate this alongside Forbidden Island and Desert as a solid, thematic family game, but with very little appeal for solo play.  Still, its appearance here reminds me I should buy some expansions as stocking fillers for the little one for Christmas...

Plays 6P the worst between this, Incan Gold, and Libertalia...

But better at alpha gamer issue than pandemic and more realistic though more random. Good theme and acales 1-5 very well though 6 is considered too easy. Beginner and expert mode nice as well as double sided board!

After first session, was really disappointed. Feels random the dice rolls and swings of either too easy or too hard. Much luck proneness in this. Tracking AP every turn up to 4 is actually not easy for me so prob not easy for beginners so not very gateway esque. Turns feel semi fast but it feels like a lot of upkeep and die rolls are annoying and not very climactic imo. Also kept forgetting about replenishing POIs and sometimes small things like smoke turning to fire, felt too upkeepy for the low amount of thinking and obvious choices.

Theme was okay, but I dislike the art and the char powers feel eh. Tracking up to 7 movement for example is too much imo. 5 at most or so, and these arent all simple actions, necessarily. Gameplay itself felt obvious and a bit routine and dint feel sense of peril or attachment honestly.

Super cooperative game! I like the fact that you can choose to play family or expert version. You can adapt the difficulty to the players. It takes about 40 min to play and it's easy to do another game just after a defeat. You really feel you are a fireman who saves lives and put out the fire. Depending on the arrival of the fire, you can be overwhelmed and it's just the panic on board. No stress you have the fire truck to handle the situation, ouf!

I gave this game another go recently, and I have to say it's a bit better than I remember. I actually like this game.

I don't really like playing with only one character each. I really feel like even if you're only playing with one other person, it's worth it to be playing with two people each. It makes the game a bit more interesting and keeps the house from burning down because firefighters are in multiple areas of the house.

It's a somewhat quick setup, and quick put away time. It's easy to teach, not too complicated to learn, and offers enough tactical flexibility to remain a fun game to play every now and again.

I would by no means consider this a game I could play all the time, but I can say that it's worth having in a collection and playing with people that are somewhat competent.

Flash Point is a great co-op that comes recommended.

My wife and I are big co-op fans, with our favorite easily being Eldritch Horror. But while still being a co-op, Flash Point scratches a very different itch.

The setup takes just a few minutes and it plays pretty quickly, about 45.

Thematically, it immerses you in a unique and strangely fun environment - putting out a house fire trying to keep people from roasting. I thought this worked well for myself. But it could also work for someone that is put off by the common stock of board games: monsters, lazers, and spaceships (if you are unfortunate enough to know such a person).

The game also feels like it would scale very nicely with players. Although while I have not tried it with 6 (the max), it feels like there might be too many cooks in the kitchen. 2 to 4 strikes me as a good range.

I just found out that we were playing the fire truck driver wrong. The game "easiness" may have just been fixed.

This game is our go to game and has been for the past two months.  Fired it up every weekend since getting it, played it with about 15 new people and they all couldn't get enough of it.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue plays similarly to Pandemic but there is more consistency to the difficulty.  Where you can have a string of bad luck happen enough that you will get blown out the water like Pandemic this happens a lot less frequently.

This is good because it allows for a more consistent tension throughout the game.  Bad things happen and you have to mitigate them, where as in Pandemic when the game starts to amp up and get exciting, you lose shortly after.

The only negative to the game is the game board which I feel is a clear notch down from Ticket to Ride which has a much larger game board and it feels a lot sturdier than FP:FR.

Another co-op game. I like the theme in this one. I like how it plays. I like the different player powers. It is still a co-op though and that just doesn't do it for me enough to get above a 7 and no buy.

The theme really works and comes through in this one. While there can be a bit of 'alpha-gamer' issues with it, I think it can be easily avoided with the right group. Can be quite random, though, so you can lose or win depending on die rolls.

RATING: 7
The graphic design is nice and very functional, and the components are high quality.

Family level is very basic, with very simple rules, and very easy to solve, but its rules are very streamlined, perfect for family play. The advanced game is for gamers, with special abilities and more rules. It will still feel simple (concerning rules, not difficulty to beat it) to most gamers.

It feels very easy, even on veteran level, once you control the initial fire. Still, the game is fun, it is like a puzzle that changes constantly and forces you to adapt to it. I have not tried Heroic level, but I guess it can be too much. Of course, I imagine you can always house rule the setup to make it more difficult, but at the end, the outcome might depend more on dice rolls than in skill.

It is very thematic, the mechanics fit well with the theme, and even if there are some minor concessions, you never cease to believe this game is about putting out fires.

The characters are not that balanced, but since it's cooperative and you're allowed to change, there's no problem with that.

The difference bewteen 2st and 2nd edition is the wooden pawns vs plastic firefighter figures and wooden vs plastic cubes. Also, components (rules, reference cards, card names) were in German/English in the 1st edition, and now they're only in English.

RATING: 7
A pretty basic cooperative game where every player is a fireman trying to get victims out of a burning house. The way fire spreads is mechanically and thematically solid. Big plus for having a good theme but suffers from the most basic coop game problem that without any hidden information it is essentially a multiplayer solitaire game. Easiest to play with less players/firemen as then you get more actions between same firemen and fire doesn't spread that much between turns.

I bought this to play with the kids-I hate forbidden Island and this seems like a good/deeper alternative.  The theme and narrative in this game are very strong.  For gaming with adults I still prefer heavier co-ops like ghost stories, Dawn of the Zeds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the better co-ops I've played. What's nice about Flash Point is that it feels totally moddable based on the difficulty level that you'd like. It's easy and quick to swap fire trucks/hot spots/hazmats in and out of a game on the fly, so it's easy to teach but scales up to a brutal challenge.

Another interesting thing about this one is that it works really, really well with young kids and non-gamers. Where concepts like trading in cards for treasures in Forbidden Island can be difficult for my oldest boy, Flash Point's rules are just logical: "Dad, I'd like to put out that fire there." "Ok, son, you've got four points so you can put out these two or just this one and then move." It's very easy to translate what someone wants to do into the confines of the action point system.

Finally, the theme is great for a non-linear co-op. You can feel the immediacy of the threat as the fire grows larger and larger. For being such a Euro-inspired game, it sure has a great narrative every time.

[b]Flash Point: Fire Rescue[/b] was sold via auction 4/4/15 (with 2nd Story expansion). 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Another COOP that started with a bang and then fizzled out. The other two plays came in May 2014 (one month after we got it)  and then just sat on the shelf. I finally decided to get rid of a few weeks ago to make some room on our game shelves.

Flash Point is a good family game, but co-ops continue to not get played in my house (well except for Forbidden Island).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]First I need to say that I am not a huge fan of Coops, but I wanted to try to find one that was thematic and that I could enjoy playing with my family. Long story short, Flash Point fills that niche in our collection.

Highlights:
- Awesome theme that is well integrated into the game mechanics.
- Great family game and since it is a coop you can potentially play with younger kids.
- Great bits that enhance the game.
- You actually feel the tension ratchet up as a house fills with smoke and fire.
- The group of characters you can play are all interesting and affect the game in different ways. Sometimes it does make sense to change the character you are playing as.[/i]

Fire, explosive material and flashpoints! And a poor home with tons of people and pets in it that you need to save. In our games the cat must be saved...but that's just a house rule. 

I remember back in the day when I felt a little hesitant to buy Pandemic because the theme was so serious. I thought the same thing about this. I do think Pandemic is a better game, but I really enjoy playing Flash point too. It is tough to save the people and the theme is captured exceedingly well. The threat of the fire spreading through the home is intense and seems pretty realistic. The use of the ambulance and fire truck are awesome, and the special character powers are all fun to play.

RATING: 8
A Pandemic style co-op, in that you get 4 action points to move around the board and/or eliminate fire (aka disease cubes) before the fire over-runs you and kills the victims lying there in the building before you rescue them. Again similarly, each player gets a special power that allows you to specialise (extra movement for rescuing victims, or extra actions for fighting fires, etc). Flash Point adds a load of randomness over Pandemic though in the construction and spread of the fire, all controlled by dice each turn. The explosion rules invoking a sudden spread of fire are a nice touch, adding drama to the game. And that's the game's great attribute (esp. over Pandemic) - the theme. You can put yourself in the building, rescuing victims, or wading around the edge of the fire pushing it back. It's also a theme that kids love, and this is easily playable by kids 8 and up. As a team you can choose to get the fire under control first and then start rescuing victims (which makes for a longer game) or just race to collect the victims and get them out of the building, fighting fires opportunistically. Allowing players to change roles mid-game provides for an interesting decision, but other than that the game is pretty straightforward. Turns are fast because the decisions aren't that hard once your strategy is decided - it's move or fight fire. It's probably a tad longer than Pandemic. This is for co-op fans who get fired up by the thematic appeal.

Awesome co-op where you have to rescue people and pets from burning buildings. It's good fun being a fire-fighter and working together to get those victims out, reminds me a lot of pandemic but I feel this game has more choices available to the player, quite often there isn't one right choice to make, the fire spreading dice mechanism probably creates this. Game is often better when everything is on the line and about to come crashing down on you, makes for an exciting and fun game.

RATING: 8
What I like:
- VERY thematic, and the theme has wide appeal
- Simple to teach (especially the basic version)
- Interesting and deep (especially the advanced version)
- Plays quickly (45 minutes even with a few first-timers)
- Can work solo with a single firefighter
- Banking actions is genius, and switching roles mid-game is cool

What I don't like:
- With 6p, even though it's short, it can feel a bit long

I think the weight of 2.3 is about right, but a bit high if anything. It is comparable to Pandemic in complexity and replayability. FP:FR might be slightly more random/swingy thanks to the dice.

This was a 9 for me for a long time, but recently I just found myself less interested in playing it. Even more recently, I lost a family member in a house fire, so I doubt I'll play again for a bit. Not the game's fault, of course, and even before that tragedy, it really was an 8.

DISCLAIMER: [b]I was a playtester for FP:FR[/b]. I bought the earlier Flash Point predecessor on my own, and had posted nice things about it on BGG. Then I was asked to be a playtester for FP:FR, and happily did so. When the kickstarter project came along, I signed up so I could get a copy with the improved rules and components.

Amazing game!  Every time this hits the table, it's a great hit!  I've played this game a number of times solo (I don't count my solo plays), and I'm really in-love with this game.  You really feel like you're fighting the fire, and the tension is there to rescue all the victims before the fire overwhelms the building.  There are amusing moments, though, when people just appear out of nowhere in the building, and you're like, "Why didn't you cry out earlier, when I was in that area of the building??!?  Have you been STARTING the fires?"

If this game didn't have a serious runaway win/loss problem, in terms of the way that fire spreads, it'd probably be a 10.  It's highly thematic, mechanically solid, and surprisingly nice on the table.  But I can usually tell just a few rounds in how the game's going to go.  It also doesn't help that a Driver/Operator is basically essential to winning on higher difficulties, and that person doesn't really get to do much during the game other than fire the water cannon.  Still, it's quite a bit of fun, and if I'm willing to put up with its quirks it's almost always a good time.

I'm not a huge fan of cooperative games, but this is one of the better ones out there.  Each player takes on a role, which will help them either put out the fire or save victims.  You can actually change roles mid-game, though generally this is more effort than it's worth.  So you run around, discovering if certain spots contain real victims or are just red herrings, and try to get them out before the house burns down.  Each player's turn is, of course, followed by the spreading of fire.  If you rescue a certain number of victims, then you win.  The game is very thematic, and the cooperative nature fits right into the theme.

An interesting and fresh take on a co-op game.  I like the variety of roles, the many different actions, the ability to switch roles, and the overall feel of being a firefighter.

The difficulty is very variable.  I found it can be very easy or difficult depending on the setup.  Often, we had easier setups.  I also wish there was more board variability.  The game has only two boards (structures) and can get stale, despite variable setup.

Another ho-hum co-op. There's always going to be one poor schlub sitting in the fire engine, riding around and shooting. Dice rolling for fire and POI placement gets tedious, especially during setup, where you have to reroll if you get a space that is already occupied.

A little over rated. More tactical and reactionary than other games of its type. Family game is for kids. The advanced game is the proper way to play.

The expansions are nice challenging additions to add some variety and breath new life into the game. Recommended if you like the game.

edit: Despite improving greatly at this game there is only so much you can do to influence a win. 2 wins 7 loses is painful. 

I like a hard game, but this is hard in a way that's largely outside your control. The randomness is just too chaotic. Poor play rewards you with a 100% loss rate. Exceptional play rewards you with a 30% success rate depending on map, your team, and conditions. 

The Fire captain, Deck-gun operator, and Generalist are critical to success and should always be on the team. loses are usually due to building collapse. This is why they added a structural engineer to the expansion to help with that.
The more people that play the harder the game gets.

It's a fun group co-op experience, but the lack of control and success, is hurting the game for us. Probably keep it around for the non-gamers.

We love co-ops and this is maybe the most compelling co-op we own...saving other people's lives!  Play reminds you of pandemic but arrives via very different mechanics.  I'm not usually a fan of dice and, to be honest, the dice placed smoke and fire in the game aren't very logical...neither are the dice placed 'Points of Interest'.  The game is immersive enough and good enough to overcome its issues.  We don't reach for it as much as we used to but we still enjoy it as much when we do.

Rules are intuitive because of the theme. There's a sense of accomplishment when you work to put out a dangerous fire or drag a victim to safety. Still, what you do on your turn isn't that interesting (move, remove fire) and the actual danger feels somehow more random than in other similar games.

A dice rolling co-op firefighter game in the Pandemic genera.  Flash Point is a nail biting and groan inducing game where you have as much fun when you win as when you loose.  Also, there are two versions of the game.  A "family" version with much simpler rules and an "expert" version that is punishingly fun.  A worthy addition of the family.

another great theme/mechanic mashup, this game just shines when being played, it becomes second nature and reacting to whtever happens becomes second nature, it feels so intuitive playing this game. IT is a cooperative game where you have to save a building from collapsing from fire just in time.

Great fun times. I think I like it more than Pandemic. too bad the set up is a draaag.

RATING: 9
Wow, this is a fun game. It scratches the same itch as Pandemic, but without it feeling as much like a puzzle. The slightly unthematic Hot Spot mechanic (a fire lit under the toilet, so therefore that means more fire in the bedroom), and some of the fiddliness of the bits, especially in later expansions, knocks the rating down for me, just a tad.

I really do love the themeing, but far too easily do I find us having absolutely crushed the fire thanks to the horribly overpowered driver specialist.

Fantastic cooperative game, with lots of tension because of the crazy fire and the rush to save all victims. Kids and adults love it,an excellent family game with an excellent theme.

Inlcudes Expansions:
- 2nd Story: Adds 2 two new floors. 

- Dangerous Waters: Adds ship and submarine scenario, that gives a diferente gameplay and environment.

- Honor & Duty: Adds an Airplane and Metro scenarios that are very interesting..

- Urban Structures: More building options and a new character "Structural Engineer", plays very weel with Extreme Danger Expansion.

RATING: 8
Super fun. Great components, just the right amount of random given the fact that fire is pretty unpredictable. Enough things to keep it entertaining for a light game. Easy to learn and pretty challenging. Love how the fire spreads, easy and nice. Like the variety of the characters and how each one plays an important part. Also like how a specialist has difficulty in situations that he has not been trained for, like the ones focused on rescuing who have more trouble with stopping fire, and how the ones that fight fire better are slower.

I just got the game and played it with the wife a couple of times and played solo a few times and have to say I like it! Most games came down to the wire where we won or loss,Some games we caught some breaks and spawned the victims right in our face for a easy rescue.
Everything looks great and Very thematic,every turn you see the fire spreading as you race to save people and cats and dogs too! 
It is similar to Pandemic but Different,I feel Flash Point has more action and is more fun to play. But then I feel Pandemic builds more tension with every turn.
Over all I would recommend this game,easy to understand,not to long to play and looks great!
On the down side I dont think it will have Tons of replay,but maybe the expansions will add that for you,I wil say it's a buy.

RATING: 9
Really good coop game about rescuing people out of a burning building before it collapses.

A few fires are out at the start of the game and then smoke spreads each player turn. All smoke adjacent to fire also becomes fire, so at times a buildup in a closed room can be a real nailbiter. All it takes is a single spark and there is fire everywhere. At that point the walls can collapse really fast.

The game has different roles with the possibility of spending actions to switch roles to gain the capabilities of different specialists.

Three levels of difficulty and a two sided board with an easy and a difficult side make for a varied experience.

One important difference when compared to my other favorite coops, Pandemic and Eldritch Horror, is that this game does not have a timer. The two other games have the Player deck and Mythos deck respectively that are drawn from every turn and if you must draw a card but can't, you've lost. The lack of timer allows for a slower, more methodical approach to playing. As long as the fire is under control you're good.

This game scratches the same itch as Pandemic but different enough that I probably would add it to my 40+ game collection if I couldn't play someone elses copy.

10+ (8+) Best 4 (Rec 1-3) 45mins

Another co-operative design which easily allows players jump in or out of a session, making it a great "entry" game if someone is hovering about interested in what is going on. (In Flash Point it adds to the theme: "hooray, another unit has arrived/oh no, call an ambulance").

Because of the miniatures, the board, the fire tokens, the actions of chopping etc and the way the fire behaves makes it easier to translate into an exciting drama, making it marginally better than the cube spreading diseases of Pandemic. 

Yes the die-rolling in Flash Point adds a lot of randomness compared to the draw deck of Pandemic, but I feel because of the unpredictable (and thematic) way the threat is done means less firm data for the alpha attitude (it happens) to stamp control on other players decisions and moves.

My only quibble is it seems the family rules and set up make the game too easy, but maybe it is the "front side" of the board that makes it less challenging. For me it is easier to explain during advance randomising set up what explosions do (especially using the marker from 2nd story) and shockwaves, adding hot spots and damage markers where applicable. This seems to make the game more dramatic and quicker game end. Adding these rules and the advance placement rule of POI reduces the vibe of too much die rolling and making placement quicker.

Played it only once, but similar to Pandemic, this game brings out a sense of urgency and impending doom at certain points of the name. One minute you're doing fine and putting out fires around you, the next minute you could be scrambling to save the victims because an explosion occurred and you're surrounded by fire. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the co-op games with simple to understand rules and which I feel that the theme really sticks to it. Unlike Pandemic where I'm just removing cubes and saying I'm treating those diseases, in this game I can carry victims OR heal them if I have a certain role(Paramedic?) and have them follow me instead. I will choose this as the first(gateway) co-op game to introduce to non-boardgamers.

RATING: 5
Nice coop game to play with kids. They love the theme. But as a game, I don't find the decisions very hard or the game challenging especially with the right combination of powers and specialists. The fire truck guy is a must though. Without him I could see the building burning down. Of course, IC won't play without him and I think he will want to be him every time now after the first time I had him,

A good cooperative game with nice mechanics. I am not a big fan of some of the gameplay flow, however the ability to chop walls works quite nicely. I enjoy the game and would love to keep it, however while the base game comes with two maps I feel like I would want to get the expansions.

One 4-player game with semi-advanced rules. It was fun and easy, a good introduction to gaming that is less fiddly than Pandemic.

A 2-player 'Family' game ended in a win with 7 saves and only 1 Damage and 0 Fire markers remaining.

Three 5-player 'Family' games ended in a easy win with Intro-setup, a bad loss with 5 initial 'explosions', and a tight win with 4 initial 'explosions'.

I think 3 or 4-players might be the best as 5 or 6 make it too easy to have Firefighters in nearly every room, as needed.

Note: The excitement level is very dependent on the Advancing Fire DR. One playing with new players was so boring that they were obviously disgusted with the waste of time...

A great theme for a co-op. While I enjoyed the game, resolving explosions/shockwaves felt more fiddly than I would have liked, and I still don't quite understand how the deck gun works. While I liked the randomness of the POIs, and found it quite amusing that my rescue specialist saved three that turned out to be nothing all in a row, I found it a bit unthematic that the POIs could appear in, say, a room that had been blazing the entire time having somehow survived multiple shockwaves and explosions. I can't help but compare Flashpoint to Pandemic and find it a bit less elegant and streamlined. I would definitely play again, but would highly recommend Pandemic if you're struggling to make a choice.

Interesting observation about Flash Point: When this games works well its SUPER fun, but occasionally (maybe 1 in every 6 games?) we totally destroy the fire and dominate and its a bit boring. This is usually linked with strong fires in the early game and a couple of turns with a successful firetruck operator. 

Overall good game. Thinking about playing a house variant without the firetruck operator to keep it challenging.

Pros:
* Co-op. If you don't think that's a pro, there's not much point in looking any further at this game.
* Once you get the hang of it, the turns are really quick.
* The "Rising Water" mechanic feels nicely thematic. A collapsed building is a more dramatic ending than running out of a draw deck. It's also kind of neat that there's some benefit (shortcuts) to having the walls blow up.

Neutral:
* Suffers from typical co-op issues - it's just a puzzle you're solving together, an alpha player can ruin it for everyone, the game gets easier as you both get better at it rather than becoming more challenging as your (human) opponent improves, etc.

Comparisons:

* While I can't say if I like it better than Pandemic, it does have a similar feel. I never liked the hand-management part of Pandemic that requires you to stategize around swapping cards back and forth (especially when you play by the rules instead of keeping them face up on the table). FP doesn't have that issue.

= 2014-08-08 - R:7.5

I don't actually know if I like Flash Point (FP) more than Pandemic (P). It's been a long time since we played P and our tastes have changed a bit over time. I also don't know if FP feels all that different from P. In both cases, we've only ever played with the base game (no expansions) and in the case of FP, we haven't even played with the full rules yet (still no hazmats, still counting people save as soon as they get outside, still having new POIs clear the smoke/fire of the location they land on).

Both that's not the point. The game is fun and good co-ops are rare enough to justify both just so you can keep things fresh. Which brings us to co-ops in general. I visited my brother a couple months ago and we played Zombicide. One of the reasons I have such a hard time getting through my collection of games is I dread teaching people the rules for a game. If it's a game I already know how to play, I know it's going to take a couple plays before the new player is competitive (one of the reasons we like games with high luck). Co-ops go a long way towards "solving" both of those "problems". I sat down to play Zombicide, they handed me a character and let me be the 4th of 4 players on the first round. That was pretty much the extent of our pre-game tutorial. Because it's a co-op, people are (more than) willing to help you play and teach you as you go along. You could go to the bathroom and let someone play your character without having to worry that he'll purposefully play suboptimally. A couple weeks ago, we sat down with a non-gamer and taught him how to play FP in much the same way; here's your character, here's what you can chose to do. Watch us do our turns first and then we'll tell you what your options are on your turn. Go!

I have a new love for co-ops and FP gets a good bit of the credit for that.

The theme of the game is captivating (who DOESN'T want to be a hero?) and the gameplay was very exciting, every move and every roll of the dice kept the kids on the edges of their seats, literally! (2 of them fell off their stools at the game cafe!) We ended up coming up just short in a very close battle, only 1 rescued victim away!

More addictive than I imagined. The components are very nice and the game has its own unique flow. I may even introduce this to the extended family during Christmas break.

In exploring the posibility of running Flash Point: Fire and Rescue for our extended family over Christmas, I convinced my wife to try a game, today, with me. She NEVER plays games. After the first game, she asked to play a second; after the second, she asked to play a THIRD! I can't provide a greater recommendation than that!

This game has been upgraded with painted firefighters. They look so cool but the board could really do with a few 3dimensional items to make it look more exciting.maybe a fire engine and an ambulance model for starters.  Its a great idea and we do enjoy playing but the actions and turns are just a little dull after 20 turns. This could be such a great game with a little bit more variety to the player involvement. Kids like it but its a little too long and it dies about 3/4 of the way through.

I really enjoy this game. This is one of my favorite Co-ops. It offers a family mode that is great for the family and an advanced mode that offers substantial decision making and challenges. The game moves fast and does not overstay its welcome. The theme of rescuing people from burning houses, and the d8/d6 grid to roll for fire spread creates a real feeling of suspense as you try and rescue the 7 victims. I usually would not like the dice rolls and all the luck for co-ops, but it makes since in this game because I'm sure fire is unpredictable as well. Overall, a very solid co-op game with a great difficulty range. The mechanics really fit the theme, and it doesn't always slaughter you like many co-ops. **Wife:8

Clever die mechanic to roll to see which sections are the location of a spreading fire.  There is a balance between fighting the fire and trying to save victims.  Expansions add more specialists and locations. 

I upped my rating from 7.5 to 8 because I continue to enjoy this game and the expansions are adding more replayability to an already well designed coop.  This one is a keeper and will remain a favorite.

It has a few mechanics that make it easier to deal with than Pandemic.  You do not have to worry about the game going out of control in the matter of seconds.  It keeps to the theme of firefighting and going through a house to rescue trapped family members.  There is even a nice fire truck to zoom around the board and trash things up.

Co-ops require something special to make them into more than a solitaire game with friends. Hanabi is a puzzle where each person is blind to their own pieces, Mage Knight is crazy hard (to the point that a friends presence is actually quite helpful), Battlestar has a saboteur, this had nothing to make it interesting IMHO. It could be played alone with multiple roles and nothing would be lost from a mechanics point of view.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a really good co-operative game.  In fact, I think it might be my current favorite co-operative game.  I like the banked actions to save for later when you feel like you would be wasting them, and the chaotic dice rolls for spreading the fire make it feel a little more exciting to me than Pandemic (which is probably now my 2nd favorite co-operative game).  Flash Point is more straight forward than Ghost Stories, and to me actually feels a little more of a gamer's game than Pandemic due to the switching of roles at critical times and the varied tasks that need done to save people and pets from a burning building/structure.  A great game!

An unfortunate explosion, and suddenly half the house is engulf by fire! Roleplay as the brave firemen (and women) brave the dangers! Gets better with the expansions (Urban Structures and 2nd Story). Congrats Travis and Kevin for designing such a wonderful game.

RATING: 8
This game is great to play and is accessible for most, as it is a co-op.  It is difficult, has some good tension and really makes you think through how you're going to attack the different problems that you're presented with.  

The only two slight downsides to this game are the set-up and the fact that you can have an alpha gamer that really just turns everyone else into a robot.  For the set-up, it could come down to the fact that it doesn't make it to the table as much for me and I have to walk myself through it each time, but once you get playing it is always worth it.

Component Quality:
Outstanding. Among the best i've seen from a game. Especially surprised by the kickstarter Firemeeples.

Gameplay:
The game flows very smoothly. Each role is fairly specialized so there's not a lot of downtime deciding actions. The spreading of the fire is actually pretty ingenious and makes for a chaotic good time. A TON of extra options for game setup, especially with the Urban Structures expansion, meaning it's very hard for the game to ever grow stale. Definitely one of my favorite cooperative games.

RATING: 8.5
I've rated this an 8 after my first play.  Our group of five had a lot of fun even though it turns out we weren't good fire fighters and let too many innocents burn to a cinder.  I felt that the roles were very diverse and fun to play.  I also really like the rule that allows you to switch roles if you return to the truck.  Our hazmat specialist had finished up all the hazmat and was able to return as the generalist.

The components seemed well made and I always like a double sided board for variety.  

Looking forward to playing this again soon and hopefully earning our first win.

Updated to 8.5: this game continues to grow on me.  Very good balance and theme.

Only played the basic game, which initially felt anemic with low co-operation required. However, towards the end of the game when the conflagration spread, there emerged a higher degree of co-operation and tension.

sold - Just makes me want to play more pandemic - the saved AP mechanic is pretty neat in concept but ends up feeling like a gimmick without much purpose, most of the time it's best to just do the action now. Nevertheless, I wish more games used that mechanic.

I don't really like cooperative games. Therefore I played only one game of Pandemie so far, and this "Fire Rescue" I playtested the baseversion (without special roles of the firemen) at the fair "Spielewahnsinn" in Herne. I like "Fire Rescue" better than Pandemie. But I found it quite boring, no real challenge. My group of 4 players won against the fire. O.k., in the advanced game there are 3 difficulty levels to choose, and the different roles of the firemen should make the game more interesting, but its not my type of game.

Fun for the first few games, then becomes a bit boring. We tried a whole bunch of expansions but they never worked for us - didn't really bring anything new, just some new maps and a few minor changes. Furthermore, we could never seem to find the right difficulty level for us - the "normal" level was too easy, while the "difficult" level was too punishing. Will probably be playing this a handful of times a year.

One of my favorite "players vs the board" cooperative style games. Everyone really feels like they are necessary to the success of the team and the variant rules make it easy to adjust the challenge to the skill level of the group. It can be susceptible the "alpha player" issue where one person takes over the game by telling everyone what to do on their turn, but with the right group it's outstanding.

Jumped right into the experienced game and had a blast planning our moves, rescuing the victims.  Good coordination between players let us get 7 victims rescued pretty easily, so we tried again and kicked it up a notch by moving to Veteran level and flipping the board.  And then we had our behinds handed to us.  The difference in the structure as well as the additional difficult resulted in too much damage before we could even rescue our 3rd victim.  At least we didn't lose anyone on purpose - their remains were found in the ashes of the collapsed building.

Great fun with laughter and conversation around the table.  Easy to teach as well so I can see this one hitting the table in many settings where a lighter game playable in about an hour but requiring some planning is needed.  Very thematic as well.

Though I do suspect the red die is a bit skewed as most of our fires seemed to be at the bottom of the board (4-6 on the red die.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Seemed pretty dry on our first play (of the experienced game). The dice rolls for the fire may be thematic but I believe they should have been capped at 1 possible reroll per round. It creates FAR too much luck otherwise. We've had a round where 5 new smoke was added just because we rolled poorly. That's more luck than I typically enjoy in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I liked this more than I expected, given that it is a perfect information coop with no time pressure.  It is straight forward and pleasing, with a good mix of specialization and flexibility.  I find that players have the ability to take reasonable actions without tight coordination, but still have some incentive to coordinate strategically based on their specialties.

I worry that different games (and different turns within the same game) all kind of feel the same.  There wasn't a strategic arc or unique feel to a game, but the one turn that kept getting repeated was fine.

RATING: 8
Very similar to Pandemic, but currently I enjoy it a bit more, especially for solo play (it is easier to manage multiple firemen, since they don't have hands of cards).  Quicker setup and even though there are dice, it feels a little less random.  The visuals of a house with fire tokens and broken walls feels more immersive than the piles of cubes across a map.  Turns go by really fast and there's more potential for team work, like one person putting out fires so another player has a safe route back to carry their victim.  The only drawback I see right now is that there is no doomsday clock on the game like running out of cards in Pandemic.  Since you control the pace that the victims come into play, as long as the victims aren't in imminent danger, you can always basically stop rescuing and just focus on putting out all the fires with no penalty.  It is also strange thematically that new victims keep appearing just at the moment that you rescue one - I keep imagining my firearm saying "Damn little dog - were you hiding in the toilet? I've already been in this bathroom 3 times!" I might try a variant where a new victim appears every X turns (in addition to adding them when you go below 3 on the board).

Flash point is a really popular game where players play as firefighters working together to put out fires breaking out in a home. Players are tasked with saving the survivors in the building and getting them out to safety before the fire engulfs the building. The theme of this game is quite fun, however this is one game I did not seem to enjoy. I do not seem to enjoy games where the main focus is how efficiently you move your characters. I can see though how others really like this game.

Pros: Fascinating original theme.  Easy Game play and basic rule set. Interactive cooperative game. 

Cons: Rules are a little disjointed in my opinion. movement efficiency game play focus. No real variety it appears in gameplay. For the them there is a lack of tension.

Great fun as a two player game. My 10 year old loves it. I love it. Simple rules, fast and exciting game play. Great for giving a child (and adult) an opportunity to think critically and plan in a non-linear, sandbox setting.

Seems that wide swings of game results are possible. Have lost all 10 victims occasionally and rescued all 10 victims other times. Some of it is luck, but good play (selecting the best FF for the job, working together, etc.) seems to mitigate the potential for devastating losses.

Play as firefighters in a burning building. The objective of the game is to control the fire while trying to rescue people and take them to safety. Each player can take a certain number of moves and actions per turn, but after each turn the fire spreads. Rolling the dice decides where the fire goes and might cause an explosion making the fire spread even faster. Players work together as a team and can take on specialized roles, each with unique capabilities. One player might specialize in rescuing victims, increasing their movement ability. Another might specialize in putting out fires, where they can't move quite as far but are able to put out more fire. 

Every roll for the placement of the fire is tense and watching it spread can feel overwhelming, yet exciting. It is like a puzzle that is constantly shifting. Players have to adapt their strategy to new conditions.  

The game can be difficult and sometimes your team looses. Loosing in this game feels a bit different than they typical competitive game. One person doesn't win and another loose, so it doesn't create animosity or envy like some games might. Instead you win or loose as a team. Loosing makes it feel like a challenge that you want to overcome, learn from the previous game, and try again.

Egyszerű szabályok, kiváló szimuláció. A Pandemicre több helyen (szabályfüzet jellege, tűzterjedés, akció pontok stb.) kísértetiesen emlékeztet.
Ami miatt elmarad tőle: a játék kivitele (a tábla mattos, elég kopós fajtára sikeredett, a specialista kártyák ormotlan nagyok, és elég vékonykák), és a kiszámíthatatlanság (a kockák biztosan nagyobb rizikófaktort építenek a játékba, mint a neves előd mechanikája).
Ugyanakkor rendkívül hangulatos, és igazán beleélheti magát a játékos a lánglovagok életébe. Koop. játék kedvelőknek csak ajánlani tudom!

It is a nice co-op game with a broad range of escalation of difficulty levels available. It also has some interesting mechanics. I felt it was just a bit too random, however (too many different randomization mechanics thrown in).

I've really enjoyed playing this game.  It is different enough from Pandemic and the is very easy to learn.  I've played with three players, and with my 5 yr old.  It works well with all types and really keeps you engaged in the game.  The fire mechanic is random, just like I imagine a real burning house to have.  The only problem I have is that I need to memorize more "Backdraft" quotes for when I play the game.

Cooperative games are among my favorite genre of games, and this is one of the best I've played. It is so simple, yet so engaging. The fire is constantly burning out of control; the walls are collapsing; and people are dying. Can you save enough of them to trigger the win condition??? Ugh the theme is fantastically integrated here. I'm a sucker for theme, and this one hits the nail right on the head. Amazing game.

Great coop game that is interesting entering option. Family rules are easy to learn and the gameplay is quick enough not to get bored at the beginnings. After few games it is good to advance to advanced rules that are more difficult and challenging. 
Did not notice the "one leader" issue to be honest, as the flames will pop up in random location, therefore your advices may not be so good. Moreover it is quite easy to give a variety of options to newbies and make them decide. Flames will showup in random location - their moves may be really good :)
In theory, in family rules there is a bit of optimization, hence much more experienced player may dominate a bit, but it is also fun for them (used to advanced rules) if the flames are getting bigger so he would probably not do that... ;)

RATING: 8
The "one person takes control" problem with Pandemic doesn't seem to happen with this game.  Everyone knows what the roles do because everyone is familiar with firefighters.  So, they play their role and just ask for help if needed, "I need to get to that point of interest, who can get that fire out so I can get there?" instead of, "If you move there and put out that fire using your 4 action points, I can then move in and see what that point of interest is with my action points."  For some reason Pandemic is always Metagamed, but this one is not.

Good light conversational family game - tested on kids as young as six and they get the strategy well. Can't imagine suggesting it to adults though. As a cooperative game the wife won't touch it, but it's so easy and thematic the kids can set it up, explain and play it with their friends.

A simple enough system to pick up - move your fire people around using an action point system, putting out fires and rescuing people and pets. The base game is good for learning the system and then add all the bells and whistles from the experienced game as soon as you can.

There are a decent number of decisions to be made - more so in the experienced game - that it's not completely obvious what the best move is (but not altogether far from being obvious either). Players feel more independent than in other cooperative games I've tried, like Pandemic and Forbidden Island, where here you're not handing cards over to other players, but rather spread out when needed and directing points of urgency between each other. As a result turns are faster because there's less need for coordination, and the game has far less chance of being dominated by one player - which is good when a group of kids are playing by themselves.

Essentially the game is made by the cool theme. Who doesn't want to save people from a burning building from the safety of your dining room table? A game I'm happy to join in with the kids for some family time.

RATING: 7.2
A thematic, tense co-operative game of fighting fires and saving people from danger which uses an action point allowance system as it's central mechanism.

Players use their allotted action points to run around a house-floor-plan game board, extinguish flames and smoke, chop through walls, drag victims to safety, and even fire the deck gun on the firetruck.

After using her/his points (or saving them for the next turn), each player will roll two dice and consult the numbered grid around the edge of the board to see where the fire spreads. Too much fire can cause victims to be lost and the house to become damaged and eventually collapse.

I like this game very much, but am having trouble finding a good balance of rules and difficulty for my play group. At first, we won every time. Then, I added more hotspots and hazardous materials and we have lost several times in a row... I'm considering adding the option of playing as the Structual Engineer (expansion role) who can prop up the building to delay its collapse (building collapse is the #1 way to lose in Flash Point). I'll print the rules off of the "Urban Structures" page and give it go.

Overall, a fun game system that is fairly accessible to new players and which is not overly-prone to an "alpha gamer" telling everyone what to do.

Cooperative games will never be a favorite for my wife and I; we just don't get into them as much as we do other games.  However, we do enjoy this one.  The theme is strong within the game, you get a real sense of accomplishment at the end when you've hopefully saved enough victims to win, and its enough tension to leave you wondering if you're going to be able to make it in time or not.  Overall, not our favorite but a solid game.

Played just the simplest of version (don't know how it's called). 

It's Pandemic with more theme and less control. So, pretty much depends on what you want or which theme interests you more. Gameplay is for me far more interesting in Pandemic, but Pandemic also has the feel of a battlefield being removed and looked only though excel charts and diagrams. Here you're in the thick of it. So it that's what you want, you'll like it. 

I wish visual style would be more europe friendly (what's with the brown, you people across the pond?)

You'd think that having more random chance would make a co-op game better, but it doesn't.  In a game like Pandemic, you have a good idea where the virus will spread.

One of the better co-op games that works well for solo players.
The Theme is well integrated with the mechanics and the component quality and artwork also help build atmosphere.
The base game has a heap of replay ability but when you start adding expansions it goes through the roof. I still haven't explored all the options available.
Each character requires minimal bookkeeping so it is easy to play multi-handed, but the game also scales well, meaning playing with two characters is both fun and effortless.

I think this game will always stay in my Top 10. :)

I go back and forth over whether I enjoy this one more than Pandemic. I feel like the roles really focus your strategy in this game more so than Pandemic. I also like the randomness of the dice more than the card deck. There's just something about throwing those dice, hoping for anything but one result. This game captures the feeling of rescuing people from a burning building quite well. I always save the pets first, of course.

This is the best light/mid weight cooperative game that we have played. Pandemic/Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert all have the same puzzle of card drawing in locations that have already been hit, and that is fine, but it means that an experienced player is either going to quarterback the game, or watch in horror as the companions make a series of non-optimal moves. Not so in Flash Point. The dice rolling mechanic for spreading fire is a perfect way of making sure no ones knows exactly what is going to happen and thus be able to "solve" the puzzle. It has a fun theme and the variety of fire fighter roles makes it fun and changes each game up from the last.

Finished our 10 plays for the 10x10 challenge this year. Letting it lie fallow for a few months helped, I guess.  We are better at it now than we used to be, so maybe we need to start playing it on hero difficulty. It is one of Michelle's favorite games, although I'm not entirely sure why.

If U like co-ops there is nothing wrong with Flash Point. If you like playing a fireman on the rescue there is nothing wrong with F.P. Gameplay is pretty standard co-op fare.

Kids love fires, and kids love firefighters. They also like rolling lots of dice. I'm not crazy about the theme, but it's awesomesauce for my son. Beats the pants off of Pandemic in this regard. Gameplay feels a little clunky, but it's fun. And it's very accessible.

Great game. Requires planning and working together but not too thinky. I love how a building that looks relatively safe one turn can be full of fiery explosion the next - it's genuinely nerve-wracking to roll to advance fire when the building starts getting more dangerous. Seems to be a hit with the guys, which is fantastic.

A co-op entry that felt clumsier to me than Pandemic. Great theme idea for a co-op. But my one play of this did not excite me, and unless we got this wrong then the random distribution of the random fires appearing (as opposed to Pandemic's semi-random one) led to a tension-less game.

So my only play of this was pretty easy, but I'm sure that since the hazards are completely random that it can go the other way too and that would have been more exciting.

RATING: 7.75
A very simple (with the Family Rules) co-operative game that is still fun and tense.  The simplicity of the turn sequence lets you concentrate on the game play and strategy, but the fire is relentless, especially when there are explosions and Shockwaves going on.  Cheer when you save a victim or a pet, and be sad when a victim (or pet) is engulfed or your Fireman is knocked down (and sent to the Ambulance) by the expanding fire.  Brilliantly done, very nicely produced, and easy to follow rules.  With plenty of expansions and accessories adding variety and greater difficulty.  Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
I like this co-op game and the theme. It is probably my most played co-op.

There are a lot of little things to keep up with during the game, which is a challenge at first but not so much after playing a few games. For example: rules for advancing the fire, placing new hot spots (Flare Ups and Hazmat explosions), rules for replenishing POI's, the special abilities and restrictions on various Specialists, and what to do at each step in a turn.  I had to add AP counters/markers to keep track on how many actions I spent, and I also got a 'current player' marker to keep that detail straight too (a Matchbox fire engine, lol).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's a well designed thematic co-op, a lot like Pandemic but with more theme and less control over the outcome. I wasn't impressed with the gameplay; I just didn't think that the decisions were particularly challenging. And certain decisions seemed like the right moves strategically but were boring for the players doing them. I'm thinking of the fire truck in particular. I'm always concerned when fun or interesting play is suboptimal in a game, and this one felt very procedural in both plays, although I'm sure we had more than the optimal number of players at six.

Liz prefers pandemic. Feels more of a game than a luck-fest (the original game where she says it's just like rolling a dice and you win or lose based on that).

I only played the basis version, which is a very straightforward co-op that approaches its them rather well.

On the other hand, the game lacked tension and felt a bit too simple. I would probably enjoy the basic game for a few plays with my children but I'm afraid replayability wouldn't last very long. Sadly, the advanced game looks too gamey.

All in all, this is no match for Forbidden Island/Pandemic.

I just sat down and played a "family" game.  I played solo with four firefighters, and lost the first game--I let one room get out-of-control such that there were multiple explosions in it that eventually caused enough damage the house collapsed on my guys and the un-rescued folks within. You have to save at least 7, and as they start out as unknowns, something like five of the markers I "rescued" were actually "false alarms"--no one there--and only four actual people rescued (and unlike in the shows, the dog died along with the firefighters and other occupants).

I played at the "family" level which is six pages of rules.  I read the rules last night and knew I had to get it to the table ASAP--it looked really slick.  After one play the "family" level might be a tad more complicated than Ticket to Ride, but not by much.  The Advanced rules add another four pages and several features, including specialist "roles" for your firefighters (in the family mode they all play the same).  The expansion board (see below) rules, about high-rises/brownstones, add yet more rules, although I think they could be tacked on to either the family or advanced rules sets.

The rules were pretty good, although there are a few weaknesses in the explanations of explosions and, especially, shockwaves--I need to look on the 'geek for clarification there.  Other than that, though, it was a lot of fun in my first go.  I think I'll try a few more times at family level before going on to the advanced game.  After that, I'd feel confident enough to teach it to others.  It would make a *great* iPad game (hint, hint ;)

This was my very first Kickstarter project/product.  I paid enough that I got the "Urban Structures" expansion (with a new double-sided board (brownstone and high-rise), rules, and a new specialist card) and a set of wooden fireman/woman meeples--way cool!

After one play, recommended, but we'll see what legs it has.

It's basically the same coop you've already played but with a fireman theme.  The theme works well and I could see this being a hit with families, but for me, my love for coop peaked at Forbidden Island.

This is a Pandemic-style co-op game where the tragedies occur on a more local, less global, scale.  Which brings me straight into one of the things I don't like about the game: the fact that you can lose a couple of victims to the flames and still win the game!  (As a paramedic, that doesn't quite sit right with me.)  And while we're being negative (don't tell Travis!), the "Advance Fire" phase is overly fiddly and confusing, and the dice-based system leads to more randomness than the card system in Pandemic (that crazy ol' fire just keeps popping up all over the place!).  Oh, it's also illustrated by George Patsouras, creator of lifeless, doll-like board game characters that inexplicably make me want to vomit.  But now that all that is out of my system, I will say that the game is an enjoyable and tense co-operative experience.  And the production values of the most recent edition of the game, particularly with the individually sculpted firefighter minis, are simply outstanding!  The difficulty level is very scaleable, and the replayability is high, between the number of firefighter characters that can be chosen, the double-sided game board, and the randomness of the appearance of the fire.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7/10

RATING: 6
Co-op game about firefighters rescuing people from a burning building. Fire spreads extremely unpredictably (based on a die rolls), and often explosively; the full game includes rules for explosive hazardous materials, a fire truck throwing on water from outside, and the steady rise in heat that can accelerate the blaze.

The randomness seems much less controllable than Pandemic, as well as annoyingly fiddly. The effect of rolling to advance the fire ranges from placing a harmless smoke token to causing an explosion that creates 4 more fires (i.e. more than 8x variance in impact with no possibility of mitigation). Placing victims is also done at random, perhaps at the feet of a firefighter or perhaps in the middle of a blazing room -- though in this case I actually mind the randomness less than the unthematic absurdity of four of them appearing at different times in the same bathroom, as though the firefighters tromping through mistook successively mistook them for heaped towels.

Pressure builds nicely, characters are varied, and there is evidently room to shake things up (see also: numerous expansions). While I think strictly worse than Pandemic as a system, for mechanical reasons, the wide variety on offer would make it a winner if played often.

[Indie Boards and Cards 2011 kickstarter edition with the exp. board] {Fire-figthing; dice-rolling, co-operation, variable-player-power; optimal 3-5p} Flash Point is not as good as I expect.  It is a function co-operative game, in which players really need to work as a team to plan and solve puzzles in order to accomplish the mission.  However, I just think it is not engaging enough and the tension doesn't build up right.  Maybe, I should give it more tries to confirm my feeling.

The rules are easy to teach; though it needs some time to explain the fire spread clearly.  The game is not really complex and most players can handle this game readily.

The family version is too easy - no fun at all.
The experienced game is the way to go, but the hotspot can't help bring urgency to the game.  The fire still doesn't spread quickly with those hotspots...

So far, as good as Pandemic, if not better. Time will tell if this one surpasses Pandemic as I feel it may.

UPDATE: More fun than Pandemic with greater replayability and much better for solo, IMO.

UPDATE 2: Flash Point has leveled out over time with Pandemic. They are equally as good. Flash Point is better for soloing because of the lack of card management. Flash Point has some strategic shortcomings where roles are concerned (Driver/Operator is needed in lower player counts but is boring to play). Levels out from 8 to 7.

Whilst not as clean as Pandemic, this is more thematically engaging - for me it is more engrossing to be on a fire fighting team than it is to be involved in a global outbreak. An excellent co-op, although the plays seemed obvious in my first game.

Update:
After adding the expansions, this game really gains momentum. The tougher, slightly better thought out boards make the game exceptionally challenging and fun, and because a single play is so quick I often find myself wanting to play just one more. Really great game, best co-op I own (I rate Gears Of War higher, but enjoy it more solo).

Our first play was on playtest copy so I can't comment about components.  What I can say is that this is a really fun co-op that has some great new ideas. 

The fire movement is just awesome.  I love the randomness of the dice rolls and then how the fire reacts.  It's really neat and adds a lot of tension to the game.

I'm hoping they clear up some of the mechanics that we don't like.  If they do, this could be an 8.

Fantastic co-op. There are some mistakes that are easily made - especially around the deck gun (no diagonals!), hot spots (there's a limited number for each game), and similar - but well worth the time and money. Makes a nice change from Pandemic; very different style of game, and the "alpha geek" problem (one guy telling everybody else how to solve the game) is much smaller in this one.

Had it before, gave the English first version in 2012 as a gift to a friend who was back then an actual fireman. That was a signed shrinkwrapped copy.

Bought it back later on the cheap as a second part of an order, as Pandemic is such a hit with my spouse.

[EDIT AUG 2014] Played a couple of times. Nice game, has its moments but feel replayability and 'cleaniness' of design is less than Pandemic. Very good components though and definitely a good light-hearted coop. I guess I've already passed that station.

This is an interesting one. It's a fun co-op game but it suffers feels more like a group of people playing a single-player game than most co-op games I've played. It feels like there are always one or two really good ideas and everything is either utterly out of control or perfectly manageable. At times it commits one of the bigger sins of co-op gaming: being too easy.

That said, it's fun when things are properly crazy and the fire mechanics make the designer in me really, really happy. The game works as I think it's intended, too. I think it's trying to be a lighter, less punishing co-operative game with enough flexibility to crank up the difficulty to taste. I would highly recommend this game as a solo experience, but as a cooperative one ... I wouldn't turn down a play, but I wouldn't recommend it over Pandemic or Ghost Stories either. 

It doesn't feel like enough of a brain-bender; Pandemic has a bit of this problem as well and it's why I prefer Ghost Stories. At their most difficult, the former two games make me feel like the inevitable occurred and we were doomed. We just couldn't have done anything. In Ghost Stories, those plays certainly happen ... but they aren't as characteristic of a brutal session in my experience. Typically it feels like we could have done something else. The very simplicity of Pandemic and Flash Point makes them feel like less of a puzzle. It might be that the puzzle-like feeling of Ghost Stories is illusory, but I always feel like I could have optimized my use of the many subsystems better. All three games are about mitigating risk rather than solving an exact puzzle but I feel like Ghost Stories gives you both more risk and more tools with which to mitigate it making for a game that is more difficult to learn, far more difficult to win, and at the same time more fair. To anyone who finds Ghost Stories (or for that matter Pandemic) too difficult and opaque, Flash Point can get you your co-operative fix in a more accessible package. The theme is exquisitely rendered and there's immense potential for creating more challenging scenarios and set-ups even without opting for the several expansions already on their way.

One of my favorite game. You can easily adjust the difficulty of the game if you find it too easy.

The game is also really modular. You can play with roles or vanilla firefighters, with amublance and firetruck or not, with hotspots or not, with hazardous material or not...

Lots of flexibility.

The game requires a lot of teamwork. You have to balance managing the fire and rescuing victims. Some appear in spots that are difficult to reach: Do you break through the wall, and run the risk of the building coming down on your head, or take the long way around, at the risk of seeing the victim die in a fire?

It did happen a few times that the game was lacking in tension, but most of the time it is great fun. 

The actions you do on your turn are not that exciting taken in isolation (move 2 spaces and remove one fire marker), but fighting the fire as a team is rewarding and fun.

Tried two expansions: second story and urban structure. They are ok, but I find the base game much more fun.

Probably as good as co-op games get (though they're still not my thing).

The fact that you can change roles means that you're not stuck doing the same thing all game and there are enough interesting things to do that the game ticked along quite well.

The artwork is an odd thing though; the player cards are beautifully drawn (if a little over-posed), the board is functional and not unattractive. The fire tokens are well drawn but the door markers are almost minimalist. It's as though 5 different artists made this game, but they couldn't agree on a style and so all did their own thing.

Update: This game lacks tension. Also, I dislike roles (though being able to change them is a plus) since it pidgeon holes you in to doing what your role makes you best at.

Rating down from 6.6 to 6.

I didn't think this one was all that much fun.  I'd much rather play one of a few other coops that are out there.  I mean, I guess I would play this again if everyone else wanted to play.  And the theme is great, but the fire spread rules were fiddly, and the game is really really tactical, so not much you can do toward winning, only react to situations as best you can and hope luck is with you.

While that may be thematic, I'm not too sure that makes for a good game.

Received as a Christmas gift. I've played four times now.  The first game was the 'family game'. We recovered all 10 people. No deaths.

So, on to the Experienced Game.  First time, I played solo with 4 firefighters. Success, but only barely.

The next two times...I played with my wife, and we got crushed.

The only thing I've determined is that if you keep rolling the same section of the building for fire expansion...you're hosed.

RATING: 7.5
One of the most enjoyable games I know that can be played in less than an hour, Flash Point Fire Rescue is a superior, more detailed variation of a dire situation game like Pandemic. Instead of dealing with abstractions in a distant global setting, FPFR puts the players (or player) in a burning house where collapsing walls, exploding hazmats, and imperiled victims compete for every precious action point while the second hand of destruction moves forward.
A good combination of luck and skill, this game is a fun and exciting losing battle in which players must make life saving and life ending decisions every turn and hope that the courses chosen and the courses neglected result in the most saved people.
The character skills also mix things up nicely, though maybe the Imaging Technician's special skill of identifying Points of Interest is too powerful (choosing that character really improved my success rate right away), but the game is smart, exciting, and the deployment of the vehicles is an especially fun variable. Behold the deck guns!
Unlike Agricola (which is clever but has far too much piece relocation/counting for my taste), Pandemic (which is fairly decent but kind of annoying and very abstract), and Catan (which I thought was quite dull), Flash Point Fire Rescue is a good gateway game that fires my gamer imagination and can show off the merits of modern board games to curious non-gamers as well. A simple but instantly engrossing struggle against ever worsening odds with depth and a bunch of nice details.

Great game and so easy to play. I thought I would test it out solitaire so I knew how it played with my 6 year old son and my non-gamer wife (who is starting to play co-op family games like modified Heroica with us.

After one turn I loved it and my son was attracted to the sound of the dice cup. He wanted to play so he took over one of the firemen. He picked it up in literally 15 seconds.

Wife joined in once supper was cooked and she played the last few turns and we managed to barely win the game (only 2 wall destruction tokens left).

Can't wait to play again and then later introduce the advanced rules. Nice game design to make it accessible and then wanting more.

Not as fun as I was hoping for. The theme is great. The components and artwork are also great. In play, Flash Point feels very similar to Pandemic.

Perhaps it was because I always felt like my moves were fairly obvious/automatic? I'd play again, but it's not doing much for me now.

Solid Co-operative game. We have found that if you do not assign certain tasks to players, then you will struggle to win. I have the 2nd Story expansion as well as the extra roles (veteran and rescue dog). Both expansion are ok. Base is best.

PETA and the ASPCA must have had a hand in playtesting. Cat/dog = person?

I have developed a way to make this a little more challenging.

Similar to Pandemic and Defenders of the Realm, but not as good as either of them.  Rolling dice for fire spreading makes it totally random, which minimizes a lot of the strategy from Pandemic.  Yet, it doesn't have the Ameritrashy goodness of DotR.  So, a decent co-op if you are into the theme (which I am not).  I do really like that some of the characters have negative effect in addition to positive effects.  I hope to see that in more games in the future.

I've tried over and over, with friends and solo, and I thought at first I just needed to keep trying. But i  really get angry every time I play this game. The complexity of the fire rules in the need of for flow charts to figure out how explosions, flare ups, and the way fire interacts with smoke is enough to drive me nuts. I have bought the expansion, and tried to like this game, but I just need to be okay with hating it. The lack of precise rules in the manual and dealing with flare ups and double explosions is the thing that most infuriates me. The fact that the expansion does not come with a separate box, but still won't fit in the base game box is also very frustrating. Out of the couple hundred games in my collection, this would win the award for being most likely to be thrown out of a moving car or an upper story window.

Derivative of Pandemic. Unfortunately, the dice rolling to determine fire outbreaks is a downgrade from the more predictable Infection deck -- removing that degree of predictability largely robs the players of their agency, which is something very much needed in co-op games.  Without that predictability, it becomes more like Whack-A-Mole than a game of mitigating risk.

With the expansions added in, it does look like it has plenty of variety, though I don't have the interest in playing the game enough to experience that breadth.  I'll play it if that's the game on the table but I'll never be the one who suggests it.

Flash Point hits all the highs of Pandemic and then some for me; I love the feel/theme of the game, and the randomness of the POIs only makes for more desperate decision making for potentially zero payback (get in there, save the POI!...and it's nothing) which I find enriches the game and adds a nice degree of levity.  Would wholeheartedly recommend, even over base Pandemic/Pandemic Iberia.

If Pandemic is a sleek, aloof kitten, this game is a big, huggable golden retriever. Maybe less elegant and refined, but a lot more fun. I enjoy the "game"-ness of rolling to the puzzle that is Pandemic. And the theme is killer. I feel bad for victims when they die!

That said, the relative amount of upkeep to gameplay is a little frustrating. I don't know how to fix it, but I wish there was a computer that did that part or something.

3/25/12 - I played a couple games of this at my sister's house. I played one game in beginner mode and the second game in advanced mode. I definitely enjoyed the advanced mode more. There's more to consider and accomplish. I also like the variable set-up and unique player strengths.

What I didn't like about the game is how it feels very samey. There isn't going to be much by way of variety here. After you've played it a few times, you'll have a good idea of how any game may go. Some games you might get lucky with the P.O.I placements and breeze through. Other games you might gets destroyed by unlucky fire rolls. Besides that, the game is going to feel the same. 

I give it a 6.5 after two plays and I won't be purchasing it.

A cooperative game with a strong theme.

I have a soft spot for cooperative games with a universally accepted theme. This game is spot on in this matter. It's a great introductory cooperative game and it's quite easy and fun to play. The various roles and the random set up make it replayable enough but...

...the mechanics don't really keep up. Although the game is fun and flows relativily well, there is little room for cooperation or choices. There is a bit of downtime as well. It's more of a decent movie that unfolds while the players make the obvious choices just to keep their interest fixed.

I can tolerate this game with new players and I'll accept to play it either as a gateway game or as a relaxing pass-the-time game. There are much better co-op games although few better themed than this one.

A lot of fun and very easy to introduce to new players. A bit more random than for instance Pandemic but that has its charme, too! My biggest "issue" is that not all fire-fighters seem to be created equally :)

I don't know... it might be technically good, but I just don't have fun playing it. It seems like it's trying too hard to be Pandemic. The board isn't nice to look at, and nothing seems like an event, you know? If the fire explodes by COMPLETE RANDOM CHANCE then you just feel "oh, the fire now goes here and here and here". The game feels choppy, rolling the dice feels feels less definite as an end of a turn. You can't plan ahead on anything, which might be thematic, but just doesn't work for me. Why play this, when I can just play Pandemic?

RATING: 7.5
What a great game!

It fells like Pandemic - with a certain number of Action Points and professions that do something better than the others - but the theme is much more present.

It isn't as balanced as Pandemic, since the fire have places that are more likely to appear (the hot spots), it shows up in the board through dice rolling. So, it can be too easy sometimes and hard as hell in others. But, hey, not every fire is the same.

I liked the game enough to keep my own copy (someone else in my gamming group already has it). And I will even go find some plastic firemen to use on it!

Only played the basic game so far. Seems like the dice tell you where you have to go and then you walk there. Doesn't seem like there are different approaches with different risks and rewards. However, the game isn't painful to play, which puts it above Elder Sign for me.

A cooperative game of fire rescue.

The call comes in... "911, what is your emergency?" On the other end is a panicked response of "FIRE!" Moments later you don the protective suits that will keep you alive, gather your equipment and rush to the scene of a blazing inferno. The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack - then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse and lives are in danger.

You must succeed. You are the brave men and women of fire rescue, people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game. All the players are on the same team and everyone either wins or loses together. To win, the players must rescue the victims trapped inside a burning building before the fire gets out of control or the building collapses.

Juego coopetarivo que nos mete en un equipo de bomberos que debe rescatar a 7 víctimas antes de que el edificio se derrumbe a causa de las llamas. Me gusta mucho este juego pero también es cierto que me cansa mentalmente. Rara vez juego dos partidas seguidas ya que despues de la tensión de una es dificil querer volver a meterse en situación. Aún asi me encanta el juego. Solemos jugarlo en pareja manejando un par de bomberos cada uno para tener la escuadra completa de bomberos. Impresiona ver como parece que tienes el fuego absolutamente controlado y en un par de turnos tienes otra vez el edificio en llamas. Te metes completamente en la tensión de tener que recatar victimas y ver que el fuego te lo impide. Muy divertido y muy temático.

Only played the family game sofar, but it was pretty good fun. The game is easy to grasp and plays quickly with little downtime. The theme fits the gameplay perfectly. That said, the randomness of allocating smoke counters (by making numerous dice rolls) makes it hard to anticipate potential risk areas like in, for example, Pandemic. I feel more "in control" in Pandemic, which automatically leads to a greater sense of urgency in the second half of the game. So as long as I own Pandemic, I feel no need to own this game as well (even though I would gladly try the advanced version next time).
UPDATE: Tried the advanced version, and think it is much more interesting to play than the family game. The different roles are all useful, and it is really neat that you can change yours in the middle of a turn!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Scratches the same itch as Pandemic while feeling less abstract and more personal, since you're not jumping around a world map looking at cubes. Have mostly played on the easy difficulty (usually winning), and it's consistently enjoyable. I think it's slightly faster/simpler to set up and play than Pandemic, but otherwise it's pretty much a toss-up between the two for me. If you like one or the other, having both gives nice variety.

RATING: 7
This game gets criticized a lot for being more random compared to games like Pandemic.  But such critics are missing the point.  The randomness allows everyone to participate because the bossy player syndrome is less prevalent here.  Players do their assigned jobs and deal with the crisis as it evolves.  Because it's not possible to really predict what will happen the better players can't hijack the game.

Pandemic might be deeper, but I'll bet this game ends up being played more by more people.  The problem of the bossy player in co-ops is fairly significant.  Flash Point is a great co-op that allows everyone to have fun.

It's got a lot of pluses over Pandemic-- it plays any number okay and expands to six (whereas Pandemic is ideal with 3), the random factor makes it less solved, and the theme is pretty neatly tied in. That being said, it does lack a little bit of the pure elegance of Pandemic (the roles are a bit too specialized, I think, I guess because you're supposed to switch in and out of them-- whereas Pandemic I feel like the Medic can discover cures/Scientist treat if needed). 

Maybe the rating will creep up once I try the expansions/bump it up in difficulty (despite 11 games, I've only played the first stage, mostly because I keep playing with different groups).

I must say, I'm extremely disappointed with FP:FR so far. Player turns are so exceedingly obvious, they practically play themselves. If I'm near a victim, get them and carry them out. If I'm near fire, extinguish it. Otherwise, move to fire or a victim. That's because ultimately, there's only two things you do, move or put out fire. You look at the reference card and think there's lot of different things, but ultimately they all come back to these two. Move. Move through fire. Move with victim. Chop wall (so you can move through it). Move the ambulance. Move the truck.

Everything that's great about Pandemic is missing here. In three games, there hasn't been a single moment of real discussion about options "Carry that guy out? Yup." "Put out that fire? Yup." Pandemic has so many moments of planning, should we meet up here, or build that research station, or treat disease, or play our special cards? The order you do things can have massive differences in results, and there's always great discussion. Here? None of it.

Also missing is the future planning. In Pandemic, it's very common to come up with moves multiple turns ahead, with the various players all working together and using their roles to facilitate the planning. "Ok, Bob goes to Paris, and builds a research station. Then, Nancy will be able to move Bill to that station on her turn. Bill now can get the Paris card from Harriet, and cure the final disease to win, just fractions of a second before we lose!"

FP:FP just doesn't have this. It's due to the totally random nature of fire and victims. You roll the dice at turn end, and add smoke/fire and victims to the locations shown. The end result is anything can happen on a turn. You're standing in a room, and fwap, suddenly a new victim is right beside you making for an easy rescue. Or, it appears in an area flush with fire, virtually guaranteeing they'll be toast soon. There might be a large danger area of fire, but the new fire appears in an empty closet miles away from anything and you have lots of time to get it under control. Or, there might be a victim in a completely fire free area, leading you to believe that you have time to fight fire elsewhere, then suddenly one turn smoke appears, then next turn it explodes into 5 fires killing them.

The brilliance of the Pandemic deck mechanism is that it's variable, but it's not random. As the game progresses, you learn where the hotspots are developing and you *know* something will strike there. The card deck content is fixed, but in variable order.

It might be thematic that fire is totally random, but it's not very interesting.

This cooperative game encourages all players to work together to battle the growing inferno and rescue the helpless victims. The game has a ton of replay value. It looks complicated at first, but it's really easy to pick up - even for casual gamers.

(Jan 2013 - after 1 5p game) - An enjoyable co-op that is similar to Pandemic, but with less "housekeeping" - no cards for locations rather use dice for the "smoke" outbreaks.

Would make a good family level game.  Interested to see how the difficulty ramps up.

RATING: 8.5
This game has several similar characteristics to Pandemic, such as variable character cards and the spreading of disaster on each turn. However, there are definitely some aspects of Flash Point that are different and that I enjoyed, particularly the points of interest that may end up being false alarms. I don't think this game is essential for a collection that already has base Pandemic with the On the Brink expansion, but I'd be happy to play it again.

Buen juego cooperativo. Intenso y difícil, como tiene que ser. Los roles están bien y hay que respetarlos durante la partida para poder alcanzar la victoria. El reglamento está escrito con el culo y lleno de agujeros negros (el de la ambulancia y lo que te pasa si te quemas es de traca, pues no da ninguna pista sobre lo que hay que hacer).

Solid co-op. My son loves this (firefighters). I think the theme hits me harder than Pandemic, and I prefer the dice rolling to spread fire (vs. Pandemic cards, although the cards are probably better balanced). If I enjoyed co-op games more, this would probably be an 8.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
Jeu où les joueurs incarnent une équipe de pompiers combattant un incendie dans le but de sauver des victimes d’un bâtiment en feu avant que celui-ci ne soit hors de contrôle ou que le bâtiment s’effondre.

Un des premiers jeux coopératifs que je montrerais à des joueurs n’ayant jamais essayé un jeu de ce genre pour les raisons suivantes :
1e- le thème fait appel à une réalité connue de tous.
2e- les règles et mécaniques sont assez bien reliées au thème, ce qui facilite leur assimilation.
3e- la propagation du feu étant aléatoire, l'action optimale à faire n'est jamais certaine ce qui a l’avantage de diminuer l’impact d’un potentiel "joueur-alpha" qui voudrait dicter les actions de chacun.
4e- la version « Familiale » permet d’éviter que des joueurs non-habitués à collaborer subissement une défaite accablante dès la 1e partie et que le découragement s’installe.

Autrement, pour les habitués de la coopération, la version « Avancée » ajoute des modules supplémentaires, modifie quelques-unes des règles de base et présente 3 niveaux de difficulté (recrue, vétéran, héroïque) ce qui renouvelle les défis à relever. À noter que certains commentaires reprochent au jeu que les cartes « Pompier-spécialiste » obligent les joueurs à jouer leurs actions selon leur spécialisation avec peu de possibilité d’en déroger. Habituellement, c’est un point qui m’irriterait aussi mais puisque les pompiers spécialisés existent réellement, je trouve que cet aspect du jeu se justifie ici.

►EXTENSION(S) ESSAYÉE(S):
& "Flash point : Fire rescue / Fire academy challenge" : Non (pas intéressée à jouer solo).
& "Flash point : Fire rescue / 2nd story" : À essayer.
& "Flash point : Fire rescue / Urban structures" : À essayer.

►JEU(X) COMPARABLE(S) ESSAYÉ(S) :
Bien que j’ai aussi joué à d’autres jeux coopératifs, aucun d’entre eux ne me semble assez comparable pour l’instant.

RATING: 5
Like most cooperative games, Flash Point creates tension by ramping up the challenge exponentially each turn and giving you limited actions to use to complete your conflicting objectives.  Your incentives change based on the state of the game, and the variety of the roles and the randomness of the placement of the hazards make the game different each time, even if you play on the same board.  And if this sounds a lot like Pandemic, then you can see where I'm going.  Pandemic created the formula for a successful cooperative game, and Flash Point does a good job of duplicating it with a different theme and a small tweaking to the mechanisms.  Theme-ing the game to be about rescuing individuals from a fire is a bit less abstracted than curing diseases on a global scale, so the game succeeds in making your actions feel more immediately satisfying, but the game still feels like a cooperative game, and I'm just not that fond of them.  I think folks who like cooperative games will like Flash Point just fine, but not me.

A very good game. Especially the advanced level has an increased difficulty. I guess what I like most about this game is the excitement before each roll for the spread of the fire as well as the difficulty to win no matter if you play solo or with a group. I have played it 7 times so far, and I did not get bored at all. As it plays solo, I think that it is a game that you should have in your collection. P.S. I think it will be great to play with family and children!

RATING: 7
This is yet another iteration of the very successful Pandemic co-op engine. The most unique feature of this title is using dice to spread the fire, instead of cards. Dice are extremely unpredictable by their nature, resulting in a fire that is constantly jumping around and sometimes even doubling back on itself. This unpredictability fits the firefighting theme extremely well, leaving you nearly always in danger of losing control of the situation. The tension comes on quickly and usually sticks around, making almost every session an exciting endeavor.

The only disappointing thing about the game is its graphic design. The role cards look fantastic, but parts of the board and almost all of the tokens look like really bad clip art. I know they didn't necessarily want photo-realistic charred corpses for when things go bad, but the faceless paper doll looking things are just plain weird and sort of jarring.

On a related note, I'm seriously starting to consider putting Pandemic out to pasture. I've found that Defenders of the Realm provides so much more flexibility to the players, by not making them rely entirely on the draw deck to function. Flash Point: Fire Rescue on the other hand, offers a much more unpredictable "villain" that can attack anywhere at any time. This keeps the players on their toes and makes the game less of a solvable puzzle and more of a dynamic, tactical challenge. These two games both correct what I considered to be minor flaws with Pandemic, the min/maxed programmed relationships between the roles, the importance of turn order, and the obvious pattern of outbreaks all lead to a very predictable experience.

Having access to both of these second generation Pandemic-styled games, I find myself playing the original less and less. If this holds my interest as well as Defenders of the Realm has, I may have to pull the trigger on letting Pandemic go.

RATING: 8
Pandemic but better and worse.  Gameplay is less refined than pandemic, mainly because of dice rolling rather than the infection deck, however randomness and house fires work well together.  The better is the theme, I feel more involved in flash point, like what I'm doing matters more.  People are dying and our team is their only chance.  There is a panic, and a gut feeling in this game that I never got from pandemic.

Alright coop game but there's a lot of downtime, potential for quarterbacking syndrome, and seems a little too easy. However, the different roles make things interesting. Would I play it again? Maybe.

Occurred to me when someone pointed this out: whenever the female roles put out a fire, they suffer a penalty. That's fucking messed up.

Good solid family-friendly co-op game. Spreading fire and explosions make the game very interesting, and a double-sided board increases the longevity.

Not as great as Pandemic, but different enough, and still very good :) More thematic and more random, and some roles are harder to use. There's also more variety in the form of expansion boards.

edit:
Used to rate it as a 9, but something is missing. Doesn't feel as elegant as Pandemic I guess. I still like it, but sold it because Sentinels Of The Multiverse and Pandemic are just better and I don't have money and time for another game in that niche of longer coop games.

I guess if you or your children really like the firefighting theme, then it's great. Without that, it's just okay.

The game is supposedly a gateway game, but I find the rules to be very fiddely. Remembering all thos triggered effects and conditions (spreading of fire, hotspots etc.) made reading (and comprehending) the rules hard. In the end, I opted for a different game when I had fresh gamers over for a game night. As the theme is appealing I need to invest more time into learning this game, but so far it has been daunting.

You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you.  A cooperative game where players attempt to rescue victims from a raging building fire.

Truly masterful cooperative game.. rating could raise with more plays

I am not typically coop gamer because I am fairly competitive and because I don't enjoy being the alpha gamer. Part of the reason I like this game is that there is a basic version that is easy enough for new players to grasp quickly, but complex enough to establish a good understanding for the advanced version. It creates a feeling of competing as part of a team rather than acting as a puppet master of the other players.

Just played the basic game. 1st play through we tried to rush through and rescue people and did not put out fires. Wrong thing to do. Building collapsed. 2nd time we decided to do both rescue and putting out fires. Worked great, we won. Great game now to try the regular version.

Co-op firefighting and rescue. Players have special roles. Random setup with dice coordinates for hot spots that catch fire, then place hazards and potential victims depending on difficulty level. 911 call is made to dispatch. Action point system to rescue the occupants and their pets or make sure they were just false alarms and save the house before it burns to the ground. You can save unspent action points for the following turn is different. Light, thematic, gateway into cooperative gaming.

Flash Point has a great balance of struggle vs. success mixed with some amazing replayability, especially when adding in the different expansions/maps.

A better family coop than Pandemic, primarily because Flash Point is more concrete in its urgency and context.  A raging fire that spreads from room to room and puts people/pets in danger is more tangible than a disease that spreads from continent to continent and threatens to extinguish the entire human race.

That said, there's already a better Pandemic for families: Forbidden Island, which is a Gamewright reworking of the original Z-Man hit.  Both Forbidden Island and Flash Point are fairly random, so deciding between the two is probably a matter of thematic appeal.

Good co-op game. You are trying to recue people and put out fires before the building collapses. There are several roles that are available (driver, explosive expert, fast fireman, etc.) and as a player you can switch roles during the game. It works good but just doesn't have the pizazz of Pandemic or Defenders of the Realm.

I enjoy this game. It is quite simple in the "family version", but it starts to be fare more interesting and challenging in the advance version. A fine game, with an elegant system that really gives you the feel of fighting a fire.
May be a good way to show to people what are the dangers of this job, because I think the game creates a good abstraction in term of fire displacement/explosions/dangers (without going in too much details to keep the game simple enough, it is not a simulation).

I have only played this solo.

This is a fun game.
It keeps good with the theme, and that adds to the intensity. Fire, smoke, explosions, and you and the ones in peril are stuck on opposite sides of locked doors.

I have spent my fair share of time in the ambulance and each game I have played has come down to one last potential survivor. Well potential... I have lost them each time.

Really fun to play. Glad that I own it.

I picked this one up for a co-op that supports a higher play count and it definitely delivers.

It's on the lighter side of things, but still offers a great puzzle. A lot more tactical than pandemic and I really like that you can swap roles on your turn to avoid being pigeon holed into something for the whole game.

A quick, fun, family co-op game. Plays in about 45 minutes (without expansions - still need to try those). Game comes with a basic set of rules, which are good to learn the game by. The advanced rules makes things more challenging. Some randomness with dice rolls, but that reflects the setting as well as can be somewhat managed through experienced game play.

My 4 year old son loves this game, and I have a good time playing with him. The family version of the game seems too easy, so my son and I play a modified heroic version.

Haven't played with adults yet, and honestly don't know if I have the desire to.

The theme, however, is wonderful.

UPDATE: Have played with adults on numerous occasions. While I like dice, the first 3-5 rolls for smoke truly determine the outcome of the game. I think three players is the perfect amount; anything more is too easy. We also play with everything possible to make it harder as well as a few house rules that make it harder.

Raising my rating from a 7 to an 8 because it's just way too much fun.

This is one of the best cooperative games, and I actually think I prefer it to Pandemic even though I rate pandemic higher as an overall game.  This one just seems more fun to me based on my tastes and my friends/families tastes in games.  It does have randomness, but I don't mind that too much.

what a great concept and implementation of a co-op board game.  i love it.  it feels very exciting when the fire starts to bust out, and you're rushing to discover where the people are.  all the games we've played of it have been very close call situations.  the bits are great too.  the board is fantastic, and very glossy and good looking.  i could go on, but just know it is a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Invariable, this game will be compared to [thing=30549][/thing] and [thing=65244][/thing] because these games can be played with families and non-gamers. This is a different game than Pandemic, and in my mind the family game is easier to grasp for children compared to Pandemic. I have played Pandemic with my 10yo and she had trouble grasping that game. Sharing cards and making sets to cure diseases in the realm of Pandemic is fairly abstract. Fighting fires and rescuing people off the board is tangible.

Can this game be dictated by an overly strong player? Yes, this is an issue with all cooperative games and this is no different. However, during the game there are so many things that needed to be done it is hard to say what was the right choice. By adding some other items, specialist cards, hazardous materials (cause explosions), vehicles (victims must be taken to the ambulance, the firetruck can be used to quickly put out fire), fire intensity, the game can be quickly ratcheted up in complexity to cater to different levels of gamers.

In the end, the theme is a great one. Firefighters fighting fires, chopping walls to get to the noise they hear in the next room or to escape a wall of fire with the family dog, driving fire trucks, etc. is one that can appeal to a broad range of groups. My son summed up the theme best when asked what he liked about the game, "I liked the game because I could be a fireman and rescue people."

[b]Comments after my first 2 plays:[/b]
My rating is only based on having played the Family version of the game, and it is really good. We will definitely play this regularly.

This is a very fun coop, the dice rolling does of course increase the randomness somewhat, but it can be mitigated through good play, and that's part of the game's charm.

The theme shines through in a big way, and it's simply fun to play firefighters.

I also own the 2nd Story and Urban Structures expansions, and with all the double sided boards we should be able to explore this game for a very long time.

[b]Comments after 3 more plays with a gaming buddy and having tried the Experienced Game:[/b]
The game actually got a lot better, as suspected, with the Experienced Game. It really is a thrill to play. Sure, there's a lot of randomness with the dice rolling, but you can still mitigate that with good play. I also find that the Hot Spots and Hazmats lend a good sense of foreboding and allow you to focus your efforts in a good way, all to mitigate the luck factor.

Great game!

[b]Comments after 11 plays:[/b]
My opinion of the game was starting to dip until my 11th play, which redeemed it. The reason was that the randomness started really getting to me, especially as we were first playing with the Hot Spots, but again as you get used to them you see the thematic connection and how they are a sort of game timer in a sense, even if mostly a random one.

I also felt that saving action points and switching roles mid-game made it too easy. What cured me of these thoughts was playing regularly at the highest difficulty level. The game shines then, and basically has you arriving late to a house fire with little chance of saving everyone, except with highly tactical play.

I like this game, although we have only played it with the family rules. I like the theme a lot. I´m not a huge fan of the graphic design in that game, but it's okay overall. We won every single time, though which for me is a strong minus as I normally seek for a certain level of difficulty in co-op games. But I´m willing to dig into the other variants to increase challenge in that game. A game my kids can play, so that's a strong plus.

It takes a while to set-up this game. Luckily for us, we always bag all of the components separately, which in the case of this game, that the insert of the box had to be adjusted to fit all of the components, but it would still give proper support to the board. After done all of this, it was time to read the rules. Easy to understand, as there aren’t too many rules at all in this cooperative game. basically it comes down to:

    Spend Action Points
    Roll for Smoke & Resolve Smoke / Fire / Explosions
    Roll for Points Of Interests (If Appropriate)

Each player may spend 4 AP’s. If he doesn’t spend all AP’s he get’s AP tokens, which he can save for a later turn. This way he can collect 4 AP’s, so he may have 8 AP’s to spend in one turn. Move 1 square will cost 1 AP. Open or close a door costs 1 AP. Carry a victim costs 2 AP’s per square. After the player has spend (or saved) his AP’s he gets to roll the two dice and place a smoke token to the corresponding square on the board. Then he has to resolve the smoke. Easy rule to keep this in mind is: smoke + smoke = fire. Fire + smoke = fire. Fire + fire = explosion. Basically this works the same as an outbreak in Pandemic. After the resolving the fire, a player has to role the dice again to place an POI token on the board (if a victim is missing or rescued).

Playing this game feels like Pandemic light. It’s easier to explain, and the theme will be more attractive to kids. Although the box says it’s 10+, I think a 6-year old should be able to play this game when he plays with an adult. And almost every six year old boy wants to play a firefighter, rescuing people. How this goes on for a six year old girl? I don’t know, but I guess she would like to be save by a tough firefighter. Also the saving of the action points for a later turn in the game is a nice twist. Fun family game, that plays fast and is easy to explain. And the fact that it is lighter then Pandemic, isn’t that strange at all. That’s because of all the fire!

First impression.  The cruel randomness of the fire seems to eliminate a lot of the one-player-bosses-everyone syndrome of cooperative games.  I'd like to give this another go or few.

The fire-spreading mechanisms are reminiscent of [thing=119869][/thing]'s, or vice versa.

RATING: 9
Completely and utterly balls-to-the-wall fantastic. The rules are written a bit oddly, which resulted in me playing the game incorrectly the first few times, and having to put the game on hold for a couple moments here and there to clarify some of the rules made things a little bumpy. But once this ride gets started and you start seeing hot spots appear and explosions eat up those devilish black cubes, it gets incredibly tense and ramps up the cooperative spirit among the players.

I love Flash Point. A good situation can turn bad easily, and that keeps the interest. There's no predicting where the fire will go, which makes sense as smoke moves through the building. You really have to decide where you spend your actions and hope for the best.

It's probably my favourite cooperative game, because it takes everyone to really look at the board and make the best decisions. Unlike Pandemic, or the Forbidden franchise (which I also love), where you can easily play on your own because everything is right there: you know where the problem is likely to appear next because the cards are right there. There's less randomness, and it feels less tense than Flash Point.

When we have one damage cube left in Flash Point, the tension is palpable. I don't remember being terribly stressed by Pandemic.

A member of the alpha player cooperative game group.  One guy could definitely end up driving the bus here.  The base game is fun; the family game is irrelevant for the more serious gamers among you.

Of the alpha driver type games, this is superior in my opinion, to things like Pandemic and Forbidden Island, but barely so.  I still prefer things like Sentinels of the Multiverse or Arkham Horror if I'm going to play a cooperative game.

Like Pandemic, still inferior to Yggdrasil.

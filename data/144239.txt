Chudyk does it again.  Shared actions, crazy card flow chart, wild combos and somehow balanced.  Not bad for soloplay also.

A brilliant 4x game by Carl Chudyk.  Unfortunately, like all other Chudyk games, this one has a massive learning cliff.  To make matters worse, it comes with an incredibly difficult rule book.

That being said, this game is amazing.  Every turn is filled with important decisions, that may also empower your opponents.  The more we play, the more we enjoy this game.

I think this game took reuse of cards a step too far. It has much to offer in design ideas - the idea of a shared impulse is clever - but the overall feel isn't very much like a space-faring game. Complexity outweighs enjoyment.

RATING: 7
A sci fi themed civ building game which is aptly described as players executing the four Es: expand, explore, exploit, exterminate. So yes, you guessed it, we are daleks in this game. In my opinion, this is Carl Chudyk's most, "mature" version of his well known and unique mechanics that I feel were less refined and rougher in Glory to Rome and Uchronia with some new and necessary additions for this game. The art isn't stellar but it is passable and the components could be better but ultimately this is a great game that is unique and which plays well. Unlike innovation I can stomach it at four player individuals or teams and also two player or three player and unlike many civ builders in space this game resolves much faster and is less of a time investment. My favorite Carl Chudyk game to date.

One of the few games I have played where I'd rate differently based on player count. Two or three players gets a 9. Four players gets an 6. Five or more players gets a 5.

The more players the less you can plan on using the impulse as the impulse cards keep changing and the more you have to rely on your own planning phase. Unfortunately, you may not get to plan any cards. Luck of the draw.

The cards drawn and impulsed basically tell you what your strategy will be. Some players may not like that random element.

Less fun than Innovation, haven't played GtR in long enough to compare well, but it's a solid and interesting game, unique and fun.  People don't get it, but it really is more a quick 4X space empire game than just "Innovation with spatial layout."

Impulse hurts my brain, but in a good way. Unfortunately it's a little annoying how much there is to explain when teaching it to play a 30 minute game, so my opinion of Impulse is still a little up in the air. It's hard to get plays in.

RATING: 7
Decent enough game - I like it more than Innovation, though I don't think it's quite as deep.  Scales better too, though it's got downtime issues at high player counts.  Combat in general is pretty satisfying, so that always helps, and the ship limit is at about the right number.

Unfortunately, the rulebook is terrible and the art is just as bad...

RATING: 5
A game with signature Chudyk elements like the cards that serve multiple purposes, some cards being definitively better than others, that way of salting away cards of a colour to make actions of that colour better, oh and a big dollop of chaos.  An unfamiliar element that is quite interesting is the impulse, a shifting sequence of cards that everybody uses.  Clever selection of the cards that you add to it can open a game up or close it down.

While all the elements of a 4x game are present in Impulse, for me it resolutely fails to come to life thematically.  It remains a pretty sterile exercise in point scoring.  The drab artwork and production don't help either.  I have played with three, which was about at the limit of my tolerance of downtime. The rules are a bit of a slog and poorly ordered.

I am a huge Chudyk fan.  Glory to Rome is my favorite card game and top 5 overall.  Innovation is not far behind.  I've enjoyed every one of his games that I've played.  This one just didn't work for us for some reason, even though you would think the combination of his mechanics and 4x is an automatic win for me.  Some note that it take multiple plays to really appreciate it, but there is no way I can get it on the table again with my group given how dismal the first set of experiences were.

It looks pretty drab but the attempt to cram a 4X experience with multiple use cards is a noble one and handled efficiently enough. I'm just not sure this would ever come out over Tiny Epic Galaxies, which is not the same mechanically but scratches the same small box big space itch.

Simply the most ingenious "4x" space game you'll ever play in fifteen minutes. It's got all the pieces for making a space game. It's not satisfying for the idea of a space epic, but it's so jam packed with all the concepts, and they really *do* work, that it's a tribute to the creative genius of the designer.

update.  This game is just delightful.  Quick.  Novel. Interesting. Deep.  I love exploration + control.  Being able to pick up an unexplored sector and combine it with cards you already know still gives you the buzz of discovery while maintaining more control than normal.

There's also a rich selection of actions and strategic paths to choose from while still giving players opportunities for tactical play.

Overall a brilliant and intriguing package.

Have now played four times, and I must admit this is growing on me. Most of my Chudyk game experiences are a burst of activity over a week or two and then dimishing enjoyment (excepting Glory to Rome, a modern classic), but Impulse is a race towards a huge explosion of points, then game over. It builds quiet nicely. There can be analysis paralysis, of course. 

Rating -- This should be a suggest, but I'm having trouble getting it to the table. Indifferent+.

I wouldn't have tried this if it weren't for a few people suggesting it. Then, I saw it for sale and bought it (very unlike me). After one play with 2 players, I feel good about my purchase. It feels a lot like Innovation in that there is a bit of chaos and a lot of card combos with plenty of opportunity to maximize on what is available and more ways to plan a strategy. I look forward to more.

RATING: 7
There are so many options on each turn that it can be a bit overwhelming (especially those prone to AP like me). There are fortunately many ways to score points, and it's not uncommon to have turns in the endgame where you score 5+ points. In the end it's less of an engine building game than Glory to Rome but not quite on the full 4x level in the eXpand and eXploit arenas. Not really a tech tree because you're limited to 2 technologies and boosting. 

I do appreciate the multiple uses of each card. Putting it in the impulse is easy but everyone behind you gets to do it too. Putting it in your plan requires a Plan card and you can only do it once. Getting it as a tech is really difficult to do but is free every turn. Mining gems to boost actions really highlights the trade-offs between executing the action and making a different action stronger later. Determining results of battles and sabotage by drawing gems is also really inventive.

I do like how the game encourages player interaction by putting points in the sector core to fight over.

If I had to highlight one weakness of the game given the stated intention of a 4x game in 15 minutes per player, it is that there are too many types of card to learn. I believe there are 10 cards and having to set aside 30+ minutes to teach this game is a bit too much.

A hand management and VP race card game that plays like a board game.  I usually like games with multipurpose cards, but this one is just too random and luck-heavy.  You always seem to end up with card abilities that are specialized or situational and provide little (if any) benefit unless combined with favorable planet cards or lucky card draws.  The arbitrary and random nature of mining and combat really annoys me as well... needing the right color and size/strength of card for various actions/bonuses/combat really sucks the fun out of this game for me, especially when you have limited ability to draw more cards.  I like that it *could* hold 6p, but it's already a chaotic mess with 3-4p.  Usually, I'd rather play something with more control and strategy than Impulse.

Maybe I missed something, maybe the game play is amazing, but you have to get over the learning curve - but I don't want to try. 

The rulebook is a mess, we spent 10 minutes trying to decide if anything started in the impulse or not (it doesn't, but why not say that in the rules?) combined with the whole feel of here's a bunch of mechanics, now work out how to combine them to win.

Graphically it felt like I was playing a prototype - and thematically, well is there one? Half of it makes no sense to me thematically, what the heck is this impulse thingy, why is it shared, why do I get to do the actions over and over and then they vanish? Why do I get an action when I visit a planet but not if I stay there?

And the chaos, there's quite a few opportunities for swing here - some will like it, I didn't.

I like Innovation, I love Uchronia, I hate GtR, maybe GtR lovers will dig this? I didn't

Happy never to play again

After 3 plays I didn't like this.  After 6 I'm really enjoying it.  Every game seems to play out differently.  It's a little chaotic, which is to be expected from a Chudyk game, but not as much as Innovation.  All the pieces and mechanics interact in a really genius way.  Lots of nuances and overall a lot to get used to.  But once the game starts to click, and as I said- it takes some patience and effort, it's a real gem of a game.  Rating is a little low just because it takes a while to get to the point where it gets good, it's a little obtuse, it looks sort of like a prototype, and all that means it's tough to teach and get to the table.

This was a pleasant surprise - after souring on Glory to Rome as much too fragile, and never liking Innovation for a variety of reasons (horrible communication design, bad scaling, virtually a-thematic), I was prepared to be unimpressed with Impulse. But it kinda works! It's still clearly Carl doing his usual crazily overwrought crazily chaotic thing, so if his games don't appeal to you on some level this one won't either, but the impulse queue thing is clever, there aren't combinations that suddenly and somewhat randomly blow the game out, and the "client" mechanism doesn't snowball as much. Certainly 3 players seems like the sweet spot, 4 is OK, and you are freaking insane if you play with more than that. Anyway, I still don't think it's much more than a novelty for hard-core hobbyists - the game has a number of fairly obvious problems - but it's a novelty I'd be fine with playing from time to time.

RATING: 7
A pretty neat and unique take on a 4x type game, where you can score points in a multitude of ways rather than just battle, and you'll probably need to do a little bit of everything to pull out a win.

It seems like hand management is key here, and you'll be faced with a lot of decisions on how to use your cards, as every card can be used for a multitude of things.

Do you want to use the card for it's ability?  If so, which way would you like to activate it, as there are several methods, each with their own benefits and drawbacks?  Or would you rather play the card for points?  Or hold it back to use as battle reinforcements?  Lots of good decisions!

Overall, just a neat little game that's pretty cool once you wrap your head around it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Difficult game to grasp initially, because of the many functions each card can perform (similar to games like Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy). This makes the game on the other hand attractive as well, because of the many possibilities you have to choose from each turn. Can be a mean game (by killing off other players), so beware of that.

RATING: 8
Really enjoyable game with a unique mechanism for shared actions. Many ways to score points. Not sure I like the fact there is a potential for cutting someone out of the game completely but it's not a long game so maybe not so bad. Only just played with the right rules on the third play. I'm starting to wonder how good some of the point getting ways are. Combat seems too costly for a point and a little random, Refining seems to take too long, trading always seems the way to go. 5 Plays

RATING: 6
This game is clearly from the same designer as Glory to Rome and Innovation. From the player mats, to the multi-use cards, to the broken combos, the game screams Chudyk.

However, unlike those games, this one feels entirely tactical. You can get explosive turns, but they are the result of opportunism, they aren't the result of working towards them over many turns. On the plus side, you can be out of the game and make huge comebacks thanks to a lucky draw. On the downside, the game feels a bit herky jerky and there doesn't seem to be any kind of build up to awesomeness.

RATING: 8
Enjoyed my first play although it ran a little long with 4 I was pleasantly surprised at how the multi-use cards, movement of the spaceships, and battle worked. I ended up losing by 1 point due to a wild 10 point swing on the last turn. Some people may not like that idea but for me it helps keep everyone engaged and the idea of 4 programmable actions each turn really is a neat twist on action selection since the action you take will also benefit others. The only downside in this game is if someone is not getting the cards they can have a tough time scoring points as our 4p game one person ended up with only 2 or 3 points with the rest of us all over 14. Now I am bummed I missed the recent Kickstarter.

One play for Christine and she loves it!  This may make it up to our rankings with the other Chudyk games.  We are continuing to give it plays and it is definitely one of the more steep learning curves.  That being said, it is keeping our interest, but we do not yet feel as if we have a solid grasp on what could happen in play.

After 9 plays (8 recent plays) we are finally getting over the learning curve. It still may take a few plays before we are truly proficient though.  This game is a lot of fun and holds our attention.  We appreciate its length and replay-ability.

I really love games that create echoes of shared incentive gameplay, but can do so with only two players (my most common player count).

The players play to a common pool to create a shared series of actions the players will take.  The goal is to play some cards that will benefit you more so than your opponent, but you also have to time your play with what cards will be available on the impulse.  These interlocking considerations could lead to some AP hell for some, along with the fact that clever play can chain all sorts of actions.  It is possible for players to score gobs of points on single turns, if they plan and execute properly.

A very clever and economical action selection game, with a strong those of take-that and a space 4x theme that seems to work. I enjoyed its cleverness and swinginess quite a lot. In a typical Chudyk fashion, your main goal is to create the right combos, the trick being that the available actions are spatially arranged by you and your opponents. Needs quite a few games to start playing well. A unique little number, which I very much enjoyed and which could get even higher marks if I find the right opponents to play with. 

+ Clever and relatively heavy mechanisms for its size
+ Quick to play, but carrying a lot of punch
+ Works well at all player counts, although its character changes significantly with higher counts

= Rewards aggression towards other players
= Swingy, but in a somehow semi-controlled way, typical of Chudyk games

- The rules are not well written, but do the job since the game is not too complex
- The cards need sleeving, or will mark pretty quickly
- The little rockets are vanilla, I would have appreciated better ships, or cubes

If you read other people's comments with a rating of 4 or less you will find they very much mirror my feelings about a game. I rarely write long comments, but will make an exception for Impulse.

It is the worst game I have ever played. It hurts that there is no rating lower than a 1.

It is not fun. The theme does not match the mechanics. It is clunky. It is non-intuitive. I found down-time to be an issue. It is way too complex for what it is supposed to be.

I have only played the game once. I won. I have no idea what the strategy was or what the rules were.

This is a miserable excuse for a game. However, this would appear to be a minority view.

I've played the final version a few times now. I quite like the heart of the gameplay, but I'm not sure there's enough time for the luck of the draw to even out? (Not helped by the fact that some cards are - knowingly and deliberately - better than others, though whether you can make use of them depends on circumstance.) Mind you, I'm not terribly skilled at the game, so I may well be overrating the relevance of "luck of the draw"; most games I've been in have been at least passingly close (often someone other than the winner would have won if they'd gotten another turn), so.

There might also be something going on with the nature of the deck: every card is one of N actions, but N is large, and each card is a slightly-different variation on its action. Contrast with Innovation, where every card is *very* unique, but has several icons from a set of only 6 types (two of which don't appear at all until mid-game / late-game). I think the latter is either more appealing to me, or actually works better - but in either case, I couldn't tell you why.

I think I'd like to try playing a 3-player game to 40(?) points sometime, with folks who know the game, and see how that pans out.

Initial rating: 9. Has Glory to Rome vibe but now with spatial (pun intended) dynamic. So you're moving ships around and taking control of sectors and battling at the same time as you cash cards in for points, or resources, or actions. Looks to be really fun with more players, though my solo learning game pitting red vs. black was cool enough on its own. Also, this game looks like it should play pretty fast -- +1 for the rating for that.

Like this game quite a bit.  Fascinated by the use of moving ships from card to card to generate combinations.  This mechanic alone will keep me coming back to this game for a long time just for the efficiency puzzle.  Unfortunately this game seems to be very polarizing.  Several people in my group absolutely hated it and I have seen a few AP prone players shut down as the game accelerates.  The primary complaints are usually that luck of the draw can significantly affect the outcome of the game and that it seems you should follow a similar strategy every game to take advantage of the card distribution.  Not enough plays to see if this is true, but in my groups it seems to be playing out this way.  I like it enough that I'll keep playing to see if this holds true.

RATING: 8
Played first game with 5, which might have been a mistake. At first blush, there's a lot of new concepts in here which might throw off first time players and take some time to get used to. Add to this a 5 player set up which makes it harder to plan and you have a game that feels chaotic, but...
i'm still thinking about the game. I'm still looking at how I could control my luck and I see that experience might change my feelings about the game as I get a better grip on the cards and how they can be chained, how your personal plan can be used.
Definitively need to play more. It's one of these games where one game isn't enough to know your feelings about it.
Updated after a second play: Lots to love in here. Once everyone understands the rules, the game is much smoother and the decisions become harder to take. It's really a game of lining up the different actions you will be taking and making sure you can take as many actions on your turn as possible. Lots of different options for the player means that I doubt that a "master strategy" will ever emerge.

This is the best of Chudyk's games and if you play this you'll see the flaw in any of Chudyk's games - that being they are more complex than they need to be.  There's a lot about this game that's really easy to like... exploration to take actions and chain them together.  But then you add a card to the impulse... Then you take all the actions of the cards already in the impulse... Then you have this thing called your 'Plan' which is your own personal impulse that consists of more actions... Don't forget that you can also boost things.  One turn with multiple actions can take quite a while.  Do not play with 4 or you'll find yourself spending most of the game waiting on others.

RATING: 6
Has been called an "action overload" game, and I think that's fair.   Each player has a long list of things to do on his turn, most of which are quick and simple.  The "Impulse" ladder of actions changes quickly, and gave me a feeling of Fluxx (but not in a bad way).   The game also feels a bit like Nexus Ops, which is another light 4X game (with a central objective and VPs for battles), but the clever thing here is how it is all done with cards.   I find all of Chudyk's games to be unintuitive, and this is no different.  Hard to learn, but not hard to play once you get a feel for it's quirks and the flow of the turn.   Pretty good game, and one that I'd be happy to play some more.  (note:  it says 30 minutes....  I don't think so.   Our 3-player game with savvy players lasted 120 minutes, including teaching.  Will definitely get faster with experience, but I don't know about 30 minutes).

My early experiences with this game have been akin to trying to trying to coax a psychotic AI to do my bidding. You take actions, attempt to manipulate systems and push buttons but the results can often be violently unpredictable. Chudyk games are always a weird meeting place of complex highly systematized interlinking parts and utterly chaotic inputs. This game might be the most extreme. In Glory to Rome things can get out of hand late once lots of building special abilities start to combine in exponential ways, Impulse can start careening off the tracks and into crazy land from around the 4th turn. I love it.

Innovative, quick playing 4X space game. It's essentially a tableau-based game (ala race for the galaxy, GTR, etc) where your "tableau" of cards (actions) exists in several places.  There's the map itself which is "explored" by replacing face-down cards with actions that remain in place for the rest of the game. These actions can be activated by certain ships (transports), requiring clever strategies for placement of the actions and movement of ships to activate them. While this tableau is available to all players, players can defend action cards through strategic positioning of ships (cruisers) or by aggressively scouting cards close to your opponents home and "discovering" actions that will not be useful to him/her. Then there's the game's namesake, the impulse, which is a conveyer-belt of actions seeded by the players; as new actions are placed in the impulse, old ones fall out, creating an ever-changing string of actions that both players will be able to use.  Players need to pay attention to the strategies of the thee players to avoid helping them in the impulse. Unlike the map and the impulse, there are also two separate tableaus that are not shared with other players--the techs and the plans--providing yet another way to take actions and create combos. On top of this innovative approach to tableau-based games, there's an economy of sorts and (unlike many of those other games) direct interaction in the form of combat. These moving pieces are tied together with an elegant points system that (a) promotes conflict around the center of the map and (b) ramps up fairly quickly to create a relatively short playing time. First to 20 points wins, and there are many, many ways to get there. 

I look forward to continuing to explore the game and it's nuances. I highly suggest people check this one out.

Thought I was playing a prototype (the cards were horrid looking and the playmat stock was awful) and not a finished game. The mechanics were very Carl Chudyk, but using the 'star map' for role selecting was a mess and had that 'do something different, to just do something different' feel. Unless you happen to need a ton of plastic ships, avoid this game and stick with Glory to Rome.

I feel a little bad for giving this such a high rating. It tries to be a short, mini 4X game. What it succeeds at is being a clunky card manipulation game. For more than 2 players it's easily a 1, or lower. Did I mention its god awfully ugly.

The forced nature of the game can easily take away most of your options, and the cards are terribly unbalanced, mainly just because they are mostly very situational, so drawing them in a lucky order is game breaking.

Another innovative, complex card game from Chudyk who clearly deserves a spot in the strategy card game hall of fame (there is one of those, isn’t there?). 

It’s basically an action puzzle whereby you try to find or make action loops and/or chains that benefit you in the race for 20 VPs. There’s a hell of a lot to grok in the first play because you can build your puzzle on the board or through the extra action mechanisms available to you that work as clients in G2R or as a big action “gun” that you load up with actions and fire off at once. 

Pretty slick stuff, for sure, but can’t say it inspired me to plumb its depths. I don’t currently have a regular 2P gaming partner, but if I do, I’ll reach back for this one because I think, like Innovation, 2P is this game’s sweet spot and more players will probably feel too chaotic.

All the cards seemlessly form a 4x galaxy for your cruisers and transports to freely explore and wage wars across, as well as for mining/trading resources for victory points. They can also be strategically placed in several different locations of your Command Center, each of which triggers particular aspects of a card that can create some really interesting card combinations.

Some more evocative artwork/ graphic design might have been nice, but maybe I'd actually prefer that this style reminds me of a much older generation of PC/Commodore 64 gaming...

RATING: 2
Like a shorter Twilight Imperium with all the fun sucked out. Somehow feels longer than every TI game I've ever played combined. 

Very rarely do I expect a game to be abysmal, only to discover that it is actually sub-abysmal. This game combines everything bad about games: downtime, cards and their fucking combos, economies of boredom, bland resource management, et al. In short, it's a Carl Chudyk game: so busy being clever that it forgets to be fun.

There are a ton of games that I don't like. There are games that make me wonder why I came out for the day. This is the kind of game that makes me wonder whether I'm even in the right hobby. 

I normally don't rate games lower than a 3 unless they are profoundly mechanically unsound. I need to make an exception for this, because I hate it and everything it stands for.

I spent the second half of the game trying to build a tower of ships tall enough that I could force it through my brain via my nose. Fucking things don't even stack well.

7th play - :star::star::star::star::nostar:. Finally the game "clicked", and I feel like I know how to play the game well enough to do reasonably well. You have to play the cards you have, not the cards you wish you had. I doubt I'll trade this any time soon. It has a LOT going for it: small box, tricky combos, short play time, lots of room for clever play.
8th play: :star::star::star::star::nostar:. First 3p game of this, and it was even better than 2p. I won, and I won because I knew how to use my cards, and when to set up the Impulse and Plan to make a quick strike to neutralize an opponent who was about to win. Very cool.

Nehéz mit írni a játékról. Általánosságban jellemző Chudyk játékaira, hogy nem szabad őket egy játékból megítélni, sőt talán kettőből sem. Ezzel két partyt volt lehetőségben játszani, így nem biztos, hogy teljesen jogos és kiforrott a véleményem. 
A szerző a szerepválasztós játékok nagymestere. Ez a mechanizmus már önmagában zseniális, mivel nagyfokú és érdekes interakciót eredményez. Ráadásul ő mindig tud újat mutatni ezzel a mechanikával. Most a címadu impulse valósítja meg ezt a mechanikai elemet. Lényegében, minden kijátszott kártya ott marad az asztalon 4 körig és csak utána megy a kukába, és mindenki mind a 4 asztalon lévő kártya akcióját végrehajtja. Nagyon érdekes interakciót eredményez ez is, de talán kicsit kevésbé csillog mint a glory to rome-os vagy az innovationös mechanika.
Erre a keretre épül rá egy-két rómás mechanika: pl. bányászott ásványok, amikkel turbózhatjuk egy-egy akció erősségét. 
Mindez megvan van bolondítva némi világűrfelfedezősdivel, űrhajózgatással egy lapokból épített táblán. Van csata is, és talán ez a leggyengébb pontja a játéknak, mert szerintem irreálisan nagy a szerencse szerepe benne. Nekem nem hiányzott az előző játékaiból a közvetlen rombolós interakció sem, így nem annyira örültem itt se neki. Gond volt még a holtidővel is, már 4 főnél is. A 4 impulse kártya minden akcióját + saját akciót + táblás akciókat + esetleges csatákat lebonyolítani sok idő, szerintem még nagyobb rutinnal is. Így egy-egy játékos köre simán eltartott 5 percig is, ami 15 perc várakozást von ugyebár maga után. Ezalatt nem sokat tudsz előre tervezni, tekintve, hogy egy kör alatt újraépül teljesen az impulse.

Persze egy csomó gondolat, kombó összeállt azóta a fejemben,a mit szívesen kipróbálnék, de nem ez lesz a kedvenc chudyk játékom az biztos. Sajnos nálunk szinte beszerezhetetlen.

OK, it is quite random at times. But on the other hand it comes to an end pretty fast. There is also a bit of Chudyk's chaos, but in a rather not very unpleasent form. And when you finally learn how to use your transport in a loop, making your cruisers move - piece by piece - in a nice spatial puzzle, you feel satisfied and . :)

I was very excited for the new polish edition. But after all this terrible affair with wrong printed cards I'm fed up. Besides - the new design is less "spacey" and more greyish which means a little bit bluh for me. I really like the dark design of the former edition.
So. As I have sold Impulse to buy Impuls (PL), now I've traded Impuls (PL) and I'm buying Impulse again. :D

I love that it has different paths to victory, but whichever one you pick you still have to grab tactical opportunities when they present themselves. I love that it's so confrontational. I love the crazy chains of moves you can pull off to score huge numbers of points. I love how you can play fast and loose.

I highly recommend the extremely well structured and clear rules explanation video from:

One play with two, one play with four. I didn't like it; it has the deal-breaking combination of too much complexity with too much luck. On top of that, the choices presented to the player are simply overwhelming; it's nice to have a lot of strategic options, but they need to be clear and discrete, not thirty iterations of "well I could put this here and that there and use this here and take that there, [i]or[/i]…"

In conversation about the game someone vehemently defended it, insisting that it was a game of skill rather than luck. I don't deny that a player could get better at it with more plays—even significantly better—but on thinking about it more I find the idea laughable. If you're playing a game where, on your turn, you're repeatedly taking actions which may or may not succeed, you're playing a game that has a has a significant luck element. Sorry.

Chudyk was one of the first modern designers I DISliked; I developed a grudge against Innovation when some friends raved about it and then it fell flat for me, and my only play of Glory To Rome was disappointing and confusing.

So part of my fondness for Impulse is probably surprise that I like it at all. But I also love puzzling out the impulse and feeling like a complicated turn that uses up my whole hand to score 2 points is (maybe) a good idea.

3p and 4p both seem fine to me, though in 4p it can matter a lot who else starts on your side of the sector. Would be scared of the downtime with 5-6.

Carl Chudyk has done it again with Impulse! Impulse is yet another controlled chaos card game tackling the usually all-too-comical or all-too-serious theme of space exploration. In this game, like Chudyk's other 'big' games (Glory to Rome and Innovation) the cards are multipurpose: they are at once the map, the resources to mine and refine, the actions, as well as bluffs and randomizers to be used in attacks and sabotage attempts. Having played GtR and Innovation prior, I felt right at home with this game's structure, but at home did not mean comfortably so! The impulse, the game's namesake and core mechanic, is a different take on GtR's lead and follow in that actions continue to be used (and sometimes useful) for the the round you play it, as well as the four rounds following: the way in which a card layed creates ripples is difficult to predict, and not always easy to even take advantage of. In terms of game design, I want to say that this feels like one step forward, two steps back, or many it's the other way around: the fact that we have an innovation-esque game with a map that also includes controlled exploration (i.e., you have a range of choices as to what you 'find' when you cross new space) is a huge plus for me, however, the notion that turns become increasingly sprawling as the game goes has me incredibly hesitant to play this with anyone who has even mild AP (praise the lord almighty that first to 20 points wins). Nonetheless, this is the type of game that has me thinking after the game about the possibilities that it offers: which are multiplicitous. My initial rating is a 7, but that's not likely to stick for very long: I can see this going up so long as I can foster the conditions for rich 2-4 player matches.

After i opened the box, my first impressions were very bad. The quality and the artwork of the game is under anything i have come across so far. The cards are super thin and can be damaged very easily (Well, What do you expent from Asmadi games after all?). The rulebook is printed on 43 tiny pages, and i think it is written badly. You get a small piece of information on every page, but unfortunatelly it is almost impossible to put it together. More than one read is needed to connect the things together. After my second play, im not sure if i want to keep it or just sell it instead. It can be a great game because of the huge replayability it grants. I mean you have to make a ton of choices with a lot of things to do. If you are playing well, you can find very nasty combinations to make some mess on your enemies side. I had a chance to try it with four players, the game is so much better with this number i started to like this game immediatelly. The strategy is deeper with more players.

Pros:
-Very high replayability, with ton of choices to make.
-If you are playing well, you can find out some very powerfull combinatons.
-Cute ships that are moving around, in this mini 4x thing. It actually creates fun.
-30-45 minutes gameplay means you can play more than one game in a night. Note that it is more likely to 45-60 with more than two players.
-Can be played as a team game like 2vs2 or 3vs3.

Cons:
-The worst quality i have come across so far.
-Badly written rulebook, with small pieces of information on every page.
-The ugliest artwork i have ever seen.

Impulse is Carl Chudyk's 4x card game of space races, which employs a series of actions like the ones he used again in Mottainai.

Unlike Mottainai, play seems less deliberate, and particularly in battles, more chaotic.

He definitely achieved a quick playing 4x, but at least on a 1st take the chaos is greater here than in most other Chudyk games.

Impulse does not outstrip it's welcome, but the tactics over strategy I observed so far keep it from being his best effort.

(07/19/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is another irritating incarnation of a card game where cards are one of several things, from the designer of Glory to Rome and Innovation, with a pasted on space theme.

Rules were a tough slog, reading through a 48 page booklet. Although there were plenty of pictures, it was still tough to digest all the mechanics, just like Glory to Rome.

Game mechanics-wise, there is nothing interesting here with the exception of the "Impulse", which is a queue of cards where players are forced to contribute to each turn. There are many, many actions one can take; still, it is rather more frustrating, due to the lack of getting additional cards, and being limited in actions due to not having the right card. Otherwise, all players who have a fighter touching the center space will get a VP for each fighter there. The winning player built a steady bunch and sent them there, and it was a matter of biding for time. Boring game, and like Innovation, I am not interested in investing any more time to learn it. There are better card games out there that resonate with me. It is a "4" for now, but I don't see any reason to play it again.

Oh my god the down time! I played this with 4 and we couldn't finish it. There are a lot of steps to complete each turn and a lot of potential results from those steps. Other player's turns greatly affect your turn so you cannot plan your turn ahead of time. Along with that, it is very AP prone and luck based. Overall I spent most of the game just waiting for it to be my turn again.

I definitely need to play this more as it's a difficult game to appreciate on just one playing. 20 points to win, means there's a substantial luck factor as you may have the cards to take advantage of (for instance) a trade opportunity, you may not. Can't decide whether this is clever or just over-wrought, but will play again.

RATING: 7
This is very Carl Chudyk; there are lots of cards with different powers and they turn up at unexpected times and change the game state dramatically. I like Chudyk's other games, so take that into consideration.  Cards you play go into a queue to get used by other players, which is a really clever idea and gives me a lot to think about when choosing my cards.  The game has the potential for drawn-out stalemate endings. (1 play)

RATING: 6
Not convinced after 3 plays: it's chaotic, but without the addictive combinations and constantly developing positions of Glory to Rome. As others have said it feels as if there are too many action types (Sabotage and Refine are rarely used in our experience), and the whole thing feels as if it ends too quickly.
The components are also quite disappointing: very thin cards, and the whole box just feels cheap (it wasn't).

Very clever design in multi-use of  just a single card .High replay in collecting twenty points from diff path of strategy

Really neat game that feels incredibly overwhelming at first. Played twice so far, first a two-player learning game in which we stumbled through the rules, later a 4-player game that was a real blast. One player had 17 points and would've won on the next turn -- but we eliminated him! Fun to see a game combine somewhat solo-ish comboing/engine building with in-your-face combat. The points for being at the sector core and for blowing up opponent ships really encourage aggression/interaction.

I've played with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players.  Very good game with 2 and 3 players.  With 4 players, the downtime starts to become an issue, but it's bearable.  At 5 players, the downtime is beyond what I'm willing to deal with given the complexity of the game.

I've yet to play the team variant which can be played with 4 or 6.  While the team variant looks interesting, it does not appear to completely address the the downtime issues at higher player counts.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2015)

For some reason, I thought Impulse was going to be a light card game, but as it is a Carl Chudyk´s game, I really should know better as he usually use multipurpose cards to offer a meatier experience (Glory to Rome, Innovation).

The rules are much more involved than I initially thought, but they aren’t that hard to grasp. You can explain them under 25 minutes. The art of the cards is good enough for me (functional) and the game components are also ok. The rockets look gorgeous on the table, but it is annoying when the map (cards) move around.

Each turn, the players need to play a card in the “Impulse”, it is a way to make available actions to all players so we all collectively can benefit from the same actions. Choosing which card to play isn’t trivial. In fact, most decisions of the game are deep and unobvious. The game isn’t intuitive, but I love both of these factors.

It seems there is a lot to explore in Impulse, (it seems) there are many pathways to victory and player interaction is very high. It also seems there are strategic (the galaxy and the plan) and tactical elements (the impulse and your opponents movements). Love that each player begins with different powers.

I’m not sure how much the luck factor affects gameplay, In sabotages and battles it seems there is a lot of it, but perhaps you can control it. I need to play more times to see if this is an issue for me.

I like the theme and, surprisingly, you feel it during the game.

I played with 5 players and the game was very boring, with lots of downtime. I think Impulse is AT MOST a 3 player game, but it has components up to 6 players!! I refuse to play it again with that many, it took almost 3 hours to finish! Besides the annoying downtime, the Impulse cards weren’t available to all the players because you have to get rid of one of them each turn, so in a 5 player game you never can benefit from the cards the neighbor to your left played and I dislike that.

Bottom line, I feel Impulse is my kind of game, but I had a terrible first play experience. I look forward to play it again soon with 3 players. For now I will keep it in my game collection but perhaps it is way too long for what it offers. If I’m playing a 4x game I think there are much better options out there. To really like the game, I need the downtime and the playtime to be much shorter.

Current Rating: 6.0

I love Impulse. It allows for multiple ways in which to earn points to win the game; all of which are viable. It has a small footprint and has great replay ability. It takes a little bit of time to teach, but once you get the hang of it, which takes about 1/2 to 1 game, it is pretty easy and quick to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One play only.

Really feels like a Carl Chudyk game - fairly simple ruleset disguising a very fluid and interactive game based around a deck of cards, each of which has about 16 uses, which is fine by me.

There's a spatial element not present in Glory to Rome and Innovation that supports more ways to beat each other up, but the multiple uses of each card and the swingy nature of the gameplay echo those games.

If you like managing chaos and high player interaction this is for you, if you want to quietly build a point engine in the corner I'd probably look elsewhere.

Impulse is an extremely impressive game, and Chudyk again shows his skill at infusing multiple uses into a deck of cards. The impulse row, the timing and execution of your decisions, and the tactical placement/movement of ships make this game constantly engaging. It is admittedly dense for a card game, but is fairly intuitive once you're underway. As impressive as this design is, I don't find myself wanting to play or expend the energy to teach new players very often.

BGG user comment:

"I think I like Innovation more, but that's partly because it's easier to teach. The mechanics are simpler, though it takes many plays to learn how the cards combo because every card is unique. Impulse is harder to learn (and teach), with a lot more going on, and then you have the card combos on top of that. But once you get into it, Impulse is amazing.

What I really like about Impulse though is that it looks like a card game, but plays more like a board game. As you said "doing something, and not just lining up card combos."

Innovation is neat and crazy and fun, where Impulse strikes me as more innovative and complex and wow."

I've played the preview edition and so far I'm impressed. My rating could easily increase over time. 

This is definitely a Chudyk game. If you've played Glory to Rome or Innovation you will know what to expect. So far, I like it more than Innovation (which I have limited experience with) and less than Glory to Rome (which I adore). Like those, there is so much to this game that it demands multiple plays just to figure out how to play, let alone how to play well. Over time I could see this achieving the same status as Glory to Rome for many players. However, I think it's much harder to teach than GtR.

RATING: 7.5
Cool gameplay, nice options on your turn.  But does not leave a meaty satisfied feeling.  
There is too much luck for my taste, in whether you happen to draw cards that let you score big using what you already have.  (Note that I rate the designer's Innovation 10/10 and strongly dispute charges that it is luck-driven.)

RATING: 6.5
The idea and mechanics are good. It's such a short and dense game though, with little room for changing strategies, that I settle for a 6. It could jump up to a 7 if I find ways to overcome the trouble of getting a strong/fun enough machinery going. Maybe I will come to appreciate it more like close-to-filler-game.

--

Up to a 7. It has proved to be more fun than I thought as a two player game. BUT...

... with a WARNING, because in a two player game it can be game over before you as the second player even had a chance to start you turn (probably just as bad with more players for the poor sod eliminated)! Not that fun, and I would hesitate to introduce this game to a new player or intentionally play poorly if the opportunity appear. Basically all you need is "basic tech - move one fleet", that means a cruiser, and trigger an action, by impulse or transport, of a "move one fleet for two moves", plus some randomness of cards and boom! you have crushed the only cruiser of your opponent. From there your opponent will need a lot of luck to avoid sudden defeat the second turn. Defeat or victory in the first or second turn by 100% randomness is now proven to be plausible and  fits poorly with it being a strategy game.

I didnt come into this game having played Glory to Rome but nonetheless I found the game to be alot of fun.  

The game is to the point which I really, really appreciate... Im a 4x fan on paper but Ive found that if it goes on too long in either a board, card, or video game I start to lose momentum and this game kept a good pace from start to finish.

A Fantastic game that I feel I will love to play alot in the future.  

Ps.  Ive payed alot more for games that give me alot less than this... Probably not for everyone but its a rare find 4x in the med weight class.

I saw people playing and it seems pretty much abstract as location explored becomes cards from your hands and is replaced by a card from your hand which also seems to be used as actions. 

It's an interesting mechanic, but it becomes really abstract. I don't say it cannot be fun.

Need to check a rule video
-----
After watching a video, it seems very abstract and confusing. What is interesting about this game is how those cards that has very little information (action + icons) compared to glory to rome ends up being used in many different ways.

I don't like the way cruisers are placed in between cards, it could get fiddly very rapidly. The game is basically about making combos of actions that could be achieved in various ways. I guess if you like that then the game is for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is your traditional Chudyk card game with tons of options regarding how a card can be used/played and numerous tactical and strategic decisions to be made.  I expect to have to play this at least 3-4 times before really getting a good sense of how the cards play out and how to combo the cards and plans well.  The impulse track is well put together as I agonize every time about which card to put out there for everyone to use...both that it helps them too much and/or I want the card for myself!  Boosting is a bit tricky at first and there are some unclear terms used in the POD copy, but I'm sure those will be cleared up in the final version.

I like how some staples of space exploration are represented: exploration, combat, transport, trade, mining, refining,…

The game lasts maybe an hour, this is quite nice.

I was a little too lost, though: I did not have many ships, and getting more and getting poins required some string of actions that I did not immediately see. This is not a problem per se: this can be learned and enjoyed.

A nice game.

The variety of powers is below that of Innovation, despite using similar mechanisms (values that depend on something else), and, in a way, below that of Glory to Rome, I feel. This is what prevents me from being completely enthusiastic about this good game. I can't help wondering whether Tiny Epic Kingdoms wouldn't be better, in this genre of short, small game with an economy, and battles.

The rules are very much streamlined, that is nice.

I also like the specialization of sectors around the home planets, which makes for some different games.

Brilliant game with interesting mechanics.  The board is a series of cards and most are different from each other in some way.  On a turn you play a card to the impulse which is a central action location used by all players with up to four cards.  Then you execute one of your actions and then the impulse in order from oldest to newest card.  You can then execute a personal impulse if you wish.  Many different actions in the game and a very interesting mechanic where you can use minerals to provide a boost to actions.  

The game can be random and swing with big changes in points at higher player counts, but a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy the crazy chaos and epic swings of Innovation, so I wasn't sure what to expect from Impulse.  It seems that it is much more about action selection via the Impulse and setting up card combos for your transports to activate.  That, and making use of the Plan as much as you can.  I'm still not sure if Impulse is quite as Epic as Innovation, but I like the added features of maneuver, attack and exploration.  All in all, a worthy addition to your Chudyk library.

You can try to set up a point endgine only you have access to, try to score the sector core vs opponents, and can try to blow up others' stuff.  If they tried to tack on much more, then the game might suffer (AP, complications).  But as of now, they only real slow time might be ealry game as the map is revealed.

This has some interesting things going on.  Good game.  I enjoyed it. Like Glory to Rome the cards have multiple uses, and actions are shared (via the action queue, aka the "Impulse").  Unlike GtR, Impulse has a shared "board" (cards, actually), upon which to interact.

As an Innovation lover I had to try this. That meant patience and persistence. After a half dozen two player games, my impression is that Impulse has some interesting features, but the game is too clunky and fiddly for its own good. I'll remain open-minded to its virtues, and I won't turn down a chance to play it, but despite the freewheeling possibilities, the game feels tight and constricted, perhaps due to the materials, but mainly because there is too much complexity for too narrow a game window.

I can see lots of ways in which this game wouldn't exactly be everyone's cup of tea. It's somewhat chaotic, a bit complicated for what it is, and can be kind of swingy. It's also probably very dependent on player count. I've only played it at 3p, but I imagine 2-4p is the sweet spot, and 5p or 6p would just be way too chaotic, with too much down time for what the game offers.

Having said all that, I really enjoyed playing this game, and I would love to explore the game and the various possible strategies further. I really like the shared actions mechanic of the "impulse", and the variety of different actions and potential combos. Typical Chudyk design. I wouldn't quite put this game on par with Glory to Rome, but it definitely has some similarities, and yet is unique enough to feel fresh.

I'm guessing my initial 8 rating will drop somewhat over time, but for now, I'm really looking forward to playing it again.

Update: My opinion of GtR has since fallen a bit, so I guess I would put Impulse on par with GtR after all.

Provisional rating. So far, it feels a bit chaotic and then someone wins; and it's got the potential for insane levels of AP and the kind of turns where you sit there while a player triggers 12 different effects and scores a ridiculous amount of points... but I'm willing to persist because it's got some amazingly interesting things going on, in particular the Plan mechanism which allows you to stockpile cards for a future cascade of actions (or just as a bank of potential reinforcements to discourage attackers). Major kudos for Chudyk for again making a game with many viable routes to victory, though--you can do it with combat or with trades or with refining minerals or by repeatedly siphoning off points from the sector core.

Well the rules although straightforward for the most part, are a bit painful to explain.  And the first game took a while to get the gears cranking.  But I do believe that there is a solid, good, and fun game here.  It just takes a little bit more effort than most to get into.  I could see this rising to a 9 rating for me, but needs more plays first.

Carl Chudyk's games are really starting to grow on me, even if I feel like I'm not always playing them 100% correctly. Impulse is a neat game, as it walks a line between Glory to Rome and Innovation that makes it an interesting middle ground design. The theme is one of space combat and exploration, but it could have been almost anything. Apart from ship battles, this feels as mechanical as his other games do. That being said, I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. Innovation and Mottainai are still my favorites from Chudyk, but this is a pretty close third. My only real complaint with this game is that it can run long, especially with more than 3 people. At the same time, I think this is the cleanest of his designs when it comes to having cards attached to your central board/reference sheet. My favorite aspect of this game has to be the Impulse Line though. That's something that definitely needs to be used in other games.

RATING: 5
I liked Glory to Rome and Innovation but this game just had too much luck and downtime. Turning a card into victory points requires several steps, each of which you rely on lucky draws. Alternatively you can attack another player to get victory points but if you fail you have just made that player king to the demise of the other players. The difficulties reading all cards spread across the table don't make things better. The only redeeming aspect is the interactivity.

Cards are laid out in a grid like fashion, and players move transports or cruisers through the grid. As new cards are explored the owner may use the ability of the explored card. On a player's turn, they add a card to the impulse, and then execute the cards in the impulse, which consists of 4 cards. Players have up to 10 choices of things to do, such as mining cards, moving, or trading cards for VPs.

There is luck involved, and it is possible to set up good combinations. 

As most people have noted, don't play this game with 4 or more players. It will really bog down, and much harder to find decent cards as your territory is cramped.
This game does shine with 3 players and it is fun. With 3 players, it's easier to explore the cards and a bit more strategy as the card you put into the impulse can be used twice by you, 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seems overly complex - a lot of pressure to play the Impulse and the cascading events that arise from it, seeming to hold up the game until it's done.  It simply branches out in all directions, making it difficult to pre-plan much of your turn as you have to wait for the previous player to largely re-design the game board.
The core of the game feels solid, if over-engineered - as though it's trying to be something far bigger, held back to be quick-playing.

I really like how Carl has put together games like GtR, Innovation and Urchronia (which is essentially GtR). Games that make you feel smart by allowing you to put together great combos. However, the expansions of Innovation seems to bloat the base game. I think the base game was perfect in it's design. 

Now I feel like Impluse still gives the player the ability to create great combos, but this game feels bloated, too. There are just so many cards to activate on a given turn. I don't like how combat is resolved, and I think the game is fiddly. Just not my thing, I guess.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I really didn't enjoy my initial plays so the game left our collection. I have zero desire to play this one again. I've played almost all of Carl's games (except Mottainai) and Glory to Rome is by far my favorite (and the only one I can't find a copy of). Every time someone mentions one of his new games it's a reworking of GtR, yet none of them come close to surpassing that game for me.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]In a nut shell I was hoping that this game would scratch the same itch as Glory to Rome and unfortunately it does not. Unlike GtR and RFtG I find the race in this game to be unsatisfying and over too quick. The actions feel bland and mechanical, the theme does not come through at all (and I love sci-fi/ space themes). On top of all of that the artwork and graphic design are quite unappealing to me.[/i]

Interesting, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it fun. It's a VP hunt, first to 20, usually earned by whacking someone in a battle (flip cards equal to the number of ships, add bonuses, most icons revealed wins), by sabotage (a card power), or trading (another card power) a card for its icons. After doing one of your powers (you start with two base powers, but can replace them with card powers during the game), the interesting thing is that you do each of the card powers that the previous three players did in order, before doing a 4th power from your hand (which the next three players will be able to use). The downside is that much of your game is dictated to you by what the players before you do. If you can't take much advantage of the previous 3 powers either because you didn't draw cards that match those powers' requirements or you don't have stuff out on the board in a position to take advantage of them, then you're going to find life tough. The trick is to remain flexible and carded up so that you can take advantage of what's been done before, but that's not always in your control either given other players are going to whack your board position and the like in between turns. There's a bunch of powers spread amongst the cards - move around the board (which may result in a battle), upgrade your base power, trade for VPs, create booster icons similar to clients in Glory To Rome to boost up your end-game powers, build new ships, sabotage adjacent opponent ships and the like. Which means the first game at least suffers from what the hell do I do syndrome with consequent downtime, which emphasizes the feeling that the game is playing you more than you're playing the game. There's no doubt cool combos you can come across that no doubt will make the game more fun in future play, but there's a barrier to entry here that didn't quite work for me.

12 plays so far with 2 and with 3, and I officially like the game.  I enjoy the shorter playtime compared to Innovation and Glory to Rome.  It is certainly different enough from these two to warrant a place in the collection.  I'm eager to play more and explore the various possibilities since there is a lot of variety in how the game plays.

12.8.16: This stopped hitting the table rather abruptly.  The rhythm of the game is a bit off; players build up, then take some long turns and you don't get many of them.  Still, I might bring it to a bar night in the future just for old times sake.

This is a great little game. Chudyk has wonderfully compressed the 4X genre into a 45m romp with some novel mechanics and lots of depth to uncover. Although it lacks the personality on each card found in Innovation (and to a lesser extent GtR) I'm sure this is going to find plenty of time on my table in the years ahead.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: I really like the tight board that places you in direct conflict with you opponents. The rules are not easy to understand and at first you may miss some steps of forget to perform certain tasks, but once you clear it up the game is quite fun. Using cards to perform actions and build up your forces you must fight, mine or control spaces for points. You only need 0 points to win so you have to be aggressive which I like. Looking forward to playing this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This really does give you the feeling of a 4x in a small package. Just 108 cards and 13 ships per player and it plays in an hour or less. In that time you will explore the system, build fleets and fight battles, mine and refine minerals, trade goods, research technology and concoct intricate plans.

The cards do everything, they make up the board, the impulse (shared action bar), the players hands, minerals, technologies and plans. Plus you use the size of the card as a way of determining strength in battles or hits in sabotages. The possible combinations rack up once you've explored a fair bit but you don't want to sit back too long waiting for a big score as it doesn't take too many points before someone gets close to winning.

I especially like the explore mechanic which allows you to add the explored card to you hand and then chose a card in your hand to go down as that sector, this allows you a certain amount of control over the sectors you've uncovered. This doesn't mean that you own it as it's not easy to defend everywhere and movements come at a premium (you need to have some way of playing/activating a command card to do that).

This is one game that I will be trying to get to the table as often as possible.

This game has the crazy card combos of Chudyk's previous game, Innovation, with more different ways the cards can be used, but less variation in the actual card texts. This is layered on top of a space combat game with a spatial element. The key feature here is the "Impulse", which is a queue of cards that all players must add to and execute in order, forcing players to really think about what they put there.  I enjoyed the card combos and the many ways that cards can be used, but I wasn't a huge fan of the PvP combat bits or the player-enforced balance.

Rec'd via direct purchase from publisher, $25, June 12th, 2014. Solo play on June 15th. Initial reaction - going to like this, however my initial concern is that we choose to play Innovation instead of this. The space theme, while cool, may not be enough to get this to the table. Initial rating, a 7.5 (losing a point for the rulebook, which I find myself thumbing through constantly - for example, trying to figure out exactly when battles take place during your turn). [7/20/14]: after several solo plays, I feel very excited about this one. It feels very much like a 20-30 minute "4x" experience, I like how small the box is, setup time, and iconography. There are definitely going to be multiple approaches to victory, and the starting tech provides a very subtle approach to kicking off the game differently each time. I can also see some room for an expansion: variable game length, aliens that attack you as you pass through, larger map, wormholes, monoliths, new ship types?

[9/12/14]: Have played this 11 times now, all 2-player but one game. Today played two 2-p games with 4 sides, each of us taking two, with team rules. Fantastic! The game was not much longer than normal, and several new strategies appeared - including 2 on 1 elimination, and using your teammates cards with their Cruisers as cover. Fantastic!

Played a number of three player games in late 2016, which were enjoyable. Kind of feel like you can't take the game terribly seriously, but still enjoyable because it is just short enough.

RATING: 7
This game is a tough one to rate. I'd love to get more plays of it and I can see the potential. My first 2 games of this were extremely overwhelming. So much to learn/do and with actions on the impulse, actions on cards in space, actions in your plan and actions in your hand. This game overwhelms you quite quickly.

After bringing it back out again recently, I'd have to say that I'm much more impressed with it. I didn't feel like I was lost and felt more focused on things. I didn't even bother creating a plan.

One other thing I'd like to mention is that initially reading the rules, I found it quite tough to slog my way through. It wasn't hard to understand once it's on the table, but it wasn't easy. It felt quite disjointed. Upon re-reading it again after many, many months, it felt more natural, but only because I had a semblance of how to play it. Kind of reminded me of early FFG rulebooks.

RATING: 7
Pretty good 4x card game. Some similarities to Eminent Domain and Innovation. There are a lot of choices to be made. Some nice combos can be set up, though it seems that a player who can dominate and defend the most sector points each round is going to be tough to beat since they will score sector points on top of winning battles and defeating ships. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My initial reaction was love for the rules in general and the theme, but disappointment at the art and components. After more plays: The combat rules are somewhat obtuse -- you score points for every victory, so unintended kingmaking can occur for the player who successfully repels an attack. The fact that you can lay down any card when you reveal a new space makes it not feel much like exploring.

RATING: 8
Impulse is exactly what I’ve come to expect from Carl Chudyk: a dense, opaque, swingy ride. In some games these traits turn me off, but here (as in Glory to Rome and Innovation), it tweaks my brain in just the right way to bring me back for more. Impluse is a space-exploration and combat game in name, but mechanically, the game asks for players to create powerful combinations of cards. These happen on the map, thus incorporating a satisfying spatial element, in a public row of ever-changing cards, and in a personal row of cards that will be triggered for a one-time chain of events. Trying to balance all these pieces and grab on to one of the several ways to score points (the game is a race to 20 pts), is challenging and terrifying. My impression is that the game can play out very differently each time, so I’m looking forward to many more plays.

I love how much crazy stuff can happen in this game.  This game is notable for being the one I hated the most the first time I played it to going to one of my most beloved games of all time.  I love how many ways there are to take an action, none of them straightforward.  I love how many actions there are.  I love the unintuitive and mind bending events that can take place from such a simple stratum.  I love how many different ways the cards can be used.  I love the power of mining a pile of colors and taking a zillion actions all at once.  I love the tiny ships that are either useful but helpless or deadly but powerless.  Every game I have played has been entirely different.  How is it possible?  I love you Impulse.

A game I was not interested in playing but tried to stay positive. I haven't had the best results with Carl Chudyk's designs. It is a wonder how I love Innovation so much. This game has similarities to his others. Multi-use cards and different actions to activate and get your own strategies going. Little you can do since the cards you get are the ones you work with. Much too luck dependent for me- AND I LIKE LUCK. Way to much AP and we were only playing 3p. I really never want to play this game again. I had zero fun and I even won the game.

Eddig egyet játszottam vele, de nem érzek késztetést egy újabb játékra. Igaz, hogy nem én olvastam végig a szabályt, de láttam két ismertető videót is, amikből elsőre nem sikerült mindent tökéletesen felfogni.

Van benne jó elképzelés a lapok használatával kapcsolatban és tartalmaz stratégia mélységet is, de nagyjából ennyi jót lehet róla elmondani.

Az embernek rögtön olyan érzése van, mintha egy Kickstarteres játék lenne előtte és abból is valamiért a pnp-t kapta volna meg. A téma még jó is lehetne, de fekete, dizájn nélküli lapokról nem jön át semmi. Ráadásul a papír minősége is erősen kritizálható. A saját kartonunk és a pontozólap is a vicc kategóriáját súrolja. Az egészen a kis műanyagűrhajók sem javítanak, maximum annyit, hogy ne kizárólag kártyajátékként tekintsünk az Impulse-ra.

Tovább növeli a mókafaktort a szabálykönyvben említett tartozék, a dobozba "pakolt" "láthatatlan űrördög", amit persze hiába keresünk. Cserébe van egy köröm nagyságú Impulse jelző.

Kár a gyenge körítésért, a gyenge szabálykönyvért, a szerzőtől elvárt jóval nagyobb szerencsefaktorért, mert ebben a játékban több volt. Nem sok késztetést érzek egy újabb játékra.

One of my most-anticipated of the games I got for Christmas. I've played this 3 times now - the first was, inevitably, 2p against my wife early in 2015, which she didn't particularly enjoy. I wasn't sure how much I enjoyed it, but was certainly fascinating by the mechanics and wanted to play it several more times before coming to a conclusion. My next game was a 3p, much later (August I think?), which I really enjoyed and seemed to go down well with the other players. And in October I played it with 6, which I wasn't particularly keen to try (but there were 6 of us and no other 6p options which wouldn't have taken longer than the time we had available) - which, as I expected, had just far too much downtime to be really enjoyable. But I'm convinced I like the game - perhaps not quite as much as Glory to Rome and certainly not as much as Innovation, but definitely a worthy addition to Chudyk's pantheon of highly novel card games with multiple uses for each card. I think this game is best with 3 or 4, certainly not more.

played pre-release prototype.  That version was intriguing but had a LOT of rough edges, including very influential early game randomness and viable zero-interaction strategies.  High potential but to me the current state is almost unplayable.

Update: the published version fixed a few issues, but not the big ones.  There is way too much influential early game randomness.  When you get to the mid-game in a balanced position, it is very interesting, but too much can ruin the game before you get there.  The designer is brilliant, but I think he needs a strong developer to help him.

You can see the Innovation pedigree through and through. This however is a faster and less in your face chaotic game. Plenty of strategies to explore and good player interaction. Turns can run long sometimes - especially if you get a large number of plan cards with movement on them. Mainly for this reason I'd never want to play with more than three players again. Played three times back to back on the first night after it arrived and it was a great way to learn and speed up the game. Lots of laughs and really fun.

In an ever changing universe there's a raft of opportunities and options available to players who can formulate a long term plan, but be flexible enough to exploit short term opportunities that present themselves. Each player begins their turn by adding a card from their hand to an ever changing central row of communal orders. Then play one of your own technologies before running through and executing the four communal orders. Trading, plan future orders, mining, moving ships, drawing more cards... then, once you've done all that you might have some extra planned orders to carry out. Finish off by drawing two cards (if the generous ten card hand limit allows it). Phew, you're done. Now keep an eye on the other players, maybe defend a battle or three, and keep your brain engaged to plan your next move. There's never a dull moment in space exploration.

I'm sold. There's a few tweaks for the final production version - fleet wording and one of the green level three plan cards seems rather overpowered (which I hope is addressed), but it's got my cash for sure.

What a monster! 

After only three plays I can't really say anything specific about the game. It's crazy, there are great combos, powermoves, huge swings in VP and great comebacks. Everything that I love about a Chudyk game

I need to play it some more, but so far I'm loving it!rr

RATING: 5
You can tell that Impulse comes from the same designer as Glory to Rome and Innovation. It's another tableau building card game in the same vein, except in Impulse there's a spatial element to the tableau. As in Glory to Rome and Innovation, cards have several functions, even creating the board itself. There's the same sense of controlled chaos common to Chudyk's designs. Combos can get crazy.

The long combos can be a problem because there are a lot of options on each turn and several things to consider. My 2p games have played quickly enough, but I can see the potential for painful downtime. It'd bog down quickly with too many or the wrong players. 

This might have been mitigated by eliminating one or two action types. Is the Plan necessary? Is Research? Impulse is full of great ideas, but it's a bit overfull. Glory to Rome and Innovation are not simple games, but there's a unity to them. Impulse is more of a hodgepodge, like Innovation with its expansions. Unlike an expanded Innovation, there's less of an arc to the game than a flat early-to-mid game and a sudden spike at the end. It just ends.

Really enjoy this game, only downside is that some turns take way too long for a quick playing game like this. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game feels a lot like Innovation: the 4x game.  It is a card-driven 4x game.  Each of the cards does something different from building more ships to exploring new space areas to mining cards for gems which boost your other actions.  The namesake "impulse" is an area of cards that each player contributes to on their turn before doing all the actions in the impulse.  This offers neat decisions since what you add to the impulse you get to do but you also make available for your opponents to do.  The main reason I compare this game to Innovation is because of the absolute chaos in the game.  There are a ton of cards that all do different things and you have a lot of control over what makes it into the game but then other players are just going to add their own stuff to the game or use your stuff against you, etc.  It makes for a wild and crazy time and the whole game should only take 30-60 minutes, even with higher player counts.

Unlike Innovation I think this game might be more enjoyable with more than 2 players although there is something to be said about the 2-player game since the "impulse" cycles slower making the decisions on what to put in it even more difficult.  In the end it isn't nearly as good as Innovation, there are a lot of cards and they do a good variety of different things for such a small game that plays quickly but nowhere near the variety of Innovation.

I also have to make mention that the rulebook is horrendous.  Most of the rules are well written but the layout of the rulebook is insanely incomprehensible.  They introduce card layout before setup and then how to play the game without explaining what any of it means, then the end of game conditions (still not knowing what any of it means) THEN they explain the different game actions and terminology.  And throughout all of this the edges of every page have little rules blurbs, some with important clarifications in them ostensibly hidden.  Nobody has ever or would ever read a rulebook this way and it had me seriously baffled.  The rulebook almost feels like a prank because nobody would actually think it was a good idea to lay it out that way.

Like most Chudyk games, Impulse invites you to build an engine out of incredibly random, swingy components. It's very difficult to make a plan that will last more than a turn, so just take it as it comes and do whatever seems tactically correct. It just goes a little too long for a game that can swing so wildly.

RATING: 7.5
A game that needs at least two to three plays to start understanding the comboing, with one of the most atrocious rulebooks I've ever seen, still getting almost a 7 in general is a testament to its brilliance.

Have not explored this fully, expecting the rating to go up as did Innovation, one of Chudyks earlier designs (and in time a gaming favorite). Enjoy the exploration very much so far, but deducted a full point because of the rulebook. Had to download a fanmade rules summary of the geek and still checking that occasionally for rule specifics, as the rulebook is a worthless structured piece of garbarge.

Luckily, the game itself is excellent. For fans of intricate combo building and space warfaring.

RATING: 8
The mad genious Chudyk strikes back. I'm fascinated with how the same cards are used everywhere, and all the different ways to trigger actions. It plays quickly, but you get to do some crazy chaining and cool stuff. There are so many potential combos, but unlike Innovation, in this game you can send a fleet of cruisers to break that combo up. Lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure that I quite share the excitement of Chudyk games that others do, though Impulse was quite entertaining. Elegant it isn't with ten or so different actions on cards and terms that are barely explained on the reference cards, but it certainly felt that the choices you made and the actions you took had a significant impact on the outcome, even if the combat might be a little bullshit.

In summary; slightly mad, possibly not random but quite fun. Well worth further plays.

Its one of those issues with recent board games. This game could be quick, and it could be fun, but if I have to explain it to a new player, add on an hour to gameplay. It's too long with 6, super-swingy with 2, and absolutely dreadful to teach. And the presentation makes it hard to convince anyone new to play.

If I could play this another 5 times with 3 or 4 players, I think it could be fun. It requires investment. For now, it's in the category of unique but flawed genius.

RATING: 9.5
The most underrated of the Chudyk series.

Goes where very few 4X games dare tread- specifically, the realms of short playtimes and fresh, emergent gameplay mechanics.  This is the 4X game where the players can manipulate how much of each "X" you want to play with thanks to the very cool Impulse phase of the game.  Chudyk also rewires the cardplay he's so well-known for by adding thoughtful rules for movement, attacking and VP generation.   So cool.

Chudyk has done it again for me! I have been waiting for this game for over a year, and now that I have it my expectations are being met! Just like innovation and GtR, there is clever card play, multiple paths to victory, and each game plays out in a very different style. Add the fact that this is a mini 4X game, and I am sold!

RATING: 8
Cool game. I am a big 4X fan, and this game is able to give the feel of a 4X in a fraction of the time. That is both a bad and a good thing. It depends, I guess.Chudyk seems to be able to make his games feel similar. Momentum can shift in a heartbeat, and that self-assured victory can be snatched away. Also, the end game can accelerate very quickly, as some big combos are possible. It is a great game.

Another brilliant card design from Carl. It is a simple game with a horrible rulebook. Just ask someone to teach you the game. This is a 4X game with equal or more exhitment than other games that use 10 times more components. The Impulse action system is a gem of game design. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[thing=144239][/thing] is an interesting game: a true 4X (unlike others that are called this) which works inside a very reasonable time frame: around 45 to 75 minutes, when playing with 3 or 4 people.

[thing=144239][/thing] is filled with options: a big set of possible actions knitted around interaction between players (conflicts and what the others are doing and can do, considering minerals, techs and plans) and the state of the map (what the sectors do, what remains to be explored and the positioning of ships). There also also adjacent levels connected with the decision-making process, specially with preparation, involving the plan (a set of actions that can be build by the player and is only done by the player at a time of his choosing), minerals (which help boost actions) and even what to add to the impulse (the common set of actions), thinking about what you will do, in which order, and what you are giving to the others, and also is a way to prepare for combat (to defend or to attack).

It is a lot to ponder about, on each turn, giving loads of choices and paths to follow in order to obtain points and reach victory. A truly rich environment for decisions, smart plays and interaction.

One of the main problems of the game revolves around one of the pillars of the 4X genre: player elimination. Another, which bothers way more, and it happens way more often, is the downtime: even when playing in 3, wait for your turn can take a good chunk of the time and play experience, as, unlike in [thing=19857][/thing], you aren't involved in many turns of the others - the way the game proceeds is more in the vein of that of one of Chudyk's next design: [thing=175199][/thing], in which each players do a whole series of actions in their turn, then play proceeds to the next person. I much prefer the way [thing=19857][/thing] uses the actions, as it keeps turns shorter and everyone more involved, with the option of following and/or thinking; than that of [thing=175199][/thing] and, of course, [thing=144239][/thing], as it leads to longer turns, more downtime and increase the chance of severe AP, with more things to consider. Finally, there is a strong luck component in the drawing of cards and when activating several actions - but with minerals, is possible to increase the odds of getting things done.

In spite of these, and overall, [thing=144239][/thing] has lots of room for strategy, even if mixed with a big amount of tatical decisions - the end result demands more planning and good decisions than being lucky. [thing=144239][/thing] packs a lot in a tiny package, being true to the designer other works, using cards for multiple purposes and achieving much with just cards and a small number of components. I recommend it.

Update: I think my first impressions may be quite wrong; too many I correlate with have found much more joy in the action chaining... eager to try it again with a more open mind. 

Original impression: An idea that, for me, doesn't really make a game. I may be hasty. 

It lacks the unique cards & language driven combinatory powers of GtR and Innovation. It has the abstraction of making explosive action chaining, which is an interesting idea but just didn't grab me; there're too many richer environs for gaming, and for card mechanics there're better tableaus/combo & more interesting trick takers out there that shouldn't be bumped aside to explore this one. The little tech tree & plastic ships turned me off too, so the lack of aesthetics can't raise it either.

09/08/14 - I ended up trading this one away. Dropped my rating from a 7 to a 4. Noone I played this with really enjoyed it. The rulebook is really clunky and the wording on the cards is average at best. I quite liked the impulse track and the decisions around that. I didn't end up playing it enough to discover if there was an amazing game after the initial learning barrier. Oh well, I still have Innovation and Glory to Rome.

Suffers from Carl Chudyk rulebook. Could be good for a different crowd, but I found it much less fun than you would expect a "RoboRally meets worker placement" game to be.

a new Chudyk success! after being disappointed by Uchronia, this is an excellent game if you like Innovation, be sure to give it a try. 

EDIT: the 2p game is solid, I think it really shines with more players, be sure to gang on the leader as fast as possible, because the game can be won very fast if you manage to setup a good combo.

[+] fast paced, surprisingly short game, many choices and combos to discover, clever mechanic of the Impulse/Plan, cool components, the lack of artwork does not bother me and cards are very readable, small box with lots of game inside!
[-] like Innovation, you need a few plays to get all the rules, figure out the interactions and the rythm of the game; the battle system is a bit weird, I wish it was simpler (just draw cards equal to number of ship + play 1 card face down, highest symbol count wins / no need to match symbols/colors/etc.); there can (and probably will) be player elimination with larger group (5/6p), but it does not bother me that much since game is so short anyways.

Feels very much like a Carl Chudyk game.  He's a hot-and-cold designer for my taste, and this one is on the cold side.  It's admirable that this still manages to feel like a 4X game despite short gameplay (as long as you don't go over 4 players) and small box size.  But it's very dry, and there are lots of cards that can suddenly swing the game.  Combat is also kind of frustrating in this type of game -- your plan is working along great, then a few card draws can really mess you up, or be wildly beneficial.  If I want a rollicking ride of a Chudyk card game, I'll stick with [gameid=63888].

RATING: 6
Impulse is the same Carl Chudyk design we've all come to expect. Simple in execution, usually draw a card and play a card, with the complexity coming from the new card effect firing off in combination with the cards played on previous turns. This time, that basic concept is coupled with a sort of shared tableau, allowing even more card effects to fire off of each player's turn.

It's a solid game, a little more chaotic than Innovation and Glory to Rome, yet still very rewarding to someone who plans ahead and lays a foundation for a big turn. Unfortunately, it's probably too much to process for most folks, becoming more work than fun because of the sheer amount of options on any given turn. This is an AP nightmare, for those prone to it. Also the little plastic ships make it a bit less portable than it would be if it was a pure card game, factors that I think will hold it back from being a classic like Chudyk's previous efforts.

Big 4X space card game in a little box. This could double as a therapy game for fine motor skills and OCD to keep from fiddling with the cards and ships that keep getting bumped! The actions center around the impulse card play and trying to keep cards in your hand that match the impulse display. This might be a weak example, but it reminds me of timing like puerto rico roles to benefit more than the other players. Another trick to the game is combo's to get boosted actions.

Such a small game packs such a powerful punch; a little amount of components but tons of re-playability and very cognitive. With lots of options to think about each turn, the most efficient use of the cards and ship movements can win the day. Its only downfall is that a run of bad cards (successive cards lacking synergy) can hinder your progress for the whole game, however this could be mitigated to some degree by changing your game plan.

The first Chudyk game I've played, I now understand the reputation.  I felt so lost for most of the first game, but by the end it was making sense and I even came out as the winner.  The design really is clever - having the backs of the cards be un-explored space and the fronts being explored, the ships being transports or cruisers based on their orientation, etc.  Unfortunately, I don't have the right group to play this regularly, because I do think it would shine with repeated plays.

A really interesting action chaining with some of the wild swings of an Innovation or Glory to Rome.  It really captures the feel of larger 4x type games very nicely despite being such a card driven system.  Teaching the game still feels like a mess as does getting a grasp on the strategies... and if everyone is chaining their actions a lot there can be a lot of downtime between turns unless you are attacked... but if you like action chaining games (especially watching other people construct impressive chains) there is certainly an enjoyable game in here for you.

Played one learning game with my wife. It's a very crunchy game with several "gears" to the points engine. You create combos by leveraging the impulse, your own plan, and the movement of your transport ships to squeeze extra actions out.  Towards the end of our learning game, we started to see how mining compounds on itself to create a glut of extra "gems" that can be used to create very powerful card actions.  Tentatively rating this an 8 based on previous experience with Chudyk's games and my own level of enthusiasm.  I'll make changes in the coming months if necessary. [JUL 2014]

I've now played two games, a 3p and a 4p, and have bumped this up to a 9.  There was some conversation about this having too much Munchkin "I drew the right card at the right time", but that's true for any of the Chudyk games.  There's certainly some excellent room for strategy as you learn what each color means, what each card does well, which are best as techs versus impulse, how to plan for battle, and create combos that can build a large plan for an obscenely long series of actions. It really does start to click and moves along quite nicely once everyone has a grasp on the turn order.  The only small detriment is the downtime; you can't REALLY start planning for your next turn until the player before you has placed their impulse card.  Depending on the level of crunch in your interlocking combos, you may find yourself wanting to rewire your plan at the last minute and taking a longer than average turn.

RATING: 10
Innovation was kind of a flop for me.  Glory to Rome is excellent.  Impulse is golden!  A 4x game that employs some mechanisms that are similar to Glory to Rome.  It plays very well, with some good decision-making opportunities and room for strategy.

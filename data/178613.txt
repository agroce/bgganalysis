GAME: Star Trek: Five-Year Mission
RANK: 2283
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Star Trek: Five-Year Mission is an extremely simple cooperative dice game.  It has a few decisions in it, but they are pretty shallow decisions: what level of alert to draw, which color of dice to roll, which numbers to reroll, and where to allocate your dice.  Most of the time these decisions are obvious.

The game plays quickly, but there's almost nothing you can do on other players' turns to plan for your own, so I wouldn't recommend it at higher player counts.  It's easily playable with just two players, though I recommend each player plays 2 characters each.  My partner and I play it this way, and it works fine without needing any special house rules.

The game is easy to win and lacks a feeling of tension.  The method of increasing difficulty level suggested in the rulebook simply makes the game play longer, which potentially could cause the game to overstay its welcome.  You could instead lower the number of missions you can fail before losing, so if you find the game too easy but don't want to make it longer, that's something you could try.

Without the Star Trek theme, I wouldn't have given this game a second look.  The theme is present and well done within the confines of the game system, but it's far from giving a true Star Trek experience.

The components in the game are passable, but could have been better.  The artwork is simply stills from the original Star Trek series and Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the colors in the images feel muted and lacking in vibrancy.  The graphic design work is minimalist and not at all inspiring.  It honestly feels slapped together and rather amateurish.  The MSRP of $35 feels high, no doubt due to the cost of the license.

All in all, I have a hard time recommending the game.  If you're a die-hard Trek fan and looking for a light, quick filler, then you'll probably be satisfied with this game.  Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.

RATING: 6
Not a bad filler if pressing your luck with dice is your thing.  Give me dice and tell me to press my luck and I'm there, dude. This is not really Star Trek. ..."Khan! What do you want?" "Captain Kirk, my old friend ... I want you to roll 2 red dice that obtain 4-6, any die that is 6, and a yellow die that is 1 or 2."  This is kind of like Elder Sign somewhat.  The theme is pretty thin, but the character powers are pretty cool.  Not a lot to it, but its over quickly and it can be pretty tense.

A pleasant enough dice game.  Nothing really new, but nothing much to dislike either, apart from some monotony.  Pretty easy to understand and the theme was integrated some.  All in all, not bad.

RATING: 6
Light, fast dice-based cooperative game.  Problems present themselves to the crew through 3 "Alert Decks".  Those same problems are solved by rolling the necessary values for each.  Some of the problems have VP and move the crew towards winning.  On the other hand, an overaccumulation of unsolved crises will end in failure.  Pretty easy to win on the "Ensign" level.  Gamers who like tension should ratchet up the difficulty.  Not many hard decisions, either. This could be a welcome 'family game' with easy rules and straightforward mechanics (roll and match dice).  On the other hand, players looking for agonizing, pressure filled experiences might not find it here.

...:::Approved for solitaire:::...

Nice game in both gameplay and overall feeling, specially for dice lovers.
Can be easily played solo and with others and there are no problems if a player quits in the middle of the game.
The art is good for Star Trek lovers, but not so good for everybody else, as it has screenshots from the movies.

RATING: 6
This is a neat little dice-based coop game which is just as much fun to play solo (or with 2 players) each playing multiple character cards as it is with more people. The theme is a plus for me, but at the end of the day, it's just a lot of dice rolling and matching dice to cards (Blue, Yellow, Red alert cards which turn over every turn). The individual player card powers are interesting, but the special abilities granted for one-time use on the cards makes the symbology to keep track of a bit of a mess for such a light game. Worth a few plays, but maybe not as much staying power as other coops due to weaknesses.

Pretty vanilla, but I still enjoyed it. Nice player powers and cards are mildly evocative. Probably a bit too easy for most gamers, and the difficulty scaling rules are not great, to say the least (just increase the game length, making it more likely you'll have to face a dangerous combo of alerts). I suspect for my next game I'll just pull a number of the low-threat alerts from the deck. Anyway, this wasn't mind-blowing, but it was fun and it moves a long and it has some nice flavor.

Worst "Star Trek" game ever. An insult to fans & gamers and a denigration of the franchise. Classic example of tacked-on theme.  Nothing but dice-rolling to make specific combinations as revealed on cards. Roddenberry must be spinning in his grave. Please DO NOT BUY THIS. Let's send a message to CBS licensing to show respect for the franchise, the fans, and the gamers by keeping the "Star Trek" logo off of garbage like this.

I like rolling dice and this game has that.  I also like Star Trek.  The option to choose either classic or next generation characters and missions is a nice touch.  Based on which mission cards come up, game can either be an easy road to win, or a nailbiter.  
Plays solo as well, so don't look at the # of players.  You just play the characters.
My Trekkie wife, though, has begun to really dislike it as we haven't won in 5 attempts.

Fun cooperative dice allocation game with variable victory conditions to adjust difficulty. It can seem too easy if all rules are not followed (e.g., number of extra dice in pool and sequencing of actions and card effects). I am disappointed in the quality of the screen captures as they seem too dark and low resolution; i.e., sometimes looks as bad as VHS (480) quality.

Played a demo version at the local game store & it is quite fun. Between the individual roles you can take in the game which seem mostly different from the Original Series & Next Generation crews to pick from, the easy play of dice assignment & the game goes quick with a lot of diverse action from the cards. A lot of tension too with the lighter Elder Sign kind of gameplay especially when it adds in the timer on some alert missions or other alerts where communications is broken (and you can't speak to other crew members for planning though rules explanations or other non-game issues are fine).

Definitely worth getting for anyone wanting a good sci-fi and/or Star Trek game.

It looks like this will render Elder Sign obsolete on our table.  If we want a longer co-op horror game, we can play Eldritch Horror.  If we want a lighter co-op dice game, we can play Five-Year.

I'm a total trekkie and love dice and Co-op games.  This game has just the right amount of tension to be fun.  Easy to teach to non-gamers (a BIG consideration for me).  Only flaw is that it's quite easy to forget execution of a consequence on a card and then I feel like it wasn't a real win.  You will need to sleeve the cards as the black backs get scratched up as you slide them up. Lots of criticism that there can be turns with nothing to do if you roll poorly.  As I mainly play this solo, this isn't an issue for me.  I enjoy it!

RATING: 9
Cooperative game in which you need specific results on the dice to complete the requisite number of missions -- and lose if you fail five. What makes the game really work well is that each player is a crew member of the Enterprise, the dice are coloured blue, yellow and red... and, most importantly, other aspects from the series like Prime Directive and alerts come in as well. It's not heavy in theme (it's still a dice roller at heart) but there's enough there to make the game enjoyable.

PLUS: cooperative, interactive, use of theme
MEGA PLUS: player cards are both original series and Next Generation (one per side)
MINOR MINUS: still a dice roller

RATING: 8
2015-11-05: Initial rating is an 8, which I know I will likely downgrade to somewhere is the 7ish range. I'm a big fan of cooperative games (e.g. Forbidden Desert) and chucking dice games (e.g. Las Vegas), so this seems right up my alley. My game group really likes dice chucking games, but is less apt to enjoy games that involve a lot of stressful things to beat. So, this is a stretch for them, but the Star Trek theme is the clincher. We really enjoy ST, so, there you go.

I got a chance to play this tonight. Here's the thing: I don't normally like co-ops. This game, however, is great! It has a timer and sometimes you have to complete cards before time runs out.

Never would've given it a second look - or even a first - without the Star Trek theme pasted on, and it's certainly not my preferred weight of game, but I had fun playing it.

I've played a few times now, solo and 4-player. The game is solid, though not really a brain-burner. The art is mostly just screen captures from the TV shows, but I'm a Trek fan, so it all works for me. The hour glass timer is a little on the iffy side, but it usually works. Overall, I quite like the game. My family isn't quite sold on it yet, but they're willing to try a few more times.

I sadly vote this low. Its fun for me... but the game is too easy, and takes some work to get it to be fun.

Box Insert: This game is barely rated above Munchkin. They have a huge box and no dividers. I can at least somewhat under stand a big box, because they have the large player mats (which they could not really have shrunk), but the loose space is unacceptable. The dice or cards fly around because they only included a single sealable bag. 2/10

Hey, it's Star Trek... it had me at "Live long and prosper." We breezed through both games with no real risk, leading us to wonder if it's too easy but it was still fun to collaborate on the tasks.

Not nearly as bad as I expected, this is a perfectly acceptable die-rolling co-op with some cute tricks (the use of the sand timer for some alerts, for example). It feels zero percent like Star Trek and is a bit too long, but otherwise not bad at all.

The theme is paper-thin, but the game itself is actually pretty fun. It sort of feels like a faster-paced Elder Sign without the thematic elements therein. Just make sure to always play as though you are trying to achieve an admiral rating in order to give yourself a challenge.

Very mechanical and unexciting gameplay, complemented by Mayfair class component quality and rulebook. 

Astonishingly poorly implemented co-op part: There is very little need for any real co-operation (except for the Carcassonne-style 'put your die there!' location spotting), or even having more than one player in the game to begin with. The player powers and not rerolling on your turn aim to generate some player interaction but do not really succeed, making the entire game feel like a one player exercise.

Overall we had some fun with this but I don’t see it making the cut into my permanent collection. Given I have never seen a full episode of Star Trek (I did enjoy the new films) so the theme does not either appeal or repulse me. Some people really like the theme and some really don’t, I guess that is just Star Trek, but the theme could have been any space based show or just generic, so I am not really considering theme in my review, but others may. The game is fun to play but after a few plays it gets repetitive as you are mainly just rolling dice and don’t do much thinking on your turn. For this type of mechanic 45 minutes can get long and the difficulty levels don’t add any variety or mechanics, just more of the same. It is worth a try and if you are looking for a light cooperative game or love Star Trek you will likely enjoy it more then I.

The game has nice flow, with interesting choices to make but not too much downtime. I've marked off a bit for the separate but functionally identical cards for the original and next generation events; it adds to set up time without adding anything to the game play, and it seems like a missed opportunity.

I think this is a good game. Don't get all caught up trying to understand the rules - just start playing it and the rules become clear quickly.

This was a pretty average game. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special going on here. I really like Star Trek too, but this game has a pasted on theme that could pretty easily be rethemed to almost anything imaginable. Beyond that the decision making in this one is quite limited, but at least it plays relatively quickly. It is very reminiscent of Elder Sign to me and I didn't much like that one either. This stands out above that in at least one regard though to me, and that is this is a bit tougher of a game where failure is possible. Overall an alright game but I'll likely pass on playing it again.

Little touches ramp up the excitement in an otherwise random, dull-ish game. I'm thinking specifically of the timed missions, which added a fun sense of panic and urgency; and of the player abilities, which were varied and made choosing a character more interesting.
Too much of it felt completely out of our hands, and the missions were definitely not as thematic as they were trying to be (the dice colors corresponding to crew designations is neat, if completely superfluous).

I like the theme a lot and that probably goes a long way to making me enjoy it more than I would otherwise but I find the game to be really simple. It didn't seem very challenging or especially thematic and was VERY prone to alpha-gamers taking over the entire experience. I will definitely play it more though to see if later plays are more enjoyable.

I ended up joining a game in the Mayfair area before realizing it was a cooperative game! I decided to stick it out: maybe I don't hate co-ops after all?

Nope, I do. This one has a good theme, at least (Star Trek), but like all co-ops it's more a puzzle than a game. Here you're just rolling dice and applying them to pretty obvious choices, many times to the only choice for which your rolls meet the requirements! The main player decisions are which color dice to choose, and even that isn't too challenging -- you go where the missions take you, choosing the colors of dice needed to work towards finishing the worst of them or to score necessary VP. Beyond choosing color, you roll the dice and do your best with them. 

Eh, not for me, and not only because it's a co-op. Probably a 3 for me, maybe a 6-7 for people who don't mind co-ops?

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
Players each get a character with a unique power. Each turn, reveal a mission card (green/yellow/red alert = easy/medium/hard); these have varying sets of requirements to complete (specific colors/numbers of dice), and may impose a penalty on the players until solved (e.g., no talking, take damage = roll fewer dice, finish before sand timer runs out or mission fails). There are a bunch of d6 in the pool, in different colors. Grab any combo of dice (up to the number specified by your character; usually 5) and roll. Apply your d6 as able to the various missions. Unused d6 remain on your board and must be part of your allotment next turn. 

Missions are worth 0-2 VP; when completed, add them to the group's score pile. You win with 12 VP (or higher for a tougher game), or lose when there are too many incomplete missions in play.

This is not the nicest looking nor most advanced co-op game out there, but is certainly is fun.  It's a wild ride with lots of random things happening, but that makes it a really good time.  Much less predictable than Pandemic or other co-ops.  That makes this one a hit.  Also it's very easy to setup and plays quickly.  Simple rules make this perfect for people who are non-gamers.

If you don't like Star Trek, this will not be as great.  The pictures add to the narrative.

Star Trek: FYM strikes the perfect balance for a quick co-op.  It's fast and the tasks are plenty.  Players get to contribute SOMETHING on nearly every turn, even when they can't complete a task, because the game lets dice accumulate on the cards. It's a nice use of the franchise, too.

I'm sure it's full potential will go unrealized, much like it's namesake. Expansions (using the movies and other TV iterations), could be cool, but rather than leaving the player with a feeling of general disappointment (and unrealized potential), it should improve upon the genre/series, instead of exploiting it, as a marketing tool... just a suggestion.

The more I play this game, the more I like it. I thought it was entirely luck-based at first, but now I'm convinced that solid strategy (both with dice and with card selection) can trump some amount of poor dice rolling. The theme isn't overly engrossing, but I love the variety of characters and the unique mission cards for each crew.

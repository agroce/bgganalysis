I rate this game as a father who wants to play a game with his four-year-old girl. 

This is not my daughter's favorite game. She would likely rate it around 7, but not higher because she would not suggest it over something with more pink and princesses.

This is not my favorite game. For myself I would rate this a 4 or 5. I don't suggest playing it with adults only. 

Of my daughter's games though, this is so far my favorite. The turn options' complexity is just right for her. She loves coordinating the cooperative aspects and searching for cute things. I enjoy searching for pictures with her, and Richard Scary was one of my childhood favorite authors. 

When she and I want to play a game this is the game I will suggest to her. I will not turn down a game when she asks for it.

Love the six foot board.  It's beautiful and full of Busytown madness!  The game at it's heart is a spin and move, and that lowers it.  It is cooperative--everyone is trying to reach Picnic Island before the pigs eat all of lunch, and it is not easy.  There's a 1 in 4 chance that the pigs will eat every turn.  The search cards are well done, where every player searches for items on the board and marks them with magnifying glasses.  Then you all move based on the number you found in the time allotted.  Replability will suffer once the kids no where everything is located.  The kids heard the rules from their mom, then taught me in the evening.  For that reason alone, this is a great younger kid game.

RATING: 7
Initial rating:  well designed little game.  Simple enough for 3-4 year olds.  The 4 yr old enjoyed looking for things on the huge board.  We ended up playing this on the floor due to the size of the board.   Rating 7.

My son enjoys this, but he isn't really playing to win so much as trying to make everything happen exactly as he wants. Its a good "game-primer game" though.
Update: He's playing by the rules now, though he tends to wait until one of us finds an item and he puts the magnifying glass on it.

RATING: 6
Co-op children's game with a huge board.  Encourages activity and focus.  Keeps players engaged between turns.  Best use of game art as a play mechanic!  Childless adults might even get a single novelty play out of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Even though it's a spin the spinner and move your piece kind of game, it still end up being pretty fun, as the game is mostly about being able to spot things on the giant board. You'll often have to try finding as many balloons, potted plants, wrenches, etc as you can before a timer runs out. and the map is huge so it's a fun little activity.

The "game" part isn't that great, as it's just trying to race your cars down a long path before a game ending mechanism triggers, but hey, it's for three-year olds, and the searching part is still fun for everyone.

RATING: 8
Context: As a dad, I created this account solely for rating kids games as to how good they are to play with actual kids. It didn't seem right to evaluate them vs. the strategy games I rate on my main account, so if you look at this account's other ratings, they are completely ratings for children's games. Based on play with a 2.5 year-old:

Probably the most fun roll-and-move game I've played! The game is straight-forward... you spin a spinner, and some times move however many spaces it says. Some times, you spin a pig space, which causes them to eat a piece of food at a picnic that is waiting for you at the finish line. The goal is to get to the finish before the pigs eat all the food. Ok, so that would be incredibly boring if that's all it was...

However, you'll often spin a result that causes you to flip a card depicting some kind of object, like a kite, wrench, fire hydrant, etc. A timer is then flipped, and everyone scrambles to find as many of them as they can on the giant several foot long playing board full of detailed Richard Scarry scenery, in kind of a "Where's Waldo" activity. When the timer runs out, you total up how many were found (the game comes with bright orange magnifying glass pieces that you place on the board as you find things) and everyone gets to move a number of spaces equal to the number of things you found.

So, some games can be boring, if you rarely get to do the search activity, but the search activity is pretty fun, even though my 2.5 year-old generally doesn't search very hard; he's still learning! The deck of cards is also fairly large, so it takes a while before you cycle around to things you've already looked for. Even so, the board is so large, you often later find things that you'd missed the previous time.

RATING: 7
At two, this game is wonderful for the "Eye Found It" portion. Lots of detailed characters and objects to search for. Rest of the game (moving with the spinner, racing for the ferry) is better reserved for children of at least 3 years old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game for kids.

Edit: I've played this a few more times and have to admit that it is a well designed enjoyable co-op for young kids (3+). Better than Candy Land and Snakes and Ladders.

RATING: N/A
Christmas 2017, for V. 

Excellent children's game for 2-5 year olds which has a couple of mechanics which lift it above its competitors. Firstly, the periodic searching for visual details (the goldbug cards) which punctuates the game with excitement,  the ferry, which imposes a common win / lose condition, and the greedy pigs (which reminds me of the crow in Haba's First Orchard).

The board is beautiful, especially if you're a lifelong Richard Scarry fan, and huge.

A quality game, and very accessable for younger kids - our toddler (2-years-and-3-months-old) took to it immediately.

Great art, a delightfully giant board, cooperative play that kids can manage on their own, and simple game mechanisms including the central mechanism of finding objects on the board as fast as you can. All reasons this is a great success with every kid we've shown it to. Pretty much small-kid-gaming perfection.

It's an alternately themed Where's Waldo puzzle with a simple turn-taking, path-following game dropped on top of it. Find-the-thing puzzles are really fun with kids, and the board is really nice and huge, so this is totally worth it as a family game, but of course there's no depth here.

RATING: N/A
This is a child's first cooperative board game. While on the surface the game appears to be a roll and move game in reality it is a cooperative I Spy style game.  Kids love finding things in unison and progressing quickly through the board.  Highly recommended for young children ages 3-5.

As far as kids' games go, this is a winner!  The game will definitely end (unlike Candyland) when the players reach the end or the pigs eat all of the food; it's cooperative, so less fighting among the players; and it's more than just roll & move, as players have to look for things on the board.  You even get to make a couple of decisions about which path to follow.  One of the best games for small children.

RATING: 8
I can get my two year old somewhat interested in the game.  I'd say 3+ is real for good game play, and the little ones love it.  The aspect of the game that involves searching is hard enough that the game isn't that boring for adults.  I also like that is co-operative so my kids either all win or all lose.

Great game for young children. My almost 4 year old has worn out Candyland and this is a nice change up. It's cooperative, either everyone wins or no one wins, so it takes the "I WANT TO WIN" fever out of it, which depending on your child can be a good thing. 

It's fun and quick to play. Probably only 2-3 plays per sitting though.

Ignore whoever gave this game a 3?! There are few games that are more fun with a 4 & 6 year old, parents, and grandparents together. Who doesn't like "Where's Waldo?" type stuff with a time limit and bonuses for every item found!? The difficulty is also there so that if only one adult is playing, winning this coop game gets dicey. You don't get that in many kid games?! Note: I may have moved it from a 7.5 (personal preference) to an 8 because it is NOT another matching game and everyone enjoys playing it every time.

Favorite of C's. Pretty fun, but I've found that it's WAY too easy to lose... we roll those pigs WAY too often... I feel like one of those pig spaces on the spinner should have been another Goldbug as THAT is the fun of the game... Finding stuff on the game board.

Game worked very well when our son was 2-4 years old or so.  It's so massive on the floor it really blew his mind and it's a cute setup with the little spyglasses, figures, ferry and all that.

The game wore off about the same time for us as it did for our son so we've moved onto other things but this was definitely a game we enjoyed having had in our collection.

This would be a 9 if the bug "slices" on the spinner were larger. That's the most entertaining aspect of the game, and in our first play we only got to do it twice.

Apart from that, it's a great game. The huge board is fantastic and fun to look at, and the components are quite nice overall. Our daughter (almost three) got worried that the pigs would eat all of our food, liked finding things on the board, and had a good time.

I played this with a 3 year old I am tutoring. It teaches basic numbers, turn taking, and team work. It has a neat mechanic where everyone must find items in the board artwork.

Little Fish the Younger received this as a birthday gift last week and it was a huge hit with him and his brother. The game is one of the better children's co-ops I've seen and with the excellent components, fun gameplay and great replayability it's one that I can see us getting a fair bit of use from in the years to come.

Rated as a kids game.

You might want to play this one on the floor. A bit gimmicky board is pretty huge. Also it is a bit easier for kids try to find stuff from board on floor. Cooperative game for kids/adults that is pretty fun (for kids). Its pretty much roll & move only rolling is done by wheel of fortune -thingy to the finish before timer runs out. Cooperative part is when every now and then is to search for some things hidden on the board (this is reason why it's soo big) and everyone will move that many steps as was the total number of things found. The searching part was most fun but if you play a lot of this game then 20 (or so) cards will of course come pretty often and you just memorize where most things are. Not sure how big minus this is. Kids enjoyed a lot and finding stuff was fun (at least when you didn't know where they are).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one of the best games you can play with a 2 year old. It'll get a bit old when you've gone through all the gold bug cards once or twice but that will take a long time-- long enough for them to develop into more complicated games.

Highly recommended for young kids (less than 3) as it is easy for them to search for stuff and it is a cooperative game. Although I usually have to set limits for both kids in terms of the area in which they can search for. Else they end up tripping over game components and each other as they rush around the board.

Surprised how well this is gone down with my 4yo son, playing 3 times in the first day!! I know it isn't the marketing as we really haven't read/seen anything about the books/TV series.

So I think it is really because firstly my son realises it is roads and cars, picking up later the concept of all of us getting across on the ferry before the pigs eat all the picnic. So the hook here is the recognizable narrative, as even when finishing the first game, my son was happy just moving the cars and the ferry about, acting out any dialogue applicable to the setting, before the cars starting flying in the air (an incentive to get the Busy Airport game). The gamey and interesting part of the design - looking for matching icons under time pressure - hasn't become a major part of play yet.

Interessante mecanismo, componentes estonteantes e um tabuleiro megalomano, embora num jogo sem grande fidelidade nem replayhability, pois numa série os jogadores podem ter muitos turnos e noutra quase não os terem, além de que ao fim de alguns jogos já se decorou a posição dos objetos a procurar... Devia ter 12 lupas em vez de 10 e bastava o tabuleiro ser dupla face e já a replayhability estaria resolvida, ou seja, é um jogo agradável, mas podia ser muito melhor facilmente!

I had low expectations for this game, and they were greatly surpassed. Really fun cooperative game for kids, easy to learn, with a great deal of replayability. You're not likely to find a better cooperative game you can play with a 3-year-old. And who doesn't like Richard Scarry?

My daughter loves this game and the artwork is brilliant, just like I remember the books from when I was a kid.

Great for the age range. Boring for adults, but I don't like co-op games.

How to add frustration & annoyance into a game for small children? Use a spinner rather than a die.
The other issue with this game is the size. Too big for most tables, this leads to small feet walking on the board & knocking things.

Once you get past these two hurdles, it becomes a decent kids game of finding things & racing against the clock (or pigs)

Great game for kids but if you play it enough, it gets dull fast because clever kids will start to memorize where all the hidden objects are located.

If you have young kids and they like I Spy books at all they will love this game. And it's even kind of fun for parents to play along.

Rating applies to playing with kids.  The best part of the game is the giant game board with all the little details that are a Richard Scarry trademark.  Finding specific objects among those little details are also part of the game play.  Game play is cooperative which is a nice twist among kid games.  The downside of the game is that the board is so big that the game needs to be played on the floor; the kids don't mind, but it's not my preferred gaming stance.

Great game for kids.  I love that it has the added tension of the food being eaten as well as the searching sub-game.  Makes it much more enjoyable than a simple roll and move and my daughter loves it.  She especially loves when the the pig's eat a piece of food.  She thinks it's hilarious.

We play with a lego dice because the blue space on the spinner is too small.

My son is 4, and is charmed with the board, spinner, and ferry. Thrifted $2.

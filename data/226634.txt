I had fun with the one play of this, although it's definitely a group dependent game. It sort of mashes up Resistance and BSG, and I don't think it's better than either of those games (and is quite longer than Resistance), but these games are naturally fun, so I enjoyed it.

just played it with a group of friends who are not board gamers and they loved it. The growing paranoia through out the game is great along with the table talk and accusations.

Storage box is good quality but cards are flimsy.  I am afraid they will not survive if this game is played several times.  I could sleeve them but then they will not fit back into the box insert.

Game was easy to teach taking just a few minutes to explain to new players.  Mechanics worked well on my first 7 player game.  Everyone enjoyed the game.  Group felt it was much better then Resistance and Dead of Winter.  I am looking forward to playing again.

This game has excellent, evocative moments that nail the themes of its influence. But it gets in its own way far too often to really produce a satisfying experience. At any moment of tension, the rules themselves look to undercut the proceedings and instead inject randomness in an awkward way. 

It feels as though it wants hand management to be a thing, but it's not. You refill your cards and have no say over what you draw. Who knows if you'll need a flashlight, fire extinguisher, or copper wire down the line. So you just redraw and hope for the best.

Know who the imitation is? Great, either the game forces you to bring every single player on the mission (and surprise, it's sabotaged), or it gives you a choice and the outed imitation does nothing for large chunks of the game. 

It also fails to clearly define what you can and cannot say, and if the captain on the mission seriously grills the participants asking what they put into the pool of cards, it's trivial to catch an imitation.

The design's simply devoid of clever mechanisms but it's halfway there. Burning someone with the flamethrower is great. The group fighting a Thing is satisfying. The scavenger hunt to progress even works fairly well for yet another random element in the game.

Based on 1 play with 8 players:

Well, would you look at that! A licensed game that isn't just total garbage. Color me surprised.

A blend of some very familiar mechanics, with some improvements and some drawbacks. The Resistance's mission system makes an appearance with a much-needed addition: mission requirements that force the mission leader to switch up the team.

As for the drawbacks... the bad guys are just screwed when they're revealed. I would love to have seen some perks for revealed traitors more in line with other games in the genre - and frankly, it would be more accurate to the film. As it is, it's the game's biggest oversight. This is compounded by the fact that, unlike games like Secret Hitler or Dark Moon, good guys are rarely forced to do bad things. It's easier to spot a baddie in The Thing, and then easy to exclude them from the rest of the game. Blah. This is mitigated somewhat by the ratio of Things-to-humans, but it's hardly elegant design.

Our play went pretty smoothly because we identified 2/3rds of the baddies quickly, but I could see this having the tendency to drag when there's real intrigue. Considering the fact that the games can skew toward the too-straightforward ("John's the traitor, don't take him on missions anymore"), it's hard to imagine wanting to play this for 2 hours when you could play ~4-6 games of Secret Hitler in an hour.

For a lot of my first play of The Thing, I was sitting around clueless as a human and wondering if I was even going to be able to really deduce anyone's identity. Things picked up and got fun at the end once the flamethrowers came out, but I'm still worried that Things slowplaying as pseudo human-sympathizers could be an unfun but optimal strategy. I can't see this ever becoming my favorite social deduction game, even though I really like the John Carpenter movie and had the choicest quotes from it running through my head while I was playing the game.

It is the start of the bleak, desolate Antarctic winter when a group of NSF researchers manning the claustrophobic, isolated U.S. Outpost 31 comes into contact with a hostile extraterrestrial lifeform. Bent on assimilating Earth's native species, this being infiltrates the facility - creating a perfect imitation of one of the Outpost 31 crew. The staff frantically beign a sweep of the base, desperate to purge this alien infection before escaping to warn McMurdo Station that somewhere, out there in the frigid darkness, something horrible is waiting.

In The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31, relive John Carpenter's sci-fi cult classic as a hidden identity game designed to push you to the edge. Play as one of a dozen characters including helicopter pilot MacReady, mechanic Childs, or station manager Garry. Face sabotage and infection as you investigate the facility - gather gear, battle The Thing, expose any imitations among you, and escape Outpost 31!

Tension mounts and paranoia ensues as you question who you can trust in the ultimate race to save humanity.

This is perhaps a faster and easier version of Battlestar Galactica.  It has strong elements of that game combines with a little bit of The Resistance.

RATING: 7
This game does a great job of recreating the tension and atmosphere of the John carpenter's masterpiece, THE THING. If you are a fan of that movie, then this is a must play, but it may not be as effective for those who hold no investment in the film. The traitor mechanic is good, but its honestly a bit broken with the way table talk is conducted. All in all, I love the movie and this game is a lot of fun because its theme is so string; a couple well thought out house rules should fix some of the imbalances in game play.

Want to like it more than I do.  Unbalanced and susceptible to frustrating card draws for small player counts (4-5), seems to come into its own in 6-7 range, when you can get that many to the table.  Board and bits just awesome, as is table talk when paranoia starts running wild.  Main mechanics very elegant, but a few too many fiddly variations and corner cases bring things down a bit.

All that said, TOTALLY nails the Carpenter classic theme.  Totally.

2018-01-16 - I wanted to like this game so much. I love the movie, and have wanted a good board game version. I even had some fun while playing it. There's no good reason for the infected players to behave differently, though, which makes the end game feel random, and makes the paranoia toothless.

RATING: 7.25
An enjoyable experience with 4. Felt like we were fighting the game more than the person playing as the imitation, which is typical for coop and semi-coop games. to early to say how well balanced it is, but from my experience, the 'traitor' usually has an advantage and I suspect this is no different. The game inspires me to want to watch the movies!

Played with 6 players. Much more enjoyable game. Still feel there isn't enough interaction to out the imitation players during the 3 phases. Sitting back and waiting for the chopper seems like the best solution for the imitation.

I play tested this game at GEN CON 50. While the mechanic is good, the game pieces and board are if low quality. There are no pictures of the characters or The Thing itself from the movie. The equipment drawings are crude and overall the game is not worth the price. 

The Thing is one of my favorite movies. When I play McCready, I want a picture of Kurt Russell on my character card. All you have are hand drawn sketches. Apparently there was no agreement with Universal Studios to use scenes from the movie. This game could be so much better. I would skip it until someone does a better job next time.

Early Christmas present from the wife. Love the movie from 1982 and from what it looks like, it's essentially the movie in board game form.

First round was a bit rough as some of the rules weren't explained enough, so we sought out some videos. Sadly, they were lacking and the ones we found were just awful. One was a first playthrough with the participants constantly referring to the rules while the other had a person who had no interest in the game and nothing was explained as they went along. After finding one from G&S, we decided to just give it a whirl and check the interwebz for anything we weren't sure of.

While we were not successful, we found the game entertaining with some "pandemic-y" elements to it. Want to give it a few more plays and go from there.

This is an enjoyable hidden traitor game, best played with 8 players. On the continuum [simple to complex] of The Resistance, Dead of Winter, and Battlestar Galactica, I'd put this between the Resistance and Dead of Winter. I think where this game excels above DoW and BSG is that it shines with 8 players and offers much more complexity than the Resistance for a group of that size. But if your game group is only 5 players, stick to BSG or DoW.

RATING: 4
Agree with SALLstice's comment. The infected has everything to gain by keeping it cool and escaping in the helicopter at the end. There is really little to be gained from the infected to sabotage and a lot to win by keeping it cool, play along and escape in the end without there being any way for the humans to know who is infected and not.

[microbadge=5792][microbadge=5389][microbadge=2135]

A sprawling and large social deduction game mixed with card management and strategy.  It seems a little simpler and probably inferior to the standard-setting Battlestar Galactica, but it does play with a lot more players out of the box.  It also does a really good job of evoking the theme of the brilliant 1982 film.  Great production all around.

Got a chance to play this a few times over the past weekend, and liked it more than I expected to. I'm a huge fan of the movie, and the game does a pretty good job of capturing that atmosphere and tension. It's a fairly straightforward hidden identity game, and functions a lot like The Resistance or Shadows Over Camelot.

Overall, it was entertaining and strategic, with deduction of players' identities seeming to be the most important factor in winning and losing the game. I do wish there was some kind of mechanic controlled by the "Imitation" players to secretly "infect" the human players, rather than a scaling randomized infection.

RATING: 8
Fans of the John Carpenter classic remake form the 1980s are in for a treat. Every member of the team from Outpost 31 is brought to miniature form and even get their own character cards. With a team of 5-8 people, explore through 3 sectors, rotating the role of captain and seeking out objective tokens. Each mission requires participating members to submit cards from their secret supply. Sounds easy enough? It would be so except... 1 or more of your team may not be human. 

I have to say, I knew from the moment I heard about how this game played that I was going to enjoy it, but what I didn't expect was how much my family loved it too! Ages from 11 through to 70+ all thoroughly lost themselves in this immersive and talk-based game. 

The mechanics of the cards and the dice are very straightforward, luckily human nature is not so simple. The players really throw themselves into the game, and as infection spreads, so too does the suspicion. People you trusted from the beginning are now acting unusual, and the card pool that was meant to have 3 knives to fulfill an objective only has 1. Tension mounts, suspicion grows and accusations are thrown in this rollicking roller coaster of a game!

The more players the better and the most difficult thing about this game is getting a group big enough to play it.

I'd highly recommend setting an evening aside, stock up on supplies, gather round and get ready to trust no one as you play through Infection at Outpost 31.

A fine game. The theme and IP are excellent. It is difficult to determine the Infected player(s) for certain. My only issue might be the constant table talk about which cards each player intends to play prior to an investigation. The ordering of these little mini-interrogations do much to determine if the infected is discovered. Compares to Dark Moon.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty good for a social deduction game, especially considering I normally hate social deduction games! A little heavy on the RNG - cards and dice, although the game does a pretty good job of trying to mitigate this with cycling cards and player/item powers to improve rolls.

Adds more to the standard "Resistance" format. Having to search the rooms, requiring certain players to go on the missions and finding items throughout are great additions.

However, the game is certainly designed in such a way as to encourage the Thing to stay hidden throughout the whole game. There is little to be gained for the Thing by sabotaging the missions and raising suspicion. I think the game would play better without the ability for The Thing to be able to escape on the helicopter. I understand it's thematic, but it makes it too enticing for the Thing to want to do nothing all game, in the hopes of escaping.

Battlestar Galactica in about an hour. It has a similar "send a group on a mission, play a card to influence said mission, pass/fail the mission" turn flow. 

Not my favorite lineage of games. I like this one better than BSG, mostly because it's shorter, hence I'm giving it a 5.5 rather than a 5. 

This one seems very difficult for the humans to succeed. It is very easy for the imitations to sway the mission without showing their hand. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Terrible. Everything about this game is terrible. I don't think the designer has even played a board game in the last 30 years. There's little more to this game than rolling dice and hoping you rolled good enough. Sometimes you draw a card and hope you drew good enough.

Components are terrible, especially the miniatures, which are about the same quality as dollar-store plastic army men.

Graphic design is awful. Aside from the box, every bit of art in the game is bland and ugly.

And the price... $60 for the basic version and $120 for the "exclusive" edition! You must be kidding... For that extra $60 you get alternate box art and 2 additional plastic army men.

I've followed this game since it was announced, I am beyond disappointed. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of my all time favorite movies...

I'm offended this game exists. It's nothing more than a lazy attempt to cash in on a known property.

Check out "Dark Moon" instead.

Great game, very true to film.

While it’s true with the current rules it’s easy for the Thing to make it out to the end by behaving like a human, it’s an easy fix by requiring that players who draw the Thing must sabotage whenever possible.

Another rule we changed is that team members should only state whether they should be part of the team or not, and not state which specific card they’ll give. This allows more opportunity for the Thing to sabotage players while still allowing other players the opportunity to deduce who’s infected. Only exception is players could state if they had a flashlight or fire extinguisher.

By changing those two rules we had an absolute blast playing this game down to the last second and a great discussion afterwards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun gameplay (like a souped up Resistance, but lighter/quicker than Dead of WInter or BSG), captures the paranoia and feel of the film well, It does require some very direct lying, as people can divulge what they contributed to a mission and at least one person will know you are lying as an Imitation, unlike some other social deduction gaes where there is more room for doubt. But needs a high play count--trying at 4 with everyone on most all missions was not that interesting, think it will shine at 6+.

Infection at Outpost 31 admirably captures the paranoid energy of The Thing, though it's sadly undermined by a sloppy card economy that robs its antagonists of their most interesting options.

Stunning game! Brilliant mix of paranoia and teamwork. It's pretty tough though and a win for the regular human players is quite a struggle. The miniatures are directly relative to the 1982 film's characters but I feel they are not quite as well made or detailed as they could have been. You need lots of players to get the proper group dynamics to work... or to start crumbling away into mayhem!

Mondo Limited Edition w/Extended Play & two additional characters: The Norwegian & The Palmer-thing. Fun stuff, yo!
Ultimately, this is inductive Clue. The "imitations" definitely have a leg-up on this game but then that's fairly on par w/ the movie, which boasts one the most satisfying lacks of closure ever put on the big silver. The artwork, and design of this game is extremely joy inducing to anyone who loves the movie. Having read the short story the movie is based on, & the OTHER two movies (Howard Hawks & that silly thing that even Mary E. Winsted couldn't save), I have to admit there are elements here that appear to me to be influenced by these other sources, to some degree. And I think that's awesome. These guys really did their homework. Frankly, this may not get played a bunch, but I really do enjoy basking in its icy expanse.

Very fun hidden agenda/betrayer type of game. Reminds me a lot of a lighter version of Dead of Winter with far less fiddly rules. I think the game captures the feel of the movie quite well.

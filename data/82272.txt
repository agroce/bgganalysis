Great 2 Player 18XX abstraction.  Really gives you the feel of an 18XX game with the Stock Market and train rush.  Game time is definitely much more than the indicated 45 mins.  Probably closer the 90 mins.

After reading the heated "normal people vs. 18xx people" thread on the RB page (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/577268/warning-do-not-buy-this-game-unless-the-rulebook), I don't think this is the train/economy game for me. Or any 18xx, even. Sheesh.

RATING: 6
Played a few times and was fun at first but felt a bit shallow after getting to know it, the hook of 18xx is the grand combination of lots of small effects, this is hard to simulate in such a small package. Having said that it worked well and I liked the mechanic of buy/hold actions so you had to balance what you wanted to buy with what you wanted to keep.

18xx minus the board and track laying.  That's a more significant loss than I'd imagined; the railway companies become quite abstract.  You barely register the name of a company, it's just a "5".  In fact, the decision to turn the railway companies of 18xx into holding companies with jokey names and the trains into railway companies (that become obsolete?) strikes me as a thematic mis-step.

Anyhow, the game revolves entirely around share dealing and the "train" crises familiar from 18xx.  While those crises generate tough decisions, I find the share dealing rather less interesting because there are just two players at the table.  The fiddle of placing track tiles is gone, but Railroad Barons is as calculation-heavy as its parent games. It also retains an anticlimactic endgame where there is nothing left to do except collect revenue.  Not a bad game, but hard to escape a feeling that it could have been so much better.

The rules in the box are terrible.  Download the second edition set and you'll stand a chance of understanding how to play.  Production quality is mixed.  The cards are of a reasonable standard, but the share track comes in two, flimsy parts and you'll have to find your own priority deal marker.  Despite a surfeit of browny yellows and yellowy browns, I found the illustrations on the cards quite pleasing.

Provisional rating, I need to play it more. 

18xx abstracted to a card game, instead of running companies you run a holding company, instead of buying trains and laying track to generate revenue you buy train companies (that go obsolete ... hmm, bit of theme stretch there).

I don't think the claimed 45 minute play time is realistic - you have quite a bit to think about and calculate each turn. ORs although much simpler than an 18xx OR still has the work out the dividend and pay it out calcuation steps.

Downsides? Horrendously bad rulebook - I know 18xx and I was struggling, also some rules left out of the english one (most notable you can buy railways with cash from hand, but it is not a requirement you do so). Stock market is rather static (usually shares go up or stay where they are, this is not 1830).

No track building (obviously) - so for those who love the stock market or love track building you're going to have to play a 18xx title. For those who want the feel of 18xx for 2 in a relatively quick playtime it's really worth a look, if you can get past the rules.

RATING: 5
Nice simulation of an 18XX without a board.  Game clocked in right at 90 minutes.  Definitely could see the time decreasing with repeated plays, but probably not to 45 minutes.  Amanda said she liked it more than normal 18XX since she didn't have to deal with track laying.  There's definitely some interesting decisions to make vis a vis parring low vs. high, rushing the trains, and choosing the privates.  Not sure it has a lot of replayability but probably 3- 5 plays with the same person.  Well worth the ~25 I spent.

RATING: 7
Maybe a little bit of an optimistic rating after just one play, but I liked this quite a bit. I always complain about 18xx derivative games being unable to resist overwrought chrome and complexity, but Railroad Barons is a really clever streamlining and reduction to just the core things that usually make 18xx game interesting: portfolio evaluation and managing obsolescence. I think Ohley and Lookout have done a really good job of making an interesting, compact, and fast 2-player game that captures the good stuff of the 18xx system. I'd be interested to see if this could be extended to 3 or 4 players (it's not totally clear to me that it can be, actually, but it would be great if it could).

The game does go on a little bit too long. The 45 minute estimate is *very* optimistic, figure at least 90 your first time through. I don't object to this as much as you might think; 18xx games traditionally need to run a number of relatively uninteresting last ORs so that the last, biggest trains have a chance to pay out. It works for me, but an iPad version that could make the endgame cleaner to play would be great.

The rules in the box really are horrendous though (horrendous meaning, you can't actually use them to play). You'll need to get the updated ones from Lookout's website.

All in all, it's a great 18XX for 2 player game. It lacks of route building of course, but compacted more into company (holding in this game) port folio (like any 1825 branch) and train (railroad in this game) management. And like any other 18XX, there's a great deal of learning curve to understand the strategy.

- 1D stock market
- No route, just fixed revenue
- Interesting bidding of privates (Investor in this game)
- Unusual shares certificate
- Many optional train.

Players invest in holdings - companies that acquire railroads and run them to profit their investors.  Nice re-implementation of an 18xx train game, minus the mapboard and track tiles.  What we have is the investment and rolling stock component of the game - buy shares and equipment, and run it for profit, increasing your portfolio value.  A lot of standard 18xx stuff is here - stock rounds, followed by operating rounds, rusting trains (or rather railroad companies here), paying out or holding profits for reinvestment.  Good, solid game that retains the feel of 18xx in a fraction of the playing time.  Problems - a little anticlimactic once the railroad companies were gone, you just run and payout for four or five turns until the end of the game.  Other than that, good.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good simplification of 18XX, retaining the stock market manipulation as well as the shifting of railroads (read: trains) from holding companies to holding companies (read: railroads).

Fast playing, simple to explain once you've played it once and clicks quickly if you've played a few 18XX.

Recommended, especially when you want your 18xx fix and don't have the time/players.

Just the stock market portion of an 18xx game, really.  Abstract simulation of train income, with the stock round allowing the acquisition of stock.  A couple plays to get a feel of the game, with players familiar with the rules, the game appears to be played quickly.  Have yet to give it a full go.  Much more playable than a full 18xx game with my 10 year old son, due to shorter duration and simplicity.  It does have a good '18xx feel'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Has a lot of the feel of an 18XX game, given that it has no map.  Among the 18XX games, it seems to be more like an 1825 type game than any other type.  But it didn't have much appeal for me, even though it provides an option for 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Railroad Barons distills the 18xx system into a short (for the system) card game for two. The remaining stock market part manages to mimic the original experience rather better than expected, including all the calculations that entails. The missing track building part, however, changes the dynamics quite a bit.

"Trains" always operate at maximum capacity which makes having more trains generally more desirable, thereby accelerating the train rush. On the other hand, you can always buy new trains out of pocket, and since they collect perfectly predictable revenues that happens rather frequently and shuffling trains between companies becomes rather less important.

I don't think 18xx is at its best with only 2 players, but Railroad Barons is a nice way to get your feet wet without having to spend an entire day.

RATING: 5
Ok, that was my first play of an 18xx. The genre might be too maths-heavy for me. Chicago Express is just about my limit, though I'll give RB another try. Until then, my first impression stands: stimulating and extremely interesting as a system (we keep talking about it), but possibly not my kind of game.

Second game the next day. Definitely better. Especially bidding for Privates is exciting. I find an endgame with a calculator  lacking from the storytelling perspective, though.

RATING: 6.5
I made it myself. Now to figure out the right way to play it.

Update: Three plays now. Very impressive distillation of 18xx. Sadly, the unclimactic 18xx endgame remains, with the last 6 or so OR being a run-the-numbers bank grind. If players become adept at recognizing the eventual outcome, perhaps conceding will be the normal finish and doing that grunt work will be unnecessary. In this way, the advertised playtime of 45 min might actually be achievable.  

Update: Another play, still fascinating. The game can come down to one key midgame decision. However, with experienced players, I could see every decision prior to that One Key one being still very key. Wish there were an electronic version of this -- with automatic bookkeeping, games could be maybe 20 minutes.

Opinion: not a bad implementation of an 18XX for 2 players, you forfeit the construction on the map, and focus only on the shares part of an 18XX. For me, you miss one nice part of these kind of games, I love the economic part, but the construction is really important.
Probably too long for what it is, and have probably the problem of a run away leader. Could play it some other time, but I doubt I will suggest it

I rated over 450 Games (incl. expansions) and this means I played it at least once (meaning I understood the rules). This is my first "1" rating, as I read the rules several times but still had no clue on how actually play this game. It is just before writing this comment I saw other comments here on BGG complaining about poorly written rules of this game, so I am at least in good company. You can download revised rules, that's ok, but then still: such an easy game should be playable right out of the box! If not, the game company has to accept my lowest rating for their failure.

An interesting distillation of the train rush portion of an 18xx game into card game format. Firstly, ignore the rules that come in the box and download the latest version from the Lookout Games website, they're essential. It's perhaps a shame that the game is (admittedly loosely) set in the USA, as it's much closer to 1829 in style than 1830. The stock market really is on a par with that in Poseidon. It's also a little too easy to get a permanent train, as the cheapest '8' train costs just $400. Even if you run the final rounds on paper, this is a 90 minute game, but it doesn't feel like it as there's very little down time. Another very creditable achievement for Helmut Ohley in his steadily growing line of 18xx games.

18xx cardgame for 2 players that plays in an hour?

Hmm apparently not, one key aspect is missing (well something had to give) but also reports say closer to 90 mins which still not bad for 18xx game. Replay might be suspect and overall it might be calculation over gameplay (or at least feel that way) especially at the endgame which also has limited things to do apparently, might only be a 6 or 7 for me off the wishlist.

Railroad Barons somehow manages to turn 18xx into a 2-player, 90-minute card game without seeming totally ridiculous.  The heart of the game is around managing your deltas relative to the other player; I suspect the usual game state between two players playing well will be that one player holds directorships in three companies but with smaller deltas over the player who holds two directorships.

Because of the limited number of companies Railroad Barons seems to be mostly tactical.  I don't think there are very many distinct strategies; it's all about execution.  For a game of this scale that's just fine.

A very good 18xx "quick fix."  I expect to get 5 plays out of this title.

RATING: 7
Finally I understood how it is possible to play this game in 1 hour: one player must takes the investor who provides the 40% of the green holding and a level 2 railroad company. In the first stock round, one of the players must buy at least an addicional 10% of that holding to activate it with the amount of $1000 as initial capital. After that, in all operations rounds the director must choose to pay dividends, never divert into the holding's treasure, and its share value marker will take 14 turns (7 stock turns) to reach the higher value. The director must invest the initial capital of the holding to buy the new railroad companies: for instance 3 trains level 2, 4 and 6, or 2 trains level 3 and 8.

Railroad Barons really is the stock market aspect of 18xx condensed into a two hours two players affair. Good to get a grip on the share dealing and wheeling as well as insight into the pros and cons of 18xx without having to invest the better half of a day. Calculations are almost as intensive as in full 18xx. Skipping the track building and station markers makes Railroad Barons a lot more accessible than is usual for this genre. Good but not something for every week and limited by being two-player only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a clean little game that really captures the spirit of market competition and obsolescense that we like in 18xx. I don't think that 2-player is the best venue for these sorts of competition, and the play time seems to drag. It's well designed but this isn't my sweet spot for a 2-player experience.

Utterly unplayable in the condition it is sold in. The rules are totally unintelligible to anyone not familiar with 18xx games, and even for an 18xx veteran they are very hard to figure out. 

The early game is somewhat interesting but the last third of the game is just calculating the money you get, without any decisions or moves to make at all. Even though this is a standard 18xx feature, it's does not fit very well in a short card game.

RATING: 6.4
Yes, the rules are written poorly.  I think there was an assumption made that anyone playing this will have played 18XX-series games in the past, and the result is a rulebook with lots of holes.   

That being said, the game is not too bad.  It feels like 18XX games certainly and there are some key decisions to be made.

The game does overstay its welcome however, and if you think you're getting this game done in the 45 minutes the box claims, you've got a surprise headed your way.  My first play clocked in at 2 hours, and we were able to use math to calculate the last 5 operating rounds.  Which is a good segue to...

The game has a lack of decision-making as it approaches the end.  At first, decisions are wide open and each player tries for better position.  However, within 8 Operating rounds of the game end, the game could be finished solitaire.  All moves become obvious and really a matter of using math to determine the best move.  Analysis could potentially drag the game out here.

With the production itself, some baffling shortcuts were taken, including making the tiny stock price board out of super-thin cardboard and including oodles of that really thin paper money from the 1980s.  The cards themselves are of a reasonably good quality, however.  

Overall, the game is worth owning if you like 18xx games and want to play something somewhat quicker (2 hours versus 6 hours for a full 18xx game).  

I am impressed enough that I'll hang onto my copy for a while although I'd really be interested in converting it to playing a 3rd player so that the game becomes a little less about move and counter-move.   Maybe when I get some time I'll post a 3-player variant here on the 'geek.

Based on one play: At two, the 18XX mechanics don't work as well. Since there are only tow players, investing in others becomes less interesting as one player can control and swat trains between their two companies, focusing on the one that they own the most of. Also, with no track laying, it becomes simply a timing of train purchases. A nice idea, but I would suggest something like Poseidon if you want a shorter 18XX game.

A welcome effort of putting 18xx essence into a cardgame format, but why just two players and why so restricted? With more players and bit more options it would actually be a good game. But even then I would still probably prefer to play an actual 18xx game over this at any time.

Pleasently surprised by this games.  There is a bit of tension trying to time the the "train rush" to maximize profits, but one of the investor cards seems broken after one play.  One investor allows a company to buy trian companies at a 20% discount.  That is way too overpowered, especially when buying the 5 and 6 trains.

Overall and ok game that I wouldn't mind playing on occasion.

Very interesting game. Would give it a higher rating if it were more our "style". It's a bit too much math for our taste, and not enough of a feeling of building something up. But that's very subjective, and we would play it again if the occasion arose.

18xx das kartenspiel fur drei spielererer. This is quite a long game for what it is (2 hours at least) -- it's really a travel sized 18xx rather than a short 18xx. If you have the space, you might as well play SoH or 18AL instead.

The rulebook is beyond terrible, even for an experienced 18xx nerd.

I was happy to receive a copy of this as a gift this past Christmas.  As I think others have commented, it does a reasonably good job of simulating the 18xx train rush.  Since a lot of the important issues in the game revolve around this, that is not a bad thing.  I found it to be quite interesting.  Unfortunately, it seems like a game that does not hold promise for those without some pre-existing interest in 18xx.

While we played longer than the stated playing time, we found it to play relatively quickly.  Once we got things straight in our heads, most of the play was very straightforward.  The other big negative is that we had very little to do with about four sets of operating rounds left to go.  While we have played out some 18xx out on paper, it never seems to have been as much as this was.  While it would have been nice to have some decisions to make in the last third of the game, it was still fun and interesting.  Or maybe we're missing something.  [01/08/2011]

Captures the feel of 18xx in a card game.

2-player 18XX without track-building. Works well as a relatively lengthy (90m+) economic 2-player game - for an 18XX newb such as myself, it certainly seemed to encapsulate the flavour of 18XX stock market & train management.

Rules are written quite badly but the game is fun.

I would rate this game higher if it could handle 3 or 4 players. And... the learning curve is very high, and (even with the expanded rules available thru the Geek) much is still left unexplained.

Not a bad attempt at making an 18xx card game, but I don't think it's that great a game. The lack of forced train purchases I think removes a lot of the tension, and the fact that the 8 trains don't have to have routes found for them means the endgame is almost certain to be dull. And I don't see how there's much replayability - there aren't enough different things to do, especially given the fixed operating order and full capitalization.

There are a lot of good ideas here, but with the stock cards being what they are, it's just too fiddly and unfun.

Boring, overstays it's welcome and the gameplay is mainly manipulating the game timing. It doesn't resemble the good bits of 18xx.

Abyss does a better job of replicating the 'benefitting from other people's actions' feel of 1830... And that's a light eurogame about fish people.

I gave it away free...

Great game but the rules are really badly written... a good knowledge of the 18XX is mandatory if you want to understand how to play the game

Terrible rules. Far too long; especially "near" the end when all interesting decisions have already been made.

Nice condensation of the economic part of the 18xx system. Would like to play again.

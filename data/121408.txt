Played 3 games of this last night (rarely play the same game multiple times in an evening).  The strategy used in each game was completely different due to the interactions of the card.  Really enjoy this game.  

Bumped this one to a 10.  This game is what I was seeking in Dominion.  You want to create an efficient engine, but it needs to be tuned to a purpose.  The removal of the action and buy limits makes it a much more interesting experience.

Do you push for train routes early or wait and try to expand near the end.  Game end is controlled by the players and there is a decent amount of interaction.

Dropped rating due to play with experience player.  He was able to easily win the game by doing very little on the map and focusing on the victory point cards.  Hoping that the expansion fixes this.

I still haven't got over the injustice of the constant copying of Dominion's mechanics. This is sooo similar. It has some nice extra touches and it's a good game (almost entirely because of the features ripped from Vaccarino's game). Deck-building is now considered a genre in its own right. I reluctantly accept that this is a quality (if unoriginal) entry into the collection.

I still need to play it more which might change my rating.

It's Dominion with a board... turns out Dominion is better with a board.  The inclusion of the board adds more player interaction and paths to victory than there are in vanilla Dominion.  Given the option, I'd probably choose Trains over Dominion most days.  I'm sure there's some newness factor in Trains' favor, but it really feels like Trains is the deeper game.  Having said that, Thunderstone Advance is still my favorite deckbuilder.

If you like Dominion then you should like this game. It has some very similar game play to Dominion but adds in the idea of building train routes. Seems like it would be Ticket to Ride mixed with Dominion but it is not that similar.  I can't wait for any expansions to add even more flavor to this game. It hasn't replaced Dominion (prob never will) but adds a nice new theme to a great game mechanic that nontradional games may like.

[b]Dominion[/b] with a secondary game going on.  I liked the idea of building two engines between the deck and the board, but it felt a little imbalanced on first play toward the board.  Plus, the more progress you make, the slower your turns get, due to the gunking up of your hand.  Neat idea, if not the most innovative one.  Probably worth another go.

Dominion with a map.  But the map adds a whole new dimension to the game, where you can win by playing cards, as opposed to buying cards being your only source of VP.

Dominion style game gets a major lift in theme by adding railways and a board to build your rails. 

My first two games (played straight after each other) used two of the recommended set ups and they worked really well. With 30 sets of cards to use and only 8 per game, the combinations are wide. 

Great fun, speedy turns and sufficient planning options to make the game have enough meat in to satisfy me.

Deckbuilding+.  The + is in the map elements.  A nice, solid game.  It offers a nice twist on the usual Dominion-esque style of deckbuilding but I don't feel it's a dramatic leap forward nor does it offer anything terribly amazing.  A good game, and better for the brighter colors of the 2nd edition, but not required.  I'll play it occasionally but I'm very unlikely to seek it out.

Yes, it's Dominion with a theme; but it's still a barely present theme!

Mechanically, it's almost superior to Dominion; but at least (expansionless) Dominion doesn't overstay its welcome. Trains is too long for what little it offers, and that is a huge factor in me giving it a rating of 4.

My first game of Trains was with two deck-building fanatics with much skill at what they do. The game ended with me losing; but I was only nine points behind the winner, and two points behind second place....and I didn't have the foggiest idea what I was doing! Yes, luck-of-the-draw plays a huge part in this game.

Not being much of a Dominion fan, I kinda find it to believe I'm saying this, but...give me Dominion over Trains any day!

Absolutely adore this game, favourite deck builder by far.  Excellent choices to be made, good art, and a surprisingly interesting theme.  In addition, someone had the genius idea of putting a BOARD in a BOARD game!  For me, it's light years ahead of dominion and other similar deck builders.  

One knock is that it doesn't truly shine with two players, which is unfortunate for a deck builder.

PROS
- More streamlined and intuitive than Dominion
- Theme works great with deckbuilder, since most deck builders don't usually do
- Board areas of the game works well together 
- Unlimited buys and actions really makes it easy to keep track of what you have
- Not as multiplayer solitaire as there is a board out there
- buying new cards are fun and exciting

CONS
- slight downtime when it's your turn, but as the game goes down the turns go faster and faster 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Feels overcomplicated for such a simple game.  Abilities on the board are kind of wonky, which is fine, but trashing feels pretty inconsistent and I don't really think the board adds enough to differentiate itself strongly.  Thunderstone and Dominion are still my two favorite true deckbuilders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So, trains are money, buildings are estates, duchies and provinces, and waste is a curse, sort of. Yes I found the deckbuilding element of Trains rather too obviously a Dominion knock-off.  Trains does add a board and some decisions about how much to prioritize Dominion-style point generation and how much to structure your deck to build networks and stations.  Building clutters your deck with those waste cards, reducing your ability to put together Dominion-esque big combos.

If viewed as two separate games - a deckbuilder and a network builder - I would declare both duds. Combined, well, they amount to slightly more than the sum of their parts. 

The rules in my AEG edition are clear and readable.  Production is generally good, though I'm not keen on the shiny slippery cards and the box insert is pretty useless.

Rules have a lot of ambiguities (for example, the train track symbol is never defined; does it mean "lay rails right now", or "add a point of rail laying, to use later int the turn"? It makes a difference as to whether a "during this turn" later on the same card has an effect on this rail laying.

Less variety than Dominion, but the cooperative/competitive aspect, where you can make use of opponents' builds, is interesting.

Si te gusta el Dominion, este en mi opinion lo mejora.Se añade un tablero donde iras conectando ciudades y que proporcionaran puntos al final de la partida , ademas de los que obtengas con las cartas en si mismas.Me parece mucho mas variado y ameno que el Dominion original y para que sea redondo del todo solo faltaria quizas un mapa de 2 jugadores y mas cartas direfentes.

Essentially Dominion with a board.  Sure, the board does add some additional ways to score and another dimension away from just shuffling and deck building, but the waste cards are a little too prevalent for my liking and add just a little too much overhead.  Glad I played it, not sure how often it will come out - I think I'd rather play Dominion.

From the deck builders this is not one of my favorites, but I must admit that the game is good and combining deck building with some kind of area control is a nice mix. I don't believe I've seen all the potential of this game, but it still lacks something special to differentiate it from the other deck builders.

Take Dominion, add a board with a route and hub building mechanic.

Subtract an infinite number of unnecessary expansions.

You have just created Trains.

We had never played Dominion before but this one was described as Dominion with trains. And yes, this is another one that Richard Ham talked us into. Curse that man! But it is an awesome deck builder. It's nice to be able to see your work grow on the board as you use cards to build routes and stations. Plus the artwork is so realistic it has us staring at the cards trying to decide whether it is a photograph or not. Maybe there'll be more of these deck builder with a board type games in the future.

Deckbuilder with area control elements. Very cool mechanic with waste, every time you have to do something that can be worth points you get waste, waste does nothing but fills your hand with unuseful cards: basically simlar to dominion's curses but not so negative and you are in control. Speaking about domnion the interactive cards are less an attack to other players, the real interaction happens on the board.

When I first read about this game it sounded a bit too much like a reboot of Dominion to have a place in my game collection, but I was wrong. The deck-building part of the game plays much like Dominion, you draw a hand of five cards and plays them for special effects and money to buy new cards. 

The main difference, and what for me made the big difference between Trains and Dominion, is the game board. Instead of buying victory point cards to score victory points when the game ends (even though you can do that as well) you score by building railroads in the game board and connecting these between cities with train stations. The more stations there are in a city the more victory points is it worth to build there. 

Another thing i really like about this game is that you don't block other players from building rail where you have built like in many other train-themed games, instead making it slightly more expensive for them to build there. So while there most certainly is competition when building you won't see your plans spoiled by someone else building exactly where you need to lay your rails to score.

Got this for a birthday present and I was a little disappointed. I've tried a lot of deck-builders and while this one had some cool new elements (enjoyed the track laying and station building), it didn't feel fresh enough to stand out over the other new deck-builder this month (Star Realms). That being said, it was still a lot of fun and a very streamlined game. I especially liked the thematic use of waste as it accumulates in your hand; but at the same time it might have slowed the game down more as you regularly have to dump waste to be able to do anything. Train themes in general don't get my blood pumping but it fit well and was interesting. I'm just not sure if I'll ever pick up any expansions for this and it would be hard to get this to the table over Legendary, Star Realms, or even Dominion.

Sad, sad game.

Released in 2012, and yet it is pretty much a Dominion Ripoff, so much that it made me wonder how it could even be legal.
The twist, which is supposed to make us think this is better than Dominion, is the map. While I like many winsome games, I felt the tile laying on this one was particularly uninteresting and adds nothing to the game.

So in the end, it's Base Dominion, way too late and without any appealing changes.

Smooth deckbuilder with the added element of a hex board, that lends both a tactile feel to the game and also a little bit of a Martin Wallace 'Steam' influence, though this is far simpler in scope. Randomizer card draw ensures that you will have different supply cards to work with in each game, and you basically cross the map using adjacent spaces based on what cards you play to buy and build. Nice clean design, solid artwork, will be buying the expansions for this, it uses the deckbuilding element to its strengths without aping too many other games, and it's a good 'second' deckbuilder after gateways like Dominion, DC Deckbuilding Game, and Star Realms.

Although this may be considered heresy, I've never played Dominion.  Never wanted to. Eminent Domain was OK.  Trains is very good.  I'm sure most of the aspects here are in the other games too, but the theme here appeals much more me. Every game is different, and there are several viable strategies, although depending on the cards (& other players), some will be much more suitable than others in any individual game.  Only concern so far is that the maps don't really suit 2p games - there is too much space.

Wow!  What can I say?  To start off, I am not a Dominion fan.  It is not my cup of tea.  I just am not excited by deck building games.  But I will not allow that to keep me from trying a game.  Boy, am I glad that I did.  I love this game as I feel that it has removed the essence of the deck building formula that I can not stand and invigorated it with some real strategy in the form of the board and the actions that you take with the cards from you hand.  The game is not solely what you deck consists of, but how you use it each turn in a building, external format.  The deck is not as important as how you use it each turn to carve your way to victory.  A bad deck still gives you plenty of options and strategies that others with finely cultivated decks need to be mindful of.  This makes a bad draw less devastating and more strategic, in my opinion.  This is one that I need to own and look forward to the, hopefully, many expansions to come, ala Dominion.

Played at Isleworth BG - enjoyed it so much immediately played it again - very much like the combination of deck building (and deck clogging) with the use of a board - the fall of the cards wasn't kind to me, and you have to accept that element of luck with each hand, but it is fun and quick. [Edit: last game took around 90 minutes as everyone forgot to deck build and just build on the board leading to large deck clogging....!]
[Edit 2: after a couple of plays where the person who ignored the board and just followed a straight forward deck building strategy wiped the floor with everyone else, it does make me wonder if the board is a bit of a distraction?]

A dominion clone with a map and a train theme. Works well. The innovative elements are the Waste cards you have to take with each action on the map and the fact that the map actions limit your deck building capabilities and offer dual focus strategies. They both work well, but it does not take deck building one step further, like ascension does.

Dominion, with a theme that makes much more sense (and that I enjoy way more!), together with a board and route-building mechanics!

The constant struggle between the need to improve the deck (through acquisition of new cards or waste management) and the need to expand board position fills the game with many meaningful decisions. And the game is fast and fun (not terribly longer than Dominion)!

I'd rate this higher if I'd play it mainly with more players, but with just 2 the board position is a bit less interesting (though it can be played on a half map), because one can nullify the opponent's efforts just building at expense in an already developed (with stations) city.

Anyway, I'd rather play this than any "pure" deck builder (except perhaps for Ascension), and I am looking forward for many more plays, hopefully even with 3+ players!

Ok, so the comparison to Dominion is obvious, but based on it's own merits, Trains is a solid game. Had it been the first deck builder, I'm sure it would have been a classic. But, in the shadow of Dominion, it is derivative. And now, with Dominion's universe of expansions, Trains will surely expand as well and then we'll see how it compares to it's more mature deck-building family. 

Personally, I enjoy the options the board provides. You can focus on a board or card strategy or a combination of both. The productions values are high and they took best practices from others for boxing, card dividers, card quality, etc.

In Trains, you are playing cards to put trains on the board trying to connect cities and to build stations in those cities. The card mix has a lot of similarities to what you would see in Dominion (+ cards, + actions, trashers, etc.). You also have to be careful as Waste cards get added to your deck all of the time. These are just dead weight cards that can only be removed with certain cards or by spending your whole turn to get rid of the Waste in your hand. The spatial element makes this a better game than Dominion for me at least. Another high recommendation from me.

Excellent deck builder.  I have played Dominion a few times but after one play of Trains I knew that this was the game I wanted for my collection.  It does what Dominion does but with more purpose and interaction with players on the board.  You feel like you are building and accomplishing something, a feeling that is lacking in Dominion.

I really enjoyed this game.   What I liked most about this is that the board/trains really intuits a lot of complexity without needing to explain so much.  As a result the cards can make quite a bit of difference without having to have so many rules and rule exceptions.

This really helps, as a beginner, where you can see how things work together, what would be a useful play and what wouldn’t be a useful play without having to have played the game times before.

Initial play:

I suspect that, while this flattens out the jackpot hands causing Dominion's 'advanced slot machines problem,' the balance of the game is to generally ignore the board with some few exceptions until the endgame. Perhaps different card distributions will impact that. It would be interesting if there were cards which gave you income or some other reward for prestige buildings or urban track or rural track or urban track with stations to encourage development in those areas. Perhaps they exist and I just don't know from my 1 play.

I suspect that, if the game doesn't have different incentives for track building from other cards in the mix than what I've seen, this will eventually go to a 2.  If it does but falls flat in other ways, probably a 3.  If it provides interesting choices depending upon the card mix, likely as high as a 7.

Initial rating based on a couple of plays; although the more I've played it, the more I don't know if any of the map strategies can compete with getting the gold cards. Is the map superfluous?

I was hoping for a Dominion-style game with a board that has a theme of interest to my wife and others.  It kind of has that, but I didn't think it was good enough.  The board play was not as interesting as I'd hoped and the waste in the deck really slows down the game (at least it did in my one play).  I'll try it at least once more (with 4 instead of 3 players) to see if my one play was the exception, but I'm not excited about more of this game.

This is a deck builder with an actual board attached. You are trying to make train to city connections on the board, which getting cards that allow you to take other actions in your hand.

Well, I like train games and I like deck builders, so this seems like an obvious choice... except it's not. It feels like two very simple, uncompleted games smashed together. 

The deck building is Dominion style and just seems like some of the cards were tacked on to give them enough cards to randomize the deck building for "replay ability." I've noticed in deck building games that if the cards suck it's not going to get bought. So you end up with stacks of cards that never get bought from... every game, while the 4-5 important stacks just get bought super quick.

The board portion is simple train pushing. Make it to the cities before your opponents to get the points. Yep, that's it. No stocks to play with, no sneaky moves, just lines. I have been looking at buying String Railways where the trains are pieces of sting you lay out, and it appears to be significantly more complicated then this game. String is more complex then this game... string!

I don't flat out turn down games very often, especially if new players are involved or someone is amped about their new game. This game made me look a guy in the eyes and say "Oh man... sorry... I'm sure you'll enjoy the game, I just disliked it so much I'll never play it again."

Interesting use of "Dominion" with a board.  The card combos are not close to as interesting as dominion, but there is a lot to explore here with the various card / board combos.  Can be a little tedious to track "waste", but always have fun playing this one.  Still confused why they made the mountains look like forest?  And why is there no helper player sheet that tells you how expensive it is to lay track on different terrain types?

Rated a 7.  It could go up or down depending on how the next three plays go.  If it catches me, like Dominion did, this will go up. It will go down if the strategy remains the same.  

I do expect varying strategy, especially with the board play, to emerge.  What I see in my head doing is creating random boards as I have a game with hex tiles that I don't play.

This was my second deck building game I played after 100's of games of Dominion, which I love to bits. Only having played the basic set of cards this felt a bit boring. There's the added element by connecting cities with trains which means not only optimizing your deck, but also keeping an eye on what your opponent is building.

There are some nice ideas in the mechanics, but I couldn't shake the feeling of basic Dominion with a map. It looked like they tried to ride on the success of Dominion, without making something that stood out on it's own.

Straightforward deck-building; but the board adds a layer of depth that I was craving and not getting from Star Realms, and a focal point that's missing from Dominion.  Components are nice, though the cubes and rods for track/stations definitely need an upgrade.  Cards are wonderfully slick, making it easier to shuffle, but easy to knock piles around, maybe matte sleeves if I was going to play a lot.

Deckbuilder, combined with a board where players construct track systems. Card play is clearly inspired by Dominion, but there are differences: card draw is much more valuable, for instance, and many action cards also give purchasing power. The board is well-integrated into the game, rather than a gimmick. The waste mechanic (and ability to skip a turn to clear out waste) is also interesting.

Tentative rating, might go up with more plays. 

My friends like to make fun of my love for trains and my suspect taste, so they knew Trains was a must-have for me the moment they saw it, hehe.

Trains is basically Dominion (some cards are identical) BUT your actions are reflected on the map(s), and that simple change makes for a very different gaming experience. My two plays were really enjoyable, although I suspect it will improve once all players are proficient and cards are selected randomly at the start of the game.

The biggest drawback, however, is the lack of an insert to organize the cards. I need to get one of those long boxes to store them all (over 500!) and reduce the setup time.

RATING: 7
This has some of the same positive features and flaws as Dominion. I enjoyed my 1 play so far (2-player) though I think the board play would be a lot more interesting with more players, or a smaller 2-player board. In that sense, I don’t think it scales as well as Dominion. However, certain aspects are better: the unlimited buys/actions make some of the more annoying chaining features of Dominion obsolete, which is good. In their place, you get the play on the board which has the opportunity to be interesting, if the board is more congested. My one play so far used the Landfill (as recommended for your first game in the rules) so we were able to freely take waste with the knowledge that we’d be jettisoning it regularly. This would also be harder in 3+ player because we wouldn’t end up with 5 Landfills each!

Overall a qualified 7 that I think probably will eclipse Dominion (which I don’t play much anymore). Having 2 different boards is kind of neat, but they don’t seem THAT much different so I’ll have to see. Definitely would like to play with 4 because I think the board play will be MUCH tighter and more interesting.

- Trains: Gencon 2013 Board

I first played this game at Gencon 2013 during the AEG Friday Game Night. I enjoyed it alot but it was far too big to be brought home in my bag. I was estatic when I found several copies in my FLGS recently and immediatly bought a copy.

On Tuesday night I was able to play it with one of my game groups. It was as well received by them as it was with me. The game plays alot like dominion and steam which is a good thing. Dominion was my first deck builder so I'll always think of it fondly, although I haven't played it much of late. Steam was my first post Ticket to Ride train game push and I now prefer Steam over Ticket to Ride. I had thought deck builders were getting stale but Trains definatly reignited my interest in them.

Wow, someone took Dominion and turned it into a game! Competing for places on a map makes the soulless mechanic of deckbuilding-for-deckbuilding's-sake much more interesting and strategic. The added element of waste is a brilliant touch, and makes the game really challenging and fun.

Now if I could only convince someone to take our ridiculously large Dominion Big Box off our hands...

RATING: 7
The board play is a nice addition but the deck building is very close to Dominion.  The decks being cut a slightly different size really pisses me off.  Why on earth AEG doesn't use a quality card manufacturer for a CARD GAME is beyond me.  You have to shuffle your deck a lot of times in this game and right from the start riffle shuffling doesn't work well because one of the starting cards (Station Expansion) is 0.5mm longer than the others.  It only gets worse as the game goes on because you add in more cards that are different lengths.  Inexcusable. 

It's OK for something different, but it won't replace my deck building favorites (Thunderstone, Dominion) and because of the crappy card quality I see no reason to keep it in my collection.

A decent dominion clone. The board doesn't add a lot of extra depth or strategy--at least not in 2-player games.

I enjoy this game quite a bit - I have a review on my site - but it does need a house rule. Here is the one we use: Apartments come with 1 Waste, Towers 2, and Skyscrapers 3. Otherwise, it's too easy in many configurations to rack up cash and VP cards and just run the board late. It's close, but adding additional Waste seems like it makes these degenerate strategies fairly hard to play.

Alternately, just use the yellow cards in Trains: Rising Sun, which seem much better balanced.

RATING: 5
As a deck-building game, Trains will receive the inevitable comparison to the grand-daddy of them all, Dominion.  Now, if Trains had come out before Dominion, I might rate it a solid 8 or 9.  However, half of Trains is a direct port of Dominion, with some of the cards even functioning exactly the same.

Really, the entire game offers nothing really different from Dominion, other than some cards allow you to place cubes on a board to score points.  But this part of the game is so simplistic, that they could really just release a train expansion for Dominion and do the exact same thing. The board really felt superfluous, rather than something that was interesting.

The only part of Trains I maybe enjoyed a little more is that there's no limit on actions, so you can always play anything from your hand.

Otherwise, given the choice between Trains and Dominion, I would play Dominion every time.  Trains is an OK game, but unfortunately it's just way too close to Dominion and without any interesting bells or whistles to make it a superior choice.

This is a solid game. I enjoy it, but I wouldn't choose it over many of my other games. Maybe I've just played too much Dominion (the perfect and original deck building game), but this game seems to be lacking something.  What happens on the board seems uninteresting.  There aren't quite enough ways to control your deck, which is bad because so many things give you waste.

That being said, if you aren't as snobby about your deck building games as I am, this one is definitely more thematic and "fun" than dominion.  I just don't play it much because I am so into dominion.

Something about the balance isn't quite right. I don't think the board allows players to protect their points well enough. It's ALWAYS worth it to expand onto spaces with other people's train stations. Perhaps if the penalties were harsher, it'd be more worthwhile to block other players on the board.

RATING: 7
This is some really good stuff. I cannot stress enough how much the board play adds a new dimension to the deck building formula.

At first glance, this pulls a LOT from Dominion specifically. Looking over the rules and reading the cards, I was worried this would feel too much like Dominion and the board would simply be a gimmick - it has the same currency cards (in terms of cost to output), some straight up card clones, same verbage ("trashing"), same hand size... but within a couple turns it was apparent just how different Trains feels.

It really is a board game first - the deckbuilder portion is comparatively simplistic as it's just a vehicle (hah!) for the board play. It works incredibly well and results in some exciting new dilemmas, particularly by giving a new use for currency. You don't have enough money this turn to expand your rails AND buy a new card. Which do you do?!

The waste cards are also an effective new system, giving you some tough choices.

Everything about the game just feels expertly balanced. The board is much larger than your cube supply; you will NOT be able to explore the whole thing, so choose your path wisely! Getting to choose your start position really adds to this.

Coming from Dominion and all its expansions, though, the number of cards in the box might feel a little disappointing. It's sort of like going into just base game Dominion. Maybe even with less cards than that.

The only negative things I have to say are to do with the components. They're not of poor quality, per se, but I would MUCH prefer matte cards to the game's glossy cardboard. These are more of a pain to shuffle.

As for the board, the VP track feels like a waste of space as most of your points are scored during the endgame. I would prefer the VP track replaced by a reminder of the cost for laying a rail on each tile, and some chips be included for extra VPs gained through card play.

I'd also have been happier if they'd just cloned the Dominion box. I appreciate that they're trying to give you plenty of space for expansions but not having real slots for my cards is kind of driving me insane. Yeah they give you some foam to keep them in place but it's more of a hassle to pull out cards and put them back in.

Lastly, the name! "Trains"? How am I going to get people to play this with such a boring name??? The art doesn't help either. When I showed my boyfriend the game excitedly HE LITERALLY LAUGHED. Then he played it. Now, at least, there's two of us to convince everyone else to play!

Update: As much as I enjoy this game when I play it, it really does lose something by not having the sheer variety of Dominion's many expansions. Between Dominion as a whole system and Automobiles (which is feels more different from Dominion than this does, and retains that key interactivity I really dug in Trains in the first place, only even more) I don't feel the need to keep this in the collection anymore. Going up for trade.

It's boring.  Very dry.  Doesn't work at all with 2 players.  Very repetitive in a bad way.  There doesn't seem to be a reason to build out your rail network.  Why not just buy VictoryPoint cards?  Why have the map at all?

Combines deck builder with a game board. But I think Clank does it better, and in a more fun way.

RATING: 7
It’s not exactly Dominion on/with a board, but it’s pretty close… However, there are some significant differences. First of all, despite the fact that there are no limits on the number of actions and buys on your turn, Trains didn’t strike me as having the same possibilities of crazy chains and combos. Maybe the cards that are included in Trains are just too basic or don’t have enough +draws or something like that, but it just felt less elegant than Dominion as you can always play all of the cards you want, so a skilled player cannot really get a comparatively large advantage. I think that it’s harder to make your deck much better than the other players’ when you’re able to play every card anyway (though of course you can still make your deck more effective, and it’s obviously still extremely important which cards you decide to buy for your deck).

I like the fact that the cards provide money themselves so you can buy new cards even with the so-called ”action cards” as those also have a monetary value. Sure, you might still want a limited express train or something like that, but it’s perfectly possible to win without focusing too much on money. This is directly caused by the fact that you don’t need to buy your VP in Trains, unlike Dominion. In Trains you can get points during the game, but a huge chunk of your total victory points will come from the board; you need to lay a lot of rails in order to extend your rail network to city spaces and build station for lots of points! I’ve tried various strategies and none seem to be better than others. I have won with minimal focus on the board (less than 20 points) and buying VP cards, and I’ve won without buying a single VP card. In either case, you will get waste cards throughout the game. These act like curses in Dominion, though they are not so bad as they don’t give negative points and you can get rid of them through various cards – or by the great mechanic that you skip your entire turn in order to return the waste cards on your hand to the original waste pile! This is truly a clever way of trashing and getting rid of those awful cards. 
Trains has far less direct attacking; you cannot even block people from building on spots, but only make it more expensive for them. I did kind of miss an attack card which could remove rails certain rails from the board (at a cost, obviously) or “close” a city so nobody else can build there etc. If you don’t like in-your-face-competition, I think Trains is a better suit for you than Dominion with attack cards (but if you don’t use attack cards, Dominion is of course a much more solitare and boring game in my opinion).

Finally I have to mention that I don’t think the basic game provides the greatest replayability in itself; I really want expansions that add new cards, because those in the basic game are very, well, basic! It’s the same deal with Dominion, though I still find basic Dominion slightly better than basic Trains. I’m sure there will be many expansions, it’s just a matter of time. Oh, one minor thing I want to mention when comparing Dominion and Trains is that Trains doesn’t use the tie-breaker rule of Dominion, though it seems even more important in this game… Actually I lost a game because the player right ahead of me put down his last cube which got him 8 points – he won on the tie-breaker that you have more cubes on the board. He got one more turn than me… Now that was lame! Anyway, that’s a minor niggle. All in all Trains is a different game than Dominion because it emphasizes play on the board, and this is a great thing. But in order to love Trains I need more interesting cards…

Deck building game that is very similar to Dominion. Differences being the game board and the train theme. The card combos are not nearly as impressive as Dominion, but the game play is welcomed because it does play different enough by having cards to use towards the board. Also, the theme of trains is less geeky to the family. I would prefer Dominion over Trains because it focuses more on the deck building aspect but this game plays well, too.

A decent deck builder that I liked although it did feel like Ticket to Ride as really you are simply drawing cards to lay rails or build stations in both games. The only difference is there are many more cards in Trains that add some variety to how you go about doing this as you need to do it as efficiently as possible. 

I will say it was great that the big money strategy that usually works really well in basic Dominion, did not work well at all here as that player finished last and the person who focused mostly on rails and stations won. I'd be up for playing again to see what other cards there are although the game felt longer than what it should have been during our first play.

Accurately described as Dominion meets your basic route building game of choice. Trains is a very solid effort, though I think it would ultimately benefit from professional development.

The crux of the game is Dominion style deck building. The basic concept of money cards, victory cards, and rule breaking cards (draw more cards, sculpt deck, &c.) is the same, but additional cards are in the mix that allow you to play track and stations onto the board, with said board play providing a majority of the points.

Additionally, a neat twist is that placing wood onto the board creates waste which are like Curse cards in Dominion, cruft which clogs your deck that you need to keep under control to actually be able to effectively do anything.

My main point of concern with this is that the nature of the track building can make the game a bit swingier than Dominion as players need to draw both a track building card and the resources necessary to place said track. Making sure that the players have some ability to sculpt their deck in the card mix would help in this regard (aside from the always present option of dumping drawn waste in exchange for your turn), and there might be a clean implementation that development could find as well. That said, I tend to love the original ideas that the Japanese come up with, and this is a very solid effort that I expect will get picked up as it is uber expandable as both the board itself and the cards are potential sources of interest. Those who dislike Dominion will be extremely unlikely to find enough added by the board to give this a go, but those who like Dominion and like the idea of having some additional things to think about should definitely seek it out.

A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back. The frog asks, "How do I know you won't sting me?" The scorpion says, "Because if I do, I will die too."  The frog is satisfied, and they set out, but in midstream, the scorpion stings the frog. The frog feels the onset of paralysis and starts to sink, knowing they both will drown, but has just enough time to gasp "Why?" Replies the scorpion: "Its my nature..."

That's the way I felt with Trains. I've tried deckbuilders like Dominion and Thunderstone. They just don't do much for me. But Trains, I heard, was super fantastic! And it has a board--I like boards! Turns out, it's still a deckbuilder.

Superior to Dominion in every way. The map provides a means for player interaction and some incentive to derive from the one "optimal" build in accordance to your starting position, the waste mechanic adds one more resource to manage and the fact that it's possible to score on the board and with your deck enables more diverse and opportunistic strategies.

This is very much like Dominion... except for a few things.  It has more theme.  You can buy until your money runs out.  You can use all of the actions you are able to.  This is FUN.  It could have benefited from train meeples rather than cubes.  I think the board adds more strategy.  You can't really ignore the board if you want to win.  This is a great game.

Clever - at least, the board-driven play is, providing a lovely reason why tempo matters. Play the pure money game and you fall behind on board position; being behind on board position costs more to catch up from. Nice. 

Some of the deckbuilding aspects feel a little more Dominion-derivative than I'd prefer, though.

I've heard rumor that you can/should ignore the board entirely, but I've also heard rumor the opposite way. I'd really hope that they playtested vs. Big Money; it seems an obvious and easy thing to have checked.

A double sided board for literally about the same number of players. Brilliant. I guess we will try to mess around with what you gave us and try to make a game that works with it. Block off stuff? Oh who knows.

This game solves two main issues I have with Dominion - lack of interaction (the board is great addition for the gameplay as well as for the theme) and unlimited combos when one player plays out his whole deck in one round (yes, there can be certain setups when this can partially occur, but I think the main focus of the game is elsewhere). Although Trains looks as a copy of Dominion (yes, many cards are nearly the same), the difference represented mainly by a board makes it a completely different (and for me much more enjoyable) experience. I really love the game so far.

Preliminary rating after a single play. The combination of deck building and the board is sound but I highly dislike the idea that all cards are basically copied from Dominion and the fact that the board doesn't seem that important since you can still buy victory point cards.

A deckbuilder lodged in a cardgame.
Each round, a player drafts some cards from his small deck trying to establish a valuable hand that allows him to buy more powerful cards from the ones available on the table, adding them to his deck. 
However, increasing the size of the deck also means increasing the number of "trash" cards in the deck, so the player must "run" through the deck more fast trying to find the cards he wants or needs. There is also a small board where some strategical decisions must be made.
The only drawbacks of the game are the enormous amount of cards involved and well...it remains just a cardgame (but a damn good one, i must admit).

More fun that a pure deck builder but not as much fun as 18xx, AoS, Steam. With a large number of cards in the box, there is a lot of different types of games that happen. Sometimes recycling waste will be easy and other times it's going to slow down the game - it just depends on the cards available. Once the players understand the cards, play moves fairly quickly between players.

The route building and map maneuvering really make this game more enjoyable than deck building. There is a little bit of planning and moving advantage on the board in order to get to the high point cities while it's still cheap. The two player maps really make the game tight in terms of conflict. You need to limit the station markers to the number on the board since the box comes with enough for the 4 player maps.

For now it's found a place in the school night rotation as being somewhat interesting, can tolerate some interruptions and finishes in about an hour.

[14 Jul 2017] - 6.75 (10 plays)
Finished up with this for the 2017 10x10 challenge and had to drop the rating a bit. First, it's a quick game to get through if the players are familiar with the concept of deck building and are looking at the cards prior to their turn. The 2 player maps reduce the station markers and route cube supplies so things go even faster. Second, I find it more interesting than a pure deck builder. The deck building is a tool to build routes but really it's a route building game. It is very solitaire and why the rating was dropped a bit. About the only interaction is through routes taken and the card supply. Even then, it's light interaction. It's not a game that I'm looking to pull out right away but I'll keep it and see if it ages any better.

An interesting combination of deck building and empire building game. As you race to build a train network waste from construction fills your hand preventing you from building.

The point-producing cards have been devalued relative to their counterparts in Dominion, so you'll be devoting quite a bit of attention to laying track and building stations. In fact, in our games, we've had trouble accumulating the eight "dollars" needed to acquire the equivalent to the Province card; consequently, the board has generated far more points than the cards have. The minimal interplay on the Trains board with two players does not offset the loss of dynamism in the cards. Thus, Dominion is the better game for two, but Trains rivals it with more players. And, when the expansions appear, who knows?

Very fun and variable, with different boards (expansions) and stacks of cards.  A slick deckbuilder.  Similar to Dominion in mechanics but doesn't feel like Dominion because of the strong train theme and board.  The one similarity though is that, like Dominion, certain stacks might not be touched, while there will be a mad rush for cards in other stacks.

The quality and feel of the cards are superb - just adds to the cool, modern look of the art on the cards.  

This has become one of my favorite games.  Smooth, slick game play.  the "waste" cards add an interesting element. 

Lots of expansion boards.   Great game.

It's Dominion with a map but it still manages to feel fresh despite this. Some nice tweaks such as being able to skip a turn and discard all waste (which is the curses of Trains). You produce a lot of waste as you expand on the map, so this rule is great.

The maps also adds much needed interaction between players. Not much rules overhead and adds plenty to the game.

All in all a game that I'll gladly play instead of or in addition to Dominion.

Major problem apart from the cards being quite ugly imho are the weird design choices such as super small grey font on dark background making it more or less impossible to read the cards in less than stellar light.

Players are developing railways and infrastructure, around the regions of Tokyo and Osaka.  This is a deck building game, with a map.  Players use the now familiar draw cards, play cards, discard your hand mechanics to generate income and invest that income into more cards, or track on the game board.  The game board is a hex map, onto which players deploy cubes (tracks, which cost money from cards played), or stations (which make track connections worth more victory points).  The more congested the board gets, the more expensive it becomes to expand through the congestion.  Player decks quickly become stressed with useless Waste cards - gained whenever players build something.  The game ends when four decks are empty; when players have run out of track; or when all the stations have been constructed.  Victory points in deck and on board are tallied for the win.  Fantastic melding of two distinct genres - deck building, and Winsome-esque route building.  The game delightfully wedges the player into decision paralysis ... what do you do with the money?  Get better cards, or get board position now?  This played quickly, and worked very well.  Three games in, can't fault it.  Perfect.

I do appreciate why this game is popular, but from my personal viewpoint, this is in no way a replacement for Dominion.  Trains copies only the most boring Dominion cards, and lacks the interesting card mechanisms that the earlier game brings.  I find the board element somewhat distracting, and the waste mechanism downright annoying.  I once read something from a prominent game designer who said that he tried to avoid rules where players had to remember to do something detrimental to themselves.  Here, you always have to remember to take that waste.

Half Dominion, and half Winsome cube rails.   Almost literally.  (And what took so long?)  I like that you get all your actions and coins, and you can buy as many things as you can afford, or use your money to develop your rail lines and stations (if you have the right cards).   There seems to be a good spread of ways to get points.   Typical rail-building incentivization and back-scratching is present, and that's sometimes a turn-off for me, but I enjoyed the way it works in this game, probably because it's fairly light overall.   The game also greatly benefits from good use of photographs for art, and an overall grungy industrial look (Japanese version only).  Proof that train themes don't have to be dull and boring. Sorry to see AEG isn't sticking with that.   I'm sure their sleek, shiny, futuristic trains will sell better, so it makes sense, and it looks good in its own way.

Interaction minimal; doesn't start until rails meet and even then... I dunno. I've only played with 2p, will give final verdict with at least 3 players. Feels like Dominion with a board at this point. Will give this another shot, but only with 3p+.

deck builder with a board. depending on the card set up, there maybe or may not be variety in strategy. Ala most deck builders there are 2 or 3 cards that are clearly better then the others in play and the play who most efficiently uses those cards will win. if this is your 
idea of fun, this is a pretty good option. if it isn't avoid at all cost.

Value vs play... there isn't great play variety in the box. most of the cards are derivations of each other with a different cost. for example the card "draw 1 card" costs 3,  draw 2 cards costs 5, & draw 3 cost 7 coins... so there is a strong 'sameness' from game to game.

I've played Trains twice now, with just 2 players each time, and I have to say I already like it a bit better than Dominion. The spatial element of the board as opposed to cards only, the railway theme as opposed to zero theme, and the shorter turns as opposed to long chains all give it a tick over the big D. I can tell it will be better with more players given there will be more competition for space on the board, but already I'm glad I picked this up and am looking forward to playing it again.

Best with 3.

It has all the worst parts of a deck building game. It further adds the insult that your deck continues to get worse, rather then better. I do like the use of a board for area control, but it doesn't excuse the crappy feel and utter luck based nature of the deck building aspect. Easily one of the worst deck builder available.

RATING: 7
Played once.  A good Dominion clone that adds a bit with regards to the board.  This won't replace Dominion for me, only because of the sheer variety of Dominion cards that are available.

Dominion style deck-builder but adds an interesting train theme, plus a board for increased challenge.  Best with 3-4, with 2 players use the 2 player boards from the stand-alone sequel/expansion Trains: Rising Sun.

See my review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1347360

The bottom line: If you enjoy deck-building games like Dominion and are looking for some variety in the genre, you will love Trains. With a familiar deck-building core that is solidly indebted to Dominion, it provides a fresh feel, increased interaction, and new tactical and strategic challenges as a result of the addition of a board, along with new options for point-scoring, and new twists like the waste mechanic. It makes a welcome contribution to the deck-building genre, and shines in ways where much of the competition falters. Fans of deck-building games who appreciate what Dominion brings to the table and are looking for something that builds on its tried-and-true formula without departing too much from it, will find much that delights them on the rails of Trains.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the game Dominion should have been.

Route. Building, pick up and deliver, deck building...who wouldn't be curious?

Having played it, I like it well enough to play it if someone has a burning desire, but I'm not seeking it out.

The waste mechanism is the most clever part of the game, other than that it's board element is dull. As a deck builder it's fine, but it pales against Few Acres of Snow and Concordia as wall a Study in Emerald.

RATING: 5
For me, when I compare this game with Dominion, it has the advantage that it is about something going on on the map, rather than being totally inwardly focused.  On the other hand, the cards aren't as interesting as those for Dominion (perhaps not a fair comment given that Dominion has had many expansions.)  In fact, it's easy to get a game where nothing interesting is going on, something that rarely happens in Dominion.

This game is not designed for two-players. Unless both players choose to start close to each other, you are pretty much free to build out in your half of the map however you please. So, not very interesting for two.

But I like the slight twist on deckbuilding. The extra network-building element seems extremely light and rather tacked-on, yet it's just compelling enough for me to enjoy as lighter fare.

Played 1 time with 4 players.

Being a big Dominion fan, I was curious to play this. I'd read some reviews that said Trains made Dominion superfluous! 

Having now played it - meh. It's good. It's like Dominion, but with a board that turns the game into more of a Euro. But I'm not a huge Euro game fan anymore, and feel like Dominion is both more (enjoyably) complex, and has (even in just the base game), more fun combos to explore.

Still, Trains would be a great game for light gamers who wouldn't enjoy the complex combos and action chains etc.

Basically, offbrand Dominion. A deck building game that they tried to throw a board into.  Also, you know those "curse" cards you hate from Dominion so you change the random card selection to keep them out of your game?  They're called "trash" in Trains, and they're in every game.  A lot.  No matter what.

Still, Dominion is amazing, so a step down from Dominion is still pretty good.  Given the choice, though, I'd play Dominion every time.

I'm not sure why, but even though I disliked (and sold my copy of) Dominion, I really love this game.  It has become a big hit with my family, and even my 4 year old son enjoys playing it.  

Unlike most deckbuilders, this one has multiple paths to victory, you really have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing, and you have the spacial dimension that comes from using a board.

I have the base set plus the first 2 map packs, and am eagerly looking forward to getting my hands on Rising Sun and any other expansions that come out in the future.

Jópofa, vonatos témájú deckbuilding. Elég sok lapot pofátlanul nyúltak a dominionból, és itt most nem az egyszerűbbekre gondolok, hanem akár a masquerade-re. Persze itt mindnek valami vonatos neve van, amibe azért tematikát nem igazán sikerült vinni.
Ami viszont nagyon jó, hogy a térképen történő közös építkezéssel megtörik az amúgy deckbuilderekre jellemző szoliter jelleget. Van miért harcolni, figyelni a másikat, szóval lényegesen több az interakció, mint a hasonló játékokban általában. Egy játék után viszont úgy éreztem, hogy lényegesen nagyobb a szerencse szerepe, mint a megszokott. Ez két dolog miatt van így:

1. rengeteg waste-et kapunk az építkezések során, és még ha van is kidobáló lapounk, akkor is hatalmas paklink lesz a játék közepére. Logikus, hogy egy nagyobb pakliból kevésbé lehet tervezni, hogy várhatóan mit mivel fogunk előbb-utóbb felhúzni.
2. kulcsfontosságú a sínépítés. Ha úgy húzod be a sínépítő kártyáidat, hogy nincs mellettünk elég pénz az akcióra, akkor az igen fájdalmas. Itt megintcsak súlyosbít a hatalmas pakli, mivel az eltékozolt építés nagyon sokára fog újra feljönni.

Szívesen kipróbálom majd még másik szett akciókártyával, mert így elsőre ambivalensek az érzéseim. 

6.8
----
A második játék se győzött meg. Egyszerűen túl nagy mák kell a megfelelő kombók behúzásához és ennyi játék idő alatt ez nem egyenlítődik ki. Ezen felül értelmezhetetlen előnye van a kezdőjátékosnak minden fronton, azért ilyesmire illik figyelni a tervezésnél.

RATING: 6
At first glance Trains is a Dominion clone with a board. After the second look this is still mostly true but the few differences still add up to a very different game overall.

The most obvious change also has the largest impact on the game: The board not only provides an alternative (actually, the primary) way  to score, it also provides another dimension to the deckbuilding aspect. Most actions on the board actually water down your deck by adding waste cards so you are often sacrificing raw card power for advancing your board position or vice versa.

Trains also meddles with the deck-building part, however. Unlimited actions and buys nicely get rid of one of the more aggravating Dominion traits, near-endless card combos. On the other hand, the card functions are clearly on the simple and not so very interesting end of the spectrum, shifting the focus away from building and awesome deck and fearsome combos and towards building a lucrative rail network on the boards. This is a deck-building game that is not really interested in deck-building, but concerns itself with questions of timing and collusion instead.

While I applaud the ideas behind it it remains to be seen whether the game has staying power.

It's Dominion with a board for placing trains. What it does well is that it prevents massive chains of cards and it kills the dominance of the big money strategy, but then again, I like both of those things about Dominion. it is probably the best I have seen for a straightforward deck building game in the post dominion world, but after my initial play, I'd still rather play Dominion. or thunderstone for all its clunky insanity.

I'm a big Dominion fan, and the board and little extras makes Trains different enough to be its own fun category of Deck Builder.

Also, I would buy this game if they update the board graphics and components.

Merger between deck building and area control. There is nothing bad about the game but it just doesn't draw me in

The deck building part doesn't stand out because it's harder to trash and you get more waste so your deck naturally becomes bigger than standard deck building games. That was a detraction for me since it made that part seem more random

The area control part of this game was good and added more decisions. Overall deck builders have to be really good to grab me these days and be worth the investment to learn the cards. This game doesn't do it for me and the trains theme isn't a draw either (for me personally)

I can't deny it any more: Trains is outstanding.

Deckbuilding powers the engine to race for points on the board, with a little riding on coattails in the sharing of developed locations. And with no limits on how many actions nor how many purchases, Trains avoids the curse of feeling like just a Dominion clone. Shockingly good. I'm betting this will be a big hit.

Thanks, Lorna!

Yes its Dominion with trains and a board.  I liked it, but don't see the deck-building having the same depth possible in Dominion, so the main tension seems to be the timing in getting onto the map, and the proportions to spend on getting more track-laying or VP-generating income.  Happy to explore further.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good Dominion variant - basically add a board and use your actions to lay track and build on the board to secure VP. Actions/Buys are limited only by how much "money" (train points) you have in your hand. And finally add "Waste" (Curses in Dominion) which is generated by many of your actions and needs to be cleared out.

The rules are very clear, play is easy and fun, all the bits and art are very good.

Looking forward to the expansions.

Even in a two player game, the base game maps are fine and can offer competition if you decide to build near each other. Can't wait to get the smaller US/Germany maps. A step above Tunderstone Advance for speed and variety.

Preliminary rating after one play. Didn't like it very much. As far as I can tell it is not different enough from Dominion to justify a purchase.
I find myself still thinking about the game and what I may have missed. Maybe I need a few more plays to get it. I had a similar reaction to Dominion the first time I played it.

RATING: 7.5
It's a nice new spin on deckbuilding, and I'll probably get the expansion because another 25 cards would really open it up.

Most of my plays have been 2p with my wife, and they have been good.  It's a better game with more people though for sure.

Adding the board is cool, but the deckbuilding is just not at the level of Dominion, or some of the Dominion clones.

Trains takes a very recognizable Dominion engine and uses it to power a positional track-building board game. Sound awkward? The surprise is that these two half-games form a beautiful and quite natural-feeling marriage.

The deck-building engine is wisely kept simple, since your attention will be divided between the card half-game and the board half-game. Victory point cards are made more painful and less profitable than in Dominion, in order to encourage board play as your primary source of victory point scoring. Board play also inflicts pain in the form of Waste cards that are added to your deck as you build track and stations. Waste cards are do-nothing deck cloggers, although you can skip your turn to trash any and all waste cards in your hand.

Trains is a really slick game, and the play flows effortlessly for anyone familiar with Dominion or its close relatives. My imaginary U.S. publishing firm would sign a deal for this game in the blink of an eye, if not for the fact that we don't exist. The game is simply to good not to find a U.S. publisher.

My only complaint so far is that the Waste cards should be colored slightly differently so that they immediately can be identified as "the part of my hand that I ignore" without having the read the title or look for the picture.

Excellent deckbuilding game where you improve your deck as well as make actions on a board. It flows very well and gives your actions more of a purpose. The player interaction avoids monotony and adds replayability.

This game is practically a reimplementation of Dominion, right down to specific cards that serve the same exact function. It adds in a board with route-building as the primary method of point-scoring, instead of just VP cards. 

While the lack of creativity displayed here is disappointing, it actually works pretty well. And though I'd certainly never choose to play this over Dominion (adding a board does nothing to improve the game), I'd generally be happy to play this game.

Our play had no waste management cards and the subway expansion which felt really broken. So, two people are in a city with 3 stations they took time/waste to build, and all it takes for another player to claim those 8 points is a subway expansion and 2 waste?! It's the last run through the deck, that's basically a non-cost by that point... The board idea is interesting, but it seemed impossible to protect points.

RATING: 7.25
Based on first play of a friend's set...

Trains is a Dominion clone with a difference, that being the board and claiming points via geography as well as via cards.

The cards were quite slick, but otherwise seemed durable enough.  Colors are very bright in the AEG version, and it took me a little while to sort out how the cost vs. dollar value was indicated on the cards- but really the artwork is clear enough once one gets their head around it.

Points are claimed far more on the board than in the deck: players get points for connecting in cities with stations, fixed points are also gained for endpoint cities, for VP cards (Skyscrapers, Tower, and Apartments), and for playing Tourist Trains.

I got myself schooled, but certainly see a few places where I didn't play optimally. First off, I spent a lot of capital on VP Cards, letting my building on the board fall behind.  Second, where I chose to start was not terrific in hindsight.  Third, I didn't use Tourist Trains, which if purchased early become a nice added VP source.

I think this is a terrific adder to Dominion, and if someone was familiar with Dominion but didn't own it yet I might certainly point them in this direction.

Yes, this game is very similar to Dominion, but there are two important differences that made it feel very different to me: the board, which provides an alternate way to get points and a more direct way of wrangling with one's opponents, and the waste cards, which are deck-cloggers and should therefore be very familiar, but they're different because gaining them is not so much an attack as an inevitable result of playing cards.  I really enjoy both those ideas, and the feeling that you are constantly struggling to turn your deck into something workable appeals to me as well.  I quite liked it, even if other people think it is too close to Dominion. (1 play)

Dominion on rails, and that's very good! Very fun and easy to pick up. Solid DBG. Siguiendo el mismo formato de Dominion, en Trains el jugador debe construir un buen mazo de cartas que le permita adquirir puntos de victoria. Lo diferente es que el juego tiene un tablero que representa el mapa de una ciudad y se incorpora así un elemento de control de territorio en el juego. Durante cada turno los jugadores deben adquirir cartas y reclamar posiciones en el tablero para maximizar sus posibilidades de puntos al final del juego.

Positives:
1) The board gives you a visual representation of how everyone is doing points wise, as well as a different path to victory other than buying points cards.
2) The 'card draw' cards are much more expensive than in dominion, that as well as the waste cards means that cycling through your whole deck every turn is no longer viable.
3) There are no +buy or +actions (they are unlimited), so keeping track of how many actions you have left is no longer a problem.

Negatives:
1) A lot of the decks seem a bit rubbish or just underwhelming.
2) The theme and art of the cards is inredibly dull, I much prefer the art on dominion cards.
3) One of my favourite things about dominion is being able to refine your deck by trashing cards.

It doesn't replace dominion for me, maybe it will with expansions?

Edit: the rising sun expansion card decks seem to be just as underwhelming as the base game, not a good start.

Trains is yet another entry in the contest to make a game that tops Dominion by grafting mechanics on to it. This time, it's area control - and sadly, that portion of the game falls flat as it never really feels tight. That leaves the deckbuilding part of the game. By itself, that feels like a broken Dominion clone.

Really, really good deckbuilder combined with area control and route building. You build your deck to help you create routes and control certain areas to earn points.

The pollution mechanic in the game is quite interesting, as you build your railways and do certain actions you start gaining trash to your deck which are essentially dead cards when you draw them. The mechanic is quite thematic as well since you can't just build stuff wherever you want and leave the debris sitting around for others to pick up.

While I do really like the game the theme is a bit hard to swallow for some. The art on the cards is great but the board is a bit bland. The only thing keeping it lower for me is the theme as it doesn't really grab me as much and it's sometimes hard to convince people to play a game about trains with you that isn't ticket to ride.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2013)

Trains is a good game, the innovation is that it comes with a game board in which you need to build railroads and trains stations to win VPs. I´m indifferent (leaning towards “I don’t like it”) to the trains theme, still it is very thin as the game really don’t convey it. It is very Dominion derivative, many of the cards have the same cost and do the same things, you also play with a 5 card hand. For me both games are VERY similar, so I felt that I was playing Dominion, perhaps this the deckbuilding game that most resembles Dominion despite the board. The board DO add new things to consider when you play, but it still feels the same thing to me. When I compare it to Dominion, I vastly prefer to play Dominion. 

With 4 players the game can take a long time, I think it is best played with 2. I also like that it has an static market offering (unlike Ascension) assuring a fairness that I value in deckbuilding games. 

I´m also indifferent to the art, it is merely ok and it serves its purpose.

I had this on my wish list, I´m glad I played it before I bought it, because now I won’t get it at all. It is an ok game but I already have Dominion to fill that niche in my collection. I will play again if requested.

The parallels to Dominion are as obvious as you can get, but the train building mechanic on a map add a whole new level of strategy and uniqueness. Lots of card combinations promise for good replayability, and simple rules, short playing time, and fun, quick turns make this a must-have!

RATING: 8.8
A Dominion beater, the board makes all the difference and adds another dimension to what you are playing from your hand as well as varying the scoring options.  The only negative after playing more 4 player games is the feeling that everyone is scoring the same due to occupying the same board space which losses some of the more personal aspects in the way you have built up your score.  This can lead to very close scoring games.

missing a train station marker :(

Nice variant on Dominion that grafts a train-connection element onto a deck-builder.  Light fun with varying paths, and a high emphasis on managing junk in your deck.  Takes a surprising amount of effort to set up and take down because you need to separate out 16 decks, 4 starting hands, and the board and blocks; for this reason, it seems like it would thrive best on computer.

I really like this take on deck building. It really does feel like Dominion with a board, but the board isn't a secondary part of the game. You can win by focusing solely on the board, or by focusing on your deck, or by doing a combination of the two. The theme is more present than in Dominion, but still kind of pasted on. It has more legs than Dominion out of the box, but I think the sheer variety provided by Dominion's expansions make it the better game, still.

Update: I think the new route cards from the upcoming expansion, coupled with a board made specifically for 2 players are going to make this game shine, but I've lowered my rating from an 8.5 to a 7 because we find the 2 player game to be a little lackluster.

RATING: 7
Trains offers a fresh combination of deckbuilding with area control that works together nicely. The incorporation of a board makes this game very innovative and highly replayable. Fighting for key spots is a major part of the fun and strategy. The theme comes through very well, even in the waste management aspect. Easy to learn and plays quickly. A solid game.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion]Dominion[/url] ripoff? yes! Even the VP and money cards cost the same. There is a Dutch saying for this, which translates: "It is better to steal something good than to invent something bad". It basically adjusts Dominion by blending Dominion with a board (alternative scoring), waste (useless cards and opportunity's to get rid off) and unlimited actions. If you like the train theme better than medieval, get this. But no need to have both Dominion and this game in your collection.

RATING: 6
I've only played one two-player game, so take the score with a grain of salt. I suspect much of the tension in the game comes from the escalated cost of growth on a crowded board. That really wasn't an issue in our game and it really was a high-speed race to completion with little strategy. I do suspect that game is best with 4. I could see myself much more challenged at that player count. I do worry about variability. The cards are all rather basic. However, the need to not only collect money and point cards, but also development cards for the board did make the strategy and experience here a little different from Dominion's.

This game is a ton of fun. The availability of 2player maps from GenCon 2014 and Rising Sun made a ton of difference. Its quick and simple.

It would have been great if they put a little more effort in the board artwork and the wooden rail markers (anything but small cubes would have been better). But nevertheless I really like the game, and any expansion will be strongly considered.

Dominion meets cube rail games. This certainly seemed like the one best chance for me to fall in love with deckbuilders as a fan of train games. Trains succeeds in adding a spatial component. It's also succesful in mitigating my two pet peeves with Dominion: huge combos and extreme deck thinning. But at its heart it's still a deckbuilder and if you don't enjoy Dominion you won't love this either. It's a good game and I rather play Trains than Dominon but given the time I mostly would prefer a pure railroad game. Although admittedly, it has this fastfood-like quality of deckbuilders that urge you to give it another try.

I enjoy it over the base dominion and think the board adds significantly to the game to allow for some player interaction (as otherwise it basically is the same as Dominion).

The issue keeping it down to a 7.5 is the light theme and the fact that the lay-track board mechanic just isn't done all that well. I love deck builders and would always enjoy playing this, but it really could use a freshening up to 2017 standards and I recommend Clank! instead.

I really enjoy many games that are obvious Dominion ripoffs. They made no effort to hide the fact that most of the game is completely stolen from Dominion. But it ends up working pretty well. I would like to play more to see if there are a lot of different strategies. I feel like the breadth of card options holds it back, but that's mainly because I'm comparing the feel of the game to Dominion and it seems to lack the capacity for extreme strategies that can be surprisingly effective in Dominion.

This is NOT 3 games in one. This is Dominion. Even the values and pricings of the cards have not changed. The base game is exactly the same. 

The one improvement (and the designers really deserve kudos for this) is that Actions and Buys are no longer limited. This makes the game more intuitive and is easier to teach to new players. 

The rest of the game focuses on putting cubes down on the board. There's nothing really difficult or clever here. Just try to be on the spaces with the most points at the end of the game.

Dominion the board game. The waste mechanism supported by the abilities to do as many actions and buys a turn as you can is the only actual thing in the game play differing from Dominion.

I know the train theme is supposedly a selling point for many gamers. Not for me though. For me that's one of the most boring themes out there. So it took a long time and a huge discount for me to get Trains. BUT... the game is great. Is it just Dominion with a board? Yes and no. Sure, it's a pretty basic deckbuilder. But the board adds more strategic options, more choices and more interaction. And despite the fact that I'm not excited about the train theme, it really comes through nicely. Something that you can hardly say about Dominion's "theme".

Am slightly surprised at the hype surrounding this. Yes its reasonable and enjoyable, but to listen/read the majority of the comments about this you might think its the second coming, or cold fusion or some such thing. Its a reasonable deck builder, easy to play and fairly quick, pretty much its Dominion with a board. Don't turn down a first play, but don't expect it to be the greatest invention since sliced bread. The truth is isn't nothing special, and Dominion has an edge in so much as it has more card choice in the base box alone..

One of the smoothest games I've ever played.  At some points we were carrying out our turns with the same efficiency that you see when watching those guys play dominoes in the park.  The waste mechanic is brilliant.  It's enough of a nuisance that you have to pay attention to it, but there are a number of clever ways to deal with it as well, so it doesn't break anything.  The base cards provide the necessities and the randomized cards provide the variety and it works beautifully.  All of the games felt different but retained a similar balance, and each deck build that I encountered featured different engines.  It's a simple, clean, fun game, and the quality of the cards is nice too.

This game was actually not so bad given my feelings about Dominion (rating a generous 2, I'd rather stick a needle in my eye than play again).  While watching Rahdo's walkthrough I kept recalling nightmares of playing Dominion however this appeared marginally better - I expected it would get a 3 rating from me simply because it would be slightly less painful than dominion.  But after having played the game, I've found it isn't that bad - I'll play it again but wouldn't buy it.  I think the fact that it has a more realistic, modern-era theme (rather than fantasy, horror, or medieval) makes it more palatable.  I'd prefer a US based map and would really like to see it based in the heyday of American steam railroads (that would trigger a buy).

Nagyon tetszik. A téma ellenére. Szerencsére nem nagyon érezni rajta a témát. :P Jobban belegondolva, nem nagyon van olyan deckbuilding, ami nem tetszett volna. Jó a térképes aspektusa a játéknak, még nem játszottam vele annyit, hogy kiderüljön, lehet-e úgy eredményesnek lenni, hogy azt a részt mellőzze az ember. Gyanítom, nem nagyon. A Waste kártyák egyrészt idegesítők kicsit, másrészt viszont érdekes elem, folyamatosan foglalkozni kell velük, és néha az a legjobb, amit megtehet az ember, hogy passzolja a körét, csak szabadulhasson tőlük. Összességében, szerintem nagyon ajánlható Dominion rajongóknak, akik nem idegenkednek ettől a témától, megjelenéstől.

Deck building/management game. Each game is different due to the "Randomizer" cards that set the cards for purchase. The game includes 20-30 unique card types so every play favors different strategies. You try to manage your deck while also managing a board with train stations and train tracks, increasing your points by being connected to larger cities.  Surprisingly fun for what is a potentially bland and unimaginative (and overdone) theme. Teaches in 15 min. Light-medium gameplay.

Dominion with a train theme and a board.

First off, lower rating because I do not really enjoy deck building games. 

That said I like this much more than dominion. But like other deck building games it felt more like a group game of solitare. Nothing really pushed us to engage against eachother so we tended to build our tracks in our own direction.

Needs a mechanic that forces players into more interaction.

RATING: 6.5
Played 3 player, the similarities with Dominion and its mechanics cannot be dismissed, however this is not Dominion. For starters there is a large hex map-board upon which you lay track, and build edifices and that is where the differences end. There are a number of piles of cards to draw from, three of which are cash cards ranging from 1-3, there are victory point cards valued 1, 2 & 4, there are a number of stacks of ability cards which allow you to do different things which range from laying track, swapping cash cards for higher value ones, building towers. the added twist is that there are monetary costs to most actions on the board, in addition you collect "waste" cards with any building actions which rapidly clog your hand. So does it work? - Yes most definitely and I want to try it again to see what strategies do work however I am not sure if it will stand the test of time.

Enjoyed the board play of this deck builder. In my first game, the board play proved to be a distraction to most of us when we should have focused on building our deck first.

Waste cards are gained by making plays on the board where most of your points are likely to come.  Looking forward to exploring this one more.

"Dominion with a board" is how Trains was described to me and sure enough, "Dominion with a board" is what it is. I'm not a big fan of Dominion because I feel like I'm just sitting there, doing my thing, moving cards around. The added board in Trains definitely gives you a "point" to what you're doing and a reason for the other people to be sitting at the table, so I agree that it's an improvement over the game that it's obviously derived from. That said, Dominion came out in 2008 and games have already moved on from its naked mechanism model to using the deckbuilding system to accomplish more. I already prefer Thunderstone, Nightfall, and Core Worlds to Dominion because they too add a point and more direct confrontation to the idea. Trains is an okay enough game, but it seeks to solve a five year old problem that has already been well conquered. I'd also say that, for me, the maps cause the additional problem of making me wonder why I'm not just playing Steam.

1 game with 3 players. My idea (lets not dignify it with the word strategy) was a combination of mail trains and utilising cash to buy victory point cards (Appartments, Towers etc) with only a little bit of interaction with the board and other players. It was good enough to get me a second place but a significant distance from first.

Though I am normally adverse to deckbuilding games this iteration of the mechanic was engaging.  The board provided a context for some choices and the theme was definitely embedded within the game rather than pasted on. 

As all the best deckbuilding games there is a variety of strategies, real pace to the game and various obstacles to overcome as you adapt to the earlier choices you have made.  The waste cards are a clever and have an internal logic within the game.  However, I found little variety within the majority of cards and disliked for me what was largely a solitaire game (though I admit that was in large part due to the "strategy" I had chosen).

Overall I think Trains moves deckbuilding forward with the odd idea but doesn't provide a rush of blood that the mechanic produced when it first emerged in the hobby.

Really nice game, the mechanics ensures a different game every time, lots and lots of cards with different values and powers, you can invest in some actions at the beginning of the game, and something different towards the end, sometimes being close to another player is an advantage, sometimes the best is to be isolated. instructions are somehow difficult but play is easy

This lovely deck builder for 4 people adds a central board for players to jostle over for territory. Taking on the role of Japanese rail companies, build your rail line to prestige and profitability by laying rails, connecting districts, and managing waste accumulated by your company.

I'm not a huge fan of deck building games, but I am a big euro gamer, so this one should have tickled my parts... it didn't...

It's possible I didn't have a good first game as I was playing with a couple of experienced deck builder players, and I just didn't 'grok' the rules right away, and it seemed over complicated to me, but with no need.

I also got hung up on the fact there was a useless score track around the board that seemed to have no use until endgame scoring - so why have it?

I'll give it another try though as only one play doesn't do it justice.

While the cards don't seem to have the diversity of Dominion and this game doesn't work for 2 players without printing a 2 player board yourself, the network building of this game adds a whole new dimension. It causes some tough decisions over when it is good to expand your board position vs your deck: wait too long on board position and you may have to inefficiently build through other people's tracks, but don't build your deck up enough and you'll be floundering come late game (but build up your tracks enough and you can force the game to be over before late game even develops). Also, while it doesn't have direct interaction piggybacking off your opponent's stations is a great way to get easy points, and snatching up certain areas so to force your opponents to accrue more waste can be quite profitable. Note that the amount that you should use the board varies widely depending on the available cards and your opponents' play styles. In certain cases you barely want to use it at all, at other times you will wish you had just a few more rail tokens. Overall a pretty easy to learn game with great depth. With an expansion I could easily see this toppling Dominion for me.

Pretty cool Dominion with a board. I liked it because it was Dominion with a spacial race aspect. Quite cool, the waste mechanism made sense and was something to take into account.

As long as the variability remains high I forsee a bright future and a rising rating. 

While it's not the pick up and deliver game that I had hoped it might be, it's an equally good route builder. I like the ability to offensively use stations to sap opponents liquid cash. There's a real challenge to stay as lean and mean with your deck building too.

This will see regular play for some time to come.

Dominion with a board?  That's a bad description, but an apt one.  There's some interesting competition for area going on, especially since high scoring plays can be symmetrical if your opponents decide to move into "your" cities.  Waste is a great mechanic, much more intuitive than curses and also easier to deal with (as they should be, since you pretty much just give them to yourself).

Rated after two plays, likely a few more to come.  Superior to Dominion because of the added spatial area control/area enclosure element.  Feels somewhat reminiscent to Steam's mechanic in understanding when to transition from deck-building to rail/VP building, akin to Steam's income-to-VP transition.  I like that it is quite possible to identify and pressure the leader, which is often impossible in Dominion.

12/27/2016: 8 - Variety of interesting strategies. Can focus on cards, or focus on the board. Great twist to the Dominion deck-building format.
12/27/2017: 7 - A little disappointed that it seems like the dominant strategy is to simply ignore the board and focus solely on the cards, which makes it just like another Dominion. We probably need to play a bit more to test and confirm. (Expansion helped.)

Deck building game where you also have a map where you are building stations on a board and trying to claim areas that will score for you.  

Scoring is more from placement on the map and less from the building cards in the game.

RATING: 7.5
A lighter version of deckbuilder. This game does many things right (or I should say, personal preference compared with Dominion):
1. The railway board makes much more player interaction, and makes the 'spot it' situation in Dominion virtually non-existant;
2. Excellent graphics;
3. Players need to adjust the card buy between turns as the board situation changes.
However, the gameplay is also more random compared with Dominion as many a time you need both action cards and money cards in single hand to get an action done. The situation is even worse and the hand would be progressively jammed by Waste cards.

Dominion with trains. 18X.Vaccarino? It's an okay game, but it doesn't get me excited. Ostensibly, the addition of a ma to the Dominion system should add a degree of player interaction and increased competition, and to an extent, it does. The game features the same sort of route-planning and engineering that is present in any good train game, although making your deck fit your plan (or visa versa) is a challenge that detracts from the Train element. Ultimately your focus has to be on building a deck that will enable you to do what your plan requires.

And this is where the game really falls flat for me; as a deckbuilder, there's nothing new or exciting here. Many of the cards are just equivalent versions of Dominion base-game cards, but there's none of the really exciting and powerful combos here.

Genre mashups can be a great thing when their sum exceeds the individual parts, but this is not the case here. You've got a mediocre deckbuilder with a mediocre train game laid overtop, and the end result, while new and interesting, is nonetheless mediocre.

It occurred to me that one of the potential problems is that this game takes much longer to play than Dominion, but on second thought, I'm not sure a shorter play time would make any difference to the bland core.

Dominion with a board. The addition of area control makes for a much more interesting game than Dominion, imo. This game is not perfect, however. In some ways it feels like only 75% of a game, like they could have fleshed it out some more. Maybe upcoming expansions will help. The game also doesn't scale very well from 2 to 4 players. With three or four bumping into your opponents is a given. With two you can completely stay out of each other's way, basically making for solitaire.

I don't care for Dominion anymore so it's surprising that I really enjoy this game since the card play is identical for the most part. The added dimension of the board makes the game.

Deckbuilding with a board, I like the concept. I also love train games usually, so I expected to like this and I'm not disappointed.
After a while (about 10 games) it started to feel less interesting, and unfortunately the expansions for the German versions were cancelled so I never got the chance to rekindle my interest in this game. Maybe I might pick up the English version with expansions someday, or maybe I will just stick with Dominion for deck-building.

RATING: 4
Of the wave of deckbuilders that flooded the gaming world in the years after Dominion, the ones I liked took the inspiration of building your deck as you play and then tried to forge their own path from there.

Trains firmly sits in the other camp, that of stricly derivative games. Its claim to originality is the placement of the card engine into a train game frame, but that engine has been lifted wholesale from Dominion. Where this act should be placed in the grey area between the sincerest form of flattery and intellectual theft is very much a matted of personal taste.

What I perceive as a more pressing problem during actual play is whether the two parts of Trains (i.e. route building and the Dominion engine) are as well integrated as they could and should be. As an example, is the 0/1-3/2-6/3 progression of train (i.e. money) cards really the best fit for this game? How about the starting hand of five cards from an initial deck of ten? Would a hypothetical immaculate conception of Trains have arrived at these exact numbers?

These are, I feel, more than mere idle questions, since they have a perceivable impact on the game, and that impact could have been optimized a good deal more. Luck of the draw tends to even out in Dominion, because timing is mostly just important at the end of the game. In Trains, however, a bad hand can cost you a crucial building opportunity that will be gone or considerably more expensive when you'll draw a better hand.

Could this have been smoothed a bit, maybe with a finer grain for the economy than values of 1/2/3, or more planning by carrying one unplayed card over into the next round? There's no indication that any development efforts in this direction were attempted, there's really nothing her but grafting Dominion to a train game. And, admittedly, adding the idea of waste cards (more harmless curses) as an additional cost for many cards.
And for me, that's just nowhere near enough to justify playing this.

I've played once only, and haven't even seen most of the cards, so take that into consideration with my thoughts.  I'm glad I tried it and I'd play again, but I think I just prefer Dominion.

A deck building game a bit like Dominion but with some notable differences: 1. There are cards which allow you to build train routes and stations on a map as an alternative way to score points, 2. You may play an unlimited amount of actions and buys on your turn, 3. You take "waste" cards when performing some actions which clog up your deck until you find a way to remove them. I really enjoyed playing this for the first time at Essen. Need more plays to form a better opinion.

Instantly killed Dominion for me.

Rating Potential: I can see the rating going down over time, and I'm not 100% on some replay issues. Some spots on the board do seem to be better than others, but until further plays, I don't know that. I don't see the rating going down that much though. At worst this is in the 7 range but might retain the 8+ simply for killing Dominion for me. I'm not sure if it can reach a 9 due to it not playing that well as a 2-player game. Expansions will fix that, but I'm rating it as a base game only.

Best deckbuilding theme. Nice artwork and theme. Cubes suck, I've moved my Ticket to Ride Märklin trains to the box instead. Most of the flaws of Dominion have been fixed, but sadly deckbuilding has some unfixable permanent flaws: constant suffling, and quite long post-game cardsorting time; there could be bit more varied cards too. Expansion adds more varied cards and also makes the actual routebuilding more relevant, it's bit pricey but so good.

Wow does this play fast! On my first game it came down to a VP difference of 1 Tower between first place and me in second. Because it plays so fast you don't get the time to appreciate other player's turns as much as in other games I play: I really like seeing what everyone else is doing, so I missed this aspect. Perhaps as we get better we won't need to focus on what we're doing so much and will be able to "sit back" a little.

So, at play #5 it's time to rate the game. Game number 5 was very interesting: the winner started by focussing on building up her deck without gaining waste and always seemed to have massive amounts of money available. However, she built much less track than the two other players and only won by 1 point. It was an odd game because hardly anyone bought Station Expansion cards and the game end when I ran out of cubes, not when the Station Markers ran out (as it had in every other game I've played).

Even on game 5 we saw new cards that we haven't used before, leading to new approaches to the game. We can play 3P in an hour from boxed game to re-boxed game. Brilliant 'long filler'! This has got to be an 8

Now played with the additional maps (printed on neoprene) and upgraded to a 9.

I really like the variability in strategies depending on which eight random sets of cards are used.  I have won with all my tracks on the board as well as with only a few. I also like that you can try to force or delay the endgame depending on whether you are getting points from a money engine or from the board.  The three endgame conditions seem well balanced, generally speaking.

Also looking forward to different maps, new cards, and route bonuses.

Dominion has been one of my top rated games for awhile so I assumed I would enjoy this one.  Unfortunately for Dominion, Trains might overtake it as a favorite.  I love what the board adds to the game in regard to multiple strategies and just general visual/tactile appeal.  Setup takes longer than Dominion, but play is quick and smooth.  Every turn generally allows for good progress and meaningful decisions, even with a crummy draw.  Waste cards allow the game to progress quickly while still requiring good deck planning and management.  I'm holding on to Dominion for sentimental reasons, but I definitely see it's play diminishing due to Trains.

My only complaint is how many Waste cards you can rack up entirely too easily. A worthwhile purchase that looks more fun as you play and build your networks & expansions.

Not normally a deck-building fan but I really, really liked this game.  Maybe it was the map and the theme that made it come together, and I could 'see' what I was doing, but now I really want to own it.  Not so many different cards but it is really tough to make choices, and love how the rubbish gets in your hand the more you expand, forcing you to deal with it.  

5/17:  Holy crap, a gap of four years in plays!  A lot of fun.  Played the AEG version with extra cards and also entertaining.  I don't think I will play enough to merit the expansion, but the attack cards are kind of fun.  Also, the routes add something.

I'm not a Dominion fan, so I wasn't holding my breath for Trains. I thought the board looked nice and the card art was nice. I didn't think the colors of the card faces made much sense it was hard to figure out the card types from a quick glance. The cards also weren't cut even. If I ran my thumb down the side of my deck, I could feel ridges where wider cards were sticking out of the deck. This is pretty unacceptable for a $60 game from a company that also makes a popular CCG. 


Gameplay wise, I thought the board was an interesting touch. I'm not sure how many plays you could get out of a board before it gets samey, but I thought it was interesting. We did screw up the cost rules for building on occupied hexes, though. The cards were awfully similar to the Dominion cards when looking at the actions and the waste cards were more of an annoyance than a hindrance.

Box art is mediocre and we almost didn't buy this game - weren't quite sure - seemed bland and there were very few reviews at the time, but those few reviews were very positive and we took a chance.

This is an EXCELLENT deck builder and we prefer it to Dominion.  The board strategy adds an extra strategic and aesthetic element.  The card art is really cool - so well done, they look like real photos.  Train themes are always excellent too, so that is just a bonus.  We do find it takes about 75 minutes for a 4p game, not the 45 min advertised.  A mainstay in our collection.

I love [gameid=36218]; I don't believe anything will ever replace it. I'm not impressed by "innovations" such as grafting a fantasy theme on and making it suck more; or magnifying the randomness by introducing dice. That said, I can see the desire to augment the deckbuilding by having something going on on a board, and this Dominion/Steam hybrid does that reasonably well. 

I wanted the action on the board to be a little more interesting - like, I don't know, maybe some connection-based scoring? Many of the cards were obvious clones of Dominion cards, even down to the cost ("OK, I'll buy a Mine"). And, I don't think the variation in "kingdom" cards (or whatever they're called - traindom?) is going to present enough variation in strategy from game to game. Like, is it a good idea to buy a third "Lay Tracks" card early? I don't know, but if it is, it's always going to be. 

Now, none of these are deal-breakers. I'd play again. The components are nice, the graphic design is clean. The double-sided board is impressive. Not a buy for me, but the buzz is understandable.

I'm quite mixed on this. It's been called "Dominion with a board" which is quite accurate. In my one play the winner ignored the board entirely and took a very generic Dominion strategy, buying VP cards. I'm sure the viability of that strategy varies with the card selection. Certainly Dominion wins on the strength of its expansion if variety is important to you. Does Trains bring a worthwhile difference to the genre? Maybe. Is the board a good, balanced alternative? A distraction? The only path? I can't tell yet. I know I wasn't excited enough to track down future plays, but I don't feel confident enough based on my first play to pass judgement. I say to its fans, enjoy! To its detractors, ignore!

Very average game that really does nothing to truly stand out. Sure, it adds a board to Dominion, but it does just that. It's a bore, and if you don't play with the right cards (that allow trashing) deck bloating is such an incredible problem it's hardly worth it.

The board features no real interaction either (sure building in someone's spot is more expensive but never prohibitively so). A disappointment.

After additional plays it turns out you can be more careful with rubble, so can deal better with it than indicated earlier

The good; it's a coherent, well-themed deck-builder which really does seem to be as much about the board and building as it is about the cards.  

The bad; many of the elements seem lifted wholesale from Dominion. 10 cards, 7 cash, 3 others, draw 5 a turn.  Sound familiar?  You'd think that thorough testing would reveal at least minor tweaks to the numbers for better play, but no...

Not a bad game by any means, but to me it sure seems like a particular strategy is terribly overpowered (whether it is or not has been hotly debated).  Also, 2P doesn't seem to shine as well as it could.  It's not going to win with my wife over dominion or our other deckbuilders, so out it goes.

About three or four plays in I experienced a burst of enthusiasm for this game, only to have it settle back down again. As much as I admire the design I'm finding play to be a bit bland, especially with two players. It can really be a bore with a bad set of randomized cards. Thank goodness for cards like Amusement Park and Tourist Train.

I've read that an expansion is in the works. Good: a greater variety of cards (including a few that generate some player interaction perhaps?) and more maps will definitely help. Actually, there are several new maps on file already--the one set in the Northeast US is fun. [10 plays]

The game definitely evokes Dominion.  I enjoy Dominion, so not surprisingly, I enjoy Trains as well.  That said, I'm not convinced that the two games feel differently enough to be worth keeping both in my collection.  In other words, even with the addition of the board and perhaps a stronger theme, there's still a huge overlap with Dominion.

Nevertheless, it's a good game and I enjoy it.

This takes the Dominion mechanic to a completely new level and wow how it works! If you are familiar with Dominion then you can recognise a lot of the cards.

HIGHLY RCOMMENDED.

This is a nice deck-builder and I believe the first to add a board element to it. There is a large variety of cards and boards available, but I don't know if these expand replay-ability, or are just varied for the sake of it (all plays might feel too similar). As with the other game in the same line (Automobiles) I worry that for larger player counts, you rely too much on other players helping to keep the scores close (building in the wrong place can just give points to opponents) so think this'll be most competitive at 2.

This game looks soooo boring, and truth be told, it IS boring.  It's also very well-made, plays fast, and having a board is a definite improvement on the deck-building formula.

Despite being a very good game, however, I have a hard time getting past the boring board, boring card artwork, and boring theme. I'm happy to have it in my collection, and I always enjoy the times I play it, but it's a hard game to get super excited about playing.

A great game. In Dominion the decision is mostly on what to buy and not how you play the cards. The board in Trains opens up another dimension, needing to fight for positions on board in addition to consider what to buy, and more importantly how you playthe cards! The framework of the game is excellent, while it currenty might not be as deep as Dominion with all the expansions, it will only get better. 

Update after 5 plays: I think this game isn't too replayable. If you are an experienced Dominion player, you will understand what the best strategy is after seeing the cards available, then it's mostly about execution - the tactical aspect of the game depends entirely on the cards you buy. (the thoughts of what cards to buy is pre-determined indeed)

RATING: 8.5
Trains is my favorite deck-building game, because of the way it uses the mechanics of deck-building in combination with a physical board. I'm a visual person, so I don't do well with games like Dominion, which visually take place almost entirely inside your imagination. My score can more accurately be taken as a combined score for Trains and Trains: Rising Sun, as the latter adds many much-needed methods for dealing with waste cards, the cards which act as deck-killing by-products to your constant building. Compelling, thorough in its commitment to the setting, and different every time thanks to the numerous different card combinations, this is my pick for the best locomotive board game.

In Japan, one is laying track and building stations in a city. This is a card driven game that copies the mechanics in Dominion except there is a board. Laying track or building station generates waste, which will clog up your hand. Just like Dominion, you will score VPs for cards, and stations on the board will give you 2 VP per station, except a 3 cluster station will give you 8 VPs. Game ends when 4 stacks run out, a players track cubes run out (you have 20 of them), or the 30 stations run out.

Despite the blatant copying of Dominion, I enjoyed this game. I think it is what Dominion could have been. I have some concerns about the player order since the person going first gets to place first on the map which is an advantage, and the other players are not compensated accordingly. It's addictive, and I'm looking forward to more plays.

Trains is a simple network-building game where actions are decided by cards drawn from a personal deck. Player's decks can be added to by buying cards from a market. Basically Dominion with a board.

Because it ripped Dominion off, players can use Dominion game play strategies, ignore the board entirely, and remain competitive which is a glaring problem.

Another problem is that players who focus on branching out on the board at game start are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase many new cards as their decks will become choked with the ever-present Waste cards necessitating spending several turns purging them from their decks for purchases to be made.

A main aspect of deck-building is the ability to remove obsolete cards from one's deck. There is only one card capable of 'trashing' in Trains and it is not a mainstay in the market, but may only randomly appear during set-up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A Dominion style deck building game...but with a board! This game is innovative and clever. The most interesting mechanic to the game is the collection of Waste. It builds up in your deck so quickly and really makes the game a lot of fun. There seems to be a lot of smack talk when fellow players have to take their waste, which creates a really fun atmosphere to the game. 

As in Dominion there are Victory point cards that clog your deck and hand...but the waste is far more intrusive (maybe more similar to taking Curses in Dominion). The difference being the waste will be there in every game. Most of the victory points will however come from the board. Careful expansion to big cities and building plenty of stations will really bring in tons of points at game end.

If you have people in your game group that swear they hate train games, this one is so different they may just like it. Especially, if you already know they enjoy Dominion.

RATING: 5
Probably the least sexy title of all time, although I think that's pretty common with Euros. If I had to market this game it sound something like this: "It's a simple deck-building game! With area majority and route building as the mechanics!" Trains is not a terrible design for a game and turns are fast. However, the idea just bores the shit out of me. I favor mechanics over story but I'd like a little narrative, a little personality, a little "zsa zsa zsu" as Carrie once put it. Perfectly fine game but could be better with a little theme to it.

I was expecting the map to provide more direction and more dimension, similar to how Fantastiqa does, but in the end it seems it's just a means to determine the cost of playing the "lay rails" card in your deck. Each time you play that card, you place another token onto the board (costs are increased if someone's already built in that space), and you want to spread to the city spaces where someone has built stations. Or build stations in your own city spaces yourself. In effect, each station is equivalent to taking a VP card, except it doesn't clog up your deck. Or if it's all getting too costly on the board, just buy VP cards. You get a random selection of card types to buy and build your deck with, but it's all Dominion-esque and therefore a bit same-y, and the board isn't enough to differentiate it, so you end up asking why bother with it and why not just play Dominion instead with its broader variety. Adding the waste cards (equivalent to wounds in Legendary but much more prevalent here) just makes for a longer game without more interesting decisions - just the occasional decision to forego a turn and trash the waste cards. If you don't have Dominion, the game works just fine and is pleasant to play. It just suffers a bit in comparison to others of its ilk.

Every gamer out there needs to try this !!

Build train routes over modern day Japan via deck-building! Very cool game! Plays nice with 2 players, but the game really shines with more players, as train routes get more expensive to build when the board fills up more, and the card piles tend to deplete faster. Good feeling to this game. Easy to teach, and learn. AEG's 2013 reprint is excellent. Graphics are cool.

You do NOT have to know/like/love 18xx games in order to love this game.

Warning: decks will clog up due to the waste mechanism. Waste management is part of the game, and adds to the chaos.

RATING: 7
"Solid deck management plus a map. It's not clear whether it really can be played non-cutthroat."

What I like:
- Board play adds a lot to the deck management
- Quick (50 minutes for 4p learning game)
- Our one play had very little conflict

What I don't like:
- It doesn't feel as thematic as some people say
- Might have to be played cutthroat if you want to win
- Maps are highly abstracted

I'm not sure how I feel about the map. If it really can be played "friendly", like our first 4p game, then I could really enjoy it. But if you really have to be aggressive to do well (as in Carc, TtR, and RotW), then I won't. 

I think the 2.6 weight is about right. I might put it slightly lower.

Sure this game takes a lot from other games, but it merges deck building with a little of board play. You build your deck with fairly standard deck building mechanics but can also "lay track" and get points on the board. One interesting aspect is that you constantly get waster, which are useless cards, so you have to really manage that or your deck will just be full of waste and your combos will never work.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed  my first few plays of this,  but after a while I realized I was less focused on my opponent in this game than any other game I own.  Players pay almost no attention to each other at all.  You almost have to yell "I have 4 dollars this hand and I am going to buy this card" and even then, no one really cares.  The blocking on the board is almost nonexistent since it is quite easy to get into a city someone has built stations in and therefore share the points.  So it's basically play your game as efficiently as you can and compare scores at the end.  There is a bit of interaction in that someone's strategy can rush the ending, so in that sense there is a bit to pay attention to.  But it isn't enough.

This felt like more of a Dominion clone than most deckbuilders I've played.  You had piles of cards just like Dominion, with money cards (trains), victory point cards (buildings), and a bunch of action cards--many of which were just translated from Dominion cards.  There were two major differences.  First, this has a board, and many cards allow you to play to the board; this was just an additional (but important) way to score points.  Second, the concept of "waste"--almost every positive action you take makes you put a waste card or two in your deck.  These just clog things up, and you can spend a turn to trash all the waste cards in your hand.  I didn't really feel this was different enough from Dominion to warrant much attention.  If you think that Dominion needs board play, sure, give it a try.

What a fantastic game. I've only played this once, but I was already debating on a 10. The game plays a bit longer than Dominion but with the added board and having to focus on getting your track/stations out makes it more involved. My only complaint so far is the card quality. We'll see how well it holds up after a dozen plays.

Interesting balance between deck enhancing vs rail network building. Deck building part of the game is rather straightforward with less variability in card abilities than say, Dominion Intrigue, but on par with vanilla Dominion. The map adds an interesting layer of strategy though, your rail network gives major part of the final score but building it makes your deck worse (adds no value/no use cards called Waste). There are ways to remove those cards but you will certainly acquire more than you can get rid of. There are afterall, 70 waste cards in stock - that should give a hint.

RATING: 8
Very good deck building track laying hybrid game.  It felt like a cross between Dominion and Chicago Express.

I liked how it had the trains as "currency" and the actions to lay track or a station.  I like how every action pretty much generated waste.  I liked how this game had more options to reduce waste from one's hand.  The turns seemed a little quicker without having +action cards.  I also liked the board, which brought an additional element to focus on vs typical deck building games.

My main concern was that it felt more "solitaire" versus Dominion.  Its deck building engine also seemed harder to get going, since I was often hampered not having the trains to lay track or vice-versa.

Obviously, this design was heavily influenced by Dominion. Trains strives to bring the deckbuilding mechanism to the next level by adding an element of laying track and building station on the board. I'm happy to say that it mostly succeeds in the attempt. Like Dominion, turns are usually very quick, and the whole game lasted less than 60 minutes with 4 new players. Different sets of cards available each game, and the variety of maps already available should provide quite a bit of replayability. This one might end up on my wishlist soon enough.

Got to play this hot game that sold out at CSI thanksgiving sales today at my local meetup. 

I gotta say this game is different than Dominion where big money doesn't work since there are so much wastes to be going around. This game is a tight race to the finish when the train stations run out, because it is so clear that train stations give out the most VPs at the end of the game. The card VP is just there as a reminiscing of VPs in Dominion. A good player will always lay down tracks and stations instead of those.

It is a different enough game but I still like Dominion better. I am glad that I've got a chance to play it though.

You can call this Dominion (a game I like a lot :-) with a board :D, but a very good implementation of the board as you can get some really nice points from there and you have to consider spending your money on building tracks are buying some nice extra cards. Also a good feature is that you sort of chose to take 'a curse' (which is Waste in this game) as those Waste-cards are connected to certain actions. But by just passing (hopefully with a lot of Waste in your hand at that moment) you get rid of them.

This is really the next generation of 'Dominion' style deck building games. It's key innovation is that it introduces a spatial element through a board. Also, "waste" (useless cards) are added to your deck, so a key part of the game is working out the best way to get rid of them. A Pretty good game, but definitely light fare for beginners and families.

RATING: 8
Very solid Dominion-with-a-board. It shows that you don't need much extra to turn an excellent game (Dominion) into a very different and still just as excellent game (Trains).

With less focus on efficiency, there's more room for different strategies that aren't simply inferior versions of the fastest-to-the-most-provinces one. And player interaction is not just negative like in Dominion, but you can actually profit from your opponents, which is more fun.

Cards are pretty basic, and not balanced all that well. There are a couple that are clearly always great to have (draw two cards) and a couple that are very situational (gain a copy of a train card in your hand). That's a serious issue for a game that's essentially about which cards to buy. Luckily Trains comes with enough cards to allow you to create interesting setups.

Dominion but with a board game component. No longer is building a good "engine" enough to win like in Dominion. In trains you have ever changing conditions on the board that you need to be able to manage with your hand. A very clever variation on the deck builder genre.

A good deck-builder with a lot going on. I like the addition of the board, both to add a bit more to think about (compared to a straight deck-builder like Dominion) and to give more interaction between the players. I like the decisions around the waste cards that accompany most good actions but also clog up your deck. I like that there are multiple paths to getting points, so you could have a strategy of dominating the cities on the map, or buying building cards, or something else depending on what cards are available that game.
Trains is very similar to Dominion, with a board, and I do feel like this game is strictly better than Dominion. The only core concept of Dominion that is not present here is the engine-building you have to do to get more actions or buys during your turn. I didn't miss that at all, and the addition of the board greatly enhances the gameplay.

An excellent version of a Dominion-type card game combined with a railway development board game.

Huge variability in terms of only using 8 out of 30 decks of 'Kingdom'-type cards per game which gives 23 million combinations to try out.  Then you play on 1 of 2 maps and have hundreds of possible start position combinations, and can play as 2, 3 or 4 player games.  So must be thousands of years of game play without repeating any start of game situation!!!

Managing the accumulation of Waste cards is an important part of the game.

Deck building with a board! What's not to like?
You can build a nice deck to expand on the board and also get VP cards, though each of those actions gives you a waste card. But it's also not too difficult to trash those waste cards. Some of the card combos can be quite powerful, but all in all great concept well implemented.

Have played twice and taught the game once and really enjoyed it.

PLUSES: Rivals Dominion for deck building satisfaction (not as complex, easier to teach, turns are simpler and quicker to play), LOVE the waste mechanic, and who doesn't love or relate to trains?

MINUSES (All of these are minor quibbles compared to the plusses): Boards are functional but uninspiring--I like a more realistic map; replaying on the same boards may get to be repetitive or the boards may get "solved" (only repeated plays will reveal this, though--there may be enough play in them to outlast this possibility). The limited selection of cards may also impact replayability. However, both these worries are about what future play may be like after many times playing, and I don't anticipate they will impact enjoyment in the near future--enough to outlast my groups' interest until the next interesting game comes along. If you play several times a week (which I can't), then these concerns may manifest themselves earlier. Wish there was a mechanic where points are recorded on the track during the game (there is only one card that does this) to maintain tension during game. 

Since I have two friends who own this game, I will be looking to acquire Trains Rising Sun and additional maps.

After one play: Wanted to like this one more than I did. But I won't write it off without a few more plays to see what some of the other cards are like. First impression: a deck-builder melded with a rail-laying game on a map board. I felt like there are several better deck-builders and lots of better rail-laying games, and combining the two didn't add any luster. Don't get me wrong: it's an enjoyable, playable game; but it didn't strike me as anything special.

I know that this is a rip off of Dominion, but I'd still play this any day over that. The addition of the game board adds a great element on top of the deck building mechanic.

Considering how much I enjoy deck builders I felt I had to give this game a try.  I am very glad to have picked it up.  Great theme and nice artwork make this a pleasant game to look at.

I find the "waste" mechanic a lot of fun and very thematic.  Try and build a nice railroad with minimal environmental impact.  It's always a tricky balance between managing waste and expanding your railroad.  

The board is a nice addition, but I almost wish they had done even more with it - maybe a pick up and deliver aspect?  Perhaps it would make it too cluttered, not sure.  Regardless it adds another dimension to a fun game.

If you enjoy deck builders, this one is worth trying out.

A good deck building game that kind of uses the Dominion system but in a backward way.  Most of the time you pay up front and then use actions. There is lot of room on the board with 2 probably better with 3 or 4.  Good things with this game its pretty easy to get the swing of it.  Overall an interesting variant of the dominion system but not quite as fun or interesting in my opinion.  Dominion is a great game and this isn't far from it so it is a solid game.  I would play this with 3 and especially 4 rather than dominion but if I only had two, Dominion would be my choice.

It's a great deckbuilder, but is it also a great train game? After several plays i'm still a bit in the dark on this one. I don't know if I like the fact, that you can compete without laying rails, and that it's usually the best strategy. It feels like it's against the theme of the game. That being said, it can be house ruled, and I will definitely be playing this a lot going forward, but I don't get the "building a great infrastructure"-feeling of Ticket To Ride. Maybe it's the artwork of the map and the use of cubes ...

Pretty good version of Dominion.  I felt there wasn't as much to strategize about in terms of trying to draft the right combination and number of cards, and it was more about how efficiently you got points on the board, which I found less interesting.  But mainly it's not different enough from Dominion - I would just prefer to play Dominion.

This game is fairly enjoyable. Gameplay is almost identical to Dominion except there is an added strategy of laying rail on the board.it is  not a bad game. 

Pros:  easy gameplay, fast quick play with little down time. Beautiful card art

Cons: poor compnent quality, bland board art, not extreme variety in play.  Abstract play doesnt seem to fit the theme.

Trains has two things that I really enjoy: trains and deck pooling. I think trains lend themselves very well to designing a game and I adore the deck pooling mechanic.

However, this game falls slightly off its tracks. It is fun to play. It is just not a great game, but nor is it bad. It is simply mediocre.

Trains is basically the same deck pooling mechanic as Dominion. While there is nothing new or innovative there, it is certainly tried and true. Players then use the deck pooling to build a rail connection of cities.

While Trains is rail building themed it does not give the player that great "train game" feeling. That is because the train theme is not essential to the game. This is a deck pooling game with a pasted on train theme, which is odd in-and-of itself. Most deck pooling game have little or no theme at all and what little theme is there is truly pasted on. At least Trains tries to build the theme into the game and this theme gives the deck pooling a purpose.

Trains does have one major drawback and for me is where the game falls flat. The rule book is written extremely poorly. The rules use different terms for the same item which causes major confusion when trying to decipher exactly what is meant. In fact, the rules even have two examples that give two completely different rules interpretations. In the end the rules are very unclear and difficult to learn from. This games desperately needs a better written rule book.

Pros - 
- Good deck pooling
- Tries to put a workable theme into a mechanic that typically has no theme

Cons -
- Extremely poor rules
- Pasted on theme

Dominion doesn't need a board :shake:

See my comment on Roll for the Galaxy for the flowchart of how critical reception plays out for this kind of game.

UPDATE. It's amusing to me, a few years later, to observe how the opinion has shifted on Trains. I remember when it was first released, it was heralded by so many. That's all gone now. I never see anyone playing this; it's been years since I saw this game on a table. It occupied a weird, brief, backlash anti-Dominion wave. It crested, it receded.

I remember when Trains came out--and with it so many Dominion haters--I remember thinking, "if Donny X. had designed Trains, all the critics who are trumpeting it now would have--instead--[i]ripped his skin off[/i]. The articles write themselves: [i]'Reeking of desperation, Donald Vaccarino adds a board to Dominion...'[/i]"

I've never seen a worse theft of another designer's ideas than I saw in Trains...

This is one of my two favorite Dominion style deck builders (the other being Arctic Scavengers). The board really makes this game an improvement over Dominion. It gives a tangible reason for building your deck and creates some interaction with the other players. Great game, even if the theme is not the most exciting. Doesn't feel pasted on though so that's nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Update: Almost two years after my initial play with the first edition and the AEG is very much an improvement in the artwork. Storing for a quick setup is easy enough if you separate the start cards, but a Dominion compartmentalised insert would have helped greatly. Doesn't rise in the ratings because the improved artwork is detracted from by a ridiculously oversized box. Why, oh why - how much shelf presence does one exactly need? Simplified building costs during explanation to terrain cost + 1 per wooden piece on the space. Definitely preferring this to Dominion due to the theme, waste cards and board interaction.
-----------
A very pleasant Dominion clone that adds a more meaningful theme and a board on which to compete over and interact with your opponents. Then add the constant accumulation of waste cards, plus a more relaxed approach to the number of actions and purchases you can make in a turn and you've got a game that would be one of my first deck building choices to pick off the shelf. Looking forward to playing further just for the fun of it. Did I mention the different maps?

My only fault with it would be that it needs a bigger publisher for better distribution and to give the rather uninspiring artwork a makeover.

Want to get more plays of this in during the coming months.

RATING: 8
 It is probably a little too easy to describe this as Dominion with a board, but I do not think that is an accurate explanation. This game is clearly inspired by Dominion but it adds a lot more to the standard formula. Even more so than Dominion, Trains is a game of optimization. Waste is going to constantly build up, and the best play is the way that finds ways to use the available cards to manage that waste as efficiently as possible. The board adds an additional layer of optimization, as players need to figure out each turn the best way to get the most points on the board. This aspect is what I really enjoy about the game because it means the game stays tactical throughout the play. It can be beneficial to deviate from the set strategy to jump in on a station that an opponent took the effort to build. This added tactical nature adds a lot to the game and it makes every game play unique.

This was about as good as I expected it to be and I think that it will only get better as I get used to how the cards work.  The waste element is cool and I recommend downloading the player boards so you can keep track of the cards gained so you don't forget to take waste.  I also like how it is hard to rid yourself of it unless you pass a turn - a nice subtle catchup mechanic that has been slid in there.  Well done, simple, and easy to teach.  I also like that the play time listed is very accurate, even with new players.

Dominion with a board. Uhm. Period. 

And start of the next sentence.

Actually there are many improvements over Dominion. Firstly there's thematic integration - the game makes sense and the way cards interact is somewhat logical. Secondly the game is more tactical - it's still shuffle, play stuff, breath in, and it's your turn again. But. Waste cards provide for an interesting thematic and mechanical twist - it will clog your deck and you have to find your way around it. And the board with spacial play. Points on the board are (at least in AEG version) more important and easier to reach than the big point cards. As far interaction goes - there is some possibility of blocking and/or leeching. Still, with fast turns and shuffling you won't notice much more than what your immediate neighbour is doing. The best part about the board play is that is gives the game a bit of narrative and a sense of progression. 

Probably best for people who dislike fantasy and have been waiting for a realistically themed deckbuilder.

RATING: 8
Interesting deckbuilder where players are expanding rail networks with their cards. VPs are scored Dominion-style by purchasing VP buildings BUT the extra layer is the accompanying board. 

Cards allow players to place and expand rail lines (ie cubes) across said board. VPs are scored for occupying certain spaces or putting stations in city spaces where your rail tokens are. The other novel mechanic is the concept of 'waste'. Many things you do gains you waste: essentially cards that clog your deck and have NO effect.

First plays indicate a well-balanced, well-playtested map and card combos. All in a really good effort and a fresh take on this popular genre. Also, with 30 card types to choose from and two maps (for if you count the Essen expansion), the base game offers quite abit of replayability.

One knock is that the overall presentation is a little drab. Cards are dull gray and trying to squeeze English and Japanese text on the cards is a great idea for playability but leaves little room for a nice central graphic. The box design itself is plain and looks like clip art meets mid-1990s photoshop graphics.

Looking forward to this being published by a larger publisher (Queen Games anyone?).

PS: Manage that waste!

First of all we spent some time sorting the material... Just imagine that Dominion was sold with unsorted cards.

The game consists of a deck building part very similar to Dominion, and a train building part similar to a number of train games. What happened was the totally predictable: Juho as the train gamer concentrated mostly on the game board and looked at the cards only as much as necessary, whereas I as the Dominion gamer concentrated on the cards and largely ignored the trains. The fun thing is that you can actually get your victory points either from the cards (buying Skyscrapers=Provinces) or from the tracks, so as far as I can tell, it mostly feels like two entirely separate games coincidentally going on on the same table. (That being said, it might be a way to make both
types of gamers happy at the same time.)

RATING: 7
Nice merger of dominion style deck building and a simple train game, though you really have to go after points on the board more than in the cards to win.

On the fence on this one.  Kind of clunky at times...and the art is not quite there for me.  But I don't know of any deck building game that does player interaction as well and it's nice to have a board.  Need to play it again for a more solid rating.

Egy az egyben Dominion csak egy térképet is adtak hozzá. Valahogy úgy éreztem, hogy a kártyák is egy az egyben a térképen való történésekre mennek rá főként, így nekem még könnyedebb is volt, mint a nagy előd. Összefüggő vasutakat építenek a játékosok, pont azért jár, ha városba eljutunk, ahol van állomás. Vannak városok, amelyekben több állomás is épülhet, ami több pontot ad majd a játék végén. Különböző területtípusokon többe kerül az építés és az érdekesség, hogy mindenért szemét lap jár, ami csak foglalja a helyet a paklinkban. A téma mindenképpen közelebb áll hozzám, mint a Dominion témája és szebb is a játék. 1 ponttal többet adok rá, de nem feltétlenül jobb ennyivel.

Trains is one of my favorite games. The board brings this deckbuilder to life. 


PROS:
There are several viable strategies for winning. 
It is relatively easy to teach.
It is tense throughout.
It is easy to look back at where you went wrong and make adjustments for next time.

CONS:
Many of the cards are not useful.
No expansions. 

UPDATE: 
The game may fall into the same trap as dominion where avoiding all cards but money and VP rules king over all other strategies. I have played two games not laying any rails or stations but only buying cards and have won both by a substantial amount. I hope that as others catch on and buy some of those cards out from under me I will be forced to play the board. If not, I will lower the rating.

A must-play deck-building game. The decks of cards that form the shop are reminiscent of those from Dominion (a game I thoroughly did not enjoy), however the board is what makes this game a stand-out from others of the genre. Although each player is building their own deck, each player's placement of rail lines and stations means that players can directly affect each other and make it more difficult for others to share in the VPs on the board.

Interesting Deck-builder, similar to Dominion but with a board and a unique waste mechanic that I quite like (As your deck gets ruined by waste rather than through victory points, which always bothers me about Dominion, which means you can consistently build your engine rather than aim for a 'tipping point' which can be frustrating).

This is a fine game but I'm not sure there is a reason to own it next to Core Worlds, Dominion, Legendary, Shadowrift, and a couple other deck builders.  It simply isn't different enough to give me an experience I don't already get from my other deck builders, and usually better.  Deck builders are one of my wife's favorite game types though so I dare not part with it until after she plays it and comes to the same conclusion I have.

The main thing that is supposed to set this apart from all the other deck builders out there is there is a board where a good chunk of the gameplay takes place.  There are still point cards that can be bought on the board in very much the same fashion as Dominion but you also get points by building tracks and stations in cities and remote locations.  Almost anything that gives you points will also give you a waste card that clutters up your deck.  There are several cards that help you get rid of waste and you can always skip a turn to return any number of the waste cards in your hand.  This makes for a pretty balanced system that presents a real cost to generating points.

All in all it is a well designed game but so are the other deck-builders I own and the board didn't really give me a different experience than those.  I simply feel it is superfluous.  Maybe an expansion will give it a different feeling but I doubt I'll still own a copy by then.

OMG, combining deck-building and route-planning: this game was designed for, me if it somehow could integrate tile-laying and it would take me straight to heaven (but yes, that would likely be too  much).
Thematically, trains are not that fascinating to me but the planning and building aspect I love, however I think thematically this game is doing a great job. Most DBs struggle a bit with being thematically consistent, "Trains" goes long ways on that when more building and a bigger system leads to more waste production that one has to take care of at some point and at costs of better turns.
Something else, most DBs play best at 2 or 3 players, this improves with more players because the map gets more crowded and therefor more challenging, play this with 3 or better with 4.

The only reason I have this is to serve as an alternative to Dominion but the question is, do I need both? Probably not. And I prefer "train" games but this is really a deck-building game and Dominion does it well. Not sure what I will decide.

Dominion begat A Few Acres and Mage Knight ....and now 'Trains'.

This is a fantastic Dominion variant. The deck building element is perfectly complemented by building routes and stations, blocking opponents and connecting to remote locations. The choices and payoffs between deck efficiency and building stuff are constant through out the game and the three different game end conditions makes the game feel like there is more than one path to victory than its grand daddy. A US/German Publisher needs to be beating down Japon Brand's door as this could (should) be a smash hit.

Some of the card powers are a direct port from Dominion , thematically though they feel less abstract in this game.

I have some concerns about 1) scalability - its seems better with 3 or 4 than 2 as the board becomes more interesting - with 2 you can just neutralise your opponent which means they have wasted station actions
2) Player order - place track in reverse turn order would make much more sense. 3) With 2 players I suggest the card exhaustion end game condition might be better at a lower number 4) Its possibly too much like Dominion

Otherwise loving it!

Among newer deck building games, Trains is said to be the one that is closest to Dominion. Without having played them all, I do believe that might be true. Sadly, however, the effort to make this game more thematic, also makes each card more forgettable (and in fact it feels even less thematic than Dominion, due to a lack of coherence between what the cards are supposed to represent and their de facto abilities). Thus, the array of available cards becomes more difficult to keep track of (thus the learning curve is steeper). 

Furthermore, the game has an element in it which makes the players have to add "waste" cards to their deck, when doing certain (most) actions. As these cards have no purpose in by themselves, they also seem to slow the game down quite a bit, and they often comes in the way of player's being able to work out good strategies.

In short, Trains feels like a slower and less memorable sibling to Dominion. Personally, I'd play the latter. Any day!

A very addicting game.  Opened the box and played the game 3 times.  Would have played more if I did not have work the next day.  Loved the idea of the card play and the game mechanics (like Dominion on a board).  Lots of game play since there are 30 cards and only 8 cards are eligible(8 standard cards always in play).  Still learning to be more efficient, but love trying to figure out how to win.  Collecting victory points are SUPER IMPORTANT.  Don't dilly dally and all moves should be toward collecting points.

This game is a lot like Dominion.  I mean this game is a LOT like Dominion.  It has the same deck building format and even some of the cards in Trains do /exactly/ the same thing as their Dominion counterpart card.  

The big difference is that Trains has theme.  You are building a railway and also laying tracks and building stations as part of the game.  The building of tracks is another big difference from Dominion as you are interacting with a board.

Good variation on Dominion.  However, we've played with both 2 and 4 players and felt that the board was too big for both sizes (even more so for 2, but we still didn't really bump into each other with 4).  Nevertheless, I like that the game takes the deckbuilding mechanic and does something more with it -- wish more games would follow suit.

RATING: 8
Every deck-building game every made (don't worry - I'm never given to hyperbole) is simply "Dominion with something else", and Trains is no exception.  However, whereas I burned out on Dominion after one or two dozen plays, I loved my first play of Trains.  There are a few reasons for this contrast: I'm much harder to please with strictly card-based games and prefer my games to have a board to move things around on, the theme and presentation were much more polished here than in the cheesiness of Dominion, and perhaps it was simply a matter of having had so much time elapse since my last play of Dominion (and mostly avoiding deck-builders since) and rediscovering the magic I felt when I first played it.  With the card play being so close to that of Dominion, Trains won't win any awards for originality (especially when you factor in the game title!).  But there are a few clever twists, such as with the waste production, and of course the board play is what cranks this one up to 11 (or 8, in my case).  And what really struck me upon first viewing the game was the quality of the physical components, and in particular the visual clarity of the board, cards, and components.  It's rare to see beauty and functionality work so well together!  (I just wish they had included actual train car minis rather than cubes.)  All in all, it's a great game with a ton of replayability (I've barely scratched the surface of all the possibilities with just a single play), and one that I'd be very happy to come back to.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nearly every card in the base game of trains could easily be traced back to a card with identical powers in dominion. The board is an interesting addition to the deck-building genre, but all those waste cards really turn this one into a slog. I like deck-builders so I'm happy to play if someone brings out a copy, but I can't see owning a copy when I already have 15 pounds of Dominion cards.

Interesting take on the deck builder. Not as revolutionary as aFAoS, but still a fun and rewarding experience. Not sure if some of the cards are properly balanced, but other than that, the game has multiple victory paths, is varied according to what cards are in play, and has room for some interaction as well with the spatial element. Would have liked to see some sort of delivery mechanic for scoring VP, but it is fine as is.

Non interactive 2 player game with son which was good and gave the benefit of getting used to how the deck building melds with the track/station laying on the board. Game took over an hour but should quicken with more familiarity and like how 1/2 of the decks will randomise from 1 game to the next. Looking forward to playing with 3+ players.
Tried with 4 players twice now and love it. The family aren't so keen on it but enjoyed this down at the game club with 2 of these being newbs. Much prefer this with 4 players and the game doesn't slow down that much with only 5 cards to be played each time and these drawn at the end of you're go.

"Dominion with a board."

It is quick and has some interesting concepts with waste cards. Wish there was a little bit more complexity to it. Maybe the ability to remove your starting trains would be nice too. Definitely not a bad one, but not something that I feel has a lot of replayability due to the lack of depth.

Dominion with a map and some bonus points to give you direction on the map.

Problem is, the engine used for the building on the map is less elegant as Dominion or Star Realms, and the map building is less interesting as the non-deck part of many other card driven games or deckbuilding games such as Thunderstone. And surely less interesting as economic driven railway games such as Railways of The World.

Biggest downfall of the game is the rapid accumulation of waste, with some cards absolutely necessary (Incinerator, Recycling plant) to effectively cull your deck. In the end, this game suffers from the fact that the random distribution found in decks is fine for a tactical play but not suited for a strategic goal. The fact that on a critical point in the game you can get hosed just by shuffling the wrong cards on top of your deck feels frustrating, and that kills the game.

Nice pastime, would not mind playing again, bit tries to marry two game mechanics not ment for each other.

Played with at least Rising Sun expansion.

Dominion with no buy or action limit. Buy doesn't change much; having free actions does.

Plus, build track and stations--each adds a Waste card--and try to complete routes.

Impression: you need to play big money until can afford VP cards; buy VPs until you clog your deck; then build track/stations for points until the game ends.

Seems much tighter than Dominion.

Similar to Dominion, except that you get a lot of "Trash" cards, trashing works differently and you have a board. It is a challenge to balance board and deck actions - if you build a lot of track, you collect a huge amount of trash and your deck works poorly. If you concentrate onm your deck, you don't make enough VP and cannot block your opponents.

Not that great, and far inferior to Dominion. The board makes it so that you are usually competing with one other person, and the cardplay is just watered down Dominion. A lot of important actions make you take waste (curses) into your hand so you constantly have to deal with that. Unlike in Dominion where curses only come out if certain cards are used, and there are usually plenty of ways to get rid of them. Also, I'm not sure if it was just during my game, but there were no ways to get rid of your starting cards. So if you drew a hand of crappy starting cards and waste, you would usually have a bad turn and card draws became less predictable than in Dominion.

A little more streamlined than Dominion in some respects (no buy or action budget) a little more complex in others (anything to do with building costs)

This is a cute little deckbuilder where players will most often get the majority of their points by connecting to, and upgrading cities across the boards. You can leech off other people's cities, but watch for the increased costs of building into an occupied space.

A big part of the game is managing waste cards (0-value filler, unbuyable) which end up in your hand as a result of building track, expanding stations, or even buying VP cards. 

I like this because of the higher level of interactivity and timing choices over Dominion. The card artwork is a little dark, and slows the game down as little as people peer, so I'd be the first to jump on a re-arted reprint. I think this is currently out of print and unavailable.

I love the idea of having Dominion with a map and the increased feeling of theme in Trains but it shouldn't have been possible to have a strategy that very often is the dominant one that does not involve the board. Then I'd much rather play Dominion with all its expansions. Perhaps removing the 4VP (and even 2VP possibly) buildings can help this. The problem is only exacerbated in a two-player game.

I am so glad that I preordered this game with Japon Brand for pickup at Essen 2012! It was pretty pricey, but with 500 cards it is like buying Dominion with an expansion in terms of variation an an alternative way of scoring points (the board) in one purchase/box. So in fact it offers very good value for money! Trains is very similar to Dominion (it certainly does not offer a unique or original experience), but the board does add some interesting decions, and the fact that a lot of actions add Waste cards to your deck makes it play out significantly different in terms of strategy. Even though it plays better with more, the game plays just fine with two players. Looking forward to my next play.

RATING: 4
Another unapologetic Dominion clone.  Instead of focusing on hand management combos, it's got a board.  At first I wanted to say "if you prefer trains to Dominion's theme, you could pick this up",  but it really does a poor job of conveying the train theme.  The cards are fine, but the board rides a fine line between "not very functional" and "not very pretty".  It looks like someone's not-worked-on-enough prototype.  And the cubes for "tracks" and octagons for stations exacerbates this.

Currently our most played game, and with all expansions added I expect that it will remain our most played game for a while. 
Trains: the base, with essential cards. The maps are too large for 2p. 
Rising Sun: two great 2p maps, a lot of cool cards and route bonus cards. 
Coastal Tides: again two great 2p maps and the cards give the game an interesting twist. Also completes all route bonus cards. 
Map pack #2: California and Italy are the tightest 2p maps. 

All cards and wooden pieces stored in Rising Sun box, all maps and rules in Coastal Tides box, along with 2 printed maps from GenCon 2014: Texas and Saitama.

RATING: 7.5
Pros: deckbuilding integrated with area influence, easy-to-learn mechanics, moderately thematic, variable set-up with card market equally accessed by each player, well-balanced strategies, decent replayability

Cons: limited player interaction, static boards have no variation, limited engine-building, prone to kingmaking

As one of the earliest deckbuilders, this is often criticized as a clone of Dominion and it is indeed impossible not to compare the two. Notably, I have found that many who do not like Dominion do like this game. Those who do not like Dominion often complain about the steep learning curve, the endless, spamming combos that drag on a player's turn, and the hateful nature of some of the attacks. Trains does away with all of these complaints--there are no attack cards, there is no easy way of creating a spamming type of engine, and, strangely enough, if someone didn't want to learn a new card, they could probably get away with it and still do fine. This latter point is possible because "must-buy" cards are notably absent from Trains. Despite all of this, the game may not have the same replayability factor as Dominion due to the static board, and though some may claim otherwise, the board adds a lot to the game. All in all, a great deckbuilder for someone who doesn't like Dominion!

Note that plays listed may include Rising Sun expansion.

Same rating for me as Dominion.  I like the added layer of strategy that the map brings, but Dominion still has more variety.

On it's own merits Trains is a very good game that I am sure will hit the table often for us.  The design is streamlined and easy to comprehend.  The art is great as is the component quality.

Takes the classic Dominion concept in a new direction by providing a 2-dimensional board for scoring. The mechanisms clash with the theme in ways that will keep it from appealing to those who think Dominion lacks theme. It's nice as an expansion to the better Trains: Rising Sun.

Not a fan of the original box art, but the art for the second version is even worse... looks like a big shoe dick streaming in from the horizon.

Half the game is a Dominion clone, the other half feels innovative and most of all, improves on Dominion by adding a lot of new stuff. Basically Dominion is obsolete as this game is several magnitudes better. Extra credit for very fast play-time, about 35 minutes including setup and cleanup. Hopefully we get expansions to keep it alive longer.

By now everyone knows this is a deck-building game with a board.  Everyone may not know that the cards in the game are pretty much a straight-up copy of the cards that are in Dominion ('cause if it works, why mess up the formula?).  But what you might not know is that this game works pretty well given those definitions.  The board creates more interaction than Dominion alone, and the use of the Waste cards creates an interesting dynamic in your deck which doesn't exist in Dominion.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you like Dominion and think this sounds like your kind of game, you're probably right.  It's different enough to justify owning both.

Dominion plus area control (and trash). There are several 2P boards that you can download on here that work great. 

Overall, this game is neat. But, as with so many Dominion-clones - where are the card combos? Just playing your hand is not what makes a deckbuilder exciting. Another problem of this game is that the board does not allow for "alternative strategies" that would not work in Dominion. You would think that quickly establishing a lot of territory should give you an advantage over the old "get the highest money cards first". Not so. 

Still, having the board adds more than you would think. Waiting (very) impatiently for the expansion.

Dominion Railroad.  Essentially takes Dominion mechanics and challenges you to build a rail network with it.  Sure there are some cards like trains and buildings to give you card points but the bulk should come from building stations.  I find the mechanics give meaning to the theme of the game more so than with Dominion.  I like it but you're going to need to like Dominion and trains (60/40) to enjoy this one.  I can see why AEG picked this one up.  I will be a money maker for them with expansion maps and additional card packs.

Instant addiction. What a great, fun, simple game.

But we score cities on the go: makes for a much tenser game, as you can readily see who's in the lead (minus the yellow cards...), instead of adding everything up (and having others ask you the totals...) when you're trying to figure out if you finish the game ASAP.

Some people describe this as a Dominion-killer.   I disagree.  But, it still has it's high points.  You can make some killer combos and cascading runs.  I like the deck clogging mechanism too.  Overall, the deck building with added visual progress on the board allow it to stay in the collection and have occasional play.

After living in Japan for six years and making extensive use of the train system, I absolutely had to have this game. I just wish the US version had kept the kanji characters on the cards and the locations, because that would really help with immersion in the theme. The board is a nice touch, but it does make the game less portable.

In Dominion, you deck-build to get good cards.  In Trains, you deck-build to build a rail network across a map shared with the other players.  I like Dominion, but there's a greater sense of achieving something in Trains and a lot more player interaction.  The other major feature is 'waste' cards, which operate like Dominion's 'Curse' cards but which are a much more regular occurrence in Trains.

RATING: 5
This is a good game, that many have compared to its predecessor, Dominion, and rightly so.

Everyone has the same starting hand, there is a 'market' area of cards one buys to add to their deck throughout the game, (deck-building), and in the end, you are trying to rack-up points.

What makes this game different is the small, game board that is also used. It has a graphic representation of various cities and is covered in hexes which will be used for placing your cubes, (think rail-lines). But to place those cubes to build your rail, you need to play the right cards. Building to certain cities will score more points, and having more stations, (again, via the right cards), will score even more points.

There are abilities on the cards that you will need to manage well to make the most of building your rails. The theme here is railroads, Japanese railroads in particular, with lovely depictions of Japanese rails, stations, workers and landmarks.

The game is good, and is enjoyable, but it really is not so different from 'Dominion' except that the rail-building and the accompanying map helps make the theme come through more than the 'city-building' of Dominion. On that note, Trains has a better 'feel' to it, seeing the rails come along and such, where as in Dominion, you merely imagine the whole thing.

The mechanics are familiar, the theme is interesting, but somehow this game just did not grab me. There was no 'wow' moment while playing and frankly, it was a tad boring. I think perhaps it was not 'crunchy' enough for me to want to spend the time the game requires to finish.

This is a lighter game, but my husband enjoys it enough that I plan on purchasing the expansion, and additional maps.

RATING: 4
A deck-building game with cards that are clearly direct copies from Dominion. There is essentially zero player interaction and players cannot block you from building anywhere on the board. The Waste mechanic from building stations and rails apparently exists solely to make the game longer. If the point of e game is to expand your train empire, I hardly see how that is wasteful. Waste should only collect when you duplicate what someone else already completed. Building rails (excuse me, theme-less cubes) seems like such a pointless added mechanic. I think it's sole purpose is to make you hunk you're not playing a crappy Diminion ripoff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Sure, a designer might strike out from the deckbuilding pack by overfocusing on hand filler (Waste cards) and their removal, but then you're left with something like [i]Trains[/i].

Trash shuffling is a crushing bore, garbage collectors have stinky clothes, and a pigeon stuck in a disposal is a good start on a hot casserole.  If you can't connect those dots, I just can't help you.

The board and cubes do add another dimension to the game, but scientists have known for years that all dimensions beyond the 3rd are wasted without special eyewear.

It is amazing how much the board changes this game. It is also very interesting how different mix of cards changes the dynamic and how important the board is in particular play.

Drawbacks:
- It is so so with two players. 
- There are no recommended sets of cards. This is huge oversight in my opinion. 

Update: I have a feeling that map play is not as important in this game as I would like. I really hope that Rising Sun expansion will fix this (and it does promise that)

RATING: 7
Played two 2-player games.

Like: The rules are very well-written and the game is easy to learn if you are familiar with deckbuilders like Dominion. I was able to teach myself the game in a few minutes just studying the rules after we opened the box. The ability to play and buy as many cards as you like on your turn streamlines the deckbuilding process and allows you to direct your attention to what's happening on the board. The repeated addition of waste cards to each player's deck makes maintaining an efficient deck throughout the game somewhat challenging and interesting. 

Dislike: The basic money and point cards are almost directly lifted from Dominion. The special cards which are chosen for each play have very little effect on the character of the game. They are almost exclusively variants and straightforward improvements on actions you can take with the standard cards. The lack of any limit on the number of cards you can play in a turn removes all of the joy and challenge of building an engine. You only have to fight waste, which is surprisingly easy to do. 

I am unsure why the victory point cards that are available for purchase are worth so many points. It is quite possible (especially in a game with more than 2 players, I imagine) to be competitive while mostly ignoring what is happening on the board and buying VP cards instead. 

The two maps that the game provides are both too large for two players. We had no reason to interact with each other on the board during the game, as we always had valuable space available to expand to and the cost of being "blocked" by another player is very small. With two players, we also found it somewhat difficult to reach the game's ending condition. Trains dragged very slowly toward its conclusion. 

Overall: My 2 plays of this game were enjoyable, but I expect that my enjoyment of the game would deteriorate over future plays. I have no need to own Trains or even to play it again.

Really fun game. Combines deck building and rail game.

Deck builder with many similarities to Dominion; although easier card play as no limit on actions or buys except as limited by what cards you have in hand.

But, what makes it great is the rail laying on a map. Now there are clear concrete goals rather than abstract card combination/action goals. The points are gained by laying rails to certain destinations, building stations, and by buying point cards.

The games are close and tense as you see the players rail lines (and therefore points) unfold.

A good game but Something is missing in this one for me and I cant quiet pin point what it is.

I like the art work on the cards. The board art work, not a fan and the use of cubes for laying tracks is silly.

The deck building part of the game gets very repetative and there really is just not much excitement. 

The added board and placing tracks and stations is ok but can feel boring in a two player game where there is not much competition. It just lacks something.. And ultimately is possibly too simple.. Lay track, build station.. Lay track, build station.

An ok game but not for me, will possibly trade this one off.

Trains is an excellent deckbuilding game. I didn’t like dominion but trains clicked immediately. There are no long chain combo’s like in Dominion but that’s actually a positive thing, because it shortens waiting between turns. Yet there still is an excellent card interaction and synergy. The main addition is the board. It does influence your strategies and is a fantastic addition as it adds player interaction.

A neat iteration on Dominion (many cards are copies), with some flaw: end-game gets a bit snipey and wonkey (perhaps scoring should be hidden as in Dominion), big-money strategy might be boringly powerful, and not enough cards.

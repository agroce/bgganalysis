Played solo many times, I enjoyed it but it usually came down to a single fight, in which everything went downhill for the loser thereafter. Lots of scenarios and great for an amateur historian like me.

I had the version with the tactical map that really only added to play length.

Grognards can lick their lips at this game, with its almost beyond belief detail -populations and recruitment by city/region across 500 years!

It is an amazing game to learn history.  Unfortunately, it is more 'impressive' than fun.  The game was made to be realsitic, and it is, but because of that:

There is the 'big battle' problem.  That is, you maneuver, maneuver, maneuver, and then after 6 hours, you have the 'big fight' and you win the game if you roll a 6 and lose with a '1'.  Unfortunately, this result IS realistic, so it is hard to think of ways to change it.  Having played IR II, I see why Rome: Total War series has players control the battles.  

Having siad that, the combat system overwhelmingly favors the stronger side. The stronger side usually gets kind of a draw or annihilates the weaker side.  Since there is usually retreat before combat, you can't just amass a huge army and overtake the enemy; If you try, your opponent  will retreat behind you, split his forces, and take your denuded areas.  And supply can be hard to maintaiin for large armies.  So the game can be very 'chess-like', as players maneuver for advantage.

Moreover, the 'forced attack or lose morale' rule can get gamey - sometimes, it is bad to have barbarians 'help' you since it gives the other side a free attack on a weak stack.

The interplay between land units and ships is very complex.  Having units on ships and having both the land units help at sea and the sea units help on land gets mind-boggingly complicated (as long as both players can invade). 

Finally - invasions.  again, no easy answer.  They were rare in the real world, but they seem powerful.  Nofi forced the rule that you had to have a good leader to do them, So if you have a 2 strength leader, you invade 10 times as much as the Romans did.  The Romans just didn't really avail themselves of it, but leader like Belisarius made it work; Nofi split the differnece between percieved usefullness and history..

I don't want to dwell on the negatives too much. As a history first game, it could be the best I ever played and it is really unvelievably impressive.  If you want to simualte the effects of logistics and strategy in the Roman world, the game is hard to beat.  As I said above, the key is getting a larger force than your opponent, and trading that off with controlling the regions.  It is one of the games where the better player will win in the majority of games (in the balanced scenarios).  


Fianlly, it is an unbelievable game for learning history.  No matter how much you read on a topic, like one of the Roman Civil Wars, I find I learn a tremendous amount from seeing the cities and their abiltiy to provide wealth and troops, the borders, where troops were placed, the other factions, etc.  You can't help but learn hsitory, and a lot of it, if you play this game with the intensity for which it was designed.

[Bought 2nd hand from Magnus J. FB 2013-09-18]
This game is hard to rate.
It is an impressive work that have been done to create this monster game.
There are 35 different scenarios that cover the entire Roman life span.

Some issues that can be seen is the move-set up-big fight problem. But I guess that this depict the time in some way.
Also the need to fight to not lose morale is also quite gamey as it will make people fight in ways that wasn't done in that time peroid.

But if you like the time era, it's a game to have.
A splendid work on the Roman wars.

RATING: 3
One of the few games about the Roman Empire, therefore I really wanted to like it. I´ve spent many hours and played four scenarios, but this game simply has too many flaws to be enjoyable. The permanent counting of army size to make sure you´re in supply and the terrain values (roads/cultivation), that are not on the map but only on tables and have to be constantly looked up, make this game just a mathematical practice. It´s nearly impossible to force your enemy into a battle, so it becomes a constant maneuvering until eventually both factions feel ready for a clash or are simply too fatigued. Then you do one die roll on a six sider, sometimes after hours of play. If the forces are not more or less equally sized, it´s nearly impossible for the smaller army to win.
Not even the ton of scenarios or the beautiful map can make this an enjoyable experience for me.

I want to play this. I really do. But it never quite makes it onto the table. While this is usually my fault - it seems common for this game. Everyone can appreciate the effort and research that's gone into it. Everyone wants to play it, all of the scenarios - even the really unbalanced ones. But nobody can quite bring themselves to get it out. I wonder if some flashier components would help...?

RATING: 5
Most of the two player scenarios are quite unballanced.  Just swap sides and give it another go.

The game can distill down to one or two critcal dice rolls.  This can be a jar to the ego.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If nothing else, this is packed with a lot of interesting information.  Play, however, is slow.  Most scenarios require a 3rd or even 4th player to play factions that often don't have a chance or have little impact on the situation being played, and there is entirely to much record keeping -- do we really need three different ways to recruit troops?

However, that map is wonderful!

Absolutely loved this game back in the late 80's to early 90's.  Overtime it has lost some of its sheen, including a combat system that it too "do or die" and thus historically inaccurate for the period.  Still for the first real attempt to model strategic-operational decisions from key  periods in Roman history it did a good job, and would make perfect "seed" material for a highly revised sequel.

I'm fond of roman history, particularly since I read Edward Gibbon's History of the decline and and fall of the roman Empire and this game, with its 35 scenarios which deal mainly with the end of the Empire, is priceless. Do you know many games about some wonderful personalities like Julian ("the Apostate" for the Christians), Majorian, Decius ?
Of course, it has some flaws : it is quite long, the CRT is quite good for some scenarios, but fails for some other ones.

RATING: 5
After just getting back into this a little bit I've decided to scrap most of my original comments because I decided that it was heavily tainted by a group of gamers who were simply not interested in the game, and that was over 20 years ago. That's not to say it's great, but it's not that bad, either.

It's a kinda cool, if old school, grand strategic Roman Empire game. Great amounts of excellent historical information. Lots of scenarios, though not all are balanced. Some record keeping required, and there are definitely some rules questions that are mostly handled by the official errata and the FAQ.

The game play itself is a bit dry, and the combat isn't particularly evocative. The supply system, when taken in conjunction with the instant supply check, doesn't really make a heck of a lot of sense at this scale. On top of of all that, the morale track will generally guarantee that most scenarios won't last more than a couple years at most, even though some were historically much longer, which puts a rather big hole in the "great simulation" argument some of the folks here make.

On a side note, the map will be a nightmare for anyone who is green/brown color blind (as one of our players was).

People often complain about the results of combat, as is no effective result or one side annihilated. Also would recommend setting aside large amount of time - and suppressing the tendency to go for a quick result.

I like this game, but as several people have mentioned, the combat tables need to be redesigned to make partial losses possible and not just all or nothing results. I have played it a handfull of times but it always ends up with two huge stacks facing off.

Still, the rules and scenario book are very funny writen with lots of anecdotes. I have set up all scenarios at least once. Well worth the price for this alone.

A game to own and ogle more than actually play, there&#039;s a huge amount of work to do to get the game going.  It may be worth it, but it&#039;s hard to tell.  Needs some tools and charts to help keep things moving smoothly.

First you're going to build your army. You record on a form each unit type (several different types of infantry and cavalry, depending on your nationality or tribe), build 'em, and then make little tick marks because you, and your opponents, can only build so many in each province. And you're also recording each province you have (a lot if you're the emperor) and its tax base and then subtracting unit costs from the total as you build. Now, you're ready to move. Each province has its own movement costs depending on whether it's winter or summer and whether the territory is cultivated or wild, with or without roads. Then, if you're playing the draft updated rules, remember your neatly planned move has been halved. Now you've arrived. Supply! Each unit type has its own stacking points (what it costs to feed it) and each hex can feed so many depending on which of five terrain types it is and whether there are cities or ports (it's great to be near a port). All of this to reenact what is usually a Roman civil war (the national sport) in ancient times; that is, you slowly make your way to each other and fight one climactic battle, winner take all. 
When you pull it out from a closet with hundreds of other games begging for your attention, relearn all this again years later. Fiddly, fiddly, fiddly. It's wonderful history, no doubt about that, but so are most books. Like history, few of the thirty-five scenarios are balanced, but the game lists those that are. I want to like this, but....

A multi-player monster that is worth owning to admire the map and scenario book, as well as being a nice bookcase ornament, but which requires too much space and time to set up and play. However it is possible to cop a quick feel for the game by totting up all of the combat factors of the two largest factions in a scenario and rolling on the CRT to determine the winner.

Strategic level hex and counter Roman Empire game. Each infantry counter represents about 4000 men. Each hex represents 50 miles. There are 33 historical scenarios and 2 what if scenarios spanning the entire 500 years that Rome was an empire. This time span is broken into six periods that affect where roads and cities exist and which provinces are considered civilized or wild. Units obtain supply from a combination of foraging, baggage trains, and proximity to ports. There are no stacking limits, but unless a stack is within four movement points of a friendly port, stacks will be limited by the forage value of the hex it occupies and number of baggage trains, if any, in this stack. Each hex has a forage value determined by terrain, season (summer or winter) and whether the hex is in a wild or civilized province. Although battles can occur between single chits, games often culminate with one huge decisive battle involving unwieldy stacks. Stacking boxes along the side of the map provide some relief from moving huge stacks around the map. Battles are resolved by computing odds ratios, rolling a modified die and looking up the result on the CRT. 
Overall, I like this game. It's not overly complex, but it captures the flavor of Imperial Rome. I like the use of forage values and the way supply affects stacking. Corn rebellions are a nice touch. Some battles are a little too final, especially between huge armies. It's not uncommon for a battle between stacks of 10 or more units on a side (about 50,000 troops on a side) to end with one stack completely eliminated and the other untouched, or for both sides to be annihilated. Also, there's probably a little too much paper work for most tastes. Those power forms take awhile to fill out. Despite all the other excellent Strategic level Roman empire games that have been published since Imperium Romanum II came out, I still enjoy playing it.

The big weaknesses are the supply and morale rules. A unit can move across the desert, and as long as they don't end their move in a desert they'll be OK. The requirement to attack each turn or lose morale I think is also ahistorical and will lead to gamey single-unit attacks to fulfil the rules. If I had the time I'd love to cobble together a rulebook for IR III....:)

I do not play many large scale hex games. I have no place to leave them up. This one is good, but the combat really comes out to being mostly a pile on and see who has the bigger stack.

A game beyond description...epic, grand, all Roman history in one box.  Full of details and information.  When you are playing the game, it looks like taking an effort to study.

Nonetheless, considered the wealth of everything in it, a must-buy for any grognard in the Roman history and for any wargame collector.  After all, a collection without this one is imperfect.

However,  a point people may miss is that Al Nofi has given us a brilliant master piece of a game that has enough infrastructure that allows you create and mold something the way you want it to be. If you like roman era games, this game transcends "a few house rules and it's fixed" mentality  to become "thank you Al for giving us a framework to take this where I want it to go" and become something of a designer yourself.   No other game I own comes close to that.   For a long time I considered this to be the best game I owned.  But you have to absolutely love ancients to appreciate it, almost to the exclusion of any other category.   The kind of game where you read historical accounts to help you modify the scenarios to your suiting.

35 Scenereos, covering from the late republic to Justinian's reconquest. Everything is included from indivual leaders to varying recruitment levels and inflation.
Everybody seems to end up with more house rules in this game than the orginal rule book, so can make finding new opponents difficult.   
I think if you play every scenereo they should give you a degree in acient history.

RATING: 8
Very hard game to rate. If your interested about roman warhistory its worth getting just because of the information on the scenario booklet. Map is a beaty to look at. However its not really "fun" game to play even if you dont mind complex rules and only works well as historical simulation. Never managed to have enough players for the most interesting scenarios.

Definitely a game for bean counters, which I like.  The scope of the game is magnificent, I like the map and the many scenarios.  Some concerns that most games turn out to be one big battle at the end with two massive armies, but hey, it's fun.

A friend of mine owned this game....  We tried to play it several times but I don&#039;t ever remember getting much further than the first turn.  We used to jokingly refer to it as a &#039;real-time&#039; game, because we thought it might take about 500 years to play it!

A blast from the past.  There's a lot to be said for this game which is one of my all-time favorites.  I've played countless hours of it over the years but I'm only going to rate it an 8 because I've 'house ruled' so many things that I've forgotten how the 'real game' is played.  I seem to recall the military aspect was excellent, I've kept that part intact, but the resource management was a little clunky.  This is a very educational game, I learned a lot about the large time period it covers from the game.  I recommend it if you can find it.

RATING: 8
Glossy strategic game of the Roman Empire, huge number of scenarios from Marius/Sulla through to Justinian. 
Main problems are a lack of step reduction resulting in a rather all-or- nothing combat system, and a lack of scenarios from the Republic era. 
Most scenarios are multi-player, with unplayed forces controlled by the "furthest power" rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is staggering in terms of both its breadth and complexity - I'm still speechless. As a game, it is virtually unplayable: more something you admire for the genius and obssession that forged its creation. Indeed, herein lies much of its charm. As a labour of love it is a thing of some beauty.

As a former postgraduate student of Roman history, I am forced to give it a 10 for its bibliography alone.

RATING: 6
I can't imagine playing it again without rewriting the rules. The most interesting scenarios are the ones under the Republic and those about the invasions, but the system is not very well adapted to the latter (for a start, the provinces are no longer right). The three scenarios on the Crisis of the Third Century are nice as well but the history is pure guesswork. I sold my copy in 2005.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a game: not that good. The multi-year scenarios always seemed to get resolved within the first campaigning season in our games. Quite ahistorical results. As a study of the correlation of forces and situations in the myriad roman wars (both civil and foreign) - very well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
We played part of scenario 7: The Crisis of the Second Triumvirate, using the "Advanced rules" V3.4, except that we chose to activate each power one after the other, following scenario order. We were four players.

It was a very interesting play: We were all very satisfied of the experience and would try again!

Of course, you have to check movement and supply and it can be annoying for some, moving those Baggage Trains, but it shows how difficult it was to move a big army, then - especially in wild areas... The player of the Octavian faction even said: "How did Caesar do it?" concerning Gallic Rebels! :-D

PAX ROMANVS!  All or nothing combat results are questioned by some but think about it, it is a game of Ancient Rome where in combat the losers were usually completely massacred.  The Romans also had a tendency to kill their own in which every 10th guy died due to decimation anyways.

RATING: 7
The scholarship in the box alone is worth the price of admission. Between the scenario notes, designers notes and bibliography, there is a plethora of ancient warfare information here. However, the game itself is kind of plodding and definitely an 80's-style wargame. There are files here to bring it more up to date with modern design concepts but I haven't tried them yet. Also, the smaller scenarios are not nearly as plodding and can be finished in a reasonable amount of time. 

If you are a ancients warfare fan, this is a must-buy because the research is impeccable. Simply put, you rarely see games these days with this much historical information. However, for the casual gamer, this will probably be too much of a good thing.

RATING: 5
Massive, massive game with monthly turns and scenarios lasting years, which combined cover a thousand years of Roman History. Few of the scenarios are balanced and only the learning Trajan scenario requires fewer than 3 players. I had too few players and insuficient time. I sold off one copy then later bought another for the scenario set up information for a game I was designing, then sold it off again. So far the only wargame I have bought twice.

Awesome historical simulation. You can find other good games about the roman empire, with a lot more bells and jingles. However, Imperium Romanum II achieve the most historically accurate game simulation using very simple mechanics. There are a lot of scenarios and even the unbalanced ones are usually very funny and always give you a valuable historical flavour.

A Magnum Opus for Nofi. This is an epic game - all of Roman history! Provides quite a bit in insight as Rome transitions from the Republic to the late empire. Works best as a historical simulation and must approached with that mindset. A must for a collector of all things Roman.

However not the most enjoyable or playable game. It is more like a history book. A long history book

Another one of those games we all played in the 1980's where I partially read the rules but never professed to know the lot. Some brilliant historical notes in this game and plenty of campaigns. Good map but pretty poor counters. Why do ancient games ALWAYS use pictures of little spearmen or cavalry on the counter? I'd prefer a NATO symbol if I'm honest!

Despite the bookkeeping and rules problems this is just an awesome game. The amount of historical insight that this game provides is massive. Picking scenarios in chronlogical order from the 30+ available will allow you, among other things, to see the migration of the various tribes, the rise and decline of the Roman army, heavy cavalry starting to dominate the battlefield rather than infantry, even the effects of inflation. If you are interested in Roman warfare or the history of the Roman empire you need this game in your collection.

Imperium Romanum II is a strange game. It's not a very good wargame, but it has simply so much information crammed in. It's also responsible for one of the worst horror stories of my gaming life: A two-hour setup for a multiplayer scenario was followed by a ten-minute game as a Roman player took on a Parthian host and got totally wiped out by unlucky dice rolls.

This game is great to read, terrible to play.  The scenario booklet can be read again and again, but the scenarios are either A) one guy stomps the other or B) two guys fight one evenly-matched battle and the loser's morale plummets and he loses.  So it's either a foregone conclusion or a coinflip.

RATING: 4
- assez fastidieux avec tous les tableaux et cartes auxquels il faut se référer durant la partie
- assez statique du moins dans la partie à laquelle j'ai participé
- on sent que ce sont des règles vieilles de 25 ans, c'est-à-dire qu'elles pourraient être simplifiées et fluidifiées

My second play has only confirmed the flaws I see in the game : the weight and lack of clarity of the rules, the fastidiousness of the gameplay and this for a historical flavour that does not impress me.

Very disappointed in this title as I am a fan of the Roman empire and this game has no real alternative

I'm basing this rating on my experiences with the game some years ago; it's been awhile since I've played it recently, so that number may go up or down. What I recall is that the game played right and felt right, so the willingness to play is based more on my mood -- ancients don't strike my fancy too often. The game is certainly handsome, and backed by some amazing research.

Haven't got by anything better from the period. It's not perfect, it does have very slow system with all logistics calculations, road networks etc. Things that I do understand because of the extented period it tries to cover. However I do find it playable when there are several people who are not obsessed to end game in one night, we may have weeks of break. Diplomatical aspect is more on surface in our games anyways, games rarely end quickly.

Great game on the strategic and operational level. Players need to remember they're not driving tanks and treat their armies as the only thing standing between them and the Empire! Interesting mechanics for the presence of roads and/or cultivation which both affect movement and supplies. 30+ scenarios, so there's a lot of game in the box for many different size groups.

This game is a labour of love from the designer. A history lesson like no other. I treasure the game and would probably buy its update. Already played around 10 games in it. It is a bit slow though and the CRT is very bloody. In essence, battles are very decisive (which is historically not far off). I may probably adjust the rating once I play Pax Romana and compare how the time scales better serve the era between games.

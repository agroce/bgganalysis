RATING: 7
I've never really played any sports games so I have nothing to compare it to, but as far as games in general go: it was fun, quick (after the knockout round, anyway), played well with a large group, was light enough that we could have a conversation while the game was going on, and it worked well with the theme. I think watching soccer is boring, but I really enjoyed this game.

Very thematic. Game time can be a bit long at times, but the experience is well worth it!

RATING: 8
Probably the best sports game out there and good even for non-football fans. The dice can be forgiven for creating great tension and the earlier stages are actually quite strategic in order to get your teams through. Bit too much luck in the final stages but that's sports for you.

RATING: 10
A true modern classic. Crisp design, highly thematic, easy to play and immensely tense and rewarding - the players will be out of their seats by the semi-finals and cheering on their favourite team.

It's not a game about football really, but about playing the tournament structure; and the game distills all the joy and excitement into a simple elegant package.

Nothing special. Has some of the feel of a light Eurogame, but the theme (which alternatively feels like match fixing, betting on games, and league management) and the mechanics (faction influence) don't work together well. The gaudy graphics, especially the random and inconsistent use of color, also don't help.

RATING: 9
Excellent game for the footy enthusiast. Not much skill required and opportunities to stuff all the best teams. It is enormously luck orientated and not a game for those who like to plan everything. I should not like it, but , I love it. Captured the feel of the World Cup with shock results, but, the better teams usually win.

Varias partidas jugadas.

Si te gusta el fútbol y los mundiales puedes echarte unas risas con amigos con este chorrijuego.
Es colorido, divertido y de buenos componentes. Eso sí, el juego es sencillote y totalmente dependiente de la suerte (cartas que robas y tiradas), aunque tiene sus momentos puntuales de emoción y risas.
Da para lo que da. No se debe jugar demasiado frecuentemente a riesgo de que resulte repetitivo. Aún con todo, a mi colección le cubre un nicho para momentos con bastantes amigos no jugones, mi sobrino, etc... 

Eso sí, veo innecesario comprar el resto de expansiones pq con el mundial 2002 de esta caja básica ya tienes todo el juego (a no ser que tengas aspiraciones completistas y quieras tener todos los mundiales y equipos...)

4 Player game with 8 teams a piece is a lot of fun.


Don't play the game with bumps on a log.  The more energenic and involved the players are the better the game.  Soccer FANS ARE fanatic.

You don't have to like soccer to like this one.  

It's a screw your neighbor type game while you do your best to try to save your better teams to advance to the finals!!

Lots of fun here!!

This game's a lot of fun. As there are much footballfans at the old continent, this is a game with very much interaction. Most fun exists when you start playing tiles on other teams. At last this isn't a tactical game, but who cares when you had an enjoyable evening with tons of fun.

RATING: 8
I guess this would be considered another one of my "hidden gems" as you really don't hear anything about this game anymore, and that's a shame. Basically, you play through a World Cup (1930 or 2002) by selecting different countries that each player will control. Countries are ranked in color by how good they were. The game involves playing cards to a match (all 1st round matches happen at the same time, etc.). You can play defense cards, attack cards, goal cards, etc. What's cool is that you have to manage several games with your countries all going on at once. I know this was a small print run from a small publisher, but I really hope this sees the light of day again. It really deserves to be played by more people, it's that good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A really fun game the more players the better but 5 to 7 seems about right for the 2002 game and 3 to 5 for the 1930 version. Lots of skullduggery as you not only try to get your own (best) teams through but sabotage the other favourites in the competition in an attempt to make your own passage to the final easier.

Surprised me - I was expecting something much more football orientated and much less, well, long (just over 2 hours for 2002 and less than an hour for 1930). 

Strangely, it doesn't feel like a gamers game (small hand of cards, simple rules, quite repetitive) and yet it manages to build enormous tension as you head towards the final.

Bags of fun for both gamers and non-gaming football fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A football game that's not about football as such, but allows you to play cards to try to amend the likely results of the world cup tournament, so that the teams you control do better than other players teams. A kinda party game feel to this, it's a good end of night convention game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the rare games with sufficient strategy to keep serious players engaged but enough luck to keep it unpredictable like real soccer. This is one of the only games aside from party games that works well in a massive group of 9 or more players (albeit a bit slow between turns in that circumstance). Hard to find a copy but well worth it.

RATING: 8
The more players the merrier (up to 16 players) although of course there can only be one winner. Runs pretty quickly, is great fun although there is a little bit of book keeping. Each player draws a number of teams, from the qualifying football teams, on a seeded basis so you have minnows and a your share of better teams. Then you try and manage all of your teams to do well but of course favouring your higher seeded teams as they are more likely to go further. At the end you can compare with the actual World Cup outcome - will you change history?? Very clever mechanics.

RATING: 6
Only played twice. Accurately captures the feel of a World Cup tournament, but the random distribution of countries, country rankings and small hand of cards means your chances of winning can be stuffed right from the beginning and outside of your control. Auctioning the teams you get at the start is a bit more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Despite my lack of interest in soccer, I had a lot of fun playing this game. Maybe the fact I owned most of the best teams helped, but I still think I'd enjoy the game even with a fairer team distribution. There are plenty of decisions to make and the theme actually doesn't really matter.

Excellent fun! Clearly, the theme of this game is what makes it rank extra highly for me. The game mechanics are interesting, but way too random and luck-dependent for my usual tastes. However, the fact that this is a World Cup game means that I will be playing it forever. I can play the game with people that don't know or care about soccer, as well as die hard soccer fans, and everyone can have a great time!  The games plays from 3 to 16 people.  This is a winner.

SAbsolutely brilliant game this for all ages and football addicts whether they be gamers or not. The way you can oust the favoured teams through card play should you not have drawn one of the top teams is nice and creates some great World Cup moments. Plenty of excitement and even the World Cup Penalty shoot outs. My favourite game played at the Cast are Dice played with Shaun (The Designer). 50 Plays.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game once you get past the overly wordy rules. The game seeks to emulate the world cup games of 1930 and 2002, and doesn't do it too badly. The 1930 game takes a couple of hours while the 2002 game takes a tad longer. The game works better when played with 3-4 players though it can be played with just 2 but it gets dull quickly.

Edit: I've played it a few more times since my initial review, and this game gets better everytime I play it. I've played the game with football fans and those who don't like the game, and all found it extremely enjoyable. Based on these games I've decided to up my rating of the game.

I haven't tried the expansions yet but am pleased enough with the base game to pick them up.

My preliminary assessment.  Quality of components is very high.  Gameplay is hectic, and where it does not pretend to be a soccer simulation, it should not be judged as one.  It is, instead, a "campaign-style" game, and as such, it succeeds remarkably well.  Easy to learn, easy to understand, tense to play - and I'm not much of a soccer fan.

Like an advanced version of the World Cup game that ADG put out years ago, with non-hidden team assignments.  The gameplay is a little meatier, but on the other hand it takes longer to play and players get eliminated at the end of each round.

The main issue with this game is that the group play is kind of interesting, but as the tournament progresses and the number of teams dwindles, it becomes more and more luck-driven until at the end you realize you just spent 2.5 hours on a total crapshoot.  I give the Group Play phase a 7 and the elimination rounds a 4.  I'm wondering if larger hand sizes in later rounds might ameliorate the problem.

Idea: Play football world cup of chosen year. Each player get team(s) and which streght corresponds to result of years cup.

Mechanism:
Each player has 3 cards that you choose one to play. Played card puts tile on board (Goals, attacks for yourself or defence to opponent). Each team has 2-4 (good teams have more) squares where tiles can be placed. Also good teams can play 2-3 goals cards where weakest can do only 1 goal. Best teams go to semi-finals and then finals. Catches theme very nicely, very luck based but still works well even when your team doesnt win its fun to see the last rounds. Most of gametime is qualifiers thus you dont have to stand out for long.

Didn't like this at all. The entire game seemed dependent on drawing the good cards. The team imbalance seemed unfair.

RATING: 5
If you are a big fan of the sport, then maybe this would be entertaining.  To me the game felt like a multiplayer Balloon Cup.  You have a small hand of cards, so your options are limited, so you either play on your side to help your teams, or on your opponent's side to hurt their teams.  That is about it, but then add in a lot of fiddly stuff.  It's a little hard to track the teams in the overall match, and your decisions just aren't really interesting or exciting.

Here's a fresh idea -- a sports theme expressed through an area-majority game. Players keep tabs on teams spread over several groups (sometimes playing against each other), trying to score just enough goals to win their groups and advance in the tournament. The poster child for this mechanic is of course El Grande, but while World Cup is considerably lighter I vastly prefer it to that (in my opinion) overrated game. Liking neither area-majority mechanics nor soccer (or football, if you insist), I was surprised to find that I quite enjoyed this game. It is fast-moving, easy to learn but deeper than it looks, provides opportunities for screwage and unlikely upsets, generates a good narrative, and is fun to play. My 1930 tournament closely followed historical events, with the major change being the U.S.A. getting through to the final, where Uruguay had to survive two replays of the final match before finally putting away the scrappy American squad (who really did think they'd secured an upset when they played their Goal-3 card in the last match). I do love elimination tournaments and this game provides an excellent overview of the world's greatest elimination event (and this American wonders if the system might be ported to the NFL playoffs or the NCAA basketball tournament). The 2002 tournament is a bit longer but still good with five or more players. Production values are nice, including mounted boards and those wonderfully thick counters that drop easily out of the sheets (the manufacture of which seems to be a secret from American publishers). I wish the box was a bit bigger as it is already snug now that I've added a counter tray. If I buy the expansions I don't know where they will go, but I suppose I must have them. Against all odds this game turned me into a soccer fan. And it has proven to be a sleeper hit with my initially skeptical local game group. Well done.

This is a somewhat heavy game that looks lighter than it is that works just fine for people who don't care about soccer [football] at all.  The rules are simple and easy to understand, but there are a lot of tough choices to make, and a ton of things to keep in mind.  There's more randomness than I'd expect from a longer and heavier game in what cards you draw.  You can mitigate it somewhat by expecting to draw some bad cards, and knowing the right time to play them to get them out of your hand.  At two to three hours, it's not something I'd want to play very often, but I at least didn't want to kill myself.

EDIT August 2010: I couldn't hold off any more. I would never turn down the chance to play this game. The ultimate 10 in that respect.


Flawed in many ways, containing 'king making', 'luck of the draw', 'target the leader', matches decided on dice, oh so many 'frowned upon' mechanisms BUT BUT it perfectly captures the feel of tournament football! Influencing other games as well as your own makes for a bewildering number of decisions, with so much to do but not enough time to do them all (like Through The Desert). Taking England to the semis before cruelly losing out to the Turks brings all the emotions! The game is noisy, plays for adults and children and I know so many people who would, like me, love it! Well done sir!

It's a game of running a sports tournament, not of playing games of football.  Trying to influence your teams to victory whilst playing fouls on opponents makes for a quick enjoyable game and many games come down to the wire.

The fancied teams will generally do well, but it's still great to see Italy/Germany/Argentina go out at the group stages.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an OK game, but there is a lot of luck in it: both in the card drawing, and especially in the penalty shootouts (which are just a more thematic "toss a coin"). This is particularly bad as a large proportion of the quarter-/semi-/finals seem to come down to penalties. There is also a lot of book keeping to be done, especially after the first group stage. One for football-fanatics only, in my opinion.

RATING: 7.7
Certainly more interesting if you like the sport, but I think even non-football fans can get into this one. Just one run through of what each card meant and my friends were up to speed. Everyone really gets into trash talking and messing with each other. ("You beat my best team?!? Well, now I'm going to help a low-ranked team that I don't even control beat yours!") The 1930 World Cup plays pretty swiftly, and is great for 3 to 5 players. The 2002 tournament takes a bit more of a time commitment, and would probably be better with either 5+ players or fewer players with dummy teams. (Controlling 7 or more teams can be overwhelming for most people.)

Gaming simplicity at its finest? It doesn't seem like anything with so few rules could be all that fun, but I'm now seriously considering picking up a copy. 

Allowing players to manipulate the results of everyone's matches is great, and there's just enough decision space to allow for some surprises while on balance still giving realistic results. Recommendation: make sure everyone in the game is adequately fueled with beer. 

Predictably, all the World Cups I'd want to play are littered throughout the multiple expansions!

RATING: 6
Playing with my group, it felt like it was a tweener game. That is, not enough interesting decisions for the serious gamers, and a little too abstract for the casual gamers. And given that there are no really big soccer fans among us, the theme was not right to bridge the gap. 

The gamers kept saying things like, "This is a giant game of Balloon Cup!", "No, no. It's a giant game of Battleline!". I don't really agree with those assessments myself, but I could see their point. This is too pricey of a game for me hold onto if that's what the people I would play with most will think.

A really good "football chart" game which simulates the overall rankings of teams in a more top-level view. Gameplay is simple - place tokens indicating attack, defense or goals on the team of your choice, and hope that its enough to give you the win.

The start of the game was overwhelming since there are so many options to consider, but it rapidly picked up pace. Still this is a pretty long game, but definitely one that is fun to play.

RATING: 6
It's a good bit of fun with the right group of people, but not something I'd consider a great game.  A big problem I have with the game is the element of luck.  I don't have an issue with luck when a game gives a reasonable opportunity to mitigate it, but in this game it is very easy to get saddled with many weak teams and unless the player with many weak teams happens to get really good cards they are essentially guaranteed to lose.  This can even lead to a player being eliminated early which means they sit around while everyone else continues to play.  I'll play again if others want to play it, but its not something I'd ever suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
I own the whole set, and I would enjoy playing all the World Cup competitions in sequential order.  

Thank goodness for the chart included in the last expansion.  This is a fun game, but the rules are diffused over the core game and 5 expansions.  Lots of paper to flip through, for what is essentially a simple game.  The chart helps greatly boiling down most of the details into a great reference.

While I can see how this game might be fun for large groups, I think playing this as a linked series with a core group of four would be a blast.  I devised a scoring system where the players will garner victory points for ushering their top performing team through to victory, or at least a finals appearance.  Points will also be achieved for out oerforming expectations with lower ranked teams.

This is a game that is fun to play, you get to directly interfere with other players.  But at its heart this is an area-majority game, not a sports simulation.  I always enjoy ladder/bracket type systems, and this is the first game I've encountered that lets me explore this familiar system.  I like how the different years actually use the system that the World Cup used for that competition.

Despite my enthusiasm, there are a couple points to criticize.  The boards are a sea of color.  6 different color codes for the level of the teams, and all the flags of the world.  It is a bit hard to process what is going on, but you do adjust.

The boards are oddly organized.  Finding the board you want is sometimes hard to do.

I went with slide storage pages as a flag storage solution.  I did this after a session where we spent 10 minutes just finding the needed flags for the event.

And I already mentioned this, but the rules are spread across many sheets of paper.  The color coding in the rules works, but I dislike this method of calling out the rule differences.

RATING: 7
Fairly straightforward "take that" type of card game where you play cards to advance your team to the next round or play cards to hinder your opponents.  Higher seeds have more opportunities and chances to advance than lower seeds with differing amounts of spaces where chits can be played and differing amounts of opportunities on the dice.  After one play, it would seem imperative that if you don't have a black team, it could be essential to work as a group to make them lose at some point since the dice do favor them substantially.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's great fun, with even those less interested in football getting something out of it. It is a very good balance between footy sim and light Eurogame. If you like both then this will probably appeal.The components and board are excellent quality and give the game a polished professional feel.The tournaments are biased towards the historically successful teams, so it feels realistic with the right kind of patterns for scores. My only minor quibble is that the final four games (semis, final 3rd place playoff) can get a bit out of control goalwise. You will probably need to set aside the whole of a 2-3 hour game session and I think it will play best with 6-8 players (but is still fun with less).

A crazy sort of fun, that may or may not get crazier with more players. The board is super confusing, but that is eventually overcome.

Update: Played 10-15 times and this is still a great game!

Playing time for us: 6 players: 1.5-2 hrs.

Wow, this is a great game! I have played the 1958 finals twice, one 3-player and one 5-player. In the first game I got four green teams and one white team, and I took Paraguay (green) to the silver medals! In the second game I got blue-green-yellow-white and took USSR (blue) and Argentina (green) to the quarter finals. USSR lost to Sweden on the flip of a coin!
There is a lot of random factors, the simulation is not perfect, but what a great game! Tense, fun, tactical, thematic, nice to look at, simple rules. New players should be advised to focus on their best teams and not try to cover everything.

RATING: 5.5
Very very long for such a light game. Some national flags are very similar which makes it very difficult to figure out which player is doing what to which team. Sheer number of options (can play your 3 cards on  any  country) available on each turn increases downtime more than it ought to -- those two factors combined (confusing flags and can play anywhere) probably add 1 hour to the game. Outside of that, the game is quite fun and recreates the atmosphere of the world cup well -- cheering for different countries, the reaction when a penalty/offside is called, etc. Not a huge fan of the elimination aspect of the game, with more than 5-6 players I could see this being a big problem. Would love to play this with 2 or 3 players only.  Note to publisher : for the next edition, think about printing the country's name next to its flag on the board (just like the country flag chits), this could shave major playtime from the game.

The Uruguay tournament is a disappointingly short (although perfect for three or four players who don't have long), but the Japan/Korea tournament is excellent.

As a "game" it would rate somewhat badly.  Unless you play with more than 8 players, there is no reason to want to affect other matches (that you're not involved in) when you're too busy concentrating on the ones you ARE involved in.   This would be less of an issue when playing with perhaps 10-16 players, but how often does that happen.

This game is fun, however, from an "experiment" perspective.  If you don't focus on the winning aspect too much and just appreciate the flow of the tournament, even if you've been eliminated, then you'll probably really enjoy this game as I did.

RATING: 8
Good soccer games are tough to find, and this is the best one I have encountered to date. It is more of a tournament simulation than soccer game, but it does it well with a good dose of soccer theme.

I tend to play with no more than 4 people, and a thirty two team tournament all at once is a little much to keep track of in a smaller group. I tweak the rules such that we only play a single group at a time and make sure each player has one team in the group. Much more manageable this way, and yet each group is a mini-problem to be solved in itself. By focusing on one group you can give more attention to doing the mental math as each game is progressing.

Even if you get a crummy team, you can still have fun just trying to get that team out of its group, even if you don't win the tournament. There are a surprising number of strategic options. Do I play a weak tile on my own team to protect my last goal? Do I try to fill up my opponent's opportunities with the crummy tile? Should I play a goal on another team to ensure a team I am close in results to gets a loss? 

The round of 16 is great fun, even with only two players. The semi finals and final are actually not very interesting unfortunately. The mechanic of reducing each game to 3 or four action cards for each team breaks down when both players are focused on just that one game. It works very well when players have different games they are valuing highly.

I don't like the way the dice are used. The designer skewed the game so that the teams that actually went far in the historical tournaments have the highest probability of going far in the game, but this is a mistake in my opinion. In some cases, one of the teams in the final was not one of the pre-tournament favorites. Why not skew the odds in the favor of the original pre-tournament betting odds? 

The real problem is that the dice mechanic abstracts what could be imagined is going on. If a lone attack tile becomes a goal if that team's color is rolled on the dice, we might imagine the attack tile is a clear-cut-chance on goal. The goalie could make a great save. The striker could cooly finish his chance, or he could lose his composure and blast it over. What will happen? A good team still has a higher probability of finishing this chance if you rolled a die for each attack tile.

Instead, a good team could score a goal even if they didn't have an attack tile in play?!? Instead, if I have two attack tiles in play in a game, I get an extra goal. It's all very odd. I play with a house rule to change this aspect of the game.

In comparison to the card game, the board game looks much nicer, with a wallchart style board and tokens to place for goals etc. But I didn’t feel it offered a huge amount more in the gameplay department and it suffers the same downsides as the card game too. In the board game you play all the group matches simultaneously, which gives some tactical opportunities, but isn’t quite as fun as the blind bidding of the card game. And as with the card game, the tension seems to sadly dry up a bit in the latter stages of the tournament, with the final usually just coming down to who drew the better run of cards. I have had a lot of fun with both though, football fans and non-fans alike seem to enjoy it and it doesn’t drag despite it’s surprisingly long play time.

The idea is great. There is the option to play a shorter or longer version. The rules are very clever, adequate and clear. This game needs a better "short World Cup". 1930 is too far from ideal.Update: Expansion set #1 addresses this problem. Great!

Rating went up with the expansion. It could fall short from a 10 because I would like to have seen a better quality board in the expansion and a way to balance the teams each player receives (like Wembley that rewards weaker teams that a have a good run but don't win the whole thing). A must have to anybody who has ever followed a World Cup. Best beer and pretzels game. Accomodates a great range of players scaling extremely well.

Whenever I introduce newbies, I have to warn them that this game is *not* about playing soccer and it's *not* really even about playing the World Cup.  It's much more abstract than that.  It's more like managing a bunch of marbles that are going into a funnel, so that your marbles squirt through and everyone else's marbles get stuck.

That said, I enjoy this game very much.  The mechanics are actually fairly dry, but we create oodles of theme by spouting a play-by-play and trash talk everytime a card is played.  Placing a "defense" chit by itself is dry, but "Oh my, France is stuck in its own backfield!  There's no chance that they're going to score anytime soon!  What a bunch of losers!" really creates excitement.

A great game. Totally based on the luck of the draw but that's not the point. The point is rewriting history and making your favorite team the world champion of 2002 (or 1930). Players create the atmosphere by for example shouting out: Costa Rica scores two goals against Germany! A greate idea is to give advantage to the teams that did well in the actual games. The surprises feel so much better when you are really at disadvantage.

A játék tökéletesen visszaadta azt a gyerekkori saját kis világomat, amikor egyedűl lévén újrajátszottam dobokockával az összes világbajnokságot. Talán 7 éves lehettem amikor nagyapám könyvei között találtam egy pédányt a világbajnokságokról. Benne volt az összes eredmény, érdekességek. Oda-vissza kiolvastam vagy tízszer, talán ekkor hatalmasodott ki bennem a statisztikák iránti rajongásom. Ebben a játékban minden játékos menedzselhet csapatokat és megpróbálja eljuttatni őket a csúcsra. Nagyon ötletesen le van szimúlálva a csapatok akkori erőviszonya, tehát sokkal nagyobb siker egy kis csapatot a győzelemre vinni mint a favoritok közül bármelyiket. A csapat minden tagja élvezte a játékot, rögtön négy partit le is játszottunk.

This is a hard game to rate. As a strategy game up against (say) a Puerto Rico or something, it would probably be a '3' or so. In terms of fun and excitement it's got to be at least a 9. Good fun - and with the right bunch of people it can really shine. It's really cool that ANY World Cup in history can be played. (So naturally I bought the 1966 expansion!) Personally I fell out of love with football many years ago - the so called beautiful game has become very ugly indeed, riven with corruption off field and full of diving cheating players on it. The board game is much better!

RATING: 5
Fun, but only with the right crowd: World Cup lovers who love filling out and following the tournament charts, love upsets, chaos and "what-ifs", and will sacrifice perfect analysis for the sake of having fun and keeping the pace moving, just like real soccer. The game is barely anything when boiled down to mechanisms, a sort of multiplayer Schotten Totten with randomness, but the theme and excitement make the game.

2+3

Me encanta el futbol y eso puede ser una de las razones por las que me encanta el juego.
No le pongo mas puntuación, porque creo que hay demasiado azar... pero bueno... bien pensado, el futbol es así.
Edito: Le bajo algo la nota, porque tal vez, sea demasiado simplón y ademas no vé mesa. A mi, me sigue gustando.

Ordered directly from the developer at Games of the World UK. Shaun is a very friendly man who responds promptly to emails and takes great care to ship his games securely. The World Cup Game is absolutely beautiful. Gorgeous hard-mounted gameboards, big chunky pieces, large dice - you cannot help but feel that you got your money's worth and a whole lot more.

Fantastic game, see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/296474]my Expansion 2 review[/url]

1930: Argentina over Romania (2:1, extra time)
2002: Sweden over Germany (2:2, 5:4 pks)

[2 plays] This is themed as a World Cup Soccer ladder tournament. Every player has individual interests in seeing their assigned countries succeed in the stepladder tournament. The mechanics are pretty straightforward, and it is basically an elaborate multiplayer game of chicken where you are trying to assign goals to your teams while screwing up the scoring opportunities of the other teams. More to it than I summarized there, but quite uncomplicated and much more tactical than strategic.

I enjoyed this ok and will definitely join in again since it plays pretty quickly and soccer fandom is not critical in any regard.

Most recent play a big 7 player tournament 6-5-10 with Brian P, Donovan, Joel, Corey, John, and Michael.

A corking, easy to play, and very well themed footy game.

Beautifully designed and combines the mechanics/skill of a strategy game and the luck of a card game. With countries seeded as per the performance in the real tournaments, the game provides a faithful representation of each world cup. However with a bit of skill and luck, it is possible for an outsider to progress and even win.

As each player controls multiple teams, there should always be continued interest in the game till at least the 1st knock out stage. Even if you are unlucky enough not to progress, the downtime once the knockout stages are reached is no more than 20 minutes or so.

I have played each of the tournaments with 4, 5, 6 and 8 players, the game works well. I have even tried a solo game playing with 6 hands, and this works as well!   

2015 UPDATE: Still my no.1 game, although most lays are still solo... but who cares, it's great fun.

Very, very similar to the World Cup card game. I don't like the gameplay mechanics. It is tough to turn a sport into a board game.  I think my great love of soccer hinders my enjoyment of this game.

I played a 16 team tournament with five players and had a fun time.  It probably works best to have some type of initial draft, but it's fun no matter what and has too much luck to take too seriously.  Reminds me of Formel fun with the card driven mechanics and when you lose a team you have more cards to distribute to each remaining country.

RATING: N/A
This is a fun game for those who like football. I like football so, it's a fun game to me. It has loads of luck involved specially because there's no way a player can make his teams win if he doesn't have any important goal cards but still is a good cute game. Only played a three player game in the 1930 World Cup Tournament and looking forward to try the game with more players in a more complex tournament. 

Beer game definitely.

Needed for GamesNight 8/4/08- will be used to try and hook some non gaming football fanatics. Taken along to two gaming groups and it has been looked upon in horror. First play - like it a lot. Mrs Sorp threatened divorce if i try and inflict it upon her again. This may be one for  boys only.

What a great game! I love football (please don't call it soccer) and this plays really well. Also a very good family game, whether you like footy or not. Easy to learn, easy to teach and fun to play - the three basic ingredients that mean a good family game.

Edit 1/15 - I've also played this a couple of times with my group, and we really enjoy this for larger numbers of us - plays well with around the 7/8 mark. I've upped my rating from a 7 to an 8 because of the element of knowing when to use your good cards, and when to hold on to them.

Samurai the footie game (kind of). Campaign-level approach to the football World Cup where each player "owns" many teams. Taking each round of the competition in turn, players commit postive (goal, penalty, defence) or negative (foul, offside, defence) influence/action tokens against any team in any match, but your available actions are limited by a hand-size of 3. When all actions are completed, round matches are scored, tables calculated, qualifiers determined and the next round started. Teams are seeded based on actual 1930/2002 results, so in a particular match strong teams might get 4 actions, while minnows only get 2 actions. Player elimination in final stages might be an issue for some. Great quality components.

My one playing felt very thematic.  We cheered and jeered as goals were scored in different games and at the penalty calls and shots.  Pretty fun.  Lots of chaos. 2006/11/18

I like football as much as anyone else that was born in Brazil and likes football. That means something. The game works, but I found it to long and with a huge downtime. And, with player elimination, the game [u]starts[/u] more fun than in its end - that can't be good.

I prefer by a country mile the card game.

I have yet to play this game.  However, I'm a huge soccer(football) fan and anticipate I will really enjoy this one.  I have already gone through the rules.  

Update:  I've now played this game and absolutely love it.  Some really tense decisions that added to the enjoyment of the game.  More strategic than it first appears.

Funny "party" game were football is an excuse to screw and get screwed by taking decisions (adding goals, signaling penalties, tighten defenses, etc) on any game scheduled of a specific World Cup tournament. The least knowledge on football is not necessary at all. Easy to explain and play. A really underrated piece.

Thematically quite thin, as it's really just an area control game where the 'areas' represent soccer matches. I'm a bit turned off by the uneven team allocation - it seems very difficult to win without a top team. Choices are interesting, though, and it can be fun to try to get your team to the finish.

I watched this one at Essen 06 and think it's one of the best multi-player World Cup games out there even topping ADG's World Cup Tournament by a notch or two.  This one focuses on specific WC's rather than a generic overlay of team quality.  The teams are rated on how they stood in that specific cup match.  Excellent quality as well but a bit pricey.  Expansions 1 & 2 are now out also for other cup years including the recent 2006 WC in Germany.  At heart this is a card/hand management game with a bit of luck thrown in at the end of each round.  Good strategic play will reward your teams with a place in the finals rounds. UPDATE: Expansion 3 is now out as well.  A must have.  Another edit, we're up to expansion five that completes everything up to this year's WC in S. Africa.  Still a top notch game from the card management aspect level.

The game sunk its hook in my lip and is dragging me all over the 7 seas.  Don't get the fishing metaphor?  I love this game.  Very enjoyable for 2 to at least 8 players, adults and kids alike.  See my review:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/301470

Excellent game design. It is about the whole tournament and changing history. It is much more like a multi-player card driven wargame. Lots of luck involved but still fun while you are in the tournament. There is elimination but the end of the game comes quick after the quarter finals.

Learned the game at Essen '07 & had to have it.  Great design, wonderful playability, and tailored to each world cup, historically.  This last fact makes the game superior to ADG's World Cup Soccer game which is a really good game as well, but not as good as this one.

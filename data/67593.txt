I haven’t played The Pillars of the Earth boardgame so I can’t compare that with this cardgame, yet I found this filler pretty good, although just a bit too simple: I’ve noticed how the usually more careful or tactically aware players tend to be completely helpless when playing this game, since it only requires you to play a card without too much thinking.

More control than it seems. Note that throwing negative or zero cards into others' tricks can be just as effective as throwing good cards into your trick. I really like that there is more than just points carrying over from hand to hand. That in itself, makes this fairly unique among trick taking games.

I love trick taking games and this little card game is a solid addition to my collection. Rules are pretty simple and there's quite a lot of luck involved in the game play. But one can also keep track of the cards which makes it a bit more interesting for the players. All in all there's nothing really unique in the game.

The Pillars of the Earth card game is a very good trick taking game.  The theme fits well, and the results of the tricks taken give you resources and craftsmen to turn the resources into points.  Great game.  I would suggest choosing how many rounds to play up front to control the length of the game.  Get this one if you can.

Pretty neat trick taking game.   Super Euchre.   My only knock is that it might work better if an ability card is never returned to the deck in the case of it being discarded with the King's trick.  That could prolong the game too much, but it needs more plays to know for sure.

SOLD IT!

Probably less than average trick taking game buttressed up with an interesting twist of resource generating. Will likely turn many off since each round other players can have more control over what tricks you win than you do. This game is for the devout Pillars of Earth collector or gamers looking for another trick taking high.

A trick-taking game that incoporates some very interesting ideas. You basically score points like in the boardgame, by using your craftsmen to convert resources into VPs. To do so you need resources and craftsmen, of course, so you need to win tricks that include resource cards and craftsmen of your colour. What makes this a lot trickier than it sounds is that the highest card wins the trick not necessarily for the player who played it but for the player who "owns" it (i.e. who is representing that colour). That means you can win tricks for other players and other players can win tricks for you, depending on the cards you have been dealt.

That, however, is also the big issue. While the idea is neat and I'm sure there is a good game somewhere in there, you are very much at the mercy of the cards here. If you don't get any of your own cards you have pretty much no influence on which tricks you'll get (if any). If you only get low-valued cards you can't even try to win bad tricks for your opponents. I'd like to award an extra point for cleverness but the game is just too chaotic as it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game.

Each round you know which cards are in play (except one), you also know which resources you have and which ones will hit the table.

You need to know and plan which cards you want to get and which cards you can affort to loose. Problem is, you don't know which opponent has which of your cards.

It's a crazy trick-taking game! You can play ANY card in ANY moment! This freedom is too much for some but I find it intriguing and refreshing. Not a great game but a very solid filler.

And the graphics on the cards are georgeus (except for Aliena). Play it and find out if you can manage to win in this game of twisted rules ;-)

An astonishingly thematic trick-taking game from the author of Pillars of the Earth. The twist here is that each player owns a color and gets the trick when the highest card is of his color – even when somebody else played this card. The cards of the players' colors represent workers similar to those in PoE. To be able to use them you need these workers in your tricks. Each one of them is worth 1 VP. Additionally, resources need to be gathered or the workers can’t generate further VP’s. Resources are neutral cards. The third type of cards is person cards, e.g Tom Builder, Bishop Valeran. These usually give a special skill or cost VP’s.
The game is a pleasant and relatively uncomplicated affair but it's not up to the competition of better trick-taking games available and ultimately the gameplay is too chaotic for my taste or at least my play is too bad to influence anything.

Ok so at points in this game you don't have a lot of control but on the other hand it doesn't seem to be that often that you can't do something to either help yourself or hinder the other players. I like that because of the way that the scoring works you have quite different decisions to make than (probably) all the other trick tacking games that I have played.

This was definitely a interesting one. It's a bit hard to grasp the rules at first, then it's quite complicated to find out how to play well. I'd rather play other games where this is apparent immediately (or at least quicker).

Also the theme is non-existant.

First impression (3 players): The basic idea is okay and similar to board game. You try to win resources and workers (of your color) from tricks. Resources can be turned into points after round but after that you can only keep 3 resources for the next round. 

The specialty of this trick-taking game is the way how every player has a set of his workers cards (values 2,4,6,8,10) that win the trick to that player if his card wins the trick no matter who played it. There are neutral cards too that will win the trick to player who played it. I like this idea but in reality it doesn't seem to work all that well, you seem to lack control because of player-colored cards. I have to play again to see if this is really a problem of the game or my thinking. 

Actually with 3 players this game might still be playable because in general you have at least a little control but with 4 players you can easily have round where you basically can only choose who will get the tricks as you have no control over your own game...

March 2017: Down from 8 to 5.

I don't care for trick taking games where it's better to play last. Too chaotic and tactical for my tastes.

You win this game less by your own skill and more by what other players do. Most of the time, you are trying to fuck players over by playing their "resource-to-point converter" cards to tricks they can't win.

The game stays in the collection as it is still quite unique.

Nov 2012: This is one bizarre trick taking game.

The twist in this game is that each player is assigned a suit. If the highest card played to a trick belongs to your suit, you win it regardless of who played the card.

This game does not force players to follow suit, nor is there a bidding round. Consequently, players can't deduce very well what their opponents are holding in their hands nor manipulate how their opponents play their cards.

However, because of that twist of players being able to win tricks by a card played by an opponent, the game forces players to anticipate which cards will be played. For example, if I'm not holding the highest card of my assigned suit, I have to be careful about playing cards that deduct points because my opponent can force me to win that card.

That said, the game feels more luck driven than other trick taking games. There's not much you can do with a bad hand -- there are no ways to adapt to it such as different objectives or variable partnerships. Also, because the game is only five deals, it might be too short to balance the luck factor.

It is a lot of fun playing this game, though. What makes this interesting is that the cards have a variety of actions and special powers.

Wow. Brought it to the table after years. Years! And we didn't play the whole game even, but having a trick taking veteran with me was a great idea. The session showed me how this game actually plays. 

It's all about chaos and dickery. The game shouldn't be taken really seriously, but more of a chaotic ride. The only weird thing about it is theme and visuals. Uhm... doesn't fit the gameplay quite. 

The premise is - suits don't matter for gameplay at all, but if a certain colour wins the trick goes to the owner of the card, not the one who played it. Meaning the game is all about getting rid of crappy cards and try to get some good stuff home. The scoring is a sort of puzzle - you need to win materials and workers and combine them into points. 

Might need a visual redesing.

One total newbie game behind. The English translation of the rules is not perfect, with a little bit of German skills we were able to make out (hopefully) all the details. It took couple of rounds to for all of us to understand the game and how the points are generated and which kind of cards there are. Fairly enjoyable after all.

The game itself is a trick-taking game, where you try to gather two kinds of cards: resource cards and worker cards, which convert resources to points. Couple of special cards are added to the mix with some special powers and the winner of the trick is not selected in the simplest way. After couple of hands it gets clearer, so not much of an issue.

Second game now under my belt, three players with two newbies. It took again a while to understand the game, but once you get it, it feels ok.

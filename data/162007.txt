Played with 5 which was fun, but with a lot of downtime.

This is a game I saw set up at Dice Tower Con but never had time to demo. I picked up a copy on eBay later that year with the exclusive Kickstarter dice (how could I not after seeing the demo?).

This has quickly become one of my favorite games. I love simultaneous play and this scales really well between 2-8 and only takes about an hour.

4 plays / 4,6,7 players

LIKE: Building your crazy machine and having the parts fly off at the end is hilarious and rewarding. The dice placement mechanism is great, because the dice both help and hinder, and create interesting choices of where to place them. Plenty of catch-up mechanisms. Plays quick.

DISLIKE: Takes up an enormous amount of table space. Knowing how to arrange dice and keeping track of what people get from them is fiddly and easy to miss something. Also, it is difficult to see the border colors on the cards to keep them organized in piles (minor). Although the game plays quickly, there is downtime when waiting for other players.

OVERALL: A good game for certain groups. I think the game could wear itself out after a few plays, but if they made expansions it would really push it further. Impressive for a kickstarter game.

RATING: 7
The game mechanics are fun and interesting, but it's held back by the requirement for simultaneous turns, since that means you can't pay attention to how other people have built their machines, nor do the other players notice your own insane invention. If you instead decide to play turns out in order, then it takes way too long, and you spend several minutes staring at your own setup while someone else painstakingly works through the details of their own turn.

I do think 2-player with synchronous turns would be very fun, but that's really limiting.

Chaotic, random, but fun and funny.  Some of the attack cards are fairly mean-spirited, and it's highly dependent on what you draft and when (since you play as you draft, you can't store things up and decide later where to put them).

I love this theme, probably the most original idea I have seen out there. I love the art and the components and so does my husband. I really like the game but I don't love it because it almost feels like a multiplayer solitarie, once the players have to do actions at the same time to speed up the game, you barely see what others are doing on their own machines. That was the game's biggest flaw to me, but I still like the theme enough to want to play it, maybe not as often as I thought I would, but if the husband likes it, I will definitely keep bringing it to our table.

Great game, picks the best of games like 7 Wonders, Among the Star and other drafting games and put a very solid dice rolling and placing mechanism that adds a lot to the theme and feeling of the game.

RATING: 6.5
Beautiful art; but the division of spaces on the race tracks is a little unclear at times, and the damage icons can be hard to spot.

A good game, and not anywhere near as much luck as some people claim. It has two MAJOR problems which prevent me from rating it higher, though:

1) It has now become the fiddliest game I have ever played!

2) The fiddliness forces players to focus on their own contraptions, which results in Steampunk Rally being multi-player solitaire; but the game can't really be played well unless you are focussed on the other players! 

Thus, Steampunk could use some heavy streamlining. In all seriousness, if Mr. Bishop were to do this, I think a fantastic game would emerge, since there is great potential under all the fiddliness. Here's hoping a second edition will appear!

I seem to have a minority opinion here. I like drafting games, but I didn't feel like I was able to make very many meaningful decisions in this one. It's a convoluted mish mash and entirely too random. I think this appeals to people that enjoy the theme and rolling dice; I'm not one of those people.

RATING: 6.5
To steampunk rally είναι ένα ιδιαίτερο racing game όπου οι παίκτες κατασκευάζουν το όχημα τους καθώς τρέχουν. Αυτό γίνεται με μια απλή διαδικασία draft τεσσάρων καρτών στην αρχή κάθε γύρου. Τις κάρτες που επιλέγεις μπορείς είτε να τις τοποθετήσεις στο όχημα σου είτε να τις κάνεις discard για έξτρα ζάρια και γρανάζια. 

Στην επόμενη φάση όλοι ρίχνουμε τα ζάρια μας και τα τοποθετούμε πάνω στα διαφορα εξαρτήματα του οχήματος για να τα ενεργοποιήσουμε. Έτσι κερδίζουμε movement point για το όχημα, έξτρα ζάρια, γρανάζια ή/και ασπίδες για να προφυλαχθούμε από τους κινδύνους στη πίστα αλλά και από τους άλλους παίκτες. :p

Γενικά όσο μεγαλύτερο το ζάρι τόσο περίσσοτερα resources θα μας δώσει όμως τα μεγάλα ζάρια θέλουν και μεγάλο repair ώστε να μπορέσουμε να ξαναχρησιμοποιήσουμε το εξάρτημα. Εδώ είναι που μας βοηθούν τα γρανάζια. Επίσης να αναφέρω πως κατά την διάρκεια του draft υπάρχουν και action cards όλων των ειδών. Προσοχή ειδικά σε αυτές με τις οποίες επιτίθεσαι σε όχημα αντιπάλου. Αν κάποιο όχημα φάει πολλές ζημιές θα αρχίσει να χάνει κομμάτια. :devil:

Το παιχνίδι περιλαμβάνει tiles διπλής όψης για να φτιάξετε ότι διαδρομή θέλετε. Επίσης υπάρχουν μπόλικοι επιστήμονες για να διαλέξετε, ο καθένας με το δικό του αρχικό όχημα. Γενικά από replayability δείχνει να πάει καλά ενώ και το artwork το βρήκα ωραίο και πολύχρωμο. Κανένα παράπονο για τα components. Έχει άπειρα ζάρια να έχεις να ρίχνεις. To theme του παιχνιδιού το νιώθεις και στην πράξη.

Προσοχή δεν κερδίζει όποιος περάσει πρώτος την finish line. Αντιθέτως όταν αυτό συμβεί, σημαίνει πως ο επόμενος γύρος θα έιναι ο τελευταίος και νικητής θα είναι όποιος πάει πιο μακρυά από την finish line. Οπότε προσέξτε πότε θα παίξετε τα ρέστα σας. :p
     
To draft, το engine building και το dice placement είναι από τους αγαπημένους μου μηχανισμούς οπότε είναι λογικό να μου αρέσει το παιχνίδι. Όμως είναι κάπως solitaire για τα γούστα μου, καθώς μόνο οι take that κάρτες προσθέτουν κάποιο interaction και δυστυχώς προσθέτουν interaction του είδους που δεν μου αρέσει (targeted attacks). Παρόλα αυτά θα το ξανάπαιζα αν είχα την ευκαιρία.

Love the artwork and the idea but the game fell completely flat for us. Player interaction, outside of the few "take that" cards, is limited to denying cards to another player during the drafting phase. Incredibly light game that either needs more depth or more interaction to make it interesting. As it is, I really don't care what other players are doing since I can only affect my own contraption and performance. Simultaneous player actions mean missing out on what others are doing which is the only semi-interesting point of the game, but taking turns makes the down time brutal. Really wanted to like this one more.

Really cool racing game with wonderful components, but the real joy is the mechanics BEHIND the race, as you choose one of these historical inventor personages and then build up your machine through card drafting. Dice placement is wonderful, and I particularly like the 'venting' mechanic which allows you to reset your machine parts for further boosts. 16 characters in the box, two sided tiles for two map tracks which really fit the theme. Roxley is 2 for 2, and even though I like Super Motherload a little more, some extra map tiles and cards in the future will probably ensure its longevity too.

It is a very nice mechanic, although I think a bit more limitations were needed and also the overwhelming kickstarter content actually hurt the game.

probably broken characters.

RATING: 7
Very torn on this. I really enjoyed building a huge engine and enjoyed all the dice manipulation, BUT then the game features some incredibly random game defining event cards that will just WRECK you if your opponent(s) drafts them. A very very strange design choice, which is too bad given that the game itself was really really good stuff. Will play again knowing the possible disasters, but based on my one game I will say that the game would definitely be better by removing a few OP cards.

If there is one thing that is worse than player elimation, then it is de facto player elimination, where the player who is de facto eliminated is forced to continue playing until the game is over. That is what happened to me in my one play, although fortunately the game was over quickly after my de facto elimination.

A fun racing game with one particular drawback in my eyes. The drafting is fun, the racing is fun, and the finish line is... meaningless. There's an additional round after someone crosses the finish line. If you get passed during that round, you lose despite having finished the race first.

Some argue it's a strategic benefit. I think it would have been better to say "if your invention is destroyed crossing the finish line, it doesn't count".

Either way, this is easy enough to house rule and the core gameplay is pretty fun. I'll continue playing it and I'll probably suggest it from time to time.

Not the best game. One of the players pointed out that the card drafting each round didn't really enhance the game and maybe made the construction a little too random. 

I think it might have been better served by finding some other way to distribute cards.

I wasn't as bothered by the 'take that' cards as other players were, but don't play this with people who don't like games with conflict. 

P.S. Someone needs to learn the meaning of the word "unique" or play a few more games! 

[q="Game's More Information section"][b]Unique Gameplay Elements - (Written by Gavan Brown)[/b]

• 8 player Support
• Simultaneous Resolution during the racing phase allows for a huge amount of gameplay to be packed into one hour.
• Simultaneous Resolution allows the game to scale to any player count without significant increase in play time.
• Boost cards are hidden information and allow for huge comebacks, removing the feeling of hopelessness traditionally felt in racing boardgames.[/q]

Are any of these really unique?

-----------------------
Interesting racing game with a card drafting engine that runs it.  There were aspects I liked a lot, but there were others that bugged me a lot.  The game for the most part is very solitaire, and the game also feels like it is 1 turn too long.  This really could of been Mario Kart: The Boardgame :P

After one play:  Engaging, lots of things to consider, but with a great flow. Simultaneous play saves a LOT of time, but even still with a lot of players this will probably take some time. Our first game with six players took probably about 90 minutes. If we play again soon we could probably shave a lot of time off of that, though.

I'm not a fan of the boost cards. They add some much-needed variability to the game, but they create timing issues and when multiple people want to play them it just feels clumsy and the game grinds to a halt. But I see why they're there, they're just not my cup of tea.

Very cool game, I like it a lot and there's nothing quite like it that I've seen.

A recommendation for a possible second edition: Make the pawn pieces shaped to the outline of the characters. When they're all rectangles with a thin coloured border and a dark illustration, we often had to pick up the pawns to get a good look as to whose it was. Add more of the player colour to the illustration, and make the cardboard cut-outs different shapes. That'd be a minor but welcome improvement.

The actual strategy seemed light, and if you got this game down to say 35 minutes it would seem like the right amount of time spent for the 'gameplay meat'.  And if you played with a group of veterans, you could likely do it. Definitely would play again.

Edit 9/30/17: Second play, definitely not a 7. This game is ok but I'm not in a rush to play again. Bumping to a 6.

I've played this one several times now.  It's a good game, but we always find ourselves having to go back to the rule book for something (which is not well organized).  Not sure if I just don't play it often enough or what, but it really slows the game down having to search for rules as often as we do.

Kickstarter edition
with Blast Pipe errata cards

The only thing I regret is not getting the Tesla-Edition.

Let's keep a chronological timeline here:

The Kickstarter was the best I've ever been in. Questions? Nothing was unanswered. Problems? Nothing was unsolved. Excellent communication. Totally transparent.
I will have a look at every new game Roxley will sell.

And the best of all: WE GOT A PONY!!!

Components:
I have the Kickstarter-Edition so my opinion might not be representative, but the metal cogs are awesome!
While the campaign I was pretty unsure about the translucent dice. I don't care if I can look through my dice, normally I like solid ones better...so I was kind of sad that Roxley had them as a high level stretchgoal although there were many different possibilities. I would have died for another track.
So, now I have them... OMG these look astonishing. How could I ever doubt that. Well, ok, let's keep it a bit less fanboy-ish: Maybe I like them so much because of the colors. Roxley used colors that are different. Not your standard red, yellow, blue, they used interesting nuances instead.

The rest of the components is standard high-quality, nothing to mention but also nothing to complain about.

The gameplay itself feels fresh, like nothing before.
Of course there are race-games and dice-placement-games and drafting-games and so on, but this not nearly similar to anything I've played. Even my girlfriend (not a fan of race-games besides the occasionally Formula D), who was sceptical about the game, loved it.
There are so many possibilities and chances. You suffer from your bad rolls normally? No problem here. High numbers give you more effects, yeah, but smaller numbers are cheaper to clean of the board. Well balanced Mr. Bishop!

There is so much more I could say about this game, but I have to get back to the table again for another round or two or fifty.

Another Canadian Game.  Hopefully it works out better than Top This.  So far communication and updates on Kickstarter have been great.  Lots of extras and upgrades like clear dice and metal gears.
Received missing some stands but other then that it is excellent.  Card quality a little worse then I had wanted - they are a bit sticky when new.  But once sleeved they are fine.
Gameplay is fun, there is little disadvantage to a large machine, one or two cards really punish a big machine.
Plays fast, I like the drafting with two, it would be more frustrating with four.
Four is better but you have to play it with people who play quickly or it can drag.  After a few 15+ minute turns it gets annoying for other people who are done already.
Errata has helped reduce super long turns.  Still an AP game.

The game is initially fiddly, with lots of moving parts. I suspect after a few plays that will smooth out and the game will flow better. There are several interesting game mechanics with the card draft, simultaneous build and move phases, and the constantly-shifting inventions. This one is a lot of fun.

Bumped up the rating. After the first couple of plays, the mechanics really start to flow & the game becomes fast-paced for smaller groups. The theme and game mechanics have an excellent synergy

I'm very impressed with this game so far: the game play is polished and the production quality is great. I would probably suggest bigger tiles as the board is pretty small if you are going to play with higher numbers of players.

There are lot of options available to you throughout the game, the variety in Inventors is great and the crazy machines you build are very entertaining so I'd say the theme comes through pretty well. It's a bit like Wacky Races but with historical figures which makes it even cooler tbh. I'm not usually into steampunk but here it works very well.

I am excited to play this game more and am likely to increase my rating with further plays.

I've mostly played this game as a 4-player and it is a blast to put together your machine and race across either the Swiss Alps or the Hoverdome. The artwork is great and it's fun to manage your invention with dice and cogs. However, a lot of AP can slow down the game a little with newer players and I'm finding that people don't want to lose parts, so it either doesn't happen or happens to the point that players lose everything but their cockpit. No happy medium. Overall, fun family game!

[b]Kickstarter - Christmas 2015[/b]
Very fun, dice driven, racing game.  I love the inventions that are built.  If you take too much damage, you lose parts to your invention.  The idea is to optimize your invention to move you the furthest, while still repairing damage.  Cards are drafted each round.  Each dice used takes up a spot on your invention, but you make "vent" the dice by lowering their pips by spending cogs.  Otherwise, you may purposefully damage your invention just to rid your invention of clogged parts.  I thoroughly enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Virtually no player interaction outside the card draft, simultaneously played for the most part, a bit of math aka division, over and over, you divide a given number into the dice you play, round down. It doesn't suffer from hidden dice roll like Roll for the Galaxy.

Still, the parts quality is high,  the art work good within the theme, the price not the absurd MSRP that two companies/distributes are known for, set just right. It's a enjoyable game, lots of dice in 3 colors, a draft card, dice engine builder, with a self generated reduction to that engine  as you race along, if you don't plan ahead.

If you like Roll for the Galaxy, you will like this. It's worth getting. I just wished more player interaction, not in a major hard hitting way, but like what is found in the card drafting. 

The Castle of Burgundy is the better game of the two for a dice game, but that is a high bar.

I think Steampunk Rally is at its core is a beer and pretzel game with all the dice rolling, with a bit of brain burner moments now and then, because it's a race game, win or lose it's a pleasant experience, except  for the math.

Light, fun dice-chucking and (literal) engine-building / destruction. Likely best if nobody thinks super-hard during drafting or racing.

Most of the time, the Race phase seems nice + fast, but once or twice an invention has allowed for some ridiculously long combo-chains that dragged on for a while.

RATING: 8.2
What is really ingenious in this game (pun intended) is trying to extract the maximum efficiency of a "crazy" machine each player invents in each game. It is really enjoyable when it´s possible to use one or more energy units (steam, fire and electricity) not only to move, but also to activate parts of the engine that produce shields, cogs, etc.
Also very nice is the ideia of the "vent" phase, that is, the need to free used slots in the machine to reuse them.
Furthermore, this game is, after all, a race game where the theme is very present - when the shield is low, it´s very curious to see a machine lose parts when hitting the rocks, if the options of flying or drilling through them is not available, for instance.
The powers and upgrades avaliable through the draft seem a bit unbalance or unfair, which deslike me a bit, however, i recognize they input a certain degree of randomness to the game and are necessary.
This a very good and fun game to play that still requires some thought but it´s probably not playable by more than 5, since the chaos and AP would be tremendous.

Played twice now, really enjoy this Wacky-Races game. Though it probably does bring out the AP in me (so perhaps other people don't enjoy it quite as much when I'm playing).

Card drafting, engine building, dice placement, all good stuff.

RATING: 9
Great game play and good mechanics from other well known liked games (racing, card drafting, dice placement).  Takes some of my favorite elements from 7th Wonders and Eutopia and adds a great steampunk inventor race to the framework. Really liked it after one play.  The metal cogs are awesome, the dice fantastic.  Too bad there aren't glow in the dark radioactive dice for those reactors (expansion hint hint). Would suggest Monopoly style pewter tokens for the inventors for the final sprinkle on the cake. 
Glad I "invested" in this one.  Great job.

Kickstarter 6 pack expected around August 2015, arrived 22nd of September after being held in customs for 2 weeks.
Very well imagined and very beautiful, but not so well designed racing game where you take a role of a crazy historic inventor and build your steampunk machine with which you are trying to reach the end of a dangerous track. It requires some house rules considering free rearrangement of machine parts and player interraction and it might be more fun. With more plays it also becomes faster and more racey.

There is a lot to love with this one. A myriad of inventors, various track possibilities, and loads of unique invention parts keep the game ever changing and consistently enjoyable. I like how some cards scale with player count, too; becoming more or less powerful as players are added to the fray. Dice luck is easily mitigated and low and high rolls are equally desirable; a critical factor in any dice game. The simultaneous action makes the game feel surprisingly solitaire-like despite its ability accommodate more players than a majority of similar titles. The best part is that you literally build engines to "engine build". I love hunting for feedback loops and creating lengthy conversion chains to speed past my opponents. Its difficult to piece together an engine and maintain it (due to the damage mechanism), but this forces adaptive play. Certainly my favorite card drafting, and engine building game.

When I heard this was a game that resolved the "racing" element of the game simultaneously, I was skeptical (i've played a lot of Formula D and Jamaica and couldn't wrap my head around how a racing game would do that).  But this game does it and it is extremely fun.  Building the ships up always looks amazing several turns in, component quality is good and I like that there are a bunch of options for male and female characters that are all a little different for starting condition.  I like that each character comes with a little history about them as well.

RATING: 9
This is an awesome gateway game that can be setup and taught very quickly.  The game is very well balanced and offers a great combination of problem solving and some luck.  In this game there is no such thing as a bad roll.  Often low rolls are just as useful as high rolls and ‘cogs’ can be exchanged to reroll dice or increase the value of a die.  

The game employs a really cool ‘die’ engine that can create some really spectacular chains.  The card drafting mechanic ensures that every player will always be able to progress in the game each round.  

Each round in the game is played simultaneously so there is little down time.  You can, however, get some AP if players build large complex machines.  This game is well designed with some good replayability.  

I liked the game enough that I sleeved all the cards only after playing a few games.  The Ultra-Pro Standard American "Yellow" (56 x 87mm) fit the cards perfectly with almost no border (and are only about 1mm longer than card).

I heard this described as mario Kart the board game, and that intrigued me.

Galaxy trucker-esque kart building combined with a drafting phase is really interesting. 

You can keep the drafted card and increase the size and engine of your machine, or you can 'sell' the card for gears/dice. You use gears to manipulate die rolls and/or remove them from your machine once you have placed them, and you need the dice as fuel to (hopefully) propel your cart forward. First across the line wins.

There is an interesting element to the building of your carts and this is a little multiplayer solitaire however there are also boost cards which form part of the draft that have more of an overall affect upon yourself and your opponents, either causeing them damage, changing the conditions of certain parts of the track, or propelling you further forward.

I like the 'vent' phase in particular whereby you have to remove the spent die from the previous round, or leave them clogging up slots in your machine. This prevents a single good combo of cards causing you to win the game as you must balance expanding your machine with spending cogs and clearing out the old dice.

I enjoyed the play of this so much that I immediately went and purchased a copy for myself

New to both my wife and me, and my wife almost immediately declared this one of her favorite games (top five, I think). The game is a bit of a bear to learn, and learning with 6 other people wasn't much fun. Our teacher did his best, but he'd only played once before, so it was fairly rough. With such a difficult entry point to the game, you know it would have to be good to get a second play, and it IS good.

The drafting is straightforward, and the linking of cards into your contraption is not much more complicated either. Actions cards are usually straightforward too, which leaves dice and movement. And herein we find the intrigue!

Acquiring dice, rolling dice, assigning dice, adjusting dice, recovering dice (sometimes over several turns), and throwing away machine parts as your rumble through the mountains - it all came together in a wonderfully kooky theme that we enjoyed immensely. We borrowed the game and played it 2p the next day, and enjoyed it just as much. Good stuff.

Surprisingly fun. Thematic (to a point), moves fast but is mostly a multiplayer solitaire. Which is all right, it's a game about building and tearing down your own creation rather than competing against others. Some fun mechanisms, such as it being advantageous to take damage in certain situations. Lots of ability interactions make for high replayability, but a pretty steep learning curve and can be rather random.

Hatalmas meglepetés volt. Egy gyenge közepes játékra számítottam, de a végére megbántam, hogy nem szálltam be a KS-be. Elég szoliter a játék a kártyadraftolási részt leszámítva, de annyira leköti az embert a saját hajójának az építése, a kombók összerakása, hogy ez egyáltalán nem zavart elsőre. A kivitelezés nagyon szép, és végig magával ragad a játék hangulata és a sok-sok lehetőség. A kockadobálás se visz irreális szerencsefaktort a játékba, mert aránylag olcsón lehet variálni rajtuk. Csak arra kell figyelni, hogy amikor nagyon fontos a jó dobás, akkor legyen elég fogaskerekünk. Nem szoktam elsőre 8-asnál nagyobbat adni, most se fogok, de benne van a potenciál, majd a következő játékok során kiderül.

Played once 2 player and once 6 player. Worked well both ways. 6 player was a little intense the first few rounds trying to keep everyone on track. I'ts not an overly complex game, but it's also hard to explain until people just take a few rounds themselves. The second game with the same group should be much smoother. I really enjoy how the game works and find it different from anything else in my collection, in a good way.

Played 3 times now, from 2 player to 6 player, enjoyed more each time. Really digging this game.

I played this game when a friend brought his copy that he got from kickstarter. I was blown away by this game, it is so much fun. It has a bunch of things I enjoy in games, card drafting, building, racing and a few screw you cards. That all combined with the beautiful steampunk art and the historic figures you are playing, plus you can play up to 8 players and it works well, this game is a definite must have.

Quite pleasant this Steampunk Rally is. Very random and is very close to the party-game, but it is fun to build ludicrous machines and accelerating them in the hope of reaching the finish line before disintegration ;) Only the draft is a little dull, because it is single round there is no way to optimize. Should bie 8-card draft instead of 4-card draft.

A superb dice-placement, drafting, race game that simply oozes (or should that be bellows?) theme. 

It's a lot of fun building your outlandish machine and fortifying it for the perils ahead. Some 'booster' cards even enable you to interact directly with other players on the track, Wacky Races style.

Highly recommended!

Feels like work. Not fun to use cards.  Feels clunky and underdeveloped.  No good monetary reason to have the opaque and ugly dice for the retail version even though I understand KS exclusives can be important.

Neat game. I like the art style, the card layouts and the theme. It's pretty clever having to vent your machine to free up usage spaces and dice collecting/rolling is always fun. The track itself needs a bit more variety and there isn't a whole lot of interaction amongst players. It can turn out to be quite a solitaire experience besides a card here or there. It seems difficult to learn initially, but really the overall gameplay is quite simple; just do NOT teach this to 6+ people at once! Especially with simultaneous play. Chaos!

A race game with card drafting, engine building and dice allocation. It has interesting ideas and the mix of mechanics works, but the game arc seems a little off. In the late game, it's usually more efficient to discard drafted cards to gain dice than adding them to your invention. And assuming everyone has a decent engine, ultimately the game comes down to roll-and-move: roll high and you get more movement points. Although I enjoyed playing it, I thought it was a bit too fiddly for a family game and a bit too random for a gamer's game.

„Tudom, hogy gőzgép, de mi hajtja?”
A világ vezető feltalálói, agyai összegyűltek, hogy a természet energiáit megzabolázva csodálatos masináikkal versenyezzenek egyet.
A játékban a 7 Csodában már megismert kártya „draftolással” a játékosok lapokra tehetnek szert, amelyeket típustól függően többféleképpen felhasználhatnak. Tovább tudják gépeiket építeni/fejleszteni, alkatrészekre tehetnek szert, egyszeri képességeket aktiválhatnak a fordulók során a győzelem érdekében. A gépük felépítésétől függően szereznek meg kockákat (erőforrásokat), majd a dobás eredményét felhasználva lépnek előre a táblán, szereznek további erőforrásokat. Menet közben vagy karbantartják a gépük elemeit, vagy hagyják leszakadni, hiszen majd lesz újabb lap, amit beépíthetnek. A pálya kialakítása is változatossá teszi a játékmenetet, lehetőség van rövidíteni, taktikázni.
Összességében kialakításában minőségi, játékmenetében átlag feletti gémet ismerhettem meg. Jó érzés látni, ahogy gépünk épül és egyre jobban tudjuk kombinálni a lehetőségeinket, majd egy-egy megtartott lappal meglepni versenytársainkat. A draftolás része több játékosnál meghosszabbítja a játékmenetet. A szabályok, játék megtanulása gyors, egyszerű, de a lapok kiismeréséhez azért szükséges pár játék. Mindemellett bár magyar fordítása létezik, inkább azok részére ajánlott, akik értik az angol nyelvet (a kinyomtatott fordítás lapozgatása is időbe telik). A lapok erőssége, hasznossága különböző, tapasztalt kezekben jobban hasít a játék, repül/mozog a masina, ezt kéretik tudomásul venni.

Can play up to 8 people (!!) but is best teaching a smaller group (3-5 players) as it takes a while to understand how the iconography of parts works. The rules are all players do the actions in a phase simultaneously, but when learning it is a good idea to go one player at a time.

Still it is exhilerating fun; you want to acquire dice, roll high numbers for some machine parts, low for others, (and other times it doesn't matter). The game play feels like the box art haha.

Steampunk Rally has some unique mechanics, but it suffers from being a game that can't decide if it wants to be lightweight or provide more complex tactics or strategy. The core idea of constantly morphing machines, managing the loss of parts and tactically drafting new ones, is quite enjoyable and provides multiple paths to victory. The randomness of dice rolls to power the machines is frustrating and can undermine most plans. Opposing mechanics like these (as well as a fairly low amount of interaction considering the theme) don't completely sink the game, but it does prevent it from going down as one of my favorites.

I almost won* by letting my machine fall apart every turn and rise like a phoenix from the ashes.  I don't know if that's a bug or a feature.  

This game is kind of like what would happen if Mario Kart and Troyes conceived an illegitimate child while Generic Space Guy #72 from Among the Stars watched.

You draft cards to attach to your racing invention, or discard for action dice. You place dice on pieces of your hodgepodge of an invention as it races along some S curves.  You can take some shortcuts but with extra damage to your invention. You can armor up to absorb the damage, or elect to remove parts of your invention. You're supposed to slow down and vent off your old dice so you can place new ones on, and progressively make a bigger thing.  But I just said, "screw it," and launched my used up parts like Stage 1 of a rocket.  The resource that allows you to vent dice can also be used to bump up the pips on your dice, so I used those to just go faster.

*2nd out of 6.  I would have won if I didn't get hit by this game's equivalent of a blue shell.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2015)

I hate racing games so I didn’t want to play Steampunk Rally, however many of my friends did so we let chance decide, sadly I lost and we played the game. I can say it is better than I expected.

Steampunk Rally mixes a traditional racing game with a drafting mechanism. It also adds another layer of complexity because each player has to build/improve his machine over the length of the game. I found this mechanism to be novel and I (kind of) enjoyed it. The rules are very easy to grasp and the gameplay is fun at first but can get boring and repetitive soon, that is, the game feels a lot longer than I would have wished for such a simple game. The decisions come mainly from the draft itself, but they aren’t very hard, sometimes you won’t draw or get what you need (even with the draft) so I feel the game has a healthy dose of uncontrollable luck. This situation is aggravated because I feel some of the cards are really powerful (the game has balance issues) and it is pure luck if you get one of them or not. There is also luck with the dice rolling, but here I feel you have some tools to mitigate the luck, so this part bothers me a bit less (but rolling high is much more advantageous). To summarize, I feel the game has too much uncontrollable luck.

I enjoyed the dice allocation mechanism, after the drafting it offers some interesting (albeit in it majority obvious) decisions.

It is very easy for someone to cheat (intentionally or unintentionally) in the game.

The art of the game is very good as are the game´s components. 

The theme is VERY boring for me, I heavily dislike racing games and the steampunk setting doesn’t do anything to alleviate this.

Bottom line, it was a better game than I expected, but still, I won’t ever request a play of Steampunk Rally. It has too much luck and it is way too simple for a game of such duration. I wish it was a lot shorter because it gets old and repetitive very quickly.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 8.25
Based on 3 plays. 

The game is great fun. The theme is dripping as you put together a steampunk invention, power that steampunk invention, and decompress/vent the invention after it has been powered so that it may be powered again.  I am ordinarily not a fan of race games but this one really shines - it is a clever drafting/ tableau building game brilliantly overlayed on a steampunk racing theme. 

The way machine parts interact and can be activated by or mitigated by dice is brilliant - the give and take between the difficulty in "venting" a high (but powerful) dice roll versus the ease of venting a low (but often less powerful) dice roll is genius.

The game presents difficult and interesting choices: for example do you build a large invention that can handle the terrain and generate the power it needs, do you build a machine with expendable parts so that when you take damage you will simply plan on rebuilding, do you take boost cards which provide a one time benefit to you (and perhaps a detriment to others) a dominant part of your strategy? 

Could be potential balance issues: 1) Thomas Edison won all 3 games and is the only inventor that lets you get two dice. 2) Smooth motion is very powerful and highly sought after(because you ignore ALL negative terrain effects) but it is not always available to every player- even if they are trying to incorporate it into their strategy. Also some of the boost cards can be downright nasty.

Fun race game not unlike the vibe I get in Roll for the Galaxy because it's a lot of heads-down on your own board.  There is some interaction which is great.

RATING: 6
I think this is one of my favorite drafting games since you actually do stuff with the cards you draft instead of just placing them in front of you. The (admittedly small) puzzle of how to best run your invention during the race phase is fun, and it's very satisfying to pull off a lot of movement and still find a way to not have your contraption fall to pieces!

The player interaction is definitely low, but that's not an issue for me (for this game at least). In fact, I almost see this as a positive. If it's the end of a game night and we start a game of Steampunk Rally, it doesn't really matter is someone has to leave the game early for some reason.

Too complex to be an easy game and too easy to be a complex game. The interactivity between players is very low, unless players are immersed in an adequate atmosphere.

In any case, the best are the components and the artwork, preceded by a perfect crowdfunding campaign.

玩家在每回合的輪抽階段選擇組裝飛行器或是拿取動力能源，另外齒輪也是不可或缺的零件，當組裝好供應牌器的系統後，就可以大力的向前飛行，然而地形的阻擾依然會造成飛行器的損傷，玩家有時不得不斷尾以求生存~
當然對於輪抽遊戲來說，起始抽到的零件牌組顯得格外重要，起始牌運是這個遊戲的可變因子，這場遊戲大家都各自組裝各自的飛行器，以至於沒注意到其他玩家的發展，造就了某玩家能量運作近乎無線迴圈的巨大機械，我想這個遊戲應該不能只是自顧自的發展，多少觀察對手再給牌才能避免產生無限循環的巨大怪物~~

This was an interesting little game. A mish-mash of drafting, racing and Galaxy Trucker. Players build an engine/machine for racing that slowly breaks apart during the race. In terms of gameplay, its definitely very interesting. Lots of little options, plus minor AP while considering how best to combine parts.

The biggest negative for me is the tacked-on racing bit. The game does not move quickly; drafting takes time and you never really get a sense of urgency or speed. Instead the machines seem to be moving along a VP track.

Overall, enjoyable, but slightly fiddly game. Takes lots of space if you are building a large machine.

This game didn't do it for me. I really like racing games, and I really like dice management games, but this just felt too bogged down. It's not super complex, but it's more complex than I'd want a game of this genre to be. Some interesting ideas, but I just couldn't get into it.

2015-10-04 - 7.5 - That is my first Kickstarter game and I'm not disappointed with it. It's a race game with neat dice placement mechanic. There is not too much interaction and most of the time everyone is playing on their own. But the gameplay is fun, the inventions are not as difficult to move as I thought they will be and it is not as overwhelming as you might think after getting know the rules. I really like the artwork of this game.

2015-12-27 - 7.5->7 - Building your invention is really fun, but everyone does it on his own. And sometimes simultaneous play causes confusion during playing boost cards especially. Still, it's pretty fun game.

2016-02-12 - 7->6 - After rethinking - there is too much solitaire there for me and in racing game it shouldn't be like that IMO. I can play it, but I will likely get rid of it. Building your dice engine is really cool though.

Saddle up, strap in, and get ready to haul ass to the finish line without blowing up your contraption! Pick a famous inventor with a special bonus akin to your liking. Draft components to build onto your machine or sell for money. Roll dice to "activate" your components, try to remove all those pent up dice on your racer or just throw out the components all together!  Very few "gotcha" cards, gameplay is simultaneous so the game plays quickly and fluidly. Light-Medium game, teaching shouldn't take more than 15 min to explain rules. After two rounds everything should be pretty clear. Roxley made a pretty solid game here.

A wacky dice-utilisation game, this had quick turns and low downtime.

Jo LOVES this game. I think it's OK. I think it's easy to get screwed over with a bad initial draft. And I feel some there are some major imbalances in the characters. But mostly the idea of inventors breaking and completely rebuilding their machines with different parts throughout a race is just weird.

RATING: 7
Played once and came in dead last, but managed to cross the finish line (where I promptly exploded).  I tried to focus on one resource, but that provided too little flexibility and ultimately caused me to fail in the drafting portion of the game.  Didn't matter.  I still enjoyed myself.  Would need a few (or maybe many) more plays before grasping all of the options.

Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.

Wow, a game that seems to be an example of a mechanism first design but with a theme that fits perfectly. So it's an engine-building race game - so of course it has a steampunk theme! Your dice are kind of halfway between workers and resources (steam, fire, electricity) and during game you keep constructing (and tearing down) your engine. Once again it seems worker placementish mechanism fits fine with racing on a map (see Lewis & Clark, only this is more streamlined even though once again it does feature a mix of mechanisms including drafting as well). Just like many engine builders, it has the problem of long downtimes during last turns (even with simultaneous action selection it can last very long to combine everything for some) but luckily by the time it starts to get out of control the game ends. It's an exciting, good one.

After a video review: I like the way you design your machine and use your dice. It could be reusable for many other games where you can customize machines like Mecha, space ships, etc.

But this game is very illogical, I don't see how you could continue to build up your machine while racing. I think "build first and then race" would have made more sense.

Second, damage is very unforgiving. It blow up machine parts to a point where I am not sure if you can still move when you only have the cockpit left. I have nothing against losing parts, it just feels like you have to rebuild your machine from scratch all the time.

So in the end, good ideas, but poor implementation for the racing aspect of the game. The machine building aspect looks fine.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Fun, fairly lightweight, race game involving drafting, constructing a machine, acquiring and using dice on those different components to accomplish different effects, as well as a bit of take that in some of the boost cards. The appearance is pretty sweet as well and the kickstarter bonus metal gears are an eye-catcher. I think we had about 10 people stop by the table and pick one up to check em out. Should play fairly quickly once one is familiar with the game. First round might be a bit slow, but it helps everyone understand how to play and it picks up after that.

This is a fun game!  There is a ton of strategies on what pieces to add to your machine (or destroy on your machine), what dice to take, how many cogs to take.  There are a ton of different investors to start with in the Kickstarter version.  The replay value on this game is very high.  We played a three player game.  Five would add more choas.  I can't imagine playing with more than five though.  Dice would become scarce and there might be too much going on at the same time.  Theoretically all players go at the same time.  I can see playing this solo also.

Watched an interview with the developer to hear about this game. First game I played that had drafting as a major part of the game. 

Throwing your machine together on the fly and making do with what you can pick up in the draft does the theme justice. Have only played it with a max of 3 players but I'm interested to see if it really stays at a similar play time with 6-8 people due to the simultaneous play.

Excellent initial impressions here, and I'm not even usually attracted to the steampunk theme. The gameplay is quick and it's really exciting to see your invention come together. I love how the machine gives back to itself once you build it to a decent size - very satisfying. It has a little bit of an Among the Stars feel in that way. It's smart dice placement here and you have to think ahead a few steps to make the most of each round. The artwork is super and the mini bios of each inventor inside the rulebook is a nice touch. And I love translucent dice! This is the kind of game I would use to show friends that the world of 'real' boardgames is truly awesome.

Take one part card draft, one part Galaxy Trucker building, and one part Troyes dice conversion play style, and you get Steampunk Rally. 

It's a crazy mash-up and works really well. Others have said it doesn't feel like a race, but to me it does. It's not the turn-by-turn tension of being neck and neck but rather the stress of sometimes being the tortoise trying to make a desperate attempt to get ahead of the hare.

The game play can be fairly heavy and thinky, while the machine building is just plain fun. The fact that you can rearrange your machine at any time, or even dump cards at any time allows for amazing flexibility.

I'm not sure what the higher player counts will be like, or if I'm brave enough, but honestly it seems like it wouldn't add as much time as it might chaos, and even then I suspect it would still be fun.

RATING: 9
One of my favorites. It plays up to 8 (and does so wothout issue), and is easy-ish to learn without being shallow, making it a good game for most groups.

Although the game is very dice-heavy, almost all the random chance can be mitigated with good play, and this just helps to reinforce the steampunk asthetic. A poorly desinged vehicle will sometimes just not work right, while a well designed one can just keep going pretty consistently.

The draft system works by giving each player one card from each of the four draw piles. For every crippling issue a player might have, one of the decks is virtually guaranteed to have a solution. You still have to adapt to your draw, but you're never screwed over by it.

I could go on, but my opinion can be summerized as such: >it gud

Really enjoyed this!  Probably one of the most appropriately categorized "engine building" games I've played. :)  A bit lucky, but for it's length, and what the game is meant to be, it's great.

The theme (actual inventors and innovators placed in a fictional "steampunk" universe) is fun, and unique mechanics for each character were well-thought-through.  Theme and art are just wonderful.  I love how the machine components fit together and make hilarious vehicles.

Sounds like there are perpetual asset generation loops that need to be fixed with errata - but that's ok.  It's rare and fixable, just as it was in Caverna. 

This is DEFINITELY my favorite game where Marie Curie is part android.

RATING: 7
"Engine"-building game in which you draft parts of a crazy racing machine and use dice in 3 different colors to power your invention. Downside is that dice usage can get quite complicated (use blue to gain 2 red dice, make 2 steps with the red 5 on the rocket boosters, use a yellow die to remove a red die, then activate your character ability, ...) and thus each player plays for themselves. Interaction via event cards can also be quite take-that in nature.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like most things about this game: the drafting is interesting, there is no down time but still enough player interaction due to the draft, and the dice placement and engine building are very enjoyable.  However, it suffers from two clunky elements. First, the venting stage is just plain inelegant.  Dice stay on your machine until you can pay for them to get cleared off, but sometimes it gets hard to keep track of what was left on your machine from last turn and what you just played.  Also, the game is not easy to teach because the phases and the order of the phases are a mix of very thematic, intuitive steps (passing around and choosing what parts to add to your machine), to arbitrary things with a thin theme that need to be there to make the game work (bumps, the random dice pool, cogs and their various uses).  All of these elements are fun, but just hard to learn and explain.

Bought at Cardhaus Black Friday Sale.

I love building engines, and Steampunk Rally does that exceedingly well.  Turns happen quickly, especially with simultaneous action.  The venting / engine working are both very thematic.

Downside is that I can see this being a big AP game for some players.  No issue with the GF's AP on this one though.

Virtually no player interaction, despite card drafting as a core mechanic - even if you know how your opponents' cars work and what color dice they need, you can of course only take one card.

Got a bashed up copy of the Kickstarter game for 25 Euros after some negotitation in Essen.  Like the idea, but not a steampunk fan.  in the end, as James mentioned, it is one of the first syeampunk themes that makes any sense.  The game is fun: assemble a rattling pile of junk and race while bits fly off.  A bit too many repeated construction elements, and some of the wild cards distract from the race.  Turns are fast and you don't have to wait long until your next activity.  Only two tracks is restricting but I imagine expansions are on the way.  You can build up some pretty wicked machines along the way.

All dice rolling/placement games must at least partially balance the value of high and low rolls (or be banished). Steampunk Rally's venting system does this nicely. The draft never sticks you with useless cards because you can always discard for cogs, if not dice, and even building parts you don't like as insurance against damage is effective. More solitaire than one might expect from a drafting/racing game, but enjoyable nonetheless.

I really like this race game. It's probably the heaviest I have and the (literal and games mechanic) engine building is extremely satisfying. You can easily stall/fall apart if you don't balance your machine well. Both times we've played so far have been teaching games which take far longer than the should as we took turns to keep it easier to learn, rather than simultaneous play. I long to play this more so that we can have far faster games (like we do with Roll for the Galaxy) but worry we won't ever get to that point. The interaction is fairly low in this game, but I don't feel it's that mean as it tends to affect everyone and keeps the game a challenge.

Rarely does a game rub me the wrong way, but this one sure did.  I really just didn't care for it at all.  Perhaps it was because we played with 5 players, but I found the card drafting annoying and unsatisfying.  Whether you draw and keep the 4 random cards nets pretty much the same effect as drafting, why bother with the drafting, it wastes time.  Also the dice allocation and invention building mechanisms were rather BORING and mindless.  There are just SO MANY better card drafting / dice allocation mechanism games out there, why oh why would I want to play this?

I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Steampunk Rally. It doesn't do anything that innovative, but it combines a lot of mechanisms that have worked well in other games to great success. You've got the ship-building influences of Galaxy Trucker, the card drafting of games like 7 Wonders, the dice mitigation of Castles of Burgundy, and the race style of Jamaica all rolled up into a game that really works. The ending can sometimes be a bit anti-climactic, and the replay value isn't quite where I want it to be. There are some other minor nitpicks I could mention, but this is really a fantastic racing game. I love the theme of famous inventors coming up with these crazy contraptions to race each other. This is one of those Kickstarter games that doesn't feel like a crowd-funded project, and with an expansion or two, Steampunk Rally could be solidified as one of my favorite games of all time.

Finally a game with Tesla that looks like fun. This racing game has a cool steampunk theme with amazing bits (although the KS version beats the retail in this regard) and a lot of simultaneous actions so that is plays quickly even with large player counts (which go up to 8). I am pretty keen on it, and after watching Richard Ham's run through I have no choice but to pick it up.

This game feels like it was designed with me in mind. Renowned scientists in a steampunk alternate reality building compelling machines via drafting while in a race to the finish line. With dice!! I was relieved to find that this game not only appeals to me conceptually, but is undoubtedly fun. I grin like a dumb kid the entire time I build and power my machine, and look around the table at the other crazy contraptions my friends have built.

Update: This has proven with repeat plays to be my grail game. It has everything I love in board gaming and I doubt I'll ever look down on it in comparison to another title. This has earned a 10 for me.

The components are nice, with good illustrations. The dice are small. The KS included metallic cogs that won't be part of the retailer versions.

It's a race game with a very cool concept and mechanisms, but it also works really well. It's quite fluid, with occasional moments of AP.

The luck factor comes more from the card draft than from the die. Some people also complains about it being random, but I didn't see it to be that random.

It accommodates a great diversity of players (2-8) because of its simultaneous gameplay, but this comes at the cost of not following what the other players are doing.

I would have appreciated a little more diversity of everything. I have the impression of having seen everything after just one gameplay.

RATING: 6
The dice management puzzle is rather intriguing but the game is almost total solitaire. The constant waiting for other players to figure out their puzzle actions makes the game move very slowly, and doubly so if anyone is trying to check that others are not making mistakes in their calculations.

Supposedly includes a drafting element but the drafting part is almost irrelevant, unless you want to pick out the ridiculous take that cards.

Graphic design is only halfway there. For example, the roads on the board tiles do not fit together, and the supposedly color-coded decks are very hard to distinguish.

Great theme and artwork, and some interesting game elements, but lacks quite a bit in player interaction.  During the "race" phase of each turn each player just kind of shuffles around dice on their boards and moves on the track without anyone needing to know what's going on.

Grafica incantevole, ambientazione piacevole e coinvolgente, generatore di confusione e risate. Queste le cose che ho apprezzato di più. L'idea è simpatica, lo sviluppo ben riuscito anche se entrare nell'ottica delle dinamiche non è immediato. Poi via verso la corsa più pazza del mondo, con macchine scoppiettanti pronte a esplodere o a resistere fin oltre il traguardo. Gioco che va giocato in chiave spensierata. Alcune, poche, carte creano un po' di interazione e qualche cosina lo fa il draft, per il resto però lo vivo come un solitarione dove ognuno è curvo sulla propria creazione. Visti le tante combo che si possono creare e le meccaniche di attivazione dadi non è difficile sbagliarsi e ancor più facile barare spudoratamente, cosa però che in un gioco di questo tenore sarebbe veramente molto triste.

[b]Steampunk Rally[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Steampunk Rally has gone on to become my favorite drafting + game. Card/tile drafting is one of my favorite mechanisms in games and SR manages to do an excellent job of incorporating it into a invention building/racing game. It shares some similarities with Galaxy Trucker as far as the machine building goes, but I much prefer the draft versus real time aspect of Galaxy Trucker. There is a good fair amount of player interaction via some of the event cards and races can be neck and neck or a perceived blow out, but I've also seen someone who was way behind be able to pull off an amazing turn and be back in the thick of it. The production is also top notch, like all Roxley published games, and is a great game for families an gamers alike.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Another excellent family game from the publishers of Super Motherload.
- Great integration of theme, mechanics and art.
- Roxley has published another game that combines different game mechanics in a new way, in this case card drafting and dice manipulation. 
- Building your invention is a lot of fun and the fact that you can rearrange it at any point makes it easy to modify your contraption as you get new parts.
- Double sided tiles add variety to the race courses (plus you don't use all the tiles for each race).

This has been a home run with my kids. All of the different mechanics in the game blend together seamlessly. It is fun to draft the different machine parts you can use to build your invention and there is quite a bit of variety in how you can construct it. The action cards sometimes steer you in a different direction when building in order to get a really helpful benefit. The racing part of the game is also quite fun, there is enough to manage to make you think, but it is not overly complex. Finally you have the dice manipulation puzzle to figure out each turn. It's entirely possible to start with one die and by the end of your turn have placed 7 or 8 more dice in your invention and generate a lot of movement. Of course this could result in your invention exploding, but even if this happens its more funny than upsetting because you can recover. At this point anything Roxley publishes will automatically be on my radar, they are two for two with me.[/i]

Some really cool mechanics but a weird simultaneous play structure that I'm not sure how I feel about yet.  I generally love simultaneous play, as it is implemented perfectly in a game like Race.  However I feel like when things occur matters more in this game, which makes the lack of a turn structure feel chaotic to me.  Despite that, I still love the art, the abilities, the draft, and other aspects of the game.  Could go up or down in the future.

Interesante juego que detrás de una propuesta relajada y casual encierra una buena dosis de complejidad más enfocada a los jugadores experimentados. La mecánica básica es ir drafteando cartas al estilo 7 Wonders para armar tu maquina y luego activar esas cartas para ganar recursos y activar otras cartas por más recursos y acciones. Este encadenamiento es más demandante de lo que a primera vista pudiera parecer y la incertidumbre de las cartas que te tocan o los efectos take-that que disparan los jugadores hacen más difícil de planificar con coherencia. Por otra parte, la eficiencia de llevar la maquinaria al máximo hasta hacerla destruirse merma el valor del esfuerzo puesto en construirla. Es una engine que tenés que armar una y otra vez atándote a lo que salga. Tomándoselo como trash, para divertirse y que gane quien gane, pasa. Si todos se ponen a cranear, el paso del juego se empantana, el caos del juego se hace notar y la frustración sube como la espuma de una olla a presión. La producción está muy bien, tanto en los componente como en el arte, pero el gameplay no me termina de cerrar.

A fine game, dragged down by the iconography on the cards and board (important details like the presence of a thin green arrow that do not read clearly at the size they have been printed).

There are other annoying choices - similar-looking player standees on small boards that get in the way of important details on the side of the track. Unfortunate color choices of gold, light copper, silver, and black. Cards that come from four different draw piles that all have the same card back (presumably to ensure players don't gain any information by waiting to pass their hand).

Would still play (and kvetch) again.

I actually enjoyed Steampunk Rally quite a bit, though I am a bit of a sucker for engine-building games (and I was tickled by the fact that this was an engine-builder about literally building an engine). I'm not a big race game guy, but here the race aspect felt secondary to building up your stuff. I was a little concerned about the simultaneous play, as it's difficult to make sure everyone is on the up-and-up, but it does do a good job of speeding things along. We did encounter some timing issues that, looking back at the rules forums, probably shouldn't have happened--maybe some cards were accidentally played out of phase or something. In any case, this game did the engine building thing very well, it was really neat how everyone got to build very different engines, of different sizes, and allowed them to (and sometimes forced them to) change them along the way.

Reminiscent of Galaxy Trucker, but far more enjoyable. Apart from one behemoth of a machine which lumbered around the track unblemished and in last by quite a distance, the other inventors built different styles of machine with varying degrees of success, but a good time was had by all. Despite the generally simultaneous play, the game was prolonged - not so much by AP - but by an engine-building fashioned engine which generated perpetually slow motion. Decent.

This one is interesting.

This is a resource management game unlike any I've played before.   Over the course of the game you'll be developing weird, wondrous and wonky racing machines, and doing everything you can to spur it on towards victory.
However, while cultivating your own literal engine and keeping it operational is fun and makes you feel like a genius, it isn't interactive.  
Every player will be off in their own world doing their own thing, and the only time they'll ever look up is to wonder who's in the lead.

Still, if that sounds like your cup of tea, you'll have a great time.

Wanted to like it, but it's just an ok game for me. Reason? Most of the time, you're just watching your machine, oblivious to what your opponents are doing. At some point you just raise your head and see that everyone did some progress, but how? No idea. 

I don't have anything against eurogames with low interaction (heck, I love some!), but I need a reason to at least observe my opponent closely. Here, during the main phase you're locked in your little world, everyone else just disappears. And I don't enjoy it, as it ruins my social experience. 

Mechaincally, it's still fun. Building the machine, looking for great card combinations, trying to figure out how to best use your dice - that's all great. If not for my personal complaints, I would have liked it more for sure.

I've played this once and it was a blast.  It feels like a frantic race between crazed inventors in spite of the lack of any timer.  

There is card drafting and simultaneous play, so the whole thing scales fairly well for a large number of players.  Draft hands are relatively small (4 cards, one of each kind) and there are fistfulls of dice so chance affects play, but so does planning.  Having only played once it is too early for me to give a proper review, but I really want to play again.

One said it will loose its flair quickly, another mentioned that since everyone is really playing their own game they could easily make a mistake without anyone catching it or even cheat. This will need some house rules and an FAQ soon.

I've played this game a few times in recent months, and expect I'll play again, as it seems to be relatively popular in my groups. I find the mechanics interesting, and there is a nice feel of building your own crazy machine (and then watching it get blown apart, most likely) - enough to rate the game a 7. But I'm certain I will never increase this rating, and can easily see me decreasing it after future plays. It just never seems to flow particularly well - of course, the fact that everyone moves simultaneously reduces downtime (a 4+p game would surely be intolerable if everyone did their movements individually), but this results for me in a more "detached" feel, and means there is no interaction outside the draft (other than the "interactive" action cards playable during the vent phase). I also don't like the graphic design of the board, finding it hard to make out where the individual spaces are.

Definitely a game I feel I can take or leave. But overall quite enjoyable.

We picked up Steampunk Rally from Kickstarter. My girlfriend was very excited about the look of it, which meant that I have to give it a good try! :) 

First impressions - everything looks great. Artwork is super. Cards are of good quality. There's LOTS of cool looking dice! We got the metal cogs, which are very impressive. The board pieces look nice and are a decent thickness. The overall weight of the box is fine. All  in all, it's a great start for me.

As my girlfriend was so excited about this game, the unthinkable happened - she read the rules and explained them to me (normally always my job!). So I haven't read the rules from scratch, apart from looking up the odd rule here and there. But from what I've seen, the rules are all done quite well and explain things nicely. 

Onto the game then and this is where things dip a little for me. A turn is made up of a few phases. The first is a draft phase - take a card and pass the rest on. So there's an element of wanting to know how your opponent's vehicles work - so you don't pass on an amazing card to them. This part works fine. Venting phase, you spend cogs to vent off existing dice from your vehicle - this is where the game starts to move into the solo-player phase. It gakes little more than a cursory statement to your opponents as you remove dice pips here and there. Next is the race phase, and where I believe the game both gains and loses a lot of its charm. As the game goes on, your vehicle will get bigger and bigger - more interconnecting pieces generating certain dice which you will use in other parts of your machine. Optimizing the best way to balance your available dice, with preparing for future turns, movement and damage to your vehicle - the whole interaction can be quite intricate and fun. However, this part is entirely a game of solitaire. As I play with my girlfriend, I do watch her perform her turn. But as far as the gameplay goes, I don't really need to if I assume she won't cheat. We can just both do our solitaire gaming and just move ourselves along the course, as applicable, and take damage where required. Then we can both finish this part of the turn at the same time. Do i really need to know that she's taking a blue dice to put into a part which allowed her to generate 3 red dice, which allows her to move? Since I can't influence her vehicle at this stage of the game, all I really need to know is how far she has moved by the end of the turn. The lack of interaction at the key part of the game was pretty disappointing for me.

And then we do it all again until one person crosses the finish line, whereapon all players have one more turn to finish as far past the line as possible - furtherest player winning. This is actually a good winning condition - just letting your vehicle crawl over the line first is not a way to win!

For components, near the end of the 2 player game I noted that between us we had over half the blue dice attached to our vehicles. So a 4 player game would have been running low/out of blues and a 5 player game would have definitely been without. There's a LOT of dice with the game, but it doesn't seem enough for a bigger game.

Overall, I like the theme. I like the idea of the game. I like the drafting aspect. I do like the fiddlyness of building my best possible vehicle and it can be fun trying to optimise how to use all the parts of my vehicle to get the most out of it. But the game does feel a little bit let down by the solo player aspect of the main part of the turn. So while I feel this is a decent/good game that I'd be happy in playing again, I don't feel it will ever be a go-to game for me.

Very rare. Great worker placement game with card drafting element (ala 7 Wonders) for 8 players ! Simultaneus play results in very dynamic game with little or...after a while....(almost) none downtime. Luck involved is very acceptable and...for me at least...even welcomed as it makes the game more fun and fits the theme. Beware, it is not suitable as an entry game, you need 1 or 2 games to master the rules and fully enjoy the game.

And theme....very nice, family friendly even a little educational in some ways.

There is no game like this which plays and feels great for 3 players as well as 8 players and has this kind od depth. 7 Wonders comes close, but it is completely different game, more filler like (lighter and quicker with different feel and style).

Components and production value is good (at least Kickstarter version with metal cogs and translucent dice). Only cards are bellow average quality (or they feel like that).

Love it!  Recommend not playing the race phase simultaneously though.  This game can lose a lot of its fun if you have an awesome roll that allows you to pull off an amazing combo you've been trying to setup for the past 3 rounds, and the only thing anyone notices is that you moved a few more spaces on a board.

RATING: 8.5
An engine-builder, where you're trying to manage building your machine, collecting dice to run the parts of your machine, and getting cogs to remove used dice or manipulate dice.  You then have to balance moving forward on the race track, building your shields, and taking damage on various spots of the track (or timing when you activate special winged movement to avoid taking damage).  With simultaneous actions and very little interaction between racers (a few cards trigger off whether you are behind other racers), it can feel very much like multiplayer solitaire and not so much a racing game.  I compare it most closely to Lewis and Clark, but in that game there is more interaction through the worker placement and grabbing face-up cards that other players saw and were planning to get.  I enjoy drafting, but in this game you don't see cards again (unless you're playing with less than 4 players) and you don't get the same feeling of drafting cards to set yourself up for being able to pay for better cards or making the critical pair or 3-of-a-kind that you get in games like 7 Wonders and Sushi Go.  It's very much just take the best card for you right now - take machine parts that will work well with your current machine and try to get the right colors of dice and sufficient cogs to do what you want to do that turn.

Update: upgraded from 7 to 9. With more players, it's a real blast. The drafting is a minor part - just a way to have a little more choice than if you simply drew a hand of 4 cards. But there is quite a bit of interaction from boost cards, and it does feel a lot more like a race than Lewis and Clark. The theme really works well, and made for some great narrative about what type of invention you created or when pieces started blowing off. For my friends that aren't big fans of race games, this one allows them to enjoy the engine building aspect and still have a blast.

I liked building my machine and making an engine for dice conversion.  Throw in drafting to pick the machine parts...woo I'm in.  Interestingly enough the racing portion of the game felt like the piece that was tacked on to replace some score track.  I wasn't crazy that the last round or so was just a mad dash where your machine didn't end up mattering.  I guess that is different from other games and very thematic, but ...well, I just wan't as huge of a fan of it.  There also seems to be the ability to get very far behind at which point you don't feel like you can reasonably catch up.

I had lots of fun with this mid-weight engine building/ racing game. Sometimes there are really nice combos to pull off, sometimes you jump ahead many spaces but then your invention breaks down and you are just like: "I didn't see that coming..." while everyone else just has to laugh. Definitly best with fewer players (up to 4 is good) that are not prone for AP.

I do enjoy my time with this game and I love the silliness of creating a racing machine from scrap. Its not really a crowd favorite for some reason.

RATING: 7
This is a racing game at its core with a neat amalgam of other elements.  Along with the basic racing elements is a simple drafting phase, vehicle building, and ability and pseudo-resource management.

In this game each player is a famous inventor racing a crazy contraption to the finish line (think the classic Hannah Barbara cartoon wacky races but with Edison and Einstein instead of cartoon dogs).  At the start of each round is a drafting phase.  Each player draws four cards from four different decks, takes one and plays it immediately (or saves it if it is a boost card), then passes the rest.  The boost cards are instant effects that do a variety of different things and all the other cards are either new pieces to your vehicle or can be discarded for dice or cogs.  After the draft phase is the meat of the game where players roll dice and place them on spots on their vehicle pieces to get certain effects such as movement, vehicle repair, or even gaining more dice.  There is a neat little opportunity cost mechanic where the higher the die number rolled many times the better effect you can get but also dice lock up action spots until they are removed by spending cogs and the higher the pip-count on the die the more cogs need to be spent.

The biggest obstacle during the race are terrain spaces that do damage to players vehicles (making them remove pieces).  Other than that it is just about efficient drafting and use of your resources and a little bit of luck to see who gets to the finish line first.

I think this game is very rough around the edges and think it has a decent number of issues.  But before I go over those I want to preface that by saying I actually like this game.  I think the theme and gameplay are both original enough to give me an overall positive feeling when playing the game despite the multitude of problems.

First, one of the more minor problems, is the turn order mechanic in this game.  A marker is placed randomly between two players and flips each turn to mark which direction cards are passed during the draft.  This means only 2 people ever get to be first player during the game and there are times when if multiple players want to play a card simultaneously this matters.  The fact that in my first game there were 5 players and 3 of them never got an opportunity to be guaranteed first action really rubbed me the wrong way.  This also leads directly into another issue I had with the game, the rulebook isn't the best.  We had a few issues after just one play that weren't clearly defined in the rulebook.  I get that writing a rulebook that covers all the different game anomalies is difficult but if a first play encounters two issues that need more clarification and it can't be found then they are probably common enough they should be explained, one such issue (whether Vent phase cards can be played before and/or after venting) came up multiple times during the same game.

That transitions into one of the bigger problems I have with the game, the imbalance in the boost cards.  Some of them were CRAZY while others were garbage.  The designers also seemed to have this misguided notion that the smaller your vehicle the worse off you were doing, so many boost cards give you an even crazier effect just for having a vehicle with fewer pieces.  My vehicle never exceeded 5 pieces during the whole game and I came in second, the person in first finished with a vehicle with 3 pieces,so it clearly isn't that much of a detriment to deserve such better rewards.

From there, I want to talk about the vehicle building.  The rules say you can rearrange your vehicle pieces at any time.  Honestly I would just hide that rule from anyone new you're teaching, it's stupid.  That takes away such a big piece of what this game should have.  The different pieces have different connections a la Galaxy Trucker and like that incredible game a placed piece should be locked.  Being able to manipulate your design for free and at any time takes away any tension and almost any purpose of even having variable connection paths on your vehicle parts.  Not to mention certain of those crazy powerful boost cards also reward you for things like "having no open connectors" and makes them even easier to achieve when you can rearrange your device to not have open connectors, take the effect, and then just rearrange again to get the ability to build more off of your contraption.

Finally, I dislike the mechanic where a "racing" game finishes one turn after someone crosses the finish line.  To me, that doesn't make it a racing game.  That is essentially the same as having a score track where the game ends one turn after someone reaches a point total and the highest score wins.  I don't have an issue with that scoring mechanic but it makes it not truly a racing game.  A racing game ends with the winner being the first person to cross the finish line.  I'm even okay with simultaneous turns and the winner is the person who went furthest past the finish line on the same turn but it is contrary to the mentality of "racing" and wanting to get there first when really it's the person who has the best turn AFTER someone decides to cross the finish line.

Anyway, I know that is a lot of negatives, and they shouldn't be ignored.  This game could have used a lot more cleaning up and it is clear it is from a new designer and publisher.  They have some good stuff here but it wasn't done baking before they took it out of the oven.  I would still play this unfinished game though and enjoy myself.

This is a multiplayer solitaire game masked as an interactive racing game. The concept is amazing but its just a lot of people doing their own thing once the drafting phase is up. 
A whole lot of chaos at the end game too. Definitely not a gateway game.

Fitting steampunk game. Feels like you're building something functional, but outlandish, and that could be destroyed around every corner.

An original game, and it makes good use of the card-drafting mechanism as one element of game play.  I very much enjoyed the strategic decisions that are part of the drafting phase, and then the chaos that comes from the race phase.  There are a lot of mechanisms that work together, and the first time playing, it may take a couple rounds before the optimal decision process becomes clear. When playing with beginners, it may be beneficial to run a couple rounds, then reset and start over when everyone understands what is going on.  

What is really good about the game system is that multiple game play styles still allow different players to play the game differently but still feel like they have equal opportunity to win the game.  For example, one player may like to build their machine, and find they have a massively complex engine, that starts slow but allows more dice to be generated during the race.  Another player may keep their machine light, discarding cards to gain a larger dice pool so they can use them the most efficiently.  One player may choose to proceed slowly, but gain shields to protect their most valuable machine parts and cogs to vent them, while another may race ahead, taking damage and ejecting parts, and suddenly find themselves without locomotion.

A good game for people who want to think during their game, and who enjoy building an engine to accomplish a goal, and balancing elements of gameplay.  Not so great for people who prefer lighter games that allow more interaction, as most of the game strategy is accomplished without other player input.

A brilliant game full of glorious Rube Goldberg machines that clank, putter, and rattle across the finish line. A ton of fun with not a lot of downtime. 

A downside...there is a lot of random, from the card drafting to the dice rolls. The gears help mitigate some of that but I can't help but think I might have won that last race because I came across TWO cheat cards while my machine was essentially maxed out and not going anywhere. Without those I definitely wouldn't have won.

Kickstarter package with metal cogs and translucent dice.

I enjoy this game when I play it, and I love the shiny dice. But for some reason, it's really not one I'm excited to pull off the shelf terribly often. 

It's possible that the game favors a "big machine" strategy which slows down turns quite a bit. Even if the game doesn't favor that strategy, most players do, as the chain reactions are one of the more interesting aspects of game play.

It also sits in a strange limbo place, where if you play everything simultaneously, the game moves quicker but you feel a lot like you're playing solitaire. But if you wait and watch each player manipulate their contraptions, the game can drag on quite a long time.

It's a racing game. But not really. It's a worker placement game where the workers are dice in different colors and you get to build your mat of worker spots with cards that are drafted. All cool stuff and it all works together well.
The racing part is there, but the main joy comes from building your contraption and activating the actions with your dice.

This game is great! It like a mixture of every mechanic I love! Dice Manipulation/Placement, Card Drafting, Engine Building... I love it! 

I love the idea of building up your machine. The race track is basically a glorified score track for how well your machine is built.

By the end of the game, we had the guy 5 places behind everyone, jump up 5 places ahead of everyone because the way he built his machine to produce extra dice.

Steampunk Rally understands that card drafting is at its best when it's in service of something other than a mere accumulation of points. How about a contraption race?

Steampunk Rally is a dice placement racing game where you're drafting parts for your car/plane/invention doohickey. Every round you get four cards (each card is a different type of thing from one of the four decks). You take one and pass the rest. You do this until you've played four cards. Different cards either give you parts that can generate dice or allow you to convert dice to movement/shields/other dice. There's also boost cards that do cool things. If you ever can't use a card for its intended purpose there's also a discard bonus on the card, usually some dice or cogs.

After the drafting phase there's the venting phase (more on this in a bit) and then the race phase where you activate your machine and do your stuff. Then you start a new round and keep going until someone passes the finish line.

When you run your machine you roll the dice you generate and then place them on your machine to move (or get shields or more dice). Some spots will take any value but most have a certain pip threshold value. If you place a 6 pip die on a 3 pip spot, it gives you two activations. Dice stay on your machine unless you spend cogs in the venting phase to remove them (each cog lowers the die value by 2 until it hits zero and is removed). Once the die is gone you can use the spot it occupied again.

Moving over mountains damages your shields. If your shields go negative, then you'll have to give up car parts at the end of the round. Losing more parts than you have is bad and puts you in last place. The game end is triggered when someone passes the finish line. Then there's one more turn and whoever is furthest past the finish line wins.

I don't know if I can give a fair opinion of this game. In my play there were a number of factors that really contributed to an unpleasant experience. First and foremost, I had a really bad headache and that made it hard to enjoy. Second, I made stupid draft choices the first two turns and basically screwed myself... which wasn't fun. Third, a couple of players misunderstood the rules and were inadvertently cheating by moving much further than they should have. We may or may not have caught/fixed all that.

Finally, there was a rules question about whether you could voluntarily ditch car parts that was answered incorrectly... which really messed me up. I ended up in a situation where for three draft picks in a row I wanted to add parts to my car that only fit if I could put a piece on the back of my car. As I was told I couldn't give up a car part by choice, I got screwed when I couldn't open up any rear slots. I also had a cool card that could only be triggered if I lost 3 car parts in a turn and it ended up being really hard to make that happen without being able to ditch parts voluntarily.

The game has an interesting idea, but it just didn't seem that fun to me. Maybe that's all due to the factors I listed above... but honestly, this just doesn't really seem like the type of thing I would enjoy normally. There was also a fair bit of randomness in the game. A couple of players got cool cards in the first or second round that basically let them ignore mountains and take the (only) very rocky shortcut. There were cool cards that other players picked up that I just never saw at all. I'm putting an asterisk next to my initial impression of the game, but I'm not really eager to give it another chance.

this is the game I found most difficult to let go. I love love love drafting, engine building and fueling the engine with dice, but hate the race (which is the whole point of the game). Let's see if there are other engine builders out there that scratch that itch...

RATING: 7.5
[thing=162007][/thing] is a racing game, with draft of cards. Basically, there are two main phases in the game: first, the draft, in wich players receive 4 cards, choose one and pass the other three to another player, than receives three, choose 1, pass the other 2, and so on. In this phase, the players can add parts to their machines, gain dice, gain cogs and/or stash boost cards, to be used later. To add card to the machine, it must have a legal place to be put one (all the parts of the machine must have a way to reach the cockpit, but is legal to have parts that don't connect with others or with half-connections between them). It is when you don't add parts to your machine that you can gain what is written in the card (dice or cogs).

The second main phase is the race, in which players use the dice to activate the parts of the machine, in order to produce more dice and several effects (like gain shield, release dice, gain cogs and, most important, make the machine move). It is possible to use cogs to re-roll or to add 1 to a die (the maximum value is still 6). The machines move in a racing track and they suffer damage when passing by some places, as indicated in the board. If the amount of damage makes the damage gauge to reach negative value, the machine has to lose 1 part for each point bellow zero - if there isn't enough parts to lose (or if the damage goes to -8 or more) the machine "breaks" and the player goes to last place in the race. If the damage gauge is zero or positive, nothing happens (and the positive value remains for later, as a buffer against damage).

Dice used in the machine stay on it, and to remove them it is necessary to ventilate (in the vent phase) them (spending cogs to lower the number on the die by 2, if the number reaches zero, the die is taken out) or use the effect of some other part of the machine that allows to take them out. This basically represents the machine clogging up or shutting down, losing capacity during the race, so is necessary to make repairs and maintenance in the go to make it work as close to maximum as possible.

The winner will be the player whose machine goes further away - not necessarily the one that crosses the finish line first, as the game works in simultaneous turns, and crossing the finish line only triggers the end of the game, which will happen in the end of the next round of play. It doesn't matter if your machine is whole, prestine or cute (but having more parts is the tiebreaker) - the goal is to make it go farthest.

And how it plays? For me, better than [thing=68448][/thing], as this one isn't neutral for me - it has a good gameplay, but I'm not really involved in actually building something, I have just a very minor feel of making a civilization. [thing=162007][/thing] is what [thing=68448][/thing] could be if you had to really build a Wonder, using alien tech and than putting them to race against each other - my bet would be in the rocket-propelled spidery legged Pyramid, as it would have lots of shields, as you know it was built to sustain damage.

I really enjoyed the way you can build your machine, put the pedal to the metal, wreck it all up in order to go one or two spaces more, than starting frantically rebuilding it with whatever parts you can find in order to keep going. Or you can go steady, keeping your shields strong, and hoping to breakout near the end. It is possible to go with big machines, with lots of parts, or small ones, using more cogs, dice and boosts to advance. The game allows for different approaches wich is great. And coupled with the big replay value, as not even close of all cards are using in the game, the roster of 16 different Inventors (pilots), the modular board to make the racing track and, of course, the dice themselves, and you get a huge replay value.

The icons are easy to understand and there is text in the boost cards to complement the symbols or to describe the action. Only once, in three games, we need to use the manual (to check if there was a maximum use of cogs in a given round - there isn't, but they can't take a die above 6). The manual is necely done and the cards have beautiful art. The dice, for the Kickstarter edition, are top notch, translucent and with rounded corners. The metal cogs make for an awesome tactile entertainment.

The game isn't hard to teach, but it might take one play to really "get" everything. The learning curve isn't steep - is mostly around timming: when to force ahead, when to add or take out a part, when to get dice, when to slow down. And most of this will be player driven - if the others are going fast, staying too much behind may be too risky, and if everyone is cautious and aren't investing in movement, sprint with everything you got might do the trick, even if you are left with only a cockpit afterwards. Building the machine is easy enough, you won't get a [thing=31481][/thing] pressure, at the most, one time or another, you will want to add something and might have a problem deciding if the new part is better than an old already there.

The counterpoint of the positiveness is a good deal of lack of player interaction. Once the draft phase ends, the interaction is limited to some boost cards - some with "take that" actions (but, usually, not aimed to a particular player, instead they affect everyone) and others that act on a player, but aren't really bad (like one that allow a player to take dice from the other players machines). So, for the most part, the Vent phase, the Race phase and the Damage phase, all will happen with everyone minding their own business, specially because all of them are simultaneous. This may fit well for families and friendly games, but for those looking for a Rocking Roll Racing or Super Mario Kart feel, well, you won't find this in here. And yes, there is a fine amount of luck - it comes with the territory, and you should expect this from reading the words "dice" and "draft". Finally, at least for the first couple of plays, it will require both trust - not against cheating, this is given in almost all games -, but that the other players are actually playing right, so, until everyone gets the hang of it, the "simultaneous play" won't really be there, as it was usual for us for players to wait to see if what they are doing is correct, which will increase the time of play in a good deal.

Anyway, [thing=162007][/thing] pleased the everyone at the table (we played three times in a row) and this is enough to put it in the "win" table. The theme is strong, present in the actions, names and actions. The downtime is short (basically waiting someone else finish a phase). There are lots of possibilities and strategies to try and apply. All of this together are enough for me to recommend it for those looking for a nice looking game and a more layback racing game.

The graphic design is just terrible - the worst I've seen in a long time. Many of the icon choices are bad, the figures are difficult to tell apart, and the small amount of important information on the board is hard to see against the busy background. And with all that, it's not even attractive - it's muted and ugly.

The gameplay isn't as bad as that, but it's not great and is marred by poor design choices. E.g., if you don't get one of the cards with four connectors early you might not be able to add more than one card, which is not going to work. Therefore the only smart move on the first choice of the first turn is to take the card of that type you have - so it's not actually a choice. Why not give one of the starting cards more connectors so players have actual choices early?

The theme of this racing game is really appealing, but I find that I still have to warm up to it. On the one hand, players are building these wonderful contraptions, trying hard to design the optimal racing engine. On the other, powerful action cards and the players' own dice may well foil their well laid plans. Ultimately, the game might be a bit too random for me, but I still want to give it another go.

Amazing game. It's loads of fun either constructing a behemoth of a vehicle able to withstand any terrain and punishment, or making a tiny, ever-changing rocket that clatters across the country, dropping bolts and cogs with every bump.

I'm a fan of dice placement games.  Or, at least I thought I was.  Liked Alien Frontiers.  I remember liking Troyes, but only played it once years ago.  Have read through The Voyages of Marco Polo and it made sense.  And have played numerous much lighter games.  Then I played Colony and just absolutely loathed the experience.  Just seemed liked complexity for the sake of complexity and a complete detachment from theme.  Despite how light Steampunk Rally is, I feel the same way about it.  Place dice, do some math.  Tweak this, tweak that.  I just don't care.  I sold away Alien Frontier years ago because of its bash the leader problem.  That's minor compared to what I'm seeing games like Colony and Steampunk Rally.  I have to go against the grain on this title.  Don't like it.  Don't like games that resemble it.

Well, this ends up being an awkward experience all around. This game isolates everyone into a solo playing arithmetic challenge of counting dice and what you can do with them. The interaction between players is so little and insignificant it feels like everyone just sat around the table to do math homework at the same time. 

It can be interesting to think through the possibilities of how to race as quickly as possibly but this only serves well as math homework, not an actual game. Casual players have a difficult time picking up the rules so you’ll need to proof-read their moves throughout the game which slows things down even further.

After a few play throughs you could get a competitive game but since it feels like you’re playing solo against the board there is no point in playing the game with others. 

Interesting game in a lot of ways but when everything comes together it takes some interesting elements like steam punk and dice play into an overall poor experience.

Fairly enjoyable machine building that takes a rather long time for the overall amount of depth.

Machines can get very complex such that it simply takes a lot of time to figure out how to use them correctly.  Card effects can be pretty uneven and chaotic as well.

Additionally, the game is very awkward as far as turn structure goes.  It slows to a crawl if you go turn-by-turn, but it's often incredibly important to know what others are doing such that just doing things simultaneously doesn't work either.

This game is very impressive. It uses simultaneous play to very cleverly accommodate up to 8 players while keeping playtime to around an hour. I'm a huge fan of dice games and the diceplay in this game is quite clever and among my favorite that I have yet encountered. The "engine-building" is fun and amusingly literal. The mechanisms fit the theme perfectly, and I love the representation of historical figures in the game. Finally, I love the "arc" of the game which build up to ridiculous, flat-out final-turn combos.

The designers said they wanted to make a game with steampunk mechanics, not just a steampunk aesthetic, and they succeeded. The dice placement mechanic that lets you turn (for example) a fire dice into a steam dice that lets you power the motion of your vehicle, only for you to need to put some electricity dice into a vent card to cool down your engine so you can put more steam dice into it really works thematically. Simultaneous turns is a plus (if everyone knows the game well), although player interaction is mostly limited to the card drafting for vehicle parts.

Attractive artwork and quality game components with a good engine building game mechanic.

The theme works well, and I love changing up my Invention on the fly. It's also a funny game, and the real world scientists help make it even funnier. The artwork is also very good, and fits the theme.

Sadly the game is let down by the chaos of its lengthy, and involved action phase. It seems that the only reason the game instructs players to play simultaneously is to speed up what would otherwise take ages. That's of course a good intent, but in execution it means that nobody knows if people have played by the rules, or not. It's just chaos. Everyone is so involved in making their own Invention work that they cannot check if the other players are doing so correctly. That's something I don't like in games.

This is such a great implementation of the theme.  Its fun to put together your contraption and watch it run while trying to time its movements to not take debilitating damage and beat your opponents to the finish line.  The only downside is that to keep the game flowing quickly you should do most things simultaneously so you don't get to always fully appreciate your opponents' cool inventions.  This strong solitaire feeling diminished some in my second game as more people were looking to hate draft and I was fast enough completing my turns to see others people's inventions run a bit but it still stops me from enjoying the game as much as I might.  Still, a game of the depth that scales so beautifully and has such a wonderfully realized theme definitely has a place in my collection.

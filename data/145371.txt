Amazing strategy game. Entered my top 5 games after a very brief time. It has everything I like in a game - amazing strategy potential with multiple paths to victory, godlike replay value with all different generals and combos to try out and phenomenal player interaction through bidding mechanisms where you are always on the edge and in fear that your plans might not work out as planned. Definitely a strong recommendation if you have a group of 3 willing to devote around 3 hours for a deeper strategy game.

RATING: 10
Short version of this review - I ordered immediately after playing at a friends house. Slightly longer and more reasoned thoughts are as below:

When Noel suggested a game of “Three Kingdoms Redux” as last night’s game I can’t say I was overjoyed – the few minutes I scrounged to read up on BGG on it painted a complex game with a BGG complexity rating of 3.97 (just below the 4.03 of my bete noir DS) I frankly feared the worst at the tail end of a log week.
To say I was surprised how good the game was, how mechanically intuitive and thematically fitting it played is a major understatement. I had low expecatations I will admit but it was hugely enjoyable.

The second edition from Capstone is as nicely produced as their games tend to be. The board is clear and unshowy, the card art is great and the only complaint you could level is the vanilla tokens which are like pretty much most tokens you will encounter.

It plays 3 and 3 only joining a pretty small cohort of games in that regard most of which I have played are coincidentally pretty good as well.

It is set in 3rd century China where the weak central rule of the Emperor has collapsed and three warring factions are vying for supremacy. You represent one of these three highly asymmetrical factions each with their own strengths and weaknesses. While there is a small bit of a diret conflict (that is very important score wise) it is really a fantastic hybrid of worker placement, card management and bidding. There are a lot of different moving parts.

You power your faction through placement of your generals who are ranked for their military and administrative skills as well as an ability to lead either one or two armies. Each faction has a unique leader and throughout the 12 turns will ultimately draw nine generals. The starting numbers are slightly different with one faction starting with 6 and the others 5 and 4 respectively. Further draws are made during turns 3,6 and 9 so that ultimately each faction will have nine and their leader out. It means the Shu faction will start with an advantage over the other two but which will be slowly whittled away. The two “losing” factions at the start of the round will be allied for bidding purposes which means that getting a runaway lead is difficult if they act in unison as they can combine forces to win one action they can both use. It is an elegant way to keep things balanced.

There are 12 action spaces on board (6 military and 6 administrative) – the former as you would expect are focused on raising, training and equipping military while the latter are for building markets, developing farms to feed and paying for your military and building public works to keep the populace happy and safe. You use the generals for bidding with the first player in winning ties generally. At the end of the turn the actions are resolved in player order in any order that you wish which is important so for example you need to be sure that if you win the train action that you also win the raise army action and do it first. The generals themselves all have unique benefits so for example you might get a bonus for winning a certain action of additional men or resources and you can set up some great combinations if you have the right generals out. I had for example one general who when using the tax action also collected for any developed markets and was a veritable one man gold mine.

The conflict element takes place on the borders between each player and there are potentially big vps here but they come at a cost. You can attack the border of the player you are allied with as well but its generally wise to try and wait until the other factions go to war before you stick the knife in. You send in a general and at least one army if you want to occupy a border space (5 on each border). The other faction can contest. The winner has the biggest strength and can then occupy a space from which they cannot be removed. If you won the battle with a general’s favorite army type (each general has two favoured types from four available) you get an immediate VP. More importantly you score 1 or 2 VPS every turn depending on how many armies you settle. Over 12 turns you can therefore clock up 24 points from a single space and that is before final scoring. The problem is that the general you place is lost to you from that round on so you’ll be an action down for those VPs each round. You will also need to feed and pay these armies during upkeep or suffer VP losses.

You also need to keep your own populace in line. There is a 12 space track representing your internal hold on power. Starting at 5 or 6 it degrades 1 every turn and if you hit 0 you suffer a revolt and lots of nasty things. You can use a general to pacify with gold or troops to keep this in positive territories.

Finally there is an action that enables you to play various development cards for instant benefits and also end game VPs.

End game is either someone becoming Emperor (another political track action), getting control of 5 of 10 border spaces (almost impossible barring a superbly timed lunge I would have thought as you’d have almost no actions) or at the end of round 12.

After a very late start and the rules explanation we managed 6 turns. Thanks to some lucky drafting and a decent engine I was ahead  but Noel was drawing extra cards and James had just unleashed an absolute monster VP generating combination so there were plenty of swings and roundabouts left.

The only negatives that spring to mind is that it could run long and a particularly bad or good hand from the initial draw could cripple or really boost you although that can surely be house ruled. Overall though great. Mechanically not complex - all the complexity is in the strategy and tactics.

This gem passed me by and seems to have passed many by - don't make the same mistake I made.

Yes a straight 10 after 1/2 a play - its that good .

1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Deep game, many paths to victory, with a few subtle twists that are quite ingenious. The way the alliance moves between players is a brilliant bid-worker-placement mechanism, but I feel it gets weaker as the end of the game approaches. The war component is not repressive, not overly combative, but is confrontational. The powers on the cards are very fun to explore. I like how the round tracker was not the official way to end the game, but rather a safety mechanism to prevent excessive playtime.

DISLIKE: Some iconography, and some chits, are very difficult to discern. Too many powers to keep track of, it felt oddly nebulous, even with the cheat sheet. The language on the cards also takes some getting used to. I also felt it was difficult to isolate where some players were making their best moves from. I felt the separation cards and the other cards (I forget the name) were a bit random.

OVERALL: Good game, but this is a game where the first play will not reveal what the game has to offer. There are multiple paths to victory, so I wasn't sure what to do in my first play, but this is usually alleviated after a few plays.  But there lies the question, how often would this get played? I would happily play this again, but the distinct player count requirement will impede how often the game appears on the table.

RATING: 7.5
+ Love the theme so much; The action selection / bidding mechanic is very tense and can lead to much political posturing very appropriate to the era of the Three Kingdoms.
- Players not familiar with the source material will be overwhelmed by the sheer number of generals and may be put off by the longer-than-normal game length.

This is really a remarkable game : interesting subject, constrained confrontation and alliances, it really takes the problem of the 3 player game by the horns and gives a very satisfactory solution.

I don't have a formed opinion yet of the game, but it's clear that it offers an interesting narrative from early-mid-end game, accentuated by the asymmetry of players. 

This is a worker placement in which the workers (generals) are different one from the other, have special powers, and each side has a ton of them, not to mention the state improvement cards. Replayability is through the roof.

My main problem is that for such a long game, the specific powers of the generals can really be game-changing, so you need to know them (and those of your opponents). This is a game that requires repeated play with the same people, which may be difficult to do.

RATING: 6.5
Playtest once 2013

A good medium heavy game for new gamers. Considered light medium for seasoned gamers. 

Worker placement game with multiple route to victory point acquisition. A good game for the odd 3 player moments. Gameplay is basis and easy to pick up for the regular gamers. 

Will not comment too much here till its published. 

Enjoyed my first game very much. 
_______________________________________________

With the actual published game. 2014

The game packs perfectly into the slim square box if some care is taken into the type of containers you purchase. Component materials are above average but the artwork is top notch. The game board is 6 folded, matt based and mounted.

The game play is exactly what was playtested with some minor changes, notably the battle limitations.

A very good 3 player worker placement game, that could be imagined as Agricola+Lancaster+Village combi. Taking the better of their mechanics and merging them to a smooth flowing game play that is 3KR.

For the first few games, especially for new gamers to worker placement games, the game could already be decided by the leaders made available for you to choose. Provided all 3 players play fairly, any 2 'friends' could relegate the third 'outside' gamer to a losing game. 

Please note : this is a game with 3Kingdom as a theme. Gamers looking for some antagonistic war-ish game will not be found here. There are no climatic battles and no one dies from combat or old age. It's just factors competing for an action space or VP area. Even so, there is no limit to how many generals could compete for an action. So it's possible that all available generals are used on one single action space. Good euro game. Questionable on some resolution of actions. Don't read too much into it. :)

Will probably write up a review, after a few more games (3 players and solo) as well as reviewing all the generals and card combi to come to a, perhaps 'bias conclusion', to this excellent game.

Rated from an euro gamer point of view. 
_______________________________________

The fun factor still remains after all these game sessions. With familiarity, the strategic decisions do change when bidding for actions. 

The selection of generals (and the timing of the entry of these generals) has become a major highlight to winning or losing a game. 

The game expected a certain respond from players. All is good if all players are casual to each other. But once a game begins with disconnected players or 2vs1 syndrome. The game becomes a chore. Actions will be severely hampered and game play on the whole will be frustrating. 

Another point is when a game that has been played too long or too many times. The feel of the game being 3 Kingdom begins to get worst. It does not feel like 3 Kingdom. Neither does it have a feel of China eventually.

As a fellow countryman, I would wish that this game would do well in terms of sales and ranking, but ...

I am a fan of the story of The Romance of Three Kingdom. When I played the game for the first time, I just failed to see what's so Three Kingdom about this game. The marriage of worker placement and the theme just doesn't cut it for me.

Of course, if one chooses to disregard the theme, it becomes a decent game. But why play this game when it's such a frustrating experience for me? We played the beginner version and I felt handicapped throughout the game as Shu. I didn't feel like I had many options as I was always outnumbered and outbidded. I would have preferred Agricola anytime.

Tout simplement excellent! Malgré les grandes différences entre chaque clan au début du jeu, ceux-ci sont parfaitement équilibrés grâce aux interactions entre joueurs. Le thème est parfaitement intégré au "gameplay" et le grand nombre de généraux disponibles par clan permet une très grande rejouabilité puisqu'on en utilise qu'au maximum 8 par game. :)

RATING: 10
Heavy, heavy euro. Spiced up with a tiny bit of randomness with cards, set in a great theme, with clever mechanics and for a euro, very thematic. 3 players only, which can be a problem but at the same time, it allows for very interesting dynamic thanks to the alliance rule. Worker placement where the game allows you to compete with your opponents for an action is great. Nothing sucks more then being blocked from an action you need every turn. It can take way over 3 hours to play (better knowledge of the game should help with this), which can be exhausting (we had 2 headaches in 3 games :) ), but it's a fantastic design. Just make sure you are rested before delving into it.

This game was promising, but it seems it needed a bit more streamlining work - I am afraid it felt 10% like a prototype and 90% as a finished game. Other than that, I do not enjoy worker placement games where while spending a worker, the action is not guaranteed. Overall a good game.

Initial Impression: This game has surprised me. Upon openning the box, you are immediately immersed in Ancient China. The artwork on the board, tokens, and particularly the cards are wonderfully thematic to behold. The gameplay is much simpler than it looks, with a basic worker placement and area control mechanism wrapped in a few secondary mechanisms. Interestingly, the generals (workers) all have stats and abilities which force you to consider where to best place them. However, what sets this game apart, aside from the 3player only aspect of the game, is the incredible story arc that unfolds as the game progresses. The player who first begins the game as the most powerful will have to make the most of his power early as his influence on the board will invariably peter out. I have to admit that this game was nothing like what I was originally expecting and I hope to play it again soon.

RATING: 8.5
Mechanically, it's not complex. Agricola definitely was an influence here and Three Kingdoms is only a bit heavier in pure mechanisms. The weight of this game comes in the player interaction of the action bidding; the constant shifting of alliances; the weighing of the session's progression in view of the player asymmetries (Wei plays aggressive, Wu wants a mid-game finish, and Shu wants a long game); and the need to manipulate the alliances and game state to your advantage. The abstraction of the various activities into a number of different auctions makes each round compelling. The ever-shifting alliances are great. The overlapping of the borders is a fun touch, too.

The resource management aspect of the game is not that difficult, but requires some attention. The different decks of generals are truly fitting to the game. But the different decks also add a bit of artificial depth to the game, since you probably should consider the powers of your opponents' active generals when planning your round (you'll learn the leaders' powers after the first round). It probably isn't worth the effort to internalize the generals' powers.  Overall, it's a high interaction euro with a very interesting, and integrated, theme. Until each player figures out what's going on in the game, this game is likely to take 3+ hours to play. It'll typically take a new player 1/2 a game to get the flow, and a full game to see how the decisions get converted into points. The play time consideration, and the 3 player requirement, really limits how often this game gets played, which is a bit unfortunate.

Great epic, 3 player only game. Brian, Brett and I finished in the 8th round. Brett got his 5th General into a border location. This gave him the game 31-29-28. I really liked the tough choices in this game. Getting outbid in an area was such a killer blow as you have so few generals each turn. Great fun, can't wait to try this again. I think I will bring this to Dice Tower Con to teach, if I can find a group.

Three Kingdoms Redux is a fantastic game that offers a deep and rich gaming experience. You are fully immersed in administering your kingdom; tending to the fields, building a thriving economy, garnering popular support, building military strength, and so forth. You bid on actions with your generals who all have different stats and unique powers. This is one of the best board games I have ever played

RATING: 9.5
The following is my personal thoughts on the game after  approximately 10 rounds of play testing.

I enjoy playing the game and the game is highly replay able. For every game that I played, I get to be involved in the different nations and a wide variety of generals. Till now, I still have not completely use all the generals that are available in the game. For people like me who are easily bored out in going through routine stuff, this game definitely excites me as every game is played differently with different strategies applied due to the the usage of different generals and the cards you had on hand.

Loads of critical thinking and analysis skills can be attained through this game. I feel that I have learnt and improved a lot on my analysis skills after the few rounds of play testing. This is a life-learning skill for me which is definitely good.

However, I will like to point out that the game may seem to be a bit long, as from what I recalled, each game last approximately 3 hours for me. Nevertheless, the time spent for me is definitely worthy from the skills I could enhance and I truly enjoyed the game.

RATING: 9.5
Wow! I was excited to try out this 3-player game, but I didn't realize how much I would love it. My initial feeling is that this will easily shoot up into my top 10 games of all time. It is a beautifully balanced, asymmetrical, strategic, tactical, complex, long, wonderful game! The game creates so many delicious moments of tension and intrigue between the players. We constantly found our selves in devious situations where we could force the hand of the other player's.

Some things I loved:
-The bidding works beautifully and adds so much dynamic tension to the game. The generals you have, the order you play them in, the threat of who you can play later, etc. all add up to a phenomenal game system.
-The alliance is so wonderfully done. It creates an advantage, but also all kinds of tension within the alliance ("why haven't you placed there yet...I'm waiting for you!") and outside of the alliance. 
-The upkeep is perfectly balanced to challenging, but not impossible. There is also a great dynamic of when to place stationed generals (getting VPs early but also requiring upkeep). I also love the need to upkeep the civil harmony track.
-The stationing of generals is a wonderful mechanic. When to do it, who to do it with, what to station, the interplay with the shared border, etc. All so wonderful!
-The scoring is fantastic. Every aspect of the game is a competition with your opponents and there is a perfect tone set in the game of trying to keep up with each of your neighbors.
-We had several of those "Diplomacy like" backstab moments that were just perfect.

The designers have created the best 3 player game I've ever played. You are forced to keep both opponents in check, work with them, manipulate the alliance, still get your agenda completed. Just talking about the game is getting me excited.

Firstly, I would like to state that I am a playtester for Three Kingdoms Redux and have played this game numerous times (more than 70).

Despite playing this game so many times, I have never felt bored with it or felt that the game has grown stale. I think this highlights one of the strengths of this game, which is its replayability. 

The high number of variables (eg. starting generals, kingdoms, enhancements, luck) means that each game requires you to come up with different strategies that not only suit the cards in your hand, but also to counter your opponents. 

The replayability factor is boosted and complemented by the multiple routes one can take to score points and achieve victory. This also makes the gameplay more flexible and unpredictable, as players are able to switch
strategies midway through the game in case things do not go as planned.

Another point which makes the game very enjoyable for me is the high level of strategy involved. To achieve victory, players have to carefully plan and balance their resources (generals, gold, enhancements etc) so that they  maximise their score; and must also be aware not to over-stretch their resources. Also, timing of a player's moves is very critical.

Additionally, being a fan of the stories of Three Kingdoms, I am pleased that the mechanics of the game, designing of generals and the game's overall artwork follows the stories accurately and in deep detail. This would please fellow gamers who enjoy the Three Kingdoms stories.

However, one potential flaw of the game is it being primarily a 3-player game. Players might have more trouble organising and getting fellow gamers to start playing.

All in all, I would recommend this to any gamer who enjoys strategic gameplay.

RATING: 6
It's a special power card game with auctions, engine building and resource conversion. 

The play is smooth. The rulebook is very good. The cards are both gorgeous and thematic! All of the other components are your standard thick cardboard. The game itself does what all strictly 3-player games need to do; it creates situations where the players need to balance themselves. The three sides are asymmetric with different starting benefits meaning different players want the game to end at different times (controllable by the players). It also create multiple viable paths so there's no "switch to VP" inflection point and it does allow players to fight to change the game length. 

It does everything right and it's a solid 8.  The only negatives is that, like all special power card games, it needs multiple plays to shine.  In addition, like all 3-player only games, it needs multiple plays with the same players to shine.  In addition, like all asymmetric games, it needs multiple plays in multiple positions for players to be able to gauge each other's strengths and weaknesses and how to counter them...  See where I'm going with this.

Great game, just not sure it lines up with my gaming opportunities.

I'm enthralled. The best game since Terra Mystica. 

This game has a number of elements which I love:

1) Asymmetry (my favourite game is Terra Mystica).
2) Three player game (Maria, God's Playground, , Star Wars Risk)
3) The game is completely designed around its (Asian) theme. 

Three player games are the best for the delicate balancing act of not hammering one opponent too much to tilt the apple cart.

There is also a lot of replayability because there are 69 generals split amongst 3 kingdoms that play from the asymmetric positions. 

Hints of Agricola inspiration (occupation cards, minor improvements, feeding phase, -3VP penalty, category scoring), but gameplay is nothing like it. You really feel like you're managing your generals and your kingdom. 

Only my 6th game out of 663 games that I rate a 10. And the only game to have received its ten after only 2 plays. 

BRILLIANT!!!

P.S. Ignore the TROLL , Hoss Cartwright, who rated this game a 1. He rates games either a 10 or 1, and apparently before he's even played them.

This game is dense, heavily strategic and tactical and extremely rewarding.  Our first game took 4 hours, we made one big rule mistake and I wanted to play another right away.

The bidding mechanic is super sweet but the fact that it has a huge impact on the next turn order is a masterful design.  It builds tension in the worker placement"ish" nature of the game and has its own catch up mechanic built-in.  Brilliant.

If replayability is your concern, the vast variety of generals you draft and assign to actions will ensure that no game is the same.  Resources are scarce, you'll have to make sure you use what you have efficiently.

Oh, and the alliance.  This seems like a little bonus (which it partly is) but it is so integral to gameplay, it makes the game even more involving and rich.

This is my sleeper hit of 2017 (well my copy is from 2017 anyway...)  I can't say much more about this game, it's pure gold!  If you like the theme, it's even better but not necessary.  The design is brilliant, elegant and even though it looks complicated, it is actually streamlined into a masterpiece of a game.

I get the feeling that the more I'll play this game, the better it'll become.  I could see it becoming one of my top 10 games, if not, it's already in the top 25.

This game has a lot going for it, both mechanism wise and theme wise. Normally I don't like heavy euro games but this one is different because it has SOUL. It's not the normal euro points salad with no heart, like Trajan. This game has much heart, I actually feel like a Chinese lord in the Three Kindgoms era and in mortal conflict with my two rival neighbor lords for the Imperial throne. The theme is crunchy and I appreciate that, it's what I like. So I give this heavy euro game a thumbs up.

An action-bidding worker-placement victory point salad with a dash of area control for good measure. The huge variety of workers (based on historical and fictional characters from the source material) provides both thematic flavor and great replay value. Their individual abilities guide your strategy without dictating it.

Be aware that this is a long and complex game -- the first try is almost guaranteed to take all afternoon. However, if you are not faint of heart, and are interested in the theme, it's well worth the effort.

I can see how someone who's more a fan of heavy Euros than I am would enjoy this game, it has a lot going on. The bidding/worker placement hybrid is a great touch and there's been a lot of thought put into addressing the problems inherent to most 3-player games.

However, 3KR fell flat with me for two reasons. First, the information design of this game is just not good - a lot of time is spent re-acquainting yourself with the game state (distinguishing between Recruited vs. Trained Army is probably the best example). It adds unnecessary mental burden onto an already heavy game.

Second, the theme really did not connect for me, which is too bad because I appreciate how much work the designers put into bringing in real figures from this period in history. But I never once felt like a Chinese warlord trying to win power and influence over my rivals. That may not be an issue for you, but it hurt my experience of the game.

This game is phenomenal.  It's such a pleasantly unique game.  The way that everything balances out over the course of the game works very well (since there are asynchronous starting power levels between the three different kingdoms).  After reading the rules, but before playing, I was a bit scared that there would be one major route to victory (military victory points).  I have found that it is not the case at all, and that there are many paths to victory.  After a few plays I can see that there is a LOT of replay value.  This is one that will definitely be hitting the table for many years to come.

Congrats to the team!

RATING: 9.99
Great game. Reminds me of Shogun / Wallenstein / Im Zeichen Des Kreuzes except the game really leverages the strengths of each generals. In those games, the daimyos (Takeda, Uesugi, Tokugawa, etc) are just used to differentiate the colors with no unique special individual abilities.

Pros:

1. Great application of the theme. Excellent implementation of the general's strengths based off how those generals strengths are portrayed in the novels.
2. Great game play mechanics and execution of the turns.
3. Excellent video tutorial and manual.

Cons:

1. Need to have exactly 3 people. If anyone can come up with Solo or 2 player variants, I'm all ears. This is why it's 9.99 instead of 10.
2. Depending on the strategy, going full 12 rounds takes longer than 165 minutes - more like 180 to 240 minutes. That's assuming no AP takes place and the players understand what they are doing.

Pro / Con depending if one is more of a Euro Gamer or not: No Dice involved.

What It Needs:

1. Variants for more / less players.
2. Expansions: Maybe prequel including Lu Bu, Dong Zhuo, Yellow Turbans, Gongsun Zan, Liu Biao, etc. Sequel with Sima Yi, Liu Chan, etc. Or even expansion within the same time window with Ma Teng, Zhang Lu, Yong Kai / Meng Huo, Yuan Shu, etc.

This is on the heavier side of games I would play. I was really pleasantly surprised by just how good this game is, especially as the first release from a company. The asymmetric gameplay with variable card-based powers reminds me of playing a CCG, which I really like. There is a lot of player interaction which keeps the game feeling tense. I foresee a lot of replayability in this game as the generals will be different in every game, plus there are three different sides to learn. A lot of strategy and demands a lot of focus, but ultimately very rewarding. The only thing preventing me from giving this a higher rating is that I would not always want to play it/I would turn down games of it if I didn't feel like playing a longish, involved, heavier game. I would organise game nights just to play it though.

Initial thoughts are my purchasing options that day were this, Cottage Garden, Hashpelkneckt (sure), or Orient Express all for about the same price...after reading the rules and reviews of each I think I made the correct decision. Now to get it played.

After 1 Play: There are things to like here and things that worry me. The uniqueness of the workers special abilities adds a lot to the game, and since no two workers are the same the replayability is high. For example I chose my generals based on helping me improve my economy without having to spend workers on it, but I passed up other interesting generals for the ones I chose. The same can be said about the state enhancement cards.

I'm a big fan of auctions, and while there isn't anything groundbreaking here, the generals abilities along with the auction makes each turn go from knowing exactly what to do to having to make tough sacrifices when challenged in a location.

Unfortunately the flip side of this is that due to the mechanics listed above, the first game experience was more often than not everyone face down in their own corner of China trying to figure out what the heck is going on. 

I think this will be a game that will require a few plays before an honest grade can be determined. Unfortunately due to its length of play and complexity finding people willing to play multiple times is going to be a challenge in and of itself. However once the game is understood, the scoring seems more along the lines of a Feld point salad. Points are scored based on your relationship to others on all tracks. In that regard, no more complicated than a game like Trajan...but with unique cubes/generals.

For now, I want to play it some more because I really think there's some cool stuff here, and I think getting the playtime down from 3.5 hours to 2-2.5 hours would be a massive help. 

After 5 plays: PENDING

After 10 plays: PENDING

I want to rate this game higher, I really do.  It's not that it's bad or anything like that, but it is a time-cruncher of a game which normally wouldn't be a problem except for the tremendous amount of information you need to keep track of.  It's difficult enough keeping your own abilities and bonuses straight let alone keeping track of another player's, and unfortunately keeping other players in check is a vital component to this game.

I can see that with familiarity (a LOT of familiarity), the game can be exciting and intense, but unless you are going to make this the only game you play for months, if not a year, you won't get to that point and you certainly won't retain that knowledge as you move onto other things.

Mechanically speaking, the game is a sort of combo mishmash between worker placement and bidding for those places.  It's actually pretty fascinating and it works well.  You bid on spaces using your generals (accurately named for the Three Kingdoms novel) and their specific stats depending on the space you're going for.  For example, one space will only count your general's combat strength, whereas another might only count his administrative strength.  If you are absolutely certain on your strategy, you can get into some serious "I hate my friends" bidding wars and that is tremendous fun.  So where is the hump?

The hump is that the card pool is heavily loaded, and I don't necessarily mean in a complex way.  With regards to complexity, the game flows quite easily - you bid on spaces, you resolve them, you score points or set yourself up for endgame scoring.  The issue is that every card that you can put out to play, be it your general or a building that you've placed has an [b]exception[/b] to the rules.  They're not game-breaking, mind you, but they are certainly fiddly and verbose.  That wouldn't be a problem if the card pool was small, but each player has his own deck and the buildings are split into two decks themselves.  These are all rule-bending in some fashion and by the time the game is over, you're trying to memorize anywhere from 5-12 cards (give or take), all with a lot of text on them telling you how to manipulate the rules to your advantage.

It's this that doesn't make the game bad - it's not bad at all - but it does make the game incredibly lengthy as each player tries to manage the onslaught of information before them, let alone the information before their opponents.  Like I said above, the key to this game is keeping other players in check.  With [i]several[/i] endgame scoring conditions, you're going to have a tough time trying to figure out where to go, nuts to blocking anyone else unless you've got a real good handle on your crud.

So, is the game good?  Yes, it is, but it is rough around the edges and it is extremely expensive for what it is.  Mind you, you are paying for some quality components and the card art is fantastic.

Does it invoke the Three Kingdoms very well?  Naw.  This is what you might call a "heavy" Euro and unfortunately the theme isn't exactly strong with this one.  It's the entire reason I got the game in the first place (love the novels, love the games, might as well have a Koei tattoo on my butt - I don't - and Cao Cao is the best!) but the battles are abstracted to bidding spaces and forget about politics or the endless intrigue of the novel (or the show, if you prefer).  I've yet to see a great game based on this era, which is insanely weird given just how much of a staple it is in Asian countries (this one was designed in the East).  Three Kingdoms ought to be like Cthulhu over there!

Three Kingdoms Redux may yet well be worth your time, but ensure you have a lot of it to spare.  Your first play will likely be 4-5 hours and you'll feel none the wiser for it, but give it enough plays and you'll warm to it.  For that reason, my rating isn't as good as I want it to be.

I’m not much of a wargamer, but I have been known to try out some monster games (The Virgin Queen, Here I Stand). I took that plunge primarily because of insane designs and a historical period I find interesting. But these days, a board game had better be awesome if I’m spending more than three hours playing it. Three Kingdoms covers the Warring States period of China. I know enough about that to recognize which characters appear in the Dynasty Warriors videogame. TKR’s an abstract wargame. You bid for actions in the center using your generals. That lets you build resources, developments, and forces. Eventually you attack regions between you and one of your two opponents. Once you take a region, it starts generating points for you. But you also expend one of your generals doing that and it costs you resources. It’s a cleverly designed balance. Felt fun without being too “chit pushy.”

Excellent asymmetric game that pays homage to other,  substantial euros without being derivative. It gains a 9 for: * Tight thematic integration
* High player interaction
* Beautiful presentation
* High replayability (due to the card drafting)
* Tough decision making (2-3 hours fly by)

It might eventually earn a 10 from me - this just requires more table time.

*Important* Ihis is Christina and Keng's first game to design *and* publish. This is remarkable (and is another reason to draw paralells with Twilight Struggle). Bravo - I hope to see more from this team :)

RATING: 5.5
My special powers were awesome, everybody else's special powers were annoying and broken.  Particularly that bastard who keeps winning ties.

From a more detailed comment elsewhere:

It's just a lot to take in on the first play; by the end I understood how things flowed in general, but the fact that each faction's play aid has 30+ descriptions of the other two factions' special powers on the back is telling -- you need to have a pretty good idea of what your opponents can do outside the normal ruleset to really play effectively.

In games this complex I tend to just ignore a few parts I'm too swamped to deal with. That cost me ten points, depending on how you look at it  I also ended up with a bunch of power cards that didn't match what I was trying to accomplish and I never seemed to have a spare general to bid on card draws.

I guess I'm partial to games that are easier to grasp earlier in your first play; asking somebody to invest 3+ hours just so that they can do much better the next time is great for many folks, it just isn't for me.

For all my whining about the generals getting outbid, I think much of that was before I understood you could always boost a bid by placing another general. The guy who could win ties was pretty fricking irritating though.

Also, I felt that the game was really starting to overstay its welcome (but that's more a reflection on my preferences than any defect in the game) but I think the game was within a turn of ending by at least two of the possible ending conditions (level 5 in the court, and 5 generals out in the battle field at least).

The alliance system where the last two in turn order can sorta work together was neat. I enjoyed the resource management and balancing, although I probably invested too much in the tribal relations track (we all ended with the full four 4vp there, so I'm wondering if I couldn't have spent those generals better elsewhere). I misunderstood how the developments worked as well, so I tended to alternate between flipping a counter and moving it upward when it would have been far more efficient to flip several and then move them up all at once.

Another thing about me is that for many games I come away fairly neutral/negative on them but then I warm up to them over time and like them. I can see playing this again with people already familiar with the game actually; it wouldn't be my first choice but it wouldn't be my last. And for what it's worth, I also plan on playing Kanban again, we definitely made a few rules mistakes.

Fantasticly tight bidding/worker placement game - can see a wealth of depth I'm yet to explore. 

Amazing artwork - think some of the best in any game. Would have preferred wooden components for some of the items (i.e. weapons), but understand why they weren't used.

If you can regularly get 3 players, and you like conflict-heavy euros then GET THIS GAME. Went into my top 10 instantly after playing.

RATING: 10
This is as close as it comes to a perfect 3 player game. The alliance mechanic avoids many of the issues in  3 player games where 2 players can remove each other from contention while the remaining player strolls in for the win. My all time favourite.

10 play check in: This game has improved with every play. There is a constant tension in the game play which you will struggle to find in many other games. The constant underlying flow of player initiative and momentum driven by turn order and bidding potential, kept in check by the need to sacrifice actions for long term political and military position. As I have played more I have also started to see the potential of single separation and unification cards to drive a strategy. In a recent game I deployed a battering ram on the first turn, providing my generals with an extra bid when assigned to battle spaces. I was able to establish an early force on both borders and then use my military advantage to ward off opposing forces for much of the remainder of the game. The way this game developed was completely changes by a single card. I can't wait to explore this game more and look forward to anything that Starting Player release in future. I would rate this higher if I could.

This is a hard game to rate.  The game is clearly a well crafted game, solid and nuanced, and probably exactly what you'd want in a meaty 3 player game.  The primary tension from turn to turn is bidding for actions, with a considerable secondary tension for the special abilities in the game provided by Generals and State Enhancements.  As a practical matter, tracking all the special abilities is quite difficult.  At a glance, the generals look the same, but each is unique, and there isn't much to distinguish them on the rather large board.  There just isn't enough economy in the visual aspects to manage the complexity --you'll need to invest some time and memory to the task.  Honestly, I'm not sure it could be improved, either.  Normally this would be a minor quibble, but given the abilities are game-changing, and the game is roughly 3 hours, it's quite important.  If you don't know exactly what all the generals do and see which is placed where, you will miss important considerations in game play.  That said, most board games with many cards have this to some extent.  If more iconography were on the General tokens, it might be more confusing rather than less.  Production is first rate, and the rules are excellent, especially the compendium that clarifies Generals and their abilities.  The designers have done a first rate job bringing this game to life.

Rating may rise, and some of the subtleties I'm sure I'm missing may start to be appreciated.  We'll see.

Three Kingdoms Redux is an excellent three player game.
I love that each game will be different because of all the generals with special power.
I also love the opaque scoring.
I really love how turn order and the Alliance works.  The player who won the fewest bid, is last and will decide where to place the Alliance token and will be in alliance with the player in second place.
The only downside are that it wont get played often because it only plays three player.  The teaching is long but its not a complicated game (for heavy gamer).  The play time will reduce drastically between the first and second play.
If you have 2 friend with which you can play often, this game will shine.

There are many good things and some less good things.

I think an area control game would be more suited to the Three Kingdoms legend than a victory point game (I'm sick of victory point games anyways). Because it was that in the end, a war for control of the Empire.

With an area control game, you could improve individually provinces (there are like what, 12-13 in China? which would make a small board) with markers of +1 to +4 gold / food improvements. Each province would have its own base income. You would see where the tribes are and where they will strike all the time unless they start invading because the Empire (or the lords of the three kingdoms) does a bad thing at managing its foreign relations. That way, when you develop your farmlands, it would be permanent, also you would not need a general to harvest, that's the job of your peasant and it should be done automatically. Developping markets (which means also industry and manufactures of the region) would also increase taxes each turn. Popular support would not be +1 here and there, but something meaningful like how likely you are to get any peasant revolts for example. And there many other small things like that I don't like.

The turn order thing is a nice thought, and reflects a bit how delicate the situation was in the Three Kingdom legend. The weird thing is that none of these three kingdoms won, it's someone in Cao Cao court (or rather his son's) who takes over the entire realm. lol

I really don't like the competition part in the middle of the board, it makes no sense. If my lord wishes to develop farms in his kindgoms, then he should be able to. That's not how things were done in the story nor is that possible in real life either. Foreign technology and popular support would be on ther other hand quite logical to have competition, much like politicians and diplomats trying to prove that they are the best (or like today, pointing fingers at other parties instead of saying what they are planning to do).

It is a rather simple game to play and understand. Some poeple might be intimidated by the amount of components and things you can do, but it very easy and it's not that big a game in the end. The designers did a good job ar keeping this game simple (too simple for me considering the complexity of the story of the Three Kingdoms plus that voctory point thing... it should have been an area control game in truth).

Looking forward to play a real thorough game even though I will probably never buy this game (too many small unpleasant things for me). But I still give it a 7/10 because it is playable, and you can enjoy it if you have no clue what the three Kingdoms are about or you never read the book.

A very solid and thematic worker placement game with an additional auctioning mechanic where it isn't always enough to be first to lock in an action space.

A very enjoyable theme that matches the mechanics and a fantastic amount of replay thanks to more Generals and cards in the game than can possibly be seen in a single play through.

Euro de col·locació de treballadors amb puja (tipo Ys pero visible) i gestió de recursos. És exclusiu per 3 jugadors. Guanya el jugador amb més PVs al final de la partida. Cada torn, per ordre de joc, cada jugador col·loca un dels seus generals/treballadors a un dels espais d'accions del taulell. Un cop tothom ha passat, cada acció només la fa el jugador que suma més punts amb els generals que ha fet servir. Hi han accions que et proporcionen recursos, uns altres que et proporcionen unitats militars, i unes altres propies de cada jugador que milloren tracks o t'emportes territoris (PVs). A més, cada treballador/general té una habilitat especial que canvia les regles del joc.

Tot i les bones crítiques, no em sembla res del altre mon, la col·locació/puja pot tenir certa gracia però no és res massa original... Les accions son molt "soses" i típiques: agafa 2 recursos d'un tipus, o un i un, etc... Suposo que la gracia del joc deu estar en les habilitats de cada general i com diferencien entre si, però la resta del joc em sembla corrientillo.

Played this 3 times when I got it recently. If you havn't read the Romance of Three Kingdom novel (based on real historical events), it will be very hard to appreciate the intricacies of the game. For those have known Art of War which is really a long proses of what to do and not to do to win war, Romance of Three Kingdom is how Art of War being played out in real life. For majority of American gamers, reading will be a put off (the novel is very thick) and I can see why such a low rating from the western geeks (which rate a numbing and pointless game like Trajan a high 7.6). The card graphics are superbly done, easily one of the best I've seen - probably as good as Viceroy's (I've yet to received that yet). The only issue I have with this game is the box, it is too thin. A thicker box would be better to store everything easily especially the extra free graphic booklet and sleeved cards. Also, should consider some scenario setup, maybe taking out Wu or Shu and played as 2 players.

Having played so many games from famous western European designers, I didn't expect a good one from Asian side (Japan don't count as it is too westernized). This is definitely a promising sign. Too bad this is only exactly for 3 players. Perhaps due to historical context. Maybe, this game can be ported to Warring States which can be played up to 7 players for each states employing the mechanics you have in this game. Probably don't have to be too historically correct - people don't read that much these days.

Really impressed with this game. There are so many things to think about and balance against each other, but when you're playing everything flows together so smoothly. I love the way the alliance bounces around and I think it's really cool to deal with the balancing act of how taking territory loses you the otherwise fixed finite resource you use to take actions. The asymmetry is great too, the way that the different factions have different numbers of generals at different points through the game. And the general powers are all so different and interesting that finding the right ways to put them all to use is great.

RATING: 9
Three Kingdoms Redux is a beautiful game.  As others have alluded to, this includes not just the components and artwork, but also the gameplay mechanics.  As much as I love the Three Kingdoms saga for its stories of heroic battles and political intrigue, an oft overlooked part of the history and era are the economic considerations, and I am glad to see this game as a euro game which uses resource management and decision making as the central mechanism to manage the key elements of war and intrigue.  The breadth of scope is commendable, and the designers managed to interweave military, economy, and politics together in a thematic, yet ludologically compelling manner.

What I like best about the game is that it is:
1.  Thematic.  Anyone who has any familiarity with the history or literature around the Three Kingdoms are instantly drawn to the generals and characters in the game.  The designers have tried to make many of their powers thematic - their stats often reflect their abilities as heroes in battle / military commanders and in governance /  as strategic advisers.  Some of their special abilities also reflect this - for example, Liu Bei can keep one popular support token even after using it, Huang Gai can deceptively take one action and then move to an empty space after everyone has placed, etc.  As a result, even though it is a worker placement game, each worker does feel unique, and you do feel like you are commanding Zhang Fei to hold Chang Ban Po, or asking Guan Yu to focus on recruiting more armies this round.  And even though the mechanism is an auction, the competition between the states for certain spots does feel like a battle of intrigue, whether it be spending resources and political capital to win popular support, or to take hold of the Han Emperor through military power or political persuasion, which, just like in the stories, is important, though not overpowering.  Other very thematic design choices include the three-player only design, the starting positions (in relative power and orientation), and the alliance marker, which provides an advantage but doesn't preclude bidding wars between the two allied powers, and shifts throughout time based on the relative gains made in the prior round.  This theme-laden environment lends itself well to some nice table talk between players during bidding (i.e., "Really??  Are you going to let Cao Cao get away with taking the Emperor again??  Is Wu really going to bend the knee to Wei?").  Wonderful smack talk.

2.  Asymmetrically balanced.  Not only does each side start with their unique contingent of generals, with their varying strengths and unique abilities, they start with different numbers of generals (i.e., actions) and resources.  Following the theme, Wei starts off the strongest, Shu is the weakest.  Yet the game balances because Shu (and Wu to a lesser extent) gains strength faster throughout the game.  The alliance marker also helps provide a benefit to the last two players, which often is Shu because they have fewer generals to start with.  Even without the alliance marker, just simply the nature of having a three player game manages this balance to some extent - the two lagging players may work together to stretch the leader's resources by bidding on actions the leader wants to take.  Finally, there is also balance between different actions - winning militarily give you points, but you have to sacrifice generals and thus future actions, along with have enough economic support.  As a result, those ahead cannot simply just crush the ones behind in a runaway leader situation.

3.  Innovative.  The game's central mechanism is worker placement with locked bidding, which I have not seen before.  Keyflower has worker placement with bidding too, but if you are losing on a hex, you can redeploy your meeples, while in Three Kingdoms Redux, you usually cannot redeploy your generals; hence there is a cost to losing out on bids for actions.  This creates some interesting decisions, especially when deciding whether to one-up another's bid.  For even if you know you can outbid another player, it comes with the opportunity cost, and in a three player game, the two players that overbid will fall behind the third player who stays out of the conflict (though this of course, may be balanced by the fact that the following turn, the two of them will be allied against you).

I also commend the smart design of the game engines.  There are two separate engines - a points engine (military conquest) and an economic engine (rice and gold).  As alluded to earlier, the points engine helps you win the game, but you need to expend generals (thus permanently losing actions), armies / weapons, and economic resources (gold & rice).  Those who expand first militarily often have a lead on points, but may have to harder the rest of the game to manage their upkeep and may often be outbid by their opponents.  Yet focusing purely on an economic engine first may also not be winning because the marketplaces and farms only defray your upkeep costs and do not actually give you resources (unless you sacrifice them completely).  The way harvesting rice and collecting tax works is very interesting, and this mechanism is also new to me.

The downside to the game is that it is heavier and takes at least 2-3 hours (though more like 3-4 hours on our first play), it requires exactly 3 players, and it is difficult to fully appreciate it on the first play (the corollary is that you appreciate it more and more on subsequent plays, making it highly replayable).  There are also a lot of components and abilities to remember (would make for a great app with a system for tracking and reminding you just like Agricola!), and with so many things going on, it could feel fiddly.  Finally, with so many spaces, sometimes the battles don't feel like real battles if only one side places generals there, but I rationalize that as just having minor skirmishes early on.  In the end, as the you go down to the wire, the winning militarily become a lot more crucial and in my plays, the battles then become a lot more spectacular, with all the generals, abilities, and resources being thrown at it.

There is a lot to like in this game - looking forward to playing it again!

Inspired by a very specific period in the Han Dynasty, Three Kingdoms Redux gives the feel of a wargame but fought with auctions instead of battles. Each faction has a unique deck of generals from which players draft at the beginning of the game. Generals have three values - administrative, combat and leadership - and a power that triggers at certain times or under certain conditions. Some auctions are won with administration and some with combat. Each of those values can range from 1-5 for each general. The powers are significant and leveraging them effectively is one of your primary keys to doing well.

The auction structure is very similar to a worker-placement game and I was reminded of Agricola a lot while playing. There are 12 common auction fields, 3 battle auction fields (where you auction against your neighbors on each side) and 3 individual fields that require a general to use, but are non-competitive. The structure of the game is identical to that of a worker-placement game where players assign generals to action spaces, values are compared for contested actions, and then the actions are carried out. Most actions have to do with collecting resources - gold, rice, armies, 4 types of weapons, and popular support. Each player also has a personal hand of two types of "state enhancement" cards that can be played to give one a resource or points advantage (sound familiar?). With the resources players can play cards, gain support of the tribes, or win battles and occupy border regions with armies and generals. When your generals occupy a region it gives you points, but you can no longer use that general for bidding, so it weakens you in other ways. You can draft additional generals at 3 points in the game.

For having a pretty simple structure, there is a lot to think about in this one. There are numerous ways to score and you need to pick your focus areas, but the game gives you time to shift your strategy as needed. Due for a reprint from Capstone Games in 2017, Three Kingdoms Redux is a remarkably innovative and payable twist on the basic Agricola format. While there are clear echos of Agricola here, it feels like a very different game. The Singaporean design duo has yet to publish a second game, but more from this team would be most welcomed!

Wow, there is a really good game in here, just not quite the one that got published.  The generals worker placement/action thing is really nice.  Battles are good, and stationing generals to the frontier works well.  Two big objections and one small.  The small is that the 'draw a card' action should be 'draw X and chose one'.  I don't have a problem with some cards being more powerful than others, but to just have a straight lucky dip is lame.  The first big objection is the all-or-nothing auctions.  The loser of the auction should get some benefit, if only a gold or rice.  The second objection is the silly point-salad scoring at the end.  The military points track should be enough on its own.  The other facets of the game should work together in order to get those points, not be a point-scoring end in themselves.

This is a good game where worker placement is used with recruiting generals and using them to bid for action spaces. Each faction has a good number of generals to choose from and all have asymmetrical powers. You need to balance controlling your resources with stationing troops at border locations while watching your domestic economy. There is really a good game element for choosing an alliance that makes it easier for the 2nd and 3rd player{s} to achieve and play out one action space over the 1st player.

Three Kingdoms Redux is an ancient, Chinese, long haul, and despite some weird trudges through the rulebook, brings richly to life the experience of managing an empire in a time of politically-charged war.

RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Learning game(s) will take longer than the time on the box as one figures out different actions, how to chain them together, and also figure out which generals to draft, etc.  My favorite part of this game are the different generals and their special abilities that play a significant role in the game.  Don't view this as a war game - it is clearly an auction game using the stats on your generals as the auction bids along with a couple other chits that can be included.  You cannot move your generals from a losing bid so you can lose actions which is painful.  If you battle early and station troops, you will score each turn for those troops but you now have one less general available in future turns with which to bid, etc...an interesting catch 22 so to speak.  There are some significant end game scoring majorities that one needs to be aware of as well.  Since one doesn't come close to using every general, each game can and will likely look very different.  Also, each of the three nations start with different stuff/generals. Expect the first game to go around 3-4 hours.  Money and Rice can be hard to come by if one doesn't plan well.  The alliance feature of allying the second and third player on one space is an interesting feature as well.

This is a pleasant brain burner of a game for only three players that's also beautifully illustrated. It's worker placement kicked up a notch. There are so many details to keep track of when planning your turn that it takes a while to optimize your moves. It's just a delicious smorgasbord of options to consider in positioning oneself to do well, especially in competition against neighboring opponents. (Bonus for a box with zero bloat!)

The game of epic proportions retells the Romance of the Three Kingdoms in a new and exciting way. Requiring exactly 3 players, each finds them in control of a state and a group of generals. Jostle for precious resources, make temporary alliances, and wage battles to see which of the Three Kingdoms will earn the Mandate of Heaven.

Having had only one play of this, my comment may not hold much weight, but take it for what you will. For such a compact box, which I greatly appreciate (half the height of most standard square-box games), this is a game that easily holds twice the game. The three-player only limitation and the inherent randomness of card drawing are the only knocks I can muster of Three Kingdoms Redux. It's got a great theme, fantastic artwork, compelling and enthralling gameplay with hard decisions. The player interaction is a wonderful tightrope that very much mimics the era the game is based on.

Didn't expect to like this game as much as I did.  Plenty thematic even though it's a cube pusher.  Really tight design too that kept me on my toes throughout.  Initially it seemed like there were too many options for my taste but the arc of the game is such that you always feel behind the eight-ball.  This feeling isn't difficult for a euro to access but it's dressed up very thematically here.

Exciting, tense and dynamic three player strategy mayhem. Thematically rich with visually compelling components, this game transports you back to the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty. A powerhouse of a game, utilizing worker placement with variable player powers - where your state's officials and generals compete through bidding to accomplish a variety of actions.  These actions abstract and distill the essence of state management and warfare in 3rd century China, where the end goal is to crown your lord Emperor. 

This game, in short time, has shot straight into my Top 5 Games, ever.

Very interesting worker-bidding game. Dividing your resources between private, public, and semi-shared (battle) positions, including temporary and permanent stations, is very high-tension. Fighting on two fronts while keeping the natives happy is the same. The length of this one knocks it down a bit for me, but it's quite enjoyable and I'd definitely give it another go.

RATING: 8
Set in the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, this is a heavily thematic and deeply involved game for 3-players. The game is assymetric, meaning that the players will find themselves with variable strengths and weaknesses that must be managed and played carefully to get the most out of your house. 

The game-play itself is a simple enough mix of worker placement and area majority but the timing required and development of longer term plans require much thought. 

The game play itself is highly rewarding and the player interaction is through the roof in this one. The combination of General Powers, Civil Development Cards and the multitude of locations to consider make for a heady mix of concentration and attention to detail. But the experience is highly rewarding even if it can take between 3 and 4 hours when first learning. 

The highest praise I can give this game is that its weight is well beyond my regular gaming tastes, but I really enjoy this and hope to get many more plays in over the coming years. 

Oh kudos must also go to the Designers and production team for the quality of the production. For a self-published title 3KR looks a million bucks from component quality through to the artwork.

Abstracting 100 years of romanced Chinese history in a most engaging euro with constant player interaction is a ROTK's dream come true! 23 unique officers per clan of which you'll choose 8 to race your state for domination, balancing tributes and trades, shifting alliances, building some of the 42 possible enhancements, thwarting tribal invasion threats and vying for court ranks while being embraced by the stunning art of Ray Toh along the time traveling journey. The experience and tension this game creates has proven to be unmatched after many plays.

A three-player worker-placement game that seeks to emulate the politics (more than the warfare) of the three kingdoms period in Chinese history.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyed my play of this but there are some issues. The fatal flaw is time. Yes, the game can end sooner than 12 turns but if it goes the distance, it will literally be an all day affair. Our game ended at turn 7 and that was the 2 1/2 hour mark.

My other major concern is there is a lot of verbiage on cards to have to sift through, memorize, or constantly refer to. Some cards were rather ambiguous as to their benefit.

One other thing--it would have been nice to know the strengths of the other players' generals that are in front of them and not played yet, as it is important to know this to make an intelligent decision as to where to play your own. It's just not possible to see across the table the numbers on the tokens.

But, with that said, it is a clever, well designed, entertaining, and challenging game. We all had fun with the names of people and places (can you say Shi Ting)

Excellent game. A bit difficult to get exactly 3, but it's one of the best games I've played at that count. The rules are much simpler than they let on, but there are a lot of corner cases. Still, now that I've gotten one play in, I think it'll be much easier to teach/play next time. It definitely rewards repeat plays with the same players though. Learning the ins and outs of a general can really benefit the player.

Three Kingdoms Redux is a very good strategy game with solid player interaction, and interesting tactical decisions during the bidding phase.  The theme comes through in game play through the evocative art and mechanics that force the three kingdoms to work with or against each other based upon current strength and situation.

While technically a bidding game, this game felt like a combination of a bidding game and a worker placement game.  Each General (worker) has a variable value as the players bids for action spaces.  However, two Generals can often be combined to have a bid value that can beat a single opponent General, so it has the flavor of some worker placement games, such as Vanuatu.  

Once a General is placed on an action space, he cannot be moved, so there is a real risk you will lose your General’s valuable potential to take an action if outbid.  Therefore, bidding requires an understanding of what you need, and just as importantly, what your opponents need.  When two players battle intensely for an action space, the third player benefits by having a wide open opportunity for more actions.  The game balances this nicely with the forced temporary alliance of the two players who took the fewest actions the previous turn.  If they work together, the two players in the alliance can help themselves while directly denying one important action to the third player.  But a forced alliance can be fragile, so opportunities for betrayals and negotiated moves are available in the game if the players want, but can be avoided easily if that style of play does not suit the players.  

As for potential downsides, our first play took four hours to reach nine turns before an end condition was met.  Potentially, a five hour game was there, if the full 12 turns cap was reached.  Play time should improve with experienced players, but with the variable end conditions it seems hard to predict how long a game will take, within a two to five hour range.  Another issue is game complexity.  Once the rules are known, understanding how opponents’ Generals work is critical to a player’s success, because if those skills are not countered or mitigated by the other players many Generals have skills that can be exploited to game-changing advantage.   Countering the skills of the opponents’ Generals was difficult while learning the game.  Also, the variable skills of the many Generals adds time to the game, both during the General selection phase and applying the General’s effects.  Finding available time to play, having exactly three players, and seeking players of somewhat comparable experience are all important to getting this game to the table.

The production value of this game is excellent.  The artwork, attention to design, and component quality are impressive for a new, independently produced game.  This game seems to have much to uncover in future plays, so I look forward to playing it again.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent game. My favourite this year and probably best since Terra Mystica a few years ago.

I also happen to be a fan of Agricola, which the designers admit heavily influenced this design. Of course, what really hit the spot for me and got me excited is the theme. I love the three kingdoms story from my time playing the first Dynasty kingdoms when I was 13 on the original nintendo. I was shocked at how the names of most of the characters came back to me.

It's nice to see a game that is designed around a theme that works as well as this. It is not only a solid Euro but with a great theme to boot. First game I can think of where your workers are actually assymetric and come with their own special abilities which I really enjoy.

Other pluses are the fact that it is a 3 player game, not many are designed strictly for 3. Each kingdom plays differently because of its unique generals. Scoring is always tight so every action matters and decisions are agonizing. Even playing the same kingdom back to back is a different experience because your general draw for a game will determine your strategy going into it.

I've played 8 times I think in a month and a half and can't get enough. Time investment is longer than usual, but I'm engaged the whole time so have no regrets. My gaming group like it so much we each bought our own copy and are importing it directly from the designers. Well done!


UPDATED Feb 2017 - played my 20th game. K still dominates in wins so far. I dropped the rating to 8.5 because on occasion Wei can just be stupid overpowered. Today K got an unbeatable combo. I think that is partly why I had such a miserable game as Wu since I felt the game was over before we even started

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
There's a lot of theme and a lot of game in this! Based on the story of the three kingdoms, each player represents one kingdom with it's own unique set of generals and also a slightly asymmetric start to the game (based on history) which I loved. There's worker placement, auctioning, resource management and a lot more going on at the same time. Tons of unique abilities may make things a bit confusing, especially when you sometimes need to keep track of generals of other kingdoms, then it's too much. But maybe with more plays, and more familiarity with the game it could get easier for me to remember. 
The only one downside is that the game thematically/logically expects for the 2 weak kingdoms to join hands against the strong kingdom, and if that doesn't happen then there's little one player can do. But that should not be a problem when playing with reasonably experienced gamers.

Just purchased this and received it a week ago. Temporary rating of 7 until I can get it to the table, based on how much I like the theme and limited solo game play testing I've done. I love the history of the Three Kingdoms era, and this looks like a great heavier game to play.

*Edit*  - Taught the game to three friends and helped them with strategy through out the first game. Good mix of theme with a bidding mechanic and changing strategies each time you play. Great game.

The game seems sound, and I don't mind its cut-throat gameplay, worker placement style, or theme, but I find it hard to juggle a myriad of special abilities and deal with more extensive card text than I like in a Euro-style game (though this is not as bad as in more Ameri-trashy games). Its length (up to 12 repetitive rounds) was also an issue for me.

It has a good ebb and flow with some timing decisions and different ways to approach the points struggle. The generals with their wonderfully diverse actions and abilities are also unfortunately the bit that slows the game down. I like it, but you'd have to play with quick or experienced players for it to come in at under three hours. Certainly it's a very rich experience and one I'd like to explore further. Rules are simple and everything has been well thought out (with the exception of a few graphic design choices that need further refining, such as the trained and untrained ducks... um... army counters). Certainly it's a lot to take in, but as you become familiar with the special abilities of your generals through the game I think the pace surprisingly picks up a bit after about round six.

I really like how you have to select a nice balance of generals here. Not just in special abilities that complement your game plan or special cards, but also a balance with military levels or administrative levels, then also recognising which you'll be shuffling off to the borders and which weapon types will suit picking up an extra VP there.

The art to playing well here is manipulating your turn order and not committing too many generals to battles relative to your opponents. So turn order, the right general selection and the selection order is key.

Fun, but a bit fiddly. With so many special abilities you have to be quite procedural about collecting and paying everything due. Rules are easy enough. Would like to play regularly if we can pick up the pace a bit.

This game has a lot of depth, and because of the randomness of how the cards come out every game will play out differently. This is a gamer's game because of how heavy and strategic it is. You'll get overwhelmed by how much you need to manage and memorize. After my first play through, I can see how much effort the developers put into this game.

Very interesting game. I'm a fan of three-player specific games and heavier historically thematic games (Like Wallace's God's Playground and After The Flood), so this is right up my alley. Quite a lot to take in, and I will really need another play or two.  But I spent the rest of the game day thinking about when we would get the numbers and time available right to play this again.

It's a heavy box with a lot of cardboard and there seems to be a lot going on, but it's really all about bidding. Players use their generals to compete for action spaces. Each player has a deck of generals to recruit from, each general has three stats and unique abilities. With different generals each game and each faction starting with different resources, replayability shouldn't be an issue. The theme of three competing kingdoms is appealing and well integrated throughout.

The additional booklet available from the publisher gives background for the generals and is a good historical intro. The odd thing is that it won't quite fit in the box.

It's an odd beast.  3-player only, worker-placement that plays nothing like other worker-placements.  Gorgeous artwork, thematically superb.  Really gives a sense of the push and pull of a three-way competition.  

I quite like it after one play.  Full of tense decisions.  I don't know how often it will hit the table, though, because of its strict player-count and length.

Thought this one was ok. Not a big fan of worker placement but it was nice to be able to bid for spaces so you aren't necessarily locked out of that one thing you desperately need.

Just bought, waiting chance to play it at the club, though 3-player games are difficult to schedule in our group.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Initial impressions: essentially a worker placement game with majority scoring for advancements on various tracks (most shared). It's simpler than it seems, and only really worth looking at for its variable player powers.

Each of the three warring kingdoms have a separate pool of 20-odd generals, used to "bid" in the auction phase, each with different stats in the two key bidding currencies and, crucially, a special ability. Some generals grant free stuff, some give bonuses when taking certain actions, others provide amazing passive benefits.

The reason I refer to it as a worker placement game rather than an auction game is that there are so many available action spaces that bids are very often uncontested. The key driver for play is that each player has two borders, one with each other player, consisting of a "battle" auction space and five border locations. Winning the battle allows a general to be permanently stationed there with troops -- the general can no longer be used to bid, but each troop earns 1VP per turn. Each troop also requires an upkeep of 1 gold and 1 rice, with a large penalty for any missed payments, requiring a permanent income stream elsewhere. Players are unlikely to ever have more than 6 (and often fewer than 5) generals available to bid with, so bidding wars are very costly.

It's a clever system and its moving parts work quite nicely; the thematic trappings are engaging. I do have some doubts, though, primarily because of the cards. State enhancement cards -- constructed for in-game bonuses and end-game VP -- are particularly frustrating as they are frequently unusable. If you draw a card and it is literally impossible for you to meet the condition -- e.g. "domestic development of at most 4" late in the game -- then too bad, so sad, sorry you wasted your time. Similarly, it's tough to argue that the generals are all balanced, and they certainly don't have the same usefulness in all situations. Drawing the right one(s) at the right time is a big advantage over opponents not so lucky.

The auctions also do make it problematic to plan or to play efficiently unless you are last to place. Turn order can be manipulated but only with some difficulty. The lack of compensation for losing bids does make it possible for a player to get stomped. It's probably intended to be a "self-balancing" catch-up (read: gang-up) but it's also possible for a player to effectively become collateral damage if outbidding them comes at no cost.

There's a lot to like, particularly the interesting texture provided by the generals, but the totality is more like a glorious mess than a perfectly oiled machine.

Really enjoyed my first 3 plays of this game...and would like to play again, which is something I don't say about many Euros. 

There are three really good things about this game IMO.  First, I like the bidding/competitive tension which makes the (rather tired) worker placement dynamic into something else entirely.  The considerations of which generals are available/deployed and what their powers are, what the bid order will be next round and what I would like it to be, and what I need to accomplish or would like to accomplish for the turn make the general placement very involved and interesting compared to a game like Caverna.

Second, I like how difficult the economic element of the game is to unpack.  Usually you want to just maximize workers in a worker placement game.  But in this game, one of the big paths to scoring VPs (indeed, the one the game practically points you in the direction of) is sacrificing actions for VPs.  How that dynamic works, along with how the provision of rice and gold to support armies interacts with the end-game planning and how to position yourself in the various 1st/2nd/3rd competitions for VPs, is non-trivial and highly variable game to game.

Third, for a close-to-perfect information game, the game succeeds in being surprisingly difficult at any point in time to point out a winner/front runner due to the sheer number of various elements that must be compared and tabulated at the end of the game.  As opposed to games like Caverna (sorry to pick on Caverna, but it's the most recent similar Euro I've played!) where you can kind of scan an opposing tableau and get a sense of VPs, here almost all VP scoring is dynamic and based on comparison of various items across players.  So at least for me (and at least for now--this may fade as I get more experienced), it lends a satisfying air of uncertainty to the proceedings and prevents too much "bashing the leader" as the late game develops.

RATING: 6.25
Some interesting decisions and a very cut throat and brutal game. The problem I have with it is that the asymmetrical nature can be really annoying without experienced players. Additionally, the game feels like it starts off way too slow getting resources and would be better if it focused more on the push and pull of battles. Instead battles seem to either go uncontested or all out -- which seems a bit weird to me. Still has some neat ideas and if you like the theme it would definitely boost the game, but it is overall a bit clunky for my tastes.

Initial rating - need more plays before full review, but I think my rating may actually increase!!?!

*After more plays, this game achieves the highest rating.  It's an absolute masterpiece.  After multiple plays, my opinion changed from best 3-player game to top 5 games of all time to #1 overall (and then to #2 after a dozen or so plays of Gaia Project).  I believe this is the (second) best game I've ever played, and I expect more plays will only cement that opinion.  It is as close to perfection as any game I've ever experienced.  It's the type of game that made me reevaluate all of my other game ratings.

What makes it so good?  Review to follow.

Few games deliver their theme so elegantly as Three Kingdoms Redux. Every aspect of the game conveys the theme of managing your state as it vies for supremacy, and the mechanics blend with the theme perfectly. Each decision is important, and how best to use each of your generals - and when to retire them to maintain your borders - creates some remarkable gameplay.

The gameplay is tight, and while the initial learning curve may [i]seem[/i] complex, by the second turn of the game it's refreshingly simple to comprehend. The asymmetrical play, as well as the wide variety of available generals, keeps this game fresh and engaging. A perfect heavy game for three players.

This was very difficult to get, but worth the effort.  It's nice to have a game that plays three, since we often play 3.  I know that's a downside for a lot of people, but it works for us.  My only big con is I wish the components were a little easier to use -- some of the Generals' names are virtually identical and it's impossible to distinguish some of the upgrades from their base tokens.

RATING: 7
A thematic three-player only bidding worker placement games. Not your average euro for sure! Variable player powers not only because of the difference in starting positions but also because you three times in the game draft new generals from your private pool. These generals all have a special ability when used for something specific and often combo with others. They have a power rating for war and one for administration. These ratings are how you use them to bid for the 12 different actions on the board or for going to war against your neighbours. That is a great idea that adds player interaction to the game. What's an even better idea is that the player who won the most actions in the former round is automatically set against the two other players in the next as they are then in an alliance with each other for one round. The rules are well written and it's not mechanically heavy but there is definitely some depth to the decision space.

RATING: 9.5
I am one of the designers of Three Kingdoms Redux and am giving a rating of 9.5 for my board game.

I enjoy board games that are highly replayable with a lot of player interaction. My favourite board game is Agricola (with Farmers of the Moor), which I rated 10. This is followed by Hive at 9.5 and Glen More at 9.2. Based on my gaming experience, I feel that Three Kingdoms Redux fits in at around 9.5. I feel it has a higher replayability than Glen More. Besides replayability, Agricola scales across a larger range of players than our game and therefore deserves the rating of 10. I love Hive for its limitless possibilities, achieved with so few game components.

What I like about Three Kingdoms Redux:
•	Historical Theme: The theme in the game reflects the major events of the Three Kingdoms era. I especially like the Han emperor, relationships with border tribes, winning popular support of the people and alliance formation parts of the game.
•	Replayability: Asymmetrical starting positions mean that playing different states give a different experience. Randomness is introduced via recruitment of generals and the initial hand of state enhancement cards. Players can form their own strategies to suit their hand of cards. 
•	Player interaction: There is a lot of player interaction during the game as players try to outbid one another for the common actions. There is often negotiation between the players, which enhances the flavour of the game. Such interaction did not end with the game; Some of our playtesters continued to discuss the game after it ended. As the designer, I enjoy listening to the conversation regarding the strategies that they adopted during the game. 
•	Number of players: A 3-players game is especially suitable for the theme. It is an intricate balance of power among the players that can change along the game. That makes the game especially interesting as players try to figure out that balance. 
•	Multiple paths to victory: There is no fixed way of winning the game. Player can adopt different paths to victory depending on their generals and enhancement cards. 
•	Continued engagement: The scores of all categories are not being tracked throughout the game. It may therefore not be clear as to who is leading or losing until the final year of the game. Players are engaged and kept in suspense until the end of the game. 
•	Artwork: The game comes with excellent artwork by a talented local artist, Ray Toh. There is a story depicted behind each piece of artwork. 

Possible reasons why boardgamers may not like our game:
•	Number of players: It is a 3-player game. I am aware that a lot of BGG-ers play games with their Significant Other and a game that scales across different numbers of players will be viewed more favourably.
•	Complexity: Three Kingdoms Redux is a complex euro game and players who prefer simpler game may not enjoy it.
•	Playtime: The playtime is usually around 2.5 hours for relatively experienced players. This may be a turn off for board gamers who prefer shorter playtimes.
•	Learning curve: This game has a reasonable learning curve, and an experienced player will enjoy some advantage over a new player. Experienced players know the general and state enhancement cards better and can take these into account during the game play. 
•	Gameplay experience: This depends on how the players play the game. Some may play it in a very cut-throat manner and there are boardgamers who dislike such overly cut-throat games.

Increased to a 9 after a full play. A rich and absorbing experience that will probably be a classic. At 3 players (only) and 3-4 hours of playing time it will be hard to get to the table as much as I'd like and it deserves.

Christina Ng Zhen Wei and Yeo Keng Leong have made a solid well-tuned design and provide an unbelievable amount of support for it. If you can arrange the logistics (3 players,  3 hours)  this is game that should be in every hardcore gamer's collection

Preliminary rating based on a first incomplete play. More of a war management game than an actual wargame, this three player only game is a clever amalgam of worker placement, auction and logistics game. Winning battles can become unexpectedly expensive, players may prefer a political or developmental strategy rather than a military one. Despite the compact box, there's a lot of game in there and I look forward to my next play.

Wow. What a spectacular resource management game. Dripping with theme that brings back to my younger years playing Romance and Dynasty Warriors. You don't need to know the lore to enjoy this game but it helps. The game has a lot of moving parts but plays very smoothly once it gets going. Each army feels different yet balanced. So many generals that the game never feels the same. I was expecting an Ameritrash war game and was blown away by a Euro game. This just went right near the top of my wishlist and I'm looking forward to the reprint here in 2017. Buy this game if you can find it. Be

I feared this game would be too complex or too heavy too teach, as the pictures and various reviews all seemed to indicate it would be. I took a chance on it though and am so very glad I did. Gameplay is smooth, the rules are fairly simple even...but the decision trees are huge. The three houses each have their own unique deck of generals that enter into the game slowly over the course of play. All are unique with different skills, powers and areas of expertise. This brings an almost CCG type gameplay to the mix and also allows every session to be completely unique, as you will only see a portion of the available generals on any given play. Of course, even after you see them you have to decide when to keep them around to work and fight and when to give them a governership of one of your conquests, which is necessary to hold the territory (which is necessary to win the game, of course)...but also removes that general from play.

The rest of the game is three way tug-of-war. Anytime one side gains an advantage, the other two sides are automatically aligned and allied to resist them, through the game's brilliant auction system, which is almost more of an area control game than an auction proper. 

It's hard to get, expensive and difficult to get to the table due to the strict 'three player only' restriction. It's absolutely worth the trouble to get a play in however, if you can manage it. As is one of the most unique strategy games I have ever played, I can't recommend it enough.

Heavyweight Weuro.  Asymmetric powers and gaming for three players only (no more, no less, two shall not be used lest it be followed by three. Five is right out.) which may take the right time and players to get it to the table. Still, a solid game with good mechanics that will reward multiple play so you can better know the character abilities.

RATING: 9.6
I am one of the designers of Three Kingdoms Redux. 

My rating of 9.6 reflects how I feel about my board game, compared with my playing experience of other board games. My favourite board games are Agricola (with Farmers of the Moor) and Hive, rated 10 and 9.75 respectively. Up till now, they are the only two board games that I enjoy more than Three Kingdoms Redux. It is always tempting to rate my own game 10 and I resisted doing so. My rating is therefore a reflection of my game experiences.

What I enjoy about Three Kingdoms Redux:
•	Strong historical theme: The various aspects of running a state in ancient China, the famous Three Kingdoms generals and the inventions and constructions of that era
•	Game mechanics that complements the theme: The alliance, Han emperor and tribal relations mechanics stand out in particular
•	A lot of player interaction: Direct (negotiation) and indirect (bidding and blocking)
•	High replayability and sufficient depth: It still throws up new and unexpected experiences after 150 playtests
•	Reasonably short setup time: Below 5 minutes
•	Very attractive artwork: By the very talented Ray Toh

Flaws:
•	Theme: The trading of weapons feels a little off-theme, but it was included as an alternative way for players to gain gold and rice
•	Playtime: Between 2.25 to 2.75 hours for players who know the rules, and approximately 3 hours for first-timers, which may turn off board gamers who prefer shorter playtimes
•	Put-back time: There are quite a number of components to keep after the game, and this may take more than 5 minutes to accomplish

At the time of writing this, I have over 650 and 350 plays of Agricola (with Farmers of the Moor) and Hive respectively. Three Kingdoms Redux comes in as my third most played board game, at around 200 playtests and other casual plays (August 2014), and still counting. I do not rate board games until I have at least 5-10 plays of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A pleasant worker placement. The upgrade cards and generals make the game. The catch up mechanic with the alliance is simple but quite effective. 

The game doesn't shines anywhere in particular (except the generals), but it has almost no flaws.

Biggest negative - time consuming for a 3 player worker placement game

I also love the theme.

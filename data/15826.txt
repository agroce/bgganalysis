So much CHAOS! 
There is a lot of rulebook checking involved, the most I've ever encountered in a game. 
There are also so many things to consider that a single card play can take quite a long time.
These combine make it ideal for PBEM play.

RATING: 9
Easily the best CDG I've played.  The rules are very fiddly so the game requires a big commitment before you'll feel confident.  Don't expect to remember all the fiddly bits and pieces even after your 3rd game.  Unfortunately, one seemingly insignificant sentence somewhere in one of the two rulebooks can turn out to be a total game breaker.  For this reason I don't recommend ToC for anything but regular and committed play.  And for you people complaining about complexity, squirt me a tear!  It's a CDG for real grogs!

RATING: 5.9
Very detailed game, with a lot of research behind, no doubt. A LOT OF CHROME.

Does it work well? Yes and no. Yes because it seems to propose a very immersive and well rounded history experience. No beacuse as a game, it is simply too much, too long.

This can't be played properly under 12 or more hours of non-stop play. It is impossible to play the 16 turns in 6 hours, no way. It is also very unlikely that rules mistakes and oversight will happen.

It is also very hard to grasp all the interplay/pre-reqs of the ACs and Factions in play. The Political game and the management of the Factions is very challenging.

I'm not 100% convinced that the PoG engine is well adapted to this wild and woolly situation.

Not sure this will make it on my table again.

Oh my god...this game is complex...wow! And playing it is hard too. I found the rules to be vague and without the help of the player-aids available here... I would have been lost. BUT ITS FUN!!! I can't explain it... Having factions come onto your side and then leave! Having your supply lines cut! Having the in-fighting disable your side! Having Green units stab you in the back! Me and my friend has been playing this weekly and I currently have no interest in playing anything else...we even suck at it... we haven't once got to the 1919 cards before one of us frack up and end the game :):) Very hard game to master and learn... but IT'S WORTH IT!!!!! Would give it a 9 if the rules were clearier.

RATING: 7
I can't say I'm an expert as we only made it through set-up and one turn of the tournament scenario.  I have to say all the critiques are true.  There is too much chrome, too many fiddly special rules that if you miss can break your game, and two rule books which don't do a good job of telling you how to play so that you don't screw something important up.  

All that said, I was fascinated by what I did experience.  There is so much character and theme dripping from the map and pieces.  Every facet of the historical event is represented in some way.  The truly chaotic nature of the struggle is palpable thanks to the design.  I also think the game is gorgeous all set up.  It probably helps that I am fascinated with the historical subject.  

As for the game mechanics, I felt that the basic movement and combat systems were intuitive and fun.  I felt that the CDG aspect was easy to understand having played Hannibal vs. Rome.  I enjoyed the political phase although I can see how the process is a bit opaque and might be confusing or disappointing. 

In sum, this is a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless.

Paths of Glory meets Days of Decision. A Pog spinoff much more complex due to faction rules and the author goal to insert as much chrome as possible.
The game is tough, but beautiful.
Player aids are missing, but can be downloaded from the web.
If you are not a grognard stay away. Otherwise you have a very nice wargame to be played.

Really love the game. The Political game is awesome. The board, the units movement and fight.... 

It is not a 10 due to all the rules and exceptions.

--------------------------------------------------------
At the third attempt to play this game I think we spent more time playing the game than checking the rules.

Its very hard to rate this game. The experience is great, no doubt, but the slow pace of the game and constant rules checking, counter finding, etc... is just annoying.

For now I will rate it an 8. As the experience increases if the pace of the game improves the rate will go up. If we find that it is impossible to play it faster, I will change it to a 7.

RATING: 5
Update: I've had to further degrade my rating due to a) raw unplayability and b) victory conditions that appear highly questionable. This is undoubtedly the most disappointing game in recent memory, not because it's awful, but because I am pretty sure there is an absolutely killer game in there, if only the designer had been able to take a hatchet to the complexity. But as it is, the game is a dictionary definition of "overwrought".

Update: Having made it through a full(ish) game, I knocked my rating down. I do like Triumph of Chaos, and think it's an interesting game. But at the end of the day, it's just very complicated, very long, and very fiddly, and so hard to play. Now, Paths of Glory seemed pretty fiddly when I first played it, so it's hard to say with these things; but Triumph of Chaos is a Paths of Glory plus a lot of stuff,  so there's no question it's got potential complexity issues. This combined with the play time, which appears to be significantly longer than Paths of Glory, presents a problem for me. Both of us wished that 20% could have been cut off the top of the complexity. Also, the political rules seemed to be a bit too abstract, and a lot of fiddly work for a pretty low payoff.There is also the question of the situation and victory conditions. Like in Ted Racier's Reds!, the Reds are basically trying to clean up the map. Historically fine, but I'm not sure it's particularly entertaining for the Whites in the end. I actually wonder if the VCs are at all balanced; there was absolutely no way the Whites were holding out in our game, and it was hard to point to serious errors that would have resulted in such a blow-out (the Whites got behind on victory cities - as seems inevitable - and once the VP level hits 30, the Reds only have to go East, and don't have to deal with the tough Poles or Balts at all). Again, it's hard to judge these things with certainty based on one play, so bear that in mind. But we found that like Reds!, the game lacked tension in the middle period. The opening was cool, the end-ish game was cool (or would have been anyway if the Poles had turned out to matter at all), but the middle was flat.
---
Played once. Well, half a game, really. So far I like it. The complexity is a bit on the heavy side, but given the fact that the core is so similar to Paths of Glory, it's not as painful as it would be in an all-new game. I like the either/or then remove events which make for some interesting choices. The core system also feels more natural here than it did even in Paths of Glory. Need to play more. Quite optimistic, pending more play.

RATING: 8.5
Definitely the best game of the year for me (2005). The game is a mechanical clone of POG, down to the fact that it compels you to know more about an important but not so known war  (Russian Civil War).
The huge amount of chrome slow things down a bit, but the game go on quite nicely and time seems to fly.
I feel the political phase, which is very important, takes too much time for too wild effects, should and could have been different. But it doesn't matter too much since you have a lot of fun anyway.
Map and counters are nice but you cannot tell the formers from the latter when the set-up is done and even after more than 15 hours of playing things are not easy to discern. 
The absence of player aids in a game that sports 42 tables is quite unsatisfactory and even more unsatisfactory is the absence of an aid where put ALL the counters down in order to find them when needed during play. 
This is a game for the enthusiast expert gamer or for the enthusiast collector, I don't think it will see much play since the learning curve is VERY steep and high (not so high on mechanics if you already know path of glory), but a very satisfactory game waits for the few that will make the journey. Recomended.

I lowered my vote when I discovered that this game needs a commitment that only ASL deserve. All the chrome it contains it's the reason why I've played just thrice after the ToC feast of 2005.

RATING: 7
Rating after three plays. This game takes the Paths of Glory system and uses it to good effect for the Russian Civil War. The political factions, and the attempt to gain control of them, are a neat idea. The secret chit draw that each side must make each turn adds an element of tension without being too chaotic, so that's nice. The leader and unit restrictions are also a nice add-on.

Unlike other folks, I have no problem with the "chrome" for this game. However, this game has some issues that forced me to drop my rating to a 7. First and foremost, it does not appear that the Whites can actually win short of getting Germany into the war. I've heard that this has been addressed in a more recent version of the rules, but I haven't checked. Second, the Polish entry rules confused the heck out of us - I can't remember why now, it's been a while - but it I do remember that it seemed pointless to try to bring them into the war. Third, the political mechanic, which seemed neat at first,  ultimately felt completely chaotic. In one game, for example, Germany entered the war on my side even though I made absolutely no effort to bring them in. In the next game, despite trying my hardest, I could not bring Germany into the war. By the third game, attempts to influence political factions had become a bit of a sideshow for us, and we both felt it was too time consuming.

All that being said I still like this game and, if there is indeed a rules update, I'll have to give it a try again.

Update: The rulebook does seem to have ballooned since I played. Combined with the essentially mandatory playbook, it's now close to 70 pages! I think we were skipping over stuff when I originally played, and there weren't any living rules that added more chrome, so take my comments about the chrome not bothering me with a grain of salt. I don't think I would put up with this game today.

A stunning map with beautiful counters and the cards. As history goes this is the most detailed accounting of the Russian Civil War ever done in gaming.

Ridiculously overpriced boardgame. Saw on sale in UK for over 60 UKP. I wouldn't even pay that for a nicely done computer version with an intelligent AI opponent for single play (all the pretty chrome included and amplified).

Triumph of Chaos had been sitting on my shelf for too long and I finally had the chance to see it in action.  On the surface this is a beautiful game with very high production value on the components.  The rulebook is a nightmare to get through and on my first session, we took a good 4 hours to get the setup and a few turns done.  However, we both felt we wanted to put the extra effort and try it again.  This isn't in the same league as other successful CDG's but there is much to discover here.

Way too much chrome. I'm not against complexity when it is called for, but at some level it just drains the fun out of a game. Now I'm far from an expert on the Russian Civil War, but what exactly did the 18 minor factions (besides the Reds and the Whites) represented in this game actually do? 

   Well, they helped supply their allies, they defended their home territory against all comers and they occasionally went on ill-advised adventures. So, to a gamer that might sound like 2 rules and a bunch of special event cards. But no, in this game it involves pages and pages of faction specific rules, modifiers, special rules, charts, cards, leaders, chits, markers, prerequisites, exceptions to the special rules, optional rules, some more charts and a sub-system or two. At some point, it's enough. 

Chaos truly did triumph in this game.

Interesting game.  The rules are clear and well-organized (especially as compared to most other card-driven games).  The separate supplement was a good idea, putting all of the faction rules in a separate place. The map is beautiful, and the counters are attractive.  My only quibbles: the cards are narrow so there's little margin around the text and pictures, and there are quite a few typographical errors on the cards and in the rules.  The game could also benefit from a thorough chart showing event cards with their prerequisites and mutual exclusions.  The factions and the political phase add a lot to the game and really set this apart from other card-driven games, but the political phase is a lot of work -- can't help but wonder if this couldn't have been streamlined somehow.

Also see review.

I can't help it.  I am completely insane.  I really enjoy this game.  I'm not sure I would recommend it to almost anybody, but I do love it.  If you are the type of person who would enjoy this game, you already know who you are.  That said...

This game is a hugely overchromed nightmare with many little bullet rules that are not systematic--make absolutely sure you print out the newest living rules as it has many balance fixes (often additional little rules, argh!).  It's a bit hard to play with all those rules.  Card play sequence/memorization is also critically important for strategy.  I'm still not totally convinced leaders are that important an introduction besides as, admittedly wonderful, flavor and theme.  The game is chaotic in some ways--you never know if, even when you spend all your big cards on the political phase, you will reap any of the rewards you expect if the additional random cards come out the wrong way and your opponent also invests heavily.  Something completely unexpected could happen instead.  Don't take this to mean the game has no skill--a new player such as myself will be completely dismantled by a good player.

Nevertheless I can't help but fall in love with the game.  The multitude of factions and huge swings in fortune are thrilling.  The flavor of all the different troops and the desperate attempts to bring in new forces in areas you feel outnumbered through the political system is brilliant.  Though complex, the political cards system is one of the best additions to the CDG genre of all time.  We've learned that wargames can now actually include politics--we knew that they could when playing POG but they were included only in a very deterministic way.  Now we see with this game that wargames can also dynamically handle politics and a political process as a part of the game.  I look forward to seeing this system picked up somewhere else and hopefully refined.  I would *love* to see a game where there is a political phase, like this game's, that simulates both sides' internal politics and puts constraints on your ability to fight the war you will be conducting in the action phase.

I haven't played this enough to really pinpoint my rating.  I'm putting 8 right now.  I need to find out if there really are the bewildering amount of play styles and options that there seem to be or if there are only actually a couple "good" ways to play the game.  It would be disappointing to see this game, which is so based on choice, straitjacketed by a few ways that are actually successful.

The production itself is a strange mix of outstanding and poor.  Specifically, counters have great art and the map is beautiful.  The cards are graphically fairly well made.  But there are also other issues--the rulebook is a bit of organizational mess and the cards and stock themselves are not very nice.  I also had trouble getting some of the counters out, so some of my counters are a little damaged.

Update Sept 08
Moving it up to 8.5.  Once you come to grips with this ugly beast, it is an extremely variable and satisfying game.  May continue to rise and I will definitely preorder Triumph of Fascism.

Rating keeps bouncing around the 8 level depending on my whims.  An excellent game though.

December 09

It's just so much work!  I need to play this again sometime but my rating is moving down simply because of how much work it is, not because the game isn't fun and good.  I rate on the BGG "am I up to play it" scale.

One of my favourites. Played it countless times and I have to say that white, played well, can be a tough nut to crack. Maybe even to much. Most of the times winning is related to getting control of Ukraine. Given the complexity of the possible developments of the game, sometimes rules need to be interpreted or even created. Overall this is a worthwhile price to be paid for a very colourful game.

It's really not that bad.  Neither is it really that hard.  For me...it just didn't click at all.  I loved the theme, and the amount of chrome was fine, but the problem was, I kept screwing little things up.  Somethings which are very similar in other CDGs are quite different here.  It's more like PoG than Hannibal, or HIS, but it's still quite a bit different.  I'd probably love this game if I hadn't already played so many other CDGs which are all a little bit more similar in style.

Still would love to try f-t-f, but short of that...no

RATING: 4
Lots of interesting stuff going on for the players, tons of historical detail, a game you might love to look at and long to play, but probably won't...

The amount of chrome is excessively high for me.  I tend to like a lot of flair in a game, but at this level it makes the game near-impossible to teach - both players need to be committed enough to read the rule book and play several games just to see how things work.  Note that each of these learning games is about 12 hours.  There is a tournament game, but I question how much you can learn the full system of the game when late war consequences are ignored.

Obviously, the designer and CoA put a lot of effort into this game.  The artwork and components are very nice.

After another attempt at playing it, I counted up what I would consider chrome rules.  I hit 71, and that isn't including optional rules or the add-on Comrade's Guide rules.  I also didn't include the political card rules, the leader rules, or the in-fighting rules, which would be chrome with PoG as a baseline, but are kind of core rules with ToC.

So, 71 chrome rules, or roughly one per page of the 69 pages of rules (note that the "supplement" is really "rule book, part deux", it isn't a playbook like in some other games).  Some are a sentence, but others are much more involved (e.g. 8.321 for Poland is 4 pages).  I think this also misses some card clarifications that are in the rulebook, but not on the card itself, making you unsure when you play a card that you aren't missing some wrinkle.  I believe I also found a special rule about Czech Legion control of victory point cities that is only on the Faction Control Chart, and not in the rules anywhere.  

At 69 pages, this is longer than WiF (61 pages), and these are harder rules to deal with since WiF primarily deals with core rules that you use every turn (e.g. naval rules, air rules, production), while about 10-15 pages of ToC are core rules (i.e. PoG), and everything else is chrome and/or unique stuff that isn't used all the time and is very hard to remember.

I found it too difficult to sort all this stuff out enough to make meaningful decisions about what action card events to play.  I also found the whole political card and faction alignment system far too random and time-consuming - even when playing both sides solitaire, the outcome of the political phase was basically unpredictable, yet very decisive in some cases (e.g. Ukraine joins the Reds at the first chance for the Central Powers to exit stage right).

In the games I played both solitaire and F2F, you end up taking actions that are poorly understood to keep the game moving along, only to find out later you "chose poorly".  I could see that if you really understood the complex map, card interactions, chrome rules, etc. that this could be a sublime experience.  But, I don't know anyone that is interested in playing a single complex and long game to that level anymore.  There are a ton of deep, historically accurate games out there that manage to get by with 30 or less pages of rules.

I'll avoid an editorial on whether or not the design should have been done this way and and just say it is too much for me.  For the Russian Civil War, I will have to stick with Reds! and know that many things of historical interest are 'swept under the rug' in the interests of a simpler rulebook and shorter playing time.

RATING: 9
Very impressed by this game! Good rules, beautiful counters and a subject absolutely dripping with atmosphere. I really like how the game can just get out of whack real quickly, the unstable situation both sides of this conflict faced is conveyed very nicely. The love and effort of the designer are clearly visible. And you can save the poor czar (or at least try)!

Also, love the political phase, though I can see that some traditional minded wargamers may not be overly enthusiastic about it since it can very well be a game winner if the other side makes some bad moves or bluffs.

Be warned though, the learning curve can be steep because of all the fiddly faction rules. Also the rulebook isn´t the best in the business and is in fact crying out for a final edit. However, in my opinion this game is worth all the trouble, though a CDW novice should probably start with Paths of Glory.

History geeks should definitely pick this one up!

One could see this as a flawed masterpiece and perhaps next to PoG it is, but this is an excellent game in its own right, deep engaging and clever. If you can bring yourself to learn and play this game, little in the CDG world can match it. Like many heavy wargames it could be accused of excess randomness, but the event chaining the delicious tension combined with the fact it has 3 playable scenarios means this is virtual nirvana for the adventurous CDG player.

First time designer with hands off development means a rulebook packed to the gills with chrome.  Worse yet, after numerous post-release bites at the apple, the organization is still bizarre (the political rules require you to switch rulebooks, even though they are not at all optional) and typos continue to exist.  The graphic design makes me long for the plain jane approach of GMT - at least then you would be able to find the counters you need and quickly assess the state of the board.  I can see how individuals find this game fun, but it is far more work for far too little return IMO and I would rather skip a gaming session than go through the experience again.

This is an excellent game on the Russian Civil War.  Components are a joy to look at and the strategy is extremely interesting.  My only problem was I found the rules difficult to read and spent a lot of time paging through the rules to find answers whenever questions came up.

ToC is a detailled view on the Russian Civil War, making it a complex game on a complex war, suitable for the players craving a more accurate depiction of this war. The result is dauting at first, but using the POG engine as its foundations, the game is playable and very enjoyable with a little will.

This is an absolutely brilliant game, blending painstaking attention to historical detail with beautiful components and outstanding mechanics.  A perfect subject for a CDG and nearly perfectly executed.  The rules are a challenge, but well worth the effort to master, especially since the designer monitors the forums closely and responds quickly to all rules questions.  It is really hard to imagine a CDG offering more interesting game play and agonizing decision-making than this one does.  An absolute must play for any fan of CDGs.

Russian Revolution at its best!  The most wanted game in  2005.  This is what the developer of the game describes about: "The game is very tight and plays exceptionally well. Dave has done a great job in rules writing that not only covers all of the bases, but incorporates a lot of historical commentary and illustrations...The map and counters are simply gorgeous, and the cards are also packed with historical detail, as well as having contemporary artwork/photos." Take his words for it.

It is a very rich game, both in historical transgression and flavour. In our game, seeing Stalin and Trotsky fought shoulder to shoulder with Red Armies on the Don Front, while Lenin sitting in Kremlin, Moscow watching the war progress, reminds us what a history.

This is a game I really want to like. It's got a lot of the elements I look for before I invest in a wargame. The scenario is unusual, the system is innovative, the game isn't just about moving units around (Twilight Struggle and Here I Stand are both shining examples of games where it's not only about the military aspects, but also about the politics and external events), and it's from an era of interest.

WOW!!! The subject is epic, the gameplay wonderful. I'm a veteran Path of Glory player, so I have no trouble with this kind of game's military tactics, but the political phase add a new, often chaotic (and DECISIVE) dimesion. 
My only issues are about the graphic of map and counters: all is beautiful to see, but too "heavy" when used to play... especially the map, too dark for my poor eyes. And the pictures on cards, too... why stretch them in such an horrible way? But make no wrong: I'm giving this stuff a "9"!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Paths of Glory system applied to the Russian Revolution. In my opinion, after 2 games, the game suffers of an excess of exceptions to the main rules which slow down the action.
The graphics are amongst the best in the market, though I found the use of scaling pictures without maintaining the orginal proportions not up to the task.

I am very interested in the Russian Civil War.  Previous games which I have tried on the topic have fallen short.  I like David Dockter's podcast (Guns, Dice and Butter).  I think Clash of Arms' production quality is excellent.

RATING: 8.5
Other than Paths of Glory itself I think Triumph of Chaos is the best of the "Paths of Glory System" games being the only one able to recreate as deliciously difficult decisions. The presentation is also stunning, it looks even better in real life than it does in photos here, feels very thematic and  is still very usable (sorting the baroque counters is a pain though). 
Its a little quicker playing than PoG (but this is still not a quick game) and Id guess that in the long run replay ability is even higher given the radically different situations that can be created by the play of political cards / events (unlike PoG you dont know which side the other factions will join, and there are 18 of them! And of course they could actually switch sides or withdraw entirely throughout the course of the game).
The amount of post production clarification/rules changes isnt really ideal and I didnt like the layout of the rules but it didnt cause me a lot of difficulty in the end and at least we know the game will be actively supported on into the near future. Theres scope for a truly spectacular second edition here.

A colorful Sucessor of Path of Glory (GMT). You have more options because You have a political system to gain control of minors. Perhaps there should be a random event table for those who prefer a quicker resolution. But that's not the point for me. Instead a lot of possibilities were packed in this game which make no sense to use. For example nobody will have the time to use the Red Fleet ever or use a special action to roll for logistical inefficiencies.
And one last point is play balance. The designer has tried to improve the whites with some things like the extra Replacement steps for US, GB and France control. But I think it will be a hard time for the Whites, if the Reds will keep the pressure on the south.

Triumph of Chaos is a very interesting game of power, control, and war.  It is VERY thematic and it is eyepoppingly gorgeous.  It is a complex game, but the rules are easily learned and seem logical.  I am rating its complexity at the same level as Paths of Glory.  Also, it is a very long game, especially when you are learning the game.  The time does decrease dramatically after a few plays though.

Definitely an interesting game on an unusual topic.  The game uses the POG engine, but with many, many more special rules and the mechanism to get countries to throw in their lot with your side is almost a game itself.  The game offers an unusual setting, constantly changing circumstances, and far too many options which means that it has very high replay value.  The only down side is that the amount of special rules and circumstances means that your first game or two will be played hopelessly wrong!

Politics, tactics, strategy, good chance... all in one. Will you have the right political card at the right moment? That action card must be used as event or not? Will you move that army here, or is better to stand in this space preventively? Endless factions and countries are present in the game, colouring and making it deep enough to immerse yourself in the skin of the Whites, or Reds!

Absolutely fabulous looking game, both map and counters.....but my gaming partner and I both struggled with the rules which are poorly organised over two books. Game definitely has its roots in PoG, but we spent most of the time with heads in the rule book rather than playing the game.
It does have some really good ideas tho'. Just abit like hard work. GMT's Reds probably a cleaner game on the subject.

One of the most complex and detailed sims of a chaotic situation i have ever seen.  A great feeling of being not entirely in control of the various factions for a two player game.

Too much luck-driven for a two-player-game, too much overchromed and ahistorical setup for Finland (The finish civil war was over then the game starts and the red fins never had a chance without russian bolshevik support, which they no longer got after the treaty of Brest Litovsk as Finland was acknowledged part of the German sphere of influence).

A great game for the period and easily the best treatment of the Russian Civil War in game form to date.  Good design decisions (using POG as a base) allows for lots of period chrome to be tacked on.  Expect to play this two or three times before you get all the sub-systems and variations down pat.  The game absolutely lives up to it's title.  I only missed giving it a 10 because of some personal disagreements about the graphics - it's painfully obvious that COA has never done a card driven game before and the dark gray on black color scheme can get pretty taxing to us bi-focal wearers; it also desperately needs player's aid sheets altough these are now appearing (gotta love the Net!).  The designer responds to every question and rant seriously and helpfully.  You can put Dave B "Doc" Dockter on your list of designers you need to buy everything they make.

A 10, a definite 10! The rules are a pain in the A and its taken me about two years to be comfortable that I am playing it properly but it was worth it, what a blast! The game does a great job of presenting The RCW, a period I know well and am very interested in. It also has a splendid narrative quality and makes for some very tense moments and hard choices, particularly around card play. It has great replayibility and the story seems to be very different each time. Its a hard, hard game to learn well (on account of the fiddliness of the rules)but I highly recommend it to anyone prepared to put in the effort.

The best of the CDW's currently. The element that brings it over the top is amazing graphics, and a rich presentation of history, detail, chrome. I never knew or was presented with the opportunity to explore the Russian Civil War in depth until this one. An intriguing part of history opened up in all its chaotic and intense drama. Although the games might not go as long as intended, or sometimes feel longer, they are so different and interesting I have many plays yet to explore this game.

The game that brought me back to the hobby after ten years. The base rules are no more complicated than PoG. However, there are a load of extra rules, mostly dealing wíth the various non-Red, non-White factions involved in the Civil War. It means that getting everything down right will take some time; as does the game itself--the campaign game really needs two full days of play. This complexity is also offset by the low counter density. Dokter has done his research, and got most things right historically, although in some areas he seems to have deliberately fudged the history, in my opinion needlessly. 

As I mentioned, it is based on PoG, but I prefer ToC. Like PoG, it depicts a war on several fronts, and the players must choose carefully where to concentrate their resources, trying to knock their opponent on one front in order to relieve pressure on the other. Somehow, I prefer the way ToC does this, perhaps because there are no "sickmen" (e.g. Turkey and Italy in PoG) to pick on. The decisions about card use are just as exciting as in PoG--maybe even more so as they can also be used to affect political control in ToC. ToC feels more balanced than PoG, and the mix of different arms and leaders gives it much more character. Many have complained that PoG might be a great game, but it is not WWI--well ToC is a great game, and it is definitely the Russian Civil War.

I also love the fact that ToC opens up a load of counterfactual events--Finnish/White cooperation, greater British involvement etc.-- and manages to include politics inside the military struggle; something which card driven games are well suited to do. 

Sometimes, I find the method of influencing the non-player powers a little frustrating, as it is possible to make a great effort a receive very little reward, but of course this is all part of Dokter's almost perverse desire to create Chaos. Some event cards only have their effect if a certain die roll is made, adding greatly to the randomness, which at times I thought was just a little to much. 

A sprawling, magnificient game, which combines the slightly excessive scale of old AH and SPI games with many of the streamlining mechanics of more recent games.

RATING: 5
At first I was blown away by all the details actually kept in the game since usually these designs are stripped down by developers prior to publication. I really enjoyed looking at the game--  counters, map, cards--   but severe playability problems, rules minutiae and exceptions make me think this needs to be streamlined and much removed.  This game is the complete opposite of "elegant." I find it a chore to play.  "Triumph of Chaos" describes the game and its rules; the historical event was the Triumph of Bolshevism. 7 for the details and work, 3 for the game = 5.

I can't bring myself to give ToC a perfect score, but it does have me considering the sale of other Russian Civil War games I own. This is perhaps the finest game on the subject ever published--and there have been some fine ones. The card-driven engine has had plenty of testing and works like a charm in this game. The components are gorgeous too (maybe some of the counter printing is a bit small, but then I'm getting old). Herr Dockter has something to be proud of here, da, comrade!

RATING: 7
Gorgeous game.  Fun gameplay.  The political subgame is AT LEAST as important as the military game (until most of the factions are committed), which both deepens the turn-to-turn angst of how to best use your card pool, and has the significant additional benefit of making it far more difficult to "script" the game.  There are lots of little grey areas in the rules (and lots of rules--while the core game is fairly straightforward, all the factions, cards, and "chrome" add a LOT of special situations), but one of the huge boons for gamers in the modern era is the online availability of most designers to answer questions regarding the game.  David Dockter fits that profile in spades.

Playing time is quite long (12+ hours for us), but the game has a richness that most don't in this day and age, and I haven't begrudged any of those hours thus far.

I hope to see more games like this--epic in scope, but with the innate randomness, elegance, and hidden elements of the CDG genre.  I DO think that the game could be streamlined a bit (even shortened) and would benefit thereby--maybe the tournament scenario (1919) is the answer for that.

RATING: 7
I actually had a good out-of-the-box first impression of this game, but that faded away over time as I became more familiar with the design.

You get everything here but the kitchen sink; way too much chrome, and overloaded with exceptions. It's virtually impossible to digest this, or so it seems.

[UPDATE] Years later, I had a friend teach me the game in small chunks and it worked out very well. Gameplay is actually relatively smooth once you get some familiarity with how a complex system works. That led to an epiphany, and eventual enjoyment of the game.

The Political system is nicely conceived.

I had misjudged this game, and now that I have sold the 1st edition I would certainly buy a 2nd edition if/when it ever materializes.

An impressive design achievement.

RATING: 10
Let's start with the bad. The rules are a total mess. They're not terribly complex, but are riddled with historical minutiae and exceptions.  Organization is haphazard, at best. Once you get into the game it's not bad (especially if one person is the "exception rememberer"), but it's a steep cliff to climb. I've never studied wargame rules like I study these. (Note: Pursuit of Glory is worse. That says something.) 

The time commitment, while certainly not out of keeping with a meaty wargame, certainly is longer than 2 hours. 

The "CDG deck" contains less "gotchas" than other CDGs I've played, but in return you need to study the relationship between cards in your deck. Card A leads to somewhat neat card B and then very cool card C. Ignore A and you cut yourself off from reinforcements later, but you may need the ops now.

The supply rules are unforgiving, to put it mildly. I've lost 2 games as an entire front collapsed thanks to a turncoat regiment or an unnoticed unit. 

The cards themselves are more wordy than the usual CDGs. On the other hand, they usually have a lot more flexibility than the usual CDGs (Pick 1 good thing from a list of 3... etc.) 

The game itself is fantastic. The player is given many options to do things in the future at the expense of the present.  The counters are great, providing bright splashes of color on an otherwise drab map. 

The political system is realistic. Eschewing the usual "play a card to get some help," the designer chooses something that resembles actual politics; make someone happy, and their enemies will dislike you. What appears at first glance to be random points on the card usually take shape after a few plays. (Generally - the Allies hate the Germans, the Poles hate the Ukrainians, Mahkno hates the West, etc.) I will say the first few turns of politics usually end up tapering out into nothing by turn 6-7 as all sides are chosen up, but what other game gives you this much control over the shape of the war?

So, as one reviewer said, this is a good game, but only if you're insane. If all the above warnings sound more like features than liabilities, this game is for you. Honestly, it's probably a game you'll either love to death or hate forever. Read reviews, think before buying, then decide.

Despite the really bad (very, very bad) idea of putting the rules in two booklets and spraying the tables all over the pages leaving the gamer a bit clueless, this game is a BIG must in the players' shelves. Rich in chrome, yet playable; not scripted card driven game. Great work in research, colorful counters, nice map, nice cards; rest assured you will feel like you are in the shoes of the true leaders of the Russian Civil War.

Just picked this up as a x-mas gift, and stand in awe of the quality and feel of the components. As beautiful and evocative as the cards, counters and map are, however, the opposite is true of the supplementary material... could have really used a more developed background history of the era.  But as this is a wargame and not a history book, my expectations are quite high that this will be as fun to play as it is to stare at and ponder the rise of the reds.

About as detailed, chromed, and historical as a wargame can be - the 'Finnegan's Wake' of CDGs.  Insane and beautiful.  The real search - finding a willing playing partner!

Some games inspire you to learn more about the subject you're playing.  This is no exception.  I know very little of the Russian Revolution except the scant information in High school textbooks.  A great debut for the designer.  He's one to watch in my book.

Ok for graphic and material. The game is very detailed and this limits its potetial because you need to remind a lot of small rules or exceptions.

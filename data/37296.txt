RATING: 6.5
Well, it's Yahtzee so it only gets so good. It's approachable by non-gamers because of this fact too. But thankfully, Free for All is a bit better and a bit more thinky during your turn. Nice components - all plasticy and fun. No score pads (hurrah!) and plays rapidly even with a full complement of people. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This one didn't quite succeed for us, but I really enjoy playing it with my 5-yo.  It plays like a noble effort to improve on yahtzee, but it seems like it lost something in its effort to be more popular -- but that's just one of those life lessons we all learn in high school....right?  

I mean, yahtzee wouldn't have endured all these years if it wasn't a decent game, and trying to make it multi-player and interactive are all good design points.  But it just lacks tension and feels very mechanical.

08+, 2-6 players, best with 4-6, 20 mins. For holiday games. Players try to roll dice to match cards that are face up on the board. If they match, they place their dice in their holder with their card in front of them. Each subsequent player can now try for any of the cards on the board, including the ones other players have taken, if they can beat their dice roll.

RATING: 6.95
Best Yahtzee game I've ever played. The scores are on cards which you take if you roll correct combination, but you have to hope no-one rolls a better combination than yours or they can steal card from you (ex: you have 3 4's, opponent can roll 3 5's and take card). If you have card in front of you at beginning of next turn, you get the points. Also, chips go on cards that aren't rolled each turn, making those cards more valuble. Much more strategy and much more fun than regualr Yahtzee, by far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really entertaining.  I tend to pull out Sharp Shooters instead most of the time when looking for a game like this though.  I'm not sure why that it.  I really enjoy this game though.  I think the reason this doesn't get played that often is the odd way that all of the components fit in the box.  My OCD is acting up just thinking about the weird folds.  I'm starting to hyperventilate just thinking about it.

RATING: 7
A very cool adaptation of the Yahtzee theme.  It seems to decrease the amount of downtime while in turn increasing the player interaction.  There is even some strategy added that makes this the best Yahtzee variant I have ever played.  The components are great, and the way the box has been designed is very cool.  I have had a few issues with the rulebook, including some rules questions and general vagueness on a couple points, but most of this is resolved here in the forums.

What I especially enjoy is the built-in timer that has been put on the game.  It keeps it nice and short and almost leaves you wanting more.  Be prepared for some downtime between turns if you play with 5 or 6 players, but I find that players are always attentive even when it's not their turn.  Something about the chance of their card being stolen makes it interesting even when you're just sitting and waiting.  There is a chance of a runaway leader, but with enough players you can really knock that player back by stealing their cards.  I have often seen a player that no one suspected pull off the win because they flew under the radar.

For Yahtzee fans, this is an interesting twist.  I don't like the way the chips come out when a steal occurs... it just makes it doubly bad to get stolen from when the stealer gets your card and the next player after the stealer gets extra chips on the available cards.

I really like the use of the chips in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First play: 1/17/2009
Initial Rating: A cute idea which gives players an opportunity to steal a scoring opportunity from other players.

Plusses: The box is entirely self contained, with the game board folding up into a box and the lid being felt lined for rolling into.

Negatives: The box lid was too high, and on a high table it's hard/impossible to see what others are rolling. With nothing to do on your turn (just like regular yahtzee), there's too much down time, especially in larger games (5 or 6).

Yahtzees remain poweful scoring opportunities and straights (small/large) end up being game enders.

RATING: 7
A very good Yahtzee variant where you aim to hit one of three possible combinations dictated by face-up cards in the center of the table.  The trick is that once you get a combo, you don't actually get to claim the card for points until the beginning of your next turn.  In the mean time, the other have a chance to steal it from you on their turns.

This all sounds like a nasty game of screwage with just that in mind.  However, each turn that does not take a card from the center adds a chip to all the cards in the center, worth one bonus point, which nicely balances out the desire to steal versus the allure of the bonus victory points.

If you like rolling dice, this is a good one!

Richard Borg Yahtzee is still just Yahtzee.   Borg borrows a bit from Knizia's Exxtra in how you bid your dice for a scoring card and then score it if it is still in front of you when your turn comes around again.  The cards have the traditional Yahtzee goals on them (e.g.  full house, 3's, large straight, etc).   Nice Yahtzee variant for people who like Yahtzee, but that doesn't include me.

This one gets the same rating as regular Yahtzee, one could take the others place and I wouldn't be phased either way. With both you simply play the odds with what you roll and just make the most of it. Free fo All mostly has the same number of goals each turn, where as the original has diminishing choices. Stealing others points (similar to Pickominos) is a fine addition, but in the end, it will always be the luckiest who wins.

No, I ain't gonna fault this game much. So it's fairly random, but you know it serves its purpose as a game you can by at Walmart and actually do something with. There is more risk and decision-making here than you'll find in regular Yahtzee or in pretty much any other game at Walmart. Plus, Richard Borg designed it and he's always been pretty strong with the dice mechanics. Overall, I will get rid of this and continue to play Can't Stop for this type of 'push-your-luck' dice game. In the end, Y:FFA did not have enough tension as you were usually able to do something for points at the end; as such, it never felt like a true risk trying to do something else. But I will say I think the mechanics worked and this would make a good family game for those who don't play board games too often.

AKA "Yahtzee Free Fire Zone"

Interactive [i]Yahtzee[/i] where you have to wait a turn to bank the roll you just made, during which time anyone else at the table can steal it by rolling a higher set, e.g., if you make a full house and someone else gets a better full house, they can steal your roll (this even works with Yahtzees).

Fun with familial trash-talk.

UPDATE:  "The card you lost was only a two-pointer, while she stole my 10-point Yahtzee... so [screw] YOU."

WARNING:  May make wine squirt out nose.

UP-UPDATE:  A mega-hit with my regular gaming group.  Who knew?  I only got it for family & the odd couples' gaming... but once my group played it EVERYONE ran out and bought a copy.  It's a staple at our game nights & days.

This is, truly, [i]Yahtzee[/i] with down and dirty Ameritrash sensibilities.  It is a five-dice abstraction of groin-kicks and curb-stomping.

First played July 2nd, 2008. Taught in 5min, played in about 20 minutes with 6 players. This has a bit of strategy to it however it's mostly a luck game. For those who play Yahtzee and want a different twist to the game, this is it. I'd recommend this to those players and those who want a quick short game. Each player is given 6 dice. The game board has a slot for each to lock in their dice. The deck of cards contains goals to achieve such as 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, full house, 3 of kind, 4 of kind, small strait, large strait, and chance and are woth point values 2-5. Additionally you can roll a Yahtzee for 10 points. Three are turned up on the board and the start player rolls their dice to achieve one of the goals. You get three rolls of the dice. If you achieve it, you lock in your dice, take any tokens associated with it into your VP pile and place the cards in front of your dice on the game board. If the card remains on your next turn you put it in your VP pile. If you don't achieve it, then a chip is placed on each of the three objective cards in the center. The next player may try for the three objective cards in the center or any other players card. To take a players card you must beat their roll. i.e. 2-threes when they had 1-three, etc. If you achieve multiple goals, you may choose which to take. If you take a card from another player you place also place a chip on each of the three cards in the center. The game ends when the chip stack or cards are depleated. Cards in your play area on the board count in final scoring.

Don't let the score fool you - Yahtzee Free For All is perfect for a later slot in a longer game night with some drinks. There's just enough going on to keep you engaged, but not so much that it's daunting. The folded design, while clever, makes it hard to pore through the rules & keep the board flat on the table. The rules themselves have a few less-than-ideal wording choices that put the game end conditions in dispute for us. But overall, for a clearance price, you can't go wrong with this.

This is a nice variation on yahtzee which makes it a more interactive game.  Each player gets an opportunity to claim combinations that are worth points, but other players may steal these points with better combinations of the same type.  Whoever claims the most points wins.  It takes the basic yahtzee game and adds palyer interaction and more competition.

Takes the basics of Yahtzee and builds upon them to form an even more enjoyable version of the game.  I like the "take that" nature of being able to steal from your opponent as well as the addition of chips being added to board when a player doesn't or is unable to pull a community card, especially in situations where a steal is available, but taking a community card provides more points.  A nice level of thought and luck makes this the Yahtzee game of choice for my family.

RATING: 4
Not bad for a completely rehashed dice game.  The ability to steal from your opponents makes it more interesting than regular Yahtzee, and the game seems constructed to be shorter, which is nice.

It still feels too long, though, and you still don't really have too much to do when it's not your turn, which is a common problem with dice games.  

The box design is unique, but not very user-friendly.

RATING: 8
The Good: A very different Yahtzee variant, where you can try to score several different cards in the middle, or score and take away your opponents cards. A fun game. Also, cards thta have not been scored on accumulate chips, which give you additional points.

The Bad: In a game with a lot of players the number of cards that you can score on can get a little overwhelming. The packaging is cute, but the hex-shaped rules will drive you nuts. This is because you have to turn the rules sheet a different direction to read each section, It s very awkward.

RATING: 4
This is much better than vanilla Yahtzee, but in the end it's still Yahtzee. Plays six players in about 20 minutes.  The problem is that with a full complement of players, it's boring waiting for the game to come back around to you.  Yet it's more fun with more players.  I'd play now and then with the family, but I'd hope something else would be suggested.

[i]Yahtzee Free for All[/i] turns [i]Yahtzee[/i] from a game that is basically a multi-player solitaire game into a true multi-player interactive game.  

The game box is a bit gimmicky.  You are supposed to use the box itself to play the game but it isn't at all necessary.  However, I still like using the box to play the game.  There are 30 dice in the box, a deck of cards, and a bunch of oddly shaped plastic chips, which stack easily and are really nice.  Some people have complained about the shape of the box (it's a hexagon), but I haven't had any problems storing the box with my other games.

If you have ever enjoyed Yahtzee, then you will probably like YFFA.  Pick it up if you can find it for a good price.

Thank you, Richard Borg! Now I have something relevant (and better) to pull out the next time my family says, "Hey, let's play Yahtzee!" 

I got my wife and 16- and 15-year-old non-gamers to play it, and it's one of those--far more than any other game I've bought with this purpose in mind--that they picked up and ran with, soon thereafter playing on their own, so much so that I consider it more of a family staple than something I consider part of my own game collection. 

But for all that I'm glad--anything to avoid playing regular Yahtzee, which I burnt out on long ago in college and basically have endeavored to avoid since. It seems to me this game was really well play tested, because--due to luck of draw--some games can be very short and low scoring, others long and high scoring. I like that kind of variety. 

As regards how to play: The 'board' (coated card stock) is a hexagon. In the middle are illustrated card-size slots into which someone deals 3 cards, which reflect the same kind of scoring you'd find in Yahtzee. For instance, you might have e cards that read: 'sixes' 'small straight' and 'full house'. You roll as you would for Yahtzee (5 dice max, 3 rolls max), and try to match one of the 3 cards. If you can't do it, you place one black chip (provided) on a circle in front of each of the 3 cards, and it's the next player's turn. 

If you can match one card (only 1 at a time), you pick it up and place it in a space in front of you. However, if another player on his turn can beat your roll, he can steal your card (but has to place 3 chips down, one in front of each card slot, for having done so). Let's say you rolled two 2's: If another player--before it becomes your turn again-can roll more than two 2's, he can steal your card. To beat a roll of numbers alone (1-6), one has to roll more of that particular number. To beat a "combined card" roll (e.g., 3- or 4-of-a-kind, full house, etc.) one has to at least exceed the total value of the dice (e.g.- for three of a kind, one player rolls three 4's, a 2 and a 4; to beat this another player would have to roll at least three 4's, a 2 and a 5).

If no one steals your card by the time it's your turn again, you can place the card into your own area, and no one can steal that card on a future turn. 

Each card has a point value printed at the bottom of it, ranging from "2" to "3" to "4" to "5," to "10" (for a Yahtzee). 

Also, if when you match the total of a particular card, you not only can pick up the card, but also all the chips in front of it; even if someone can steal that card away from you before it's your turn again, the chips are yours no matter what.

Play continues until either all the cards are gone or all the chips are gone (in every game I've played, the chips always run out first, mainly because sooner or later you get tough cards to match, like multiple Yahtzee cards, or Large Straight, etc.). 

At the end of play, players total the value of their cards, plus one point each for each chip: high total wins, and ties are possible, though rare from what I've seen.

Rating is for who the game is intended for : casual gamers who don't have a prejudice against Yahtzee who want multiplayer interactive dice fun.

Throwing aside the whole stereotype of Yahtzee and looking at it again, Y:FfA brings a lot to the table for casual gaming - there's interaction, aggressive stealing, plenty of decisions (in Euro dice games they call this "risk management"), solid components, cheap price ($10), from 2-6 players, from 6-99 years, trash-talk politicking and revenge opportunities, quick gameplay time, not much downtime, and more.

I've found Y:FfA to be an excellent way to get non-gamers who were only familiar with the typical Monopoly, Clue, Yahtzee, and Trivial Pursuit to experience a real gateway to more solid boardgames. It's an excellent introduction into maximizing your points per turn and risk management.

Reminder : Richard Borg (the designer) says to bank all unbanked cards at the end of the game.
And it's more fun (and tactical) to play with the Tournament point options (+3 pts for any number card you get 2 of, and +5 pts for a 4-number sequence of collected cards)

A nice take on Yahtzee. The original is my wife's and her family's all-time favorite game, but the solitaire play kills me. This brings something I enjoy into their game. We have modified the rules that if no one claims a card for two turns around the table the highest card(s) are scrapped, this keeps Yahtzee cards from clogging things up.

This multiplayer Yahtzee score big for package design. But it's also a decent family game with a high screwage factor (which is precisely what makes it a "family game" in my family). It's pretty fun, but I'd rather play Sharp Shooters when I'm in the mood for a traditional dice fest.

A much improved game of Yahtzee. It's still Yahtzee -- 5 dice, similar combos -- but it plays more quickly and there is actually some player interaction here! I would personally prefer to play something more complicated like To Court the King, but this would be my game of choice to play with a Yahtzee-seeking non-gamer, or perhaps if time is limited: even 6-player games of this should play relatively quickly.

Every time I heard Yahtzee mentioned (I, personally, don't MIND Yahtzee too much) it was followed by someone saying Yahtzee Free for All is better than vanilla Yahtzee.  And it is, because Yahtzee Free for All is King of Tokyo.

That's not fair to King of Tokyo either because King of Tokyo is still much better.  In this game players roll the dice, Yahtzee style, to form a hand in an attempt to match a card from the center of the table.  The cards in the center of the table have standard Yahtzee scoring categories on them.  In order to score this card after you acquire it though you have to hold onto it until your next turn.  Players going after you can steal that card before you can "bank" it by rolling better in that category instead of picking one from the center.

Like I said, it's just King of Tokyo without the special powers which means I'd always rather play King of Tokyo.  This game is still fine and a little better than Yahtzee except for one big problem, the way the game ends.

When you run out of cards to put in the center (or chips which are placed when someone doesn't get a card from the center) the game ends.  So not only may some players get more turns than others giving them an unfair advantage but cards that are stored waiting to get banked are worthless.  This of course makes most people's last turns completely worthless.  They might as well not even roll because they won't get any points out of it.  Imagine rolling a Yahtzee at the end of the game but not getting to bank it.

Some might say, just score those cards as well, well that's not really a solution either because there's no guarantee they deserve to keep that card.  Having the last turn and rolling a bunch of 1s and 2s and taking the chance card for 5 points isn't really fair.  I would even say score those at half at the end of the game but still you would need to end with the last player to make it fair...but there may not be enough cards for the last player to get anything if you do that.  The way the game is designed simply doesn't offer up a good end game and that's a major problem with it.

Also, it's worth mentioning, that the box shape, design, and especially the instructions are some of the most stupid I've ever seen.  The Box is an octagon making it hard to store nicely, the game board actually makes up the bottom of the box and folds up so the board won't lay flat when you play, and the instructions are written on a cut and folded up piece of origami that nearly frustrated me enough that I didn't even give the game a try.  Even the chips it comes with are these crumpled pieces of plastic instead of standard flat chips.

[Hasbro 08 edition] {Dice filler; dice-rolling; optimal 4-6p} YFfA is a nice variant on the Yahtzee.  Yahtzee is a solitaire game but YFfA is a genuine multi-player game.  It is light.  It is chaotic.  It has heavy luck.  But it is fun to play, esp. you can steal cards from the opponents.  So, it's very accessible for new players.

The component quality is good.  But I don't like the weird shaped box.  I wish there were 6 different color sets of dice.  The chips are unique and handy.  It's quite pricey.

This game felt like it could have been so much more.  Instead, its just Yahtzee built with a central "take that" mechanism for scoring.  There's a lot more player interaction than in Yahtzee, but it feels like the luck is more prevalent because you need to trump your opponents.  Rolling 5 6's does no good if nobody else has a Yahtzee showing.

Give me the original, please.

It's similar to Liar's Dice, but not as good. What I can say is that it's much better than regular Yahtzee, but because it's still like Yahtzee, it means that there's a lot of luck in it.

Also missing from it, which separates it from Liar's Dice, is the metagame of being able to bluff and talk up your roll.

So a decent game, but nowhere on the same level as Liar's Dice.

Pros: Better than Yahtzee.
Tons of dice.

Cons: Yahtzee tag scares new players.

Conclusion:  This game warrants additional plays.  For the first play, we had a rule wrong when Yahtzee cards came up.  I believe it will be much better with the correct rules.  It does scratch that Yahtzee itch.

A step up from standard Yahtzee. Can be much more confrontational than standard Yahtzee, but that is fine with older people. Some young kinds will not like having their cards stolen from them. Supports 2-6 (ideal with 3-5, I think).

Eh, it's alright.  It does keep some of the interesting choices of [gameid=2243] and eliminate the multiplayer solitaire aspect of it, but the experience is not as interesting to me.

A nice twist on an old classic.  The name makes it sound like some sort of frantic, real-time Yahtzee fest.  Really it's just a turn-based Yahtzee variant where you claim cards based on standard Yahtzee categories.  The "Free for All" comes from the fact that you can steal other's cards, which adds a small but much welcomed dose of player interaction.

A table of skeptics ("Yahtzee is boring and outdated, duh") was won over by this modern update, which thankfully includes increased player interaction and the use of card-based victory points rather than pencil/paper scoring. The consensus: this is, by far, the best, most fun version of Yahtzee ever released.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Each player has a set of dice. Three cards are turned up. Each card
has one of the normal goals from Yahtzee (full house, small straight,
large straight, 1s, 2s, etc.) and a specific victory point value. The yahtzee cards are available all the time. Roll your dice and try to make one of the goals. Re-roll like yahtzee. If you win the card, you place your dice in the slot and the card in front of your dice. Flip a new card for the next player. Any cards not won get a chip on them. Chips are VP at the end. The next player can win the four cards in the
center or your card. To steal your card they must make the same goal
and use dice of higher value. If you win the full house with 33355,
they could steal with 33366. If the card you won last round is still
in front of you at the beginning of your next turn you bank it and it
is yours forever.  
BTW, the box and playing board is funky.

This is a pretty good dice game that would be better received by others if it had no association to Yahtzee. As it stands, this blows regular ol' Yahtzee out of the water. Not sure about playing with a full complement, and that may be a little long and be full of downtime. 
However, if you enjoy dice games with some push-your-luck and some confrontation, you might dig this.

I'd rate it a bit higher based on the game mechanics (which are pretty good) but my beef is with the theme - I don't like it. Not that I'm a real "PC" guy but the stereotypes on the cards can lead to banter best not heard by most sensitive people.

A terrific little card game rattles around in that big box.  Players' true identities as government, rebels or maybe mercenaries are concealed.  They can play both government and rebel units, while working towards victory for their faction.  Drawbacks; the usual poorly written and ordered AH rules set and too little information on the special cards.

Guerilla is an enjoyable multi-player mid complexity combat card game. (The BGG description is pretty good) Basically you deploy forces to the table then attack other players to kill their forces and capture infrastructure.
The twist is that the troop cards are split and can be deployed as govt or rebel and each player can control both. Each battle awards points to the winning player AND the winning faction. Players have a secret allegiance to one faction and need it to win overall to get full value for their points but may need to fight for the other side to accumulate those personal points! You can assist other players to try to boost your faction's points while (hopefully) not pushing that player's points past yours.

PIcked this up after a recomendation from Aaron.  He play at the SDSU club before I came around and said it was a fun one.  As always, this game was probably better learned from someone teaching rather than reading the rules, 'cause once I picked it up, we never got past the rulebook.  Infact, I think the cards are still in the shrink.

Another of those late 80s/early 90s games that was really cool at the time, but has suffered rather badly from the onslaught of the German games. Still a fun game, but a little too complex, too long, and too little payoff on either. Still, one of the most enjoyable of the games in the  multi-player mayhem style of Nuclar War, Modern Naval Battles, and such.

Interesting hidden loyalty card game in which players play both as rebels and the government. The revolution card which allows someone to swap two players' loyalties stops players from being too obvious but to change your goals at the last minute is quite drastic. The rules suggested playing through the deck twice. Once seemed to be plenty but we were learning as we went.

Second play: Picking up the Revolution card is key, particularly if you have been affected by it earlier in the game (because you know one other player's loyalty) and so it's worth discarding and drawing cards at the expense of lesser point scoring actions. The game is a bit slow and can be frustrating for players who simply don't get good sets of cards into their hands.

Freakin' great...a really cool theme, great theme-driven mechanics, shifting alliances, hidden loyalties, and some great wargame elements add up to one of the best card games out there.  The only thing stopping this from a 10 is the horrendous, labyrinthine rulebook that makes playing and teaching the game the first time through a nightmare.  There's some things that could be cleaned up here and there, but overall I love it.  Why waste your time with dung like Warriors when great games like this are out there?

This was purchased from eBay at the recommendation of Graham Lockwood. It is an excellent game. Unlike many similar card games where the tendency is for players to gang-up on the leader, the clever victory conditions stop this from happening in this game.

Excellent card game!!!  So many things going on in order to establish points.  Highly recommend it if you bought that card game "Warriors" thinking it would be cool, but was completely let down.  This game has the same basic battle concept of Warriors, but has a ton more depth.  NOT RULES but depth in strategy.  Addictive fun!!! 

DOWNLOAD UPDATED RULES OFF GEEK.  A.H. rules are a total mess.

Hardly a historical war game, but fun enough at a convention or when time doesn't permit of a "serious" war game. Clever mechanism in that you can't play just one side without fear of an involuntary conversion. The armor, cache, airmobile, and supply cut cards aren't simple; read ahead to master them. Sometimes pure bad luck (as in not drawing leadership cards) can ruin you.

RATING: 6
Plenty of narrative but long for what you get. It would be a better game if over after one deck and given another development pass to remove or simplify some of the systems (like isolation, ambush counters, damage counters for facilities for starters). Fun and singular but a bit short of greatness ... maybe in the same category as Dune in that it is an older, creaky game that can deliver strong narrative despite a creaky chassis and potentially long play time.

A super fun game of gaining points using both types of forces yet having a secret affiliation that may reduce your score.  Very fun game dynamics.

RATING: 7.99999
This game is fun when all players (best with 5) have the unique game mechanics down pat. Every player needs to keep track of what every other player is doing, both for himself and in support of other players who MAY be fighting for the same faction. Best played at a (not too large) round table so there is at least oblique eye contact with every other player, not entirely unlike Stud Poker where some of each player's cards are visible. Try a game at the WBC run by the designer or any GM who will facilitate a rapid flow of cards and cardplay. Players must accept the lighthearted premise in which one can spend the game acquiring points for one faction and find oneself flipped to the opposing side by an opponent's last minute play of the Revolution! card.

I had a lot of fun playing this but some of the mechanics were more fiddly than they needed to be.  The whole playing both sides of a conflict when you are secretly loyal to one and the bluffing created there is fantastic.  This is what drives the game, and this is what fans of the game love about Guerilla.  Someone ought to remake this, take out all the algebra, and simplify the rules a little bit so it plays faster and smoother, with more of the trademark asskicking and out of nowhere special events!  This is a great game and I would play it once in a while but not something you play often unless you can get a regular group---becoming super familiar would take care of the fiddliness of it and let you concentrate on the hidden alliances.

The first game was impaired by having to consult the rule book on numerous occasions. Still, beneath the surfeit of rules is a very fun multiplayer card game. The mechanics of the game are very well suited to the theme. The latter is a throwback to the days of US-backed Latin American dictatorships, but its treated in an almost comic-book style.

RATING: 7
**Worst box/content ratio ever** 

Ok, the box is completely a waste. You get a deck of cards, a few cardboard chits, and two dice; there is no need for this to be a 'bookshelf' game--crazy! 

This is a much better game than you may think. 

It's the forefather--and a much grander father--to 'Bang!'. In many ways, it's more complicated and that's where it's not fare to compare 'Bang!' to it.

I like the fog-of-war in this--and the uncertainty. Who's really on your side? Who's playing both sides of the fence? Is ANYONE playing both sides...? 

I think 'Guerrilla' handles fewer players better and has more depth in those games. 

I would recommend this but find it more tricky to explain than 'Bang!' and the rule book is a bit harder to get your head around; it's one of those games where hearing how to play it makes the game seem much more intimidating than it actually plays. 'Bang!' has a bit of that too though. 

Truly this is a pleasant surprise of a game.

The theme is not for everyone, and may be politically incorrect these days, but I find it fun none-the-less and am reminded of the Regan years.

Much better than you may be expecting and much more thematic than you may be used too.

Up Front meets Saboteur (sort of). Took me 15 years from buying this to actually getting it on the table!

Old-school Avalon Hill card game, with hidden alliegances adding to the interest. In classic AH style there are more rules here than are really needed and I couldn't recommended to those who don't like a bit of luck or chaos in their games, but played in the right spirit a lot of fun to be had.

The rules re-write here on BGG is recommended, as the original set (while complete and unambiguous) is a mess.

Quite a good, entertaining game!  You don't hear much about it: kind of lost in the Avalon Hill catalogue, along with their other card games like Roadkill and Wrasslin'.  Quite a chaotic game, but the theme is cool, and plenty of chances to screw up your opponent's plans.  Rules could use some cleaning up, becasue it is a lot easier to play than it reads.

I played the reimplementation before the original, and it just brought to light how crudely written the rules were.

Very good multiplayer card game with easy rules. Government forces, Rebels and Mercenaries battle against each other trying to get the best score. No one knows who is who providing some bluff elements.

Pretty good game. Only played once and I made some beginner mistakes. Would play again as I think with a few plays this one could be really good.

You won't find better 3rd world stereotypical flavor than with this game (except for possbly Junta).  The changing alliances fits right in with the theme.

Was so looking forward to this, and the quality of the cards is great (well, the illustrations - the cards themselves are a bit flimsy), but it just didn't quite hang together. I suspect I was hoping for another Up Front, which it was never meant to be. Must replay.

Good game. Card driven like Up Front but multi-player.

Viva la revolution!  Good card game in which a player gets to play two different factions in an attempt to keep secret who's side you are truely rooting for.  With the right cards in your control, you can call in airstrikes, manipulate the Bank, set up an ambush, assassinate leaders and use the UN peace keeping force as a buffer zone or a target.

Definitely my favourite version of Ticket to Ride. Passenger mechanic works really well and the split of destination tickets is great. Really balanced game, the map is brilliant. TTR is a great 'gateway' game. Quick to explain, easy to understand, fun to place trains and play the game whether you win or lose. I would absolutely recommend Germany as a purchase whether you're new to TTR and only want one edition or if you've played them all. Fantastic game!

A by the numbers Ticket To Ride variant that feels very familiar.  The wrinkle here is claiming a route earns you up to two passengers in six or so different colours.  Collected passengers pay off for colour majorities at the end of the game (20 and 10 points for first and second).  Nice to play, and it encourages earlier, shorter routes to get the passengers quickly.

Passenger mechanic ads fiddliness  without appreciably increasing interesting strategy decisions. This is particularly evident in a two player game. Scoring track ridiculously inadequate; winning scores over 200 easily possible in a two player game.

RATING: 9
Perhaps the passenger mechanic on Marklin is better, but I still enjoyed this. I've been advised, by the person who beat us, not to take the longer route cards because the bonus for the most routes completed is so valuable.

RATING: 6
My highMarklin is by far the best TTRpassengers until you have a good enough network, but you also want to do it before anyone else - that tension is unique to Marklin.

I was therefore keen to try this one and it’s very different. There’s a minor level of tension to it as the meeples are limited, but honestly the colours seem like a sideshow

I like this Ticket to Ride better than the original Ticket to Ride as it adds in one variation of passengers.  It totally changes how people build their routes.  Collecting lots of passengers could potentially win you the game, but the best strategy is to complete both some routes and collect some passengers.  My favorite Ticket to Ride game in my collection.

The passenger feature adds a nice little new aspect to the game where you collect passengers (meeples) from cities.  For instance, if you completed the route from Hannover to Hamburg, you collect one meeple from each of those two cities.  With six different colored meeples, end game scoring awards 20 points to a player who had the most of a color and 10 points to whomever had the second most.  

The only flaw I can see in the game is there is a calculation error in the rulebook.  The game comes with 60 meeples (10 of each color).  A map in the rulebook shows you how many meeples should be placed in each city.  If you add up the placement amount from that diagram, it comes out to 61 meeples.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Another fun map for TTR where the twist is that you're collecting different color passengers as you lay track. You get a set collection bonus for collecting the most or second most passengers of each given color [i](there are 10 colors)[/i]. In a lot of ways this map reminded me of a simplified version of the Pennsylvania map. The Germany map is also similar to the original US map because there aren't any special tracks [i](i.e. ferries, tunnels or mountains)[/i].

I've enjoyed every TTR map I've played and will happily play Germany again. However; I much prefer the Pennsylvania map and would almost always rather play that one since there is more variation among the different stocks.[/i]

More of the same formula except with a twist: the meeple majority scoring. I had high hopes for this one and they were mostly met. Having passengers on the map requires everyone to jump on the map early if they want the meeples. It prevents the strategy involving drawing cards for the first 10-15 turns then build, build, build. One concern that I have is with the addition of meeples and the ability to only draw short tickets, the ideal strategy could be to ignore long tickets as they might be riskier to complete. The globetrotter bonus also helps this strategy.

RATING: 7
A straight forward TTR variant. The twist here is collecting passengers (different colored meeples). A majority in each color provides a bonus to the collecting player.
I prefer the stock mechanism in TTR Pennsylvania as providing more strategic choices that the collection mechanism here.

Ticket to Ride expansions and big boxes are all insta-buys for my wife and I. She loves the Ticket to Ride series of games. I do as well, but I crave more variety, so the different maps and expansions is what I need to keep it fresh for me. I like the added collection of passengers for majorities and end game scoring bonuses. We will see how that plays out. The last version that did that, Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 4 – Nederland is one of my least favorites. It plays fine, but the end game bonus seemed to determine the winner on every one of our plays. Since there are multiple bonuses, it should spread the points out more evenly (if players are playing well and getting rewarded accordingly). I never was able to run across a copy of Ticket to Ride: Märklin, so this reworking of it was a must.

RATING: 8
I like trying to collect the passengers.  Gives the game added complexity but doesn't take away from the basic fun.  I just wish DoW would tone down the fonts.  It's a bit of a challenge finding the cities on the map mainly because the font is hard to read.  Repeated plays should resolve this.

RATING: 7
My personal average rating across TtR, TtR:Europe, TtR:Nordic Countries, and TtR: Germany.

The meeple majority adds a mild twist and potential comeback mechanism/alternate strategy.

See my comments on the original game for my thoughts.

RATING: 8
Long colored routes discourage random draws form the deck.  No tunnels reduces randomly missing a turn.  A great map that emphasizes that stuff about TtR that is strategic!

The German version is prettier than the Europe version and being able to choose short or long routes is such a nice tweak! Never played with tunnels or stations anyway from Europe, like the 'streamlining' they did here.

[DoW 2017 Edition] {Train; connection, card-drafting; optimal 4p} Ticket to Ride: Germany is a fine take on the Ticket to Ride: Märklin.  This game tries to reduce the complexity of the game and make it a more family friendly.

The meeples are cute.  If one already has Märklin, I don't think this is necessary.

random distribution of passengers adds some welcome variety to base game - one minor gripe: wish they had put key for number of passengers in each city directly on the board rather than forcing players to constantly have to look at rulebook while setting up

RATING: 8
This map is more challenging than the other TTRs I've played; there is ample opportunity for blocking other players, some of the short routes are problematic regardless of length, and chasing meeples for end game points can be distracting.  Perhaps the massive 20 pt. gain for majority in a given color of meeple is extreme; I am thinking of house ruling it down to 10 for first place, 5 pts for second place.  After just three plays, I don't want to rank in the pantheon of TTR just yet. There is more to be discovered.  Certainly better than Rails and Sails, however, that much is obvious.

Not my favorite version of the game. It feels like the passengers score too much and are a too much of a game breaker. The core TTR mechanics are still here as they are with the other titles. The biggest downfall for me was the game end. The person who triggers the game end "by having 2 or less trains" gets an additional turn. The way it worked out in our 5 player game. Player "A" triggers the end game and two players ended up having 1 less turn than the other players. This sort of breaks the game for me. Sure it's an easy house rule, but why should we have to do that?

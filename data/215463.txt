I'm generally not a fan of abstract games, so this is really quite an incredibly high rating from me.

At the start, Tokyo Highway seems like it will be pretty boring. However, as the network of roads gets more tangled, the game gets much more interesting in two ways:

1) It's simply more interesting trying to place your roads in such a way to set yourself up for a score once the table has many criss-crossing roads, while preventing your opponent from scoring.

2) The dexterity element really starts coming into play. When you're trying to wedge pillars and rows into tight spaces, it can really become challenging. At the outset of the game, I really did not expect this to come into play as much as it did!

Overall, just a very unique mix of abstract strategy and dexterity, presented in a very nice, clean, appealing way.

A nifty little tactical and dexterity game. Surprisingly tactical and clever. The end game scenarios always look like a pieces of art! Brilliant!

components were so slippery that play was agonizingly slow to prevent "destruction" and only one of three games could be finished!  If this is meant to be a dexterity game, it's not a very fun one.

The table presence is off the charts, and the game is fun. It felt like the rulebook could have been a bit clearer.

Really enjoyed this game. Obvious dexterity element, but very quick and easy to play. Fiddly enough to test but the test is unlike building towers for example.

But there is real gameplay here, as the game requires a lot more than dexterity. The more we played, the more subtleties emerged. As well as anticipating your opponent's options,  you must plan your own actions without leaving more scoring opportunities open. Where you place you car on a roadway matters. Clever placement helps block the options.

The product is beautifully made. At the end of each road piece, the tip is painted with a special roughened texture. This acts to provide more grip, especially when the tips overlap. This little touch makes a real difference and shows the maker has thought it all through.

I simply cannot recommend this game enough. If you like this sort of game, you will love Tokyo Highway.

A fun dexterity game for 2 players. The rules are simple and the game plays fast. The dexterity aspect is there, but it is more about strategic placement and outmaneuvering your opponent.

Strange combination of dexterity and abstract strategy.
In both plays, the game has devolved into total highway collapse when players start making complicated builds in order to score points.
It's still been fun though, but it might wear of in the long run.

Very interesting mix of strategy and dexterity. The best plays can fail because of their fiddliness, the dumbest plans succeed because of their stability. I like it.

枠のないアブストラクト。どこに置くか角度の付け方などを自由に選択できることが気持ちいい。ある程度定石は存在するし、戦略を生み出している感覚を得られて満足度が高い。手先の器用さも要求される部分もあり、ゲームに入り込む瞬間がシステムにより用意されている。もちろんゲーム後の絵面も素晴らしい。

Tokyo Highway is neat to try, but I think that is because of its novelty value as opposed to its merit as a game.  Overall, this game feels like a fun constructive project that you laugh about once or twice and then never return to.

Immediately loved this game as soon as I saw it. It took me roughly two weekends to finish my homemade copy. I had never played it before, but I knew I would enjoy it.

Even after only 3 plays I've come to appreciate the tactical strategy where blocking your opponent is almost as important as scoring your own points. The yellow junction columns really enhance the depth of the game in a way I didn't expect.

I'll be making another set hopefully soon, and enough pieces for 2 more players on my set. I'm quite disappointed in my lack of paint-mixing ability, and I may re-do my painting of the columns when I paint the next pieces.

Interesting idea. I played it with a few different people and we all had the same reaction: fiddly to the point of annoying.

The sticks inevitably fall off the cylinders and cause a cascade.

OMG...I must be out of my mind...ordered 2 copies from the BGG store, Nov 2017
Arrived Nov 28 2017
Good game, but quite difficult to finish. Easy to disturb previous construction. Not for everyone. It's tricky to try and respond to your opponent's growth, you have limited pieces to build with, and the finish on all the bits is slick so you can't make the pillar heights too steep or things start to slide. And if you knock things down, you are allowed to repair the build but have to give up pieces to your opponent, which is really bad.
Sprayed one set of cars green and purple, added 4 cut dowels for buildings.

Pleasing dexterity and area control, but I'm slightly miffed that it doesn't support more than 2P. It would seem that with three there are several factors more possibilities. Also, the rules for the yellow pillars aren't clear. Lots of people fell in love with this on appearances alone, but I feel there's something missing.

Wanted to love this so much more than I do. Got my favorite picture from the year, however! In the end abstract dexterity is something I enjoy, but didn't work for me in this game for some reason. I felt there was nothing I could do to catch up. Didn't care either way so I just found it boring, I suppose.

A novel dexterity game, I will give it that. The problem is that a topple of a significant magnitude can render the game somewhat difficult to finish. 

(+) Simple, accessible, and, at times, tense gameplay.
(+) Functional components, which is essential for this type of game.
(+) Rewards clever maneuvers in impeding your opponent's construction.

(-) Not really all that exciting gameplay which leads to...
(-) ...a surprisingly, anti-climactic ending.
(-) A particularly clumsy move can end the game abruptly. Who -honestly- wants to rebuild ALL of your opponents pieces that you have dropped?

Physical game both lovely and simple with evolving complexity.

Don't believe comments that it is too slippery. The week connections are pay off the game, an intentional limit on what angles can be built. A prior edition featured textured sticks that reduced slip and this was dropped, I believe wisely. In a typical game my wife and I drop zero pieces, so unless you have have tremors or are being overly greedy in the game, collapses are important as a threat boundary, not a frequent phenomenon.

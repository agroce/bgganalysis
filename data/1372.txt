Definately no simulation and not a great game either. Strategy seems pretty basic and beyond that victory is down to luck of the draw.

Like the idea of being able to play a mini-campaign in a single session, but when I don't believe in the dogfights even that's not enough to draw me in.

I like the dogfighting game, don't play the campaigns. There are some cards that are much better than others (a pet peeve of mine) but there's skill involved. Rules could use a rewrite.

First Game: 5-12-2007
Pretty cool game.  Nice and simple.  I like it.  I wish there are ways that we can actually help our teammates.  At least the game we played, we mainly just played three 1v1 fights in a 6 player game.  I am willing to explore the game further, but I don't think I'll buy this game since Ebay is asking $125 for this and that I want more interaction between planes.  This game is sorely lacking, at least in dogfight mode, ways to help each other out.  I know it won't be thematically acurate to be able to bail out another WWII plane from damage, but that is what I want from games like this.

Almost totally luck-based, but still has something of a nice  historical feel as the cards=energy idea seems to work quite well. I'm not sure that qualifies as a recommendation, though; Eighth Air Force, with the better planes (and therefore larger hand sizes and card replenishment rates), probably is the most interesting game. Like Up Front, kind of a filler or side game for serious wargamers (although DiF isn't anywhere close to being in the same league as Up Front).

An excellent game that balances a fair degree of simulation and atomsphere with simple, easy to learn, and sensible mechanics.  I really liked the back-and-forth cardplay and the way position is handled- the potential is there for some very dramatic dogfights and exciting turns of fortune.  The dreaded luck element that the beardstrokers will probably home in on is actually pretty small since there's a fairly small spread of unique card types- smart hand management and timing are as important as having a good hand.  I've only played dogfights, but I'm thinking the campaign game might push this one up to a 9.  A really awesome system that demonstrates that economical mechanics can be used in _good_ games rather than pointless Euros.

After a few plays at CSW Expo 2017, I guess it's a decent filler/side game when you need a break from the monsters. It plays quick, and you can have fun with it, but overall the mechanics aren't that interesting to me. Plus, there's a couple hoser cards that can really decide the match. I think I'd rather just play WW2  [i]Wings of Glory[/i].

World War II air combat game that uses a deck of cards.  Players throw cards down at each other trying to get their pilot and wingman into an "advantaged" position relative to their opponent.

This first version of the card game is dated and Zero! is a better jumping in point today.  I picked this up to get all the early war european aircraft because I enjoy the game.  It's quick and light but it feels right somehow...  Military based card games are a hit with me,  they always seem to have great fog of war and quick play.   The newer artwork is a big improvement.

First, the Down in Flames (DiF) basic game: On the face of it, DiF is an interesting concept.  Each aircraft's card represent its energy and limit how it can react in the current situation.  It is a very elegant system, and I highly praise elegant mechanics.  However, the problem is when you, say, compare a Spitfire with a Fw-190.  These aircraft performed quite differently but play nearly the same in DiF: a Fw-190 trying out turn a Spitfire in real life would have bled off too much speed and probably find itself inside crosshairs, but this is perfectly possible in DiF.  In short, DiF is an abstract game with an air combat theme.  To be fair, no game has simulated air combat realistically without getting as heavy as, say, the Fighting Wings series.

The DiF campaigns are just a sequence of missions with little interaction between them.  As a playtester of a DiF expansion, I learned that the variance of campaign results was huge and they are near impossible to balance.  I suggest using them as a random mission generator rather than playing the campaigns.  Furthermore, the rules for bombers and campaigns are not near as elegant as the basic game and feel like an afterthought.

Wish I liked it more. I've bought each game in the series as it has come out, but the game never gets any traction with my group. We play a dogfight or two, and it goes back on the shelf. The campaigns were fun at times but I'm not sure they were worth the effort. I would love to see a PBEM engine for this game so that I could really devote some attention to it -- as is, the game is a tweener, with the campaigns taking the time of a standard wargame without delivering a wargame's simulation or satisfaction.

A really neat card based aerial combat system. Lovely artwork and a really good game system. The dogfights are the best bit of this game. The expansions add to the feel of the war with bombing and specific attacks but, these also add a lot to the rules. Again a game that used to get a lot of play which has fallen by the way of late. Needs to be replayed! Have 8th Airforce expansion to this game and also Zero!

Good game, lousy simulation of air combat...actually, in my opinion, almost no simulation. It remains popular since It is fun to play, it plays fast, it has pretty cards and easy rules.  These make it a good game by definition.  I enjoyed playing it for a while, but felt as some-one else did, it really comes down to being a card game of winning tricks and remembering what tricky special cards to hold and play when...Since I'm a detail oriented geek, I prefer the much more accurate, and yes, more complex boardgames on air combat.  I do get annoyed whenever someone states or claims that this GAME has any resemblance to real air combat.  Folks - it don't - except for using pictures of planes and fancy phrases on the cards. I guess I'd play it for a lite diversion once in a while over beer while watching football.  But don't expect to learn anything for real about WW2 air combat...the same system could be used for UFO combat, tank combat etc...

I love this game, and the Eighth Air Force add on.  Quick playing, unpredictable, and addicitive, it is a great game to play with a friend.  The dogfights are okay, but when you play the campaigns and the decisions faced when deciding on a resource, it is great fun.  The only problem with it is that due to it's abstract nature, you can ocasionally get unreal circumstances like a Stuka shooting down a Spitfire.  Other than that, it is a great game.

Next time we are adding in Down in Flames rules for air combats.  Should work very well.

I guess I hoped for this to be the Up Front of air combat, but it wasn't.   The dogfights are an OK distraction but eventually grow bland so you turn to the campaigns and find them unbalanced (and at times unworkable).  Sad to say, that has remained the same across all later games in the system.

This is the first installment in the Down in Flames series of card games that simulate WWII air combat. Each player has a hand of maneuver cards which he uses to improve his position relative to an enemy plane or fire on the enemy. The opponent is allowed to counter the maneuver by playing cards of his own, to which original player can counter back, etc. The last player to play a card determines whether the original action occurs or not. Each plane is rated with horsepower (which indicates how many card you can draw), performance (how many cards to be held), burst (the values of fire cards that can be played), etc. The number of cards in your hand abstractly represents the momentum of each aircraft.

WW II card game based on having dogfights in the air. Planes have certain abilities (number of cards to hold, damage to take, firepower), play cards to manoevre yourself in a better position (or get out of a bad position), use your wingman to support you. Fun to have dogfights with opponents with different planes and fun to put the opponent in the proper position after a half loop. Game is self contained so no worry about collecting cards. My gaming group seems to like the campaign game where they develop pilots, but that seems too long to me. The bombing runs on ships/town scenarios were okay, but the scoring system seemed heavily weighted in favor of the defenders.

Just getting started with the Basic game which is almost excessively luck driven (like Scarab Lords, only one game in three is interesting, the others are routs). Hand size may be the real limiting luck-factor as probability will dictate that smaller number of cards will require more luck to win. Horsepower just defines when that luck is required, low values force early risks. Rules make a simple game more complicated than necessary. Weight is for the Campaign game, the slightly generous rating is for the Basic game so far (short playing time allows the higher rating) (may be a 7 as a Campaign). Tactics so far: Start High, dive to get extra cards, stay Low to optimize Horsepower, kill opponents Wingman when neutral, use your Wingman to gain position on opponent Leader and then destroy him and to deplete his hand, always use/discard so the maximum number of cards can be drawn, when no attack options are available change altitude to deny opponent Wingman an attack and discard useless Attack cards to hopefully have either better protection or Attack/Response cards for opponent's and your following turns.

I really, really like the ideas behind most of Dan Verssen's games, but for some reason, with the sole exception of Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, I haven't been able to really get into any of them.

I heard the campaigns + expansions make this one better, but I never got to try them.

Rating for Basic Game: A beer and pretzels game of dogfighting WWII planes. Players draft planes of varying points values (depending on capabilities of aircraft). Each airplane has a hand limit, card draw and attack card value which affects what players can do with card. Damage planes have weaker values.

Players then use a hand of cards (attack, manuevere, etc) to to either damage or destroy opposing aircraft over 6 turns. Good fun, plays quickly and has lots of options for team games, controlling multiple elements of fighters, etc.

The luck of the draw is annoying at times but the game plays so quick as to mitigate that anyway. There are some clever mechanics like a wingman having a 'mini-hand' to attack/defend. The simple system elegantly recreates dogfights. Scenarios add historical play value.

OOP and expensive so I advise getting Zero! (very cheap and similar to this game). GMT is GIVING away a copy of Zero! with the purchase of Corsairs and Hellcats.

This game is CLUNKY. The rules are terrible and the combat system unplayable.

Simple card game of air-to-air combat, each player flying pairs of fighters/bombers.  Plays fast, good opportunity for trash talk along the way.  Problem with the bomber/campaign games; seemed like it was never possible to do enough damage via bombing to win, even if your bombers got through.

I like it very much for the design of the basic dogfight. The added campaign rules aren't bad, but they encumber this game with too much stuff and take away the lightness of the original design.

Not as compelling as I had hoped. Still, has some interesting aspects and the dogfights are fun.

I love WW2 air combat. However WW2 air combat games always left me cold, with their slow and cumbersome plotted movement systems. RotL and its follow-on games in the Down in Flames series perfectly capture the turn-and-burn feel of a dogfight. The campaigns are interesting and there are a lot of challenging matchups.

Feels clunky. It really needs more than a few planes to make it cool.

Gave it away to the Wargamer Pay It Forward Facebook group.  (Where it was given away AGAIN one week later!)

I have been fascinated by this game and its relatives for a long time.  Each time I play, which is only occasionally, I try to figure out if there&#039;s anything more to this game than chaos.  There may not be, but I love the theme, art, and fun mechanics anyway.

Light card-based wargame. The campaigns in the later games of the series are better, and the early card art here is drab compared to the later games. Still, it's a simple way to enjoy some Battle of Britain dogfighting, as well as send some of the weirder German aricraft on various missions.

Actually a really nice twist on the original.  Very competitive and a good hand management game.  You can get slayed by luck, but an even game is always close.

Very good re implementation for a 2 player version. I like the idea of helping your opponent to have some advantage yourself....

The Gameのいい部分（協力しあう感じ）がなくなってしまい、やや残念。相手を助けながらやけど、そこまで盛り上がりに欠ける。

Finally The Game works!

I've never liked the "co-operative but limited talk" aspect of the original game. This is solved here.
The bad luck randomness is greatly reduced as the numbers range from 2-59 instead of 2-99. Also there are more ways out that will benefit your opponents in case you get stuck.

Great mix of push your luck and risk/reward.

Get this version!

Fun competitive variant of the great game The Game

This is most likely my favorite variation on all of the "The Game" versions.  The head to head nature puts a new twist on a game I really enjoy.  Deciding when to "help" your opponent has as much in it for you as it does them.  Face to Face has the same artwork that puts some off to the game, but still is fine to me.

Excellent conversion of a co-op game into a 2-player competitive game. I especially like the added element of having to help your oponent occasionally. There is still a chance that players can get themselves stuch but I think that more often than not players will end the game by depleting their deck and ultilmately it's going to be about who does so first. Really really enjoyed this one.

Works very well. I like the competitive aspect against the other player. I can say if you like The Game you will probably like this. You can only play 2p though. Happy to have this in my collection! I do like it better than the first one

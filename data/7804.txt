RATING: 6
A fun game that is way more than just memory... at first I had trouble, trying to memorize where everything important was. After playing for a while, I realized the importance of bluffing and changing tactics depending upon the cards in your hand. Moving the barriers is a fantastic mechanism which should not be taken lightly; they can make the difference between a win and a loss. This is one of the better Kosmos 2-player games I've experienced, and is definitely underrated.

Dracula is a fun 2 player filler.  It's somewhat of a concentration and deduction game where Dracula and Van Helsing must find each others "special" cards to win.  Draculas has coffins and Van Helsing has Maidens.

not a bad game (but then again I hardly see bad games anymore), but not terribly exciting either. There is a strong memory component, which I'm not a big fan of; you're basically just systematically checking board locations and remembering what's there. The components and artwork are top-notch.

This is a memory game where you move and change the cards around, therefore it is absolutely impossible to remember where is anything. Notwithstanding, looks like a good game. Played it only once.

so much worse than your classic crap games because it was actually trying to be something.  the sticks are virtually useless.  a true joke of a game that has you rechecking the rules to see if you're screwing it up somehow.  play mamma mia instead.

Game has a strange sense of asymmetry due to the various objectives and powers of the Dracula and van Helsig players.  A descent part of the Kosmos 2-player series.  The barriers do not match the game theme.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

Came highly recommended by Sam Healy from the Dice Tower, so I picked it up BEFORE I realized that Sam is killing that show for me and his taste in games is a complete non-fit for me and I am starting to really hate listening to his stupid voice, his stupid opinions, and his stupid face.

RATING: 5
I don't particularly enjoy the memory aspect of this game, but there are some engaging decisions and interesting mechanics in this bluffing game from the two player Kosmos line.

The theme is beautifully captured and there can be some deliciously tense moments when you are trying to outwit your opponent on the board.

Perhaps a variant where you can record the position on the board would make us sleep deprived, forgetful people somewhat happier.

Only one play so far.  I thought it was fun (and with experience it should play reasonably fast) but my wife didn't seem to be into it.

Edit: After another play, convinced that being better at the game will make individual decisions take less time, but increase the number of turns you have to play to reach a conclusion, so I don't think this will ever play very quickly.  So probably staying at 6 or lower.

Good little game.  The memory aspect makes it perfect for those nights when you want something a bit different.  The rules are a tad ambiguous in their phrasing, but once you get them right, it's a good time.

This has actually hit the table quite a lot, recently.

I found this more entertaining than my husband, who thought the whole thing somewhat arbitrary and tedious. I liked the bluffing aspect, switching cards (or pretending to switch them) to fool your opponent, or pretending to forget which card was where to switch them out. 

The game does drag a bit toward the end, and seems to have the capacity of going on forever, but it was fun enough for me to want to play again. 

UPDATE: My husband was right.

Tedious memory game with admittedly great graphic design.

OK to good if you like memory games. I don't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Components: Hefty wooden pawns, and a great board. The cards are of average quality, but the artwork is pleasing to look at.

Experience: It wasn't until the end of my first (and only) game that I felt I really understood all the elements. There is a real tension about where to place my victims/coffins. I almost wish I had just included them all into my initial shuffle, because it was too unnerving to watch my opponent zero in on them, like playing Stratego with multiple flags to be captured. And the board is so tiny, I felt there was nowhere to hide.

With very little variety in the encounter cards, the game still manages to be complex, and despite the limited number of cards on the board, it was all I could do to just remember which belonged to which player, without actually remembering what their values were. Perhaps not my type of game, being a bit too tense for my tastes, but a good game, nonetheless.

RATING: 5
Two players, Dracula and Van Helsing, are trying to located each other's "target" cards, dispersed over a 12 location city game board.  The pawns move as far as they like, but they must be able to discard a movement card to cover the distance moved.  The cards also contain combat strength, actions and blocking moves, so card play is quite juggling act.  Lots of memory and bluff, but with some clever tricks thrown in.  One of the better Kosmos two player releases of late.  Seems to take longer than the 30 minutes claimed on the box - allow an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We started out using the "face-up" rule, but eventually figured out that face-down made much more sense so switched to that.  Turns out it is officially a typo.  Anyway, it's an interesting game, but the memory aspect is a bit too high for my tastes.

RATING: 6
Not bad. A little game of hide-and-seek with a heavy dose of memory and hand management with special card abilities. The barriers can provide for an interesting little game-within-a-game. 

I doubt this will ever be one of my favorites, but it's fun from time to time. Somehow the game is better than the sum of it's parts. The ability to land on your opponent's figure's space and view her hand, for example, is inspired genius, and fixes what would otherwise be a game that is far too luck driven. 

I should also mention that the theme fits the mechanics dead-on. No, it's not a "simulation" in the "vein" of Fury of Dracula (arf arf) but neither is it a generic tacked on Euro theme. For me it works very well. 

The map and card art are very nice, but I wish there were different pictures on the action cards, since you look at them constantly and they are all the same. Also, Dracula looks a bit too much like Brad Pitt. But maybe that's just a personal issue.

My biggest issue which keeps Dracula from being a keeper  would be that the game really seems imbalanced.  Van Helsing's action cards look a LOT stronger than Dracula's.  You also have to have a good memory to do well in the game, which doesn't really excite me.  Despite these oversights there are a lot of interesting things about the game.  I like the 4-way functioning action cards, deciding how many gaming winning encounter cards to have in your hand vs. on the board, and the many bluffing opportunities.  I feel like this could have been a really great game, but instead is very mediocre.

I enjoy the actual you vs. opponent feel this game has that can sometimes evade Lost Cities. A game that loses value as you play more.  About 15 plays before I started logging plays. 

This game gets a big personal downgrade because I cannot memorize face down cards (I was terrible at memory growing up) If you like bluffing, and can handle memory, you should consider this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[2 plays, 1 as each side]  Nice asymmetric hunting-the-hunter game.  I think both our games ended by someone running out of life points, rather than by either side gathering the cards needed to win.

This has a Concentration-like memory element; there are 12 (I think) cards on the board spaces, and as you move about and see them, you try to remember what's where.  This is complicated by the fact that there are some actions that move cards about, and whenever you land on one of your own cards, you can if you wish exchange it for one in your hand.  What I want to try next is playing this game with note-taking allowed.  I'm not sure whether this will make or break the game (hence the desire to experiment!), but my hope is that it will elevate it from a memory game to a deduction game.

The german edition is playable, but constantly checking the crib-sheet is a drag and removes the more subtly elements of game-play. A nice idea, nice mechanics, very nice graphics and bits, but not a hit.

***

Replaced my german copy with a US copy and played again. Got a rule wrong first time (forgot to replace cards face-up), played again and we both liked it better. The game made more sense and was both easier, more fluid, and more challenging. Will play again.

And yet... the rules is wrong! The replaced cards are meant to go face-down. Deary me, we'll have to try again. We liked it face-up.

I picked this game up for two reasons, one was for the theme, and the other for the play mechanic. I enjoy games with a memory element. I've purchased several games with memory elements, and use the play to sharpen my mental focus and short term retention. Dracula is a game that has to be "mined" for the real value it contains. There is a lot of subtle strategy that can be used in card retention and placement, and I find the bluffing portion of the game enjoyable. My wife and I play this game, and I find it works well for what it is - a light bluffing and memory game that can be played quickly when you've got 30 minutes to spare. As an added bonus, your short term memory may get tuned up a bit. Mine did.

RATING: 6
* Played 10+ times. It is mainly a memory game, but it is not purely a memory game. Mix a little of the action card flavor of Hera & Zeus with a small board with "Memory" type setup, then use a Dracula theme and you get the idea. Nice feel, unique enough to want to enjoy this and bring it out more often, and short enough to almost warrant an '8' rating. [f]

Clever little game for two.  Like Hera and Zeus, it took many readings of the rules, which seemed rather daunting, before diving in.  Once in, everything kind of made sense.  This is definitely a worthwhile 2-player game -- it hints at the gameplay style of H&Z, as well as Mr. Jack a little.  The bits and art are GREAT (though the colored barriers are an odd splash of color in a dark, dark game).

A light game of memory and not-memory. Keeping track of the cards played on the board certainly helps but they are swapped out often enough that good memorising alone won't win the game. It's just as much about bluffing and getting lucky than it is about skillful use of cards and clever blocking of your enemy.

RATING: 8
I have only played this three times but I am enjoying it so far.  Trouble is I have only played against an opponent that dislikes memory games, and gets confused.  I feel it captures the theme wonderfully, as things pop out of the shadows, and innocent victims lay unaware of whose coming around the corner.  Another great Kosmos 2-player.

UPDATE: Oddly enough, even though I am personally intrigued by the game's mechanics and play, no one I know has any patience for this.  As a result I have to reluctantly lower my rating to a five, as no game is anything other than boring if you can't find a willing opponent.

UPDATE:  I happily got the chance to play this again, and was impressed by what the game offers.  It offers a marriage of mechanics that blend well to make an interesting, somewhat brain-burning two player experience.  Although the memory element is key to good play, the ability to change encounters, bluff, and control the board with barriers(even though this is the one element that feels gamey rather than infused with the theme) creates a tense multi-faceted small box game with enough intriguing decisions for the alloted time.  I have recently been enjoying games with a risk element (Beowulf, Taj Mahal) and Dracula offers it in a tight package - granted not as polished or elegant.  I can see the score rising with further play, but also plateauing around a 7.  So for now a jump back up a point to a 6.

UPDATE:  Two more games down and I will say that this game is a fun little gem.  It creates great tension when one side appears to be within a turn of victory, or when you become limited by movement and you are buying time before you regain full strength.  The memory aspect drives the heart of this title but there is a lot of room for clever plays and strong bluffing.  Upped to a 7.5 (beyond my original prediction)

UPDATE:  it's an 8

Fun two-player game.  I played it with my wife, who is not good at games involving remembering hidden things (like face-down cards) and she did not like it.  It is fast and not too random.  I like it and would play it again.  

Play involves moving around a small board and looking at face-down cards, trying to find target cards and fight your opposing cards.

Actually I don't know what I don't like in Dracula: there is tactics, there is bluffing, there is out-manoeuvering and outsmarting of opponent. There is all that but it lacks something engaging, something undefined. Something that makes a good game a great one.

Interesting asymmetrical deduction/tactical game with hand/deck management and cool mind games. I felt it was a bit too ambitious with the action cards being numbers, attack, skill and move barrier actions in every single one. I played what I needed to play when the fights popped up, and that took the strategy away. Still, it was a nice experience and I want to play again.

RATING: 6
This rating might go up or down if I ever find anybody who will play properly with me! There is a memory element to this game which can be as difficult (try to remember every known card in every position) or as simple (just keep track of which cards you need to turn over, and which you don't) as you want. But neither of my regular opponents even bother with the simplest form, so I keep beating them handily. Don't be like them and dismiss this because of the dreaded memory element - it's easy if you bother to try. And you can also play as we do, with shared knowledge remaining open (leaving known cards face up) to reduce the element even further. Without both players bothering to keep track of the cards, the bluff and maneuvering elements of the game collapse and it becomes a bore.

This is another in the Kosmos two-player line.  As is typical in the line, the components are top-notch.  The game is interesting and unlike others here I am unbothered by the memory aspect.  (It's only 12 squares) I definitely like it better than Kahuna and the abysmal Balloon Cup, but it is not on par with the best of Kosmos (Jambo, Odin's Ravens, and Lost Cities)  The colored barriers while adding some tactical depth ultimately drag the game on far longer than necessary if deployed well by two players.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (July 2017)

My desire to play Dracula was low. I played it expecting a bad game, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The rules of the game are pretty easy to teach. You can do it under 5 minutes. The rulebook could be a lot better. In the RioGrande edition of the game there is a big typo in which the rulebook tells you to leave the cards face up when in reality, it meant face down. Big mistake. Playtime is around 20 minutes. 

Dracula´s components are ok as is the art.

The theme is pretty cool, but you don’t feel it much when you play the game.

The goal of the game is to find the 5 cards of your opponent. Dracula´s decisions aren’t very complex, but they aren’t that obvious either. Each turn you decide how much are you going to move and if you are going to see the hidden cards. If you do, you can win a card, fight or exchange a card. After that you play a card from your hand and then apply its power and move a barrier (hinders movement). It sounds more complicated that it is, but it is very easy to understand. 

Both players play very similarly, but with different cards. I feel both sides are balanced, but I need more plays to verify this point.

The feature I really like about the game is the memory element. I love memory games. To me, memory is just another skill to use when you play and Dracula features memory very prominently. There is a bluff element as you can keep the important cards in your hand, but if you get caught with all of them in hand you will lose. The idea is to strike a balance between the cards you hold and the cards you risk on the board.

Luck plays a significant role. Not only you can get lucky when you explore a location, luck of the draw is present, but as you keep a hand of five cards at the beginning and as you learn the game, this kind of luck will decrease.  The game offers pure tactics, not a lot room for strategic planning.

These days I often l play a game and then I sell it. There are a few games I keep among my game collection and I will still probably sell Dracula, but I need it to give it another spin before deciding.

Bottom line, Dracula is an ok memory and bluff game. I will probably get rid of it, but the memory aspect of the game is fascinating to me. I will play it again before deciding if I should sell it. I feel it is underrated here on BGG.

Play a couple of times. Overall an ok, little two-player game that's simple to explain and play. However, being a memory game, if neither of the players are on the ball it can have a tendancy to fall flat, where each player simply moves around the board turning over cards at random, and what should be a quick session can start to drag.

I don't know that I've ever played a game that I would literally consider "broken", but this comes close. I'm just not sure what the motivation is for landing on your opponent's encounter cards. If you only stay on yours, then the target cards never need to get played to the board. Eventually Van Helsing would win an interminably long game if both players did this because he has an ability to pull cards from Dracula's hand. The game doesn't make a lot of sense to me, to be honest. What's with the colored sticks, anyway?

An interesting entry in the Kosmos 2-player line that feels significantly different from the rest. Half guessing game, half memory, I can see why this never gained traction in the market.

A strange little memory game. Not much in the way of theme; there isn't any chasing or hunting of vampires. Players just move across the board and lay traps for their opponent. You then move around the city trying to avoid the traps while hoping to encounter victims/coffins. Great artwork. Unfortunately its just a little too rules-heavy for the occasional light play.

So with my wife and I enjoying Hera and Zeus so much, I decided that playing good two-player games together might beat the endless movie/TV watching (I can only take America's Top Model so many times) that seems to occupy so much of our time together lately, I went out and bought two more, including this one, Dracula.

Once again, I was impressed.  If Talisman and Memory somehow had an unholy half-breed child, you might have an approximation of Dracula.  One person is Dracula and the other is Van Helsing, each with their appropriate powers.  There is a small board of 12 spaces that are randomly given cards.  The two opponents move around the city, with Dracula trying to find 5 victims and Van Helsing trying to find 5 coffins, and both trying to run the other out of energy (hit points/health).  They can also encounter Dracula's brides or vampire hunters, with a few other cards thrown into the mix.  

Once you encounter a space there is either a fight, or if it is one of your cards, you can take it into your hand and put a different card from your hand back on the space.  Obviously, this is where the main strategy of the game comes from, playing mind games with your opponent to try to steer them towards or away from certain cards, and remembering where you put your cards and which cards are your opponent's.

While I still enjoyed Hera and Zeus and Jambo slightly over Dracula, this was still a great buy and is a great game to bust out and play with a partner in less than an hour.

A minor flaw of the game is a slight imbalance of power in favor of Van Helsing, hence you should always play two times and switch sides.

[b]Depends a lot on memory. And chance - e.g. if one player happens to find lots of target cards early on because they happen to align right. We had one game that was over after each player had only had two turns or so, and skill had very little to do with it. And the rules are a bit complicated for what it is.[/b]

RATING: 7
Despite the lengthy rulebook for its size, this is a simple game with a lot of levers to pull and layers to explore, and it's fun to play. The components are great, particularly the art, and the rulebook is one of the best-organized and easiest to reference that I've encountered.

Even with relatively few elements, there's so much going on -- memory, bluffing, risk vs. reward, hand management, resource management, and more -- that it's sometimes hard to know what to do in a given turn. That's not always good, but here it's enjoyable.

This is a neat game overall, and one I'd happily play again.

Weird but interesting as well. I don't know if it has legs, but it's fun after a couple of plays. 

Update 11/15/15:

After about a year since playing it, we picked it up again tonight. It was fun. Interestingly, I thought I was getting killed early on, and even past the mid-way point. Of course, I ended up winning in the end, which was great to see--not because I simply wanted to win but because it shows that the game is not deterministic. I like it.

Biggest bluffing game we have yet.  Some comparisons to Mr. Jack (cards, bluffing), and Fowl Play!, but definitely more bluffing going on here.

Played nine times. A nice game. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't care for games that have such a huge memory element. Too bad, since for a German type game it has a strong theme. Well, except for those barriers (four colored wooden sticks). I don't know what they're supposed to represent; the rules don't say.

Pretty impressive for what amounts to a memory / bluffing game.  I'm always looking for fun two player games and this one has a believable theme that's quite fun to play  (although I never felt too terrified by Van Helsing's vampire hunters).   Rating just went down a point ... all the above is true but the game is fairly dry despite the good theme.

RATING: 6.5
Good theme, nice board and components, in a cheap package. I really don't complain about the memory element, and I sincerely think that the game could be better if it were a "memory on steroids". The problem is that the start of the game is way too random and chaotic, so someone lucky enough to step in the right places can win the game effortless. Need more plays to settle a score.

RATING: 5
Play cards and manipulate the board to find five victims (Dracula) or five coffins (Van Helsing) before your opponent.

Plays: 1.
Type: Deduction game = A game where you attempt to deduce something through elimination.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 60 mins.
Player interaction: Opportunity prevention and misdirection.
Randomness: Low – card draw, but the cards are not decisive.

Replayability: Not so high, I’m not a big fan of deduction games. This is the best deduction game I’ve played though.
Fun: There is fun in successfully misleading your opponent. The double-think is also kind of fun when you get it right.
Memorability: Decent, you’re playing your opponent more than the board and that makes for a memorable experience.

Thematic integration: Everything but the colored barriers is well integrated, but they drop it to only decent overall.
Components: Again, everything but the colored barriers is very good, and the beautiful card art does a good job communicating the theme. The colored barriers drop it to only good overall.

Who will like this: Spouses that want a deduction game.

Definitely a winner. Even despite my appalling short-term memory, and also my appalling short-term memory, this is a terrific little hand-management and bluff game which is much under-appreciated by The Geek. Atmospheric card art and a nice push-your-luck movement mechanic are the final flourish as far as I'm concerned.

Whatever anyone else says here - the two sides are asymmetric but NOT unbalanced. Certainly there's as much equality as in The Confrontation or Blue Moon. C'mon people - pick up Dracula and give it another go!

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I haven't played many deduction games, it's just not my thing, but Dracula was fun. Part of it's charm was the really beautiful production (another Kosmos 2p game), the wooden figures for Dracula and Van Helsing are amazing. 

Game play is a good mix of bluffing, memory and planning ahead. In our one and only play Mat and I found Van Helsing's powers to be much better than Dracula's. However, it may be that Dracula's powers take a few plays to figure out how to optimize them. I wish I had played this sooner, I would loved to have played this with my son on Halloween while passing out candy. I'd recommend checking this one out, it isn't one of the more popular 2p Kosmos games, but it is one of my favorites.[/i]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good, solid design--nothing exceptional, but plays quickly and offers plenty of choices and strategy. 

Actually, the only thing I don't like is the reverse type in the rule book--an unfortunate result of design applied to theme, to the detriment of readability. 

I'd suggest that players read the rules carefully, as there are a lot of specific rules to keep in mind. The one detailed example of play helps, too. And, there's a critical mistake in the rules, namely, when you reveal a face-down card on the board and it turns out to be your own, you put that or another card from your draw pile face DOWN, not UP, as printed in the rule book. 

But overall, it's a fun 2-player game, as there are many choices to make as each game unfolds. I think on the whole it's somewhat underrated. (Faidutti, for one, agrees--see his "Game Library".) Caution: because of the memory element (cards are revealed and often turned back over) it's not a game to be played when tired or with people who don't like the memory aspect.

RATING: 6
To do well, you need to memorise each of the 12 cards on the table, plus memorise which ones have been altered (possibly) by the opponent since last you visited. I can do it, but for a 30 minute game with spouse, this is too much work for us to be fun. There's an element of 'what would she have changed that to' which turns it into a outguessing game over and above the memory element. It might come out occasionally for the theme (which works well, hunting Dracula down) and if we keep it light and don't worry too much about the win or the memorising. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game! Unfortunately, this game didn't get many good reviews at the time it came out.
Almost all players seemed to agree upon the fact that it is easier to win whilst playing with Van Helsing rather then Dracula. Me myself too, thought it was a somewhat unbalanced 2 player game, favouring the Van Helsing player. But I was so taken by the lovely design and theme that I wouldn't give up on it. I insisted in always playing as Dracula, and finally I got the hang of it. It isn't unbalanced... you just have to play the game differently when playing D. This game is, above all, a memory game, and a fantastic one at that. Try it out enough and you'll see eventually ;) My favourite game in the Kosmos 2-players series together with Spaceship Catan!

Re-acquired via BGG trade on 11/10/2017. Gam

Had bought and sold the game pretty much without playing it (the now ex wife wouldn’t play it) after its release, but recently got on a Dracula kick, and acquired it again all while designing my own game. Played it twice as Van Helsing with my girlfriend. One victory, one defeat (after being well ahead on the energy cube front). Found it quite enjoyable as a cat and mouse game. Good memory is definitely helpful, byt that is far from being all that there is to it. There are definitely decisions to be made in terms of which encounter cards to put in the initial encounter deck, the order in which to play your action cards, how to use barriers to channel your oppoent, whether to swap your own encounter cards, etc. Better than its BGG rating suggests Ibut it I also true that BGG ratings for older games tend to be lower simply due to rating inflation).

Nice artwork to complement the theme of Dracula trying to find victims while Helsing tries to find the vampire's resting places.  Players try to lay traps on the map while keeping the other player from their goals.  There is a memory element as players need to remember where they have their encounters on the map (and where their opponent has played encounters).  However, if players are tired or start getting confused about what's on the map - the game can drag a bit.

From reading some of the negative comments here I was expecting a somewhat boring memory game, but I was suprised to find a game, not about remembering cards (although it is part of the game), but more about bluffing and hand management. Theme fits the game and helps to raise tension.

I recommend this game strongly.  Nothing entirely new, but it's fun nonetheless.  Ya, I likey the horror-y themey, but that's not why.  It's "Memory" light, but not overwhelmingly so, and adds enough that's different to keep it interesting and more involving.  The mechanics are simple enough to pick up in a few minutes.  The entire game takes about 15 minutes or so and I always want to play again.  High-quality components, decent (not great) artwork, and adquate balance make it a great time-waster or lite starter or finisher.  Not worth calling the neighbors up and roasting a pig for, but defintely worth $20 or so, IMHO.  One of the better two-players out there if a lengthier, meatier selection is not appropo.

I played this game once and won it (against Buckle :)). Its like LotR: Confrontation in that it captures the assymetry of the two sides well, but where that game is tactically scrumptious, this is just kind of dull. If the women on the pictures were more erotic I would play it again.

People keep insisting that this is a bluffing game rather than a memory game.  I'd argue that it could only be a true bluffing game between players with perfect memories.  <b>Update</b>:  Bumping my rating up a point from 5.  I'm still not wild about the memory element, but after a few more plays I'm starting to appreciate the design.

This is a high rating for me, considering how much I hate the similar card combat used in games like Dungeon Twister and Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation.  The "combat cards" each have about four different purposes, so I swallow my disgust and try to accept it.  The colored barriers could have used some "color" by representing angry mobs, the police, the clergy, etc.

RATING: 2
Oh the Dracula cards are so clever.  They are all The BLANK of the Night.  I kept joking about a The Stink of the Night card as the game undoubtedly reeks like a bad beer and cabbage morning.  There is no question that this game works, but it just is a lot of random wandering around hoping to get the right cards.  

The only real gameplay here is in blocking people off and switching cards around. What may be a memory driven game is now really defenstrated as you switch the cards around to make the slight chance that people may remember what cards are what become an impossibility. Of course, it only really matters when your opponent ties or loses to one of your minion/hunters.  So what does this game become?  Hedging.

This game really should be about running rats through a maze with each rat hoping to get some cheese.  Instead, this is mearly the cutting of said cheese.  The art and the pieces are pretty (although, the concept of Van Hellsing's energy cubes makes me laugh at the absurdity).  Most of all, while I understand that clarity is the key to conveying ease of game play, brightly colored fences (don't ask me what these are supposed to mean in terms of a Dracula theme) are garish compared to the dark tones.  

Yoko Ono created a Tear Dispenser where you put a quarter in the vending machine and a tear comes out, it is a nice concept and technically it works, but ultimately it is a useless waste of space.  Dracula doesn't need a quarter to get my tear.

I really like this underrated little game!  Excellent components and artwork, to go with the theme - which, to me, doesn’t feel pasted on (like in some games).  Seeking out Dracula’s coffins and victims, and encountering  dangerous vamps and vampire hunters seems just right.  Yes, it is a card game with elements of memory, bluffing, hand management and so on, but my advice is not to get too hung up on the memory aspect - I hate memory games and am hopeless at them, but still like playing this.  [Of course, it helps if your opponent isn’t someone who has a photographic memory and/or plays games super-seriously ...].  ‘Dracula’ is fun to play, looks good, is for 2-persons, and only 30+ minutes - what’s not to like?  Definitely recommended, but give it a chance while you get the hang of it, though - I originally scored it a 6 on first look, but now closer to 8!

Revised rating from 7 (2007) to 6 (2011).

My favorite two-player game so far. The look and atmosphere are great, the duel between Dracula and Van Helsing a pure pleasure. I think strategy and tactic are perfectly balanced here, full of bluffing, memorizing, planning, plotting and tension. I could play it over and over!
(the number of plays here doesn't represent the actual play number, I need a copy of it again!)
I got a copy! And I still love it! Didn't realize until I replayed it tonight that it has a rudimentary deck-building mechanism in it, well, more a deck-shuffling than building but considering it came out a few years before Dominion I thought that was interesting. And it is just one thing this 2-player has going for it.

I think this game might be just a tad underrated.  The theme and card artwork are nice and the game mechanics make for interesting memory-style type game play.  Now that I have played this one a few times it seems to be lacking "something" but I'm not quite sure what.  Maybe it needs to have a bigger board, not sure.  Regardless, a fun game that has some interesting strategy to it and doesn't take long to play.

Not elegant at all - hard to figure out how to move, confusing as to whether or not you should replace a card with what you just looked at, hard to remember if you are then allowed to continue to move, barriers seem retarded and added at the last minute to cover up some gameplay problem (like movement being silly).  The path to victory is not intuitive at all.  Yet, a game I would gladly play again if my opponent already knew the rules and I didn't have to spend 20 minutes reading them again and trying to explain them.

A pretty strange game with a mix of hand management, bluffing and memorization. One player plays Dracula trying to find 5 victims, while the other plays Van Helsing searching for 5 of Dracula's coffins on a grid of 12 spaces. There are also vampires and vampire hunters cards that you have to fight against if you encounter them. All in all, I thought it was fine for what it is, a light filler game. From what I read, some people strongly dislike the memorization component of the game, but I'm pretty good at it so I didn't mind.

On initial play, I would have rated this as a 5 or 6 as a disappointing memory game.  After having played a couple of times, I realized that you can overcome some of the memory aspects by tracking a handful of locations.

After getting over that hurdle, more strategic things come into play- pressuring a player by repeatedly getting them to show you their hand, trying to corral them and dropping nasty encounter cards nearby, etc.  IOW- good game, but those first few fumbling games keep this down to a 7.

I take issue with all the complaints regarding the memory element:

1- memory elements in games are not inherently flawed or something to be avoided.  i could write an essay on why.

but more importantly:

2- this game isn't a memory game.  you will, at ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM (and it's highly unlikely it will reach this point), be remembering the location of 12 cards.  most of the time, you will only possibly have the ability or need to remember the location of between 5 and 8 cards. if that's a hard task for you, there are deeper issues with your perceptions than i can cover in this comment. and as the game goes on, the possible combinations of those cards shrink.  if this is difficult for you, then:

A- we're approaching the difficulty level of remembering your left from right and
B- just leave revealed cards face up until someone performs a swap on them.  gameplay will be virtually unchanged.  try it, i'll wait.  ta-daa, not a memory game.

One of the best two-player games I have tried, Dracula brilliantly combines its hunt-search-bluff mechanics with the world of Dracula's London. The card art, board and pieces are very good, and the game's only failing is the error in the rules (telling you to place cards face up instead of face down). So, turn down the lights, put on a flickering fire, and go seeking victims or the crypts of the Count.

Interesting little game. I expect having much more fan when i am really into all the tricks and tactics. I love the fact that the game can be won by 3 different ways. Not as much of a memory game as i expected. The theme goes well with the game.
Some say the game is quite unbalanced in Van Helsing's favour. I don't think so ... and after all a few house rules will do ... or play for both sides (20-30min a game).

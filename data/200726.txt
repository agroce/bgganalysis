A clever sundae of mechanics from other games - points from splendor, card drafting from ticket to ride and turn tracking from Thebes. With an ice cream theme scooped on the top.
Pretty cool.

RATING: 4
1 play / 2 players

LIKE: Great artwork by McIver.
DISLIKE: Too simple, no depth. Very random with card draws to get the final treat you need to complete a location card. The paths to victory are obvious. Too few cards supplied in the game, too much shuffling involved. 

OVERALL: A game for kids, not for me. I thought I read somewhere it was like Glory To Rome-- but it's far from it.

RATING: 7
Nice, light, frothy recipe game with adorable art. Plays fast and easy - adopting the last-gets-to-move mechanic smartly to keep things moving along, yet costing time to do more valuable actions. It ends quickly and only gives a moment to catch up at the end. A keeper - certainly fun enough.

A great card game for a very small box, the cards have three possible uses so it's a smart game, easy to learn, easy to play. Good for experienced players, excellent for casual ones.

Love the ice cream art in this one, but the game itself feels a bit mechanical in its execution.  For better or worse, I have never been too much of a fan of the Glen More, jump ahead too far and you wait, mechanic.  Nothing too bad about Rocky Road, but nothing very exciting either, though the theme is fun, and might be particularly fun for kids.

RATING: 7
A cute little game that has you trying to win awards by filling ice cream orders faster than your opponents. Not a terribly deep game and it's easy to see the end of the game coming, but it's a simple and fun enough little filler game that's easy to transport which makes it worth hanging on to.

RATING: 8
Fun little game where no one is ever really out of the game.  Amazing how a player can make that strong push in the last moments of the game to emerge victorious.  I like multi-use cards and the incorporation of the turn order mechanism like Patchwork.  I also appreciate the designer/publishers decision to include 4 cards that make up the turn track in addition to the full foldout board.  I tend to take my games to the pub in a card carrier, so this was a welcome detail that they took into consideration - portability.  Kudos to the Green Couch team.  Great game with a small footprint and time commitment.

Sounded interesting, but ended up not being interesting at all.  The circular action track where you keep  going until you pass someone only works if there is a reason to jump forward a decent amount (Glen More), and this game doesn't offer those choices.   Too basic to be interesting.  Pass on this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm a big fan of the Thebes/Patchwork time track resource and Rocky Road makes good use of this mechanic. The theme and artwork provide a major enhancement for this game, because it doesn't really separate itself from other fillers through innovation. Driving an ice cream truck is an easy sell to non-gamers and the rules are simple enough to fit that audience. However, I shouldn't sell it short. There are some interesting decisions to be made, and the game just feels fun to play.

Splendor like with interesting movement mechanic.  I think all in all I prefer this game to Splendor at the moment.  Part of that is the newness of this game and that we have played Splendor out.

Rocky Road à la Mode is a game about stocking up your ice cream truck and delivering to your customers as efficiently as possible. This game boils down to set collection coupled with the turn order mechanic from Tokaido or Takenoko, whichever isn't the game with the Panda. I always get those two games confused... Its not a bad mechanics mashup, but its not really great either. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Hmm... I keep trying to convince myself I should like this more, since the mechanics are all things I like: set collection, public goals, time track, resource engine... but it all congeals into a game that is unsatisfying to me. I think my biggest gripe is that the game is simply too short: just when you've built a decent engine, the game ends. Maybe playing to a higher score would help? I don't know. The board is really cramped and the theme does nothing for me either, so maybe I'd just rather play Splendor.

As 1000rpm noted, this game is a sundae of mechanisms from other games - engine building from Splendor, time track from Thebes, and multi-function cards from Glory to Rome. You don't get nearly the variety of cards that you get in Splendor, so I wonder about longevity.

[b]Rating based on - 10+ plays, 2 player[/b]
Crafted on 29/5/17 This is a race game where you are trying to fulfill ice cream orders for the customers at your truck as fast as possible, but with also wanting to get the most points. The person who gets to 9 points first triggers the game end and everyone else gets a turn until the person that triggered the game end is furthest back on the road. So that person might not necessarily win! Decisions revolve around whether to spend a lot of time collecting cards so you have more options, but running the risk of your opponent(s) fulfilling orders and being ahead in the points race; and whether to fulfill orders that give you a permanent benefit or immediate points.

Very fun little card game filler that hits the sweet spot. I love multi-use cards, quick playing small games especially if they have a bit of thinkiness to them, and the use of the time track mechanism such as in Thebes, Patchwork, Glen More etc. The rules are simple, and the artwork is bright and colourful. It gives a very Summer-y feeling. That being said, the major negatives are:
1. we find ourselves  having to shuffle quite often especially near the end of the game which breaks the game up and doesn't make it play as smoothly as it could,
2. the game plays super quick so you feel like you've only just got started and the game is over, 
3. the ending can be rather abrupt. Someone gets a 4 point victory card and then it's over very suddenly.

The last two points can sometimes leave you feeling unsatisfied which is why I don't score this one higher. It's fun to play, and I'm happy I PnP'd it so it will always have a place in my collection. A nice end of the evening kind of game.

A fun, fast, light game that is great for passing some time or just as a filler when needed.  The theme is nice and the engine building mechanics really allow for a variety of strategies to take shape over the course of a game.  

It is light enough that just about anyone can pick up the basics rather quickly and it plays fast enough to not outstay its welcome as well.

This game is a headache in a box. The visual design completely ruins it for me: I'm all for bright colors, but the background objects are just as saturated and have the same visual weight as the objects you're supposed to be paying attention to. This annoyance is multiplied by the dense amount of abstract symbols on the cards, making the game a chore to play.

Really needed two copies of every card to be fully enjoyable.  I know the production was a little cheaper with half the number of cards but it unfortunately makes the game almost unplayable for more than 2 and seems cheap either way.  Besides that, the game is a fun filler race that plays quick.  The art isn't my favorite but fitting.  

A somewhat different production and maybe one extra layer to gameplay might have been a better route for this game.

This is a great little game with a lot in a box for a little money.  The idea of doing a lot but getting too far ahead and letting your opponents do a bunch of actions until they catch up is where the tension lies. The mechanic is similar to the scoring track on patchwork.

Rocky Road uses the time mechanism known from e.g. Glen More and builds a game of collecting sets to fulfil orders on it. The game is fluffy but not inconsequential. Using time more efficiently and combining the right cards together provides for light but interesting decisions. A solid filler hampered by garish artwork.

Certainly a fun game that combines aspects of Patchwork and Splendor.  In regard to Patchwork, there aren't necessarily alternating turns.  Rather, whoever is behind on the time track keeps going until they are in front (same here).  Also in Patchwork, there are single-square patches that can be picked up from the time track and placed anywhere on your board.  In Rocky Road, there are Firecracker popsicle tokens that can be picked up off the time track and serve as wild cards.  

The Splendor similarities are in acquiring resources (ice cream and popsicles here, gems in Splendor) and using them to acquire cards that give you victory points and permanent versions of those resources (spend push-pops and ice cream cones to permanently get a push-pop, etc.).  While Rocky Road a la Mode doesn't really offer anything new as far as its makeup, it does combine these existing elements into a new game that is fun and colorful if nothing else.  

The box says this game plays in a half hour.  In a two-player game, things move much quicker and you can knock out one game in half that time.  I have gotten a lot of games off of Kickstarter that were busts.  Thankfully, this is not one of them.  It's lighthearted and worth a buy.  The rules are quick to grasp and setup is even quicker yet.

RATING: 7
Good as almost any other game with an action point track. It calls for a deft balance of scoring for points, scoring for bonus symbols, and scoring for enough symbols to obtain a bonus card. 

Far trickier, and deeper, than I would have ever expected. This is the best Green Couch to date.

RATING: 7.5
This is truly a great design. Just the additional variants put in here show that the designer has done his homework: an optional board (if you just want to take a deck of cards with you), specific ice cream tokens instead of wild ones for more variety, and so on. This one is extremely well thought-out and I will hunt it down as soon as I get a chance to do so. Don't let the funny name and overly "cutesy" artwork fool you guys - great game!

RATING: 5
A colorful order fulfillment game about running an ice cream truck.  You move along a track for each action your take (like Thebes and Glen More).  The other players can take actions until they pass you.  You can take up to five cards on an action.  Play a card to attract customer and then fulfill orders.  Each moves you further along the track.  When you fill all orders you get victory points and possibly a virtual ice cream.  

First to 9 awards ends the game.  All players get to take actions until they pass the player that ended the game.  The person with most points wins and if tied it is whoever is furthest back on the track.  

It is a colorful game, but very simple.  I really don't like the art.  But it is good to play with kids over 8.

Neat game with shades of Patchwork (time track), Splendor (cumulative bonuses), and Isle of Trains (contracts). Charming theme, bright, borderline psychedelic art, and solid graphic design.

Gameplay is good, but can feel too abrupt when it ends; often the final turn after the endgame trigger is useless. Need to play more.

Wouldn't turn down a play but don't be drawn in like I did by claims that this is Splendor with Patchwork turn order added to the mix.

This is a nice palate cleanser between heavier games.  It's got some decent decisions, and the strategy behind your card drafting and use is pretty clever.

It's fun to build your engine - it had a bit of a Splendor vibe going in this respect.

My only criticism is the number of cards in the game.  At 2 players it's fine and not really noticeable. At 3 players the deck runs a little thin.  At 4 players you'll be shuffling 8 cards towards the end of the game.  I would have preferred at least 50% more cards.  I'd pay for the difference in cost to get this "upgrade".  It's a great little game despite this problem though.

Yuck.  I wish I could be specific about why it didn't work.  It seems like all the mechanics should work together, but in the end there just weren't a lot of choices that mattered.  It has a little "engine-building," but lacks time to build an engine that matters.  In the end, we weren't playing to win -- we were just playing to get the game over.

A lot lighter of a game than the multi-use cards suggest (might look overwhelming to more casual players, but they're actually really straight-forward), but the artwork is super colorful and attractive and the theme is great, and there is just enough thinking here that it's not a total filler.

The game did start to feel a bit repetitive after awhile, but thankfully the end of the game was pretty shortly after, so I don't think it's a problem. This is not really a game you'll want to play a bunch in a short period of time, but bringing it out from time to time, with the right group and it's worth picking up a copy, especially since it's so tiny and portable (wish more games came in this small of a package).

[Green Couch Games 17 Edition] {Food, Truck; time-track, set-collection, card-drafting, multipurpose-cards; optimal 3p} This game is highly recommended by my game buddy.  She said her kids like this much and my daughters would enjoy too.

The trick is to optimise your move so that you send fewer actions to get more bonus points.  The variants are forgettable (the extra tokens are unnecessary).

Regarding players count, 3p is the sweet spot. 2p is of little interaction and 4p is too crowded.

The rules may be difficult to children.  It takes some time to explain the different icons on a treat card.  But, in general, children can understand the game easily.

The card illustration and tokens are colourful.  The trucks are nicely made.  They look real.

Games like this really impresses me! I think Rocky Road à la Mode is so well designed. Such a small games with some cards and tokens but there are so much you can do here. The multi use cards works just great and they all seem really balanced. And its really thematic, every action you do on the cards somehow ties perfectly in with the theme of the game. And the artwork and especially the vivid color palette of the cards is amazing. This one is a keeper

4/16/2017 - I'm not sure what I think about this game. It was a little too fast to get to the nine points, but I'd have to try again I guess. I just got three cards with a point and a permanent treat on it, which got me a three point bonus park, and used those free treats to get a three point card, and boom, nine points... It has interesting mechanics, but the game I played was just a little odd.

Great game. Lots of fun, great artwork and components. Some strategy involved, as you don't want to get too far ahead on the track too soon, or you'll be waiting a long time until your next turn. The only negatives, in my opinion, are the size of the truck meeples in relation to the game board squares. They're too big, and take up a little more than one space. The game track could've been made a little larger to accommodate them. Other than that, I think this is a keeper. Very portable, and a reasonable 30-minute gameplay.

What a pleasant mix of set collection, resource management and last shall be first turn order.  Easy enough that my 5 year old could handle the mechanics but enough options to make a good game night filler.  Another very good small box game from Green Couch!

This game has a perfect blend of mechanics from Patchwork and Splendor. The theme is inviting and wholesome. Rocky Road is best enjoyed with another player and ice cream.

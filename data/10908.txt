A nice game and now that I am playing it right it is very balanced between the two sides and very fun to play. I am interested in seeing how these decks will intereact with the decks in Scarab Lords

RATING: 7
This game has the same rules as Scarab Lords and the two games can be played together.  The components of this game are nicer than Scarab Lords.  The board, pieces that show supremacy (minotaur heads) and cards are higher quality.  I love the "Lords" system rules (the same for both Scarab and Minotaur Lords).  Unfortunately there is a misprint on many of the cards in this game (the Horde cards)- errata has been released fixing the misprint which caused balance problems with the game.

My total lack of enthusiasm for Scarab Lords led me to never play this before trading it away. Ah, well, I guess every Knizia can't be a hit.

RATING: N/A
There must be something very strange going on here. The quality of the cards is terrible - much worse than for Scarab Lords. They stick together, can't be shuffled, or even slid across each other or fanned in the hand. Yet a few others have mentioned here that the card stock is improved. Did I get a bad set somehow. I will contact them - because the quality is so bad that I had planned never to buy another of their games.

RATING: 6
An Under-rated game by most.  The short playing time is a bonus and thematically and tactically this is a very fun two-player game.  It is like Blue Moon but a bit less subtle.  The rating is the same for both this and Scarab Lords.

Decent 2-player conflict card game.  The Minotaur decks are much more powerful than Scarab Lords (it seems like the Minotaurs would woop the Scarabs pretty badly), especially in the department of specific card removal.  I'm not sure what, but something about the game play keeps me from moving this up to a '7'... but there's just enough here to keep me from moving it down to a '6' or less.

Okay as a non-ccg card game, quite quick and easy to learn, but I enjoy Blue Moon so much more than this - can't see me ever wanting to play this over Blue Moon ...

RATING: 3
The game concept is solid, but the weakness is in the decks.  If you draw a bad first hand, you will lose.  If a player snags dominance in the first two turns, then 95% of the time he wins the game.  I would have liked a little more randomness.  With house rules though, this game could rock!

After one play, it seems like blue can out muscle red quite effectively. Not really sure how red can win against the hordes which, even erratad, are really really strong. I'm sure further play would reveal balance, mind.

However, I can also state that unlike Blue Moon (Reiner's other version of MtG). this game is easier to find the fun with right out the gate. You actually feel like your decisions matter.

RATING: 5
I've only played once...but I tought Minotaur Lords was on par with Blue Moon, in terms of Knizia's 2 player CCG-style games. The decks are assymetric, and require different play styles...but they seem fairly well balanced. He includes a nice customization method to help fine-tune the balance if you feel like its needed, by using a 3rd deck of cards to change things up.

I was disappointed in the production quality of this one. Its not terrible...but the cards start to look worn out after just a few plays. 

I enjoy that there are multiple paths to victory. I enjoy that there are multiple simultaneous duels for actions on the 'board'. The game seems to work fairly well. 

Its just that I didn't find anything in the game box that called to me to come back for more playings. Granted, I'm not too big on card games anyway. I even traded my Blue Moon stuff away after a while. But Minotaur Lords left me respecting it as a game design and not terribly interested in pursuing further plays. I'd be happy to play if an opponent suggested it, though.

Not as good as Scarab Lords.  Same game system, but the blue deck in Minotaur Lords has Horde cards with are value X (based on number of Horde cards in play) that are ridiculously over-powered.  Still, the red deck could/should be played against the decks from Scarab Lords.

Utterly worthless.  Without the eratta, blue wins every time.  With the eratta, red wins every time.  Another overrated game from Knizia.

Initially it seems that one side is stronger than the other. The key is that the two decks are quite different to each other and require a totally different style of play.

Clever, almost CCG-like, card game - companion game to Scarab Lords.  Players play their own decks and attempt to win influence in two of the three spheres of influence in two halves of the board.  Lots of back and forth, however a clever "phase" mechanic means you have lots of choices of "what to do when?".  The advanced game, allowing deck tweaking between rounds, plays well.

Like a weened-down Battleline with asymmetric sides and card powers.   The problem is that the flavor didn't really add anything and didn't feel very inspired or interesting.   While I'm certainly a fan of asymmetry in games, it didn't work for me in this case and it removed all of the tension that was in Battleline.

Nice game, and well balanced and clever as you'd expect from a Knizia game. For some reason, I didn't like this one quite as much as Scarab Lords. Probably a combination of inferior physical quality of the cards, the art, the theme, and the balance.

Decent 2-player filler game. Tough decisions to make at every turn and the twist in the victory condition with the losing player being the one who finishes his cards first keeps the game tense.

Very dissapointed with this game.  Even though Reiner is credited for the design of it, it looks to me that Kevin Wilson actually 'Developed' these cards.  With the total unbalanced cards, I wouldn't have thought Reiner would get this past playtesting.  It shouldn't be promoted as a Reiner game.

Four plays. There is a mistake on the horde cards; their text should read "...in this column." Also, be sure to read the text of the "High Priest of Rogoth" cards carefully. It's a good game, but I like the decks in Scarab Lords better; too much in Minotaur Lords depends on your cards coming out in the right order, particularly with the red deck.

My rating would be at least a 6 as I like the idea of this game, but the blue faction is by far superior to the red one (blue will win 9 out of ten games because of that horde bonus). Therefore the game is not good balanced. And if an asymmetrical 2player game is not greatly balanced there is no reason to play it.

The same game as "Scarab Lords" with new factions. It's nice that the decks are interchangeable between the two games, adding variety to the matches. I'm just a bit annoyed by the fact that the production is inconsistent with both editions of its parent game: generic Silver Line plastic tray and inferior card quality from first edition, but wooden pieces and card backs similar to second edition.

I just found one side easier then the other.  Somewhat unbalanced, but not completely.  I suppose with more experience they may equal out, but I don't like games where a beginner has such a handicap.

I don't like the compounding effect of the "piling-on suckage" (you're weak, so I'll make you weaker); but other than that, it's rather clever and doesn't wear out its welcome. I look forward to trying out the deck-building aspect, though to be frank I don't see it adding an awful lot to the game.

Played once, was not a big hit. The game lacks emergence, there is nothing that really surprises during the game. You just go through the motions: prevent opponent win via supremacy, and either fail with bad choices or card draw, then player who managed better card drawing/deckmilling will win by the deck exhaustion of opponent. The problem is that the game's structure of power struggle in near equilibrium; it is seems hard (skillwise) or improbable (luckwise)  to make it unequal enough to win, so game 'degenerates' into deck management and feels bland.

Gave away as a prize.

First played June 30th, 2007.  Wow, I had played the Scarab Lords and it was kinda fun.  This seemed aweful painful.  The rules were repetitive, long, confusing and unclear.  Seems it is written to be more complicated that it needed to be and out of order.  The first game play was basically a run through of how to play and get comfortable with it and the mechanics.  It played in about 15 minutes for us.  The second time took a bit longer, however I was still referring to the rules too much for it to be enjoyable.  At this point, I would not recommend it to anyone unless you are a glutton for punishment (which aparently I am after two plays).  Reminded me of Settlers of Catan card game in that I was looking up the rules too much.  It also doesn't help that each card is different and you have read the text on them to figure out what they do and when to use them.

Wow.  Finally played this game right and what a difference.  With the errata employed as well as the much important missed rule about winning when having a majority in both cresents at the BEGINNING of your turn, it makes for a much improved game.  The decks seem to be pretty balanced and the cardplay is interactive and rewarding.  The length appears to be just about perfect for a single game.

Update:  Ok Ok, so I've been playing this wrong a whole bunch of different ways on a whole bunch of different occasions.  I still think Blue Moon is the much superior form of this game.  Minotaur Lords and Scarab Lords suffer mainly because luck of the draw can easily oust you from the running or hand you the victory on a silver platter.  Minotaur Lords is better than Scarab Lords however, as cards are unique to each deck and also aren't as severly chaotic and in some instances, overpowered.

This game is on par with Scarab Lords - they're both enjoyable.  Again, I'm not a big fan of the artwork, which is kind of geared towards adolescents, but the game is fun, a nice tug of war contest.  Each deck is definitely made to be played in a certain way - one is full of high numbers that come out with a curse on them, the other a bunch of low numbers with some special powers to keep you competitive.  I'd like to experiment more with both Minotaur Lords and the base game, I think they're pretty good 2-player games.

Much better than the Blue Moon series IMO. Is really a lot of fun if you have Scarab Lords and 4 players to play tournement style. The decks are interesting in that that all have matchup problems with at least one other deck.

The sideboarding mechanic is pretty cool too. (Each game ships with a neutral deck that each player may use to side in cards. Adds quiet a bit of strategy to experienced card floppers.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This 2 player game was extremely fun.  The game jumps back and forth a lot and strategies can be destroyed by a single card.  Mixes nicely with scarab lords though hordes do seem a bit powerful against the scarab cards.

The only real problem I have with this game is: it's way too flippin' fast! The first time my roommate and I played this, it was over before we even had a clue to what we were doing. Rechecking the rules and actually implementing supremacy bonuses slowed the game down a bit, but still, it's a zooming game! For the amount of cards available to use, it feels like the game should take longer to play. If I missed something somewhere in the game play, that's my fault and I will re-rate this game if someone points out where I've gone wrong.

I loved and still love Scarab Lords, so buying this one as soon as possible was a no-brainer for me. The game components have  improved quite a lot (wooden domination markers, better cardstock, ...), and the errata of the horde ability makes this just as well balanced and excellent as Scarab Lords.

05/14/06 Played once, as red. My opponent (blue), played first, plopped down four phase 0 cards on turn one, gained supremacy in three regions, and... it was all down hill from there. Basically I'd lost before I'd even picked up my initial hand. I've played many games where each side has different initial forces. But never one this imbalanced. These are NOT signs of a good game. I have no intention to ever play this game again. Oh, and the quasi-fantasy theme turns me off too. This is a Reiner Knizia game?!?!

Well, I don't know. I like a lot of what Knizia has done with the game -- the way the phases work and the various card interactions. But I still find Religious supremacy to be way overpowered vs the other two categories, and it's basically impossible to win if your opponent controls both religious columns.

A hugely underrated game! I used to play it for a couple of years with my fiancee and we had a blast each time. The two factions available in the game are totally different and have their own unique feel - one certainly has to understand their strategies and dirty tricks to be fully aware of the possibilities they have up their sleeve (and these are abundant to say the least). We also used to play the game in combination with "Scarab Lords" which adds two more factions (unfortunately, these two are quite similar to each other, but I still recommend playing with the whole set as it adds a whole new flavor to "Minotaur Lords"). To sum it up: although it hasn't hit the table for some time now (due to Warhammer: Invasion taking over its place), I still regard the game as a truly rewarding two-player title.

Es igual que Scarab Lord. La misma mecanica de juego pero mazos distintos. La diferencia de puntuacion se debe al total desequilibrio entre ambos mazos. El azul gana siempre, y aplicamos bien lo de la horda!

Typical brilliant CCG-esque Knizia design.  Simple gameplay coupled with elegant, thematic card design.  One must, of course, be tolerant of bad card draws or a slightly OP deck, as with all CCGs.  For $5 or four times that, this game is a STEAL!

A Knizia take on an asymmetric deck battle game (a la Harry Potter TCG or Star Wars: tCG). Weakened by only having two deck principles, but the addition of Scarab Lords makes for better prospects. Plays very quickly (some might say too quickly), so repeat/reverse match-ups are no problem. The birth-of-civilisation theme is oddly appropriate in true Knizia style.

A card game with a fantasy theme that is easy to learn and quick to play.  One doesn't need to care about the theme to enjoy the game as it is essentially abstract in nature.

The "Lords" series of games is much closer to a CCG in play than Blue Moon. The two games (in the Lords series) comprise four decks that each play differently and require knowledge of the types of powers and the possible combinations of the various powers. The advanced rules push the Lords series over Blue Moon for depth. This is not an easy game to play well; it requires considerable thought.

With the errata the game works, so my rate is now higher. The artwork is ok, but Scarab Lords' one was better in my opinion; same thing for the cards' cardboard: these new Fantasy Flight's cards are not the same old quality...

RATING: 7
Nice 2 player card game, fairly clever in how the 2 decks interact. Very competitive and quick (perhaps too quick), you can easily be doomed by a poor card draw. Like the asymmetrical decks (it does look like blue is the easier side to play). Definitely need the faq clarification/correction on the horde cards to be restricted by column. 
To have similar decks could use the white bonus with a 6 extra red minion cards, may try that for an alternative.

Also would like to try the advanced (best 2 out of 3)

RATING: 6
This is a clever little card game for sure, but there's not much variety to spice it up.  First, there's only two decks...and even those are comprised of only about 8 or 9 different card types.  Contrast this to a game like Blue Moon, where even in the base set, every card is different...every time I play THAT game it's like a completely different experience.  I can't say the same for Minotaur Lords.  Perhaps when combined with Scarab Lords this game might warrant more consideration, but as a stand alone, I can see it getting old rather fast. Plus the artwork is rather "eh".

I'll have to check the boards on this one. We played about 6 games and the red player came close to winning once. Once, that's it and he still managed to lose. It seemed incredibly lopsided in the Hordes favor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not nearly as good as its sister game Scarab Lords.  The horde cards tend to produce one sided games and make deck refinement obvious and constrained.

With the printed cards, blue is overpowered (horde counts all cards in play).  With the errata, blue is weak (horde counts cards in same column).

The red building combos are swingy too -- if you have the combo to not get curses on huge buildings, you dominate.  If you don't, you get crushed.

All in all, this game introduce mechanics that embody what I dislike about synergy-based card games -- synergies that are prescribed for you up front rather than flexible or emergent.  I feel like I'm watching a game unfold rather than actually playing it.  In contrast, Scarab Lords has none of those issues and is superbly tense.

Lastly, the rules for mixing Minotaurs with Scarabs are weak -- they actually destroy the catchup mechanic!  Since you can only take new cards from the same-color neutral deck, there is no interaction with your opponent.  Also, so going first on refinement (the consolation prize for losing) vanishes!

PLAY SCARAB LORDS INSTEAD -- IT'S AWESOME!

RATING: 6
The decks are slower but more powerful than Scarab Lords.  Still a good game to play with my wife.  The more I play this game the more I like it.  Mostly because it can be "combined" with Scarab Lords.  We play where we each player gets a box of both Scarab Lords and Minotaur lords, then we make our own decks from the cards in both boxes.  We sleeve the cards so you can not tell which set eack is from.  A kind of "sealed" deck format for Scarab and Minotaur Lords.  We really have a good time playing it this way.  Always played with Scarab Lords.

RATING: 6.5
A 2 player "tug-of-war" card game...maybe even "chess-like" with two asymmetrical factions vying for control over 6 regions. Unfortunately, luck of the draw can hamper any well thought out strategy (as in most card games right?). Also, the main winning condition (supremacy) can swing wildly from one side to the next on each player's turn, so it's difficult to determine whether a player is poised for victory (or defeat). That aside, once you familiarize yourself with the cards, it's a quick and fun power struggle for two players.

This is another version of the game Scarab Lords.  The games can be combined, although I've never tried this.  The biggest difference seems to be that the two players do not have identical sets of cards.

See my comments for Scarab Lords. Minotaur Lords and Scarab Lords together gives you 4 pre-constructed decks to choose from, giving the game heaps more replayability. It would be great to see the planned, but never published, 3rd "Lords" game in the series to give it even greater depth and replayability.

What an appaling FFG misprint (Horde only work within the column they're in, not across ALL horde cards).

With that rule, this would be a totally different game to what we played 3 times, but I could still see a lot of promise here.

An interesting little 2 player card game that feels ahead of its time.

Interesting, but not interesting enough to be played when so many similar games exist.  At first it seems like a game where you try to get neat card combos, but often you are pretty limited in options each turn and it feels difficult to make any sort of impact on the state of the game.

Nice little game that scratches the Magic: The Gathering itch without breaking the bank. I like the two starter Minotaur Lords decks a tad better than the two Scarab Lords decks. I definitely need to use the advanced rules a bit more and explore the powers of the bonus decks, and I'm looking forward to pitting the Minotaur Lords decks against the Scarab Lords decks to see if my inital assumption that the Minotaur Lords decks are  bit more powerful is correct.

Scarab Lords and Minotaur Lords are two wonderfully synthetic games. Rules are not immediate but anyways are easy (but the first 4 games i played with one fundamental rule wrong and I couldnt understand the game finale) so read carefully!
It is fast enough and it begs for another chance immediately. You have more than one strategy to follow, you can mix decks to enanche ad libitum the longevity and it allows you to use a lot of fantasy. A great game with two titles. ML is a tad better because the two decks are very very different while in SL the decks are pretty similar.

Played a few times - unfortunately without the correct errata rules regarding the Horde cards, which definitely marred the experience. It is really similar to Scarab Lords in its rules, although the decks play probably differently (just like both decks here are fairly asymmetric - I can't comment on balance because of the wrong rules I played with). Overall, a quick, pleasant game with a non-collectible Magic feel.

Blech! Can't stand the negative reinforcement curve of the game -- once you gain an advantage, the disadvantage forced on your opponent is withering and difficult to surpass. The incredibly limited access to cards makes curse control overly powerful, as you can easily find turns where you can literally do nothing about the current game situation, and simply give your opponent more opportunities to sink you further. Dreadful game.

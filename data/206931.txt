LIKE: Some interesting decisions here, do you go for the high-point columns or the colors, and how to mitigate high rolls versus low rolls. Towards the end of the game, low rolls are more valuable. Some possibilities to block other players.

DISLIKE: The dice are random, extremely luck dependent especially when racing another player to complete a bonus. End game can take some time when players are rolling and passing each turn-- although, this does allow players behind to catch up.

OVERALL: For what this game is, a "yaztee meets gem rush" game, it is good. Great for non-gamers, but fun enough for experienced gamers. Heavy gamers? No, not at all.

RATING: 4
Roll some dice, choose a colour and number pair, cross off a matching area adjacent to a previously crossed-off area on your sheet.  Cross off a column or all of a single colour and score points.  What cleverness there is lies in getting to the outer, higher scoring columns before your opponents.  Not so much a game as an activity to keep you occupied for 20 minutes.

This is a decent roll and write, although my rating is gradually dipping with each play. I've only tried it with 2 and while it plays fine, I'm not sure there's enough competition over completing columns/colors. Play time also feels a hair too long for the type of game.

RATING: 3
Another game in the genre of rolling dice and marking off something on a scoring pad. Unfortunately this game is not as good as the others I'm familiar with. It far overstays its welcome because of the rule that only in one area may be drawn. Sooner or later you end up with small bits and pieces which just don't get filled until you roll the appropriate numbers yourself (as other players will take them first to solve the exact same problem). Saving up on the jokers for this crucial aspect just lengthens the game because you will pass more often. The other such games with custom score pads tend to [i]end[/i] at some point where the game is still fun. Not so Noch Mal! So in that the title is really not chosen very well.

RATING: 6
Game took a little longer than I was expecting at 20+ minutes (with rules I think) for a 2 player game. Good game but the box says 1-6 players and I doubt I'd ever really want to play with more than 3 or 4 as not having the first pick would probably kinda suck and everyone having to wait to really make a decision until 1st player picks might make the game even slower. I'll try it with a higher player count and see what happens but I'd hate to play a 30-45 minute roll and write dice game.

Rating a 6 but would probably rate a 7 for 2 player games.

RATING: 9
By the hands of the in-form designers Inkus and Markus Brand, Noch mal! is a gem of a short and sweet dice game. It is a little like Qwixx in the Bingo-style way you cross off areas of the grid to try and be the first to clear rows or blocks of colours. 

It plays upto six in 20 minutes and, like Quixx, there is always something to do on everyone’s turn. 

This has become my families go-to game (and they are not gamers) of 2017.

A great filler.

Another entry in the quickly expanding genre of dice fillers with score pads. This one tends to run a little longer than cousins like Qwixx or Qwinto, partly because there is a little more to consider, partly because it doesn't have an alernate game end condition on failed throws. An okay filler for occasional plays but it doesn't quite provide the stimulation that its name wants to make you believe.

A neat roll-and-write game where you combine colors and numbers to cross out adjacent spaces on the player sheet. Can feel a bit like a minesweeper maze. You get points for completing all the spaces of a color and columns, but there are also a lot of spaces that take points away, which creates most of the game's choices.

Noch Mal ist ein einfaches Würfelspiel.
Wer an der Reihe ist würfelt alle 6 Würfel (3 Zahlen- 1-5+Joker und 3 Farbwürfel, gelb, rot, grün, blau, nochwas und Joker).
Der aktiver Spieler sucht sich nun eine Kombination an Farbe und Zahl aus und kreuzt entsprechend viele Kästchen auf seinem Blatt ab. Immer angrenzend oder beginnend von der Startreihe, ausserdem nicht mehr, aber auch nicht weniger als der Zahlenwürfel angibt! Alle anderen Spieler dürfen sich aus den verbliebenen Würfeln eine Kombination heraussuchen und abkreuzen. Sobald ein Spieler eine Zeile komplett gefüllt hat, erhält er Bonuspunkte. Wenn ein Spieler 2 Farben komplett abstreichen konnte endet das Spiel und die Punkte werden addiert.
Sehr schönes Spiel für zwischendurch... Könnte eines werden, bei dem ich nen Ersatzblock bestellen muss, auch wenn der ziiiiiiemlich dick ist und für viele, viele Partien ausreicht ;)

My wife likes it but I like Qwixx more. For me it takes a bit too long for what it is and the end keeps on dragging forever as you're trying to roll 1s. There should have been some built-in limit that if you can't cross-off something, that you would need to cross-off a penalty like in Qwixx.

[b]Noch Mal[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Surprisingly this is the dice game that's been played more even though I originally enjoyed Dice Stars more. I think the reason is that Noch Mal is a bit breezier, making it more suitable for those times you just want to chill play a quick filler. That's not to say there aren't decisions to be made, but it is a more straight forward game than Dice Stars. I would compare the weight/decision space found in Noch Mal to Qwixx, whereas I'd compare Dice Stars to Qwinto. There are also new score pads [i]([thing=232901]block 1[/thing], [thing=239154]2[/thing] and [thing=239155]3[/thing]) [/i] that add variety to the game and are definitely harder to fill in than the original score pad. I'm surprised Noch Mal hasn't been released in English, it is definitely one of the better roll and write games I've played.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]The second dice filler released at Essen that I picked up. Both Noch Mal and Dice Stars both play differently than the other dice fillers I own. Noch Mal has a strong spacial element which drives game play (as does Rolling America although the actual game play is quite different). 

Scoring has a race element to it since the first person to complete a column or color will score more points. Unlike a lot of these types of dice fillers there isn't a negative end game condition meaning the end game can drag a bit as you are desperately waiting forever a certain die combination to be rolled. I prefer games like Qwixx where you are punished for not using your dice since this not only forces you to use your dice, but also moves along the end game condition. Until I played a few games were the end dragged a bit I was much higher on the game, but when a filler game outstays it's welcome it starts to become tedious.

While neither Noch Mal or Dice Stars are hard to learn, Noch Mal is the more intuitive game for people to pick up. Similar to Qwixx there is almost no rules overhead, but unlike Qwixx there is the possibility of Noch Mal out staying it's welcome.[/i]

I did not enjoy this roll & write dice game much at all. It's got that irritating level of interaction where you would definitely benefit from knowing what other players are doing, but that would involve poring across the table at small writing on their individual note sheets. It also has the undesirable property of getting less interesting as it goes on (it becomes hard to fill anything in as your choices get constrained) and we were all ready for it to finish well before it did.

Another good roll-and-write filler that keeps you involves on other player's turns.  It's basically a race to finish all the boxes of certain colors or rows, try to get all the stars, and minimize the number of wilds you need to take.  There's interesting spatial dynamics of filling in certain areas to allow to reach other needed sections. There can be some interesting player interaction from getting to remove 2 dice from the pool the other players get to choose from, especially later in the game when they have fewer options or forcing them to take wilds.  And there's some interesting decisions about when to use a wild or not.  I think this adds a different more puzzley twist on the more push-your-luck roll-and-write games that are out there.  A great alternative to the likes of Qwixx and Qwinto.

tl;dr: [thing=131260][/thing], but different

This year there were a lot of Qwixx like games. Roll dice, cross off numbers/colors/whatever on a score pad. It seems like every publisher is trying to cash in on that hype. I never thought Qwixx was a great game, but it is a very effective filler that is enjoyable. And this game does the same thing, but different. So it doesn't really differentiate itself, but if you want more of the same but different, this is a solid option.
The fact that you can't loose points for not crossing off makes this game a bit friendlier. I also appreciated the planning nature in the way you have to cross off.

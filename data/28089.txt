Great children's game (for now, I think it's my favourite)... Very clever. 
Must tweak  some rules (laying the sliding cheese pieces on the board) to diminish the unbalancing luck of the setup and the way the pieces are stored back in the box, because it can get a lot difficult to manage.

It would get another point if it wasn't such a pain to put away. Imagine if after every game you had to put the counters back into the sprues they came from. Other than that, its a fine memory game with a bit of spatial movement and meaness.

A beautiful game that kids and adults can both love. I think this really must be played with 4 to truly appreciate the game. I'm so glad I traded for this, as I don't know if I would have purchased it outright. If you are looking for a light hearted game with some fun tactics, pick it up. And don't forget to make cheesey jokes while you play!

Huge fun!  It has to be one of the best kids' games out of there.  Elements of manipulation and passageways, like 3D Labyrinth, only it's much more interesting than that.  Also elements of Akaba in the set collection and memory aspects.  It can be very mean but enjoyable to drop someone else's mouse into the dungeon, but be careful who you pick on - some younger kids might get very upset!  

It's deliberately hard to keep a track of what's going on, which adds a lot of tension - and I love the action points system which is great for kids learning the fundamentals of German-style games.  

And the mice are realy cute and the game lovely to look at!

Superb children's game that adults will along playing along with, or sneakily playing by themselves. The ability to make opponents mice fall through holes by sliding pieces under the ground, plus the tactics of getting tow of your mice on matching pieces of cheese, make this game a sure fire hit. One of teh best children's games out for a long time.

RATING: 7
Just a fun game!  I like the layered board, with the roofs denying some information and the movable squares providing a dynamic board.  I like the mouse pieces – mildly detailed and just fun-looking.  I like the memory element – probably the strongest indication that it's primarily a "kid's game."  I like the strategic nature of the choices: moving a mouse, uncovering a roof or sliding a square (once/turn) – probably the strongest indication that it's more than a "kid's game."  I like that it plays relatively quick.

I rather enjoyed this one and will have to pick it up at some point.  There's a distinct puzzle feel to it, though there's not much opportunity for long-term planning since other players affect the board between your turns.  Quick, easy & fun!

Neat game with memory and strategy aspects.  Played a few more times with the kids, and I'm starting to see how it could be a bit deeper in strategy than I orginally thought.  Rating may go up with more plays.  (The one downside to the inventive board is the set-up time).

[Children's Game]
The best looking kids game for adults that I own. No doubt this one is aimed at kids but I'm sure my adult gaming friends would be just as interested to try it. It combines an action point mechanic with a memory component and the moving board element from Amazing Labyrinth all wrapped up in a set collection mechanism. As a kids game this one offers plenty of 'Ah Ha!' moments as your kids discover the variety of things they can do with their actions. As an adult game the different actions allow for some surprise turns. The only problem with this game is you have to be very careful how you put it away since the 'insert' is actually part of the game. The only game I know of that essentially requires you to own the expansion just to put the game away!! And the mice are VERY nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Here is my storage solution that works GREAT. Take a pair of scissors and cut the bottom 1" out of all the mousetrap tube things. Yes, I said cut (ie. destroy) part of the game component. But once you do that you've made it three times easier:

1) You don't have to completely destroy the board to get the pieces out when setting up the game and then have to rebuild the board. Instead you just lift the insert out because...
2) You can easily store all the parts in ziplock baggies under the plastic insert. There they neatly sit awaiting a new game. You don't need tweezers or tiny fingers to get the pieces out of the little holes that you crammed them into.
3) Finally when a mouse falls down the hole and the game is over and you want to play again you can simply recover the mouse by lifting the insert out. Since the tubes all had the bottoms cut out you'll find the mouse in the box. No more having to destroy the board to tip it upside down to recover 1 little mouse. 

Tada!

An interesting take on Amazeing labyrinth's sliding tile mechanism.  The game plays incredibly fast, and I actually liked the "fog of war" aspect to covering part of the board.  I also liked that you can play slightly cutthroat by forcing your opponent's mice into the dungeon.

A delightful game that is easy to teach and play.
Storage is somewhat meddlesome, but I think the expansion handles that.  Now if someone would just publish the expansion in the US.

Very nice childrens game which can really challenge the adults a bit. The memory aspect is the greatest advantage for the younger players. Beatifully produced and great fun to play. A real nightmare to store in the box.

Biggest problem with the game is that while you are building up the game you see where everything is. This kind of ruins the exploring and memory aspect of the game. Also building up and storing the game after play is just too much work because of the box design.

(KIDS) A cute little game, but not overly simple.  It has a labryinth feel to it with a bit of take that.  First play was with my kids and they thought it was neat... I wouldn't mind trying this game with adults.

Second play with my kids and it works but the tactics are a bit too much for them to be competitive.  They really like the trap doors!  Beaten by my 5 year old daughter on my third play.  I'm liking this game more and more.

Finally played this game with just adults and it worked quite well.  This is a quality game all the way around.

Beautiful, fun, and short -- all qualities I look for.  End result is a bit random but that doesn't bother me.  It is a children's game after all.

The only complaint I have is the packaging.  I need chopsticks to get mice and tiles from inside the pits.  The expansion is unfortunately necessary for a storage solution (and, unfortunately again, not available on these shores).

RATING: 5.5
A very intense and cutthroat memory game.  The board consists of a grid of movable tiles reminiscent of Amazing Labyrinth, and the box bottom is utilized to elevate the board, adding a 3D effect and allowing melees to fall through holes in the roof (board).  Unfortunately, it still feels like a children's game, albeit a very intense one, and I don't have a strong desire to play this type of abstract/memory game when there are so many good Euros/strategy games that we could play instead.  EXPN... The 5th player name the game a bit longer but not by a lot.  The rules for the moveable tower (5th player start location) really need to be explained better in the rulebook.  We didn't play with Cheesy.

Cute little game the reminds me a little bit of Amazing Labyrinth.  Move your mouse around an ever-changing board frought with potential traps, but also delicious, delicious cheese, which of course makes it all worth the risk!

A bit of memory involved in this one, which I'm generally not a fan of, but the game is still fun moving your mice around to find the ever moving cheese while avoiding falling into the mouse traps!

Played this with my 5 year old and while it took a few turns helping her through the actions she eventually got it. Naturally her favorite part is sliding the tiles hoping to catch a mouse in the dungeon which she does fairly well. It's a bit fiddly with setup and always replacing the roof tiles, but the theme comes through so much more compared to other Labyrinth like games that this may be the one to keep. Very charming game!

This might be her favorite game, she is vicious with sliding the tiles around and will always go to eliminate me over collecting cheese. I've taught her well!

Decent kids game of guessing where pieces of cheese are and running around the top of a castle.  It's pretty fiddly for a kids game, though, which may make it tough to grasp for the younger set.  Has a very high "toy factor" and is a cool looking setup.  My kids tend to play with it without playing the actual game.  The gameplay might be grasped by kids older than the theme is luring in.

RATING: 6.5
This game lives up to the quality and track record of the Zoch line. I love the components, the playful theme, and the game mechanics are age-appropriate for a young gamers game. (Sometimes "children's games" are just..off.)

It plays in about 10 minutes, is easy to teach, and the memory element isn't too terribly high. There is ultimately a lot of luck...but that's also desirable in a children's game.

My only quibble is that it a bit of a pain to get the components to fit in the box comfortably in the box again for storage. Its not hard, it just take some time. 

Overall, one I'm glad to play with the kids any time, and not made redundant by anything else I already have.

Has been fun for the family - the kids love sending the mice down into the dungeon (but they hate it when it happens to them).  My 4 y.o. daughter is a little young for this one yet - she just likes to slide the tiles.  My son enjoys it, though it's not one he requests frequently.  I like the memory aspect and how it is teaching the kids to think a few steps ahead.
Edit:  I'm enjoying this game more the more often I play.  Cheesy Gonzola is a good expansion - not only because it provides (finally!) good storage for the base game!

Great game for initiating kids into the wonders of gaming. Has some neat tactical elements and some strategies are higher risk for higher gain than others. But will the riskier strategy mean you lose three of your mice and therefore the game before you can collect four cheeses?

Games have a little set up time and is would be good if there where a way to set the board up without anyone knowing where the pieces/traps are, but this is not a big problem as the board changes a lot during the game.

Best of all is the fairly short length of the game meaning kids don't get bored and want to play again.  This game is probably playable between adults as well, I find it enjoyable anyway!

Though i belive this is fixed by the expansion cheesy gonzola.

A simple and clever game of mice collecting cheese. Each player has four mice. If two of a player's mice occupy squares that house the same cheese type, a corresponding cheese icon is collected. Getting four of the seven cheese types, wins the game.

 As in [gameid=13308], the game box becomes the board; in this case a castle. Roof sections are placed on top of the castle after various types of cheese, blank floor sections, and holes have been placed. In the player's turn, she may use four actions of her choice; uncover a section, move a mouse one square, or slide the floor. Sliding the floor works in a similar fashion to [gameid=1219]; sliding the spare floor section in one end, slides all pieces in the row over one. Cheese can be slid under your own mouse or away from an opponent's mouse. The trick here, too, is that a hole section can be slid under the opponent's mouse. If a mouse drops down into the castle, the mouse is lost for the remainder of the game. 

I'm sure this is great for kids, but as an adult, I really enjoyed it too. It takes less than half an hour and the rules are simple enough for anyone to play. Another kewl title from Zoch.

Very cool game with quality components (the cute little mice is a huge hit with the kids). 

There is much more planning involved than you would think at first as you're only allowed one slide per turn. There's is a memory aspect too, but you can play and win without remembering where all cheeses of a certain sort are. I actually think this would even work as a game for grown ups only and would be a much more evil game then. 

Get the expansion for even more fun.

Players control a tribe of mice, scuttling around a chateau hunting cheese.  Players take four actions a turn, which can be a combination of "revealing" (lifting the roof sections of the chateau to reveal the cheese), "moving" or "sliding" (pushing the cheese segments around).  Cheese is claimed if two mice are situated on the same type of cheese.  Great kids/party/memory game, plays very well, and looks amazing with the gamebox/board combination.  Excellent game.

This is a really neat set collection game featuring an ever changing roof.  It plays like Labyrinth, but the tiles that you move are partially covered therefore unless you have a great memory it's hard to keep track of where the tiles you need are.  Very neat idea.

Played 2 x 2 player games.  I don't know if I was tired, or if the memory aspect of the game is quite a challenge.  I tried explaining this game to my 8 year old son, and after about 2 minutes, he had that "glassy" look in his eye.  This is a game which I think is should be rated for those over 8.

Who doesn't like collecting cheese?  This is one of those wonderful games Zoch has designed to play using the box with layers of cardboard making up the playing surface.  Roofs are removed and your cute mice scamper across the floors, attempting to get to the cheese.  Land two of your mice on the same cheese and collect that cheese.  However, on one's turn you can MOVE the floor for a whole row, possibly putting a mouse into a trap!  Fun, but as some have said, it can be nasty and therefore less good as a kids' game.

Initially traded for this so play with the daughter however every adult I have introduced it to really enjoys it too.

Really simple game premise, you need to have two of your pieces on the same cheese to collect it, but with the hidden information and the moveable floor there is quite a lot of tactics to this. 

Really really enjoyable.

The only downside is the components can get stuck in the insert occasionally and require little fingers to get them back out.

RATING: 7
Nice fun game, quick and tricky enough. A cross between Labyrinth and Memo, it's nicely done. I played this at Beyond Monopoly!, the copy donated by the publisher. *** Played again, and this time it was very cuthtroat. It was fun, but we concentrated hard and tried to catch mice in the holes. We also played with the little expansion and that worked well too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Cute, clever, and well-made.  To store the game away you have to set the board game up, then to play it you have to tear it apart to get to the pieces in the bottom, then set it up again to play which is a nuisance, but I guess no more of an aggravation than lots of pieces in baggies.

I like the element that dropping someone into a mousetrap might lose the game for you if the score is tied.  Good way to start pointing out a more subtle strategy to older kids.

A game of memory which is horrible for me but gives great advantage to my youngsters.  

We created our own variation for 4-5 year olds.  Whenever one of a player's mice lands on a cheese he gets it.  (Instead of 2 of your mice having to be on the same cheese.) First one to collect 6 different ones, wins.

Occasionally the tiles hang up and don't slide properly which at least one or twice each game happens.  Sometimes have to remove the roofs and tear the game apart to line them up.  That keeps this game from being a 7.

EDIT:  I did increase the rating of the game to 6.5 when I got the expansion with the storage tray--the easy storage and resulting easier set up of this game means this game hits the table more often.

Players are mice attempting to grab cheese from various rooms in a Chateau.  The mice must navigate through various room tiles and land their mice on matching pieces of cheese.  However, the board is constantly shifting because player can shift the room tiles, once per turn.  There are several tiles with holes in them which can cause your mouse to fall into the dungeon, taking them out of the game  Finally, there is a memory aspect as empty rooms are covered back up each turn.

Great game for kids 7 and up.  Plays in less than 30 minutes.

The components are GORGEOUS, about as cute as they could possibly be.  The game is pretty simple; on the first play it seemed too easy and the memory element was more or less unnecessary.

First played January 8th, 2008. Taught in ~5min, played in about 25min for 4 players. The game reminds me of stay alive however has much better luck/strategy ratio, in fact it's pretty good. Each player has 4 mice with one in the castle edge. Each player has 4 action points on their quest for cheese. When two of your mice are on the same type of cheese (even on an opponent's turn) you get a slice of cheese. The object is to collect 4 different types of cheese. There are also 3 holes on the board and you're mice will fall through and are out of the game (this would usually happen on your opponent's turn. It cost an action point to: 1) place a mice on one of the four corners, 2) move one space orthogonally, 3) uncover a roof, and 4) move the squares in one direction (only once per turn). The first three options can be done multiple times. You may not land on another mouse however you can move over a mouse. There are roof tiles which vary in shape and must be moved off before you begin your turn. At the end of each turn roof tiles are replaced if no mouse is on the part where the roof was. It's fun enough to play if you know someone who has it, otherwise I wouldn't bother with purchase.

Extremely fun filler with great components. Using an action point system, you move mice to collect cheese through a castle while avoiding mouse traps. It has a memory aspect as one of the actions you take is to remove adjacent roof tops to look under them before you can step into the room. At the end of your turn you have to replace all roofs over rooms that don't have mice in them.

More here than meets the eye.  Four actions per turn is never enough.

Once all 16 mice are on the board the 'memory' element is mitigated somewhat because most of the roof tiles will be off the board.  The game then reduces to a decent tactical battle.

I was pleasantly surprised that the game has gone over well with everyone at our club who has played... and you can't go wrong with the 30-45 minute play time.

The only problem I have with the game is set-up and storage... the box should have been about 1/2" taller.

A great filler worthy of at least a '7' rating.

RATING: 6
Amazing Labyrinth without as much brain burn and a memory element added. Almost too easy to get the cheese at times, the games run very short. Easier than AL, but much, much cuter. There's nothing cheap about the production of this game. The mice are weighty in the hand. Most kids will be enamoured. Adults might be as well, but I doubt they'd ask to play it...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game board and mice are very nicely designed. My kids spent hours playing with the pieces. Mice can move roofs to see the cheese, can move on the board or push a tile into some rows. Moving a tile is usually done to sink another player's mouse which can upset the kids so it is probably best to go easy on them. Two of your mice need to be on the same cheese tiles to collect that cheese. At first I missed that rule and we played so that a single mouse can collect a cheese. That was way too easy so I checked the rules again. When played correctly the game required much more strategy and was a lot more fun.

A neat family game.
I think this one works well from the age of ~5.
You need to combine some strategy with memory skills, which makes it quite enjoyable to play for both adults and kids.

Lovely mechanisms, and works really well with all ages. My only complaint is the fact that you can't easily pack the thing away without dismantling everything, plus fishing the mice back out of the dungeons is a real pain. I'm planning on cutting holes in the bottom of each dungeon (so you can just lift up the insert to get back the mice), plus shortening some of the dungeon tubes (to give space to store mice and cheeses beneath the insert).

RATING: 7
Rating doesn't necessarily reflect a kid's perspective, though I played with the game with children.  I think this is probably due to the fact that either I didn't teach it well enough or they weren't ready to understand the tactics involved in sliding the tiles.

This is a very creative game of clever movement, memory and good old screwage.  I could see how this could be a little too mean for some kids, but if played quickly and in fun it should be fine.  The theme and artwork (like in most Zoch releases) is unique and playful, and the sliding tile mechanism is fun.  The setup and maintenance involved is a little annoying, as the roofs always fall off and when you're done with the game it's very difficult to get the mice out of the holes without taking off every single tile.

This game is a lot of fun thanks to the sliding tile mechanic. It adds another dimension to the game, forcing you to keep multiple plans in mind and needing to adapt depending on what happens during another players turn. Without it the game would be a more advanced version of memory.

With that said, it also means this game is kid friendly. As for the theme, it's also kid friendly and cute but independent of the game play.

My children love playing this. It's a bit like "labyrinth" put more appealing with little mice-figures trying not to fall into the holes. It also has a memory-element in it which gives children an advantage to adults and makes up for the stronger strategy the adults usually have.

Burg Appenzell or Kaas Kasteel is an excellent kids game, enjoyable for adults. Usually, I consider a memory aspect in games as a warning sign of "avoid", but it works remarkably well in this game. Make sure to keep 2 mice and don't have them all chasing cheese in the same quarter of the castle. By the way, getting everything in the box again is a challenge too!

Excellent childrens game. (These are real children games BTW not the ones that end high in the golden geek awards...)
First of all a piece of the cardboard is part of the game so be carefull with that when you punch out the chits.


A total of 4 users have voted this as recommended under 6 years old. My niece is almost 6 (5 years and ten months) and she had some difficulties counting her action points. When she took a different mouse she often started counting from scratch. 
Otherwise she understood the game and was allways eager to play the sliding action even when it wasn't helpfull to her but it is a pretty cool thing to do.

So I would say while playable by a five year old, its a difficult game to play without supervision. And I can't believe most four year olds can play this with other kids by himself. So I would say while the ages on the box are most of the time to high this time they got it right.

Really nice components too. Mouses are comparable with the hedgehogs from Gulo Gulo or the pinguins in the deluxe edition from Hey that's my fish. Not sure of the last one since I haven't got htat in my collection.

I definately would recommend this to any family with a couple of kids where the ages aren't too far apart. I think a nine year old will still like this game. Even I found it interesting to play. Gulo Gulo I found less interesting to play.

So Really good.
 Get it before it's out of print. And remember at least one piece of the cardboard is part of the game.

Great concept. The killer in this game is the set up and tear down. Because the tiles, board, and roof sections stack, it is a PAIN, as the mice and cheese pieces are made to fit into the holes beneath the game board. So setting up is slow. I have started storing the mice and cheese pieces in a separate container. The designers needed to do a better job with storage. For example, the holes do not need to be 2" deep.

The game has alot of bits, but overall isn't all that fiddly. I though for sure that setup and breakdown time would take a while, but even before the first play it took only minutes; and even less time with subsequent plays.

I like the "layering" of the board. It gives a 3d feel that most games cannot relay. I understand that this is a trademark of Zoch games, and this is no exception. From the Mouse shaped tokens, to the holes in the insert that act as the Dungeon to the castle, this game screams flavor. I also have to add that, for those of you that have played it, causing an opponents mouse to fall into a "trap" is as satisfying as getting to throw a piece into the volcano in Downfall of Pompeii.

There is alot of strategy to be had in this fun little game. The modular board also ensures endless variety. I am truely glad that I bought it.

My rating is 7.5 with adults. 9 or 10 when playing with kids. 

This a game that is great for kids as young as 6, especially if the adults don't make full use of the mouse traps while allowing the kids to do so. This can balance the game play so both ages play fully engaged and still have fun without the kids being blown away in a game with such a small luck factor.

It can be a much more challenging game when played with all adults, who are willing to use the mouse traps to their full potential.

Easily in the running for the cutest game on the planet. Looks like a kids' game (and I'm sure it's great for kids), but it's fun for adults, too! If you play this really strategically, the spatial memory aspect is actually quite challenging (remembering not only what roof a particular cheese would have been under, but where it would have shifted to). For a more intense game it might be interesting to reduce the number of "legal" cheeses for a win condition (less serendipitous cheese-under-your-mouse shifting of an unanticipated cheese pair).

This game is everything I want in a kids game. It's easy to understand for kids, yet interesting enough for adults. The game is fun, has great components, and an interesting unique sliding mechanic.

RATING: 5
Clever family memory game of strategy.  Each player controls four mice and can perform four actions per per turn: remove a roof tile, move a mouse, or shift the floor (which can potentially trap a mouse).  The object is to be the first to collect four different cheeses.  Not a favorite of my daughter.

Cute little game for little people, This is one of those games that if you own your 10 years old relatives will ask you to play, and you'll have fun playing with them. But for an all grown-ups group it may seem kind of dull, yet throwing the other players mouse into a trap is always fun!.

Pretty great with just a touch of nastiness that has never upset the girls (3 and 5).  Set-up and tear-down take a bit of time - and figuring out how to rebox it all up afterwards is a game in itself.  Regardless, we like this one a lot.

Picked up Cheezy Gonzola expansion as well.

First impression (4 players) : It's a very good children's game and is suitable for adults too. There is a similar mechanic as in Amazing Labyrinth where you slide tiles but with added memory element. There are roof tiles on top of moving pieces that prevent you from seeing what is under them. Your goal is to get 4 different cheeses. You get them when both of your mice are standing on top of two tiles with picture of that cheese. However, some tiles have holes on them.  Holes are real holes where your mouse can drop (literally) as you use game box as a part of the game. This has one big side effect as you must keep your game components in cylinder shape holes from where they are pretty annoying to take out from when starting a game.

update: You need expansion that takes away most annoying part of the game, setup. In expansion you have places for mice from base game too and can keep them there instead of the braindead solution they had in base game. So must have expansion!

Bellissimo gioco strategico, camuffato da gioco per bambini. Memoria e analisi fanno del gioco una piccola chicca. Con l'aumentare dei formaggi da trovare aumenta la difficoltà del gioco. Il valore aggiunto del gioco è la componentistica, non solo per la qualità ma anche per l'idea di trasformare la scatola contenitrice in castello.

A game about cute mice collecting cheese within Castle Appenzell.  It has the sliding tile mechanic from the Amazing Labyrinth plus action points to lift roof tiles and move. There is also a memory component to this game.  Good fun for adults and kids alike.  Beautiful components.  Got this 27 September 2007 as part of Friendless' combined German games order.

Wonderful components and fun game...but a little bit cumbersome to set up and put away! The mice head into the castle in search of the different varieties of cheese. Match the cheeses and collect the most variety to win! The memory comes from the game board being in 3 layers...with the bottom layer changed during game play! Sometimes pits are created causing permanent traps for your mice!

I think this game is too hard for kids to compete well with adults, not only having to remember the hidden layout, but also having the nous to figure out all the repercussions for moving a row Labyrinth style. It has an engaging theme which lends engagement. For adults, it works and it's ok, but I don't want to play memory games with gamers.

Usually, using the words "kids' game" and "memory element" in the same sentence would send me away screaming, but this one is a winner.  Everything about the game is absolutely beautiful, and the multilayered moving gameboard is both clever and a lot of fun to navigate.  The game is short and tactical; the luck and memory don't bother me too much in a game of its length and weight.

A cutesy looking children's game with a surprisingly dark heart. You can send your opponents mice to their doom.
The game has some memory aspects- need to remember pairs of the same cheese. Action point allowance - 4 points to uncover roofs and move your mice or the board. 
The game box is they play board with 3 tiers - the top roofs to remove, the bottom tiles which can slide to move the board under the pieces, and the middle to hold it all together.

In one game my wife was able to move the board so she could pick up her fifth and winning pair of cheese and at the same moment send my last mouse plunging to his fate. She was most pleased.

One of the most innovative component designs I've seen, especially how the box base and punched frame are utilized to support sliding floor-tiles and trapdoors.

This is a very good children's game, fun for adults too. Founded on the basic memory mechanic, the game adds movement, action-points, and a shifting board to create a game of cat and mouse that can be played lightheartedly or competitively. The great artwork and simple rules (2 pages) help, too. 

I'm becoming a huge fan of the Zoch Verlag productions, having also collected the Medium Box versions of Tobago, Manila, Bausack, Gulo Gulo, Niagara, Hamsterrolle, and others. A common theme, particularly in their children's games, is innovation and ingenius yet simple design.

Initial play - 2P with daughter several games.  As is typical for a Zoch game, excellent components.  But what about the game play?  I find the 4 actions per turn to be enough to allow for some clever moves, but limiting enough to make it challenging.  For example, emptying a room so as to put the roof back to force the next person to spend a point to progress.  Game is simple enough that it was easy to explain to my daughter and start playing.  But has enough thought required to make it enjoyable when played.  I do suspect a bit of meanness is required in the game (throw mice into pits, block certain spots, slide targets away), so will it be played cut-throat?  Or will it be another quirky little Zoch game for the family to enjoy?  Time will tell.  Only downside on the game...nice bits, but no real storage for them as the bottom game box is part of the game.

Óriási funny a játék! :D
Mindig elképedem, amikor egy korábban ismeretlen, de egyszerű, és jól működő mechanizmussal találkozom. Az ahogy a lapkákat lehet tologatni eszeveszettül ötletes! Jó kis kombinatív játék, ahol felesleges az analízis-paralízis csapdájába esnünk, ha 3-4 fővel játszunk. Egyszerűen nem erről szól. Habkönnyű szórakozás, ideális családdal, könnyen elmagyarázható társasjátékokhoz nem szokott embereknek is. A pincébe való lepottyanás, a másikkal való kiszúrás meg óriási derültségeket tud okozni. Nekem nagyon  bejött, szerintem ez nem "gyerekjáték". Habár biztos vagyok benne, hogy a kicsiknek is kiváló szórakozást nyújt.
Külön kiemelném, hogy a grafikus is elemében volt! Nagyon mókásan ábrázolt részletek figyelhetőek meg a dobozon és a játékszabályban is. Sokat tesz hozzá a játékélményhez!

While this may technically be a "children's game", I find that there is more than enough going on here to appeal to adults.  I guess at its base level this is an action point game for kids.  However, the deduction, planning, and opportunities for aggressive play make this a very interesting game for adults.  To be honest, other than the theme, it really seems more of an adult game.  I think I will be picking this one up at some point in the future.  [03/14/2008]

Elaborate board which takes some setup for a family game. It has potential for gamesmanship but the end conditions are such that the game will end without taking too long. It is interesting to see how some people focus on winning the game whilst others focus on taking others down, mainly through the holes that the mice can fall into. Would be better appreciated if the setup were not so laborious.

Chateau Roquefort -- Played twice; four-player.  

Not simply a memory game.  It is both tactical and somewhat strategic.  I say "somewhat" because it's difficult to plan very far ahead when the locations of items near the board's edge can change significantly before your next turn.  The artwork and mouse tokens strike a whimsical feel, the components are high quality, and the board-apparatus is well-implemented.

[9 plays] Very nifty components, delightful fun sending opponents down through trapdoors, simple rules for kids, and enough strategy to keep a parent from falling asleep like an average kids game. If your kids are like mine, expect to have your mice targeted mercilessly throughout the game.

Gorgeous game and fun stuff but a failure as a kid's game. My son was miserable after losing a mouse and only thought of revenge (and he's generally a pretty nice kid).

My new favorite "children's game". Even so, I can't believe I'm rating this so highly - but then I carefully consider the playing the game, and always conclude that I really, really like it! There is a small memory element, but unlike most children's games, Chateau Roquefort does not feature memory as its primary game mechanism. It's really more of a puzzle game based on action points. You can do four things on your turn, including removing roof tiles (to see the location of various cheeses), moving your mice, and sliding the underlying tiles (to move cheese and trap other mice). This game rewards clever tactical play, has gorgeous components, and is equally accessible to children and adults. In fact, it is a VERY enjoyable game for an all adult group. It's quick and in my opinion, slightly heavier than your classic filler. In other words, it is an ideal warm up game. And my daughter is bonkers about it. I want to go play it right now!

A lyukak miatt, ahol egy-egy ellenfelünk egérét tüntethetjük el akár harciasan is lehet játszani benne. 4 egerünkkel próbálunk a várban úgy mozogni 4 akciópontunkból, hogy a körünk végén két egerünk ugyanazon a sajtszimbólumon álljon.

Fantastic production! Love the cute little mice and the way the board is put together -- use the box as castle walls, formed plastic insert becomes the dungeon, with layers of boards to create floors and roofs ... pretty cool!

Game play is straightforward. You get 4 action points each turn. All actions (bring new mouse to the castle, move 1 orthogonal space, remove adjacent roof, slide a tile) cost 1 AP each. SLIDE A TILE: the floor is made of a grid of square tiles, with 3 that have a hole in the center. This is covered by all the roofs. There's 1 tile left after setup, which you can use to slide into the castle from positions on the walls (marked) - this will pop another piece out from the other side, and can be done to slide a piece of cheese under your mouse or to slide a trap under someone else's mouse, dropping it into the dungeon. At the end of your turn, replace any roof pieces you can (i.e., no mouse occupies those spaces). If at ANY TIME 2 of your mice cover the same type of cheese, you take the matching token from supply (unless you already have that type). The first person to collect 4 cheese tokens wins.

So, there is a simple action-point system and some memory elements. It works pretty well, but there is a somewhat big luck component and the memory part doesn't seem very challenging. This would probably be great with kids, but I'm not likely to play it much otherwise.

This is a gorgeous game, but I'm not too sure about the replayability. The action point system may be a bit too hard to grasp for many kids, whereas adults tend to dislike the memory aspect. Beautiful as it may be, I'm not sure many people are willing to pay 35 euros for such a game. But did I mention it really looks great?

Another one from Santa.  Have played this a couple of times with my daughter and some of her older buddies.  Enjoyable game but can get a bit fraught when someone insists on trying to dump everyone's mice down the holes just for the sheer hell of it.

Looks like a kids game but there is some real thinking to do during your turn.
Unfortunately, it involves memory skills which I lack.  Not my kind of game.

RATING: 8
This game is as much for the adults as it is for the kids. I was actually surprised that my kids picked it up and enjoyed it as well as they did, as I thought it might be a little too complex for them. It's got something for everyone, with a combination of action points, memory, and spatial relations, as well as a cute theme and great components.

My only issues with it are the set-up and take-down times and the storage problem. It's also probably not the best game for sensitive kids, as you do try to trap each other's mice.

A great game for kids that causes a lot of laughter when anyone's mouse plummets down into the depths (we wave them goodbye). Can be a lot more tactical with more players. I hate memory games as a rule, but this is the exception.

Only played with adults, but it was fun. Movement points, memory, some passageway sliding (like Master Labyrinth). A race to get your cute mice to collect pairs of cheeses.

Chateau Roquefort has one of the coolest boards I've ever seen.  I love the hidden information/memory aspect of the game as well.  This is one situation where action points work perfectly.  

This one works great for kids but is actually quite fun for adults too.

I'm more impressed by this game than I am of most new Euros.  It's too bad this kind of innovation was used for a kids game.

played 2 times. The action points turn this light kids game into a fun, tactical race for the cheese.  Adults can definitely enjoy this.  There is a dose of luck as you're discovering the cheese and mouse traps under the roofs, but I really enjoy the experience. 2008/06/13

Played with 2- and 4-players, kids and adults. Beautifully produced kids game that takes the main mechanic of the Amazeing Labyrinth and makes it into a fun game. This game has some screwage in it, so be careful playing with kids who can't handle it. Very nice kids game that works well with adults well. Only downsides are set up and storage. Still trying to find a good way to do both.

No memory game can boast higher production values than Chateau Roquefort.  I don't particularly care for memory games--and frankly, I want more opportunities to push mice into holes--but Chateau Roquefort is a good novelty family game, provided that no-one loses a single piece under the sofa (likely).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I think Chateau Roquefort is among the best games for kids, although it's a bit more complex. But that's another reason I love it--it works as an interesting game for both children and adults. Children have fun bouncing around the roof with their mice in search of tasty cheese. While adults have enough to think about in terms of tactical play and competition, that it works for both generations. One more great thing is the memory element, which always works well for kids.

Highly recommended kids' game.

I hope I don't let myself memorize where all of the holes are.  When teaching this game to other people, point out that there are only three tiles for each type of cheese.  This let's them plan a strategy based less on hope and more on exploration.

RATING: 5
Chateau Roquefort was a disappointing game. My expectations were likely too high after hearing such great things about this game and after the announcement that it had won the 2008 Golden Geek for best Children’s Game. It’s actually not a bad game by any means, and my disappointment is principally due to the fact that I hadn’t researched the game enough so I didn’t realize that it had a significant memory element. It’s basically a variant on the traditional Ravensburger game The Amazing Labyrinth where players can alter the location of tiles on a grid by using the surplus tile to push any row or column of tiles on the board, which results in a new surplus tile falling off the far edge of the board. My problem is that you’re trying to find pairs of matching cheese, but the locations are constantly uncovered and then covered back up, requiring players to try to remember where things are located, and to track those things as they shift around the grid. It has wonderful components and a nicely streamlined set of rules which should both make it work fairly well with children, but that last bit about the memory aspect of the game is pretty much a deal breaker for me personally.

Each player controls colored mice and tries to collect pieces of cheese in Castle Appenzell. On their turn, players spend action points to put new mice into play, reveal corridors in the castle, move their mice around the castle, or push a tile into play, which changes the maze of cheese pieces underneath. If two of a single player's mice reach a place with the same kind of cheese showing, the player obtains a piece of this cheese. The first player with 4 different pieces of cheese wins the game.

Played once (with 4 players). A beautiful game with cute little mice and superb cardboard components. It shares some mechanisms with other games, but gameplay is pleasant. A possible problem, though, is that it may be difficult to save your mice once (some of) the hole tiles have been located, which happens quite quickly. I wonder how suitable this game really is for children - there seems to be a lot of rules for young kids, but I suppose it works as a family game.

Excellent children's game. The components are very nice, and playing the game is very dynamic with the moving tiles. I've never had a bad game of Chateau Roquefort. Things to note: the resin pieces are rather fragile, and will break if dropped, and the box insert is awful. Pieces dropped in will be very hard to retrieve, and storage of the pieces when not playing the game is a mystery.

Great negotiation game with a cool theme and mechanics that facilitate interesting interactions.  Only gripe I have with this game is the score board and the jailbreak cards that are over powered with the bonus end game scoring.

Oh the backstabbing. I love controlling the guy that can steal $3 from anybody. Because usually I make someone pay me $1 or $2 to NOT steal $3 from them. Only to still steal $3 from them anyway after they pay me. But it's usually the guy in the lead so it's OK.

I have such fond memories of Kremlin upon which this game was inspired. Mechanically, I'm not sure I like the area control aspect - it has a problem with range because once you invest, you have to continue to do so to retain your previous investment. And it has run away loser problem since you are rewarded by winning areas with more resources to gain further areas. If you get behind in that, you're done for. The card play is pretty good. The rounds are rinse and repeat rounds. It also feels like it plays a bit long. But having said all that, I still like it enough and would certainly play it again! I think it would be great fun with my gamer friends who don't mind swingy take-that games.

Great theme, components and artwork. It could even be a great game, but it's not because it takes itself to seriously. 
It should be fun, but by the fourth round it becomes repetitive and boring. It's just too long for what it is. I expected more control and more meaningful decisions from a 2 hour game.

RATING: 4
A very average game that relies in the meta-game to provide any reasonable fun. If you find the right crowd willing to spend 3 hours of their lives arguing, negotiating and backstabbing each other it might worth considering.

The game itself is a convoluted, chaotic mess. Invest a few plays first before you expect any meaningful experience. Don't expect new players to like this (even if they are hardcore gamers). They will spend most of the time trying to make sense of the dozens of character powers, card effects and arrows on the board. Bringing in non-gamers in this is a recipe for disaster (don't let its social aspect trick you).

Components and artwork are great.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

This game simply is not my cup of tea. It's just negotiation... and I'm not a fan of the mechanism. I know a lot of people actually love it. Yet besides the fact that I don't usually like the mechanism, during this game I felt that all the negotiation was about nothing. It's difficult to explain what I mean, but I'll try to put it this way: I enjoy the negotiation in games, when there's something "actual" of "physical" to negotiate on - for example a territory in a game with war. In Nothing Personal the physical element is almost non existent and I'm not engaged in the game because of that. Furthermore the cards add a lot of randomness. In some turns I couldn't do what I wanted and I was forced to put influence on characters I really didn't care about - at that point I did it "just to play".

Great components, nice artwork... but Nothing Personal it's far from being a game I can enjoy, because it feels to me empty, random and - all together - boring.

RATING: 6
1st play: I really didn't get a good feel for the game in my first play.  We didn't have a ton of table talk, it felt like the plays came down to which cards were drawn at random.  I don't think that's true, because other players were making cool, cutthroat plays, so it may be that I drew poorly or playing with people who had played before was a bigger disadvantage than what I thought.  Look forward to playing again.

No 2nd play: I've had a couple opportunities to pick it again, and never felt motivated.  The game wasn't bad, it just wasn't amazing, and felt a bit long for what it does.

A good game; but it nevertheless feels like it was taken out of the oven too soon.

It's supposed to be a negotiation game: but negotiating is entirely optional, and it doesn't diminish or increase enjoyment of the game either way. The board works...sort of: if one is new to the game, you're going to be frequently walking over to the other side of the table to see what the heck that tiny icon actually says...if it's not covered with influence tokens. And the rulebook? SHEESH! If you really want to learn how to play, read Radio Fyr's review. There are player aids: but they only tell you the bare bones of the mechanics. 

A good game that coulda been a contender for a great game.

The game is great, the social part is its strong point but I can see how easily this game will get a group of friends in trouble.

Personaggio Level Subscription - Copy of Game, Historical Gangsters Pack, Italianized name and caricature on one card $400

... as of August 2013 still waiting for my copy to be delivered as DHL are requesting a massive duty charge of ~ $90!!! This is leaving a very sour feeling ...

... Games Salute finally settled the monies owed (after GenCon) and several chaser emails ... Replacement board stickers have now also arrived (separate application to Games Salute); the "Second Guy" sticker does not cover the existing board text and spoils the aesthetic of the board (the arrows are also too feint to see in low light but that's another issue) ... overall this game has not met my expectations and I've amended my orginal 7 rating down to a 6 (Sept 2013) ...

This game would be a huge hit if it wasn't published by Game Salute and wasn't designed by Tom Vasel. But because he won't promote his own game, and because Game Salute idiotic publishing practices that keep them from ever reaching wide distribution (not to mention they do zero marketing and promotion), this game will remain in obscurity. It's really sad, because this game is easily one of the best games of 2013, with production values through the roof. This is one of the prizes of my collection for sure.

Initial Impression: The components in this game drip with theme. This is an area control game with a large amount of negotiations. Influence placement is greatly determined by cardplay. This results in a potentially very chaotic game with a high degree of bluffing. I definitely need to get more plays of this game to see if it's possible to play this game with a long term strategy, or whether it's all tactical and reactionary.

PLAY TEST 3rd May 2012

First Play: Play test copy obtained for Epsom Games Group by Adam but assembled by Gordon to a very high standard. This was a good start.

First impressions, this is a game that will be enjoyed most by players who aren't afraid to laugh and joke at other peoples expense (including their own) and are of the mind set that most moves can screw periferal payment or the promise of advantage from the other players. You must behave badly and dishonourably throughout. If that causes you problems then forget it.

However crooked my intentions during the game, I never actually felt I was behaving like a gangster or even was supposed to be a gangster. The main reason for this is that the game is effectively an area majority mechanic where you struggle to get the majority influence over 'a gangster'. And that didn't feel right. One minute I had the majority of a 'Guy' and thought I was him, but after a flurry of card play by others I lost control and I wasn't 'him' any more. You could argue that you are maneouvring to influence a character but it never felt like that. If theme is important to you, this theme didn't work for me. Gangsters are to my mind about racketeering, extortion, bullying, you get the picture. But apart from the bribes and deals that we did of own volition (which are allowed by the rules), money is obtained in a very sterile fashion, each gangster just gets allocated a varying amount of cash or the occassional card gives you a windfall. OK some powers let you steal $2-$3 from another player but there is no feeling of grand larceny as you collect the money, its just like passing 'Go'.

Some of the cards do seem very powerful compared to ordinary run of the mill cards and game changing. In two instances players used combinations of two or three cards to build a majority in one gangster only for that preparation to be undone by one player using one Uber powerful card. As these super cards are drawn blindly, I'd recommend they are detuned or removed. Again being dealt a hand where you have no flexibility and you are forced to take actions that do not compliment previous moves is an inevitable consequence of a game with a heavy card draw mechanic. This function can mean the game flow falls in your lap or slaps you in the face.

Hands up I hate dice, but the use of a die in this game is a very crude '1970's' mechanic. Want to whack someone? roll the special die. Want to challenge another position in the family? roll the die. The effect on the game is pivotal if an attempted kill is successful or backfires, but the fact that a die roll has such a huge effect is imho utterly gauche in what should be a far more subtle game. 

Bash (or whack) the leader is the absolute consequence of sensible play. Someone cannot be allowed to get ahead and there are ample opportunities to drag a leader down and the criticism of king making is potentially strong. As this is the essence of the game I think this situation is inevitable. 

In conclusion I think there is the seed of a clever and highly interaction negotiation game here and we did have great fun. I'm tempted to think that the theme isn't quite right and a 'Junta' type political voting backdrop might fit better (the board structure has more than a passing similarity to Kremlin and that theme is better suited). Some cards need to have their teeth filed down and a more controlled mechanic to remove the absolute lottery of the die is essential to avoid destitute losers and run away winners. We have the makings of a good game here but for my 2d worth, it needs alot more work.

Really cool area control-based negotiation game with a mafia theme that works extremely well. You feel as though you are manipulating the ranks of the mob, that you are carefully considering what gangster to recruit to your cause. The negotiation is fun, and figuring out how to manipulate the board to your best interests can be an interesting puzzle to work out. Fun blend of table talk and real strategy.

For all the little rules and things I was afraid of, the board did a great job of having the references right where I needed it.  Vasel knows his stuff when it comes to making a game that teaches itself.

Ez egy rendkívüli játék. Vérbeli maffia hangulat. Látszik a fejlesztők szakértelme, hogy egy igazán jó tematikus és magas újrajátszási faktorral rendelkező játékot készítettek el. A grafika fenomenális, minden kártyán egyedi és a karakterek is hozzák azt a hangulatot amit elvártam. A játék hossza nagyban függ attól, hogy mennyi kommunikáció zajlik egymás között. Egyébként másfél óra alatt lejátszható lenne. A játékban konkrétan minden szabad és bármi megszerezhető, ha van elég pénzed. Zseniális. Csak azért nem tízes, mert az eredeti szabály egy tragédia, de a feltöltött javított verzió az tökéletes. Nagyon nem ajánlott 14 év alatt!!!

This one is fun, I enjoy it quite a bit. It's a take that game with some interesting twists. The idea is to control the mob and call the shots. You'll influence members of the mob in different ways and make deals with the other players. Often just to have them stab you in the back 5 minutes later. A lot of fun, I'd like to have a copy in my collection.

Good components and art but the italic font is not easy to read from the wrong side of the table or from any distance and the bribe markers just vanish in the stacks of influence markers. It reminded me of Kremlin (with the placing influence on a hierarchy of Soviet politicians) but with chaotic and intensely irritating game play and non-secret influence. Planning seems pointless as you can't really predict anything and anyone can place influence on pretty much any character as most of the cards are quite similar. Much too long and procedural for the little amusement it provides.

The amount of chaos can be entertaining, but the chaos is so dominant as to take away from the fun. We found a situation very early on where one player couldn't play cards and had an empty turn. Now that sucks. Too many holes in the rules and the gameplay for me. A noble attempt, but it just shows how hard it is to make a good game and no amount of luxurious components can hide the the holes in it. A really noble effort and a game that has promise.

RATING: 8
Nothing Personal caught my eye as a very neat concept for a game.  You're one of several mafia families vying for control and influence of powerful members inside the mob.  There's bidding, bluffing, backstabbing, recruiting, and reaping what you sow.  

What I like most however, is that you can't just skill your way through the game, you also have to cooperate (and simultaneously compete with)the other players.

I will say that the game has a learning curve.  Players will need to understand a variety of factors going on or you're going to get snuffed (sometimes quite literally) by the competition.  It's also important to understand that whoever is in the lead (in terms of who has accumulated the most respect so far) should always be antagonized or they are going to end up winning easily.  

Because of this feature, the game cannot be played with 2 players.  It's 3-5 and best with 4 in my opinion.  With only 3 players it will continuously be 2 ganging up on 1, and with 4 players things can be a bit more even. 

One of the first times you play this game it will likely take a while to acclimate yourself to what's going on. Later on you might find that games can go pretty quickly.  The are multiple phases within a round of the game, but only 5 rounds total.  

I like Nothing Personal enough that I would play it pretty much whenever it's offered

Tom Vassel took the genius base idea of Kremlin - and made it into a fun to play mobster game. I had a blast playing it. The many tiny written texts on the cards makes it more fiddly to play, then Kremlin - but on the other hand, it offers many possibilities to threat and negotiate with the other players. Definitly needs some "roleplaying" and a lot of bargaining about everything to really reach its full potential!

..was wandering through the exhibition booths at BGG Con last week when I spotted Nothing Personal being demoed.  I was immediately drawn in by the games theme and the various mafia thugs pictured on the cards.  Just to digress a little on themes.  Over the years I've noticed a move especially in the eurogames, towards some very "off the wall" themes and more often than not the theme is only paid lip service by the game.  That's not to say the game is not playable and fun, but it adds so much more, at least to me, and motivates me to learn a game, if there is a closer connection between the game mechanics and a theme that I can get my teeth into.  I also like to come away with a little "inside" feel or even history lesson from the topic covered by a game, however superficial. Ok well this game, to me, pays enough homage to theme IMO.
Another thing I enjoyed was the way it allows dealing between players.  By games end I had collect a lot of cash and was able to start bribing/influencing other players with it and actually finally use it as a pivotal tool during the final turn.

To sum up game sold me with theme, eye candy, intutive feel, and I enjoyed the interaction the game fosters.

Rehashed gangster theme we have seen time and time again, more so then anything Egyptian. Thug themes not a thing I enjoy. Just a boring open negotiation snooze feast, throw in the a pile of screwage, randomness screwage, not exactly entertaining.

Maybe someone should do a review of this dud like this one https://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/25615/shadow-era/dice-tower-reviews-shadow-era and throw a planned, scripted temper tantrum, going after the designer and publisher, it should never have been published, it does nothing for the hobby, nothing personal. Nothing funny, forgiven about that review like many write it off to be.

More of, "I want to be a board game designer", a one off, there just isn't anything shining about this thing.  Reminds me of William Shanter's singing career, you just do it because someone will buy the album on name only. Can anyone really forget Shanter's Lucy in the sky with diamonds?

With this game, not my forte nor my cup of tea.

This game really can depend on your group as to how fun it is.  If your group will really run with the theme and the negotiation, then it's a ton of fun.  But if they just sit there and play but let things happen without trying to negotiate, it can suck.  I love this game and the components and I love the negotiation.  I even like the take that element.

What drags this down is that while it purports to be a negotiation and deal making game, the framework and rules are complex enough that they get in the WAY of negotiating.  Further, the extra randomness through dice and cards, limits what you can do to the point that you spend more time navigating your limitations and the luck rather than the other players.  Sadly this doesn't improve on the genre.

Wow there! I am a huge fan of Tom Vasel and the Dice Tower, but it too me a good year after the release to play Nothing Personal. It turned out I missed a year of great fun. It's one of the best negotiation games I've ever played. And most of all I love the theme and how the mechanisms blend with it. Easily a top 10 (or 15) games of all time for me.

When I first played this game it wasn't with the right group and it didn't go over very well. The second time I played was with a bunch of backstabbing hooligans and the game was great. You really have to make sure you are playing this game with the right people. I would also recommend not doing the full five rounds. Four is enough.

Very fun, altough players must have in mind that there's nothing personal, just business ;-) I mean, not for players that take gaming too seriously as it can induce to conflict.

Nothing bad, a cleaned up Kremlin for the modern gamer. I think i prefer the flexibility and theme of the older game. Kremlin had character, this game has great components but by taking ideas from different games over the past few decades sort of ends up feeling like every other game. The take that card component is also quite strong, through it fits the conceit.

What happens when a guy who critiques boardgames for a living tries to strike out on his own and make one himself (obviously with some help)?  Meh.

Putting aside whose name is on the box, Nothing Personal is an okay game of jockeying for position with a helping dose of chance/luck.  It's not a terrible game, but it's not a terrifically great one, either, which is a shame.

The theme is decent and supports the gameplay although it seems like a missed opportunity when you consider the board is a layout of the mob's hierarchy (mob politics might be fun to explore, for example).  Players represent various factions (or sub families... I guess?) trying to influence members of a small mob by dropping tokens on them via cardplay.  Having the most influence, and therefore controlling the mob member, allows you to take advantage of their abilities and they also end up earning money and Respect just for you (Respect being NP's version of victory pointS).  Mob members - according to their "sponsor's" desires - may move peacfully up the ladder via a toss of the die or be violently killed off and replaced depending on the pecking order.

On paper this sounds all well and good, but the game can be a bit swingy because of the dice, but more because of the cards.  Some cards are extremely powerful and it's all about who just so happened to draw them.  On the one hand, I always welcome randomness, but on the other hand, it's hard to think you're being treated somewhat fairly when you're holding a piddly "place 1 influence" card while the guy next to you gets to plop down 5.  "But the game isn't supposed to be fair!" you say.  Irrelevant!  I'm only saying that hey, even if you have an overall strategy, you're probably more likely to get beat by a random card draw than by another player's skill is all I'm saying.  Whether you enjoy that or not is your prerogative.

So on that note, the game is playable and enjoyable to a certain degree, but you have to go in with the mindset that this is just chaotic fun and not sound strategy.  Like I said, skill won't really be the thing that beats you (to be fair, it will play a part), but rather luck of the draw.

Now let's put that name back on the box - regardless of who it is, it takes a lot of brass sack for a critic to put their name onto a product that they critique.  For the very reason that if it's your job to tear apart a product for the purposes of a review, you ought to (in theory) be the best person to make that product, at least from a design standpoint.  All the things you hold other peoples' work accountable for should not, in principle, play a role in your own product.  This doesn't play into my rating of the game (it's a 6 on its own), but I am disappointed that this game doesn't have a stronger showing.  It goes to show that it's easier to tear something down than to go make it yourself; all critics have this sort of thing going on in the back of their heads and it rarely, if ever, bares the best of fruit.  Should critics not do these things?  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm just saying hey, you hold these things up to the magnifying glass day in and day out; you ought to be boiling your own crap down to an 8 at the least because, of all people, you [i]know[/i] what you want to see in the game and how it ought to work.

I wouldn't mind playing this game if others wanted to but I don't think I would choose to own it or suggest it at a party.
This is a themed game based on influencing mobsters to do your bidding. However, everyone else is trying to put just as much influence on a mobster. The problem is that the bidding, counterbidding aspect of the game is just too backstabby and slows down the more enjoyable parts of the game. It feels a little like Munchkin in which you're always trying to screw over your opponent. Fortunately, there are only 5 rounds so you know the game won't last forever.
I do feel like if you just unluckily pick the wrong mobsters to back you may never get enough influence in the game to make things happen in the beginning and thus your fate is decided early on. 
Rating may change on more plays.

2016-04-05 : Remake of the game Kremlin where the theme matches the mechanics even better than the original. I knew what the game was going in so didn't mind the chaos. This is not a strategy game, good planning is no guarantee for success but bad planning will make you lose it, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Lots of "take that", lots of sudden reversals, lots of moves by your opponents you didn't see coming. This is the kind of game I can enjoy once in a while and the only serious minus point is the graphic layout. This game is crying out for icons on the board and cards, instead we get text that's pretty much unreadable upside down from the other side of the table. Seriously, didn't anyone involved in this project spot this major problem ?

Based only on gameplay...I'm in no hurry to play this again. It's not about the chaotic shenanigans, but the strategies that I think are repeatable and difficult to overcome. By focusing my influence on a limited number of gangsters (no more than 3) and spending every free dollar to "up the ante" I was able to weaken players who either passed or felt compelled to sacrifice cards to play, only making them weaker in subsequent turns. I never sweat a character going to jail or getting whacked, and only messed with other players gangsters when it was a secondary effect of card play or board position.

I had plenty of money, scored more points each turn and had better card choices by virtue of more cards to choose from. If everyone played this way the game might balance, but I think that would make the game stale as it seems that the more risky actions are a distraction from a coherent strategy. Players banding together to slow down one player quickly reveal the next "leader" and around and around we go...all in all this game wasn't a disaster and was worth playing once.

I'll stick with Kremlin, Junta and Dune. IMO each of these games are more focused and rewarding to play.

Lastly, the production issues and some of the font choices are bewildering...most specifically the cursive writing was almost unreadable. So many delightful component choices are undone by poor graphics choices and shameful editing.

Two plays and It's an ok engaging game.  Nice bits, but do not play with the original rulebook, otherwise you will go nuts.  Instead, download the revised rules a BGG user has put together.  Secondly, you need the replacement stickers for board errors, and these need to be mailed from Game Salute. So, 4 weeks later, you can start, and find a game with nice bits, rules with holes and non-obvious solutions, and a long chaotic game where you ultimately are at the whim of dice.  It's an interesting experience with for me a unique mechanism, but not a game that i would say is essential for an essential collection. A 6 rated game as whilst It's an ok game, not sure i will be playing again in the short term (Oct 2013). UPDATE: The desire to play reduces (Rating 5.849, Jan 17)

This game has always kind of been on my radar, simply because it was done by Tom Vasel. But recently I saw some friends play it and it looked like they were having a blast, and you can really mess with other players in this game, which for me of course is a big plus. So I want to try this one now.

I believe this game is quite underrated. I understand that the first edition had a couple of big confusing points in the rulebook, but second edition is free of those.
The artwork and game components are outstanding. The theme is very strong and fun. I don't usually like competitive games and this one is quite brutal in that regard, but somehow the theme and game mechanics just make it fun, in addition to some smart catch up mechanics meaning a game is never won or lost until the last minute.
Quite an enjoyable and intense experience that I'd strongly recommend !

A fun game.  It is driven by negotiation, intimidation, scheming and blunt force.  In other words, it is my kind of game!  The mechanisms support the theme and they help to create both thematic swings of fortune and deeply held game-long grudges.  If that sounds like something you would like, check it out.

A brilliant game about managing commitments that become battlegrounds and then are removed from the game.  Ideally, you can build up some influence on low cards which will then be able to score you Respect without drawing influence wars.  This never really happens.

Great mix of strategy and negotiation.  This negotiation kicks other negotiation games butts.  You can bribe with anything and there are lots of opportunities to do so.  There is also more strategy in this game than a lot of so called strategy games.

Length is an issue.  Can't play with two players.  There are a lot of errors and ambiguity on the rule book.

Much better than cosmic encounter, which is a game I love.

Well, it's okay.
My biggest gripe with this is the discrepancy between a very lucky dice-rolling endgame and a very thinky midgame.

Because in the end everyone just churns out money & cards to either whack or move above opponent-controlled gangsters, because that means a swing of 8! VPs.

So the pretty thinky midgame about where to put your influence becomes kinda redundant. "Why did we just spend 2 hours haggling over every gangster?"

The in-build bribe mechanics are pretty cool, as is the Capo ring. See this as a very long beer and pretzel game. With the right group this is awesome.. 

Also consider just playing 3 or even just 2 rounds.. as it doesn't change the game at all, but makes it snappier.

RATING: 5
This game can be very fun... but that fun will greatly depend on your gaming group. Sadly for me, both groups I tried it with, I left feeling flat.  

I will not fault the game mechanics on this one, but if you play this game like it says without any negotiating, this game will suck. Negotiation is KEY in this game, if you play with static/boring/non-lively/non-outgoing/etc. people, you will hate this game. The game can suffer from a run away leader problem as well as  "kingmaking," where two players will not screw each other over no matter what and as long as one succeeds, they both win in their eyes, resulting in a "2 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 scenario," instead of every man for himself. Bonds are meant to be broken in this game, you step on other people to get to the top and when they expect repayment, you stab them in the back again...that is the nature of the game, but I feel it can lose that quickly if people are not going into this game with that mentality 100% of the time. That's why this game suffers for me, might not be the case for many others, but in my gaming groups it just did.

In Cosmic Encounter, the above strategy can work, where there can actually be 2 or more winners, Hell that would be a great strategy and would make for some fun moments, but here there is only one winner theoretically(unless we include the tie-break where everyone that's tied is the winner if they're tied in 3 other areas....which is also in almost every other game!) Come to think of it, there still can only be one winner in this game. See how this game can suffer? I hope so cause it's really hard to portray in writing.

Now I quite enjoy games like Ca$h N Guns, Bang The Dice Game and King of Tokyo, which are purely 'take that' but the difference between those games is they are technically party games, taking about 20-40 minutes to play per session. Nothing Personal, in both games I played took over 2 hours, and that's only playing 4 rounds, not 5 like it's actually supposed to be. definitely a con of the game, is that it takes too long, and I can only imagine with hyper, super negotiating groups.  

Nothing Personal is an ok game, I see the potential and the fun, hence even with these negative views, but it's just not for me. I'd rather play a long coop game or Cosmic Encounter. It hurts cause I thought I did enough research and I knew the type of game this would be. I thought my gaming groups would love it, but it's just to long for what it is. What's mind boggling is why Tom Vasel would design an overly long, mainly euro-centric, take that game? I know Cosmic Encounter is your favorite game, but come on man!

4 player game was 3 hours of Chaotic area control. Too much down time and decisions feel like they arent impactful or dependent on too much card draw.  It was a little over whelming and just didn't feel streamlined. Too many actions affecting everything.  I tried to go with multiple alliance strategy and bribing and it worked OK but overall just unsatisfying for how long a 4 player game taking 2-3 hrs and ending premature 80% through. It's a bad sign when 1 hour in you just want the game to end.  

Beautiful components but chaotic mess that needs major streamlining.

Designed by the king of board games himself Tom Vasel so the quality is as expected top notch. 

The game itself is also intriguing its more a game between people then a game that occurs on the board its all about deals and back stabbing and climbing to the top of the pile which is what I imagine the criminal underworld is like.

RATING: 5.5
The implementation is very solid and the components are over the top...however I was not super excited during the game. I can't help but compare it to City of Horror, and that game was just so much faster and cut to the bone. There where certainly great moments of alliances, kept and broken, and a lot of laughs and great situations when rolling the dice (great mechanic) and different sides of alliances paying for rerolls. But it had way too much fiddling around with area (gangster) control between those moments. Give me City of Horror or Cosmic Enounter any day

RATING: 10
Meanest game in my collection, and the best negotiation game I know. The turn structure and cards give plenty of reasons to band together and then stab each other in the back a moment later. It also looks great on the table, and the ring is one of the BEST components I've ever seen.

However, I've found the the game should only be played with 4 players - with 5 there isn't enough room on the board for everyone, and with 3 negotiations stall with prisoner's dilemma style issues.

The negotiation serves as the backdrop to a real game here, which puts it as a next step game after Cosmic Encounter. While I liked it, I did find that the cards could be overpowered or underpowered.

A contradiction of gameplay styles is the best way to sum this up.

On one hand, you have a brilliant mechanic like ante-ing up the Influence counters, and calculating your card play. On the other, you have completely random mechanics which create a huge amount of swing (especially endgame). So the first part of the game feels very meaningless because of the second part.

The endgame feels unsatisfying because people who can't win will pretty much just kingmake and sometimes the winner just seems so randomly decided. It takes away from the strategic element of the game.

Nothing Personal is a game for 3-5 players. Players attempt to gain the most respect in five turns (five years) by amassing respect amongst the mafia through influence, negotiation, blackmail and bribery.

Players take turns playing influence cards to take control of gangsters and work them up the chain of power. Each position and gangster has their own special abilities that give players the edge they need to accrue the respect they deserve - to become the Boss of Bosses.

Finally played this, what a disappointment. Warning before your first play: read FAQ!
Kind of late to the party, but I wanted to still give a small warning if you haven't played the game: read the FAQ before playing and all the numerous threads.

I am big fan of the dice tower, and I am really surprised by the type of beginners mistakes in the game. My rating (5) is a bit harsh but it is in scale with my surprise with the lack of professionalism.

First, the rule book is a mess. It is probably In the top 10% worst rule book I read. It's the first time a rule book made me stop and scratch my head at the SETUP PHASE. 
The first sentence is basically "there are 4 suits, make sure that all 5 first gangsters all have a different suit from each other". 
And it goes on on numerous occurrences like this. The game is dead simple, but teaching it took soooo long because of so many useless rules and a rule book way to big and lacking precision .

I have played hundreds of games and I am the one learning and teaching usually, so I am pretty used to it. The worst thing is that I watched all the videos rules from tom beforehand. I can't imagine going into the rulebook with 0 information.

Another exemple while teaching was some rules about negative values gangster. My wife was "wait.. but that doesn't make any sense". I had to argue and enforce this rule, only to discover later in one of my numerous check with the FAQ while playing the game that tom posted "oh yeah we forgot to remove this.. oups!".

And I won't even mention several boards misprints, The total absence of player turn summary (despite a good production value and countless nice but useless extra components). Extra point also for the combat summary board which omits one of the rule (add a neutral token).

The rest of the game is okay. Way too long for what it is, fairly large amount of randomness- reminds a bit of cosmic encounter which tom loves and I hate, but that's me. What made me angry was mostly the mess that were the rules and some cards effects, the multiple corner cases we had no answer for, and the fact that I heard Tom trash multiple games during his reviews for the same exact same things.

We didn't really have fun, and spending the game with the rulebook under my elbow to address the numerous questions we had (spoiler alert: no answer in the rulebook, a few in the FAQ) was probably not helping.

I will keep listening to the podcasts and loving their videos, but I will not assume again that a great podcast makes automatically a great design.

I don't need to own this game, but I don't mind playing someone else's copy.  This game is totally full of "take that" with a fair measure of negotiation and extortion as well.  There is some fun to be had, but only if you don't mind that control is fleeting and generally only a concept and not usually easy to realize in this game.

A mafia themed game where you run a crime family.  You are trying to get your "family" members to gain positions higher in the crime organization.  It has area majority in that you put influence tokens on members to gain money and points.  

There is quite a bit of card play that allows you to gain this influence.  

I find the game fun, but it can be very mean.  Also, there is a strong possibility that the game could end with king-making.  It seems that this could have been eliminated if there was not a track that showed who was ahead.  If points had been hidden, this game is a 10.

Nothing Personal is a gangster-themed rip-off of Kremlin, keeping the tree structure and position powers, removing nearly everything else that is good about the game (the aging, stress, secret influence, etc) and replacing those with worse mechanics making it a complete random king making fest. I do enjoy the gangster theme and the top notch Game Salute production, however the Courtier card-based influence placing and ease to whack gangsters make for a much worse game than the original. It is also way too long for what it is making it a rather painful gaming experience.

Got to play a full game of this tonight with 4 players.  Decided to make agreements binding and felt that it was a pretty solid game that way.

Really enjoyed the unique feel of the game play.  Constant changes in the cards and control of the gangsters, coupled with the influence cards really screwing with you makes for a fun game.  Strategy is hard to really focus on as it constantly keeps changing.

A must try!

Received 8/10/2013, played 2 5 player games.  So far so good, not ready to expand.  Played 3 4 player games also.  It has some interesting stuff going on - like area control that moves and goes away (gangsters).  I like that, haven't seen it before in any games.

Great game! and the theme fits into the game-play incredibly. Both after the first and the second time playing it, almost every player was trying to convince me to set another game session soon for playing it again. Very tense, very fun, very interactive. just remember it is NOT for any group. If you have someone in the group who can be offended if someone, (or everyone!) back-stabs him in a game, avoid this game.

It's a well-produced and balanced game. The theme is well done, instructions seem good, and play is fun. 

However, it can bog down in negotiations. Even though it's called "Nothing Personal" it can easily turn that way and suffer from Kingmaking. It also feels like a thousand jabs to get what you want. 

Fun though with fun players, or probably good with all serious players, but I would not suggest you mix fun players and cut-throat players together. 

Of course if you took the negotiation part out of it, it might just flatten out to a math exercise, though for my own personality  would probably prefer that. 

I think for serious players who like negotiation (and could keep it quick), this would be a 9. For me it's a 7.

My group really enjoyed this game. However, I would say that I have never in my life felt as though the end score was as much of a "player grade" as it did in this game. Experienced players scores were in a certain tier, less experienced players are in another tier, and non-experienced players are always in the third tier. Every time. Without even setting the game up yet, my group could tell you the order that players will finish based on their skill level.

Nothing Personal definitely feels like a labor of love. At its heart, this is an area control game with some negotiation going on. There are some really neat ideas with the influencing of different gangsters, and how people are shuffled around to fill the roles. I also really like how smoothly gangsters are given both character-based powers and role-based powers. That all being said, I think the game is fairly underdeveloped.

For one thing, it's entirely too long for what it is. There is no real sense of progression from the beginning to the end, other than seeing new characters show up and rise through the ranks. It seems like a better option would have been to either shorten the game down by a couple of rounds, or make it so you automatically win after reaching a certain point threshold. Along with that, the game feels really hokey with its presentation. Using real-life board game designers and reviewers breaks the theme for me, and the cardboard bills are really bulky for what they are. I would almost rather use paper money.

I could go on further, but Tom Vasel has said himself that he would like to streamline this design, and I think that would result in a much better game. The amount of fiddliness with no arc that develops over the course of the game really starts to wear on me after awhile. This is one of the few games I started off enjoying it as I played, but it quickly became apparent that this game is too long and drawn-out for what should be a 45-minute game.

Tom Vasel's reimagining of Kremlin production values live up to the high standard he praises in other games. Given the games he likes, Nothing Personal fits that mold: Chaotic and punchy.

Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of area control, especially where one's control is so exceptionally brief. Also, NP runs long and can suffer from kingmaking if someone wants to tank the game.

Glad to have tried it. Plus, it was amusing to see some of the Dice Tower guys on the cards.

Few games in my collection require an exact player profile, but caveat emptor: If your friends don't like direct aggression mixed with their Euro design, you're in for a long game.  Also, it's a Game Salute game, if that matters.

But if your friends don't mind, Nothing Personal is a brass-knuckled no-fuck-YOU-fest that delivers on its initial premise perfectly.  You just need to want that kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is way overproduced. Having the thickest cardboard and coins doesn't improve the fun, it just increases the price. Nobody does that for a reason.

It's certainly an improvement about Kremlin. It solves its biggest issue: the players don't spend 2/3 of the gameplay doing nothing but waiting for their chance anymore. 

It doesn't solve the bureocracy [minor] issue and its excessive lenght.

It's all about randomness and negotiation, just too much of them for my taste. I enjoy very much the first rounds, but it becomes quite tiresome after the second hour.

RATING: 7
It's only a 6 for the gameplay but it gets an extra rating point for how nicely the game invokes the theme, being a "do whatever it takes to get your guys to the top" kind of game. If you break it down, it's an area majority game (getting most influence on each mobster) with the ability to kill off areas or move the areas up the board so that they're worth more points. There's a sense of Kremlin/Message To The Czar re the movement, but there are no secret objectives here - it's all out in the open. Which means there's a ton of perceived leader bashing, and if played well the game should end up with everyone bunched on the score track. Which of course makes it a bit of a lottery, boosted perhaps by your last-round target deflection skills. A brilliant name, "hey, it's nothing personal", takes the edge off shenanigans and makes it more palatable to euro sandbox sensitivities. But steer clear if you're really not into take-that area majority games.

I have a lot of fun with this game!  The components are amazing, and the gameplay is top-notch.  I really have fun trying to take over the capo, and seeing that ring change hands almost every turn... sometimes multiple times in a turn.

Even though I'm not generally a negotiation-style-game fan, I really like this one a lot, because it's sort of minimized.

The art, and the fact that the people are representatives of people and game designers, I feel a connection to many of the personalities that show up, even if it's only just barely.

I freely admit that I was mostly interested in it simply because it was a game designed by Tom Vasel.  I did get a chance to see it played, and a friend had the first edition and brought it over for an fairly in-depth, yet brief, overview.  Just finally got it and cannot wait to get it to the table.  Probably not this weekend, as we already have a few heavies scheduled that we want to try to fit in, but maybe next...or as soon thereafter as we have enough people at the house to try it.

I do not understand why the game is rated so low. It plays beautifully, and feels different every time based of players' play-styles and what gangsters come out. However, several people should invest lower down on the pyramid. If only one person does, then will own the game board for a round or two later on, which can take away some of the fun. Still, an amazing game with amazing components.

El juego me ha gustado bastante por la interacción que tiene, si el grupo de juego se presta a ello te puedes echar unas risas sumergiéndote en el tema, verte como un mafioso negociando, haciendo promesas y amenazando al resto de jugadores.

Por otro lado, lo hemos jugado a 3 jugadores y a pesar de que se puede jugar, la experiencia de juego también depende del grupo. En esta primera partida, uno de los jugadores, que estaba muy descolgado se alió con el que iba en primer lugar y desde el tercer turno y hasta el final, entre los dos machacaron al tercer jugador de tal forma que este perdió claramente las oportunidades de ganar y los dos últimos turnos paso a ser un juego entre dos perdiendo toda su gracia, dejo de haber negociación.

Aun así creo que el juego es bueno y que jugado a 4 o 5 se evitara este problema (por lo menos en mi grupo), al igual que en el Shogun y el Tikal.

Otro punto a mencionar es la duración, que si bien no se me hizo excesivamente largo si me pareció un poco repetitivo al final, pero supongo que si la tensión se hubiera mantenido hasta el final, este sensación se hubiera diluido, en todo caso como he mencionado antes me parece un juego totalmente recomendable.

Jugado a 4  jugadores la cosa ha mejorado bastante, la posibilidad de bloquear o machacar a un jugador es bastante menos clara ya que las negociaciones entre 4 dan lugar a mas cambios de alianzas, y la nivelacion de puntos de respeto en esta partida fue mas justa, de hecho acabamos todos en un margen de 10 puntos de respeto (victoria)y se dieron muchas mas negociaciones que en la primera partida, asi que nos duro la partida unas 4 horas....

Very Impressive components quality.  After one play, the rulebook showed its inadequacy and was lacking as there were too many grey areas.

Not as impressed as I thought I would be.

[UPDATE, August 2017: The Godfather: Corleone's Empire does most of what this game does and probably improves slightly on it, simply by adding a bit more 'proper game' rather than 'party game', and a bit less 'crazy catch-up mechanism' and 'mathy cascading pyramid of influence' etc. Nothing Personal has more personality and better pieces, though.]

This is an astonishingly thematic game that is fantastically 'knockabout', with some added depth. It is excellent if you want to spend a couple of hours blackmailing your friends! 

However it has very similar problems to the game Cosmic Encounter, which is the favourite game of Nothing Personal's co-creator Tom Vasel. In particular, the first two-thirds of the game are almost entirely irrelevant because anyone who creeps ahead will simply get zapped by the huge catch-up mechanisms inherent in the game.When the game ends, it can feel like only the final round mattered ... and maybe the round before, where it was set up.

Compared to Cosmic Encounter, this has more fun theme and slightly more tactical depth but also more bookwork.

The Euro-ish element within the game doesn't quite work. Placing the 'influence tokens' is quite tricky/thinky and time-consuming, but can be totally unravelled by the excess of revenge, chaos and kingmaking that happens next.

Its components are gorgeous and chunky. Check the online errata, though, as there are important errors in the first edition - including two big ones on the actual board!

The seemingly endless variety of gangsters (many being charicatures of game designers etc) is impressive - especially with expansions. They all have different abiltiies. However they broadly work the same.

This game is a rollercoaster ride of interactive hassling, so play it with the right people. I have seen it reduce a young player to tears because they felt victimised (well, mainly because they didn't understand that falling behind in this game means little). The gangster theme itself is probably fine for young people because all the murder ('whacking') is relatively comical (albeit still terminal!) and there's no drugs in it etc.

Overall, this is a unique game so it might have a permanent place in my collection - even if I very rarely play it. I think I'd get rid of Cosmic Encounter ahead of this.

Very fun game - it's essentially an area majority game, which I always like, with an interesting mechanic where you can try to push out people that are higher on the gangster family tree, both increasing the value of the person you control and making the player who controlled the other person skip their turn.  Looking forward to buying this when it gets published.

RATING: 4
I was looking forward to trying this game but was just left feeling frustrated. I didn't feel there was a lot of room for interesting negotiating, I felt the board state changed too rapidly and constantly, I felt players had too many options from their cards in a game where your options are hard to assess. Often negotiating just came down to "whoever bribes me the most can have the bottom half of this card/win this tie", that's not negotiating, that's bidding.

The production was also frustrating, you're putting stacks of US nickle sized chits on playing cards, that gets crowded and makes the board hard to read as often these chits blocked card information. Cubes would have been much easier to view at a glance.

The card that allows you to fill an empty spot is WAY too good, the Colby card has a totally stupid effect on the game and should not be played with. It reeks of not having been tested.

++POSITIVES++
+Ante mechanism for card play is very interesting
+Clever seeming area control game, if less chaotic/wild/lucky could be great
+Gorgeous design on the board/chits/card backs

--NEGATIVES--
-Too feral and unpredictable of a game
-Board is cluttered and hard to read at a glance
-Negotiating feels uninteresting because the wildness
-Too much downtime 
-Lasted much longer than it should have
-Some cards are too good/bad/untested

There is a lot of player interaction in this game and so that by definition lends itself to the group playing defining the playing experience as much as the game itself.

Seems I need more plays ...

I really enjoy Nothing Personal.  Great mix of deal making, card play, and strategy.  All the options and negotiating can lead to analysis paralysis, though, lengthening the game.

I INSTANTLY fell in love with this game, and that's even after getting destroyed in my first play of it.

The game is a battle for influence in a mob by gaining influence over key members and using the powers on influence cards, the gangster cards, and the gangster positions as well as negotiating with other players to further improve your position.

The reason I'm so enthralled with this game is that first of all the variety is great.  There are a ton of influence and gangster cards and they all provide different unique abilities and stats.  Each game will feel very different.

The reason I don't think I'll lose any of this enthusiasm is that the options are varied, deep, and many so even if the amount of content starts to become familiar each game can still be played differently, the more players the better in my opinion as you're vying and negotiating with more people.

This is all in addition to some of the best quality components and some of the prettiest and most fun art I've ever seen in a game.

Home run for me on all accounts.

I greatly enjoy Kremlin as an experience that I am hesitant to call a "game", but in recent years we have seen two attempts at updating it. Chicken Caesar tried, with some success, to turn it into a low-luck modern eurogame; Nothing Personal attempts the same for the ameritrash school.

As such, it's a great success: play is much more dynamic (characters move much more often than Kremlin's party members and are far, far easier to eliminate) and engaging (it is much easier to exert influence and gain control), it does a better job of encouraging negotiation, and there is no chance of being screwed because you lucked out when selecting influence.

That all said, part of Kremlin's charm is in its uniqueness; Nothing Personal's efforts at gamification unsurprisingly result in a product far more "gamey". It doesn't quite capture the theme in the same way, implementing instead -- in typical ameritrash style -- a lot of random card draws, "take that" card play and direct attacks. Bringing these game elements to the fore invites other criticisms, like the wild variability in usefulness of the cards and late-game opportunities for kingmaking. It is far too long for a game with such short-term focus.

I like Kremlin specifically because I don't know what to do to win but because long-term planning can pay off in spades; Nothing Personal, by contrast, is a relatively straightforward tactical points-grab. For fans of that sort of thing it's a real winner. It is not for me.

RATING: 4
One of the worst negotiation games I've played.  Open money and open points means the negotiations are problematic at best.  You can tell exactly where people are at and what they need, so you have way more leverage than you should.  Going into the final round, negotiations should break down in a really chaotic, potentially unfun manner depending on your group and whether they play to win, play for place, or play to pick on the leader.  In better negotiation games, points, money, or both are obfuscated better so that negotiations can still work, or they are shorter so that it isn't as big of a deal.  This game is 2-3 hours long, and the design can't hold for that long.

The art is passable, but the overall cartoony style isn't really my thing when it comes to the crime theme.  "Sleepin wif da fishes" made me want someone to be whacked in real life.  Also, the text on the cards is difficult to read from any distance.

Speaking of cards, the balance on the cards played from hand is pretty horrifying.  Most of the cards are pretty similar, but there are a few with ridiculously powerful effects that can swing a lot of what happens in the game.  Some playtesting with half-way decent gamers could have discovered some cards that do not make sense.  There are far too many questions about how cards work than there should be.  I'm also not sure how I feel about the Capo having as much power as he has.  He basically has all the negotiations power while also gaining the most points, and the game really punishes going for a regime change.  He even gets to go first in every round, which is fantastically powerful.  It actually worked decently in our game, but it's something that didn't feel quite right, and I'd want to keep an eye on it if I ever played the game again.

The mechanic that sends gangsters to jail when too much influence is piled on them is a really good one.  Moving through the gangsters to gain points/money and then back through them again to do their actions in an interesting idea as well.  It felt like I was playing a prototype with those interesting ideas that needed a lot more playtesting before it came out.

File this under: another half-baked Kickstarter game. Too many cards where you can't do anything interesting or useful, too many times where you can only play tactically as you just don't draw enough cards to plan ahead. Some cards are frankly just better than others and there are some wild swings of luck.

In our play, no-one was deeply impressed and then, at the end, one player drew 2 cards which allowed him to fill vacant spots, promote everyone he wanted, and scored him 30 points - in a game where the winning score was in the mid-60s. Random much?

The good: The ante system is nice. The artwork is okay, if very 'Kickstartery', the arrows and names of who fills the vacancies are well done.

The bad: Everything else.

Interesting game.  I think I like it, it may be a tad too long though.  I think I'll try to play only 4 years next time and see if things work as well or not.  It was quite fun, and there is a lot of interaction.  But really it might be about managing to dig and find the good cards and waiting for the perfect time to play them, coupled with some unrestrained negotiation. Components are great quality though.

This is one of those great games that I don't get to play often.  It's just a bit long to explain and longer to play.  I think it actually plays best with 3, I've only played with 3 and 5.  I really do like it and is a very balanced game, just wish it went a bit faster.  Also VERY AP prone.

Only got one play, but feels overdesigned. Even the BGG 1.2 rules gave me a headache. The resultant AP and the constantly encouraged bribing and dealing drags what would be a great 1 hour or so game to 3+. Not recommended for players that analyse every possibility before acting.

The best game with player interaction. The theme plays a huge role for this game to get a "10" as score. The rules are not well written and they have gaps and omissions. Just track the FAQ at BGG. This is a relatively simple games that result in amazing game play, it has luck but not to much, it has excellent player interaction (and substandard rule book). Production quality is of the highest standard. Get your copy today!

Kind of feels like Cosmic Encounters with an area control game in the middle.  There are a lot of tactical decisions and weighing options, but you also definitely need to talk some politics, try to get people on your side, and team up on others if you want to win.

My favorite theme, and a top notch production. Love it!

The reason why it's not hitting a perfect 10 is because it can feel like it's dragging sometimes.  It's a fairly long game, and if you have a bunch of passive players, it can really suck a lot of the potential enjoyment out.  The sheer length alone keeps it from hitting the table anywhere near as much as I'd like.

Also, since there are so many more decisions in this game than Cosmic Encounter, it can lead to Analysis Paralysis and lots of repeated rule explanations and clarifications.  Making a move and assassinating a gangster seems to lead to a lot of confusion.

A great social game, which encourages almost-constant screwage, deal-making, back-stabbing, kingmaking and general skulduggery. Great fun with the right crowd, i.e. People who find screwing each other over hilariously funny and don't table flip. You know if your gaming group is the right crowd for this game. Clue: do they like Diplomacy, Cosmic Encounter, Kremlin, etc. If you like resource optimising in silence, without looking up from your player board, you're probably not the right group. Also don't play this game if you don't like your opponents messing with your plans... The whole game is your opponents messing with your plans. 

Love the cartoon art style. The components are massively over-produced. My copy has cardboard tokens almost a centimetre thick, a gold metal capo ring, deeply embossed dice, and separate card boxes for players' influence tokens. Despite this, the victory point track is slightly too small for the top-hatted gangster meeples, the huge player boards serve no purpose apart from 'whacking' your opponents (they double as a weapon), and the box is hard to close once you've punched everything out.

Not very impressed by this one. It isn't terrible but I feel the best elements of it have already been captured in much simpler and shorter games such as Bohnanza. I feel a highly social and interactive game like this benefits greatly from less complexity. This feels like a more flabby, inelegant retread of that ground. Very nice, high quality components.

RATING: 7
After going through the rulebook and then playing a game, I can see where so many people are having a rough time with this one. It looks like Vasel and Avery wrote up the rules for this game in full early on in their play-testing and then line item edited things that changed as they came up. As a result, there seems to be a few spots that refer to things that aren't in the game anymore or that have significantly changed. It's not crippling (and I think more is being made of it than is strictly necessary, because of Tom's background as a game reviewer) but it can throw you for a loop when specific oddball situations pop up. It reminds me a little of Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island's rule issues, where all the information is in place, but sometimes seems to contradict itself due to poor wording or bad organization.

That all aside, the game is pretty solid. I think it takes a game or two before it really comes together. It requires a hefty dose of player negotiation to be interesting, which is tough if players do not know how to value their actions. Honestly, that's the only learning curve there is. Once at least one person at the table has worked through those few rules ambiguities, the game plays very smoothly.

One other thing...these components are ridiculous. I wish all of my games were put together with this much love. I'm not even talking about the super heavy duty cardboard money and tokens or the cool tuck boxes. To me the most amazing things are the cards. There are just a ton of them and each and every one has unique art (the gangsters) or flavor text (influence). They clearly spent a lot of time and money on this aspect of the game and it really helps to keep players engaged in the theme.

Well done, Dice Tower!

RATING: 6
A game that doesn't really know what it wants to be.

It is neither a light, crazy game about negotiating influence nor a serious game where you have control over your board position.

Instead, while there appears to be a really fun basis for a game there someplace, Nothing Personal devolves into a slew of small, very constrained decisions that result tedious game play that overstays its welcome.

In my personal opinion, the game should have been stripped down and more "wild and craziness" added or stepped up and some of the chaos removed.  (I would have preferred the former).  Also, there are a bunch of design choices that add time but not gameplay.

Dare I say it . . . standard Kickstarter fare . . . 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My initial impressions after the first few plays are increasingly positive. While new players do have a large number of moving parts to understand at first, the game's design and flow of play are intuitive enough that the actual "learning curve" is very easy to overcome. Players will have a good sense of what they're doing after the first round or two of play. I love that the game manages to have such breadth of options without getting bogged down in complexity.

There can seem to be a great deal of back-and-forth jockeying throughout the the game due to the area-control element combined with the card-play. However, I've found that as the players learn the game, their choices and the various mechanics will tend to keep the competition tight. This will tend to keep all players in the game to the last round with a shot to win, if they can make the right choices.

The game doesn't feel it's length at all, due to players being constantly involved and having plenty of options every turn. It plays equally well with 3 or 4 players (have yet to play it with 5), in fact, the 3 player game really surprised me in how tight and consistently engaging it was (most games I've played tend to play best at the upper end of their player counts).

Nothing Personal has come under a lot of criticism for its editing problems and some have tended to dismiss it as a random mess of "king-maker" or "bash-the-leader" but the underlying game is proving to be so much more than that. It is a very engaging area-control game with elements of card-play and trading/negotiation with some very clever mechanics that keep the players on relatively even footing if they make smart decisions.

It feels like something of a cross between Lords of Vegas, Tammany Hall, El Grande and Cosmic Encounter and I mean that in the very best way possible.

I suspect this will end up on my short list of "all-time favorite games".

Having now played it with all player counts, I will say that I think it plays better with 3 or 4 players than with 5. At 5 players, it's just a little bit too long. Still, it's a fantastic game.

Mafia negotiation. Pyramid of Special Gangster characters to influence. Make your reputation the most solid through card play to build influence on the gangsters or for special effects. Negotiate to be or not be the target of player choices. Bribery. Make a move using the special die on the pyramid. Whack a guy dice. Use your fence to buy cards. Get more family members to fill openings from being whacked or taken by the Feds. Adding a poker-like ante with raises on card play is great! Clever interaction. Deep theme. Super components like the ring for the caporegime. 38 Specials and shivs not included.

This game's great fun so long as the players don't over-think everything. I had a game run in excess of three hours and that was just four rounds out of the five you're supposed to play. This was mainly due to AP players calculating the infinitesimal ramifications of chucking influence tokens at gangsters. I've also had a game where we just got on with it and finished in an hour and a half - this was vastly preferable. I think 4 rounds rather than 5 is the sweet spot for this game.

There's something inelegant about the presentation of information on the board - it is hard to see what's happening unless you are the one sat so that things are legible. I've had a few pretty so-so plays of this now and I feel like I've had enough of negotiation style games.

RATING: 9
This game is a riot to play. Even with negotiations it's not too slow, and it's very funny, with so much backstabbing that it's hard to stay mad at anyone. You will, without a doubt, end up backstabbing or screwing over every other player in the game.

If you enjoy chaotic games full of wheeling and dealing, lying, backstabbing and a huge heaping of "screw you", then this is for you!

However, the production values confuse me. Some things are just great, good card artwork, coins to die for, the ring is great, and the tuck boxes for each player are pretty cool, but then there's a lot of bad.

The game has a horrible insert, and there's really no good way of storing the game's component's in the box as is.

The cards are ultra-thin and with a solid core which ensures that they fold and crease rather than bend, and then flex back. Even in thin sleeves they feel too thin, and may require premium sleeves to feel like regular game cards and not get bent in play.

There are two misprints on the board itself, and not small ones either. I cannot understand how they didn't catch this in quality assurance. The game's tokens are very thick, but flaking right out of the box, they  look like they will peel apart after a few plays.

If you get outbid on your guy, there's basically a "Lose a turn" mechanic in the sense that you sit by yourself doing nothing for 15 minutes while everyone gets paid and does their actions. Very poor mechanic. Pretty okay game otherwise, but that ruined it for me.

There's a reason that other games with similar mechanics to this (Twilight Struggle, 1960) are only two-players.

I will edit this as I get more gameplays in, but all of the mechanics and negotiation are just really well done. Well done, Tom and Steve.

Edit - I have now played twice more. This is still a really fun game, and I am always down to play. I am definitely seeing that there is a huge catch up mechanic, and never count out someone who falls behind early. Often times the winner seems to be the person who stocks up on influence cards towards the end.

Great bits, and seemed like an interesting concept. However, as a game it just falls flat. At its core there's a clever area control mechanic, but the heavy negotiation and "take that" mechanic makes it completely arbitrary. The winner is just the player that plays the meta game the best. Which can be fine on it's own, but ruins a game like this.

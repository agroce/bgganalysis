RATING: 6
Mechanically simpler than any of Splotter's other big games' but the learning curve is still quite steep.The planning aspects make this a game that can be very very prone to analysis paralysis and for the other players to sit there while you carefully work out your move only to find 80% of the way through it that you did it wrong and want to go back to the start can be a big downer. Maybe we should invoke a ‘once you’ve started you can’t go back’ rule but this is against my usual protocols and actually, as a ‘thinking’ game, Duck Dealer deserves better than that. Nevertheless, it is this ‘downtime’ factor that initially stops me marking it higher

There is a game here, but it lasts for about 15 minutes while you figure out which is the most efficient loop. Then just load up and execute. Boring.

RATING: 5.8
Very glad I got to play it (Cheers Paul!). The complexities and logistics are familiar to Roads and Boats fans, but the mechanism of saving up energy to spend doing a lot of actions at once is a new one, making it much more of a brain burner. The last few turns are pretty tense and frequently other players will jump in on opportunities that you were saving up for.

Our game took 2.5 hours for 4 new players (+ 1 hour rules) so don't worry too much about length.

It is definitely one of those games where you should only have loose plans - I'd probably not recommend thinking too much about your plan until you have a good handful of chips to spend - the board changes too much for longer term ideas.

RATING: 5
Great little game, very overpriced though.

Doesn't work 2 player. May not work multiplayer once people have some experience at it.

Seems unbalanced in favour of setting yourself up a circular production cycle and once you start it there is no stopping you. The whole exploring aspect is dwarfed by a player who can quickly get a profitable route up and running, just blindly focusing on a small chain of events.

This has one of the silliest themes I've come across, but nevertheless it is quite a brainburner. You are in charge of a spaceship flying across the galaxy, exploring planets and discovering their resources, establishing factories (such as rubber ducks) and then delivering goods (such as religion) to others. The main mechanism is pick-up and delivery. On you're turn you either pick energy tokens (movement, construction and trade) or you take an action which is a long one, since you are allowed to do as much as your tokens allow. The catch is that there are only 24 actions overall, for all players, so taking the action in the right moment may be the key to victory.

RATING: 5.5
Optimizing game that is controlled by the number of turns in the game. A winning strategy is to get ahead in score than keep wasting turns with what ever small amount of resources you have to end the game.

Overall, a good strategy that needs some play by every gamer so that such above strategy is kept to a final race and not by a single run away leader.

It's unfortunate that evn with with head to head race, we can count who wins by the last 3 turns or so, as all resources are public knowledge.

Good start to a weak finishing.

My issue is not with the game but with the publisher's policy. I do not like the destination that the policy leads to. It leads to a flooding of bad games and good games with substandard production reaching higher prices. As a consumer i object to that scenario hence the rating.

This game is not for everyone.  If the idea of trading initiative for efficiency with a tremendous amount of forward planning does not sound fun, then this is not a game for you.  Suffers from the problem that your complicated plan can be disrupted right before your turn, which forces you to spend a few minutes evaluating alternative plans.

RATING: 4
A unique gaming experience.  Glad I've tried it, but not desperate to play again.  The one player (of 5) who's played before stored up around 80 movement disks before setting out on, what can only be described as a journey (and time for a coffee break for everyone else.  The game turns are very uneven.  The mechanics fairly dry and as everyone is planning to do much the same, it is frequently the case that your goal has to be recalibrated at the beginning of your turn, leading to more down time and AP.  A clever game, but not much fun.

This is a very engrossing game. I am convinced that the efficiency of my actions was only limited by my ability to organize my thoughts in my head. At some point, I would have so many actions saved up that I would just take my actions before I forget what it was that I was trying to do. I have never played a game quite like this. The downside of this game is that everyone takes several short turns that are occasionally interupted by another player's mamoth turn...which leaves all of the other players sitting around a bit.

Complex planning game. The cheap, clipart pasted on theme really detracts from this game. A bad attempt to make it more appealing. The mechanics are pretty good, but it outstayed it's welcome and feels about 30 minutes too long. Plus, the player mats are paper instead of cardboard and the chits are also not of high quality. A disappointment.

Initial impressions:

Interesting game - a lot to keep track of, particularly upon first play.  Other players making stupid moves can reflect harshly upon you (but winds up worse for them).

Would like to play it again - preliminary score of 8.

9-3-09:

3-player.  I liked the better development, having more time to get your ship up to snuff, etc.  I don't feel that a 2-movement ship is worth it.  The system overly penalizes you for grabbing ship components when they're not worthwhile.  There is, simply, very little reason to bother with the 2-level.  Just replace if you need something that badly.  Better yet, plan ahead.  With 3-players, it seems things could get rather static; one player maybe jumping out into the world to get as many 10's and 25's as s/he can, the others aiming for a longer game.  Or perhaps all players aiming for the longer-game.

I'm still not 100% sure what I think, overall - there are some neat mechanics in play, but ultimately there might be other games I prefer for a similar brain-burning experience (like Roads and Boats).

Pick-up-and-deliver.  180 min.  Others say:  Cross between Merchant of Venus and a technology/development tree such as Neuland or Roads & Boats.  Too much calculating and planning ahead.  Energy can be spent to buy extra actions (extending your turn).  A viable strategy to win is that players can stall ("turtle") and save energy turn after turn and then have a super long turn.  Yuck.

I'm unsure how to rate this - I'm unsure if I like it!

There's stuff I definitely don't like:

Stupid ships which don't fit on the board properly (disks would have been so much better)

Stupid theme - either do a humourous theme or a sci-fi theme, but not a hybrid where some is wacky and some bits attempt to be serious. It felt like it was a case of "opps we don't have an artist handy, I know lets throw together a bunch of free clip art, that'll do"

Over large playmat and energy disks - means the whole game takes up much more space than it would need to

AP hell - don't play this with a group who suffer from AP you'll never finish it ... downtime is horrible

Saying that, in other ways I quite like it - game play is very different from other games and with the right players (who aren't so worried about optimising every turn) it rolls along.

I suspect the best option is to just keep taking disks and have a mega turn ... rather than have a plan and take enough disks just to do it, but I need to play it more to see if that's true.

Not entirely sure what I think yet, but I'm still thinking about the game and trying to figure out what I can do differently next time (i.e. to avoid finishing last by a mile).

Definitely need to play it again soon before I forget everything I learned!

Interesting idea for a space trading game which suffers from horrible downtime issues endemic to the game system. The progression of products tries a little too hard to be funny at the cost of reducing how intuitive the production graph is. Looks like it was put together from clip art. I'd rather remove my own nipples with an industrial sander than play again.

RATING: 9
I don't feel like I've played Duck Dealer enough to comment much, but it is a great game - as many have noted, similar to MoV, but without the roll-and-move repetitiveness of that game.  This is basically a pick-up-and-deliver logistics economization game; what sets it apart is the inventive turn system it uses.  Basically, every turn you either take some tokens that provide one of three types of action and horde them up, or you start spending your horde of tokens and take many actions, one after another.  This means your turns will either last around 5 seconds or 5 minutes - so if you're allergic to downtime, this is not the game for you.  What the system adds, though, is a push-your-luck element rarely found in games of this type.  The random distribution of nearly all game elements assures the mechanics stay fresh.  The design is very Splotter typical, with a few innovations and a lot of grinding and careful planning.  If you tend to like Splotter's games, you'll probably like it; I really don't understand the negative perceptions shrouding this one.

My god, what an awful game. We gave up after about 45 minutes after coming to the conclusion that this game was completely, utterly insane. There is a niche for this kind of brutal, calculational, do-one-thing-wrong-and-you're-totally-screwed, sit-around-and-wait-for-half-an-hour type game, but I am certainly not in it. This game does so many things wrong on so many levels it's almost easier to believe it was some sort of a bad joke. Awful.

Very positive first impression.  This game has the elements of Roads and Boats I liked combined with the elements of Merchant of Venus I enjoyed with all of the less interesting elements stripped away.  It will take me several more plays before I have any sense of how "good" the game is, but it seems completely underrated.

Duck Dealer is a hardcore logistics game that will appeal to those who like Neuland and perhaps Roads & Boats, though the fiddle factor is much lower than the latter.

DD, for a Splotter game, is deceptively simple in terms of rules density: players have ships, the ships have spots on them where crew and cargo space can go. On their turn there are two basic things they can do: 1) collect energy (majority of turns) 2) Take an action turn. 

Energy collecting is just what it sounds like, players collect 1 of the 3 different types of energy discs (Trade, Move, Build) from the supply, and then additional ones based on their crew. 

The action turn is where the heart of the game is though. On there, players use up all of the discs they've been collecting to move around the galaxy. Out in space they can:

1) Visit and use mines, which produce basic goods.
2) Build and use factories, which refine multiple basic goods into intermediate or advanced goods.
3) Sell finished intermediate and advanced goods to consumers for victory points.

There are a lot of other nuances to the game, but that's the basic premise. The game is extremely heavy on the logistics and individual player turns can take a while, particularly late in the game when the infrastructure is built up.

There seem to be a number of ways to approach the game. Ships, for instance, and extremely modifiable: it is possible to have a ship that is quick with hardly any crew, or one which is a loaded-down freighter that needs to place a lot of intergalactic highway cubes and to use player-created wormholes to get where it's going.

There is a lot of tactical play in this, but there is also room for strategy. In terms of tactics: being the person who builds a higher level factory, or being the first one to fill a consumer demand gets a very nice bonus. In terms of strategy, it is possible to set up very efficient VP creating engines with careful use of privilege cubes, which allow players to have unlimited use of a given tile for only one energy marker instead of having to pay a marker for each individual use.

I like the logistical nature of this game a lot and the learning curve seems steep, which makes it interesting to me. The lack of random elements in the game and the curve mean this will be a tough game to play in mixed-experience groups. Lapping people is definitely a possibility. Solid though, definitely like it, definitely interesting. I don't think it has the magical hook that Indonesia's merger mechanic represented, but it still brings some interesting decision space to the table, and should clock in at a smooth 2 hours with experienced players, which is pretty fast for what this game has to offer. 

Like many games of this type, the biggest niggle is the start-stop nature of play where players save up energy continuously and then take 5-10 minute turns with it while everyone else waits. There are definitely strategic elements to play, but it's difficult to make real hardcore plans while it's not your turn (at least if other players are taking an action turn before you) because the board state can change a lot with a single monster turn. This isn't a killer for me, but if this sort of thing bothers you in games like Java or Neuland, then it will probably annoy you even more in Duck Dealer. For my money, Neuland does this type of game in a slightly more satisfying manner because its action point system keeps turns from getting completely out of hand like they can in DD.

On an aside: this was clearly rushed out the door. The player aids have a misprint on the VP payout and the free cargo hold is confusingly coloured like it can hold a crew member. Beyond this, the choice of using the same cubes for the highways and privileges when they need to be separated is questionable and I have to assume was made so the game could be ready in time for Spiel. I imagine these will be corrected in subsequent printings, but they are still niggly annoyances and probably shouldn't be accepted from a game with this price point. I also wouldn't want to play this with 5 just because of the dodgy colour choices: orange and natural wood are fairly close to each other in the wrong light. Someone needs to take a page from Liberte's book and bring back the distinctive hot pink as a non-primary stand-out colour!

On a final aside: break out the Plano box OCD for this one...17 chit types and a small number of each one. Sorting these out before each game? Madness.

This game does not have end game issues. As you would expect from a perfect information delivery game it is hard/impossible to catch up to an early leader. This game probably needs to be played by spreadsheet to reduce the ridiculous amount of fiddliness involved in both goods conversion/purchasing and in energy storage/expeding.

Despite these issues, this is a fine game from Splotter. Clearly [-]modeled on[/-] [-]ripping off[/-] [-]fixing up[/-] [i]based on[/i] the classic game Merchant of Venus, but modified to remove the roll and move mechanic as well as the other midgame randomness.

This wasn't a bad game.  But the game seems to reward sitting around and planning... no make that a game of chicken.  You sit and scheme until you have to go as fast as you can to make sure other people don't reap the reward.

That being said, it is still a pretty good game.  The only reason I rank it down is that it gets directly compared to Antiquity, Indonesia and Die Macher (other games of the same length) and in my book it is found wanting.

I'm a big fan of logistics games (a.k.a. pick-up-and-deliver).  This adds a planning layer, forcing you to consider all you want to do and to collect the action points necessary before you can actually do anything.  This results in constant calculating and recalculating to figure out if this is really what you want, and if you have enough, and whoops, Bob did that, so I need a new plan, so more calculating and recalculating, and remembering (or yet more recalculating), and, well, oof.

Once you get past the weird trading goods, you'll discover some smart interlocking mechanics. I especially liked the way playerturns are handled: prepare, prepare, prepare and go!

After 1 game. Too much planning which with the longer moves would evidently expand the time horribly. I prefer games where you plan your strategy in the beginning eventually adjusting it a bit if there is a need for it. In Duck Dealer it seems like each move takes a thorough planning because if you fall back before the end of the game and someone goes ahead of you bringing the same plan into action  you are probably screwed.
Additionally -1 rating for the fact that it's quite difficult to scan the moves of your opponents and the game is prone to cheating (I hate it even while playing with trusted players).

Not like Merchant of Venus in the way it plays but it does feel like its spiritual successor in terms of flying around space in the most efficient way in order to convert goods to points. Here, the dice-based movement system has been replaced with an action point system in the form of action discs. You spend your turns either taking action discs (3-5 usually) or spending them. It's not unusual to accumulate 20-30+ discs before actually taking a turn. There are three types of action discs (build, move,  trade) so you need to plan out -- either on paper or by placing in front of you -- your 20-30 actions and make sure you have what you need before pulling the trigger. 

All that action management is for the purposes of getting goods A+B to convert to C, and then getting goods D+E to convert to F, then take C+F and convert to G for mega points. It doesn't sound all that exciting on paper, but the fun is trying to be the most efficient in the game, and I like the addition of "wormholes" that allow you a once-per-game placement of a shortcut across the board. My concern is that once someone gets a lead I don’t see how you possibly catch them as the timer mechanism in the game is player controlled. You get a lead, you start draining the time. We called the game before it was over due to an uncatchable leader, but perhaps with equal players it's a tense finish(?).

To be honest I can not actually judge this game, as I was lost in confusion to such a degree that I just was not able to do my first move. I had to say: sorry for taking your time explaining this, but this is just tooooo much to think about, I quit!
So my rating is only based on what it says in the rating system: "Extremely annoying game. Won't play this ever again"
The way you choose what kind of action tokens your spaceship should produce each time was a nice mechanic though, that I would like to see used in a game that was not so damned complicated.

This is a completely souless exercise in logistics, patience, and managing chaos.  Most turns are short.  They consist of collecting a few colored discs.  Later, these discs are combined in loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong drawn out sequences in which players actually take a "real" turn.

The big problem here is that it is essentially a timing game, where you have to program your move for what feels like an eternity, and then get screwed and have to recalculate if you are a turn too late.  This dosen't necessarily sound bad, but when people take 30 minutes to reprogram it makes this game unbearable.

Terrible game.

Only one play, but was enjoyable.  The action/collect energy dynamic puts a nice tension between ship development and actions that score, and is also quite innovative.  It's definitely lighter than roads and boats, but not by a lot, and has a similar logistics theme with fewer dependencies, and more emphasis on developing good routes via two mechanics: privileges, and intergalactic highways.  The first gives you, and you only, an increase in efficiency in some part of the supply chain, and the second gives you a small savings in movement, which may be enough to tip a route into a more efficient pattern for you.

The scoring rewards moving up the supply chain far more than I like --it's simply hard to conceive the early routes having any value in their own right as the game progresses.

Weaker Splotter in some ways, almost a pure logistics/efficiency game.

More than many of their other games, I think DD requires a group that is willing and capable of longterm advanced planning...and one that won't throw a fit when that plan is inevitably thrown into chaos.

I like the whimsical theme of the economic goods.

Everyone's comparing this to Merchant of Venus, for obvious reasons, but a better comparison is probably Neuland.  I hated Neuland, though, and I like Duck Dealer (somewhat).  The logistics here are simpler to grok, and there seems to be a broader range of things you can do.  The simple but ingenius collect/spend turn system is a very elegant way of governing the pace of the game.  I also like the way that players can assert control over "their" part of the board with the cubes, making travel or trade in that region more efficient.

For those familiar with Splotter's previous games, Duck Dealer is closest in style to Roads & Boats.  But for me, Duck Dealer is much better because it's more streamlined.  The Duck Dealer board doesn't fill up with cardboard token diarrhea like Roads & Boats.  There's only one pawn that you're moving around the board.  You do have to plan ahead very carefully in both games, but unlike Roads & Boats, Duck Dealer doesn't snowball into a logistical nightmare by the endgame.  Duck Dealer also feels more interactive than Roads & Boats.  Players are much more likely to be stepping on each other's toes, racing for the best locations, collecting the lucrative bonuses for establishing new factories or markets, and milking the same trade routes.

On the other hand, Duck Dealer is extremely ugly, extremely expensive, and is bound to frustrate players who don't enjoy planning the long sequences of moves. It also rates low on replayability. I've played twice, and while both games were very enjoyable, I'm probably done.

This is a logistics game that has the usual collecting resources, building factories, upgrading resources and delivering them to consumers. Players spend most turns simply collecting energy disks until they decide to take an action and spend almost all of the disks collected in one turn. 

This truly feels like a Splotter game in that the system is wide open for manipulation without breaking and really encourages creative and opportunistic thinking. The downside to this particular design is that it might be a bit too much AP inducing. Because player interaction is fairly limited, you can almost whip out a calculator and figure out your optimum move each turn. Advanced technologies outscore basic goods by a factor of 10-1, so this basically becomes a race to the top and the first player to be able to leverage the advanced technologies will surely win, possibly lapping other players on the scoreboard. This is a bit disheartening as slight timing differences can lead to HUGE point swings, which isn't always that enjoyable.

The most interesting aspect of the game is that there are 24 actions to share between the players and it is first-come first-served. The tension lies in whether to claim and action now or build energy for a bigger action later, which risks taking fewer actions in the game as a whole.

Giving this one a 7 because I think the game is good, but I could just as easily give it a 6 if I focused on its weaknesses.

RATING: 6
As everyone has said, this is Merchant of Venus Splotter style. This was a bit harder to grasp initially though if for no other reason than it is so similar that you find yourself assuming too much, especially regarding the rules which are quite spartan to begin with. 

The interaction is very indirect and there is little need to be overly concerned about where, when, and what your opponents are doing. Much of your time is spent collecting energy markers for more robust actions to come. The game has long waves of silent calm with unexpected clangs of activity before returning to silence as if nothing happened.

I enjoy logistics. I have incredibly high regard for most Splotter fare. Here it’s just something about the combo of indirect interaction, large bouts of silence, and the efficiency for efficency’s sake that make this a less compelling romp than most of its siblings and contemporaries. Certainly not a bad game but not one I feel drawn to play further.

RATING: 7
Here we go again, another Splotter with lots to love and some serious drawbacks. 

This is the game I want to pull out when someone suggests something as run of the mill as Age of Steam or RRT. The forward planning in it, while intense, is over-exaggerated and not really a problem. What is a problem is that you only have a handful of "real" turns during the game, and there are only 7 significant scoring opportunities to be divided among the players. Duck Dealer is a very heavy but very streamlined logistics game, with four tiers of goods to be produced and refined. The last tier dominates the scoring. For example, you can take two basic goods and build a factory worth 10 points. You can take four basic goods, refine them into two second-level goods, and make a factory worth 50 points. 5 times the reward for roughly twice the work. That in and of itself would probably be fine, but with so few turns in the game everyone skips production/sales at L2 and L3. It feels weird to see an entire economic system spring to life and go largely unused. 

What do you need to know going into Duck Dealer?

1.) Every aspect of this game is derived directly from Avalon Hill's classic game "Merchant of Venus." Knowing MoV will make it easy to pick up the gameplay, even though in practice it's much different (zero randomness). 

2.) If you haven't played MoV, there might not be much of an attraction. You need to be able to plan large sequences of moves that will occur all at once. In MoV, you roll the dice 2-3 times to get where you're going before having a big turn with revenue. In DD, you spend 3-6 turns accruing "energy" of three types which are essentially action points in three varieties. Then, after substantial buildup, you spend 10-20 action points all in one turn. 

Overall, Duck Dealer is excellent if you look at each piece. The big picture is somewhat disappointing. The game earns a 3-4 hour playtime, but at the end the economy will feel woefully under-exercised. Planning fatigue will set in. The endgame itself is screwy (with leaders taking empty turns just to run the clock). I want this game to be better than I think it is. Rating is a soft 7. I would never play with more than three. I'll revisit at least once more.

Comments after one play.

This is essentially a pick up and deliver game.  Each turn in the game, you either pick up energy or take an action (spend your energy).  Because it is more efficient to do so, everyone collects a pile of energy and then spend it all at once.  The problem with this is that you have to chain together 20+ sub-actions, and that you might have to plan exactly what you are going to do so you can pick up the appropriate type of energy (there are three types: move, trade, and build).

So the turns where you do your actions take forever unless you have planned flawlessly.  It was usually the case that we screwed up somewhere and missed what we want to do by an energy or two.  Some people tried to back up and redo everything, while others just gave up and live with the mistakes, knowing that they are inevitable.

The game also has no rhythm, you are either taking fast turns ~1 second, or someone will be taking an action which takes 5-10 minutes.

Craig tried a tactic of setting up a goods run and optimizing it.  It showed us that this strategy is not going to work.  He went through a lot of work to get some small amount of points while William in one turn outscored his entire score by building a 50 point factory and a 50 point consumer demand.  It looks like the only viable strategy in this game is the 50 pointers.  Everything else is pretty much noise.

I also had problems with the items.  They were small pictures representing the items.  I couldn't tell many of the items, they looked like brown blobs to me.  It was difficult to distinguish the brown blob representing a linear accelerator from another brown blob.

I thought the "bootstrapping" part of the game was fun, upgrading different parts of the ship to achieve your ideal ship.  Also, trying to figure out what type of strategies work with different configuration of ship was interesting.  But it seems like you want to upgrade as soon as possible to a full 5 ship, but never go to a 2 ship because the it is just too inefficient to move.  Unfortunately this part of the game was over rather quickly.  The main incentive for me to replay this game is to try out different ship configurations.

I just picked this one up and was really looking forward to giving it a try.  After reading the rules, I now question whether or not buying it was a wise decision.  Most any title that's prone to cause AP (like "Neuland" or "Bump in the Night") just doesn't go over well.

Interesting complex economic logistic strategy game set in a bizarre parallel universe where trading of space ducks is a profitable enterprise. Similar, but rather satirical tech tree as in Roads&Boats. Only 24 actions during the game for all players, which makes gathering energy important and planning + timing of the actual actions crucial. **** Yes, I was one of those crazy 200 who bought one of the scarce copies of this game during the first 45 minutes after the opening of Essen in 2008 without having any clue about gameplay but purely based on hype, the name and reputation of Splotter. I am glad I have the game, but 60 EUR is a bit much for the content of this box. Are we really this different from those guys in the parallel world buying space ducks? I am wondering what they are doing with those blue stealth ducks ...

Indeed this game is Merchant of Venus meets Neuland, but plays almost as long as both combined. 

I think with experience that time could come down significantly but I'm just not certain that I want to play more than occasionally so it might never come down.

Further there are games that do this sort of thing better; one of which is their own design, R&B.

Better than it's given credit for even if it is butt ugly.

Splotter's take on Merchant of Venus.  I enjoy this one more, though it is fragile.  If players insist on taking actions that are smaller, the game will end quickly.  This is about planning.

Not sure about this one.  Reminds of Leaving Earth in that everything is an open arithmetic problem (wait enough turns before taking an action and you can get All The Points), but rather than testing to cause competition it presents a game of mental chicken.  I think I might prefer this to Leaving Earth with the right crowd, but I don't think my crowd is it.

Played slowly, a real brain burner, mainly because of that game of chicken in the background.  Being able to blink at the right time seems more on the other players than yourself, meaning this feels a little like multiplayer solitaire with random disaster events - think Weird Worlds.  It's basically the old drug/pirate/mafia game  where you buy low and sell high somewhere else.

Seems susceptible to cycling through a short trade run to chew up actions, although the thrill of making huge plays may mitigate this with certain groups.  Will need to explore using slower ships and what that does.

Definitely of two minds about the spaceship standees: in principle I like them and its good that they come apart to fit in e.g. a counter tray (needed for this game), but they're not very usable and tend to obscure the board.

Luckily I was early enough @ Essen...
And I'm glad to have found out it's worth the money!

Another brainbreaker in the Splotter tradition. Loads of stuff, lots to think about, so many possibilities... (The amount of chits is comparable with Antiquity)

Moaners will probably call it multiplayer solitaire, but I have to disagree: there's lot's of tension thanks to a constant urge to try to be the first to gain the big trade bonuses.

This game makes your brain hurt though, but in a good way...

The theme is ridiculous. But funny. I don't mind playing a twisted universe in which rubber duckies and blue paint are basic materials.

Just like any other Splotter game: NOT a game you should play with A.P. prone people. So far I played a couple of 2-player games in about 2 hours. Would like to play it with more so I'd have a little bit more time to think in between turns...

I like the pick up and deliver games usually. I like how the board develops in this game. What I don't like is how much planning there is. You are having to plan upwards of ten actions in advance, which can be completely undermined if someone else takes an action before you. I've only played once, but I get the impression that you don't necessarily want to wait too long to do an action, due to the chance of having your plans being completely crumbled.

Essen '11

Played once, it has a strange flow. You spend a lot of quick turns acquiring what are basically action points of three types, and then a pretty long turn using all the points. The strange combinations of goods made things needlessly difficult, as it wasn't too easy to remember which 2 things made this other thing. You do get used to that after a while though (but only for the goods you're trying to make/sell). We had a good time, but I think it could get dull with too many players (we played 2 player, and even then you're waiting for quite some time while the other player goes exploring in space).

This game was a dud for me. The way it works is you have a spaceship schematic, and a piece and a map of planets, and each planet produces a different basic resource. You get points for building factories that convert basic to adv resources and for delivering goods to customers who get strategically placed on planets when their needs can be met, and when the token becomes available. So far, I'm on board.

Where it lost me, is there are two types of turns in the game. Passing, to get action disks in one or more of the 3 colors matching the 3 actions you can take, or taking an actual turn which is spending your action disks as much as you want to do a million things. The game ends when 24 actual turns have been resolved collectively among all the players.
So the tension is supposed to come from how well you can math ahead your actions plus waiting too long means other players might take things out from under you and end the game prematurely.

But how fun is a game that's mostly, I take three disks, you take 3 disks, bob takes 3 disks, oh is a turn happening, looks like you miscounted your spaces and are now fucked. Boy that took awhile. Ok I take 3 disks.
To be completely fair to the game, some early game zipping around let's you add parts to your ship, which means you collect disks faster when you pass, but the downside is your ship moves fewer spaces with each move action, which is interesting in theory, but just makes the mathing harder and longer in practice

Duck Dealer is definitely a Splotter-esque game with a trade-tree, but this time takes it into a light-hearted approach of trading rubber duckies, phonebooths and stereos ,etc. It has some good mechanisms I haven't seen before so it doesn't have the "this game feels like that game" syndrome. It reminded me a Cannes at times, another Splotter game that was done in a humorous way. Lower playtime than Antiquity, Indonesia, and Roads and boats and the depth is less so as well, so it might hit the table more often, but we'll see.

I like this game, I hate this game at the same time.  The overall mechanic of pick-up and deliver, setting up factories and consumers is fun and interesting.

Maybe that gets easier with more play, but it seemed to suck the fun right out of the game tonight.

The rules are not terribly long, but somehow hard to absorb, with non-obvious strategic implications. (That's good in principle, but a barrier to entry.)

The one game so far didn't last too long, yet it felt long and tiring.

I'm interested to play again, but none of the 4 others wanted to. :/

The gratuitously weird resources and art are a stumbling block.

I think if I and my regular players were more into heavy thinky economic games, we'd enjoy playing this more.

The board of Duck dealer reminds me of the old game Star Traders. The idea of the game is also very similar. Each planet produces some resource. There are also planets producing improvements to the ships and it's possible to build factories producing more advanced goods. Different actions give different amounts of victory points. The new thing is the turn structure where players first collect tokens which can then be used during a turn. There are 24 turns in total and players can use up a turn with any amount of tokens. The mechanic is very interesting but planning and calculating how many tokens are needed to complete all actions that you want to do can result in some serious AP. I liked the game but it's not going to be a favorite of mine. I'll play it if somebody suggests it but I won't ask for it.

It is Merchant of Venus with all the fun stripped out.  Highly deterministic, and remarkably chaotic.  The return thresholds are bizarre, as profits are high for a player whose window of opportunity suddenly appears.  All strategy conceptually, until you realize that it is only a timing game, then suddenly it becomes completely tactical.  Playing with two players leaves some control, but with more you are just hoping for something to be available for you at the right time.  Scraps are highly profitable, so be sure to sit to the left of the guy leaving points out dangling.

It is a clever system, but this is just a dry and joyless systematic exercise, and this is coming from a guy that loves bone-dry economic games.

Oh, and the downtime...

The intro has some forlorn story of a duck leaving his family to go out into the cold depths of space.  He leaves his wife crying. It really paints a picture of the kind of entertainment that you are going to get from this.  The only reason why it gets a four is that it actually works and legitimately has great ideas.  It just makes you feel like you got air-locked (and not in a good way).

1 play, 3er.

This is Splotter's take on Merchant of Venus, crossed with a development tree like in Neuland/Roads and Boats.

Like MoV, you'll be moving your ship around the galaxy buying and selling goods and building things. Planets each start with a mine, which produces basic goods. You get VP for building stuff (factories, which convert goods into other, more advanced goods; space docks, which convert goods into ship improvements; consumers, which convert goods into VP) as well as for selling stuff (to previously built consumers). The goods are converted to better goods as in R&B: there's sort of a tech tree, and you have to haul the ingredients over to the factory that spits out the improved item, then haul that (and whatever else you need) to another factory to make an even better good, etc. Also like MoV, you move over dotted paths from location to location. Instead of rolling dice, though, you use movement points -- pay 1/dot or planet, unless you've placed a cube on the dot (sort of like having a yellow drive and skipping over yellow spots).

But unlike MoV, the game doesn't end by reaching some score target. Instead, there are 24 actions in the game -- mixed amongst the players as they see fit. On your turn, you either take one of those 24 actions, or collect energy. There are 3 types of energy -- red (movement), blue (trading), and yellow (building) -- represented by a limited supply of tokens. If collecting energy, you get one of any type, plus one per matching improvement in your ship. So many turns are very very quick: just collect energy.

When you take an action, you first get to place 1-3 tokens out on the dots for free (if you've used all 30 of yours, you can move previously placed cubes). Then you spend as many of your saved energy tokens as you like, building/trading/moving as you see fit (at the end of which you may only keep 4 energy tokens). Your movement energy tokens are each worth 2, 5, or 8 movement points depending on how big a ship you made for yourself (again like the various ships in MoV).

If you've saved a lot of energy tokens, you can take a loooooong turn! And since you can only save 4 energy for future turns, you really want to make sure you have just the right amount and combination of energy tokens. Which means that you plan, and count, and plan some more -- NOT for those prone to AP. With more players, each player will be able to collect fewer tokens before taking an action turn (if you take the last token of any energy type, you're forced to take an action turn immediately) so perhaps the turns wouldn't be quite as long. But if someone chooses to take more actions (and collect energy less often) -- more action turns = more free placements of cubes, and faster game end -- this may not work out, though, and turns may be long after all.

An interesting game, but I simply am not willing to plan to that level of detail; would much rather collect a bunch of energy, then wing it. Not sure the game is for me ....

Having owned Merchant of Venus since it came out in the 80's.  I played this once at BGGcon and was not impressed.  The eclatic feel of the goodw did not turn me on in the lease bit and everytime I tried to do anything I was scooped by the player in front of me.  Oh well.  I won't be picking up this one because I have the original and this one is not good enough to get it.

Another superficially complex route-building & pick-up-and-deliver game distilled down to a simple ruleset. Plenty of learning & discovering going on in our first play. Downtime didn't seem an issue for us: we were all too busy thinking to notice it.

There are so many problems from a gameplay and thematic design standpoint, it's hard to know where to begin.

-The tech tree is a meaningless hodgepodge of symbols. It's impossible to remember what makes what; it almost seems like a satire of a gaming tech tree.

-The downtime during the turns is among the longest in any game I've ever played. You could go make a sandwich and watch the local news in between some turns. 

-It's possible for one player to just swipe action cubes to shorten up the game, which I consider to be a mission of mercy.

A real miss.

Pretty neat game. I think I prefer this so far to my half-play of Merchants of Venus. I enjoyed the "charge" mechanic, where you take about 3-5 quick turns followed by a serious, longer one. I could see players over-thinking it and drawing the game out, but if it's not taken too seriously, the game can run pretty smoothly.

However, the graphic design is just terrible, and thematically it's silly in a way that didn't click for me.

Man like most other Splotter games there is a LOT going on in this game. You don't necessarily expect it from the title and box cover but there really is. Also like most other Splotter games it's going to take several plays to really get your wheels under you. 

I would like to say that this game is highly inspired by the older game Merchants of Venus. I mean I don't know for sure but there are so many similarities it just can't hardly be coincidence. Trading with planets and not knowing what the demand good is, Being able to make routes shorter. It's like you are playing MoV but all the crap that was wrong with that game is perfected here. So I don't mean this as a dig on the game but more as a nod to the fact that this game took what I liked and admired of that game and cleaned up what I hated about it. Well done.

Duck Dealer is not a bad game by any means and I’ve only played it once so I haven’t nearly explored its depths, but I didn’t feel the same sort of eagerness to play again and again that I felt with Antiquity and Roads & Boats (previous Splotter offerings by Jeroen Doumen and Joris Wiersinga). Antiquity is in my Top 10 and Roads & Boats in my Top 50, so saying that Duck Dealer doesn’t measure up is no criticism. There are plenty of great games that pale in comparison to those prior Splotter games. Duck Dealer demands an immense amount of advance planning by players. Antiquity and Roads & Boats are no walk in the park, but Duck Dealer takes the cake when it comes to requiring the careful mapping out of your turns an hour or two hence. Basically Duck Dealer consists of players spending most of their turns collecting energy (like the collection of train cards in Ticket to Ride). So most turns are very quick as players simply collect the energy discs that their ship’s crew can collect, which comes in three flavors: red (movement), blue (trade), and yellow (build). Eventually, someone decides that they’ve collected enough energy and decides to take an “actual turn,” which involves spending as much energy as they feel like to fly around the board, gathering resources, converting them into more valuable resources using the game’s technology tree, building factories, and selling their wares for victory points. The most novel and intriguing part of the game is the fact that it ends after 23 of these “actual turns.” But those 23 turns can be divided among the players in any way. You can build up an enormous number of energy discs and take only a very small number of major turns, or take more frequent, but smaller turns. In our game of four players, one player took only 4 turns, while another took 8 turns. But it’s not about how many turns you take, but rather how efficiently you spend your energy since everyone will gather roughly the same amount of energy. The key to the game comes in trying to plan where you’re going to fly your ship, what resources you’re going to gather, and where you’re going to build factories and sell your resources. This is the kind of game that could take 90 minutes with a quick group, but could easily take over 3 hours with a different sort of group. As with Chess, you could play for the moment, simply making moves that are easy to see, or you could try to plan many turns in advance, mapping out a long-term path. I suppose both games require flexibility to changed circumstances, but the time horizon of your planning is really up to you in either game. I can’t or simply don’t enjoy planning more than a couple turns in advance, so neither Chess nor Duck Dealer is really for me. I play Roads & Boats by the seat of my pants, building paper factories and mints wherever I please, and I suppose you could do the same thing with Duck Dealer, but it seems less feasible. On a tangential note, the components of Duck Dealer are rather embarrassingly bad. Certainly past Splotter offerings haven’t been particularly great (although I love the style of Antiquity and its overall look), but Duck Dealer takes it to a new level. The fact that both Duck Dealer and Planet Steam cost 60 Euros is telling because the latter is gorgeously produced (over-produced even), whereas the former is rather hideous by comparison. I wouldn’t let this stop me from buying a great game, but I just might let it stop me from buying an okay game like Duck Dealer.

There are some interesting things in the game, but overall it does not work very well. The flight system encourages massive analysis paralysis. The preferred customer mechanic makes it possible for someone to effectively lock in the most profitable trade chain - someone else could stop this, but at a significant cost to themselves.

Liked the concept a lot, but the game's just not for me.  My emotions through the game were: panic as I tried to plan what my next action turn should be, embarrassment as I kept the table waiting while I took that turn, frustration as I hit my energy limitations and dismay as I realised that my plan wasn't that good in the first place ... ok, that's overstating it a bit, but you get the idea.  I really did find it hard to keep my train of thought going while being distracted every few seconds by the little decision of what kind of energy to take.

Update after 2nd play: Planning ahead much easier, less frustrating, but still my action turn takes too long, and the only fun part is the theme.

RATING: 6.5
Clearly a good game. I liked it a lot and want to rate it a 9, but at the same time I wanted to rate it a 5. It has one clear design flaw(forcing massive ap-prone turns for best efficency) that makes it very hard to suggest playing it again(YMMV). Also not a chance in the world I would play this with any other player count than 2-3, the downtime would just be too extreme. But the upside is that it is a real brain-burner. Rules are very simple but actually playing the game well is really difficult in a good way. If the rules were redesigned for shorter turns every round instead of the few massively planned and ap-prone mega-turns this might work well, as it is now it just doesn't work smooth enough.

Awful game. Stupid "funny" theme. Poor components (appalling for the expensive price). Fiddly gameplay. Massive downtime. No, I did not lose - I won quite easily with twice as many points as most of the other players.

Should quite possibly be lowered to a "1" for being "broken" if I am right in thinking that this could be reduced to one big "shortest route" calculation for scoring the 50 point factories with the lesser scoring opportunities being a waste of time.

I completely get why many people don't like this game- programming long sequences of moves isn't everyone's idea of fun. Especially in our current era of board gaming where so many games are predominantly tactical and centered around the "micro-turn" (most worker placement games come to mind), Duck Dealer stands far apart.

At heart Duck Dealer is a game about timing; the tension is between waiting longer to take your turn in order to be more efficient versus seizing an opportunity on the board before the other players do. It is also a game about timing in the sense of controlling game length- a player that upgrades his ship is angling for a longer game while a player that doesn't wants to speed the game to an end once she gets ahead in VP. The fact that there's only 24 game turns to be shared amongst all players really brings this tension into focus. 

UPDATE: ultimately just too much work for what it is.

I like it.  I like the theme, and the fact that there's uncertainty thrown in that can wreck your plans.  It's called calculated risk.  Do you go for the small payouts or risk going for the perfect run that might not be there.  Some folks don't like this chaos and would rather be able to calculate everything out to a penny without any interference in executing their perfect plan.  That's not a game, that's a homework assignment.  The ducks and blue paint add character to the game.  For similar fun (but with more rules) try Merchants of Venus.

Comment borrowed from user toulouse:
"The problem with this game is the crazy length of turns that happens somewhat sporadically, and the limited amount of planning that can be done when it's not your turn. Because of the need to trade again and again and again on each turn, and to move several times, and to take/hand in various tiles/chits, it's a little overwhelming to do when it's your turn, and really painful to watch others do the same."

It's ok with people that don't plan too much ahead, but i can't imagine playing it with AP prone players. Might be a good play by email game, but can be boring face to face.

I think it's a good game that would deserve a higher rating, but regarding my limited desire to play it again, my rating might already be to high according to the BGG rating scale.

Similar to 18xx, in that it's fun when it's your turn, but there are long stretches when you have nothing to do and don't really need to be paying any attention.

Edit: played a 3-player game where all of us were avoiding thinking ahead too much and just saving up some energy, then figuring it out as we went along. Game played in under 90 minutes and was a blast. Rating upgraded from 6.5 to 7 and we'll be playing again.

2010-05-26: I like some of the notions, but for me, it was [thing=875]Roads & Boats[/thing] with all the joy sucked out of it.  But with a configurable transport that could be wound, and wound, and wound, and then turned loose with wads of potential energy stored up, which was a very interesting concept.  You get to play chicken to accomplish as much as you can on your turn, yet without yielding too much advantage by letting others claim things before you can get there.

2011-09-30: I want to try this again sometime, in a more optimal setting.

I like Bus.
I like Roads and Boats.

But, I could not like this game.
As always from splotter, this is very puzzle-like, long-downtime game.
But, in case of R&B, every step of technology advance make the game anew one by one.  On the other hand, this game could not give such refreshment during the course of the game.  This is very frustrating at least for me.

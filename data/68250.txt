Received this in C3i Magazine, and was pleasantly surprised. Basic rules and quick game play. I think this would be an excellent introduction to wargames while still being enjoyable for experienced players. Doesn't require much table space, so a game I'm going to bring along to the pub. I have yet to play against an opponent, so no rating yet.

RATING: 6
A very light introductory wargame that is highly portable and plays in about an hour. I like that Barbarossa is divided into army group sections. Unknown Soviet mech armor strength provides an interesting shake up to the typical hex & counter formula.

The only problem is that the game reveals its secret in the first play and there's not much that makes you want to come back for more.

RATING: 5
Standard hex and counter game. Too small to simulate the battle. Overall weak, but as an introductory wargame, it does the job. After 2 games, the replayability is very low.

RATING: 7
Fun! Fun! Fun! A step above "Battle for Moscow", since the rail movement makes the game more balanced between Germans and Soviets. The presence of air support to increase the battle odds are also an excellent feature that works great in this ready to play game!

If you are interested in this, get the GMT version with the magazine.  Why?  Because the VPG version is another example of how one gets "fleeced" when buying directly from them.  Good ideas are often found in VPG, but when will the pricing reflect the quality of components, or the quality of components meet the prices?

Surprising number of errors in the C3i version, but easy enough to fix them all.  Not sure the rules differences, etc., from Battle for Moscow (especially the revised 2.0 version) are worth it, but an interesting little filler game nonetheless.  The untried units are fun.  Played twice.

Un petit jeu bien réussi faisant suite à "Battle for Moscow" mais avec des règles juste un peu plus fines et nettement plus de manoeuvres que dans le précédent opus.
Les deux rôles sont intéressants à tenir car chacun peut avoir son mot à dire. Le joueur soviétique ne doit pas seulement subir mais mener également des contre attaques pour faire douter l'Allemand...Dommage que les pions du C3i 26 soeint moins gros que ceux du 25.

Simple, short wargame which can be used as a filler. Fun, I guess. It's like many of the small DTP hex-and-counter wargames out there, in that players' options are not that many and it's dicey. That's how I'd price it too. I certainly wouldn't pay $20 for it.

Normally I would rate this game a 7, but I bumped it up 1 to 8 for a special reason. The game itself is very simple. It is the most barebones hex & counter game I have ever played. The only chrome comes in the form of a special mechanized movement phase for Panzer Corps and Tank Corps. Although this may seem rather boring to veteran gamers, I find it a perfect introduction to the hobby for new players. So I always keep this game close at hand in case a friend expresses interest in the hobby.

TySome fun actually.  Reminiscent of the older SPI titles combined with a Micro-game. Good for a quick gaming session with a minimal footprint.  Lots of errata for a C3i game, with quite a few discrepancies between the rules and the map and the charts.

The second and best game in Chadwick's Barbarossa trilogy using a modification of the Battle for Moscow system.  This one focuses on Army Group South, and every difference from the prior game on Army Group Center (less German airpower, no first turn surprise rule, and more Soviet reinforcements and replacements) benefits the Soviets.  As a result, this title is better balanced than The Arduous Beginning.  The only negative with this title compared to its predecessor is that the cursory historical notes pale in comparison to those in TAB.

I played this game three times and each time the Soviets were just about cleard from the board! One game ended on a last turn counter attack by the Soviets to re capture a city and end the game in a draw.  I'm adding a house rule on the retreat rules ( retreat must be in the direction of communications if possible), and a rule for limited air support (turn one: 1 air unit, turn 2-7 one air unit on a die roll of 1-3 two air units on a 4-6). So far the above changes seem to be a help........

(I added the major city rule from the Moscow game as well, may take a step loss on a DR and not retreat when in a major city).

Even though I think the game needs a litte help, IT"S A BLAST!

It's a good game for introducing a total newbie to wargaming (playing the Soviets who seem to have somewhat easier time winning), but not too many reasonable strategies to try out. The terrain dictates the optimal moves somewhat, and if both players know what they're doing it's too much down to the die rolls. Still, some cool ideas, plays quick and is nicely portable. The misprints in the C3i edition are annoying.

I love these series of games, as they are easily taught to someone who has never played games before.  In addition, they remind of the games that I played in the 60s and the 70s.  Frank has done a great job making the game fun and playable.  Don't be fooled by that though, for if you don't come to the table with a strategy you will easily lose.

C3i version. Poor effort on the proofing front from GMT, various silly mistakes to be found.

The game is fine, though I'm not sure what kind of value it has for the sort of people who buy wargame magazines. Probably ok for new wargamers but there are better games for that. 

For some reason VPG rule books bore my pants off. Don't know why.

Objective: Kiev is an accessible game with simple, yet elegant mechanics.  For example, the sequence of play is different for the Axis and the Soviets to reflect their leadership and operational doctrine.  Also, the Soviet mechanized units start the game untried like in the classic game, Panzergruppe Guderian.  I played this solo twice and found the Germans had a tough time of it. Must play his again and do better!

一个入门佳作。本游戏规则简单，推演流畅，中心突出，很适合新手入门。游戏过程基本符合历史真实情况，比如苏联进攻加成，不能脱离EZOC等设计都让玩家不能用“后见之明”简单地完成推演。胜负则采用了常见的“比历史上表现得更好”的原则，玩家如果稳稳当当的作战，那么很容易打出平局（历史结果）。想赢就要创新、就要冒险；但是随之也会带来风险，给予对手机会，何去何从就要玩家自己抉择了！

Third game in the series, there is a lot of challenging terrain for the attacker to think about and for the defender to use. The Germans have a tough first few turns to get going. I think it will take a few games for me to try and play the German side better. 

In my game, I took a load of exchange results as the Germans, as in desperation to get the attack moving, I put in quite a few 2-1 and 3-1 attacks. as the attack ground forward the German attrition increased, making each hex fought for, a carefully considered matter - this is a very engaging game and plays well solitaire. 

So in conclusion, only one play, but I really like the game and the Kiev situation and terrain keeps the system fresh - it is a worthwhile addition to the series, look forward to playing again. (this is probably my most played series this year)

This could work as a first wargame as it's mostly basic rules with a few tweaks (e.g. two movement phases, only one attack through each hexside, untried units). There seems to be a decent amount of play before it will feel used up. I think it's tough on the Germans. VPG lays it all out nicely and gives us somewhat larger hexes.

RATING: 5
After 4 plays I gave up. There is something very uninteresting for me in this game. All 4 games I played varied wildly from one result to another, and my conclusion is that opening first two turns are critical. If axis immediately manage to run over russian mechs (very gamey move, as in first two turns they get attack bonus) they are safe from retaliatory attack. Now just mop up few infantries and run for right map border.

Russians on the other hand have simple task - run from forest to forest and around marshes trying to delay and spread axis units, with rare attacks to carelessly left weaker units caught in the open. He needs at least one gap open to allow for reinforcements.

I found this game lacking of any real strategy. There is one static objective so there is no planning ahead, just trying to exploit random battle results.

I like the rules and the components are ok. But replayability is non existing as I don't like finding best "map strategy" and finetune movement to perfection. I want to outwit my opponent, not draw on die rolls. Too much luck (and I say this as a miniature wargamer!), too little real strategy. Just small "hide in forest" defensive type patterns. I think system would boost tremendously with multiple objectives to victory.

And yeah, few cities are on the map border. With Russians got to play last, he just place few units there and immediatelly attacks for end game result!

Nice light introductory game. If the experienced person takes the Germans and the inexperienced person takes the Russians it will likely end with a suspenseful last turn. Definitely a luck factor to this one. But good for beginners or those without space or time.

Based on the C3i version

Components are as expected from a folio/magazine game (very solid).  Rules are simple - 4 pages and 1 of historical info/credits.

Gameplay is a simple I go/u go - where the challenge comes in for the Russians is trading space for time - since the Germans can only win by controlling all the cities (tie if the control 16 of 17.  The Russians are able to bring back in destroyed units and the Germans struggle to both mass attack power and protect lines.

Very portable and playable in an hours time.

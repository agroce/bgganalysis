A good filler to start or to end a game session. Fast paced card game that is fun and doesn't require a huge amount of brain power. Play and draw, play and draw.

Nice artwork. The cards are a bit sticky.

A classic example of a card draw game that plays itself. You build a set and out comes the locust, your largest set goes into discard. You build a set and the other player lays a larger set, all your set goes into discard. You have a hand full of cards but cant lay a thing, you speculate and the wrong card is turned up, etc etc etc.

Optimum plays are obvious but most of the time you just lay what you can. Ratio of luck: Skill 10:1. A futile exercise in shuffling cards.

Not to be played again.

I have played this game with gamers, friends and my parents and in-laws. In all cases, the game has been pretty well received. Decision points are not many, but a few will come up - what to plant, whether to trade cards for new cards or a new flood, or how to best make use of Speculate cards.

My gamer friends have generally liked this game as a light filler.

I like this game as a quick and easy conversation game - nothing too taxing, so I can chat while I play and the games end quickly - kind of a 21st century Euchre.

My non-gamers were split. My mother-in-law loved it, while my father-in-law saw it as a little pointless - no decisions. Of course, he lost every game we played, which suggests to me that he missed the decision points!

Simple and Fun. Better at Board Game Arena b/c I don't have to always be physically flipping cards. bought it at as a PNP for $2.99 at Drive Through Card Games. Good value!
Update: Just card flipping. Fine for 15 minutes with the kids, but that is about it.

Rather bland hand management game with a pasted on theme.

RATING: 3
This has so many things that I really don't like in a game: high luck factor of a random bad event, high luck factor of desperately needing a certain kind of card that doesn't come up for ages, player versus player screwage, one type of strategy, and obvious best plays.  It also doesn't include a lot of room to do anything when you get bad cards, which is something that can redeem a good card game.  I think it stinks, though it works mechanically and may be fine for some people.

Light family type game. Ok filler material.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Bah. Simple game that seems to be in the same family as Bohnanza and plays fast. Not too many decisions to be taken means that it almost plays itself, especially since the players are at the whim of the cards in a big way. The Flood mechanic is somewhat interesting, but combined with a random hand of cards means that the players have very little control.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rating after one play of what is a very interesting and good game.  I actually got screwed by card draw in that I saw a single flax for the ENTIRE game (barring the very last turn of the game, by which point it was too late).  Luckily I managed to plant and harvest it and won on the tie break as we all had 1 as our lowest score and my next lowest was 3 (and would have been 4 had I not done ridiculous trading right at the end in a desperate and ultimately futile attempt to find some sodding flax).

If this plays well with 2 I might pick up a copy myself and the rating may well go up.

NILE is one of the best simple cardgames I have played in a very long time.  I have played with 2, 3 and 4 players.  It scales well in that range but I'm not sure I want to try it with 5.

It's Fast.

It's full of interesting choices.

It's Fun.

Great game!

Sleve the Cards immediately.

I play a modified version of this game, changing the theme to a more local flavour. Also I modified some restrictions to make the game more fluid, but the core mechanic remains untouched.

On general I like this game, it entertains me more than other regular card games, even though it depends more on luck and anything else. 

The winning mechanic is unique and is frequent that the winner is unexpected.

RATING: 6
A light card game that reminds me a bit of Bohnanza and Ingenious.  You can plant fields and harvest when the Nile floods at the beginning of the round.  Harvested goods score you points.  Your lowest scoring good is your high score. You can also speculate and there is a plague of locusts that wipes out the biggest field.   

The game is very light with some ok decisions where you play probabilities.  The card quality is a bit mixed.  It has linen finish but the finish seems to peel from the sides.  

An ok game that is a relatively quick filler.

good but newer version seems better

rules arn't that intuitive for how cool the game's concepts are

fast and simple once you learn it
winning relays on luck and the final turn or two too much.  Only reason that doesn't turn the game to crap is because of the speed at which a game is played.  It takes a bit of bluffing to get just right too.

the quality of my version was actually crappy, the box wasn't held together, the cards are practically home made with how they stick, bend, and seem to be pealing apart after one play.  I'm actually lowering my rating because of this, thats how impactful it is.

RATING: 6
A nice, fun game if you accept the luck factor as part of the territory. Maybe less of an issue with less than 5 players. Perhaps best with 3-4 players. Rules could be a bit clearer but once you go through the first round its pretty clear and plays very fast. Great artwork but the quality of the cards is an issue. Just not sturdy enough and get damaged quickly. Nice mechanics with trumping what has been planted by others and then the locusts hit hard. I quite like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, quick little card game - at least with two. I'm very reluctant to try this with five. But as a 10-minute filler with two, good fun.

The card art is great, but the quality of the cards is awful. They bend and break immediately when shuffling. Some cards were marked before the first game! Sleeve immediately.

Suggest (though prefer the DeLuxor edition)

Simple, casual cardgame with a mechanic that is different enough to make it enjoyable, even though it's not got much strategic depth. I hate the final scoring system, though--it's great that it requires you to diversify your crops, but it's still frustrating to play a whole game and end up with a final score of zero or 1 (and be beaten by a score of 1 or 2), which happens a LOT.

[b]Nile[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Nile is a game I had heard of years ago, but never managed to play. After finally playing I found Nile to be an excellent set collection game with a high degree of player interaction. For some reason the whole time I was playing all I could think of was that Nile was a much better version of Bohnanza even though the games are quite different. My comparison is based solely on the fact that you are planting crops, after that the games diverge completely. While I find Bohnanza to be a long, tedious game, Nile has great pacing and remains tense until the end. What sets Nile apart from a lot of other set collection games is how scoring works. Similar to Tigris and Euphrates, you are first scoring the crop you have collected the least of and working backwards towards the crop you have the most of until you have a winner [i](in short you'll win by having the most of your least harvested crop)[/i]. 

Nile would be an excellent game for families; it appears that [thing=93971][/thing] is the most recent edition and it also comes with an expansion [i](which I know nothing about)[/i].[/i]

12/18/11 - I could see this game replacing Bonanza for me. It plays quicker, in my opinion and the locusts card can open up crops previously closed. The card quality was bad as several cards showed wear and the owner of the game only played it a few times. I was told a newer version is due out made from better stock. I also didn't care for the art work. I think this would work nicely as a couples game. I rank it a 7 at this time.

[Minion Games 2010 edition] {Filler, Egypt; hand-management; optimal 4p} Nile attracts me because of its Egypt theme and it's a hand-management filler.  Players try to collect as many cards as possible from the 5 commodities.  It is quite luck driven but players can increase their chances of gains with smart plays.  Player interaction is good.  In all, a surprising fun and fast filler.

Nice game!  Unless you're counting everyone's harvests carefully, a "hopeless" situation can be a lot less lopsided than it looks... especially because you can pilfer your harvests to fish for cards....

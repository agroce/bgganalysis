1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Clever system of giving each player a single direction function, and disallowing any vocal or visual map references.

DISLIKE: Chaotic, and too easy to speak accidentally.

OVERALL: I'm not the target audience for this game, but it's clever enough for an occasional play. I wish there were a larger variety of unique player roles.

The biggest achievement of Magic Maze is that for once we have here a co-operative game which does not suffer from alpha players. That is because you are not allowed to talk and the team has to learn to work together in silence. Racing against the time is fun and post-game speculation is even more fun. 

But that is where the fun ends. The nature of the puzzles you are trying to solve is not the most interesting IMO. You are just moving pieces to certain spaces on the board and that is it. In the end it becomes a question how quick each player realises that it is their time to move. Personally I would have liked to see puzzles requiring more wits.

A not for me type of game. I played it and I hated the experience. I dislike the real time aspect, it stresses me out, I think the tiles are too small, making it difficult to see the color of the exits for example.

If you like real time games, I believe it is quite good. The scenarios are getting more difficult every time and you learn to step up your game really fast.

Let me say it in German. Please use google translator and have fun with it.

Es mag ja innovativ sein, beim Spielen nahezu nicht mit den Mitspielern kommunizieren zu dürfen. Für ein kooperatives Spiel ist das aber schon sonderbar, muss man doch kooperieren, fast ohne sich verständigen zu dürfen. Man muss also nicht nur die Übersicht haben, was welcher Pöppel tun soll, worauf die Mitspieler mit ihren Aktionen hinaus wollen und wann wo die eigene Aktionsfähigkeit für welchen Pöppel gefragt ist, sondern man muss das auch noch in einem engen Zeitkorsett bewältigen. Will man auch nur eine Spur von Chance haben, das Ziel zu erreichen, hat man sehr, sehr wenig Zeit zum Überlegen. Für meine Spielrunde mit mindestens anderthalb Grüblern ist das schlicht nichts. Versucht man wirklich, sich an den vom Spiel vorgegebenen Zeitrahmen zu halten, ist das einfach nur anstrengend und eher frustrierend. Spielspaß kann da wohl eher nur eine Spielgruppe von Blitzdenkern haben. Wir machen es deshalb so, dass wir zwar die Sanduhr laufen lassen, aber mit deren Ablauf das Spiel nicht beenden, sondern die Zeit stoppen, die wir zusätzlich brauchen und uns daran "messen". Da das so geht, wenn es auch nicht der Sinn der Sache ist, noch 4 Punkte.

Überraschung des Jahres! Die Regeln sind schnell erklärt, danke Einführungsscenarios. Dank der einfach gewählte Symbole und der klaren Farbgebung bleiben bei der Orientierung während des Spiels so gut wie keine Fragen offen.
Es geht chaotisch zu und manch einer platzt fast vor Untätigkeit wenn die Sanduhr dem Ende zu geht.
Schöne Idee das eigentliche kooperative "Reden" zunächst aus einem Kooperationsspiel zu verbannen. Es funktioniert wunderbar. 
Wir haben es schon mit einiges Leuten spielen dürfen - alle haben sich den Titel aufgeschrieben und möchten es sich kaufen.
Klare Empfehlung!

A nice cooperative "run the maze together" game which provides a very quick pleasant cooperative experience.  It deserves the attention it is getting as a good family game. 

I would rate the game a 7 if the boards were printed more clearly.  Since speed is of the essence at times in the game, the portals, escalators, exits and weapon caches really need to be printed more clearly and distinctly on the boards.

This is a frenetic and fun short game - work together to beat the timer but no talking and your role changes throughout the game. I like the way it teaches you to play with each new scenario introducing a new rule. We've had the most luck in 2 player mode and solo mode is ridiculously hard to win. This game won't be everyone's cup of tea and not really a casual game because, although short, it does take some dedication to learn.

Quick and frenzy little co-op filler..The 3-10 mins it takes for a game (setup included) is filled with fun, laughter and frustration towards your teammates that will prove dummer that you'd think - or is it just you? - but with the occasional stress that any real time game provokes. Component quality is ok (tiles are of good quality with a few corrections needed artwork-wise in order to more easily identify stuff on the board, the pawn are meh and the sand timer can stick from time to time, making it the weakest link of this game). All in all a great realtime game that is fun, engages everyone, completely gets rid of the alpha gamer syndrome..what more to ask for.

Played this game over a gaming weekend and found it to be a blast. The no talking, no hinting aspect of the co-op genre was fun. I can tell you that the pawn used to let someone know you need them to do something probably took more abuse than needed. When the timer is fading it can become quite frantic.

The setup and time to play is very quick. If you need an ice breaker or filler game this is perfect. We easily played three rounds in a row while waiting for other players to finish what they were doing.

This is fantastic twist on the real-time cooperative genre. You have to collaborate with your group because you each person has particular actions only they can do. The trick is you're not allowed to talk to each other and communication is mostly limited to a giant red pawn that you can put in front of people to "remind" them they have something important they have to do. With a sand timer that is constantly running, the frantic nature of this game is crazy fun. The game is also set up so that as you complete scenarios, it will add more rules and more map tiles to explore so it stays fresh.

Playing a (cooperative!) game without being allowed to talk kind of feels like eating a chocolate bar without being allowed to even taste it: it’s an abomination, a torture, a sadistic whim that goes against nature.

Such is Magic Maze: I like the chaos it provides, sure, but I cannot enjoy the remaining game since I cannot have fun if I’m not allowed to banter, joke, comment, discuss with the other players as the game goes on. Central to my experience is meeting the other players and socializing with them under the pretext of playing a game, not playing or winning the game itself.

And yet the ban on talking is central to Magic Maze, it’s what makes the game: without it, Magic Maze would sag like a ball that leaked all the air it held to the nothingness it actually is.
But still, I cannot see anything fun in the unnatural way it forces you to play and behave.

Even more so, some players told me they felt «repressed» when playing this game: they said that being forced to shut up and don’t vent immediately their comments or complaints during the game made them kind of angry and likely to turn small annoyances into full-scale arguments as the game was over.
Which also shows why Magic Maze completely missed the mark.

Juego cooperativo de descubrimiento y escapar de una mazmorra (en un centro comercial), en el que cada jugador dispone de una acción y debe estar atento a cuando conviene aplicarla.
La novedad y el atractivo del juego es que todos los jugadores juegan simultáneamente y no hay turnos. Además, no se puede hablar entre los jugadores.

Lo conocí en las CLBSK17 y me gustó tanto, que me lo compré días despues.

No, there will be no pun with how a-maze-ing this game is...

But it is. I preordered it and was able to test it after that. We played it one round after the other.
This is one of the best Spiel-des-Jahres contestants that I've seen.

It is simple to get into but with following scenarios it gets more complex over time. Not favourite game material but it is pretty cool.

Here is an original cooperative game, fun to play, easy to learn and, rare enough to be mentioned, really involving all the players into the decisions. Indeed, as you can't speak, each player have to stay focused, to trust each other, and the red pawn might help to "overcome" any issue you may have with a co-player ;)

This is a really weird game. The first time you play it's pretty fun as you laugh at how bad you did. However, additional plays are very unpleasant. It's a complete quiet activity, where you come off feeling like a dumb A.I. autoplaying the terrible puzzle; with nothing memorable to take away. They should simplify the rules, remove the timer and "no discussion" and market it to little kids. #trash

RATING: 6
A neat real-time puzzle game with a multitude of difficulty levels to keep things fresh. The shtick is that you're trying to maneuver 4 pawns around the board, achieving goals with them along the way. However, one player can move pawns north, another south, another east, and another west, with the additional caveat that they can't communicate, other than placing a big red pawn in front of a player who you want to do something (but you can't tell them what you want them to do).

There's also a timer involved which puts just enough pressure on things to add the right about of stress (the fun kind!).

Not sure how many plays this would remain exciting to me, but overall, I thought this was fun the couple of times I played. Might be fun to pull out once a year or so.

A game of frequent nervous giggles and persistent dread. Although it is a lot of fun, I get a headache every time I play. Also, it's important to realize beforehand that your friends (at least the ones who can't read minds) are going to frustrate you. It's inevitable. And to judge by that angry "Do Something!" pawn they're tapping in front of you, the frustration is mutual. Some players will giggle in this circumstance. Others may never want to speak to each other again. Consider your group carefully before you open the box.

Okay, so this game may not have the best replay value (it's scenario based), it may be a little easily "solvable", and it may be a bit too shallow for repeated plays within a short time frame... but DAMN if it isn't just pure fun. You'll laugh. You'll yell (when it's over). You'll want to wring your friends' necks (when you're playing). Magic Maze belongs in the elite category of extremely accessible, extremely interactive games with a high novelty factor - the kind of games that you can bring anywhere and play with anyone, the kinds of games to show people how different board games can be from their perceptions, the kind of games that get people into games.

What a great co-op game with a ridiculous theme. You are fantasy heroes that have lost your weapons and need to go to the mall to steal new ones. A similar idea to Escape Curse of the Temple where you need to get out in a certain period of time, but executed so much better in my mind. Everyone gets a subset of all the actions and you have to work together to get the pawns to their respective stores and then out of the exit with no communication other than a pawn to indicate when someone should go and when you get to one of the limited sand timer spaces you can talk until the next move. The game comes with 17 scenarios, 7 to learn the rules and 10 more variants. We've played scenario 1 one time and scenario 3 three times and are 3-1, definitely think it is time to up the difficulty. Such a good game and produces so many good moments in a short period of time. Highly recommended!

RATING: 9
What a fun, unique game.  In some co-ops, you can succeed with a good leader and a few weak links.  Not the case here - to win, everyone has to be on top of their game.  The flow of gameplay builds tension to a head (since no one can communicate their feelings, verbally or nonverbally), until a point where all the tension is released at once (either in gleeful jubilation or frustrating defeat.)   

Warning: don't play with a group that is bringing in emotional baggage with each other from outside the game - oh man, will this game amplify it!

If this rating seems tepid, please bear in mind that:

a) I don't care for realtime games;
b) I am not overwhelmingly interested in fantasy themes;
c) I am not generally amused by humor that bases itself in nerd-cult archetypes if it doesn't actually DO something funny with them;
d) I'm not super-hot on coop games.

If you're unlike me on at least one of these four points, consider this a solid endorsement.

RATING: 4
A hectic real-time coop with the added complexity of not being allowed to talk to other players. Once you get into the rythm of who can take what action (as players can only carry out specific actions so there has to be An Understanding in who does what) not talking sounds like a recipe for disaster with hands all over the board and knocking over pieces. With generous splash of heated discussions à la [i]WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT, YOU OAF[/i] at the end. The back story is too ridiculous for words: a party of fantasy figures is raiding a supermarket to grab the gear they need for their next campaign: they can't buy the gear because of 'setbacks' in the previous campaign. Once the gear has been located in a maze which constructs itself en route ('fog of discovery') the alarm goes off and you have to run to the exit as quickly as possible. Whereas in the beginning you can use magical portals to move throughout the shopping center you will have to move quite normally to the exit: the alarm magically disables those portals. 

It sounds as ridiculous as it plays, but apparently that's what sells in 2017. Real-time designs are not my cup of tea, but I will happily admit that the rate goes up with 1 point per 2 glasses of wine and/or heavy beer consumed.

Real-time limited-communication cooperative maze-running. The group's jointly controlling four heroes; each player has one or two actions - like "move West" or "Explore" that they can take with any hero, but that's all they can do, and opportunities to talk are limited.

I played the intro PnP scenario twice with two different groups. Mostly it was "fun but not super-compelling" - except once, for about 90 seconds towards the end of one play, we got into this rhythm, all in the same groove, and it was [i]great[/i]. I could imagine that with more experience (and, especially,  a playgroup that's played together multiple times) one might hit that "almost reading each others' mind" group-flow-state, which would be really neat.

(The additional considerations / powers of scenarios beyond the introductory one might also add interest through variety.)

What a frantic game !
Played several games from 5 to 8 players and every time it's a "noisy" mess.
Despite the fact you are not able to speak, knocking several times the token in front of a player becomes the repetitive noise heard from people outside to the game "yes darling we are playing the toc toc toc game" lol).
Rules are simple to start with and additional are gradually added, which is a nice way to learn the game.
Basically everybody has the same goal but the same way of seeing how to go there and without speaking it becomes a big mess, but a nice one.
The downside of this stress and having to manage everything at the same time, is it requires quite some energy, we never play more than 3 or 4 games in a row (even if they are quite short, around 10 minutes) because it's an exhausting game :)

Very nice mechanic. Totally opposite to what Escape The cursed temple is.

It is very fun with 4+ players.

I've found that the game is more fun with clumsy, relaxed, forgetful people. 

If you try this with too serious, calculate-every-move, super concertrated cold people, the game is very easy to solve, and you will find yourself quietly moving pieces to the obvious place where they need to be.

Fun real time game, simple enough to be a family game or gateway game (gateway to what though). I enjoyed it quite a bit, but only for what it is, it's massively group dependent and I can imagine many gamers being allergic to real time games. It won the spiel over Knizia's Quest for El Dorado, which is also suited for families and is by a country mile a vastly superior game. The theme I find obtrusivesas it makes teaching the game slightly off, the characters represent standard fantasy tropes, fine; but they are shoplifting from a modern day 'mall' with escalators - why?

Magic Maze is my favourite real-time game that I've played so far.  Now, while I haven't exactly played a huge amount of them so far, I can still easily see this one staying at the top of the real-time game stack for me. The premise is that you have to have four pawns explore various tiles (ala Escape) and get to four destinations and then another four destinations. The trick is that any player can move any pawn, but each player can only move them a specific way and most of the game, you're not allowed to talk. The main way of communication is placing a large red pawn in front of another player. I love this! It doesn't have the crazy rolling of dice, which can be problematic on hard surfaces and is not a disturbance to other nearby gamers (ala Happy Salmon & Pit). Oh, did I mention you only have 3 minutes to meet your objectives? Well, that's kind of a lie. You do have 3 minutes, but there are various spots on the board that will allow you to flip your timer one time each. After you flip the timer, you're allowed to communicate until someone takes an action. Then it's radio silence again. The rulebook does a good job of easing you through all of the mechanisms in a series of scenarios that gradually introduce game elements. I can see this game not being for everyone, but I really like it. I'm not the only one, as it's currently nominated for the Spiel Des Jahres. Definitely give this one a look!

A blast of a game. I would say the maximum player count is 6. It got pretty messed up with 8, since all players were not 100% in the game. And we had to be pretty cramped up together.

Shines with 3-6 players. Fun, hectic, stressing. Players have to be able to laugh at themselves and forgive the brain freezes of others.

A few complaints: 
1. My copy was missing the 3min timeglass.
2. I think the components are quite cheap. Especially the pawns and their STICKERS, which don´t attach to the pawns. The icons should have been painted on the pawns.

This is yet another game that contributes to me no longer saying that I don't favor co-ops.  Such an interesting yet simple idea.
One of the things I commend the designers for is including so many levels and options in the base game.  In some cases these could have been withheld for promos and expansions, but having them included gives the game depth and adds replay value.  Glad it was found by SDJ for nomination!

The most 'silent fun' that you can possibly have!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love it.  This is a great fun, quick, novel co-op.  Very little setup or teaching time.  Attractive.  

You mostly can't communicate, so have to play constant attention to what others are doing and avoid pulling in different directions with individual plans.  A pushy quarterback will probably still be a problem in this game, as with most co-ops.  If one player is significantly less attentive or slower than the others, it may frustrate - the game offers no way for others to assist that player.

Despite the various scenarios given in the rulebook, this feels like it's going to be quicker to master than Escape: Curse of the Temple was, so I wonder about longevity.    
I can imagine a few interesting expansions and variants: Perhaps adding roaming security guard(s) like in Burgle Bros; treasures and curses, a la Escape..., or anything that adds unpredictability and bit of push-your-luck as an option for a really desperate team.  Anyway, if you play with multiple groups then the novelty of the base game will anyway be appreciated anew by each group. 

It feels different enough from Escape... that I would happily own both (and likely will).  I would have loved a bit more of the theme in the mechanics.  It just feels like "green has to go to the green A, then exit at the green B".  (In Escape..., in contrast, I could believe Indiana Jones was placing gemstones, getting momentarily waylaid by snakes (why did it have to be snakes?), and other curses, and only just squeezing out of the temple before the ceiling descended.)  I'd also have loved to have seen a couple more 3d components, just models on standees to represent the key features (shops and exits), to make it easier to find those key things at a glance on the otherwise 2d board.  Even in good lighting, our group members could be seen tilting their heads at the board, trying to find the yellow exit, or spot the security cams.

Rated 9/10!  Opinion is after four sessions (12 great plays with 4 players, 9 great plays with 3 players, and 2 "meh" plays with 7 players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty unique experience even for a real-time coop. Each player can move the pawns in one unique way and one special power. The catch, of course, is that players cannot speak to one another nor point. The only way they can communicate is to tap a totem in front of a player to indicate he/she needs to do something. 

Between the need for coordination of moves and the special powers (such as putting out a new tile when appropriate), there's a lot to distract a player. Pretty soon someone is tapping that damn totem in front of you in a frustrating manner and the tension really heats up. Moreover, there are different levels of complexity to play at so you can grow into the game at your own pace. 

I've never been much a fan of real-time games (never liked Space Alert), yet I enjoyed this one and look forward to the next play. If your group likes coops and is OK with real-time games, you should check this out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is mechanically very simple; get in, explore, grab what you came for and bail.  The catch is you don't have control a single piece, you are collectively controlling four pieces along with your team, you can only perform certain actions i.e. move in a certain direction(s) or perform certain action(s)... without communicating, oh, and did I mention, there's a timer involved?

Magic Maze is a challenging and deeply involving game which has fantastic scenario based missions that ramp up and add rules and challenges incrementally; the games difficulty grows with the players, this prevents it from becoming stale or a pushover; combine that with modular tiles instead of a board and there seems to be a lot of replayability in the box.

This game is an intense burst of hyper-focus and synchronisation where your team will either work in a beautiful harmony, or lockup and choke.  You want a group of players who are sharp and focused to make progress in this game.

On a side-note: This game will confound any random passer-by’s who do not know anything about the game.  It will raise questions such as...  Why are these people so quiet, but intensely frantic?  Why are they banging a giant pawn on the table?  Why is everyone moving every piece?  Are they even playing a game?

Definitely a quite funny game with quite a lot of enthusiasm around the table. It's interesting that you cannot speak (same feeling as in Hanabi) when you really want to speak. However, I think the game was maybe a little bit too easy to feel real stressed. When that said, I have only played Scenario 1 and 2, so I guess it will be more challenging with other scenarios. We didn't get that "Yes, we did it" response after game end. Rating might go up when playing scenario 3 and up.

I am going to have nightmares about that red dobber [microbadge=12553] being tapped on the table in front of me! I didn't know what you meant when you placed it and I still don't know now you are impatiently tapping it in front of me

This game is so stressful! Each player has a certain direction they can move any of the pawns in but you are not allowed to talk so you place the red dobber, [microbadge=12553] the DO SOMETHING pawn [microbadge=12553], in front of someone when you are waiting on them to make a move, and its all in real time and there is a sand timer and the action (direction) you can do shifts each time you get more time so what you do changes and everyone is getting impatient with you and more and more rules are added

Nagyszerű coop partyjáték. Tipikusan "ez miért nem nekem jutott eszembe" darab.

Magic Maze is a real-time cooperative puzzle, not entirely unlike Escape - The Curse of the Temple or Space Alert, but focussing more strongly on the real-time frenzy and less on the problem-solving parts than the latter. Pretty light, appropriately frantic and with a scenario system that slowly introduces the more "advanced" features. Nicely done.

Interesting unique mechanics, that eliminate the alpha player problem and make Magic Maze a really innovative and fun gaming experience!

Meh. I don't want to slight the game too much, because it's actually got a lot of nifty things happening for it. But I found the game kind of annoying and didn't really like the co-operative real-time aspect. I do wonder if games like this are for me. Probably not, which is why I'm trying to be fair about my impression. If I have any real fault to throw against this game, it's that the ever-growing board gets more and more difficult to read as all the colours and symbols become quite a mess, and you have to race to scan the board a bunch of times to find what you need and where you going to need to go. 3D tokens for the important areas could have been helpful, but maybe the designer didn't want this? Perhaps some of the "fun" is supposed to come from not being able to keep track of where everything is when you're on a time constraint. I just didn't find that fun. I also found it annoying having several players having to push a little token around at the same time due to the movement cards. Again, this is part of the game and maybe part of the fun for some, but not for me. Cute idea though and everything works as it should. This is obviously a game some enjoy and there isn't anything quite like it out on the market. For that, it at least deserves being played by folks to see if it's the kind of game they enjoy.

It's a fun little game. I love real-time games because they're short, focused experiences that shouldn't ever be boring while playing. I don't think it's the best real-time game (that would be Captain Sonar) but I think it's unique enough to have in my collection. It's not as stressful as Escape because you don't have constant upkeep, so you can focus more on the board and what needs to be done. What gives you stress in Magic Maze is the other player's expectations of you and that is so much more interesting. The plethora of difficulty levels is necessary since you really do improve with every game, but that may cause issues when trying the game with new people and I'm also worried if the game will have staying power as we move through higher difficulty scenarios.

EDIT: After trying harder difficulties I'm happy to report that it gets much more interesting as you get better at the game.

An improvement on other real time co-op games but it still fell flat for me. After the first couple of plays I feel like I don't need to play the game again. The theme...well, doesn't really make any sense, nor did I feel the mechanics related to it. I guess there are somewhat fantasy themed mall images on the tiles but they are so small that you don't really see them unless they are closely inspected (and you have no time to do this during the game).

RATING: 7
Components: good tiles
Complex: really easy
Weight: family
Players: more than 4
Length: around 15 mins playing, another 15 talking about the game
Mechanics: tile laying, moving pawns...
Decisions: well, not much indeed, just need to see where to move the pawns
Opinion: starting that this game is about a barbarian, an elf, a wizard and a dwarf entering a mall to steal their weapons.... doesn't that sound amazing?
Love the theme, and really liked the gameplay.
I'm not on cooperative games, mainly for the alpha player, also I need someone taking the win, but there are some out there that really captives me. This is of those.
Really simply rules, and lot of fun. While trying to do your stuff, each of the players have some special powers (or just one, depending in the number of players), these powers are to move north, south, east.... because you don't have a pawn, you have the power to do something with those pawns. As said, as you try to do your stuff.... you cannot talk!!!! yes, this is forbidden.
The only way of interaction (lets say, telling others what to do) is staring at them or placing a Big Token in front of. And you have 3 mins to steal and run away!!!! well, you can move the clock back and gain some more time.
Should I say more about this game?

Hilarious and frantic game, after beating the first scenario we immediately started playing the second one. The cover is not particularly appealing, but the mechanics are innovative yet at the same time easy to understand. The first time we played everybody was confused, the second time the experience was easier. The theme is a bit bizarre (barbarians and mages stealing from a shopping mall?), but while playing you don't really have time to think about it. There are no turns as such, you do whatever you can in the best possible way and hope for the best (this is, that other players will understand what you are doing - and that YOU will understand what your friends are trying to achieve). Since time is limited, panic and confusion ensue.

I'm not sure whether this is just a novelty game (like Captain Sonar) or whether it has staying power as a filler, but right now, I'm really enjoying this, both solitaire and with others. The game is difficult enough to be a challenge but not so difficult that it's unbeatable.

The real innovation here is the big red "do something" pawn. What a wonderful way to both curb quarterbacking tendencies AND give an outlet to frustrated quarterbacking that the whole table can enjoy.

Really fun real-time co-op game where the players can't communicate with each other, except by tapping a "Do something!" token on the table.
The game is about fantasy characters who go to a mall to steal gear and run away before the time runs out. 

Yes, the theme is weird. I guess they wanted to make a game about stealing, and added the "fantasy" layer so it wouldn't sound as wrong. People will buy anything with a fantasy theme, it seems.

The gameplay is very interesting. Nobody is a specific character, you can move each character but only in one direction, or activate a skill.  It's almost as if someone broke a videogame controller into pieces and gave each player one or two buttons. This really makes everyone work together to move.

We only played the first four levels, but there are seventeen! The complexy increased in a steady way, and we were forced to adapt on the run. It's a lot of fun.

This game sounded stressful when explained and was kind of stressful to play but was strangely appealing at the same time. That's just with the initial couple of games too. The ongoing addition of new rules and restrictions will likely make this more stressful, but for some reason I still enjoy it, unlike Captain Sonar which feels stressful and not enjoyable.

Nagy hype van körülötte, alig várták sokan a magyar kiadást. Nekem most (2017.08.23.) sikerült vele játszanom. Egyet játszottam vele, de az bőven elég volt, nem értem miért ez a nagy lelkesedés a játék iránt. Az Escape volt a játék alapja és azt szeretem, annak jó a hangulat, magával ragad a kocka dobálása, az izgalom, a kiabálás, de itt nincs mi magával ragadjon. Eleve rendkívül hülye a háttértörténet: hősök (törpe, varázsló, barbár stb.) a plázában lopnak. Hogy ki, hol, mit csinál? 
De ettől még gondoltam lehet jó, hiszen szeretem az Escapet, szeretem a kooperatív játékokat, de ezt mégsem szerettem meg. Ezt egy csapatépítésre tudnám elképzelni, hogyan kell a csapatnak összedolgoznia, hogy a részcselekedetekből meg legyen az egész, vagyis hogy mozgassuk a megfelelő helyre a négy bábut, hogy mindenki csak egy fajta bizonyos mozgást végezhet, miközben nem mutogathatunk vagy beszélhetünk közben. 
Az Escapenek parti játék jellege van, ennek is annak kellene lenni, de az számomra nagyon nehéz némán. Egyáltalán nem tudtuk beleélni magunkat, ráadásul mikor már megtaláltuk a kincseket és a kijárat felé megyünk, nagyon egysíkú a játék. Volt olyan játékos, aki egyetlen helyen tudott egy mozgást végezni és figyelte, hogy mikor kerül oda a bábu és akkor tolt egyet rajta, amikor túljutottunk azon a részen, már nem volt semmi dolga. Nekem unalmas és lapos ez a játék.

Few 2p games so far. Gonna try other player counts.

A cooperative party game is same as [thing=38453][/thing] at the core but with much more simpler rules(while less theme). Both games let each player control only a small part of the whole team and press players to figure out the solution in limited time.

I am developing a hatred for games in which you aren't allowed to communicate with the other players. It simply isn't fun and only serves to create a metagame in which you communicate through motions or noises instead, thereby rendering the restriction pointless. This isn't a fun game, either.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2018)

What a surprise! As is usual with me, I didn’t know anything about the game when I bought it, but I really REALLY liked it! I want to play it again soon!

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 6 minutes. Playtime is under 20 minutes with 8 players, that’s insane!

I´m still unclear on the theme as the friend who explained it didn’t really say. The game´s components are good. I like the art!

Magic Maze is a cooperative, real-time game in which players can’t speak to each other unless certain condition is met (I love this). So far I have played the game twice, both times with 8 players and it was very fun. We almost failed the 2nd scenario but we managed to win it. I think it is much easier with 8 players, so I will try it with 4 players next (I feel this is the best player configuration). Not only there are less people thinking, each player has more responsibilities now and no action overlaps. Gameplay is very fun, players are trying to get to some location with a particular meeple and then to find the exit, but each player can only move the meeples in certain way so you need to cooperate and all of this is against the clock (3 minutes I think). This sound much easier than it really is and all players need to be engaged all the time, there is no downtime, no alpha player.

Bottom line, Magic Maze really surprised me. It is definitively a keeper for me and I will buy all its promos and expansions soon. I can’t wait to play it again. Good cooperative game and it can be a great game for the family. I will read the rules soon and I hope the game gets harder with more scenarios.

RATING: 6
Not sure what all the hype is about.  The idea that each player has a specific power to use in contribution to the group is a mildly intriguing concept. However, here there are usually only a few obvious moves and those who see them or are controlling the group grab the tapping device and tap away.  The restriction on speaking prevents any type of real in-depth planning or strategic depth.

Another fantastic co-op against the clock. I may be a little biased because of how much I love this type of game, but Magic Maze is fantastic... At two or more players. The solo option does not give a representation of what the game is supposed to be. I like how it scales from a puzzley co-op to a ridiculous party-esqe game at 8 or 9 players. I enjoy the real time puzzle aspect as a differentiation to real time dice rolling and symbol matching.

If you hate real time you'll hate it, obviously.

Speed real time cooperation under time pressure and the limitation of not being allowed to talk or point things out to each other. The only allowed interaction is a big red pawn that can be demonstratively placed in front of other players.

To reach ist potential, it's necessary that players stick to these rules as well as that players understand their role. One player not getting the game will ruin it for all. To succeed, the group needs to develop tacit conventions on interacting. 

A fun game and close to perfection in its genre. I would join again with the right group but I prefer less stressful games and I'm not keen on the process of perfecting conventions. One of the reasons I'm not interested in playing Hanabi with players who played it to exhaustion.

Quick playing real time coop that can create some good angst and frustration at other players. Does pretty well at eliminating alpha player issue. It is better to play so that the roles circulate within the round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great addition to this recent trend of co-ops which limit communication. Best at 3-4, where no action overlaps and you have to do multiple things at once, and catch up quickly to what the others are doing, rather than just stare and move stuff half-assed-ly. Leads to some great moments when two players have different plans for one of the meeples.

"Overall, Magic Maze is super! It's definitely not for everyone (which makes it kind of apparent why the SdJ didn't work out), but that doesn't mean in any way that it's not a triumph of a game. I love the real-time component being used to add tension, and I love the elements of exploration and discovery. Normally I'm against silent games, but I think that works to its advantage here, as it forces an almost-tactile form of wordless communication between the players. It's not just about seeing what they are doing, but the game becomes about anticipating and incorporating likely moves into your strategy, and waiting to help other players where you can so you can accomplish a shared goal. It's a super-great cooperative game, and I'd highly recommend it if you think it would be a good fit for your group!"

This is a cool unique real-time cooperative games. I have discovered I tend to dislike real-time games when they are competitive. In this, each player are collectively moving pawns on a map, but only in the different directions that were dealt to them. And the restrictions in communication makes it exciting to work out what move the group is waiting you to do.

Real time coop with a twist that nobody controls a character. Enjoyed the game very much, but I simply cannot play: the color scheme does not work for colorblinds. Ok,  they use symbols, so I can play... But the symbols are too small to be spotted in a game with time preasure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game that I enjoy at 4-6 players, in this game you have to help four adventurers find their weapons and escape from a fantasy mall setting. The catch is that you can't talk and the only form of communication is a little red pawn. The limited communication makes for a bit of a learning curve but after a few tries the team really starts to work together. Very satisfying when you finally complete some of the harder scenarios.

Mildly chaotic but with definite structure beneath. Theme did not really come through in anything - probably the time pressure worked against that.  Players with multi-move tiles were more likely to stall out or get confused, but not too bad. Board difficult to read in lower light, with some colors blending in or fading out of view. One mildly color blind player had additional trouble.

Magic Maze is pure simple fun. I enjoy the silent communication. Its a real pleasure having my children spot a move that Dad has missed. The challenge is just right — its neither too hard nor too easy for us. This is a great little game!

Még nem igazán tudom, mit gondoljak erről a játékról. :D
Egyrészt nagyon poén, egyszerű, de mégis figyelős, a küldetések során az újabb lapkák bekerülésével már nehezen átlátható. Másrészt kettesben talán kicsit túl könnyű. Még a bénázásokkal is elég jól megy, gyorsan meg lehet szokni, hogy ki mire képes. 4-5 fővel biztosan izgalmasabb, mert akkor jóval erősebben kell figyelni a másikra, meg hogy mikor van szükség ténylegesen az én képességemre. Amúgy nagyon jó, egyedi az alapötlet, csak még nem volt meg a "le vagyok nyűgözve" érzés. De valószínűleg ennél a játéknál nincs is erre szükség.

Base game generates a mostly-fun kind of stress, and it's an interesting exercise in exploring the edges of communication within a group. As with most of these it feels like shorthand signals would develop within a group over time, and make it less enjoyable, but the game's wild array of bonus scenarios seem determined to fight back against that.

Probado en las RolenQuart 2017 y Jesta 2017

Es un cooperativo muy estresante en el que tienes que intentar salir de una serie de habitaciones. Cada jugador se encarga de hacer un tipo de movimiento, vas a contrarreloj y no puedes hablar, así que tienes que intentar que tus compañeros hagan el movimiento que necesitas lo más rápido posible.

Me deja una sensación amor/odio, porque no me gusta estresarme jugando, pero el juego está bien llevado, con una dificultad bastante ajustada.

[size=12][b]Why I like Magic Maze:[/b][/size]
+ I like progressing through the increasingly challenging yet simply described missions.
+ I like how the game is not a real-time puzzle game.
+ I like the mechanics of the game.
+ The game is short.
+ The game is easy to teach (especially if you start from the first mission and talk throughout the game).
+ Players are highly involved with the game.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Magic Maze:[/b][/size]
/ I find the iconography hard to see but that is easily fixed with custom game components.
/ I like the expansion as this adds modules to say swap a role between two players thus addressing moments where players get stuck. 
/ I like to add protocols for the "do something" pawn to increase the odds of winning.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is quite an interesting puzzle - I could see this working well as a teambuilding exercise. The scenarios ramp up the rules nicely. Feels easy for the most part initially but I expect it gets more challenging as one ramps up. Probably will pick it up for teambuilding purposes. Probably better with more players than less. Not so much a game as an exercise/puzzle to solve although you can score a scenario based on how many times you used the egg timer spaces which extends your time to finish the puzzle.

What a fun little package of a game. Real time coop with each player being the only one who can do certain movements for the pawns on the board, along with the added difficulty of players not being able to communicate for most of the game. The game plays in about 5 to 10 min and really is hilarious when players are trying to get the others in the group to do something. This game isn't going to break any molds but is definitely a good entry into the filler category.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Manic enjoyment for anyone who likes real-time games. Difficult to play by the rules and avoid pointing or opening your mouth during the frenzy of activity. 
The board tiles do have a tendency to slide around, so you're never really sure where the doors line up. 
Great fun, but I suspect the challenge may start to decline as players become more experienced (hence the rating). It also sheds its thin thematic veneer very quickly and there could have been more differentiation between the pieces in terms of what they can or can't do.
Would be good to have a "traitor" player who is able to mess things up.
Seems to be a bit too easy with more players. 4 looks like the sweet spot.

I don't usually like co-op games, but this one went better than I expected. Everyone has a task to perform based upon the action tile in front of them, and we both had to keep an eye on the routes and objectives. There wasn't one person telling everyone what to do, which is what I abhor about co-ops most of the time. The game also plays quickly, so that's another plus. It's nice that there are increasingly difficult scenarios to keep the game challenging, and to modulate difficulty depending upon the people playing, such as adding in kids or more AP-type folks. Played well with 2 people. Looking forward to seeing the chaos that will inevitably ensue with 4 players, as long as they are my close friends, so I can make fun of them. (I, of course, expect the same treatment in return.)

Wow, echt cooles Spiel. Hatte bei Magic Maze an ein anderes Spiel gedacht und war doch sehr, sehr überrascht wie gut das Spiel ist.
Jeder Spieler erhält einen Chip, auf dem eine Himmelsrichtung angegeben ist (auf jedem ein Anderer, klar!).
Ziel des Spiels ist es 4 farbige Figuren zu ihren entsprechend farbigen Zielfeldern zu bewegen und danach alle zu ihren entsprechend farbigen Ausgängen. Dabei darf jeder Spieler jede Spielfigur bewegen, allerdings nur in die seinem Plättchen entsprechender Richtung UND es darf nicht geredet werden... UND es geht auf Zeit! Die Sanduhr läuft unerbitlich...
Ein Escape etwas anderer Art.
Hat mir sehr gut gefallen.

Completed the tutorial with SO.

It's possible that it can even reach the 8+ after a couple of more games (and 4p games).

I've needed some plays to enjoy this game. First, it was very chaotic; now it flows better and better.  You are under a lot of stress during a play, and even a little bit mad about the other players. But in the end, it gives me a very fulfilled feeling. I can only play this game when I'm in the mood :) but it's a good game!

I tried this out for the first time at GenCon and pretty much immediately got hooked. Magic Maze fixes the alpha gamer problem because you can't freaking talk and everyone needs to help play the game. I also love communication restrictions and time pressure, so this is pretty much the ideal co-op for me.

I will say that it's not great at 5+ players, just because when there are redundancies, one of them frequently ends up barely helping.

Magic Maze is a cooperative game played silently where players have to move characters through a maze to get to specific targets and where each player can only perform specific actions. When waiting for a player to do something, others can either look at him or put a large pawn in front of him. It plays quickly and is decent enough for families but will likely have a very short play life.

Wonderful and quick game at all player counts. The red piece makes up for any frustration you feel if other players are slowpokes.

It's a coop, it has a sandtimer. Two things I hate in games, so take that into account when you check my rating. The game even got a bonuspoint for originality. First you build up the maze by moving the pawns to the outside, so new tiles are added. Each player can only move in a certain direction. Secondly, each colored pawn needs to pick up a certain tool, thirdly you all try to escape. Original but totally not my taste.

Great co-op game with the same frenetic feeling as Escape: the curse of the temple but now your not rolling dice and speaking is not allowed in general. Great game and my oldest son really likes it as well. Highly recommended! Deserved the SdJ nomination!

Co-op game where each player has one or two action that they can do, for example, I can be the player that can move the Heroes to the Left and Explore... so I always have to be aware of all the heroes to see when I have to move them or Explore... other player will be able to move them up or down, to the right... to Portals, up and down escalators...

Players are all cooperating but they can't talk... they can only use one wooden figure to put in front of the player that they want to perform an action to alert them they are meant to do something!!

It's real time, it can be stressful but it's LOTS of fun!!!

It's a good game. I think its unique and very cool. It's not great for me though. I like to talk (and scream) during timed games so this is very difficult for me. I would play it again every once and a while but not too often. Very cool for people who like co-op a lot and want to try something new.

Magic Maze - you each have an action card (e.g. move South) and cooperatively you have to move coloured pawns around a maze to collect coloured items and then escape. The twist is that you cannot speak during the game and when you see that someone needs to perform an action you grab a large red marker and thump it down on the table in front of them. They look at you with no understanding at all, so you thump it down even harder!!!! Tremendous party fun!

As I was first introduced to this game I felt a rush of true excitement. Immediately wanted to buy it, and player it many times over. 

That was a mistake I think, which left me a little unwanting to play it now. Still, a very good idea, packaged well. I like it!

This is the game that unseated Escape: The Curse of the Temple for me and my gaming group. I have just as much fun with both games, but Magic Maze is more intuitive, easier to set-up and take down, is more flexible between player counts, allows for more players, and it doesn't get bogged down by bad luck. Magic Maze is also a funnier game - the clacking of the "do-something pawn" or knocking on the table which escalates as the sand runs out of the timer always cracks people up. As of writing this comment, I've played it 10 times and I could easily see playing it a hundred times and loving it the same every time.

In this cooperative filler, you play a character with a special function. The goal is to get out of the dungeon. You are racing against a three minute timer. The trick is that you may not speak or gesture. The only thing you can do is put a pawn in front of someone to request them to do something. Each character moves one direction only, so you have to coordinate movements within the group. Each character has a special function, such as teleporting, using stairs, or drawing a new map tile to explore. You first have to get all the character tokens to a matching spot on the map, then you can proceed to exit. There are also first aid stations where you can flip the timer, then you can talk before taking a turn. On level 1, the exit is only one location for all the characters. On level 2 difficulty, each character has their own exit location. 

It's fun, and can be frustrating at the same time. What you think is the right move, might not be what someone else is thinking, so that can be fun as well.  Really, it is a 4 player game, as it is hard to see how extra players with duplicate movement in one direction would help the game. Looking forward to trying the higher levels.

Surprise favorite of GenCon 50 and strong favorite for Game of the Year 2017.  So much stressful fun.

A common complaint is the issues with a large player count in the early scenarios -- two people butting heads as they try to manipulate the same pieces.  That problem lessens when the full game is in swing.  And it's WORTH getting to full game quickly.  (Also, try splitting responsibilities at the hourglass flip, jabroni.)

RATING: 5
Collaborative realtime escape from a maze that is created by putting tiles while playing. Players are not allowed to talk or even point, only communication allowed is via putting a special marker in front of another player to get their attention. I generally don't like games that forbid interacting with each other, especially if they are cooperative, but it could work as a first icebreaker with people you don't know, when you have nothing to talk about yet.

We played this at a local boardgames cafe and it was a blast. You and your friends cooperatively take on a heist. You each take on specific abilities that can move any pawn, but only in a certain direction. You may be able to move right, but other players will move up, down, or left so you have to work together to get the pawn to where they need to go. The goal is to get all the pawns onto their coloured area and then escape via the pawn's specific exit. Any player can make their move on any pawn at any time so there can be periods where everyone is reaching into the game board and other times where no one can agree on what to do next. The twist is that you cannot talk while trying to move the pawns and you have a timer that will limit how many moves the team can make. 

The mechanics are easy enough to understand, but the changing of roles and the inability to talk to one another can lead to some tense moments of trying to convince someone that a portal might be in their best interest! There can be some tense moments as people stare in befuddlement while everyone else is hammering on the table for them to use the portal or the escalator or that player hasn't realized their role has changed due to a flip of the timer and the timer marches on and on and on... So you may only get two or three rounds of this game before a frustration level sets in that requires everyone to take a breather.

RATING: 7
This real-time co-op has each player responsible for their own subset of actions, where each player is dependent on each other player seeing what needs to be done (quickly) and executing quickly. It works well if everyone can get into the zone and collectively concentrate and perform at similar levels - I wouldn't want to play it with different aged kids for instance. You really need to go through the scenarios as a team, working out pseudo-protocols for the priorities in regards to the order in which to move the meeples, and how to manage the time bonuses. The better you get, the less the urge to communicate (ie cheat), and the more satisfaction gleaned from a job done well. The further you move through the scenarios, the more rules, options, and obstacles the game throws at you to ensure you’re never quite comfortable. I'm looking forward to continuing on and seeing how good we get at the more difficult levels, but I'm not sure how much replay there'll be after that - the necessary skill will have been acquired and there won't be much left to prove.

Magic Maze is a real-time cooperative game in which the players are trying to move four pawns to claim the appropriately-colored pieces of equipment, and then leave via the appropriate exits. The pawns all start on a central tile, and all of the other tiles, which possibly contain the equipment or exits, don't come out until they are explored. Each player is given a tile showing a direction or action (such as explore), that player can move any of the pawns only in that direction. Players cannot talk at all during this game, but there is a large totem that you can place in front of a player if you want them to act. The players lose when a sand timer expires, but there are spots on the board that can reset the timer. As someone who likes neither real-time games nor cooperative games, this one really doesn't appeal to me. I find the communications embargos tend to increase awkwardness too. I can see why a lot of people like, though.

Fun real-time cooperative game without talking.  It had a Gauntlet feel without the monsters.  It was fun and challenging to race the clock and use the actions.  I can see how it can open up for many types of games and players.  

Game had an issue when multiple people had the same movement action, so sometimes people were left out of play while their counterpart made the moves.  I question how decent this can be played outside of four players.

This game plays great with 2 and 4 players. The pacing of the game makes it flow so good and the quickness of everyone being able to perform a movement at any point in the game feels like there’s no lulls but if there is just use the red piece to alert someone there’s an action they need to do. This game is always a great time.

Co-operative time management maze puzzle for 1-8 players, in which you have to find the shortest routes for four coloured pawns to their coloured squares, then to their coloured exits: to win do it within the allotted sand time of 15 mins or less.

This co-op may well have reduce the need for Escape the Temple and Burgle Bros, with  the archaic sand-timer replacing the soundtrack and a heist themed game with a shorter playing time. Innovative way of getting everyone involved, again addresses the alpha attitude by the time and communication restrictions (but the reason I like co-ops is to encourage discussion, with pointing out alpha attitude if need be). The play itself I wonder feels like being in an orchestra/dance in which when everyone plays fluidly there a wonderful flow of achievement for everyone, the great thing about co-ops: there is no status that some kids (and adults) struggle with. Yet I can't help feeling an opportunity was missed: sure the fantasy tropes are popular and fun here in an anachronistic setting (the shopping mall), but I think a time travel theme of retrieving artifacts would have been a lot better, especially with tiles with different eras depicting imagery which would have generated interest in kids.

Co-op, real time. Think Escape: Cursed Temple but instead of dice you have to silently observe and position the pieces as each player only controls a specific movement/action ability. However this one is as quiet as Escape is noisy. Can be a bit stressful/frantic as you puzzle out. Variable difficulty, scenarios.
Probably best with 4 (+/-1), a better fit than Captain Sonar for smaller groups.

This game is pure fun! It can be stressful and frustrating but in a good way. Sometimes you want to yell at another player so bad to just move the yellow pawn, not the orange pawn.

This makes it really easy to involve new players when needed and work your way up to an even knowledge level. Great game for all ages and can't wait for the first expansion.

I watched Rahdo video, from which I also kinda learned rules.

I am not fan of fast, stressful, timer games, but this has something in it, which makes it so good and easy to play.
Rules are simple, clear and easy to teach. On other hand rulebook could made easier to understand visually how many and which tiles (movement) we need for different numbers of players. Those small numbers on bottom are kinda ..ehhh...and it took few minutes to understand which tiles we needed, as I didn't want to read rulebook. 
We did first scenario, lost 5 times out of 6, but absolutely had great time!

There's already little enough bite to appeal to me in a cooperative games, but in Magic Maze moreso than others, you're relegated to a quasi-solitary experience. It baffles me how this is so well-received.

tentative rating based on a PnP play of the intro scenario.  I liked it -- there was neat back-and-forth between players and I liked the limited communication rules.  The first scenario was too easy and probably has low replay value, but I am optimistic about the additional content the full game has solving that.  Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed my first play.

update:  With my kids, I'v played it untimed (but with communication restrictions, so you have to tag a timer symbol to talk). It's good that way; you can't lose, but there is a lot of fun in trying to coordinate and learn about inferring people's intentions and not getting too focused on one pawn.

the box. ugg. i ignored this game for so long just due to the box. even let's-plays didn't seem interesting. thankfully someone from my gaming group bought and we got to see just how **fantastically engaging** this game can be! fun paths, minor pattern recognition, tricky role switching, novel story and control, low alpha-gamer involvement, and a scaling level of challenge that seems to fit any group from beginner to hardened tactical shopper. completing the Dual Planes of Existence challenge with four people felt like quite the pinnacle of accomplishments!! ...but, i'm not sure what else there is left for me here. two player with the wife isn't all that much of a challenge. i don't dare try teaching a five year old. also, i'm hesitant to introduce this to my family over the holidays because it's going to be pretty painful watching the timer run out over and over. price-wise this was a fairly sweet deal. and, hey, if the family likes it then they can borrow it! otherwise, i'm really up in the air whether to put it in the purge pile or the "i don't mind my son losing these pieces" pile.

Holy cow what a fun game. Exciting, real-time action with your friends. Funny thematic concept and easy to learn gameplay. Everyone was snickering with delight and couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of it all when my group played. The Red Pawn turns out to be a hilarious communicator and hitting a Sand Timer so you can FINALLY talk and tell your buddy how dumb they've been for the past 3 minutes is great!

The game has tons of scenarios to progress through so plenty of content for your group.

It's accessible, quick, fun, encourages teamwork, planning, and is generally just an exciting experience. Hits all my requirements for a game and I would highly recommend to most any group!

Edit: This game has been brought down from a 9 to a 7 after the honeymoon phase. While I still enjoy the game and am down to play it, sometimes its just not the right mood. The game can be very tense and for some players this is just stressful and unfun. This game can be a dividing factor for people depending on their personalities. If you do not perform well under stress or find enjoyment in the thrill of high pressure scenarios, do not purchase the game. The same goes for if your friend/gaming group feels this way.

This is a really cool real-time cooperative game.

Innovative idea where the players (normally) must not talk during a scenario. This is a chaotic but funny game. But I can imagine that you reach the spot where the players perfectly run through the levels. Until then the degree of difficulty increases and you are learning by playing.

I really find this game intriguing but about half the people who try it are turned off.  First it takes a few plays before you'll recognize the maze features that you need to find.  Second, there is time pressure and some people hate that.  Third there is social pressure from the red token and some people hate THAT.

After teaching this three different settings, I can report the best reception when playing the first few games totally without the timer; first with talking; then no talking; then using a longer timer than the three minute timer provided.  I'll be damned if some fast-thinking whippersnappers who can hang with a 3 minute timer will keep me from enjoying this game!

All that said, I hope I can find three other people who really want to play this with me.

I thought I was going to hate this, given real-time games rarely work for me.  But the puzzle nature appeals to me, I appreciated the cleverness of the escalating scenarios and the joy of the pawn adds a lot.  Plus it largely solves the alpha-player issue of co-ops (well, up to a point, anyway.)

As I mentioned in my comments for Dungeon Time, our group really enjoys playing cooperative games and love them, but somehow we never seem to do that well with them.  We have yet to win at Samurai Spirit and we couldn’t get past the first level of Dungeon Time until the fourth play through of it.  Even so, we still have a lot of fun and always seek out new cooperative games to try.  Magic Maze has been a really fun and fascinating new cooperative experience.  The theme is whimsical and the goals of first finding the treasures and then the exits are pretty simple.  However, splitting the available actions between the players combined with the “NO TALKING or communicating other than using the big red pawn and staring” rule is such an innovative and clever design.  Then add in the time limitations and playing the game becomes an overwhelming mix of excitement and frustration.  It requires true teamwork to be successful, but it definitely isn’t easy.  Like a mobile app, introducing the rules and expanding the goals one level at a time is ingenious and really makes this game approachable and addictive.  I think we’re only at level 4 of 5 after about 8 plays, but I can’t get enough of it and want to play the game more!  Magic Maze is another really fun and exciting cooperative game that will continue to challenge and taunt us for a long time to come.

Real time cooperative chaos! Work together without talking. Super fun game, very easy to teach and you must be super focused as a team. Any weak links with bring the team down and everyone must perform to complete the goal! Stressful but in a good way. Definitely not a game for everyone. For some, it produces unwanted stress and for some it provides a great sense of achievement. Super hit or miss.

RATING: 7
I've only played with 6 players and it was a blast, we played through the first 5 levels on one session. Thanks to the campaign based introduction the game it's really simple to learn, after the first level everyone already knew all the rules.

The timer and the communication limitation are the keys for this game success. There is lot of tension and when the time starts to run out it can become quite stressful for some people, so keep that in mind.

My main concern is that the game might become repetitive after playing all the missions. So far each level added something new to keep it fresh, but I'm not sure if this will be enough going forward.

Overall, I think this is an excellent choice to play with non-gamers and family, but it's entertaining enough so hardcore gamers can enjoy it and have a nice time.

This game is a blast!  I always have one or more Christmas Eve presents wrapped so they are opened and played throughout the day on Christmas Eve.  This was the finale and was a huge hit! My two adult sons, my middle sons fiance, my 14 year old and my 86 year old mother played this and it was so fun!!!  There was a lot of cheating with pointing, clearing throats and all out screaming "DO THIS!!!" but who cares!  We were laughing so hard!  We ended up with 12 board games this Christmas and it was requested again on Christmas day that we play this one.  Can't wait to get further into the campaigns!

Teljesen ugyanaz az élmény, mint az Escape. Ott őrült kockadobálásról szól a játék, itt meg az őrült lépkedésekről, kapkodásról. Az alapötlet jó, a játékosok közösen próbálják egy plázában a feladatot megoldani a 4 karakterrel. Mindenki csak 1 vagy  2 irányba tudja mozgatni bármelyik figurát, így figyelni kell egymásra és időben megoldani a feladatot. Az ilyen játékok számomra nem jönnek be, így kell értékelni a pontját. Egy fokkal jobban tetszett, mint az Escape.

This is a real time cooperative game much in the same vein as something like Escape!  There are 4 colored pawns on a tiled map and each player is only able to take certain actions on the pawns such as moving them in specific directions, using portals, exploring new tiles, etc.  No talking is allowed so you have to figure out how to divide tasks in the game with very minimal communication.  All you are allowed to do is put a token in front of a player indicating you want them to take an action but no other information.

I really liked it.  I haven't won yet and we've only done the first, easiest/simplest scenario, it is pretty tough.  But the nice thing is there are several other scenarios with new and more interesting complex features and rules.

It is maybe just a wee bit more simple than I would prefer and considering I'm a bit boisterous and likes board games in part due to the communication and socialism, having to stay quiet isn't my favorite thing.  But as a package it is a well designed and fun engaging game.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun little cooperative real time game. Together you travel into a mall to collect your goods and exit. The interesting part is that each player is assigned a direction, north, south, east, and west. Each player can move any of the pawns on the board, but only in the direction they were assigned. In addition, you are not allowed to talk to the other players. Definitely an interesting coop, I do not typically like real time games, but I can appreciate it for what it is.

RATING: 6.5
Clever real-time game where players are forced to cooperate by virtue of the fact that all players share the character pawns and each has only partial control: player A can move any pawn North, player B can move any pawn West or use escalators, etc. Of course, you are not allowed to communicate.

Staged scenarios introduce the rules one by one; the "full game" includes more tiles and special abilities for each pawn; two of those abilities are only required to counteract new hazards so the net effect is still an increase in difficulty. It's quite hard enough already, particularly with more players where signalling is harder, so I'm not sure the complexity is worth the effort unless you're consistently winning earlier scenarios.

In theory it scales from 1-8, but the ability distribution doesn't work so well with more than 5. The 1-player variant is just speed with a smidgen of puzzle and it's hard to recommend.

[Pegasus Spiele 17 Edition] {Mall; real-time, co-operation; optimal 4-6} Magic Maze is a fun real-time co-op games for families or parties.  I like it.  Each player have an own action, and can only act upon it.  Players have work together to let the heroes steal things and then escape altogether before the sand timer runs out.  I believe replay value is good.

Communication is more restricted in this game.  That's good.

It takes a little while to teach this game, but the introductory scenario 1 helps a lot.

The production is fine.  I wish they would provide more customised meeples.  And I want larger tiles too.

This game is nothing for the relaxed sit back gaming evening! One can only enjoy it if he wants to take part in the wild action and frantic search for which meeple to move when the other players are devouring you with their eyes. After more plays with the same people a team can form though which understands each other blindly. This feeling of a great team working together I experienced similarily only in one other game: Hanabi.
Though the game will surely provide >10 hours of new gameplay experience with the different scenarios, they are not that plenty as they seem to be. Only 7 of them really introduce new rules, the rest are not-so-great variations of the existing ones.
Also as with other fast paced games I could not play this game for a whole evening  as it demands concentration.
Still recommended as it provides a unique gaming experience.

tl;dr: a fun challenge

This is a cooperative game, and it is of the lighter fare. I appreciate both these aspects in games, but neither are my favorite.
This game gives players a maze to explore and each new level adds a new element or rule to make it harder. Each player has their own special ability, but at a certain point those start shifting during the game, screwing with your mind quite a bit. An other big aspect is that you can't talk for most of it, and getting across a message to an other player can be tricky.
I quite enjoyed playing this, but I don't feel the need to explore this more. If someone would request to play this, I wouldn't object though.

This can be a fun game; this can be a frustrating game. When you are humming along it is a thing of beauty. However, it is hard not to get on each other's nerves when the next course of action isn't agreed upon between players. I think 4 is best; and having the roughly the same team  is better as well, you just don't always know how others play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Magic Maze is a realtime coop where the players collectively move 4 pawns around map trying to get them in specific locations.  This would be trivially easy if not for two twists.  First, each player gets assigned a cardinal direction and that player can only move pawns in the assigned direction.  Second, the players cannot talk.  All they can do is put a red pawn in front of someone that indicates to the person that they need to do something.

I love coops, especially if they avoid quarterbacking, so this is right up my alley.  It's a bit like Hanabi because of the lack of communication, but it felt more like Ricochet Robots where you are constantly scanning the board and trying to solve a puzzle.

I could see some people not liking this at all.  Realtime can be stressful in general, but Magic Maze feels even more stressful.  There are times when everyone will be staring at you because you need to do something important, but they can't tell you what you need to do.  Some people would find that too stressful, but I enjoy it.  I'm looking forward to exploring the numerous variations in gameplay that come in the box.

RATING: 8
Played the two-player game to learn the rules. While the game is certainly not good with two players, seems like it should be fun for 4-6.

I will point out that the "scenario" system is a little misleading. Scenarios 1-7 just add a new rule each time until you build up to the full game, then the remaining "scenarios" are just different variants that you can use. Simple little variants such as no communication at all, put the tile stack face-up, etc.

Despite that, it seems like the game should see plenty of plays for its simplicity and uniqueness. If they continue to develop this system, I could even see it replacing Escape as my go-to real-time cooperative game. There are some similarities (mainly the way exploration works and that they're both timed co-ops) but Magic Maze has a smaller footprint, doesn't have dice bouncing all over the place, and doesn't need explanation for all of the various modules that Escape has (not until Magic Maze gets some expansions, anyway).

Though I usually ignore theme, I also have to commend them on the fun theme. You're a group of generic fantasy characters... who are robbing a shopping mall!

Looking forward to more plays.

Update: Played a few times with four players and it is a lot of fun. I will say that once you have a lot of tiles on the board it can be hard to spot the all of the exits because they don't stand out from the other art very much. I'm not sure if that is intentional to make the game harder or not.

So far this seems like it will be a keeper. It's very easy to set it up and play two or three times in a row before moving on to something else. Also eager to see how it plays out with 5-6 players.

However, when that isn't the case this is a real delight great fun and one I really enjoy introducing people to. I'm still to play some of the levels beyond 3.

That hateful big red pawn!
Let's all get annoyed with each other trying to move bullshit fantasy adventurers around a shopping mall (ffs!) to solve a totally arbitrary timed puzzle?
On second thoughts we could try playing something that's actually fun and won't cause any falling out...

Absolutely one of my favorite games! I love the crazy chaotic time that unravels thought out this game.  working together with a time limit is pretty hard, and now adding the fact that you CAN'T TALK!!! It just turns into utter chaos. One of the greatest moments is when you reach the sand timer space you talk about whats the plan, and then the movement begins and someone ALWAYS forgets the plan IMMEDIATELY!! SO much fun great times!

after a few games with my son, my father, a random german family, I must say this is really fun and most of all, it's a great original idea. the fact that you are nota  character but an action is pure genius. if it lasts for enough time i'll raise the rating to 8

Real time co-op tile placing fantasy scavenger hunt without dice.  Players each have limited direction cards and must work together in silence to navigate a group of hard luck and penniless fantasy heroes through a local shopping mall to find, pilfer, and exit with their weapons before time runs out.  I like the opportunity to reset the sand timers on some tiles to buy more time.  I totally appreciate this approach to create a real time co-op strategy game without the cacophonic mayhem of crashing dice.

Zany. I've never wanted to progress through scenarios more, though I've yet to find a group to do that with. Gets a 9 for being insanely frustrating to play with people who can't focus or multitask.

Real-time maze navigation puzzle where each player is limited to only performing certain actions (e.g. move pawn left). Additional twist; game has to be played in silence (except for in the case of specific events), which means everyone is in a state of silent frustration.  As you get used to the base rules, add in extra scenarios for new challenges and obstacles. Is fun.

As far as real time co-op games go, Magic Maze is one of the best. Of course, it is lighter then something like Captain Sonar or Space Alert, but it is much more interesting than Escape: The Curse of the Temple. I love that there are scenarios that add various different tiles or different rules. My wife and I are currently making our way through them right now. Also this game was added to my Hardcore 10x10 challenge so it will see the table a lot in 2018.

I have been enjoying this one so far. I feel you have to enjoy real time frantic games but it is fun. It feels really clumsy at first but if you persist it gets easier and more satisfying. Not sure how much legs it has overall but fun for now.

Definitely got my heart racing and people are slamming the red marker down in front of me repeatedly and I'm staring at the board trying to figure out where the heck I'm supposed to make a move.  I wonder the statistics on how many people have gotten punched in the face playing this game.  Will avoid this only slightly less than the plague.

Quiet chaos. One of the best co-ops I've played. Very inventive and will get you laughing at everyone's ignorance.

RATING: 7.5
Extremely frantic and hilarious experience. Although it's a co-op game, unlike most titles in the genre, Magic Maze doesn't feel like a boring activity which you keep getting orders from "leader" every minutes in game session. MM has a genuine sense of cooperation and combined effort.

Magic Maze is a fun, real-time cooperative game. It felt a bit odd that we planned out our moves beforehand, and at each turn of the sand-timer, but I guess it's a necessity (for competitive players at least). It is a lot of fun, but the management of several roles is a bit much perhaps, and at certain player numbers, you may be the only player that only has one move to perform (which isn't much fun). I'd love to explore this further, and to see what the expansion adds.

This is an interesting take on the real-time cooperative game genre. I've tried most player counts and scenarios at the point, and I think 4 is a sweet spot.

RATING: 8
Fun "party" style game.  Very tense, but makes you feel like a fool if you can't spot something you are supposed to be doing.  Difficult to not cheat somehow when someone is not understanding when you are trying to remind them to do an action somewhere.  Still a nicely made and fun game.

I wasn't in the right mood to play this when I got to play... so I might like it more with the next play.  However I usually like real time games on principle so I'm not sure. The idea of sharing moves for each piece with other people without verbal communication seems really neat, but in practice it seemed to make people more frustrated than the fun they were having. It was pretty neat when we were all on the same page moving things quickly though.  My biggest problem was that the board was pretty busy and I had a lot of trouble both missing walls and being able to easily see what the goal destination of each piece was.  So... I am interested in playing again to see if its more fun when I know what I'm in for... but I'm not sure how high a hopes I have.

[b]1st session, 3p, a handful of plays up to scenario 3:[/b]

I was actually more interested in this game than the 2017 SdJ winner. Works well with 3p, although being the sole owner of multiple specific actions probably adds more pressure than when playing with 4p+. I think it's a bit too chaotic to warrant playing for long periods of time. Scenario difficulty ramps up/scales well, even if it really only means adding more permanent rules and more tiles.

Initial rating: [b]7.25[/b]

[b]A few more sessions, additional plays, ranging from 3p to 5p[/b]:

4p or 5p is a game-changer and my preferred way to play. It still continues to be just as chaotic as before but still fun. I hate to say it but it might not have gone up in rating, then again I haven't seen it past scenario 3 (I've been playing with a new group in each of these plays so progress has been slow). I'll make sure to persevere.

Verdict: [b]7.25[/b]

Ich tat mir bisher immer schwer mit hektischen Echtzeitspielen, weil mich der Zeitdruck mehr stresst als dass er mir Spaß macht. Bei Magic Maze ist das aber etwas anderes, das macht tatsächlich Laune!

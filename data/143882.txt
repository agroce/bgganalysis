RATING: 6
1st play: Normally I'm not a fan of trick taking games.  I always feel like most of the decisions are out of my hands based upon what cards I happen to draw.  The fact that I lose so often at them means I must be wrong about that.  This one tho is really good.  Which suit is trump suit vs not trump, the Ebbes scoring, all of that is really good.  I still lost but I enjoyed the game.

2nd play: The second play went a bit longer, going the full 5 rounds.  Trick taking games always feel so random to me, and I feel like they're full of non-decisions, with the occasional interesting choice that's only partially informed anyway.  Most Trick taking games don't really have any redeeming qualities for me, but this one does.  Deciding when to play your power card and trying to draw the power cards out from other players' hands is fun.

Good solid ideas for a tick taking game. Will use the more cards variant in the future as the hand size was a bit too small. Two full rounds per color didn't give enough tactical leverage nor enough opportunities to kick others when they are up or down.

I love card games, always have! This is a really neat spin on the game which seems to keep anyone from getting too far ahead. With players dictating so many rules as the game goes along, it is easy to gang up on another player, but even then, hard to hand one player all the cards.

I have found the best strategy on this game is to take as few of tricks as possible. This seems to lead to the best results! The game is fairly quick and I find everyone that plays shows a variety of emotions as the game progresses. Overall, this has to be one of my current favorite card games, despite the less than stellar components!

 Overall Ratings

Instructions: 10/10 Clear and concise.

Ease of Play: 8/10 This game takes some getting used to. You have to all pay attention to not only one color is being played but what number. The numbers can be a bit challenging to read if your vision is less than stellar. 

Components: 2/10 The board is flimsy and only in German. Yes, you can figure it out but it's a bit inconvenient. The board is permanently bent to fit in the box, which can make the tiny scoring markers hard to keep in place, especially if more than one person has the same score. The cards are flimsy and some of the numbers are hard to read.

Replay Value: 8/10 There is enough variety in the play of this game to keep it coming to the table.

Ebbes crosses my threshold of acceptable randomness in a game. Cards are random, fine. Winning a trick depends on card distribution among other players, fine. Playing your hand in the right order might work out or not, fine. Not knowing if you want to win a trick? Sometimes randomly being in a position to influence trump or if a certain colour is worth plus or minus points? And then randomly benefitting or not? No, thank you.

I very much enjoy trick-taking games but it's so hard to get them on the table that it's not worth it to spend time with an at best average, potentially frustrating representative of the genre.

RATING: 6
Interesting trick taking game that lives on its fresh basic idea that you don't know the real worth of your cards when the round begins. The gameplay leaves me with the feeling that this is an unpolished gem and the potential of the system hasn't quite been maximized. The box contains a load of unneeded cards and generally the game should be played with lower amounts of cards instead of the optional quantities suggested in the rules. On an additional positive note the dynamic of the game also changes neatly between different player amounts.

Cheeky game which keeps excitement as game course can change surprisingly all the time.

The idea of this game is nicely developed and suitable for experienced card players as well as for beginners who are interested in local particularities.

Due to numerous variations it keeps challenging even when the group of other players changes. 
Despite I am critical with card games we all enjoyed playing.

Sold as I don't think there is enough potential control or even time to even out the randomness over the course of the game.  Still fun though!

I enjoy trick taking games with twists and this one has a few.  One starts taking tricks without really knowing in most cases what will score positive or negative points.  When a certain declared number is played in each color determines whether it is trump, scores positive or negative points, scores if you don't have the most/least of a certain color, and who goes first next round.  However, only when those certain number cards are played is this information discovered so one often plays several tricks before this is discovered.  Control is questionable, but there are some decisions to be made.

RATING: 5
Ein sehr schönes Stichspiel.
Von 5 Farben gibt es jeweils die Kartenwerte 1-9 (Im 3er Spiel, mit mehr Mitspielern entsprechend höherwertige, zusätzliche Karten).
Alle Karten werden gleichmässig unter den Spielern aufgeteilt.
Anfangs ist eine Zahlenkarte aufgedeckt. Sobald diese Zahl in einer der 5 Farben gespielt wird, wird mit einer entsprechenden Farbkarte markiert, was für diese Runde der Trumpf ist. Sobald die zweite Zahl auftaucht ergibt diese die Farbkarten, die diese Runde Pluspunkte bringen, danach die Karte die "Ebbes" bringt (+3 Punkte für alle mit weder den wenigsten, noch den meissten Karten der Farbe) und dann diejenige Farbe die am Ende Minuspunkte zählt. Die letzte Farbe bringt "nix".
Am Ende einer Runde zählen die Spieler alle + und - Punkte und Markieren entsprächend ihren aktuellen SP Wert. Das ganze geht über 5 Runden.
Mir hat es wirklich gut gefallen, man kommt auch immer weiter in das Spiel rein. Anfangs wusste ich nicht so recht was ich ausspielen soll, mit jeder Runde wurde das aber besser. Mir gefällt Wizard aber deutlich besser, auch wenn es stark anders funktioniert, habe ich doch beschlossen mich von "Ebbes" zu trennen.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting take on a trick-taking game. Borrows ideas from a number of other games but puts them altogether nicely. Basically, you don't know until specific numbered cards are put down during play whether or not a suit will be: a) trump b) point c) negative point and d) ebbes (points for not having the least or most) or e) nothing. 

Play hands until a specific number of points have been earned. These are tallied on the game board.

I liked the intrigue. You don't want to be caught holding powerful cards that end up being the negative point suit. You also really need to know how to play your trumps correctly.

This doesn't look like much, but ebbes is a fantastic trick-taking game. It reminds me vaguely of another favorite trick-taking game of mine, Victory & Honor, though the rules here are much easier to digest.

The wrinkle here is that a certain number is chosen every round, and when someone plays a card of that number, the color associated with that card gets assigned to a type, whether it be the trump suit, the point scoring suit, the suit that subtracts points, etc. I like that this happens during the hand, unlike in Nyet, when this is all figured out before you start playing.

The game is really begging for a better presentation, especially since so much of the game's board is in German, but I think that this is one of the better trick-taking games out there. It's very simple, but I like what it brings to the table.

First impression (4 players) : Box too big. Basic tricktaking game with twist that trump/plus/minus/... point giving color (out of 5) are chosen during game. Played 5 rounds. Ok game.

RATING: 6
An original trick-taking game where the point values of suits are not known in the beginning of a round.

Can be played with a Sticheln deck. The board is just a score track, and makes the box needlessly large.

RATING: 6.5
Following standard trick taking rules where the highest card that followed the first cards suit wins the set, you must follow suit if you have the card and trump always wins. Each player selects a color and card with only one player able to select each one and when the specific card is played, that color now gets a special ability. The first one that comes out becomes trump, the second one is worth points while the fourth one is worth negative points. Although hard to control at times strategies will become more evident as you play.

Found this game when looking at games during a math trade. Popped up and looked interesting. Trick taking with an interesting mechanic for determining the various roles of each suit in a given round. Definitely a cool twist on the genre, not sure the actual game play was there. Felt I didn't have much control when I was playing cards. One less suit would have been more ideal. Probably not designed for 3 players so playing with more players would probably help as well.

RATING: 6
I liked the twist, which is that the first of a specified number to be played to each hand will determine trump suit, the second will determine which suit is worth positive points, and so on. But with the basic rules we played I didn't feel like I had a lot of control, particularly when I wasn't dealt any of the 'magic number'.

Feb 2017: Gifted to a friend. Downgrade from 8 to 5. Too tactical and chaotic.

March 2016: Avoid the basic game! Go straight to the advanced variants that (a) add more cards to the deck and (b) allow players to choose the "fuck you" cards. The latter variant adds a huge layer of strategy and control to the game!

Tried the version with the two variants with three players only. BTW, I think it would take *forever* to get the winning condition of 19 points.

Clever little trick-taking game. Its twist is that the role of each suit (ranging from trump to positive to negative points) is determined throughout the course of the round, so a tug-of-war for the control of the suit roles ensues, making adaptability a must. Sometimes one can feel they're powerless to affect anything, but this is probably par for the course for a card game.

Really a nice twist on how to score a game - it's a mix of hearts and spades, but with the game evolving as you play it, which makes for some fun surprises. It does seem a bit random with just the basic game, and having the designated number card can give you a lot of power, so I'd like to try this with one of the advanced variants to see how it enables greater control over the various suits.

RATING: 5
This is a trick taking game. There are five suits where each suit will be attached to one of the five categories: 1. Trump suit, 2. this suit scores +1, 3. +3 if you don't have most or least, 4. this suit score -1, 5. Most determine who decides 1st player in next round. Each round a number will be selected like '2' and the first number '2' played will be assigned the trump suit. Repeat for the other 4 categories. While this is interesting and adds to the strategy, it also greatly increases the randomness of the game as you won't know how good/bad your cards are until the end.

It is a variegated, exciting and exhilarant card game.
This card game never gets boring because you never know how game could change and you get supprised every time you play this game.

Can be chaotic, because you're not sure what suits do what when beginning a hand. Trump, points, negative trump, and etc. are determined as players play. But it is quite a new experience for fans of trick-taking games. More than a mere tweak on the genre like most commercial trick-takers.

You Suck was a trick-taking game that frustrated me a lot because there was a lot of uncertainty to it.  ebbes has some uncertainty, as well, but at least in this game there's only one trick to play to, which still leaves the bulk of the game under your control.  There seem to be some issues with players needing to have at least one card of the number in question, lest they wind up having no control over the tricks at all, but the ways that the suits are broken down into one of the five characteristics might balance that out.  At least with ebbes (as opposed to You Suck), there's enough game here to at least make me want to play again to see if my suspicions are correct.

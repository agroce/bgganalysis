RATING: 8
Mon top du moment (08/2017).
On a jouer un 5, on c'est vraiment bien marré. L'ambiance est top et la boite de jeux est bien garnie, on en a pour notre argent.

Par contre notre partie test d'un scénario à durée 8h (avec au moins 1h pour mise en place d'un scénario et explication de règles). On est en train de se caler un WE entier pour faire 4 scénarios de suite.
Beaucoup de règles a assimiler (37 pages), mais le tout est bien construit. On vous conseils tout de même les rappels dispo dans les fichiers de BGG.
Et contrairement à un Zombicide (même si on l'adore aussi :) ) la difficulté est au rendez-vous.

-------------
Après notre WE, on a pas pu faire 4 scénarios :
- Difficulté très élevée
- temps de jeux très long

On s'amuse, même si sa frustre mais c'est un jeu clairement destiné aux hardcore gamers !

The rules are too much. You always need to look after keywords and trigger for the scenario and the scenarios are not that good/balanced as I expected. I think the ideas of movement cards, scenarios, the time line and diseases are really really great, but most of the time you are running after your target and by the way you try to open locked doors and drawers . It is a really beautiful game with so much potential, but in my oppinion they did not use the potential. Tried playing it a few times, but really did not have any fun, except for enjoying the beautiful material. Already sold it and hope the new owner will have more fun with it.

There's an awesome game here if it had some more polish in the gameplay. It's fun and reasonably complex, but the effort involved at entry is huge considering the need for all the (albeit great) fan-made rule books and aids on BGG.

RATING: 9.5
Congratulations Titan Forge. This game is amazing. Yes, we need a new rulebook but this game is dripping with theme. Once you get over the rules it has so many neat concepts:


+ Insmonia track is a nice push-your-luck and pressure mechanic 
+ nice search-system - I hate games where you can search unlimited times - this way it is done so right; love it 
+ Memory-Cards: great level-up mechanic with flavour 
+ very dark theme: Man, these monsters are tough and brutal (the Slashers are a gaming nightmare :) - in this game you want to try to avoid as many combats as possible 
+ great choices in this game (which skills to use? taking insanity damage?) 
+ wonderul developed mechanics into the setting - did i already say that this game is dripping with theme? 
+ fantastic board design - it is so easy to draw LOS etc. 
+ great distinctive player roles because of skills etc. 
+ monster movement is easy 
+ stellar artwork 
+ brutal difficulty :) 
+ multi-scenario-approach in one game-shot is very innovative
+ sandbox nature (mix in boss and special monsters as you wish)
+ insane replay value


- luck based - without any skills and weapons you are lost :) 
- rulebook is badly organized - you will lose a lot of potential players here 
- the spots where to put markers on (game board) is difficult to decipher in some cases
- takes much longer to play than mentioned in the rulebook (2 scenarios take 5 hours easily)

All in all: Stellar game! This game needs positive buzz now! It is so unique and one of the best themed miniatures games out there.

Fantastic game. The theme is captured in a great way. Many great elements like the random doors, the secret lockers, the random tiles give an unlimited replayability. You´ll never get the same map twice. The monsters are the ones you know from classic horror movies like the little girl or the clown, but also crazy ones like pigs with knifes or an evil tire. They have all their own abilities and feel really different. The same with the heroes...they have their own decks mixed with generic cards, wich makes them unique but also different each time. The fact that the heroe´s special abilities need some time to be recharged and that the weapons use up forces you to interesting decisions. This is not a simple slayer but a clever game. Component quality is excellent. If you love horror different from zombies and you love randomness and chaos (wich creates sometimes unbalanced situations), then this game is what you want.

Very happy with this game, much to my great surprise. I backed it on KS principally because I liked the art and the miniatures, figuring this would be a forgettable Zombicide knock-off with some cool bits. 

But lo and behold, it's actually really fun! It is not only much more challenging than Zombicide (which has always been my biggest criticism of Zombicide - it's too easy), but it has some interesting mechanics in the player powers that I did not expect. I love how lots of weapons and powers let you roll 7 or 8 dice at once, which really satisfies the dice-chucker in me, but planning the use of powers and timing them properly is very satisfying to the Eurogamer in me. For some reason, this game hits on a lot of cylinders.

My biggest complaint has to do with the auxiliary components. The rulebook is not great, the dice that come with the game are of a very cheap quality, and the spaces for doors and lockers on the board are impossible to see. Thankfully, the BGG community has stepped up and made some these problems easily solvable with a revised rulebook, index, and player/set-up aids. Thanks, BGGers!

RATING: 9
The rulebook is not completely clear in some issues and misses a shortlist off all the actions we can/must do each turn.
Miniatures are spectacular, mechanics make each decision strategic, artwork gets you in the ambiance of the game. Scenarios leave space for many, many runs of the game and also for some extra combinations if you want to.
At the end is a game for mental disorder players that must work together!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The cooldown mechanic for the skills is both interesting and mildly annoying (since you want your skills to be ready all the time) and also a bit fiddly with the markers, but this doesn't detract from an overall enjoyable game. The only downsides are the long playing time and the fact that you will often ruin perfectly useful weapons trying to get through locked doors fast.

RATING: 6
Okay, where should I start.

This game looks gorgeous. It is at CMON level at least. The base game has many things already. Overall I had fun only just from looking at the table.

However this game has some flows.
-setups is extremely  tedious
-a normal scenario, where you complete 2  tasks after each other, is like 2-3 hours long AFTER the setup
-even if there are some strategy deepness I missed more ways to actually manipulate the dice rolls -> there are more luck involved what I like
-since this I think this can get boring after a few plays

If you like to paint then buy it for sure. Otherwise try it 1st.

Update from 7 to 6:
Massive Darkness and even Zombicide -besides the theme- does everything way better.

Get the player aid on here though, and if you own then have a solo test run so you arn't rulebook searching all game, and its all good. 
Nice replay-ability with multiple scenarios and not just kill x amount of z missions, quite thematic, still at its heart a dungeon crawler though.

Definately best horror themed miniature game on market right now. Everything is done just right. Miniature quality - it is better then cool mini games, if you dont believe just put the miniature from both companies together and you will see it (the quality difference between Lobotomy and Zombicide:BP is enormous, in favour of Lobotomy, the zombies in black plauge look like blobs in this comparision).
Board and cards quality - boards are ok, artwork is great but they have tendency to bend, or my copy is flawed. Cards are very good, item artwork is fantastic, skill artwork is ok, without graphics but very thematic. Monster and character graphics are amazing, the style is so different than the other games, so disturbing but hitting the horror/dream world spot.
Dice - they are just there, low/medium quality, but i hope those custom dice would be better.
Gameplay - game is long but after several session we are able to play 1 hour - 1:30 per scenario without setup (so 2 hours combined). 2 scenario games are player 2:30 + depends if we win or lose. If we win the game is usually over 3 hours (but with setup you have to count about 4 hours). You can play faster of course but we like to take our time. Experienced players should be able to play 2 scenario game with setup in 3 hours I guess. Gameplay is great, this is where the game shines. The decisionmaking is the most important part, you have 10 things to do, and time just to barely do one, you have to split team, deal the tasks and often sacrifice someone and you still will be on the edge. The game is typical ameritrash style so luck is involved in many situations, the bad rolls can screw you over (you can mitigate some of them in various ways) and a great rolls can find you a way from an impossible situation.
TitanForge and kickstarter - they made me wait a long time for a game, but delivered a top quality product. Still I have some issues with their communication and delivery time but I am proud to have lobotomy on my shelf. If there ever be a Lobotomy 2 then I will be their first backer :-)

Delivery expected Aug 2016 -delayed...
New: expected some copies october, most later...!?
Another company which gives no reliable data about there project..., could be the last project I'll back from them!

They don't know how imortant their customers are and it seems they don't care. If they continue they will feel it on the next project!
Next estimated delivery should be in November 2016!??

Next... maybe February...2017... (7 month late!)
Received the delivery February 17th 2017 (Germany)!

Updated my rating from "1" in accordance the delays now after receiving to an average "6" because of many typos in the rule book and on cards...
They're working on an updated rulebook..., that's never a good sign if you ggot such a message during the delivery has started... Expectations were high..., maybe to high!??? 
The content looks good (up to fantastic), the feeling with the dark graphics on tiles and cards seems hitting right, but we have to check the gameplay first before I could give a "game" rating!

But many miniatures are broken from the base and have to be fixed and clued again... poor quality in design!

Some really interesting ideas here but far too many moving parts, which grind the game play down making it slow and stilted. [i]EVERY[/i]thing costs an action and you have a very limited number of them on your turn, so some turns consist of you simply trying to open a door, or maybe you make it three steps down a corridor.

It also vexes me that the damnable tokens are bigger than the spaces upon which they are supposed to sit, and the spaces on each board are not as clear as they could be
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I didn't expect much... but man, this is a tight dungeon crawler with a lot of interesting stuff going on. Each session is a kind of mini campaign that has multiple objectives. The combat system is simple but feels weighty; your weapons are not only a club or lobotomy spike or whatever, but a resource, able to smash things like doors at the cost of durability. Events may trigger one of three sub-effects based on the mission. And then there's the character variety, with some scheming during setup to pick your two most useful abilities out of four, but then drawing an additional stack of abilities from the various mental issue decks and choosing one. The same character can feel totally different from game to game, especially if you're an especially nutty character like Alice who gets four mental health draws. Every ability has a cooldown mitigated by time, and you're rewarded for fighting by ticking the cooldown forward when you kill something. 

All in all, Titan Forge actually got a design right. Way better than most of that Zombicide-inspired trash out there.

There is a significant set up time to play, however it does result in character development and a thematic deepening of the game. Except for the dice the components are of excellent quality. The dice however are a significant step down (the d12 rolled forever. I quickly replaced it.) there is a wonderful manic quality and tension that ratchets up during game play.  It does take quite a bit of time to play, and I've only attempted single scenarios at this point. During play there's a lot of give-and-take and one of the first games that, for me, successfully forces me to barter sanity against action needs. I've seen the mechanic in plenty of games, but this one constantly has me thinking about it and really develops the insanity theme. 

 The complexity level is there, and you will certainly need to exploit options in the rules in order to successfully manage a scenario. It is a difficult Game and defeat arrives often. Depending on your group you could spend a lot of time picking through the rules or simply accept that you'll miss some opportunities. 

You can tell a lot of thought and love went into this game. For me it's definitely fun to play and I love the thematic twists. There are plenty of variables and possibilities for character development to keep the base game fresh and compelling.  

I've seen a lot of comments that the rules were unclear. However I found the manual to answer all my questions but would certainly recommend downloading @judgmentdave's player aid.

After about 15 plays (2 scenario games only - so normal difficulty in rulebook).
VERY difficult game but very rewarding. This is not a party game like Zombicide so I think that those people would not be interested in it. This is a product for advanced gamers who like challenges and like to think during a game.
Game is fast paced but not the first tries.
Rulebook is very very bad (this is the cause I was mad at this game at first).
No player aids is something which some people will not forgive (I need to have open this HUGE rulebook all the time and search for example for a meaning of the stars).
Excellent game, I love it for sure but bad rulebook and lack of player aids is a thing for titan forge to thing about.

Original themed dungeon-crawler-like, this game is more then ever fustrating and mean with the players. Many events will reduce your progression, many times dice rolling will make you fail your action, many monsters are just too tough for you, scenarios keep starting and giving you so much to do with so less actions.... it's long, it's full of little rules that you will forget...

Still, it's so good.

Underdeveloped game. Has too many rules, keywords and things to look up and the way dice work is too complex and often different. Also too many different types of cards.

Players: 2-5
Time: 60-180 minutes (based on number of chosen scenarios)
Players take on the roles of patients who are trying to cooperatively complete objectives in an asylum. They imagine horrible monsters instead of patients and nurses. This game has a great horror theme. When a patient recalls a memorable, the flavor text is great and adds to the mood. Players must accomplish objectives while exploring the asylum, finding items, weapons, meds, and recalling memories that unlock skills. Each character is unique and there are plenty to choose from. This is a difficult game to win and each game has felt different from the last.

Saw it in Essen and bought game there, never heard about kickstarter campaign unfortunately. Rated after 4 plays. Game is not complicated but have a lot of depth. Gameplay is very original, the insanity system, cooldowns and micromanaging your character is awesome. Each character is different like playing totally different game, thats the best thing.
I havent played 4 scenario game yet but in 3 scenario game there is a lot to track (a lot of surges and some scenarios are very complex) - thats the minus because you need to check those things in the manual, reference cards will be better. 2 scenario game is the best.

First of all we were not sure to buy this game, because of the rulebook comments. Nevertheless we received our copy last weekend as we are super enthusiastic about the theme!

Having played it several times, our experience is:

- rulebook is absolutely fine! Read through it thoroughly in 2-3 hours, which is absolutely fun to do as well (!) and you are ready to go
- absolutely usefell then is a rulebook summary to keep close when playing, can be found on bgg (https://boardgamegeek.com/file/download/v8a52orm06/Lobo_Summary.pdf)
- the rulebook is missing an index, but that can be found on bgg as well (https://boardgamegeek.com/file/download/vt8dtchaw6/Lobotomy_Manual_Index_%28small_full_colour%29.jpg)
- to find your way through the map tiles and highlighted doors and bodies, use the digital map to be found on bgg (https://boardgamegeek.com/file/download/v8mr2lzacu/JD%27s_Map_Cards_v1.pdf)

If you then still have any questions, please go through https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1657695/lobotomy-faq-rules-and-scenarios

Amazing how the developers worked on the theme and did a great job on the game mechanics! It's absolutely not an easy game, you really have to work for it. Nevertheless, a great job!

The rulebook and cards need a LOT of refining.  The instruction manual makes critical things like "How many actions does it take to use this skill" really unclear, and the skill/item cards don't always have an action cost specified on them.  This could be a 7/10 if you could play without having to look up so many basic rules questions on forums.

I love a good miniatures game, and there's certainly a lot to love here. I got the Kickstarter, with the big expansion and a few extra characters/enemies too. The box is pretty big, but that's good as you can fit everything (including expansions) inside. That's something I do really appreciate in a game. The box is big and sturdy too. The artwork on the box (and everywhere else) is very good and thematic. The miniatures are, quite simply, superb (last game I opened was Project Elite, this is an amazing difference in quality!). There's a lot of detail on a lot of these creatures and I'm very impressed with the miniature quality. Lots of cardboard tokens, which are decent thickness and come out of the insert just fine. All superb so far.

My first negative is the rulebook. The rule booklet looks nice and has good paper quality. The rules, themselves, aren't all that well written. I appreciate that English is not the native language of the developer, but I think that more could have been done to get some English proof reading done. There are many spelling mistakes, with lots of grammar mistakes too. Rules could have been written better to reference page numbers, if a rule directs you to somewhere else. Other rules just aren't clear enough, which leads to needing house rulings. In short, the Rulebook could use some attention.

I have another negative, regarding the board pieces. I think that the design and art on the board pieces are all top notch. The pieces all fit together very nicely. However, we noticed that the pieces would bend upwards during the game. So, all the corners would rise the longer we played. During setup, I saw a slight bend on some of the pieces. So I made sure to put the "raised corners" down to touch the table - to make it easier to play. However, by the end of the game every board piece had warped itself to have the corners facing up! I'm not sure what to make of this, as the pieces don't look to tend in only one direction. It did take a bit from the game, when our flat board area got warped the longer the game went on. I'm not sure if this is something that affects other people?

To gameplay then! Actually no, lets setup first. I normally wouldn't mention this bit, but setup does take quite a while (since everything has to come out of the box to get at the board pieces at the bottom). And space. It's a big board with a lot of things to be placed on it, depending on the initial scenario. We purposely have a big kitchen table, just for games like this, so I don't particularly think of this as a negative. But I know some players who won't enjoy the setup time (if we were to invite people over, it's the kind of game you have setup for them arriving). 

Finally to gameplay! The first turns took us a while to figure out how things actually worked. However, once we got moving - we found we could get through turns very quickly. While the game looks very intimidating to start, you find that the monsters don't move very quickly - so it is normally fairly easy for any human player to stay ahead of them if they want to avoid fighting. Combat is, actually, fairly simple once you understand it (roll dice, count hits, remove hits based on defense). The basic monsters (patients, nurses, scavengers) aren't very dangerous and can be dealt with easily by any character when alone. Mini bosses are something different, of course. And the final boss looks particularly tricky - though we've never encountered him yet.... 

The game is a variation of a dungeon crawl. While that's not particularly new, if you get into the role play of the game then you will see something new in this game. Your character is, literally, crazy. When he sees and attacks a "Scavenger", in reality he's actually attacking another patient, or a doctor, or possibly even a potted plant! That dangerous club he has in his hands, might be nothing more than a tv remote in reality. The adventure is all in the minds of the protagonists! I found that getting into the spirit of the game really allowed me to enjoy it much more. 

There are a lot of board pieces in this game, which affect play differently. There are a lot of player characters (even without considering purchasing extras). There are also a lot of mini bosses, with associated scenarios. In other words, there is a lot of replayability in this game. The bad point of having a lot of pieces is that tidying up the game afterwards does take a bit of time. Still, a small cost to bear I think!

Overall, I think this is a very solid game. The theme is really good (I was always a fan of the Silent Hill video games) and well adapted to the gameplay (ie, not just tacked on). The rulebook takes away a little - but I know that fans are offering up rewrites, so a re-released rulebook will surely be somewhere on the horizon. That little niggle aside, this is a game I really hope to get to play quite often.

Lobotomy is the first large Kickstarter I've backed. The wait was...long, but the final product was worth it. The miniatures are great and most of the component are well made. I did notice the board tiles are prone to warping a little.

The rule book is a little crazy (yeah I did that), but once you dedicate some time to it the game actually flows pretty smoothly. Aside from that and some minor spelling errors (even on some cards), the game isn't half bad. 

If I had to make a healthy comparison to another game, it would have to be Mansions of Madness (which I prefer over this).

All in all Lobotomy is a good game, but there are other games of the same genre that do it better. I'll still enjoy it for quite some time I'm sure.

"Gameplay consisting entirely of random rolls with no interesting decisions."

Aside from the horrible rulebook a truly fun play that will run you about an hour and a half per selected scenario, with an additional setup of half an hour.

A good game, and one that I really want to like more than I do.  The theme is so ever-present in this game and there are so many cool minis and stories to play out.  I still think that there are some slight "problems" with the rules, and things aren't quote as smoother as I would hope them to be.

But overall a very enjoyable game and one that I am happy to have in my collection.

Very cool atmosphere, high replay value, cool miniatures. Would score higher with a good rulebook (that should be released early 2017).
I recommend the Lobotomy player aid file here on BGG, it simplifies looking up a bunch of rules.

Bad experience. They where responsive during the campaign, but once done it was over.
Also no 2 player rules (and asked during the campaign, when they said there would be).
Never backing this company again.
Rulebook is a disaster.
Setup a chore.

Absolutly fantastic. Sets a new Standard for Horror themed board games. Only downside is the rulbook is slightly incomplete. However a PDF file exists which corrects these minor errors. You can find it in this section under "Files".

A pesar de sus fallos de edición, es un buen juego de miniaturas con un buen tema, mecánicas interesantes para no ser un tira-dados descontrolado y bastante rejugabilidad a través de sus diferentes escenarios y configuraciones. Si hubieran presentado un mejor manual, unas ayudas de juego para hacer más llevadera la entrada en este juego y hubieran pulido los espacios de las losetas para que fueran más claras y no tan estrechas podría ser un juego de notable alto o incluso sobresaliente pero tal y como está ahora se queda en el 7 que sin ser ninguna maravilla, me parece bastante disfrutable.

Nice game overall, even though a bit too much focus on dice rolling for my taste.
For a eye-pleasing game the dice are very plain looking, as are most of the health and skill tracking tokens. I do love the theme and the tongue-in-cheek humor.

If there ever would be a second edition of this, with rule fixes and some tweaks I might buy this one. As it is, it's fun once in a while but simply not good enough (as I have too many games as it is)

This game is awesome. I love the mechanics and the theme is off the chain. The rules are a bear to sift through. Download the revised edition and player aids from boardgamegeek. The miniratures are really cool and Im gonna have a blast painting them. There are some innovative mechanics such as the Doom track which the Warden Walks. I love how the psychosis are powers. I bought a full kickstarter version overpriced on ebay, but glad I did for all the extra cool looking minis.

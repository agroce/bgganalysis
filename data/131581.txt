RATING: 6.5
It's a roll-to-move game that doesn't make me want to scratch out my eyes. Actually manages to be quite tense. It's silly.

Anyone playing this for 45 minutes each way is insane and has too much time on their hands. Keep it to 20 minutes a half.

Very fun and easy to learn and play. Most of the optional rules are a must to get a actually soccer match feel. Also it fits on kitchen table. My subbuteo table can get a breather

Good simulation for soccer playing. Some extended rules should be added in order to make it more realistic. Good for soccer fans and non-gamer.  Highly recommend for causal play!

Jogo de futebol "da hora". Simples de tudo, fácil aprendizado, até as crianças podem participar. É simplesmente irresistível quando alguém o vê montado numa mesa, parceiros pra jogo você vai encontrar com muita facilidade.
As regras avançadas tornam o jogo muito mais atraente e oferecem tudo: Escanteios, laterais, faltas, pênaltis, impedimentos, e por aí vai. Se você não liga para rolagem de dados, estude o SOCCERO pois não é um jogo barato.
Se tivesse investimento nacional acho que ele seria um sucesso!

I love this game! It's mainly luck mitigation but you can make it as long or short as you want. (I like my games of chance, but I like them short.) It really gives you a soccer-y feel and the components are top notch. Oddly enough I played it with a friend's son - a ten year old soccer fanatic - who didn't like it. I think it would have gone over better with a house rule for flicking the ball instead of using the pass/shoot dice. Regardless, I'm glad I got it.

A Brilliant game that gets a lot better with the optional rules that you can bolt on as then it does become a lot like soccer. Adding player detail/skills is a good way of improving it.

Extremely fun if played with a 30sec-1m timer per turn. Feels like a real soccer game if played that way.

A nice chips and pretzels game for soccer fans.

RATING: 7.4
Solid and great looking soccer game simulation involving roll and move, or kick the ball turn action. The game forces the ball to be passed frequently between team players and allows the ball to be taken from the opposing team only on an exact roll onto the ball carrier. It works and if your are really into "football" I can recommend this game. The best of the soccer games simulations I have played so far.

This game is quite good. I am the designer of a Soccer game that, in my own opinion, is not up to this one. I have been trying to improve mine, but then I tested Soccero and felt it is a much better game.

I believe it probably needed a bit more testing to streamline the rules, but I still have to play it using the advanced rules which I feel, after a single reading, will make the game a lot more enjoyable and dynamic (will update after playing with them).

The art is quite dry, the designers could have done a bit more, but unilke my own case, they spent their time making a good game while I wasted too much energy doing a complex game that was also visually stunning, not to mention a lot harder to produce.

If you like soccer and boardgames, Soccero is the way to go (until I improve Stratgol, of course, XD).

very easy rules and a lot of fun!
17-02-2018 Using extended and variant rule plus one house rule:
carrying the ball is permitted even if one defender is in front.
With this house rule the game is much quicker and we feel more soccer like!

RATING: 6
Nice beer (and probably best after at least three beers) and pretzel game that captures the feel of a soccer game. Not a deep strategy game, lots of dice rolling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game.  Great feel of the game as well.  Love the die rolling to determine movement, passing distance and shots/saves on goal.  Easily customizable to give a better and more realistic experience.  We use subbuteo teams and custom player standees with our home brew rules to give this the ultimate experience.  This rating is based on the game as is (Basic & Extended Rules) before our home brew customizations.  With customizations, a solid 10.  Great components to get you started in the world of soccer.

Not bad! This was actually fun, and quite intense. Well, playing the full 2x45 minutes would probably be way too long, but a 2x25 minute game was rather exciting. The rules are simple and work well. 

Indifferent.

For a sports game, this actually may be a good one. Each player gets a given amount of time to do as much as they can. Most of the rules make sense and it looks decently fun.

Captures some essential feel of the sport. Rule set allows for easy customization, potentially really making this shine. Subbuteo teams work fine with this one.

Very fun game which does a very good job of representing a game of footie.  Very nice minis and board.  Will be getting my own copy soon!

i am no a sports fan, but this game is really good.  The components are great. The game rules are easy to learn ad follow. The advance rules add more detail but the the game will loose it elegance and fun. buy this game if you can find it. Don't let the dice rolling throw you as a push your luck mechanism.  There is lots of game tactics as well as strategy in play here.

Nice bits in a nice insert but otherwise contains no originality to differentiate the product from other mass market games based on 1980s gameplay.

StreetSoccer does all this faster and more elegantly, or Champions 2020 if more complexity is needed.

GREAT FUN - REAL SOCCER FEEL
Lots of soccer flavor with minimal rules overhead.  Need more plays to judge for certain but this feels like a winner.  If you enjoy StreetSoccer but are looking for something with more depth this game is for you.

C'est léger... comme je le voulais et comme je m'y attendais. Ça coule bien, pas trop de règle inutile, le matériel est très bien. Mais 2 demie de 45 minutes, c'est un peu trop...

I think I lose my heavy gamer tag over this game. 

Boy oh boy was this fun! It wasn't the most brain-burning game under the sun but it was just so fantastic. Intense and thrilling when using the timers, definitely something football fans should check out.

Not one to pass up on a soccer game this one reminds me of a few different game mechanics.  The use of the pass die and limits on the runner make things flow nicely.  It's designed to play smooth and relatively quick between turns which is a good thing.  There are much more detailed games out there that take field positions into more account.

This is a pretty good football game and gets an extra point for looking like a small scale Subbuteo (I get soooo nostalgic).  There is something missing around the goal scoring and tackling departments though.  Scoring goals is far too easy; no matter where on the pitch a shot's taken from, the goalie will fail to save it if he rolls < 5 (or 6 if it's a lob).  That's not right. Neither is the only way for the player in posession to come out of a tackle with the ball a foul.  I think some house rules might be in order.

After 3 plays, really enjoyed it.  Nice pieces, but I did decide to use my subbeuteo teams with it.  10 year old son ,who knows the rules of soccer, requests to play which makes it even better.

Much more strategic than I thought and very fun.  I don't know about the egg timers since our game turns were fast.

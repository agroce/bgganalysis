It's roll n' move...it's virtually themeless (why would merchants stack their rugs and let a dude walk all over them??) but it's still so much fun. The rug pieces make the game...I'm a sucker for cool bits.

Βρισκόμαστε στο εξωτικό Μαρακές όπου ο Χασάν προσπαθεί να πουλήσει τα χαλιά μας στην τοπική αγορά. Λίγο το όμορφο κουτί, τα πολύχρωμα components, ο συμπαθής Χασάν και η αγάπη μου για το Μαρόκο, με έπεισαν να κάτσω για μια δοκιμή. Άλλωστε το παιχνίδι είναι και βραβευμένο με Spiel de Jahr το 2008.

Οι κανόνες είναι πολύ απλοί. Στο ταμπλό υπάρχει μόνο ένα πιόνι, ο Χασάν. Στην γύρα μας στρίβουμε, αν θέλουμε, τον Χασάν και ρίχνουμε ένα ζάρι να δούμε πόσο θα προχωρήσει (1 με 4 με μεγαλύτερες πιθανότητες στο 2,3). Αν σταματήσει πάνω σε χαλί αντιπάλου τότε πρέπει να τον πληρώσουμε. Μετά στρώνουμε εμείς ένα από τα χαλιά μας και μπορούμε να καλύψουμε μερικώς τα χαλιά των αντιπάλων.

Νικητής είναι αυτός που έχει στο τέλος το μεγαλύτερο άθροισμα από χρήματα και εμφανή χαλιά. Άρα προσπαθείς να προβλέψεις που θα πάει ο Χασάν και να τοποθετήσεις τα χαλιά σου ανάλογα. Επίσης όσο μεγαλύτερο εμβαδό έχουν τα συνεχόμενα χαλιά σου τόσο περισσότερα χρήματα θα λάβεις.

Όμορφα και πολύχρωμα components. Ξεχωρίζουν φυσικά τα χαλιά των παικτών, το μεγάλο ζάρι αλλά και το μουστάκι του Χασάν. Το ταμπλό γράφει ωραία στο μάτι όταν έχει γεμίσει χαλιά. Αυτό το μίνι 3D effect μετράει.

Ωραίο οικογενειακό παιχνίδι. Όμορφο, απλό και σύντομο. Δεν έχει αρκετό βάθος αλλά τα ασυνήθιστα components το κάνουν να ξεχωρίζει. Είναι το καλύτερο παιχνίδι απλώματος χαλιών που έχω παίξει.

La temática del juego está muy bien adaptada. A pesar de eso es un juego abstracto pero con la influencia del dado. 
En juego de 2 uno de los jugadores puede recibir una paliza.
En juego de 4 se equipara un poco, pero el dado sigue influenciando. Sin embargo, si se juega con ánimo light puede ser muy dvertido.

I'd saw this at a discount store for a while. After finally reading reviews here on the B'Geek, I decided to pick it up. Luckily the $9.99 w/ a 30% post-Christmas discount made this a great game at a great price---because I'm cheap.

This game feels good. It is a great tactile experience. I just like to sit and feel this game and its pieces.

The game play is great too.

This is a fantastic family game! The components are great. The cloth rugs are perfect for this game. It seems like the perfect amount of luck for a family game. Choices for which way to make the guy go are pretty easy (which again is good for a family game), but where to place your rugs is not always as obvious. Turns go quickly, so the game has a nice brisk pace to it. This is a very fun, light game.

Okay filler or children's game.  Decisions are usually obvious and there's lots of luck in the die roll.  Fair amount of "hurt the leader" and associated diplomacy.  Very cute components (miniature felt carpets), but the theme is not very logical.

This game is just fun and a great game to play as a filler or with players who are not strong strategically.  With the dice being such a prominent part of the game, there is obviously quite a bit of luck.  The rules are so simple that you can do a few easy variants and make it play quite differently each time.

Ultimately this is a good game to play when girls are around or with children.

Juego de cubrir areas con alfombras árabes. De dos a cuatro jugadores. Facil de jugar y explicar. En cada turno, el jugador orienta a un peón llamado hasam y avanza tantas posiciones como indique un dado. Si cae en una alfombra de otro jugador, deberá pagarle tantas unidades como celdas adyacentes estén ocupadas por la alfombra del mismo color que está pisando. Posteriormente, puede colocar una alfombra propia tapando parcialmente otras alfombras de otros jugadores. Está entretenido. Apto para todo el público y rápido de jugar.

I'll confess:  I have no idea why I like this game so much.  Okay, I am a huge fan of carpets, so the little baby carpets help a lot, but I also enjoy the game play.  There's a bit of push your luck in the decision of which way to point the guy and some tactical thinking when deciding whether to try to build a single big expanse of carpet (which will be a target for opponents) or several smaller areas.

Dans "Marrakech", vous avez des tapis, autant que vos adversaires, et Assan, le marchand, va se déplacer sur le plateau a chaque tour, pour chaque joueur. Et quand Assan s'arrete, d'abord il vérifie s'il est sur un tapis, si oui, il doit payer une Dime au propriétaire (sauf si c'est le joueur actif) en fonction du nombre de cases recouvertes. Ensuite, il dépose l'un des tapis du joueur actif, en suivant une ou deux petites regles... Forcément, vous aurez compris qu'en déposant ses tapis, on va obliger les autres a payer une dime a un moment ou a un autre, et, surtout, on peut les recouvrir, ce qui va vous faire marquer des points (et en retirer aux autres).

Wow, this is a lot more fun and interesting than I thought it would be.  The random element (die rolling) outweighs good tactical play, I think, but it is still entertaining as long as you don't take it too seriously, which I find easy to do because it is a quick game.  If you get boned on rolls, just play it again!

RATING: N/A
Roll-and-move where you lay actual bits of textile carpets on the board. Takes a long time to get going before the board starts to fill up with carpets, so even though it's nice and short with some great moments of tension, half the game is a boring slog to get to the interesting part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not much to it, but a charming and fun game.  The luck of the die has a big impact on whether you make (or have to pay) money, but it also adds the unpredictability that makes the game fun.  Overall, a clever little design that would work very well with families.

Original use of silly pieces of cloth, giving the game a tiny 3D aspect.

A unique little game that should be added to the list of great gateway games.  For me and mine, this has been the biggest hit since Cartagena.  Heavily luck-based, especially once everyone fully grasps the strategy (which doesn't go very deep), but definitely a game that induces a lot of groans, laughs and trash talk.

Fun little family game. The carpet placement decisions don't seem difficult --- just cover up two opponents' carpets if possible, with preference given to the opponents with the greatest number of visible carpets.

Nice carpets!

Simplistic gameplay, but the tactile sensation given by the felt carpet components is quite unique and really caught the attention of my friends who I showed this to.

A quick, extremely easy game. Roll a die to move a shared player marker and place carpets accordingly. I love the felt carpets and the fake shadows falling across the market square.

Played once.  It didn't grab me.  Half way through the game, I realized that this game is very similar to monopoly.  Sure, there's a little more going on here, and this certainly is a better game, but the similarities are there.  Roll a die, move a piece.  If you land on someone's carpet (property), you pay them based on how developed that property is (how large the run of carpet is).  That's pretty much where the similarities end, though.  This game takes about half an hour.

Played at BayCon2012.

Beautifully made game with the  gigamatic quality we have come to expect.

Simple roll and move mechanic for the market manager and simple rules on placement, however the gameplay is quite tactical... do I place my carpets out of the way where I might not earn money for them but then they are less likely to be overlayed by the other players or do I dump them in the middle and milk them for profits until they are eventually overlayed by the other players?

A surprise hit for me, a lot to enjoy here. I really liked the physical form the game takes as the carpets build up. It does seem like a carpet shop in the Souk. I liked the simple movement of the Seller, and the money and dice were nicely made too. The game was very quick, with simple decisions, but not without tension as you can be forced into paying if you're not careful. The rules fit onto one page, but only by making the font very small. But it's a simple game with a strong take-that element.

This game is short, fun, has surprising amounts of strategy, and is excellent for more casual games. I especially love to bring this one out with people who don't play that many games.

RATING: 9
As a game I consider this to be a perfect design. The mechanism of weaving carpets could only be achieved by using actual cloth, so the connection between theme and mechanism is seamless (!). The use of an 'averaging' dice enables you to easily assess the odds of how risky a particular move may be. You can also 'steer' your opponent by how you place your carpet.
The only down point is that Zoch had the Suleika version produced in China, which means that the card used in the box and board is not up to German quality - though the other components are excellent (I don't know where the Gigamic version was produced).

Obviously a cute game and an idea that I haven't seen before. It is definitely a game that is best for the kids, but it has some interesting decisions to make that gives it a point above some of the common children games. Plus the pieces are lovely! I find it is a little slow build up any real tension, with most of the moves being avoidance moves until the end of the game where there is really no escape. The kids do like it however and it may be a pleasant diversion with the adults I play with.

I LOVE this game. It plays quick and looks great. The little carpets are made from fabric and work really well, for the games purpose. Basically an area majority, abstract game, but there's just something about his game that is a lot of fun. I can play this one over and over again and have a blast, as it plays quick. 

Basically you roll a die to move a pawn, of which you can rotate on turn, to change his direction. Move the pawn. If you land on an empty space or your own carpet. You're fine. Land on someone elses carpet and you pay them for each section of their carpet, that's adjacent to another. Then you lay one of your carpet adjacent to the pawn. Trying to cover up your opponents carpets and connect more of yours. Keep doing this until everyone plays all their carpets and then you get points for your money leftover and for each section of your carpet, that are still showing on the board. Whoever has the most points then wins.

A lot more fun than it sounds. Not quite sure why, but it's just a great little fun game. I picked this up for 10 bucks new. Definitely worth it, if not even double that price or more. Check it out. I'd definitely recommend this, for a quick filler, family game.

Many thanks, to my good friend Matt, for picking this up for me.

Interesting concept, but it's spoiled by excessive randomness. Set the direction of the little guy, roll a die and, if he ends on an opponent's rug, pay money equal to the size of the area covered. Then, lay one of your rugs on an adjacent square, possibly overlapping others. There are some tactics in placing your rugs, but regarding the movement, you are faced too frequently with a best obvious choice. There is some calculation of probabilities, but the die, of course, often acts against them. This may work as a very light family game, but it might be better if you chose the direction of movement after you rolled the die, not before. On the production, the cloth rugs are a nice touch.

Home made. Hand painted. Szebb, mint az eredeti 8). Nem tudom milyen a gyári, de a mi plüss szőnyegeinket még fogni is kellemes, nem hogy játszani vele. A tervezés és a festés sokáig tartott, de legalább színes és változatos lett a tábla, a figura lépése így teljesen egyértelmű. A játékkal egyébként minden korosztály szívesen játszik. Mi 15 szőnyeggel játszunk négy főnél is (mivel minden színből van annyi..), így kicsit több pénzt lehet kisajtolni egymásból. A kocka eredményezhet meglepetéseket, de nem ezen múlik a játék. Egyik kedvencem (sokat is bíbelődtem vele), és a játékélmény is mindenkinél pozitív. A bolti kb. 7 rugó kicsit sok érte.

Marrakech is a nice family game. The rule of game is very simple and easy to learn. Playing time is about 30 minutes so that it is suitable for children. Above all, the game provides beautiful components. Especially, Carpets are made of real fiber. Thus, the game looks nice and parts are very noticeable. Wooden coins also offer enough satisfaction to gamers. Even though the game is not enough for someone who love strategic games, Marrakech is still a good choice for family members.

Marrakech is a fun, light game that plays under an hour and is best with 4 players. Plays move then lay down carpets to try to make the largest contiguous areas of their colour to both score points at the end and have others land on their squares and pay them money. You are eliminated if your run out of money but I don't know how that could happen because there appears to be too much money in the game to start with. That's maybe the only flaw with this game.

Very very simple game.  This is random, but the biggest problem here is that for more than 1/2 of the game nothing interesting happens.  Assam just walks and walks and walks...

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2013)

An ok game. Its strength lays in the very short play time, otherwise I would hate the game as it has lots of “take that” and luck (with the die), both aspects I have come to dislike in longer games. The easy rules and gameplay also make me like this little game. The components are very unusual and they command a lot of attention (the rugs) and the coins are gorgeous. I’m indifferent to the theme and I don’t feel it when I play Marrakech.

I find the game to be very light for my tastes, the decisions are (more or less) obvious but it is fun to see if you end your movement in another player´s terrain, if so you have to pay a la Monopoly.

The idea of the game is so simple, you can explain it under 2 minutes, making it perfect for non-gamers and/or family. It is nice that the game rules come in many languages, however the game seems a little expensive for what it offers. 

Bottom line, I would play again (from time to time), but this is not a game I would want to buy. It needs the correct group to be enjoyed properly.

Underneath the (very attractive) packaging is a mix of roll and move and tile laying. Most moves are pretty obvious, but every now and then you have a choice between a low odds/high damage move and a higher odds/lower damage move. Do you feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya? I did, then rolled nasty and crashed and burned. And went bankrupt and thus out of the game. 'Never seen that before!' laughed Paul. Cheers.

Marrakech is probably the best roll and move game I've ever played.  As with most roll and move, there is a good amount of luck however, there is a high amount of strategy, both in turning the merchant and placing the carpets.  Each of these can set you up for success, even if a die roll is involved.  Trying to set yourself up to not have to step on any opponent rugs and being able to cover up their rugs as well is strategic and enjoyable.  This an excellent one and something I'd love to play over and over again.

RATING: 6.5
On your turn you can rotate Assam 90 degrees. Then roll the die and move. The odds are 1 in 6 for a 1 or a 4, but are 1 in 3 for a 2 or 3. You pay if you land on another person's carpet and the amount increases with the size of that patch. Then place one of your carpets adjacent to Assam and try to cover the other players' carpets. We found with three players it was a little too easy to avoid the other players' carpets. Scoring at the end is cash plus the number of squares covered. I would like to try it with four players.

These rug tiles (German Zoch edition) are so cool. Can somebody please create a good game around them? The first moves were fun when I started to see where this could go. After half the game I wondered when something will happen. The last 2 or 3 moves out of 15 in a three-player game got me annoyed. The game finally started as players were forced to pay for ending up on other players' rugs. In these moves, the game turned into a total crapshoot. All illusions of having an influence beyond a simple risk/probability calculation were destroyed. Only ok as a quick filler in family gaming.

A great little game to play with family or with non-gamers. The components are fantastic and the carpet-laying is a lot of fun. I recommend playing with the official variant of turning Assad at the end of your turn (for the next player), rather than turning him at the beginning of your turn for your own move. Using this variant, there will be more payouts and you won't have the problem of a fairly boring first half to two-thirds of the game as some have mentioned.

RATING: 6
I bought this on a lark because Tom Vasel spoke well of it on his podcast. He was right: the pieces are well done. The game consists of a bunch of carpets that you lay down on the board, trying to cover your opponents'. Each carpet covers two squares on the grid, which is around 6x6 or so. There are more squares of carpet than there are squares of grid, so with three players anyway, you end up covering each other up quite a bit. You then send this inspector around the board. The main choices are where to put the carpet, and how to move Ali (or Hussein or whatever his generic Arabic name is). Whenever he lands on your opponents' carpets you have to pay them, and you can only move him 90 degrees and then have to move according to a die roll. And those are the rules.

I played this for the first time with with my mother-in-law and wife, neither of whom particularly enjoy board games besides Scrabble, but they both seemed to like it. I got ahead early and they had trouble maneuvering the inspector enough to get a lot of money out of me. The game might suffer from a runaway leader thing, but it's well-produced, appropriate for children or nongamers, and not overly engaging for anyone else.

And, if they are all adjacent or linked together then the higher the payout will be.  Very cute.

Maybe it is just the different texture in playing with cloth patches...:) Decide which way Assam faces (anyway but a 180), roll the die to find out how many spaces to go, pay money due to owner of carpet landed upon, play your own piece of carpet.  Do this 12-15 times and the game is over.  There isn't much to the game and it does get old quickly - but it also plays very quickly.

Tetszenek a kis szőnyegek: szépek is és jó az anyaguk, olyan kicsit egymáshoz tapadós, nagyon bejön. Tetszik az is, hogy egy közös figurát irányítanak a játékosok, amivel lehet lépegetni, hogy fél perc alatt elmondható a szabálya, hogy a többieknek fizetett pénz interakciót visz bele, azon felül is, hogy a bábut merre vezetjük. A dobókocka sem okoz problémát, egyáltalán nem baj, hogy a szerencsét behozza a játékba, bőven belefér.

Két játékos szerintem kevés a játékhoz: zavaró például, hogy kétféle szőnyeget kell számon tartani. Három játékossal már jó lehet, néggyel pedig talán még jobb - ezt majd még kipróbálom.

A játékidő minimális, olyan negyed órára tippelem, szóval gyors a játék, és kevés helyet igényel. A pénzérmék kifejezetten tetszenek, szépek, jó az anyaguk. A játék előkészületei egy percbe beleférnek, a doboza viszont szerintem nagyobb a kelleténél, feleakkora is elég lenne.

Kedves kis játék, szeretem, és akarok még vele játszani, de kettőnél több játékossal.

Update: játszottuk hárman, de így sem az igazi: négy játékos esetén lehet a legjobb. Háromnál az volt a baj, hogy még pont maradt a táblán annyi üres hely, hogy a bábut jó eséllyel üres vagy saját szőnyegre lehessen vinni, az az 1-2 eset meg, amikor idegen szőnyegre érkezik, na, az dönti el a végeredményt. Ez viszont gyakorlatilag csak szerencse kérdése... Túl nagy a szerencse szerepe három játékos esetén.

Played 15-20 times.
Update: This is a recent hit with our 4-yo. We play by the rules and he wins about half of our games. I guess that proves that the game is completely random :-)
---
A lovely little game. Sure, the die rolls are important, but risk management is the key. I often find myself thinking "I can´t afford to pay 7 coins now, which will happen if I roll a 4 on that path. Thus, I choose this other path although the risk of having to pay anything between 1 and 3 is higher there."
Also, I think you can get too greedy here. If you have a big carpet area many players will rather choose a "cheaper" path and avoid your area at all cost, so you get no money at all.
Great components, and playing time is just right.

Sorry, but this game is too dull and the decisions too simple to be a suitable family game. The first half of the game involves very little landing on other people's carpets and the second half involves occasionally passing a dollar to someone.

I'm not against breezy games with short turns in which each turn has only a few possible choices, but at least make those choices different and compelling.

The game was much better than I thought it might be.  We played the variant rules which I thought would have a nastier gamer edge.  Simple mechanics, some luck and another amazing Gigamic title.  I can't wait to play this with my eight year old.

RATING: 8
2016-08-13: Gateway game with fantastic presentation and components, players are laying rugs on the game board to claim the most number of spaces. On each turn, they select a direction, roll a die to move Assam a number of spaces, lay down a rug next to Assam's new location. If they landed on an opponent's rug, they have to pay "rent" based on the size of the opponent's contiguous carpet. Super simple, but the area control is pretty significant. The rug "tiles" are extremely eye-catching, but I love the simplicity of the game. Players whose only gaming familiarity is with Monopoly would still manage to pick up the game quickly.

RATING: 6.5
The components are excelent, the cover, by the artist from Dixit, is one of the best I've seen. Just the graphic design makes me want to own Marrakech! 

The game mechanic is totally abstract, but the great work the designers have done with Marrakech makes you look beyond that and even believe you're actually placing carperts.

It has almost zero strategy and the tactic content is quite basic as well. Usually, you just choose the best move considering the immediate consequences and nothing else. A bit more thoughts -if at all- can be devoted to where you place the carpets.

But still, the game is fun to play, probably in part because of its striking visuals, but also because it's fast, fluid and lasts no more than 30 minutes. The dice rolls provide the tension and the extra specie every game needs.

I have not yet gotten to that point, but I guess Marrakech will eventually become boring after some plays, because of the lack of depth.

Family game that younger players will find very entertaining, and older players will find relatively easy but very nasty (YES!). While the game is far from complex (it takes less than two minutes to explain everything), repeated plays don't necessarily make it  tedious - coins weigh a bit more in the end than rugs, but leaving the odd rug alone on a corner and "forcing" the pawn to move to other parts of the board can bring a win.

The materials are in a class of their own.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is an excellent family/children's game [i](my younger daughter is 6 and didn't have any problems playing)[/i]. The component quality of the newest edition is top notch, both of my girls want copies of the game just so they can have the rugs to play with. The rules take up half a page, you can teach the game in a couple of minutes. Game play has an interesting tile laying mechanic where it is possible to overlap your rugs on top of someone else's meaning there is a lot of player interaction and screw-age possible. At first the game may seem a bit random, but as the board gets filled with rugs you can plan ahead and leave someone with a bunch of sub par choices to choose from on their turn.

I'm not sure where I heard about Marrakech, but I'm glad a took a flier on it. This is a next step game for my youngest daughter [i](she's 6, almost 7)[/i] since she no longer wants to play a lot of the children's games we have. I also think this would be a fun, quick game to break out to begin or end a game night.[/i]

This is a dumb little game where you have a grid and a single meeple. You roll a die and move the meeple however many spaces, then place a carpet. If you stop on a carpet of someone else's color, you pay them points equal to the number of contiguous spaces that color carpet covers. Then you place a carpet of your own. Each carpet is actually a nice piece of colored felt, and you can lay it anywhere so long as it doesn't cover both halves of a previously played carpet. 
The gameplay didn't have a ton in terms of decisions, but I can't help but be charmed when we are moving around actually carpeting up the board with real cloth bits.

I like the combination of theme to bits - the use of actual bits of cloth for a rug sales is greate. It handles the stacking mechanism used in the game very well.

It is a simple game. Mostly an attempt to control area by having your rugs "on top", and risk management where you try to avoid to pay too many coins. While you can change the direction of movement a die roll determines the movement (like the use of slippers to indicate the spaces moved (1-4).

This game is quick and easy to learn, and that is the end of the good points.
The layered carpets are a clever idea but fabric is fiddly as hell to deal with on the board. And the game-play really isn't worth trying. You only really control the play of the player on your left and the end result of their move is the result almost entirely of a dice roll, while the scoring system has a massive central trend largely neutralizing what small tactical advantages your play can eke out. Worse, every decision you make in the game is a negative one about harming other players.
Imagine that you revised snakes and ladders, but the only decision you added was which snake you pushed the player on your left down.

Fun filler game.  A stark mix of pure strategy (in the decisions of which way to face Assam and where to lay one's carpets) and die-rolling luck (in how far Assam moves).

The carpet-laying mechanic is nice, and the little carpets made of actual cloth are cute, as well as being a good clever solution to the mechanical problem of stacking carpets partially covering other carpets, so that the two halves of carpets are often at various heights.  (The game would not work well physically with traditional rigid tiles instead of soft flexible cloth.)

Thumbs down for them doing the penny-wise pound-foolish thing of giving 15 carpets in 3 colors and only 12 in the 4th color, so that when playing with 3 colors, no player can choose that 4th color.

After 4 plays, with 2 players and 4 players, it seems the luck factor is too high for me to really take the game seriously, but it is a fun filler game.  First played a couple times 2008-06-05, then twice more at Pionek 2008-06-08.

Family game that uses the same main system than Pueblo and Rumis, that is to score points for things that can be seen from above, this time tiny carpets. Points are also given when someone lands in your carpets, depending on the area that they are covering. The bits are amazing, especially Assam and the carpets.

Marrakech --

One interesting element is that the game worked because of the materials used.  Using fabric for the carpets not only suited the theme, it made the layering feasible.

I thought this might be too childish, but found it quite fun.

RATING: 5.5
What an original take on roll and move! The game could be described as a sorta kinda monopoly distilled - you roll a die, you create properties (areas of rugs) and you pay if you land on somebody else's property (rug empire). 

There's some area control/tile laying, there's some odds management (figuring where you'd land as you can get bankrupt). Looks very simple, has a bit of mirage of depth, but all in all a nice middle ground between both in a type of shorter Monopoly surrogate. Neat.

From Spirit Games.

Nice little abstract, almost area control game. Roll the die and move Assam in any direction, then lay your cool 2 by 1 rug. 

You're also trying not to land Assam on your opponents rug, other wise you will have to pay coins for that privilege. The cost is dependent on the size of that particular coloured area. whilst also thinking about positioning Assam so it increased that probability of opponents landing on your colour in their turn.

Winner on the player with combination of most coins and rugs of their colour in view.

Plays great with 2, and also with 4. This will get to the table often I feel.

Wifey approved.

A szőnyegkereskedő, aki a játéktábla közepén kezdi a játék közbeni túráját a játékosok körükben először a három irány közül valamelyik felé állítják (hátraarc nem lehetséges), majd dobnak a lépéskockával, amin 1-től 4-ig van lépésszám. Utána megteszik a lépést, majd a 2 helyet foglaló szőnyegeikből egyet feltesznek a táblára élszomszédosan a kereskedővel. Ha ellenfél szőnyegére érünk a kereskedővel annyit fizetünk játékostársunknak, amennyi egybefüggő szönyegterületére léptünk. A játék az összes szőnyeg letevésééig folytatódik. Gyönyörű a játék kivitele és alapból az ötlet is tetszik, de a kockával való lépés teljesen szerencsejátékká teszi a társast. Ezt, ha jobban kitalálják sokkal jobb játék lehetett volna.

RATING: 6
A simple enough game with unique components (the rugs are made out of actual fabric) and the "pay if you end up on someone else's rug" is reminiscent of Monopoly but I am not a big fan of the "tiles on top at the end of the game" mechanic. Lots of rolling the dice ensures that the whole affair ends up being quite random, so it doesn't really matter, how well you play or how experienced you are. Other similar games that come to mind are "Manhattan" and "Rumis / Blokus", but I didn't like those much either.

RATING: 6
This has amazing bits.  This is one the coolest looking games I've played.  That said, I'm not sure how much game is there.  I think that this is an excellent game to play with your kids, but with adults I'm not so sure.  There are some decisions to be made that are ultimately determining whether you win or not, but more times than not you are just wandering around based on where the die takes you.

Most of the game is just hoping to get to a good spot to cover up your opponent's rugs, and not having to cover your own, so moving to territory where you are barely in seems the most profitable route.  Meanwhile, you hope that other people land on your rugs and don't cover them up.

Great little filler. On first glance at the rules, it seems like this is an uninteresting roll-and-move, but the rug placement really adds some strategic depth. Highly recommend the variant, as I think it makes the game more calculating and nasty.

Good mix of probability management, tile-laying, and area control. The decisions aren't all that difficult, but I like the game anyway. There's something about laying strips of fabric on a board that's just plain satisfying. If nothing else, it's unique.

A pretty simple roll-and-move game with nice little carpet-dominos. Has some strategy but plays pretty quickly. Too light to every rate highly, but a nice little filler.

--- Summary ---
Everyone starts with 10coins and the same number of carpets. On your turn, you may rotate Omar 90degrees. Then roll die and move him forward as many spaces as showing (d6: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4); if gets to edge of board, follow curve and continue moving in now row. If he lands on another player's carpet, pay that player 1 coin per square showing that is contiguous with the landed-on square. Then, place your carpet orthogonally adjacent to Omar (but may not directly overlay another carpet).

Game ends when all players have played all carpets. Each gets 1 coin per visible square. Player with most coins wins!

The game is worth for its beautiful components because in what gameplay respects it's not a good game. It has luck and randomness all over it and it's a bit dull actually. I like to think that players do actually decide something and that making some moves is better than others but I'm afraid it's just me being nice to this gorgeous game because it's pure randomness. Still something good enough for the eyes and it plays quickly.

One of those games that, despite the die, is almost entirely determined by how much people want to be a dick to you.

Whilst that's not always a bad thing, it didn't really capture me.

My opinion, along with much of the table was a resounding "Meh." Though a happy one rather than a dismissive one.

Az első partihoz képest egy picit több taktikai lehetőséget fedeztem fel benne. 

Bár meg kell hagyni, hogy egyáltalán nem az a kemény stratégiai játék, de azért egy nagyobb parti után agypihentetőként elő lehet venni.
A játékosok végső pontszámai általában közel vannak egymáshoz, és bár kicsit lehet taktikázni benne, de tulajdonképpen a kocka dönti el, hogy ki nyer.

A játék kivitele szép.

This has great bits, plays quickly and has some innovative design elements. And yet ... I found it a little dull and I don't particularly feel the desire to play it again, let along buy it. I would imagine some people will find this cute, colorful and simple game hits a sweet spot, but there just wasn't enough going on to hold my interest for long. I'm also not a huge fan of games that focus on bash-the-leader mechanics, and this one has that element in spades.

If you just read the rules from this game, you might get the idea that the point of the game is to force your opponents to land on rugs of your type, but you would likely be mistaken.  That aspect of the game is minor compared to the points you get from leaving your color uncovered at the end of the game, and the Shopkeeper is there to balance out the fact that you want to go into someone else's region to take some of those points away from them.  This is a game of placement, and is somewhat reminiscent of a Colovini game.  I think fans of his games would enjoy this one, as it is a little abstract.  The game definitely gets points for the carpet playing pieces, too.

The 2-player rules are nice, in that players take two different carpet colors and shuffle them into a stack that must be used in order.  It can create some interesting moments in the game, where you're trying to lead an opponent toward a region of your color, but then you wind up covering up the space with a different color.  I think the game could possibly improve with the rule that your lowest-showing color of the two is the only one that contributes to your final score, but that's just thinking out loud.  As it is, it's still a decent game.

Cute family game, very thematic using carpets made of real cloth. The big Assam/Omar figure is also nice as well as the big die. Mechanics are quite simple, sometimes we would like to have a bit more nastiness in the game. One funny variant is to first roll the die and move Assam/Omar and turn him at the END of each players' move. Makes the game a bit more tactical and may trigger more payoffs. But for a family game it is good as it is because you usually do not want that kind of nastiness in a game of this kind. Replayability is not enormously high, but it is good to keep in your shelf for a quick play now and then, especially when you want to show non-gamers a more creative and unique idea of a board game. Recommended if you like the theme or want something nice and light.

After 1 Play: While this game seems to be very light on strategy, I think there is more than is first apparent.

After 2+ Plays: Definitely an interesting game.  Your first thought is to try to combine all your carpets into one blob for the big payoff, but this strategy is doomed to failure, as people will always choose to face the other way.  The goal seems to be to make spots big enough for a decent payout, but not too big.

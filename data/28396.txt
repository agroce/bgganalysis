Rating after one game.  It was a bit disjointed as none of us had played it before, and I think the rating may improve with more plays.
It was a fun theme, but seemed quite random.
Seemed like a very obvious basic strategy was to do an auction and bid 1 less than the cost - which almost always got you the item cheaper.

I think the advanced rules are a must. I think that a four player game using advanced rules is optimal for this one... I'd like to play it a few more times with that setup before I make a judgment. This could be a good filler game with a bit of thought to it!

A lightish bidding game with a colourful theme.  It's quite quick to play and easy to grasp.  It's competing in quite a crowded market so the theme is what really carries this and will make a lot of folks want to buy it.

Extremely strong game - the ~15 minute length means it is really easy to get to the table, and everyone enjoys the theme. I'm using it as an alternative to Hey, that's my fish! and other short games that we can start playing straight away without the customary 1/2 hour discussion about what to play.
Well worth picking up.

Schnelles Spiel mit wirklich schönem Thema und einem simplen, aber sehr spannenden Bietmechanismus. Besonders die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten, mit einer Karte umzugehen -> Ins "Loch", Direktkauf o. Versteigern machen das Spiel sehr interessant.
Und wie gesagt: Körperteilhandel, um ein Frankensteins Monster zu bauen ist einfach ein tolles Thema! :-)

Great theme! This is a very fast playing auction/set collection game. The components are very nice and absolutely drive the theme (I think the screen with the Mad Scientist Labratory on the inner side is brillant!) I look forward to playing this more often. The best part is being the first to yell "It's Alive!" is actually in the rulebook.

I really wanted to like this game, but honestly, it's one step shy of being LCR.

Essentially, the game goes something like this:
draw a card (or pay to get one off a pile)

buy it, sell it (for half cost) or auction it to try and get it cheap or raise money.

We spent most of the time just trying to draw the pieces we needed and buying them outright.

I'm trying to figure out where the fun in the game was.

This light auction game of set-collecting has been dug up and given a new lease of life, with a "fresh" theme stitched on. Spot on graphics have made it a real looker too. The game itself is a top-notch hand-made production that, judging by the publisher's geeklist stories, is so elaborate and time-consuming to produce and assemble, and done with so much love and dedication, that I have visions of a mad game producer's workshed, not unlike the scientist's lab graphics on the inside of the screens, with naked electricity sparking off machines that go "ping", whilst the mad man himself shouts in triumph over rain and thunder to celebrate the completion of each numbered copy that rolls of the assembly slab, only taking rest breaks when Igor serving tea, at 4 (it is the UK cottage industry after all). I've got the original, more serene, Menorah version too, but guess which one gets more table time? The Frankenstein monster theme is a stroke of (mad) genius.

The original game was already enjoyable, but a loving eye for theme and detail has lifted this game well above a set of decent mechanisms. For the right occasion, it is a fun filler, and with the right people, quick playing too.

The main problem with auction games in which the yield from each auction gets paid to a player is, normally, that bad bidding by one player can be so profitable to another that it skews the game. By having a clear value on each tile that comes up for auction, that problem is neatly sidestepped. One other common problem however has been left in: the player who randomly flips the most valuable cards for auction has a marked advantage over a player who reveals the less sought after body parts, as the maximum potential income will be much more substantial. It doesn't ruin the game, but it does pin its strategic offerings firmly within a less ambitious range for me.

The option to bypass the random draw and hand-pick and re-introduce an exposed part from a discard pile instead is great in theory, but usually prohibitively expensive. But a skilful bidder will have plenty of chances to pitch bids that will give other players some genuine headaches, and there is always the chance that the villagers will rise up just when you were planning to open the roof and shout at the heavens, thinking victory was in the bag. Mobs have a habit of knocking at your door when they are the least welcome.

The advanced rules are a must, and what you get is a persuasive filler. Maybe a bit long with a full set of players, when cash is also at a premium, as your earning turns are a bit slower to arrive. The mechanics are solid enough, but it is the theme that sells it, and kudos for spotting one that suits the original design even better, and getting a great graphic designer on board for the illustrations. It's the combinations of these ingredients that bring it all alive, and it certainly is alive and well. It is also only the second release by a new fledgling company, but if the first two are an indication of the standard and apparent enthusiasm that we can expect, then I can't wait for the catalogue to flesh out fast.

Horror-themed games pretty much turn me off from the get-go.  But, thanks to a great friend teaching me this game, I found that It's Alive rises above other games I've played in this genre.  Maybe it's the almost silly presentation of things, or maybe it's just the really strong mechanisms involved.  I don't know, but I find myself having a great time playing this game.  And, surprisingly, my family has just as much fun playing as I do.  My biggest complaint, before I go any further, is that the advertised play time seems way too low.  Our games clock in at about twice what it says on the box.

The choices are quite simple (Buy, Sell, or Auction) but the strategy is deeper than that.  I also like the fact that you can pay to dig a card out of an opponent's discard pile, so even if they sell off an item you would have bid on, you can still ressurect it.  I am a bit annoyed by the super-thin cardstock of the cards, because it makes shuffling quite difficult.  So now we just make a messy pile in the middle, and as a bonus it feels a bit more like digging up body parts.  We also always play the "advanced" game, which is really not any more difficult than the basic game.  This game is lots of fun, and I highly recommend it.

Thank You to my 2010 BGG Secret Santa!!

A pretty simple auction game that does give players a fair amount of choice, but there does not seem to be a lot of variation in the choices people actually make.  Still, with at least 4 people it seems like there is enough opportunity for players to manipulate the cadaver market and make things interesting.  It plays very fast (15-20 minutes) making for a decent filler game.

A very nice short game. There is luck but also plenty of choices for the players. I liked that I could choose what to do with the tile I draw: sell, auction, or buy. And all games get so much better if they have bodyparts in them. :)

RATING: 6.9
An OK auction/set collection game but rather limited by the randomness of waiting for the one or two parts you want to appear from the deck.

After the first couple of plays I thought there was quite a lot of depth to this one, but I don't think there is now.

Perhaps I am being too harsh - I guess if I considered this as a filler I would mark it rather higher.

Neat auction game, neat theme.  It took us a bit to get through the rules.  Not sure if the rules were muddy or it was us that was muddy.  But we got through them and found it to be a cool game.  This will make the rotation of easy auction games to play (join in with For Sale, Felix, High Society).

RATING: 4.5
Set collection game with a large amount of luck.  It was okay, but there were very few real choices on a turn.  It is also a memory game since you want to remember which body parts people still need... and the game ends when someone has collected one of each of the 8 body parts.  The tiny, square cards are impossible to shuffle like playing cards so you have to deal them out in piles to shuffle them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun filler type game, with hardly any rules to learn. You have 8 body parts to collect, first one to get all 8 yells out "it's alive" and scoring starts. Your "mad scientists lab slab" and your cash is hidden behind a little screen.

Turn up a tile and you have 3 choices - buy it yourself, sell it to your graveyard for half value or auction it off (to yourself or someone else).

Coffins as jokers and rampaging mobs of villagers (neat frankenstein touch!) round off the game as positive and negative effects respectively. 

Fun and fast.

Quick little filler - mechanics would be suitable to play with my kids, but alas the art means the theme isn't. With a more cartoon look (think Scooby Doo) then it would have been okay.

As a game for 12 , okay as a filler, not sure if I like it 2 player, then it is just a memory game. If you want a quick auction game it's worth a try - I certainly liked it enough to buy a copy

RATING: 5
OK auction game.  It works, but isn't that exciting to play.  The random card draw is too strong of an influence for my taste.  If one player draws the majority of high numbered cards they're likely to win because they can sell them for more money (which is perfect if they already have that part because it makes it really expensive for someone else to get it out of the graveyard) or auction them off...again for more than the lower value tiles go for.  Buying from the graveyard is almost never done because it is so expensive.  Peasant revolts add a random screw factor that I don't care for.  The game might work better with fewer players who take the time to remember what everyone else is trying to get so that there is more blocking.  With 5 players it ends up being less tactical and more just random luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting auction game.  Players get to make some good decisions.  Unfortunately, the luck of the card draw dictates the outcome too much.

RATING: 6
I generally enjoy bidding games. I enjoy them more when the winning criteria is clear and not some jumbled mess of majority and 1/4 of the count of X, added to Y...  

This is a fun, easy, and engaging bidding game. Long enough to be tense, but short enough not to drag. Nice.

Feb-09: I just taught this game to my wife and my 12 yr. old son. They kept wanting to play this again to the tune of eight straight games!

Apr-09: I've now played this game 23 times and have taught it to quite a few different people (many non-gamers). All of them enjoy it quite a bit, most ask to play it again immediately, and two have already gone out and purchased copies for themselves.

RATING: 5
Seems like some good ideas here, but ultimately I'm not 100% sure that the advanced rules works in a way that offers many meaningful decisions.  It really seems like the auction action is nearly always the best option.  If I draw a tile worth "7", I can put it up for bids for something like "4".  If I win, I just made 3 points.  If someone else bids "5", I make 5 points and they make 2.  I guess it depends on whether it's a tile I already had or not, but it's just one of those no-brainer decisions for many tile draws.  To top it off, it seems like the villager tiles were just added in to force in a reason for someone to potentially pull something from a graveyard once in a while.  It seems like a rough patch over a problem with one of the main game mechanisms.  In the end, it's still a decent game, although perhaps fundamentally flawed in the advanced game (I can actually see the basic game working much better) and with the best decisions being just a bit too obvious to make it anything too interesting.

Nice little game of making your very own Monster to bring to life. Buy and auction different parts of the monster until one player completes the 8 pieces required. 1 Play.

RATING: 6
Hiding the money and the bodies means you either memorize what everyone has, which I find tedious and dull, or that you buy sometimes when you should auction and the game ends, unless you win, abruptly. I can't help but feel this would be more fun with everything out in the open. Much tighter I imagine. I find it difficult to invest in the outcome of the game when I don't know where I stand.

The turns start to feel a little repetitive if players focus on buying and selling as opposed to auctioning (which I think is what all that hidden information encourages). People, not knowing where they stand, choose to go the safe route as opposed to the risky route.

If I'm going to play an incremental auction game where different people want different things with a player range between two and five, I'll play Ra.

One play - Nice filler with interesting financial decisions (sell at auction to your opponent, sell at half price to the graveyard our buy outright at retail?).  And the morbid theme makes it even a little bit more fun.  The angry villagers tile seems like it should be unbalanced, yet the player who won our game had drawn two back to back so go figure.

This is another game where I appreciate the art and the theme but it just didn't click with me.  Some of the rules felt illogical, and there's certainly a lot of luck in drawing the right tile at the right time.  If only my monster had a head!

But for a game this short, it's hard to be too critical.  If you're having fun you can play it again immediately, and if you're not - move on.

A single game so it's early days and that was only a 2-player. Like the artwork which is nice & atmospheric & reminds me of 2000AD in the 80's. Game moved along nicely in the early stages as we explored the options but it dragged ever so slightly as we both flipped a succession of cards looking for the ones we needed to finish. My wife enjoyed it so that's a plus.

I found this game to be quite a bit of fun. I'd recommend playing the advanced game, as there is more strategy.

Also, playing with the correct rules makes the play all that more better.

I've only played on the iPhone and I really enjoy it. I like auction style games and this presents some good choices to make as well. 
"Should you sell a body part for less money to keep it from your neighbors hand? Or should you auction it and potentially get double?"

The basic and advanced rules make it seem like the perfect gateway game too!

Recently purchased the game and have successfully introduced it to a few gamers and they all enjoyed it.

It's an excellent idea and a highly thematic game. Unfortunately, there is not really much to do - it nearly always pays to auction every tile, so the game is in essence just one auction after another, and therefore this game rather quickly overstays its welcome. A shame really, because the potential seems to be there for a much better game.

I played this with the publisher, Jackson Pope, a close personal friend and a friend of Beyond Monopoly!, York's friendliest boardgame club. It's very nicely made, lovely gruesome graphics and the mechanism has something, but it didn't quite set me on fire. The money goes round well enough, but there isn't much player interaction, and the decisions seemed based more on chance than planning. The cost of buying stuff out of other player's graveyards is too high and that aspect hardly came into play. I'd like to try it again before deciding. *** Played it again with Jackson and Jackson won comfortably. I noticed that he never bought at full price and after he explained that you should not buy on your turn. I'm still not sold on it myself, but don't let me put you off. I'm not a money gamer, I don't excell at bidding.

2-5, 30 mins., auction, set collec.
The graphics are fun and kids love the theme, which is cute.  Rules are short and easy and the game is light, but there is enough strategy in the game with decisions on whether to buy, sell, auction, or ransom, to satisfy me.  The luck is quite heavy, however.  There are 6 Villager's uprsing cards in the deck and I drew all 6 in my first two games (each were 5-player games)--impossible bad luck & impossible to win--but did finally in the 4th game when I didn't draw any.  Card counters will love this game.

As for ages, the box says 12+.  This must be for content and not ability to play which I put at 8+.  I don't see a problem with the theme that is tongue in cheek, and the graphics cartooney.  (Good grief, if you read some of the old German fairy tales read as bedtime stories, they are down right sadistic and threatening.)

The game is very poorly punched.  It was evident immediately so I was very patient and punched as carefully as possible, yet 4 still ripped and had to be repaired.  On many of the other chips I had to file off the rough paper edges.  I find it distressing to have a game look so ratty before it is even played once.  Furthermore the cards are LESS than 2" square.  The deck of 60 is supposed to be shuffled!  On the first try I bent 2 of these flimsy, way undersized cards.

I am disappointed in the shabby quality especially since this game particularly appeals to kids, and therefore should be sturdier.  Box is small & doesn't take up much space on the shelf.  Since the game is short in duration, I found it a little addictive.  When playing with older children and adults, we use the advanced scoring.  Perfect Halloween game.

Subtle play is requisite; the system of auction and the underlying economics are similar to Goa or elements of Modern Art. The importance of making the right decision to either sell, buy or auction is totally dependent on remembering which player is after which part.  It's a good game but I'm not sure we would be able to play out one round per player when there are more involved games to play; best used as an opener or closer; a little too long for a filler.

It's Alive plays well and has a good design to keep you interested with multiple plays.  The tension level of the game is increased by the slabs being hidden.

It's Alive makes a great addition to any game collection for a quick and fun set collector filled with a few tense choices and a "monstrous" theme.

This is a really nice filler/quick game. It does however seem to play a lot better with more players. Playing with just 2 people was kind of dull. I had a lot of fun with this. There can be some tough decions at times, but nothing bad enough to effect the down time of players. The game went smoothly and played quickly.

Pay or Bid for tiles to complete your Zombie, Sell those you don't want to the Bank and try to complete your Zombie before anyone else does to be able to shout "It's Alive!!".

Nice art, better than average game. Auction mechanic doesn't do much for the atmosphere, and unless the players are hamming it up this is merely an interesting commerce game.

Another excellent, self-published game from Reiver Games. 

Quick and easy to learn. Light enough to be a gateway auction game, but with some interesting tactical decisions. Having values on the cards makes it much easier to evaluate how much they are worth (which can be a problem for many auction games IMO). Really fits the theme nicely, and the excellent artwork helps with that too. 

Rating after 9 plays (1x 4player and 8x 3player).

RATING: 4
Caveat: I don't like horror-based games. So, I wasn't particularly enthused to play this one. We played a 5P game, all newbies. Object: collecting various body parts, displayed on various cards with various values, to be the first to create your "Frankenstein". Highest summed value of all body parts wins the game. Mechanics are pretty simple: pick a card from the deck, then 1) Buy it at the value listed, 2) Auction it, or 3) Bury it in your graveyard and get half its value in income. This is an interesting auction game, similar in feel to Modern Art, where the auction is always a "once around", but that the active player is first in making the bid, not last. This is a crucial difference, since if you bid too high, in hopes of having someone else outbid you and giving you the money, you may get stuck buying the card. If the card is something you want, you probably want to buy it outright. However, you must sometimes risk losing a body part you want in order to auction it off for income. If you luck out, like I did, you can bury valuable body parts in your graveyard, and pocket half its value. This makes is harder for other players to get the body part. They can still get it, by paying for the full price, and then either buying it for themselves, or auctioning it off for a possible profit. The game seems dependent on luck, and it is possible for a player to get screwed by picking up the "mob with pitchforks" card, which is sort of like a penalty. One player was considerably set-back, when she drew three of these cards in succession over two turns. I'm sure there is a game in here, and there seems to be depth of tactical play, so it looks worth pursuing further. The game somewhat drips with theme, with grotesque body part graphics on the cards. The player aids describing the card distributions is utterly worthless, as it was confusing. I can take it or leave it, but will not go out of my way to get this nor suggest that it come back to the table anytime soon.

Update (01/20/12): Initial rating was a '7', but being away from it for 18 months hasn't made me miss this title. It's a '4'.

Another hat off to Reiver Games. It's Alive is interesting and original amidst the gazillion games being produced every year. I really liked the fact that it is a short game with very good components and design, and I like the gameplay. I need to play more to get a real feel of it but my first impressions are mostly good. My only issue (a small one) is perhaps the complexity of the game that could have been streamlined a bit, but I'm guessing it is like so for balance reasons.

This suffered from the "Best Game Ever" syndrome (I enjoyed it more because I won my first game).  Still, it's a fun little game of building monsters.  First play anecdote: The first time I played it, it was with a component-only copy that was stuffed into a big plastic toolbox full of different (mostly euro) games.  As a result, I didn't see the game box or the name.  Partway through the game, I said, "I bet the title has at least one exclamation point."  Of course it does.

The most interesting mechanic is in choosing what comes up for auction.  Players can put a random card to buy, sell or auction, or they can pay to remove something from the graveyard and then pay to buy, sell or auction.  While this seems strange, it is well incorporated into the game.

RATING: 6
A light economic game with a Dr. Frankenstein theme. Now THIS is a good beer and pretzels game for the gamer crowd. It plays quick. The decisions are light, but hold your interest. The artwork and theme are fun. On each turn, the player selects a card by drawing one or buying one off of one of the players' graveyards, then they either buy it themselves, sell it for a bit of cash, or put it up for auction in the hopes of getting it cheap or getting more cash than by simply selling it. Players need to collect 8 different cards to complete their monsters and when that happens, the player with the most points wins. There's a basic version as well easier for kids.

Edit in 2016: ended up not playing this much over the years. There is an issue that, although everything is behind a screen, everyone knows what goes there, so players with a better memory have a big advantage. Leaving everything, open however would make the game too calculable. Still an okay game, but downgraded a point and traded.

I really liked this game.
The game is very easy to explain and plays very quick. Played only two two player games. I feel that the luck of the draw and memory skills are of a greater factor when playing with two. I can see bluffing,good use of the one round auction being a bigger influence when you play with more.
I really liked the artwork and am truly impressed with the production quality of the game.(got the first edition)
The advanced game where you count the points is really good.
We decided that the winner would be the one who yelled it's alive first would win the game, but just out of curiosity we counted the points also. In one game the winner of the basic game, lost the advanced game.

I am sure I will suggest this a couple of times, if I continue to suggest it I will upgrade my initial rating.

Enjoyable, quick playing filler in which you are creating Frankenstein.  On your turn, you are generally deciding if you want to sell a tile for half value, auction it, or buy it for face value.  There is another option where you can pull stuff out of graveyards and then put it up for one of those three options.  Watch out for the angry villagers!

Giochino dall'ambientazione simpatica. E' semplice e dalla durata contenuta. Penso che un paio di regolette vadano riviste e adattate, specie quella di poter comprare 2 volte una carta scartata da un avversario… Il gioco è comunque reperibile su siti on-line tedeschi a pochi €uro.

I love this game's style and mechanics.  Fun, clever, and unique.  Simplistic, yet a little challenging.  The auctioning is strategic and cool once you understand the rules fully.  I would've given a ten if it weren't for the gory theme and body pieces, and the directions needing reading many times over to answer the questions that initially crop up from players.  Kids enjoy the game, but the content is not for kids unless they like horror and gore.  Can play a simpler varation for people that aren't ready for "digging" into more strategy.

Nice and simple bidding game with a dark humor theme. You build your own Frankenstein buying body parts from ill repute people. It is all about bidding right and keeping track of the body parts played to know your chances of winning. Sometimes being the first to the end is not good, and you may have to wait because other players have better points than you. Nice little game, plays very quickly and makes a good filler or intro game.

Lovely production values on this neat little game.
Buy, auction, or raid the graveyards for the body parts needed to create your Frankenstein monster.
Running out of money? Sell unwanted parts for half their value, or reap the reward when someone else buys the auctioned body part that you started off.
Just watch out for the villagers uprising! - such a reactionary crowd!!!

Fun little auction game where the key is to try and get the highest value body parts for the lowest price to build your creature.  I liked the choice where you could auction off a body part and get it for less than face value if the other players weren't willing to pay the full face value, in which case you still got paid more than you would have had you sold the body part (you only get 1/2 rounded down.)  There is a choice you can make to pull a body part out of someone's graveyard but it wasn't used in our game.  Maybe that would occur if we played it more.

A 3-5 player auction/set-collection game. The theme and artwork are excellent, and the component quality is top-notch for a card game. It's Alive! has more theme and fun than Modern Art, but it trades in the skillful valuations and implicit player alliances of Modern Art for the much less interesting strategy of memory. Memory of who bought what, and memory of who is low on money.

The publisher really missed the boat in terms of manufacturing interesting bits for the game, and making each body part look different, so that every reanimated corpse will look unique.

RATING: 7
Can't belive that this game went from a religious theme to one about Frankensteins. Oh the irony.

In any case, it's not a bad little filler. Players are trying to create a frankenstein by acquiring 8 body parts.

Players choose a tile to auction each turn (either from a central stack or from the top of any players graveyard stack...the latter needs to be paid for). The player then either auctions it, buys it and pays value to bank or puts it in the graveyard and gets half its value.

First to complete their monster wins. In the advanced game, the player with the most value on tiles wins.

Some interesting elements as the auctioneer gets a final bid on item. Also, cards acquired can be used to bring cards from graveyard into the middle to the table (a little roundabout).

A quick filler game where you try and build a monster. Tremendous amount of luck involved as everything depended on what was drawn from the central stack. It was super-light though and easy to learn or teach. I somehow wish there was more variety in the parts, like the parts came together to make unique monsters or something, as after a while the theme takes a back seat to the numbers and the missing tiles you need to find.

RATING: 6
It started out interesting, but then it got repetitive as it went on too long.  There were 5 players, and that may be too many players for this, as you have to make your money last longer before another "payday". It took us about 45 minutes. Another problem is similar to the issue with Industria - if your tile flip is a low-valued tile, then you can't make much money off of it.  There's no other way to make money, so a player that flips a "2" who doesn't need that part is going to either sell it to the bank for 1 or auction it off, making 3 or 4.  A player who flips a 10-point wildcard will be able to make much more.

Next time, I'll play with a tweak where you take out the wild cards and give them out to players (but make their values not count at the end).  This will both speed up the game and remove the advantage of being the one to flip this high-valued cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's pretty simple: each player is trying to construct the most valuable monster using body part tiles. The tiles, with different ranges of point values for each part, are shuffled into a face down stack. Players start with some money and a monster creation board (slab) hidden behind a screen. On your turn, first choose a tile: either flip the top tile in that stack for free, or choose the top (face up) card in someone's graveyard by paying the value of that card (in coins and/or previously saved body parts). If you flip one of the few (4?) Village Riot cards, must discard the appropriate value of body parts to your graveyard, keep the card (for its point value), then draw again. After selecting a tile, either buy it and add it to your slab (pay in coins), discard it to your personal graveyard (earn half its value in coins, rounding down), or auction it off (for coins, once around, you bid first; if you win, pay bank; if another wins, they pay you). The game ends when someone finishes their monster. VP = (value of body parts on slab) + (coins), but coins may contribute no more than half your total VP. Most VP wins.

1 game, 5er: The overall reception was ... meh. It's a decent set collection game, and it works pretty well. It just wasn't all that exciting. I would like to play it at least once more, but I doubt it will be a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A pretty uninteresting "lucky draw" card game.  The game is played by drawing the top card depicting a body part off a deck (or paying extra to draw from a player's discard pile) and buying, selling, or auctioning off that card in order to make the most valuable monster out of 8 different body parts.

The buy for full price, sell for half price, or auction (in an attempt to get more than you would by selling or buy for cheaper than you would by buying) decision tree is mildly interesting but that's about where the appeal of this game ends.

Probably not bad as a kids game for introducing young ones to the basic concepts of economic and auction games.

BestWith:4,3_not_5. Great for Halloween. Box size smaller than I expected. Variant: A player with a Villager tile behind their screen is not affected by a new one they draw. Just draw until a non-Villager appears and shuffle them back into the stack. Keep for cool player screens.

It's Alive plays quickly and the theme is kinda neat. The main problem here is lack of balance. Players lucky enough to draw high-numbered cards will make more money and score more points than players unlucky enough to draw low-numbered cards every time. With no mechanism to correct this flaw, the game is hardly worth playing - you might just as well cut for high card with a regular deck of cards.

It is the turn of the nineteenth century, and mad scientists throughout Europe are competing for the infamy of being the first to create life through the power of alchemy. Using only the raw materials provided by some dubious 'Suppliers to the Anatomical Trade,' harnessed lightning, and the services of a motley crew of unattractive servants, you race to collect the eight body parts needed to create your monster and bring it to life. Unfortunately, the local peasants are particularly clumsy and tend to die in freak farming accidents, so the dubious gentlemen rarely find a whole cadaver in sufficiently good condition. Instead, they offer the parts they have managed to salvage. Each turn, you may buy the offered part, sell it to an anatomist for a meager profit, or auction it, trying to get a better deal or rip off your opponents. You might be lucky and get a coffin with a weakling clerk's cadaver in it, which can be used in lieu of any strapping villager's body part, or your involvement in the macabre trade might invoke the villagers' wrath.

The unusual theme mixed with a quick playing time makes this an easy game to get to the table. Players who normally don't like auction games in which one must bid correctly every time or lose will enjoy this one as it has a lighter feel. Still, even though the game is short and it has a fluffier taste, It's Alive still offers enough strategic choices to appeal to strategy gamers. And the thrill of shouting, "It's alive!" adds several points in and of itself. See my review for more details...

This is a rather peculiar set collection game.  Players turn over a card, and can either pay for it and take it, collect half its value and discard it to an open pool, or have a once-round auction, where, predictably, they pay the bank if they win, or get paid if they lose.  The peculiar thing here is the once-around auction *starts* with the active player rather than ending with them.  It adds a refreshing twist to a mechanism i've seen a hundred places before.

It might not be fair to rate this game strictly off of the iOS version, but it doesn't seem very engaging or interesting.  There's a lot of doing the same thing over and over, with only small incremental advances being made over the course of the round.  The decisions are usually evident -- sell it if you can't afford to buy it, buy it if you can and need it -- and it never seems to be beneficial to buy something from someone else's graveyard, since it will cost twice as much.  It seems better to just wait for what you want, but then you might get hit with the mob, so it just seems rather pointless.  I'd give it a try in person if the opportunity ever arises, but otherwise, I'm just not that interested.

An interesting auction game.  We didn't use the graveyard too much, but I think its use would make the game more interesting if someone decided to hoard specific parts that other players needed.  I don't know how cost effective that would be since money from those auctions would go to the bank since the owner would have been paid when they added the part to their graveyard, but it would definitely make things expensive for the buyers.

Just in time for Halloween!  Or any spooky stormy night!
Playing a mad scientist collecting body parts, this is a cute little game with some auction action, bidding, and card drawing.  
The components are actually very nice for a smaller game company - you even get screens to hide your medical cadaver behind as you build it!

However, I was disappointed with the rules for auctioning your body parts.  You can only bid once on a body part,and this, in my opinion, limits the social interaction that I was looking for.  Next time I play, I'm gonna set it up so that players can bid more than once so that player can employ a defensive bid to jack up a price.  Other than that, a quick 30 min. game that's quite enjoyable.

It's not deep or complex, but it's very quick and very enjoyable for what it is. It's the theme that really makes it, and it's a lot of fun if you "get into character". Gameplay can be a little slow to start with, but it picks up after a few turns.

The "advanced" rules are only slightly different, but much better because you need to balance speed against the value of the parts you're collecting. It's not really worth bothering with the basic rules IMO.

Downgraded from 8 to 7 after 12 plays. I still agree with all my above comments, I'm just not finding it to have huge replayability.

A pure auction game that while plays short, is just way too reptitive.  Strategy seems to revolve in being able to snatch up body parts for the cheapest, either by buying them out right to avoid increasing other players' gold, or getting them in auction at lower than their actual value.  Graveyard seems like a superfluous addition to the game that is only good for burying desirable cards since it is doubly expensive to bring them back into play.  I don't think it's a bad choice for those that enjoy this particular mechanic, but not my cup of tea, so only an average rating from me.

The, translated, rules were a bit unclear, but after watching a video review of this one, everything was clear. Simple game. Plays fast. When a player has bad luck, and draws 3 riot cards in a row, it’s almost impossible to win this game. The auction part works well, even with 2 players. The artwork is great. Quality of the cards and money tokens is good, but the quality of the player screens, could be better. The cardboard of these is minimal. This game will work well, with a party of 4-5 people who are into very light games.

As a gamer who is drawn to games carrying a horror theme, this was a must for my collection.  I purchased it a while back and just had the opportunity to give it a go.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!

I really love the theme and the idea of buying/selling body parts in order to construct your monster is not only fun, but also really draws you in to the auctioning element as it is a true reflection of the overall sentiment.

Although these mechanics can be found in many other games, they work really well together here to provide an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

I love the artwork and all the brightly colored, high-quality components!

Fun auction game, a bit more complex than "for sale" which is great for gamers but may scare the family game crowd... Good stuff though, I like it and it may be my fave  +++ filler game

Ugh, I really didn't like this game. Only two plays but I doubt I will play it again - there's just too many better games around...

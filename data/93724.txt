This game always makes me think of that academy award nominee, "there will be blood". I bought this game as a suggestion from a friend and it proved atypical for a FF game in that it was more of a euro than most of the games they put out with heavier themes and better art. This didn't hurt the game too much though. It is an interesting blend of auction bidding and commodity speculation where you play a oil company trying to find oil wells and then sell the oil at the right time and price. Bidding is key when it comes to determining which oil market to sell your product. Did I mention there are little truck meeples..."truckles"? And oil mines with oil plumes you stick in them depending on how big the well your prospecting truck finds. Good stuff.

Initial impressions: Nice auction game. Players move their truck on the map trying to find oil. Then they trasport the oil to one of the 3 compnanies and then the auction begins to see who will sell his oil. The components are great but the map tiles seem dry and boring. They all seem the same, I would like more details on them. The game flows well but there is a bit more randomness than I would have liked. Its not a very tight game. It took us around 2 hours for a 4 player game.

A game about oil magnates that isn't heavy at all, albeit not devoid of strategy. Unexpectedly engaging, with a couple of unique mechanics. However, after a few plays you inevitably crack the optimal strategy... and it loses majority of its charm.

[ESP] Black Gold es un juego realmente hermoso y con una muy buena aplicación del tema. Sin embargo tiene 2 características que hacen que no esté entre mis predilectos:
1) La subasta por la venta del petroleo - nunca he sido fan de esa mecánica
2) La cantidad de suerte involucrada tanto en los valores de los permisos que se roban como en que haya o no arto petróleo cerca de donde me estoy moviendo.

RATING: 5.5
It's a nice point allocation game, but the fact that you only have 2 ways o speinding your points, while keeping the game somehow "AP free", makes decisions a bit too trivial (and obvious).

This leaves the real core of the game's tough decisions in the card draft and the auction mechanics, both of which are good, but far from original.

The game almost feels like something you've played a lot of times before. This is not a terrible drawback, and I'm willing to give the game another try, as it's a somehow fun game. However, it does take too long or what it is.

This game has such a beautiful narrative to it. I love the prospecting for black gold, I love the WildCat feel with the #2 wells (they are either really great or pretty crappy), and I love building wells in all directions with gushers so tall that they cast shadows upon all that venture near.

I love auctions - this one is sublime with the bluffing mechanism. Whenever I bluff I try so hard to keep my poker face...and why do I feel my heart in my throat - it's just a game! 

I cannot recommend this game enough.

My only complaint is that I do not like the extra auction with 5 players. In my opinion, in makes the game a little too loose. 4 players is the sweet spot here.

[thing=93724][/thing] is an excellent game to use to promote discussion of the oil and gas industry. You take the role of an aspiring oil and gas baron in the Permian Basin of west Texas. The person who acquires the most wealth (or money) will be declared the winner. To earn money you must [b]auction and bid[/b] for the right to sell your oil at one of the available oil markets. Clever [b]commodity speculation [/b] as to when and where to sell your oil, some nerves of steel when bluffing against your opponents, and some [b]press your luck[/b] opportunities will all be required to finish ahead of your fellow oil man.

Your oil exploration is done by driving your truck ([b]grid movement[/b]) around the Permian Basin, which is represented by a  [b]modular board[/b] giving you a different experience every time you play. Your actions are chosen at the beginning of the round in a single [b]card drafting[/b] phase.

Players pick a card that gives them a variable number of bidding cards and movement points.  It may also supply other privileges.  Next, trucks are moved and wells may be built.  Oil is gathered from the wells, then players take turns placing the oil as they wish in three different markets.  These choices are made market by market.  The price fluctuates with a die rolled at the beginning of the round.  The bidding cards are used to bid on selling as much or little of your oil at the price of a particular market.  This is also performed market by market.  Players who advanced furthest in the oil field are awarded additional points for their oil derricks.

Fun little exploration and auction game.  Way easier to play than it looks, it's actually very rules lite.  The auctions are a little long, but didn't seem to drag on too much for our 3 player game.   I like the strategy between winning an auction or waiting for a better position to sell your oil.  Also the balance between moving your train and exploring for more oil is interesting too.

RATING: 8
Black Gold is a fun design coupled with a very nice production.  Each round consists of a series of market fluctuation, action card draft, board movement, investment, and auction, and it all meshes and flows quite well.  The bidding can be especially vicious because winner-take-all situations are common.  Timing of when to go for a big score is critical, because mistakes can be punishing.  Assuming your family can handle that, this is a good family game.

Drawbacks are the game feels like it runs a bit long, largely because the rounds are fairly repetitive.  If I could have only one oil-themed economic game, it would be Crude, but it would be painful to let Black Gold go.  Black Gold also reminds me of Owner's Choice, a lighter game wrapped around a similar market fluctuation mechanism.  

It took some thinking, but for now I believe I will be keeping this game.  Given my tendency to purge a game that does not meet a very standard, that is high praise indeed.  I will be curious to see how this holds up after some more plays, as I can imagine my opinion going either up or down with experience.

This is a game that I picked up on clearance from FFG and let it sit for years unplayed. Now that I have played I am kicking myself for letting it sit this long. Not a super complex game but enough there to make it interesting since there are a few areas of engagement with your opponents. There's the oil field where you compete for the prime well spots; The rail which leaping ahead there forces players to pay you to transport their goods; Then the oil market where the auction makes you want to push your bid if at the very least to drain your opponent's hand so you'll have a good hand later to bid with. Now that I've played it will stick around for a while since I don't have many economic games on my shelves.

Even though I typically avoid all things Fantasy Flight, this one one wasn't so bad. It reminded me of Deadwood (something on the Euro side of the fence, but with a campy theme and easy to approach gameplay).

The spatial element to moving on the board is really a means to an end for what is a commodity auction game. Thankfully everything is oiled and moves quite well. The game is not terribly deep and still very enjoyable to play.

If you find a cheap copy, it is a worth purchase, otherwise playing someone elses copy is great and there is no need to sink dollars on it.

This is a remake of Giganten by Kosmos.  

When I learned Fantasy Flight was republishing I was excited because 1) they made it into a 5-player game, which hits the table far more often 4-player games, and 2) Fantasy Flight has a reputation for going all out on the components.  So I was excited to see the changes.

First of all, the great mechanics are the same--no changes.  This version includes a variant for inexperienced gamers, and another for reducing the randomness when drilling wells.  (Personally, I think the randomness better simulates the oil fields, and would never use the Even Distribution.)

I am so disappointed in the components.  The tiny trucks are 1/3 the size and the oil derricks are smaller too.  The oil plumes stack on top, and because they are so small they are fiddly to put on and take off.  The cards are not colorful.  The drilling tiles are better--thicker & nicer.

I have mixed feeling about the board.  Black Gold's board is in 7 separate pieces.  This does allow changes in the board layout from game to game--makes it more interesting.  However, I was constantly realigning the boards because each turn they would get moved out of position, and a bump to one of the light segments sends the pieces flying.  Giganten's board is the same size, but a one-piece fold out, and more attractive.

So, I don't need both, but which do I keep?  Having it as a 5-player game is important. But the quality of Giganten  is so superior.  I'm in a quandary.

While I share the common complaint that the art is atrocious, I find Black Gold to be unappealing at its core as well. Perhaps it's because I can't seem to get into the theme, or perhaps it's because I find the Oil Baron mechanic to be clunky and the bidding mechanic to be too simplistic. Maybe it's the fact that the game tries to combine the social aspect of bluffing and bidding with a dry-as-can-be Euro. 

I think that Black Gold really tries to put you in the mindset of a scrounging, desperate wild-catter, constantly struggling against and for the heartless, robotic Capitalist that is the oil baron, while simultaneously pitting yourself desperately against the other yokels trying to pay off Granny's gambling debts. All it manages to make me feel, unfortunately, is Depression-Era-esque listlessness and despair.

This one went down very well with the group.  It's very simple to play having a simple action/move round followed by an auction.  It also looks pretty impressive.

Öl bohren, Öl höchstbietend verkaufen und wer zum Schluss am meisten Geld hat, gewinnt. So tuckert man mit seinem LKW über Felder, bohrt prüfend oder zufällig nach schwarzem Gold und versteigert die Ergüsse seiner sprudelnden Quellen bis zum Versiegen über Bietkarten an drei Oil Companies. Dabei schleppt sich BLACK GOLD recht träge durch die trockene Landschaft. Die Mechanismen sind gewohnt, sie funktionieren und fühlen sich im Kontext von BLACK GOLD doch recht altbacken und verkümmert an. Vielleicht liegt es auch einfach an der braunen Farbgebung, die dem Spieler die Freude an Optik vorenthält,so dass mich das Spiel kein zweites Mal gewinnen wird.

I like the subtlety in choices dictating strategies throughout the game.  The fluxuating markets are a nice touch and can lead to some nasty and competetive play. 

There is randomization, but it more or less just shaves the edge off of perfect information rather than governs the outcome through luck.  

Managing actions between moving the train and advancing your derrick development is a nice balancing act. 

All in all, Black Gold offers a unique experience with strong thematic tie-in which challenges players into making subtle and timely deviations in their plans from other players.  Lots of interaction in auctions, the train race, and blocking/ hindering in the oil fields.

Great game.

Initial impression very good! Enjoyed the auctions, three different markets which fluctuate independently to keep things interesting. Board placement is made trickier by a separate track which must be climbed in order to move out to the most remote fields. Really cool pieces too. More to say on this one later. Looking forward to playing again soon.

This was a really pleasant surprise for me.  Scratches the mid weight auction/bluffing/market manipulation niche for me in about a half-hour per player, and the rules can be taught in five minutes.  Great intro for newbies to the above mentioned genres.  

The two-player rules tweak isn't as tortured as some on here make it sound.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about this game (perhaps I repressed those memories :D). I remember I didn’t like it and that it disappointed me (as I had a higher expectation). The game play is very long for what it offers and it also has a lot of uncontrollable luck  (I could be wrong about this as I don’t remember clearly my only game). I’m a fan of auctions, but still didn’t like the game. The theme doesn’t do anything, good or bad, for me.

Gorgeous components as it is usual from FFG, but ultimately, a very boring game. I´m glad I didn’t buy it and I have no desire to play it again.

You select cards in turn order that have both movement points and give you a certain number of bid cards. Movement is divided between moving your truck on the oil field and moving a train. It is better to keep your train at or ahead of your position on the oil field or you will need to pay whoever has the lead train to move your oil. Oil can be sold at three different auctions. Your money is used to buy oil rigs, but not for the auction. The bid cards are used for the auction. There is some randomness in the amount of oil you receive and in the bid cards having a value of one or two. Still there seemed like enough strategy to keep it fun. There are additional cash bonuses for having your train finish 1st or 2nd and for the number of rigs and oil units left. Cash is your victory points.

Black Gold is a reimplementation of Giganten. The main difference is the possibility to play with five adding a fourth auction round for this player count with slightly differing rules. Otherwise, it plays the same.

It’s a remarkably thematic Euro of producing and selling oil which probably motivated FFG to pick it up many years after its initial release. Each round players have to decide between taking more licenses, thereby increasing bidding power to make better sales, or taking more movement points to improve board position for better drilling opportunities. This trade-off decision is well-designed and provides meaningful differentiation. A few minor options in this decision add variation. Board play is competitive and requests tactical planning to ideally assure the ability to drill a new well each round. The auctions for the right to sell oil reward clever bidding and hand management. So far, so good.

Two reasons lead to its ultimate failure to garner further plays.
1. Game length: The same motions are repeated for at least two or possibly more than three hours in a five-player game. There’s not enough happening and not enough to discover to warrant this game length. In this league it’s up to competition from far better games like Terra Mystica.
2. Random tiles: All wells have some randomness. I’m fine with that as long as I have the possibility to mitigate that randomness as I have with types one and three where I can look beneath before deciding on drilling. Type two randomly awards either two or five oil resources with no advance prospecting. In my play, another player had 12 oil from three drillings, I had 6 oil from the same amount of drilling. This will be no unusual result. In a three-hour game where 6 oil can mean a difference of 20.000 to 30.000 $ or 20% of the final scores, I don’t accept this.

I don't like auction in general, but I do enjoy when it is no-money auction (separate currency for the auction). However, the game feels repetitive and unecessary long... Probably the same experience could be achieved with less turns. It is not a bad game, but not a good one either.

Quite boring and tedious as a two player game. The NPC was too powerful and kept outbidding us so we couldn't sell our oil (and thus had to dump it at a loss)...and when one player finally got to sell all his oil he skyrocketed past the other player by mere happenstance (he just happened to draw the right cards at the right time - not really a display of strategy). Could be at least playable with more people.

Great looking game. 
Looks like it has a lot of thought.
120 min playtime is a major downside. However, I read a review that suggested it'll play in 1hr15min with 2 players (which isn't too burdensome). Seems to scale well (but more players increase play time).

$20 at Fantasy Flight 2012 November sale which is a great deal BUT given the amount of games that are still in their original package and how this game looks like it'll fare with the students, it just won't get played. On the other hand it gets a high fun rating and seems to be a worthwhile purchase (even if it only gets played about 3-4 times).

Interesting mechanics at play from finding oil, to transporting oil, to selling oil in an auction; all whilst possibly screwing your opponent by bluffing, but at the same time taking a risk yourself. It also has an auction, stock market, monopoly feel.

As a collector's item, the price is right, but as a game to be played, it just isn't going to happen.  

Nice BGG ranking at about 1000.

RATING: 6
Played at Origins, and enjoyed it alot.  SUSD has a great review on it, and basically it's a game with inertia that really gives you the stress and strategy of buying low, selling high, all the theme of Monopoly but better.  It's more simplistic of a making-money game, but theremore easy to introduce that genre to people.  The best part of it is bidding, for the right to sell your oil at companies, with the Licences that you keep HIDDEN, so you can lie about what you have, and bid up people, but then they can call your bluff...so, very cool.  But the actual game with moving around to prospect for oil.

Also a simpler game, but would work great with people who like that, I think.  I need to remember it's good to have games like this that don't entirely engage me or my main group, but are great for introducing to people that don't want deep games.

Bought for my family for '14 Christmas, with the hope that they'll play together and have fun.  Of course I was wrong, my family hates games that aren't mindless and hate fun and I hate trying to find something mom will actually enjoy that doesn't also make me want to give oral to a loaded gun.

Great plastic trucks and spurting oil rigs.  Great sense of theme.  Rules are very clear.

This game taught me a valuable lesson. 
No matter how good a game looks or how good the rules read, avoid buying a game where the victory points gained by one player can suddenly blow up to some huge amount because of some random multiplicative effect.


In hindsight I wish I had kept this game and tried houseruling a demand system into it like STOCKPILE to replace the dice rolling.

It's my first auction game and I must say that is pure fun. The rules are simple and the components are gorgeous. After the first three rounds everybody will be bluffing and laughing.

I've played with 4 and 5 players, so I'm not sure how it works as a two player game.

I totally recomend to try this game.

Update after 7 games 7.5

Recently we take the dust out of this game (around 5 months since last play) and I still enjoy it, even after having played a lot more different games that the two or three that I knew at the time of my first game of Black Gold. I still don't understand if the exploration an perforation part of the game play an important role in the game, but the auction part is very entertaining.

Good game, top notch components.

A well structured game that feels like you are running an economic engine.  However, the game is very reliant on math and little rules to the end game scoring.  Players who aren't good in math will find the game frustrating with the numerous multiplications being made.  Also suffers from runaway leader problem.

This game incorporates several fun mechanics. Exploration of territory for oil, auction system to sell oil, bluffing system to raise bid, economic markets, and more. The game is long, but has a clear end/time limit. Really fun.

I don't really own this, but a friend bought it and left it with me so I could learn the rules and teach it.

Did play it and fell in love with it. It blends a lot of different elements together into a very satisfying package. Lots of things to juggle/manage. There's the spatial element with the trucks and trains, the auction element and the drafting of cards where the agonizing choice of what to focus on must be made. There's also a bit of luck between the different value oil derricks and the market die. I wish we played this one more.

This is just hits a really satisfying blend of skill, luck, bidding, bluffing, drafting...it all just works together well for me.

RATING: 6.5
Only one play and we got a rule wrong.  A little concerned the special power cards could be prone to adding too much luck depending on when they come out.  A late game card that moves everyone else back three spaces when you're all up in the 3 per space section can hand a person too many points imo.

This hits my list of highly underrated games.  A unique theme of drilling for oil and then bidding to sell your oil to the oil companies is highly immersive.  The componets are increadible from the trucks you drive through the oil fields to the derricks where you can add oil spouts.  You do have a pretty intense auction phase where you use licenses to bid.  Each turn players choose from cards that determine the number of blind licenses they receive to the amount of spaces their oil carrying train will move.  Again....immersive, fun and very inderrated

Rating based on 1 play with 5, which is a bit too much. 4 is probably ideal. I think I'll use the 'faster game' - option next time. I think rating will go up.

Second play: with 4 and the option to end the game after the black train passes the 3-line. It's a descent family game. You'll have to accept that luck is a basic part of this game and you can't controll anything.

RATING: 5
Black Gold is an auction game with a rather high portion of luck. When searching for effective oil wells, you can  either get lucky or receive real stinkers. In the next step you want to sell your oil to three different companies with independent oil prices. Since every company only buys oil from one player, you auction the rights to sell. In these auction you pay with certificates; as  a rule of thumb: you have more certificates, when you have chosen fewer or less effective actions for exploring digging sights and building wells. Between rounds the oil prices paid by the companies adjust randomly (within boundaries).

This game is about winning auctions and delivering high quantities of oil, when the prices are high, and sneek in some sales for only few certificates, when the prices are moderate. Since you only can store a limited amount of oil, losing an auction can cause a severe loss of your inventory. 

I was not too fond of Black Gold's mechanics, but I am also not a fan of games in which auctions are the  main mechanism. Our game really dragged, especially since it took one round more than expected. The markets mechanisms also seem rather artificial (companies only buying from one player, for example) and for a game of this play length the random component is too high for my taste. While the components are in general good (plastic wells on which you put oil plumes), I am underwhelmed by the art design: a yellow-brown map without interesting details to which the wells in player colors give a stark contrast and cardboard money in which the different nominations were not easy to tell apart (same size, all in greyish brownish color tones). I would have preferred paper money (and why the heck are there no 5000$-notes?!?).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Movement for prospecting to discover oil fields (as well as to progress trains), drilling and transport of oil via trains belonging to all players and the Oil Baron, and auctioning with licenses for the right to sell the oil. Simplifications (such as progress on the train tracks vs. pickup and deliver) make the rules easy and the game faster, and some elements to add fun (e.g. bluffing during the auction, gambling on two rig wells, etc.). Had the promise of a deep economic game with risk management, budgeting, and balance but ultimately settles for being a family game with too much luck (at least with the basic rules).

RATING: 8.4
You always can tell a good game after it is done when everyone keeps talking about it.  Just a great unique set of mechanics.  This game mixes a great combination of business sense with auction and with a little bluffing.  There is some luck involved but there is ample opportunity to compensate.  Through out the game there is always this feel of when should i just go for it.  Another thing that is great thing about this game is that it seems to be forgiving. there is no runaway problem that can plague other game.  Most of all it was just fun.   Hope it has stay power  and enough variety.  The game board is modular and there are a few variants that should keep the spice in the game.

It seems a little random for my tastes. Suffers from the fact it's too random to really be a heavy auction game, but too long to be a filler or light game. That said, it does have some redeeming features - it's got a couple of different ways to make money and thus win (tap and sell, open up lots of little mines, rush the train), and I do like the variable action mechanic (even if it does often screw the person who goes last in a 5 player game).

I can't imagine devoting too many evenings to play this, but I will probably do so on occasion.

Simple but, at the same time, challenging game about finding black gold, and then sell it for the best price. The main mechanic is an auction phase on three companies that offer to buy the oil at different rates. The game is clever and everything seems to fit in place, except the mechanism to change the prices of the auctions, which uses a die. It just feel pedestrian and clumsy, and contrast with the beauty and elegance of the rest of the design.

This is the remake of Giganten, which I never played.  I really liked it.  The market works well and I like the bidding as well as how you can only transport the oil if your train is at that level.  Otherwise you have to pay the leader to transport it for you.  The only quibble I'd say that I have with it is the "peek at a tile for free" mechanic.  It definitely seems like it should cost you something.  Otherwise, a very solid game that I would not mind picking up to fill out an order for free shipping.

Great game, better than I expected! Moving your truck around, drilling for oil, keeping your train ahead to transport it for free yourself to the company of your choice, then bidding for the right to sell at the companies is different each round and fun from the first. It shines best with 4 players, but I do plan on playing it with 2 as well, even though the game flow will be much different. I suppose one could say it takes just a bit too long to play, but it's not so bad. I don't see it outstaying its welcome, even if it takes longer than expected.

[1 play] Very pleased with the simple mechanics that give rise to a very enjoyable game full of veiled bid threats and manipulation. I love a game with a healthy dose of psychology. The theme is interesting and the components are top notch in this edition. If I have a criticism, it would be that I never felt like the play on the oil field was that challenging, and it didn't seem like anyone would ever turn down an opportunity to drill any well.

Looking forward to another go. I almost drank Corey's milkshake. So close.

This one seems like it is close to being a great game, but just didn't quite get there.  Some very interesting mechanics with the trucks and trains and positioning of the wells.  Unfortunately, it is paired with an extremely luck driven market that swings wildly from turn to turn.  That detracts greatly from any possible pre-planning.  The survey mechanic is another interesting piece, but again doesn't matter much to the overall strategy as wells with many plumes aren't much better than wells with few plumes.

Fantasy Flight has made a favorite of mine even better.  The improvements over Giganten aren't many, but they're worth it.  For starters, the board is modular!  That's great in and of itself because the variety just got a huge increase.  Also the increased player range will let me get this to the table a lot more often.  Finally, the numerous variants in the rulebook will really spice things up.

The important part here is that they changed none of the key mechanics, keeping a great engine intact.

If you've ever wanted to own Giganten, buy Black Gold and get a better overall package.

I like the basic idea, but the following ruined it for me
- If one player continually gets the chits with the maximum amount of oil, while an other always gets the minimum amount, one will be at a serious disadvantage (guess what position I was in)
- There are way to many special cards to move all other players' trains back 3 or 4 spaces, meaning they will have to either pay the player in the lead or spend a lot of their actions moving their own trains over and over again. Variation and balance please!
- With the liquidation auction, you have to roll the die to adjust price. If one player persistently gets +3 and +4, and an other always gets -3 or -4, guess who's going to win the game by a BIG margin?
Let's just say our game was far from tight, and there was little we could do about it! The luck factor is just way too high and the game length too long.

Little to long and a little too random for my tastes.  It is a Fantasy Flight game after all.

It's definitely better with 4. I would rate it 7.5 with 4 but only 6 with 2.

A bit like a train game, a bit of market and some exploration. All the right ingredients but not that appealing. Might be better with more than 2.

Black Gold works just fine right up until the train delivery rule hits, and that never makes any thematic sense to anybody.  It gets real easy to ask how a wildcat Texas gusher game got so rulesy in the first place.

A game of economic hubris and bluffing, I feel like I'm playing poker in some of the auctions where I'm trying to drive up the costs for other players, very underrated in my opinion.

This game has great theme, with colorful gushing wells and providing a good sense of the adventure and financial factors of the subject matter. Just the right amount of randomness thrown in, while saving a good amount of strategy and tactics. I liked this one more than I expected to after reading the reviews. This may rise to an 8 if I can get over the fiddly nature of the components.

There are oil plumes!  I was a little wary after looking at the box, but there is a good game here.  The auctions are the meat on the bones.  Sure there is other stuff going on, a race for building, a race for shipping, etc, but the winner is probably going to be whoever is best at winning auctions and selling oil at a premium.

Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron’s train reaches the last track.

A thematic Euro, which seem to be the type of games I most enjoy; also a fun game with interesting mechanics.

i enjoyed this for a while but the board play is superfluous and saving up a pile of shares to earn the right to sell when the oil prices are high is the winning strategy.  

also the 2/5 gambit tiles are awful and game changing

I liked the drafting of the cards to get moves and shares.  not a lot of room for creativity in this.

Clever and fast, but not unique anymore.  The game is definitely all about the bidding, as getting a crack at the market when it's high will make or break your game.  Production of derricks is good, but an extra oil at 3500 isn't nearly as good as selling four oil at 7,000 instead of at 5,000.  The components are gorgeous, and the game plays quickly.  Theme is mildly offputting, as it's a straight-up oil baron theme, with nary a thought to the exploitations of the industry.  Good family/light game, or as an introductory experience for gamers just cutting their euroteeth.

Undeniably fun, but after one play I'm skeptical that there's much to unearth with repeat plays. Which is fine- for what it is Black Gold is a resounding success; it is entertaining driving your little truck around the map looking for oil, and the auctions are exciting if a bit predictable. I felt it overstayed its welcome a bit, but perhaps we were just playing slower than we needed to. A perfectly fine mid-weight game that has an appealing theme and components but is probably too vacuous for me to revisit with frequency. 

UPDATE: thinking more about this one and I just don't see a reason to revisit. Meh.

First play,five players. I went last on the first round. Going last was not fun. Not sure how I would play this one next time but would like to give it a few more plays. There is a lot going on that you need to be patient with.

Quick to pick up and play, and the components looked great.  Things could change fairly quickly when selling oil, so you had to get in while the gettin' was good and try to sell big!

Black Gold is a eurogame take on wildcatter oil speculation. The most obvious comparison is the classic Crude (McMulti) and while it does overlap quite a bit, it feels completely different. There is real feeling of exploration and striking it rich, thanks to the somewhat blind drilling mechanics.

As a whole, I think Crude still probably does a better job at simulating the oil markets. You are in full control of what gets sold at each market and when, whereas Black Gold has all of that tied up in a strange auction, where players spend license cards for the right to sell their oil to each of the national oil companies. It is a bizarre mechanic theme wise, but admittedly does create some interesting game space.

It's a solid game if you don't take it too seriously. Black Gold is a game about speculating, so obviously luck plays a huge role in the equation. Normally that's a turn off, but again, this whole game is about striking it rich, so that kind of random excitement is not only acceptable, but quite enjoyable as well. Well worth checking out, especially if you find it cheap.

Nice remake, modified Giganten that now allows for 5 players.  Excellent components similar to the original.  As a game, it's a solid 7+ Euro with plenty of options to make it a heavier strategy game.

A simple economic/auction game with some luck determining the oil prices and the strength of the liciences you get which prevents it being a brainer burner. I enjoyed the game and at the time of play, I thought it would be an 8, however in cold light of day I think I would always say yes to a game, but wonder if I would suggest it, so only given it a 7. Cute little trucks.

Bought this rather spontaneously online because I thought it sounded like a neat concept. I wasn't watching board game playthroughs back then, I just bought what I felt like buying. It did not let me down, and although we don't play it constantly, I know if I bring it, it will be played.

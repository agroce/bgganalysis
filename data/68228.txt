GAME: Railways of the World: The Card Game
RANK: 1885
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very good attempt to turn the Age of Steam franchise into a card game. It also has a Ticket to Ride feel to it and I wonder (admittedly after only 1 play) whether shipping goods is really a viable alternative to just building big track but it is certainly entertaining enough for now
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A card game version of Railroad Tycoon/Railways of the World that does everything I'd hoped it would do; it's portable (which RRT obviously is not), it has a very similar feel/flavour to it, and yet it has very different aspects to gameplay, and of course the wife loves it.

I love route/shipping games, and as RRT is one of my favourites, this game is right up my alley.  There are several ways to score (another thing I like about games), including: 1) shipping goods, 2) upgrading your engine, 3) building track, and 4) majority connections to cities.  The game ends in the round when either the drawdeck runs out and/or someone runs out of trains and/or the goods run out.  On your turn, you take 1 action (build track which must also connect to a new city card, ship goods, upgrade engine which also allows for a free ship goods action, trade a card, and replenish goods), and then you draw cards either from the display, blind, or from the discard deck.  Cards are either 1 or 2 value tracks, 2-5 value cities, or engine cards, which can also act like wildcard tracks (and you can only draw 1 faceup ala Ticket to Ride).

The game seems to scale well, although I predominantly play it 2er, I have also played 3er.  The components are good, the game is very portable, but I don't like the card size (card quality is very good however)- I don't understand using a non-standard card size in this day and age (yes I'm a card sleever).

There are some neat ideas here in this pseudo-card game.  No mechanics that you really haven't seen before, but it's a different presentation.  I'm not convinced that delivering goods has a measurable impact on the game outcome.

Meh.  Little long and luckish, though it looks great and there are some nifty ideas.  Cube delivery counts for too little!

RATING: 7
How far can you strip down Age of Steam and still retain a worthwhile game?  This game takes us one step further, jettisoning the harsh economics, competition for turn order and actions, and even a board.    Age of Steam's cube delivery remains - and is an important source of vps.  The other, crucial source is control of the stations through having the highest value connections to them.  What's added is Ticket to Ride-esque track and loco card drawing, and connection building.

So is Railways of the World: The Card Game worthwhile?  Yes, I find it quite engaging; it offers a few things to think about and feels surprisingly unlike Age of Steam.  It plays quickly and smoothly, aside from the slightly fiddly route cards.


The quality of the components is pretty good; the plastic trains are nice and the cards are decent quality.  The rule book is well written and clear.

When I first purchased this game, (I paid retail price for it) I thought, that it was a little pricey. BUT after opening up the game, seeing how well the pieces were made, I felt that it was well worth the price. So many times have I bought a game, that once opened I am disappointed in the pieces. They break, made of card board, nothing short of crap. This game is the exception! The pieces are well built, have a nice weight to them, and will provide the ability to play the game over and over. They even include a cloth bag for picking pieces out of - seriously? 
I LOVE IT!

RATING: 8
A great alternative to bring out in lieu of Ticket to Ride.  Features an easy enough ruleset for anybody to get into and play competitively.  The components are good, not great, in that the cards are easy to understand, but the art is kind of bland and the icons and numbers could have been organized more attractively on the cards.  Additionally the cards are made in a currently unsleevable size.  But other than the card issues all of the other components work and look fine.  I find that the game plays great with any number of players and playtime generally clocks around the 45 minute mark.  Gameplay is basically composed of some set collection (Route to City Building, feels like TTR) and pick and delivery (cube delivery, feels like a lighter Steam [haven't played any other Age of Steam version other than that one]).  Overall a great game packed in a small package; check it out for its portability and as something you can bring out instead of TTR for variety's sake.

Egész jó kis kártyaadaptációja a nagyobb hasonmásaunak, szép is, pörgős is. Ami nem tetszett, az a nehézkes és káoszos elrendezés az asztalon, meg az a szabály, hogy több értékű sín is lehelyezhető a kelleténél.

Ami érdekes volt, hogy a szállításért járó pontszám eltér a nagyobb változatokétól.

An OK game but I was expecting a bit more - I had just started to get things going when, all of a sudden, the game was over. Goods cubes didn't seem to be a worthwhile tactic at all and the luck of the cards seemed to be more prevalent than in TTR, which uses a similar card collecting mechanic.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable pick-up-and-deliver card game.  It seems to be a bit short/rushed (with 4p) because you only go through the deck once.  Poaching cubes is a lot different from RRT/RotW... because you cannot connect cities that originate from different spokes of the starting roundhouse.  Each spoke becomes an "island" of track that is only connected to the other "islands" through the roundhouse.  This seems to translate into cube-poaching becoming a take-one-for-the-team situation (where players must use short 1-3 link rail lines to poach cubes instead of being able to use their preferred, long rail line).  Overall, the game seems to become a solitaire situation where players extend their own long rail lines and hope for lucky (high value) cube draws from the bag-of-cubes when they build a new city at the end of the line.

I'm anxious to try this game again, with 2 or 3 players.

I've played a pre-production copy and LOVE IT!  I've been dying to show my lunch time gaming crowd a good pick-up-and-deliver rails game but we never had enough time... until now!  I played a couple of different rules sets, so I'm not sure which one is going to be in the final version. This is definitely more of a gamer's game than any other train card game on the market.  I'm pretty excited to buy my own copy once it is released.

A very light version of Steam/AoS/Railways of the World.  It'd drive you nuts if you were looking for a deep, meaty game; however, as a light filler that feels like AoS/Steam/Railways, this definitely fits the bill.  A good filler game; I just wish it handles more than 4 players.

The game was interesting, but it seemed to end too quickly. Deliveries seemed to be under-utilized; by far the most points came from building routes. This was 4-player and I've heard you get to do more delivering with fewer players.

I understand from a game perspective why they don't allow circular routes, but it seems a little weird, setting-wise, that everything is branching/forking. Nothing like a *real* railroad network.

Overall, not sure what to think. Wouldn't mind playing again, but it's probably not destined to become a favorite. Too many other, better games in the same space.

This thing really is Age of Steam: the Card Game.  You set collect TtR style, then build cities and links with the cards.  Cubes come out randomly, and you deliver them if your loco is big enough.  There is a good amount of opportunity for screwage, but certainly nothing at the level of AoS, so this one is probably better for wuss couples.  I like the game quite a bit, it is a nice twist on pick-up-and-deliver.  Ashar, a huge AoS fan, loves the damn thing, and it is now simply known as "the train game."

Imagine a slightly more freeform/abstracted version of the routebuilding aspect of Ticket to Ride crossed with the goods delivery half of Steam (and a nod to its replenishment mechanism) but with cards only.  If you can, you probably have a good idea of what RotW:tCG is like.  It turns out to be a decent enough game which plays pretty quickly but without anything that promotes it a level beyond that.  One for the ever-growing 'good but not great' list.

RATING: 5
I agree with the summation that others have come up with of Age of Steam meets Ticket to Ride.  This game combines the card drafting of TtR with the network building and cube delivery of Age of Steam.

However, I felt like it really wasn't as fun as either of it's parent games.  I never really felt any tension that makes both of this games ancestors good, as there is never much fear of missing out on a crucial section of track, or having someone else deliver a cube I had been eyeing; there are usually so many open options for track placement and cube delivery.  It just seemed to be a case of draft cards, put them in the best available place, and score the points.

We also had a situation where all of the available face up cards were wild cards, with neither of us wanting to pick them up since we would rather draw two cards than one, and the odds are fairly good of just drawing a blind wild card if you need one.  It doesn't appear as if the rules address this situation, and it made for a kind of lame experience just drawing two off the top of the deck every turn for a good portion of the game.

Card drafting aside, I felt like this game worked mechanically just fine for the most part, but just didn't have that "fun" factor for me.  There was no tension that made me sit on the edge of my seat, or eye-popping graphics that drew me in; just some game mechanics that allow you to score points for doing stuff.  I'd still play it if someone asked, but I doubt I'd actively seek to play it.

Really wanted this one to be good as I love the board game but haven't played it for a long time. It was ok is about the best I can say of it. Seems too much luck in what cities with cubes turn up where - a little too random. The board game lets you see what goods need delivery beforehand which gives much more room for planning. 1 Play.

RATING: 7.5
First play and this game plays crazy fast.  I love that 30 minutes and this game is done, making it a perfect choice for a lunchtime game (therefore we can get a couple of games in during the lunch break).  As per usual I was a lot more excited about a game than everyone else at the table, but I think this is one that could become a favourite heavier filler game very quickly.  It is good to keep your eye on when the game will end to make sure you ship as much as you really want to.

Great recipe for a light train game: one part card drafting used for set collecting and city building. A pinch of trains used for track control and scoring. A dash of wood cubes for pick and delivery. A heaping helping of city control for some heavy scoring at the end. Add some goods set collecting on top of that and you have a winner.

Like Ticket to Ride? Looking for the next logical step up without diving headfirst into the heavy train games? This may be the one for you. You have to balance your actions between constructing routes to towns/cities and making deliveries, while keeping an eye on your opponent's routes so that you can leech off them.

I want to like this game, but it lacks the ability to go through the deck multiple times (a la Ticket to Ride) and thus you can end up with useless cities in your hand, and the effect of getting these down late in the game is huge. Without the limitations of geography, I think this will be a good filler for when you can't get in a better train game (and I include TtR as a better alternative). Also horrendously overpriced at retail $38, this is a $25-$30 game max.

Players use track cards and city cards to build a series of railroad routes and deliver goods. Players work to connect more cities, upgrade their engines for larger carrying capacity and deliver goods through a network of routes across the table. Two versions of rules: one the whole family can play, which is also a great way to introduce them to Railways of the World, and one for more experienced fans of the Railways of the World series.

Played for the first time during lunch break at work.  A fun, dynamic game that shows excellent promise of multiple layers of strategy available upon further play.  I am not a big railway genre fan, but this I would play and I'll get getting a copy soon as it will play well with my family as well as my gaming group.

Although I didn't win, I was able to end the game with a better score than the game's designer (James Eastham) so I guess that's something!

A clever reimplementation of Age of Steam et al stripped down to the bare metal.
The outcome seems a bit too much driven by your luck in the card draw for my liking, but given the relatively quick play I can overlook this.
It can get a bit messy to play with the freeform card placement, but this too is manageable.
Probably my main complaint is that the victory points for number of tracks connected to a city far out weighs the VPs from shipping goods such that shipping goods seems to something you do when there's no other alternative. This is a long way from Age of Steam and even further from Railways of the World where track isnt worth anything if it isnt use to ship goods.
So a good idea, and some clever simplifications, but RotW this isnt.

I enjoyed this game, but felt like it was just lacking a bit, I think I'd like to try the full game. Feels like it should be finicky, but the mix of laying track, shipping goods and dominating towns for end game scoring is really well balanced. Everyone I played with wished the tracks would connect in more ways, it just gets kind of awkward to lay the tracks out at a certain point.

RotW becomes a card game.  Players use cards to make railroad links to new cities and transport goods for points. Lighter & quicker than RotW, incorporates some TTR-like set-collection elements, which also increases randomness and makes it more tactical and less strategic, but also more accessible.  Also has a simplified variant for families, which eliminates cube delivery and limits point scoring to laying track and points for cities that have the most of your tracks connected.  See also my comment about the game-play [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/56124/item/1327225?commentid=1594705#comment1594705]here[/url].  Also look at the designers' [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/571941/draw-deck-variant-reduce-draw-randomness]draw deck variant[/url], which needs some work but is well worthwhile to remove some of the luck of the draw.

Upon opening the decks of cards, they have a different finish--sort of sticky.  They don't stick together--they are easy to shuffle & deal.  I just hope they don't collect dirt.

This game has some mechanics of Ticket to Ride and Martin Wallace Steam games.  If I have a Monopoly-player newbie who is completely unfamiliar with Euro-type games, I would introduce Ticket to Ride, then this card game, then on to one of the Steam games. I think that would be easy transitions.  I can't see my fellow, hard core Steam players enjoying this card game, however.

Very Big luck element in the draw of the cards.  One persons could draw no cities (which means you cannot build track or get any points for delivery), and another did not manage to draw any trains and could make no deliveries, which means the game was between the other 2 players.

Ticket to Ride got married to Railroad Tycoon.  Their son was sent to live with his foster father, dominos.  The result was this game, and the result is surprisingly fun considering the foregoing description.  The game is also very fast.  Not bad at all.  If you were looking to bridge a ticket to ride lover into playing heavier games, this would be a required link in that chain.  For me, it isn't light enough to play with my aunt lulu at christmas but isn't really meaty enough for hardcore gamers.  Nice game though, and one I would love to play a second time.

Draft cards like Ticket to Ride. Form the board with them like Dominoes. Deliver goods across the board like Age of Steam. Does this sound fun to you? I thought it was just alright, but then I don't much care for Ticket to Ride or Dominoes. 

Here's a little tip: Don't waste those locomotives building track. Get your locomotive value up! They are way more important here than in Ticket to Ride.

Since I like the Railroad Tycoon board game, I figured I'd also probably like a card game version, and it turns out to be just as good. All the fun of building tracks and delivering goods in a much more compact and quicker to play form! A great choice when you don't want something as complex or want to play a train game in a shorter time.

Looks like a cross between Railways of the World and Mexican Train Dominoes.  Add in gameplay elements of Ticket to Ride and a clever territory control system.

RotW:TCG plays quickly and easily but forces the player to balance multiple ways to score points.  It is this non-train-gamer's new favorite train game.

Might play well with 2 players? Luck might be a factor but maybe can be tweaked like cubes?

EDIT - Played it as a 2 player game. I love the concept of the game and what it is trying to do, distill RRT into a shorter card game that can also work for 2 players, and it largely succeeds less the below. 

- Luck in the draw was quite high due to deck design (5 track colours and distribution) and draw rules, even for the length of the game, length was a good aspect however as its fairly short. It doesn't effect the whole game but what it does effect is disappointing and probably why the designer has now come up with an official variant. Not sure if the variant goes too far the other way, but that is still likely better than the original rules. 

- Game takes up A LOT of room, especially at higher player numbers and track is often running into each other, in other words its a big mess. 

So you do get a good bit of the flavour of the board game in this game and it is much shorter. I found it a strange rule you couldn't connect two existing cities but during play I think I seen a possible reason for this. Multiple ways to score good yet something was kind of lacking here and the luck never helped my overall opinion either. I'll have to play it again with the tweaked draw rules to see if my opinion improves. 

Probably best 2 or at most 3 players

The person who taught it to me described it as kind of a cross between Railroad Tycoon and Ticket to Ride.  That's a fair characterization.  I like both of those games, but Railroad Tycoon is a bit on the heavy side for me.  So this game is great for me in that it provides all the theme with not all the overhead.

This was a nice game of building routes and placing cities based on the cards in your hand and then delivering goods for victory points. Route colors need to match the connection for the city. Engines can be used as wild cards or they can be played in front of you to increase the length of route that you can use to make a delivery. Goods are placed randomly on new cities. The color of the good limits delivery to cities that accept that color.

A pretty good mix of Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam that can be done in 45 min 1 hour, it fit a niche in my board game collection. It's one of the rare game that pretty much everyone who tried the game did like it so it gets played quite a lot lately.

The only real negative of this one is the non standard size of the cards, so it's not easy to sleeve them. Even if the cards are sturdy, I fear the long term use.

Played once, 2 player.  This is not a 2 player game, despite the description or design intent.  I imagine this would be a nice, fast way to get that Railroad Tycoon (or whatever you want to call it) feeling with more players, though.  There is still goods delivery and route tracing, etc.  Just, skip it with only 2 players.

LIKES:

* Different choices make the game interesting as you can earn points via laying track to new cities, playing locomotive cards and making deliveries, or just making deliveries if everything else fails.  
* The connection between how many locomotives you have in front of you representing how many links you can take a good is an interesting mechanic.  I also appreciate that you score the full value (equal to number of links traveled) and not just your own links.  If you use links owned by others, both of you score a point for that link.
* Plays very quickly.

DISLIKE:

* I don't like that you cannot connect two existing cities.  You can only lay track and connect an existing city to a new city.  This can make it difficult to develop a number of connected links and forces you to share more points.
* End game scoring for cities is semi-interesting as the person who has the highest value of track links attached earns the value of the city.  
* Randomness of the card draw can be frustrating (IE, I never drew locomotives and wasn't overly involved in the delivery option as a result).  Still, you can win with this happening.  
* Cards laid out as track make for a messy display.

Only one play with two players, which is going to be very few people's favourite way to play this game. Thanks to Scott Nicholson for bringing his copy to DexCon 13 where I played it with him.

Overall, there are some very cute and clever systems at work in this card game derivative, but not as much tension as I would like, and It's probably 10-15 minutes too long, even allowing for the fact this was a learning game for me. The objectives are twofold, really. One is to build a powerful rail network, which branches off from a hexagonal hub. Links are made form that hub to cities – and then from cities to other cities – by playing a city card from your hand, and then playing rail cards to form a link. Both ends of the link must be the same (single) colour as the rail cards being used, and you must play, at a minimum, a number of rail cards equal to the size of the city. Your score is based on how many rail cards you play, not the size of the city.

Instead, the size of the city determines how many goods it comes into play with, which leads to the second major element, pick-up-and-deliver. Each city has one or more colours of goods that it demands, and players score points for delivering goods. Unfortunately, those points do not automatically go to the delivering player. Instead, one point is scored for every link crossed in the delivery, and the owner (creator) of the link gets it. The first link crossed must be owned by the player making the delivery.

There is also an endgame set collection scoring for goods delivered, with bonuses for depth and width of collecting. and for "ownership" of a city based on rail cards connected to it.

Perhaps it is because I forgot about the city scoring at the end of the game, but I had little feeling of conflict with my opponent. With a couple exceptions, we each built our own networks off of different arms of the hub, and delivered to our own cities through our own links, or else let the goods sit where they were. Endgame set collection is, I suspect, meant to change this, and it may do a good job of it with 4+ players. I just hope downtime doesn't spoil this.

Also, cards are brought into your hand through vanilla card drafting (think Ticket to Ride), and with two engine cards aren't worth all that much, relatively, so the card display had a tendency to get clogged up with them rather than risk unveiling something juicy for your opponent. This, also, would be alleviated by having more players, since the limits on engine supply would become more meaningful.

All in all, I would like an opportunity to play RotW: tCG again with 3, or ideally 4 players to see how that changes the game, but I don't see myself playing it heavily. It's a nice, clean design that ports rail gaming concepts into a card game in interesting ways, but it seems to lack that spark which would elevate it, the real hook of meaty decisions.

RATING: 6
A great intro to pick up and deliver.  You expand a rail network by playing track cards that allow you to setup cities of different colors.  When you put out cities, you put little cubes out of those same four colors and they want to be delivered to cities of the same color.  Game mechanic is simple, and will remind players of Steam or AoS.  Very light but a lot of interesting choices in trying to steal city points from other players.

A pleasant, but pricey, little game.  It's much more of a tactical game than its big brother.  You build cities along with links, rather than build links to drain existing cities.
I don't like that fact that you have to hope you draw enough city cards, or you're toast.  The last person to play has a big advantage in that they can play a big city that no one can take away, and it will likely take away someone else's city.

This game is good, and provides a nice route building/pick up and deliver/economic game in a small package.  However, after a few plays I just don't know that there's anything overly compelling about it.  Using the cards for the tracks is clever, but also messy and a bit cumbersome to deal with.  The per-turn decisions seem fairly well balanced and do require some planning and strategy.  Overall, it's good but not fantastic, and at least for me probably has fairly low replay value.  For a quick, portable 'pick up and deliver' game, Great Heartland Hauling seems to do a better job.

A friend gave me Railways Of The World when he moved house. Turns out it was The Card Game, not the board game. I've never played the RotW boardgame, or any other Train game, but from what I've seen, The Card Game is mechanically very similar to the boardgame.

I was surprised by the components. Although it is titled 'The Card Game', it has a scoreboard, train minis, and cubes, all of which are lifted from the boardgame version. Cards are used to create the board which is both a good and bad thing. The variation this gives each game is good, but it also makes the 'board' very delicate and a nudge can disturb everything.

RotW:TCG is easy to learn and to teach, but is a little too involved to be just a 2-player filler. Its lack of a big shiny board everyone can gather 'round prejudices my gaming friends against it in larger gatherings.

To sum it up: Railways Of The World Lite.

I think they did a better job of capturing the flavor of Railroad Tycoon with this than the Ticket to Ride card game did of imitating its progenitor.  

It's fun and moves reasonably fast after a  couple of plays.  The strategy is straight forward and is an efficiency race.  We have only played semi-aggressive city stealing strategies as of yet since it seems less efficient.  

Great for short game times and a good 2-player game.  Not as meaty as my favorites and though it's usually possible to plan some turns ahead and use whatever draw you get, it is possible to get screwed by the luck of the draw.

RATING: 6
It's a nice adaptation of the Railways world into the card scene, capturing the essence of building up your engine, laying track and running cubes. You draw 2 cards per turn either from the 3 card draft or blind and these'll be either track in different colours, a +1 engine (which doubles as a wild track) or cities. To connect two cities, each city must have an exit in the same colour as the track you're playing, and you must play track cards of value >= to the played city card, scoring points equal to the track layed. Thus you construct a network of linked cities. Each city is one of the 4 cube colours and is populated with cubes. An action may then be to run a cube towards a city of the cube's colour, scoring points for each link passed over, as long as you have engines >= # links. Traditional rules. So each turn you're scoring points. In fact it's one person's full time job to ensure points are tracked correctly. It's another person's full time job to get the cubes out. It's another person's full time job to keep the draft stocked. There's a lot of fiddly here. Also, as you'd expect because it's a card game, it's easy to get hosed on the cards you get. If you draw lots of track but no cities in the colour you have lots of track for, hard luck. Similarly, drawing lots of cities with little track, hard luck. Setting up for long cube runs is the obvious strategy. Getting the cards to set up the long runs is another thing. I was upbeat playing the game to begin with because the adaptation seemed so elegant, but this luck, combined with the fiddly, dragged the rating lower as the game progressed, leaving me feeling the game was, in the end, ok but not something I needed to seek.

I think I'd appreciate this game more if it weren't a giant mess.  Having a hexagonal center tile doesn't make geometric sense, and just causes all the cards to end up all jumbled together.  The drafting system is okay--lots of times there are cards that are just flat out better than others, and there's little incentive to take the lesser cards, which build up.  The building of cities and the pick-up-and-deliver was enjoyable, but I kept wishing there was a board so that it wasn't all a mess of cards that was hard to see.

Achieves what it wants to competently but isn’t very exciting. It’s basically a hybrid of Ticket to Ride set collection for track building and Railroad Tycoon style cube deliveries, but without any of the economic element of RRT. It works fine and plays quite quickly but we weren’t sure about the balance between the actions and scoring opportunities. Replenishing a city with one cube seemed pretty poor (although to be fair we did play that you had to nominate the city before pulling the cube from the bag, which is incorrect) when building a city gets you several cubes, the points for track-building and possible control of the city at the end of the game. And the end-game bonuses for control of cities dwarfed the cube sets and points for engines to the extent that those bonuses seemed a bit pointless.

Pros:
* Plays fast

Cons:
* I'd rather play Gin Rummy or Rummikub. Those two games have more interaction and strategic depth than this one.

Strangely enough, even though the box of this is tiny, it takes as much space to play as its board game ancestor.

Really good implementation of RotW board game. Emphasise on the pick up and deliver - my favourite part of train games anyway. Also like the competition to build the highest point value track into each station. Only played once, but like the board game, would rather play this than Age of Steam.

Fun! Lighter than the RotW board games, and lacking their tight competition for real estate, but still offering some interesting choices and the chance to mess with your opponents' scoring opportunities. It also takes less time to play than the board games, and has more depth than you usually get from a game of its length. You have your choice of the full rules or a simplified "family" rule set.

I have been kicking the idea of purchasing the "board game" version of Railways of the World for a while now.  I decided I would try the card game out to get my feet wet.

My first impression is that this is a very nice card game that really requires a lot of strategy and planning.  There are quite a few ways to score points - many of which are not determined until the games' end.  As a result, you constantly have to be on the watch for people threatening to control the city you thought was yours, or making inroads into your city to transport the good you were planning on transportinga turn or two later.

My first game was with two, and I am thinking this will be great with 3 or 4 players.  Depending on how a game with 3 or 4 goes, I may have to bump my rating up a bit.

I like the little trains that came with the game - very nice.  I understand why the cards are small (to save table space) but I wish they were a little larger.

Wyndham, Allen and I enjoyed it at EuroQuest in November 2010(?). Hit of the convention for us. As of June, 2013 it doesn't get played too much but I give it a 7.6. Must use the expansion or at least the new draw pile set-up.

It was ok, but there was a disproportionate emphasis on building cities. Delivering cubes seemed to be a diversion designed to earn you a small number of points as you rebuilt your hand.

hmmm. This plays like Ticket to Ride with some Age of Steam mechanics peppered in.  I liked the mechanics that they borrowed from the other games, but feel like there are a couple things missing here.  There was little to no tension for getting your stuff played.  

I think the layout of the game is a little rediculous as well...  it turns into a mess early and never really gets much better.  Really, I felt like the game would have been better had they kept a board with it that only allowed for certain connections.

The art is pretty terrible, beyond the stock engine art.

An alright game, but card draw plays a huge factor in what you are able to do.  I also felt like building the routes with the cards made the table really messy really quickly and was hard to accomplish with lots of crossing cards.  I'd prefer something else for a light game.

It feels like they tossed a little of Wallace's Age of Steam (sans board), mixed it together with Ticket to Ride (sans board), stirred and crammed it all into a nice small box. I quite like it. There's some good choices and does what it intends to do. There are a variety of ways to score points and that's a good thing here because you can't do them all properly. Sure, without the board it's a bit... hmm... soulless, but as a light 30-45 game it holds up well. Probably a little better with three than with four.

Gave this one a try.  Once and done, folks.  As this game is based on cards, you are truly at the mercy of the luck of the draw.  Not only do you need to draw the cities, they need to be the right color to match the track you might draw.  And if you don't draw any of the limited locomotives, you can't deliver any goods you might be in proximity of.  Draw a town, but can't match the track colors - either heading out of one town or into that one, can't build.  

And if the cards happen to go your way, you can walk away with it all and no one can do anything about it.

This is a nice railroad game that can be played under 1 hour and easy to transport (small box). If you are looking for serious railroad game, then try the board game since this is not suppose to be heavy.

A 2011-es esseniek közül az egyik csalódás. Az Age of Steam átültetve kártyajátékra. Már az ötlet se ígér túl jót, mert az AoS egyértelműen egy komoly táblás játék. A kártyásban kártyákból épülnek a városok és a köztük levő sínek is. Itt szinte mindenért pont jár: a vágányokért, a leszállított árúért, a megépített városért annak, akinek a leghosszabb síne vezet oda és még célkártyák is vannak. A pálya így folyamatosan épül, ami szinte átláthatatlan a vége felé. A pontozás macerás, számolgatós. Az pedig, hogy bármennyi sínt le lehet tenni két város közt, hogy ezzel a várospontját is megkapjuk nekem nagyon idegen dolog volt. Így el tudom képzelni, hogy áruszállítás nélkül is simán lehet benne nyerni, ami elég érdekes egy szállításra épülő játék esetében. Ezt a játékot nem kellett volna elkészíteni. Táblásban az egyik legnagyobb, kártyásan se nem könnyed, se nem jól működő. A kivitelezése is a dobozon kívül nem egy fantasztikum. Nem tetszett.

I actually really like the gameplay, as it does really capture the essence of the main game. The problem is that it does not help all that much to build off of someone else's links all that much and I just struggle to see how the strategies can be all that interesting.

A simple and light game that scratches the Railroad Tycoon track building, goods delivering itch incredibly well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice blending of mechanisms from Ticket to Ride (card drawing, set collection, route building, VP increasing with route length) and Railroad Tycoon (trains, cube delivery, engine link levels, etc.), with only a bit of weirdness:
- why do you get income for the ENTIRE length of delivery (even when using others' links), as well as giving the others their VP?
- why must you start moving cube over your own link (silly holdover from Railways; I prefer the Steam/Age of Steam versions of goods delivery rules).

Actually, I think I like this better than both the TTR Card game and Railways. It's got some card randomness, but the game plays pretty quickly and there's some control due to face up draw cards; the randomness doesn't ruin the rest of the game like it does in Railroad Tycoon!

I wasn't playing this correct the first time, realized the errors. I think it's decent but I just like playing rail games on a board. The cards are great for portability but, I'll just take an easier game to set-up for portable options.

More like a cross between Canal Mania and Railways of the World.

I like the simplicity of the rules and that the game is colour blind friendly, however given the amount of space it takes up on the table  i'd prefer to play a board game.

Another think i am not keen on is you always have to build to a new city. The whole point of Railways of the World /Railroad Tycoon is the over the top production and this does not quite have it

One play so far.  Not sure about the depth of this.  IS there a good strategy to break away from your own set of tracks?  Maybe, but I am not sold on that yet.  If there is not, there is not much game in here besides luck.

An abstraction of an abstraction, yet better than expected. It took me half the game to adjust to the fact that we couldn't build to connect existing cities - only spread out to build new cities. Rewarding city building, goods shipping, goods set collecting & city-influence gives you plenty of different ways of collecting points.

This game was alright.  There was a lot of luck in the card draw, and the strategy is not deep, but there is a layer there that makes it interesting.

The games I've played have been close.  It's easy to set up and teach, it adds a little bit of delivery mechanic to ticket to ride style gameplay and card draw.  It can be a logical step for new gamers to play the great train games. (Age of Steam!!!!)

10-Sep-10: We played Railways of the World Card Game during work lunch games. It was.. okay. End scores were closer than expected. But there seemed to be very limited ways to stop each other from delivering goods, mainly because of the rule that "You can only build to a new city. You cannot connect 2 existing cities." So that means that when a new city is played, only 1 player has access to that city. You can only steal cubes from that new city by building another link out from that city, but that usually isn't worth it. But then again, its got some different scorings for deliveries. It makes sense to use other ppl's links as much as possible sometimes. You only need to own the first link any cube delivery. And you earn the full score of links travelled in the delivery. So say I make a 5 link delivery, and only own the 1st link, that gives me 5pts. Other players get 1 pt for link they owned in the delivery. So now you need to look at the Nett gain of points in deliveries. Anyway, it feels a little fiddly in some ways, but it's still a decent game.

20-Sep-10: In some ways, its what TtR:Card game should have been. It focuses less on delivering Cubes and more on connecting Cities. But you can't say that someone who did nothing but Connect cities will win, because you need to Deliver some cubes too. So far, we've seen that the winner tends to be the one who Connects Cities 80%, and Delivers Cubes 20%. City cards are too important to pass up as you need them to build new tracks and they are worth quite a number of points in the end. Anyway, it's a light game, and I'm still exploring ways to win besides Connecting Cities but even if that turns out to be the main way, then so be it - it's still an okay game.

Cards!  Pick-up and deliver!  Trains!  Short play time!  Nothing much to complain about.

I have waited far too long to play this great game.  I love the combination of railway games that form in this light railway/card game.  I actually played this with the designers before the game was published.  they explained it well, I'm sure, but at 2 am at Origins, it didn't make much sense.  However, meeting them again in 2011 they were great gentlemen and I figured it would be good purchase.

Let's just say, after 20 minutes, my wife said she liked the game.

C'est un petit filler plus gamer. Juste pour ça, je lui lève mon chapeau. La matériel est de belle qualité, mais n'est pas parfaitement fonctionnel (les piles finissent par se chevaucher).

I'm still learning its depths, so my rating may change.  I really like this game as a light Railways game.  I think I would enjoy the heavier ones, but who knows when or if I'll get a chance to try one.  It seems like there is too little goods delivering, but maybe that's because of general inexperience.  The deck seems to run out just when things are getting interesting.  (maybe this is the sign that I'd like the more serious railroad games... :) )

It combines the set-collection mechanisms of Ticket to Ride with the route-building and goods-shipping mechanisms of the Steam family. I have heard complaints about the cards being too cluttered, though I disagree. I think the abstractness of the gameplay is the only design problem - it's hard to get excited about "a level 5 city" where "Chicago" would have been more interesting, but I understand the designers' reasons.

One play.  A lot of play value in a small box.  The card layout looks a little untidy, and it seems wrong that there can't be connections between the different branches of the 'snowflake', but I appreciated the lack of a fixed board as it helped me focus on the distance-in-links.

Railways of the World The Card Game is a fast paced card game adaptation of the popular Railways of the World board game series. In Railways of the World The Card Game players use track cards and city cards to build a series of railroad routes and deliver goods!

As the game progresses, players work to connect more cities, upgrade their engines for larger carrying capacity and deliver goods through a network of routes across the table.

Excellent fast game that combines Age of Steam cube delivery mechanisms with drawing elements from Ticket to Ride.  Fast moving with enough strategy and card management to keep it fresh.  Good replay ability.  Great with 2 players, but allowing for play up to four is a bonus.  Typically overpriced by FRED at MSRP for what you get.  The online price at 35% off is about what you should pay, however the components are very good.  The scoring board is a nice touch as are the plastic trains, which may have contributed to the higher pricing.

Wallace's cube-delivery mechanic boiled down to its boardless essence, and somehow it's not too bad.  Though I do have concerns (based on one play) that points largely stem from track building and city scoring rather than cube delivery.  A variant with increased endgame cube bonuses might be in order.

The inability to build between hub spokes limits strategic options, but that's acceptable in a light game meant to be played in 45 minutes.  And the omission of random event cards - which are found in the Railways of the World board game - is a big plus.

So the game does fill a niche.  There are people who won't play Railways of the World, Steam, or Age of Steam who will play the Railways card game.  And people who enjoy the Steam family of games shouldn't mind a 45-minute fix of their favorite mechanism.

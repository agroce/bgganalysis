Great and unusual game.
For once I have to abandon my attempt to play optimally and try to role-play the different factions.
Especially good that it is very hard to tell who is winning until the end....

Recently tried the new version and found it much the same as the old one in feeling.  I love it - but its a very LONG game - 4 of us took 6 hours to play a game...

Very good game.  On the plus side the rules, board and pieces are of high quality (FFG version).  It really must be played with four players.  The only real downside it game lengh.  Our group takes over 5 hours to play.  If somehow it could be played in 3 hours I would give it a 9.5.  Glad to have it now a part of my collection.

I played this ages ago and really enjoyed it.  Since then, I've purchased it and am waiting to find time to try it again.  I have the AH General Ireland expansion.  My rating on this may change, but my memories of this were that it was medium weight, fun and high on interesting twists and interaction. A generally good AH game, though perhaps time to play may be an issue at this moment in my life (young kids).

The theme and mechanics of this game is a success. When playing, you really get the feeling that you are playing through the history of Britannia, with the historical events appearing when they (almost) should and where you, the player, can change history. Luck, however, plays an important part in the game as the risk-style dice-rolling to resolve combat can get annoying. The game also feels very long to play, and with the countless invasions filling the game, it quickly gets a feeling of repetition as well.

I enjoyed playing the 4 person game and would jump at the chance to play it again (assuming I had the time to give).

Great game, it is just a class of History, britain history. It has a simple war mechanic that works very well, the main problem with this game is that it is good only with 4 players and has a big downtime.

RATING: 7.5
This is one of those games that really works if things are lined up just right, and otherwise can be something of a mess.  Best is (i) a four player game in which (ii) everyone knows the expected point value to aim at for their colour at each stage and (iii) the Roman invasion hasn't gone completely pear-shaped.  If all of those conditions are met, this is a lot of fun.

Tribal expansion game based in Britain. Mainly about all the races that have invaded over the centuries. It works ok but can be slow.A game that may explain why GB decided it was better to colonise a quarter of the world than be invaded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the best light multiplayer wargame. Each faction that comes into play brings with it the problems and advantages as would historically possible. 

Each player controlling a few factions do prevent player elimination in such multiplayer games. It also forces the players to divide its resources and energy to play each faction to its best possible VP.

The overlapping need of VP areas bring about definate confrontation.

Though in a gamey sense, we've learn to appreciate its simple study of the struggle of britannia during those dark days.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fun, fairly easy game to learn and play.  Very 'dicey' combat system that can be frustrating.  The player factions are somewhat balanced.  Game play is fluid and encourages players not to 'turtle'.  The game length is very long, feels like a player should get more for the time invested.  The components are of excellent quality.

I loved the Avalon Hill version of the game. Heard not so great things about the newer version.

RATING: 7
A venerable multi-player wargame that has stood the test of time surprisingly well.  Thanks to the constant arrivals of invading peoples, the players will at different times feel like the playground bully and the bully's victims.  The factions are also asymmetric, which adds interest and is potentially a problem with inexperienced players.  It takes a long time and a lot of persecution for the big score amassed by the Romans to look not quite so impressive.  

I own the Avalon Hill edition of the game, with rules in their customary legalese.  Production and artwork are pretty decent.  I recently played the FFG edition and quite liked the changes made to the game.  I was less happy with the Green and Pleasant Land painted a parched yellow, with the late medieval castles representing Roman forts and with the rather silly psycho Scots.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although the differences seems minor, I own both versions of the game. I couldn't resist! I just to play this one in the past a lot, but haven't played the new edition yet. What I don't like is that there are no longer tribe names on the counters. And couldn't the backsides of the counters be used to put the 3- and 5-playergame sides in one color?

Actually I wasn't waiting for a reissue. I would have prefered a more modern and little more fastplaying and interactive game on this topic. In other words card-driven!

Every side plays differently and every game is unique. You can't play this one in an evening, but an afternoon and half an evening will do.

I like a lot the asymmetrical design of the game. On the other hand I have mixed feelings about the fact that basicly you are at the mercy of the other players. For example if green decides to fight to death with wales against romans it's game over for both players. Some of these destructive decisions aren't even that easy to see at the time of the decision.

With experienced players (meaning at least one game under the belt) this is great experience.

Other bad thing is the length which is a bit too long.

I love history and map games. There is enough variety to keep the game interesting. One drawback is that, even after many, many games (80?) it still is difficult to assess who is winning and therefore it's not always easy to see what the best move is - ie, whom to attack. That's the only reason I can't give it a 10 rating.

Note: I own but haven't yet played the FFG version, so these comments are for the AH version. I think Britannia has a lot of flaws. It's highly scripted, and its variance from the script is often determined mostly by dice. Yet its simplicity and epic scope really make up for these issues. It also was the first game I played wherein players get to run more than one nation, and where some nation groups are strong early and weak late, some the converse, and some balanced throughout.

One game (FFG edition) seems like an extremely unfair basis for a rating of something like this, but I really dug it. I'm a fan of serial replay, and this seems like an ultimate kind of game for that. It's on rails, and history cannot be entirely broken, but it can be bent. Wish there were more games out there just like this, especially shorter ones.

I like the feeling of flowing history this game provides. There's plenty of strategy to chew on as well, and the potential interaction between peoples of the same player is rather unusual. It's a pretty long game though, and needs to be played with some care: you need to know when to fold, otherwise you can end up in a situation like what happened in one of the games I played, where a player had nothing to do for half the game.

Muy buen juego aunque no es de los míos. Funciona perfectamente a 4 jugadores (de hecho cojeará a menos seguro). Es algo largo y se presta al A/P pero al existir azar, en forma de dados, el tiempo de espera es llevadero, ya que las desgracias ajenas siempre son bien recibidas. 
El juego abarca 1000 años de invasiones en los que los jugadores llevan varias facciones que se suceden (o no) en el tiempo y el objetivo es que cada pueblo les proporcionen el máximo de puntos de victoria.
Respecto a la rejugabilidad tengo mis dudas. El juego es bastante dirigido por dos factores:

- Cada turno de los 16 suceden cosas. Aparecen nuevas civilizaciones, reciben refuerzos otras y se hacen recuentos de puntos según una tabla que está presente en el propio tablero. Para mí, es una solución muy lograda ya que sucede lo que tiene que suceder y en la primera partida es una sensación curiosa, como estar metido dentro de la maquinaria de un reloj. Pero en una segunda partida ya veo lo que va a suceder y el efecto sorpresa desaparece. Cada pueblo invade siempre en un turno predeterminado, siempre con los mismos refuerzos y siempre con las mismas opciones de desembarco o de oleada. Ya depende de los dados y la estrategia de cada uno para hacer cada partida completamente distinta.

- Además cada pueblo pilla puntos según qué territorios controle. Así que un pueblo siempre se centrará en controlar una misma zona, ya que controlar zonas que no den puntos sólo sirve para conseguir algo de refuerzos. Nada más.

Romans, Saxons, Normans, Norsemen, Dubliners, Danes, Picts, Scots and so on. All the people I played with loved the game. Easy rules, lots of strategies for all the different invaders. Great fun to play and one of my most beautyful games. Great gamemap that deserves that name (Greetings to GMT!!! They make great games but pityful gamemaps) and due to the many waves of invasions that hit the isle all the players get to have a "high time" sooner or later. Luck is not on my side in this game, but just for the great map and styling Fantasy Flight Games deserves a medal. If you dont have it then for God's sake buy it! Also have the old Avalon Hill version of the game but map and counters are most boring.

Ugh. After being coached by experienced players at this game I found myself in the untenous position of being effectively eliminated in the third round. I did everything I was "supposed" to do, which involved all of 3 or 4 decisions in 1.5 hours. All I had to look forward to was 4 or 5 more hours of watching the other players play. Any game in which I get to make a decision only every 20 minutes or so at best is not a game I will ever play again.

Wow!!! Super fun. A 4 player (yes, you really need to play with 4 exactly, despite the variants at the end of the rulebook) game chronicling 1000 years of English history. Each player controls 4 or 5 different nationalities all trying to carve out their own little space on the island. Different forces enter the game at different times each with their own rules and ways for getting VP's. Early nations are trying to destroy Roman forces as the Romans are the big bullies in the early turns. Later on, the Saxons come in. Meanwhile, the Caledonians and the Picts are fighting in the north. I love how each nation feels very different and each player gets a "big" group for a few turns. Rules are actually very simple with a few minor one offs that we needed to check the rulebook for. Leaders also enter the game which can significantly help their nation or give big VP's if another player can kill them. In our game, blue was able to pull out the win with some huge VP's turns in the midgame controlling the Angles and late game (last turn) with the Normans. 

My only potential drawbacks to this game would be the time. Our game ran almost 5 hours. Not everyone wants to sit through a 5 hour slug-a-thon dicefest. Also, I can see each game playing very similarly following history as you get maximum VP's for doing historically what these nations did. We will play this again soon and maybe try to mix it up and try something different to see how the flow of the game changes. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a passing interest in British history.

Very balanced war/civilization game. Nice mechanisms and variations on the rules for the different civilizations. It just takes to long for what the game is because there can be extended periods in the game where the people you are leading are to weak to mean anything. Maybe after a few plays I will get quicker at it. That would certainly help this game. Also seems a bit scripted.

Fantasy Flight version after 1 play: Engrossing, easy-to-learn, game covering the epic sweep of history in Britain from the invasions of Rome through William the Conqueror. Fantasy Flight's rendition is a colorfully produced effort and seems to have picked up a few cues from Phalanx's treatment of historical games. It also retails considerably lower than their most recent sci-fi and fantasy efforts, too. The biggest drawback is the playing time, which can run into the 4-5 hour range. (For historical boardgamers, that's not a serious complaint. Just be aware that you'll be in for a long afternoon or evening.) (Initial rating: 5)

Update 12/09: After about a dozen games, I'll probably never play this one again. My last game took 6 hours with experienced players. It was a blowout for the Welsh/ Caledonian/ Jute/ Danish (Green player). If Green doesn't win, they usually do very well (usually second place) no matter who is playing them. The Red player must use the Irish to hobble the Welsh—and even so, the Yellow should use the Romans and the Blue should use the Picts to also nibble on Green's kingdoms. If they don't, it's just too easy for Green to sit back and rack up points. 

A better balance might be to nerf Green's VP awards by trimming a point for each held Welsh and Caledonian territory on scoring rounds.

I played the Avalon Hill version.  I was impressed.  The components are well done and the rules are very simple and complete.  You can sit down and play quickly and enjoy the game.It keeps plaeyrs interested.  

It is also a great way to learn some early history.

Two negatives are that the game ties to somewhat to historical outcomes.  Secondly, the game really needs four players, it just doesn't work well with fewer.

RATING: 8.3
Chucked the insert immediately, as it fits the box, but appears to be for a totally different game. Hex shaped inserts, a triangle shaped bit? How odd! I bought my own plastic storage box, which should help in future.

The game can be said to be "scripted" and can be said to have an element of luck with the dice rolling for  combat, but overall, the game needs some scripted elements to allow for balance between 4 players playing 4 or 5 different nations each.

I like the metagaming aspects here where you have to work with other players at times (even the ones you have just attacked elsewhere) and then you may need to sacrifice one of your own nations to allow another to prosper. Interesting stuff!

Play with the right people and you can rattle through this in 3 hours. Get stuck and you can be there for twice as long.

This FFG remake of an earlier classic improves upon the original and is gorgeous to boot! The Phalanx influence on component quality is evident in FFG's treatment. The rules are relatively clear and concise; the epic span of British history captured elegantly; the mechanics simple but satisfying. The cliche "simple to learn but difficult to master" applies here in spades. The flow of the game and learning to play each colour requires some dedication. The reward however is a fascinating and immersive experience.

The downside is that a full game may take up to six hours to complete and it is not a game you can arbitrarily terminate at any point then simply total up VPs to determine the "winner." Proper play balance really requires you to finish the game. Slugfests of this nature were common back in the day but are difficult to sell nowadays with gamers who have largely become Euro-ized. Still, very much a keeper!

As I'd hoped, an experienced group will bring the playing time down considerably. An evening session is becoming quite feasible. Wonderful game!

Original Version: Used to play this a lot in the 80's and early 90's. But it needs exactly 4 players and play time is quite long, plus there are balance problems, not all sides are equal.
Re-release: Only played it once - an improvement, seems a bit more balanced and I'm keen to try out the 3 player scenario (and also the draft rules), still long though.

Rating is based on a few plays of the Avalon Hill version.  I haven't been able, thus far, to figure out how to get my various cultures to cooperate to maximize my victory points and minimize my opponents'.  I consider this an heavier game due to its length and the need to plan ahead and take a lot of factors into consideration when playing.  Won't see much play time, due to length.

RATING: 2
Works better as an interactive historical simulation than an actual board game. To guide the game towards historical accuracy it depends on scripted events and defined scoring areas. SO there's not much to do other than what the game tells you you should do. It's like playing EL Grande where each player can only score in certain areas or Caylus where each player's path to victory is pre-defined ("you build in castle, you build buildings, you use the favor track"). I might be more tolerant of this sort of gameplay in a shorter game, but Britannia can drag on for 4+ hours. It's just not for me...

RATING: 8
Britannia es un juego de simulación histórica que recorre unos 1000 años de enfrentamientos entre un total de 17 culturas en la isla de Inglaterra y aledaños. Comienza con la invasión de los romanos y llega hasta la invasión normanda.  Las 17 culturas están divididas en cuatro colores (a pesar de lo que diga la caja y el reglamento, el juego es unicamente para cuatro jugadores). Cada jugador controla cuatro pueblos (excepto el amarillo que controla cinco). La partida dura 16 turnos. En cada turno suceden eventos (llegan refuerzos o surgen nuevas culturas). Con cada pueblo se va puntuando en función de los objetivos que dicho pueblo tenga marcados. Cada jugador tiene una cultura con la que consigue momentos de esplendor. Es un juego bastante entretenido y con chicha. No he jugado lo suficiente para juzgar sobre la rejugabilidad del Britannia (al estar muy marcado el desarrollo del juego por la tabla de turnos podría haber problemas al respecto). En todo caso, es un juego que recomiendo conocer.

Call me crazy, but I prefer the AH edition.  the FFG edition has interesting changes, but I think they make the game longer and there is less differentiation of the different nations - mainly due to re-using the same counter art for different nations and not having the nation names on the counters.  I really like the round nation counters, and prefer the "original" Roman rules.  And the "four corners" was the way I grew up playing and it was hard to see it changed in the FFG edition.

This is the game I most want to play when I'm not playing, but whenever I do get to play it tends to run so long I get tired of it.  If I could play against 3 other experienced and relatively quick-moving players I'll bet the experience would bump this up to a 9 for sure.

You don't know who wins until the game has finished and all the points are count. You have to try to get so many points as possible, but you can only get points at surten game turns.

RATING: 7
Another game that has aged badly. Not a bad underlying system, neat historical perspective, but this really is a 2-3hr game tops. Britannia weighs in at *much* longer than that, longer even than History of the World. The scripted nations and victory points are a boon for game balance; although it's still a whack-the-leader game, the opacity of the scoring helps a little bit. Unfortunately, it's also a killer for replayability, with games rapidly becoming pretty samey. Competitive play is pretty popular apparently, and I think that makes sense - there is a lot of scope for little optimizations, but the fact that it's an overall railroad-job prevents things from getting out of hand and lets things stay competitive (interestingly, War of the Ring fits this same pattern, although the cooercion is implicit rather than explicit).

Ultimately, the length issue is the killer. The other issues would be comparatively minor, and balanced by the nice historical flavor, if only it could be played in 4 hours out of the box.

I own the modern FFG version. Never played the AH version back in the day because I wasn't all that interested in the time period. Was it this fun twenty years ago?

Admirable in concept, and stunning components in the latest version, but way too long.  Becomes little more than a grating accounting excercise with experienced players.

A fantastic tour de force through British history. Simple and effective rules.

However, it's (as one might call it) scripted nature may not be for everyone. Equally, it is a long game. I don't regard that as a flaw, since we're not talking here of a downtime or convoluted rules issue. But it does mean it's tough to pull out within my gaming circle.

Comparing it to a somewhat similar game, History of the World, I must say it is infinitely better. In HotW, the various peoples just fly by and have little character. Hardly a satisfactory history experience. In Britannia, however, you are really championing the cause of a people and really feel you're duking it out in Britain, rather than simply on a board. 

As said, not for everyone. But certainly for me. :)

Classic assymetric game. Great history lesson with fairly straight forward rules though many exceptions to remember. Feels scripted due to the points awarded for historical goals but I like how everyone gets to launch a major invasion at different times and some tribes/peoples will survive through the entire game. It is quite well balanced but after three games I think the two easiest sides to play are the reds (Brigantes, Irish, Saxons, Norsemen) and blues (Picts, Belgae, Angles, Normans).

FFG version: Are the components really supposed to fit in the strangely shaped insert? What's with all the hexagons and triangles? This was the first insert I had to chuck out because it really served no purpose other than to take up space.

Have never come close to finishing this. Hope to try it again someday.  No doubt it would be most fun with a group of noobs who did not pay attention to other people's victory cards, and just ran their own nations.

Have no interest in playing this with people who are concerned with doing X on turn Y with nation Z to prepare for the arrival of nation W five turns in the future.  Hard to imagine anything less atmospheric than medieval people who know the future.

1 play (4p); I was the Bluevillians and despite severe Roman pummeling, surged into the azure.  I think I like Britannia better than History of the World; the semi-scripted play seemed to guide it toward play balance. I didn't think the choices were totally scripted; rather, it was pushing and motivating in certain ways that were not always pinned down. While WotW is so very beautiful, maybe one of the most beautiful games in a playable manifestation, this game does have excellent components. It was a bit on the long side (close to 5 hrs) but it was a learning game. The fast turn flow made it feel lively the whole time. It's not going to be a favorite, but I like it.

Would be much higher, but it's loooong for what it tries to be. It's all set up to be a good games night game, and it is - it has everything. But I don't think you could finish a game in one sitting. 3-4 turns too long maybe...

Good game with simple rules recreating the invasions of Britain from Rome to the Normans.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fantastic game, marred only by its somewhat antiquarian cadence and some possible predictability over the course of several plays.  I think this is ultimately a better game than Vinci, Seven Ages, or even History of the World because it captures the essence of shifting power dynamics and the rising and falling of nations over time in a much more efficient way.  The game is really quite simple, but the strategies can be rather complex as it becomes necessary to coordinate your nations in such a way to maximize their potentials for scoring.  I think that's a good thing, but with slower players it can be a nightmare.  If the game played in 3 hours consistently, I would rate it a 9 but for the type of game it is, 4-5 hours can be a little long.  4 players _only!_

My rating is based on a single play with two other players. We only played the short scenario, ending when the Romans pull out of Britain. It's a bit of a dicefest, and I get the feeling the full game might be a little too long for the type of mechanics it has. We shall see.March 16, 2008 -- I like the concept. I like the changing nations. I like the feel of playing out 1000 years of history. I think there is an interesting balance between the nations and players. However, the entire game falls flat for me because of the dicefest nature of the mechanics. Battles slow everything down and are far too reliant on getting a lucky roll. Reduced rating from 7/10 to 6/10.

Also, it looks like it's easy for some people to have to sit out many turns if the dice go against them and they loose their main nations. I would give the gameplay itself 7, but I bumped my rating up to 9 because I enjoyed the history lesson so much.

Willing to sell - make me a reasonable offer.

Since we play every 3 years or so the preperation and
learning curve is somewhat long. Played for 5 1/2 hours
in one sitting. 1/2 hour refresh rules + 1 hour rereading
all the fine details in the rule book. Those romans have
a lot of special rules that takes time to digest. This
game is certainly very well made ,but would suggest playing on a weekend instead of cramming it into one
evening session. Alot of the appeal lies in discussing the historical signifigance of the different nations and
comparing previous scores achieved.This game should not
be stressfully played. Take time and enjoy the historical
ride.

I love the historical reenactment part of this game.  It is kind of confusing at first, but once you get used to the system, it can be quite enjoyable.  It shouldn't be played very often though simply for the fact that similar scenarios and situations tend to arise game after game and as such, the game doesn't have many upsets.

(Used Avalon Hill edition)

A big game of big swings.  Can be tough to stay focused the entire time if you're in a downward stroke of your personal pendulum, especially if someone else decides to target your weakly remaining presence.  Another game likely to improve immensely with repeat play, but I'm not sure how easy it will be to play regularly.  Luckily there is at least one other player fanatical about it at the moment.

Poor scaling, which I always see as somewhat of a shame, but I'm not sure how it could have been resolved given the game narrative.

My one concern is that the game has heavy constraints on where a particular tribe can go (and still score points) and I think I might prefer the system in a less restrictive environment.

Review based on original edition (I don't have the FFG edition). A series of historical invasions showing the war for supremacy of England in Medieval times, which doesn't make the table often due to its long game-time. The purple player is virtually guaranteed to not win unless the Romans manage to drive forward all the way to the North as well as take Wales. Never played the newer version to see if they fixed that.

Not many plays to base this on yet, but what a blast it's been so far.
Our learning game took nearly 6 hours, but not one player became bored or noticed any downtime.  Controlling multiple nations means you can get hosed early on but still have plenty to play for when your next nation turns up, even if you can't play for the win you can go for a nation highest score. Every game tells a story...

Awesome light war game.  I love the ebb and flow for each player as their nations come into play.  It's a fairly scripted game as nations come in at specific times but there's enough room to experiment and enough incentive to push yourself to get the hard-to-earn points that I don't think any two games will play exactly the same.

EDIT: Yep, it's a 10.

Wouldn&#039;t it be faster just to crunch the numbers, and reduce the entire game down to a single die roll?  I&#039;ll step into a general&#039;s shoes, but this game is more like a straightjacket.

First play today (10/6/2007) - what a stroke of genius this game is! It's much like "History of the World" (or perhaps more accurately, HOTW is much like this, as I believe Brit was the original), but with more historical flavor, and of course, it's focus is more narrow - Great Britain from 46 AD to 1085 AD. Each "nation" (Pict, Roman, Norman, ...etc) scores points in ways that encourage historical actions by those nations. The 4 player game took 5 hours for our first play, so I would think an experienced crew could play it under 4. Highly recommended!

This sure is one long game.  It keeps my interest though...very fun!

At first I was a little put off by the scripted nature imposed by the scoring mechanism.  However, there is quite a bit of variation from game to game b/c several tribes are often fighting for the same dirt.  With the dice sewing a bit of chaos, you can't count on anything in this game.  However, given the number of tribes that one player controls, you have a chance to mitigate the dice chaos.  The interplay between the tribes is just very exciting.  Trying to evaluate how well a player is doing is raised to an art form.  This keeps the game from being a leaderbashfest, since players don't always have the same idea of just who the leader is.  I guess what I'm saying is that this is a game of contradictions that leads to a very satisfying, if a bit bewildering, experience.

RATING: 9
My rating is for the Avalon Hill version published in 1987. The FFG edition gets a 7 (see below). I played the first edition many, many times. Lots of fun. Straightforward, simple mechanics. Slight disadvantage for Green player. On the downside, the 3 and 5 player variants are pretty awful.

The second edition incorporates a map change (Cumbria and Lothian are now adjacent) which I think improves the geographical situation, but makes just about everything else worse. The burnt yellow map is loud. The counters that lack the names on them (very silly omission) making identification a pain and confusion common, especially when you're calculating population growth and/or figuring out Bretwalda or King votes. The lack of counters to indicate raiders vs invaders is annoying. Using yellow (?!) instead of purple for the Roman player is bizarre. The lack of counters to indicate which areas have already been covered for various racial VP collection is again annoying. The lack of population restrictions between major invasion turns that lead to some wonky mid-invasion stacking. And so on.

I'm not sure about the overall VP situation, but it was clear that Green had a slight disadvantage in the old game. This seems to have been addressed, but the Yellow/Roman player is now in the same boat as a result of other changes, so I'm pretty sure the overall balance isn't there. To wit, in most of the game reports, red or green is winning, and often by quite a large margin.

Given the choice, I'd rather play the AH edition and just declare Cumbria and Lothian are adjacent.

[November 2016 - 6.3]
I really like the unique gameplay in Britannia in that it's not just another war game. The high asymmetry provides natural swings in the game, giving everyone the chance to have their moments. That being said, it's also a game where you really need to study and know your factions to maximize points. Because of that, you feel that you're being forced to play a certain strict way, and if you get off that track and miss a big scoring chance, then you're pretty much done. For what tends to be a pretty long game, it isn't very satisfying and it feels more like the game is playing you.

Only redeemable part is the cool history aspect.  Vinci does the waves of respawning better by being balanced for each nation.  Game of Thrones does the nation conquering better by having cards instead of the ridiculously stupid dice fighting mechanic.  When some nations' entire success hinges on a single roll of three dice, you just can't use the "luck averages out" excuse for dice in wargames.  Also, the heavily scripted nature of the scoring system makes every game nearly the same.  Only the Romans have any freedom of what to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very similar to History of the World and Vinci in that you have a nation you play.  They eventually stop receiving reinforcements and begin to give way to more modern nations.  Periodically in the game you score for the territory you have.

It is a bit scripted and long but is a lot of fun.  Yellow jumps out to an early lead with the Romans.  Green lags behind and scores a lot of steady points...scoring big at the end.  Glad I finally got a chance to play!

Different multiplayer game where players play several independant tribes/factions and attempt to maximise the points earned by achieving historical goals.  Simple movement and combat rules, but tons of chrome and information to track.  A history lesson in a box.  The so-so Maharaja and the superb Chariot Lords are based on this game.  New version by Fantasy Flight - plays well, about 95% of the old Avalon Hill version exists.  New stuff includes Saxon villages; raiders are not forced back to sea to score their points, they can stay if they want; Belgae can submit but then auto-unsubmit for Boudicca; very nice new graphics; etc.

My rating for Brit creeps upward as we get better at playing quickly (4-5hrs). The asymmetric nature and multiple tribes per player is really cool, and I'm seeing very different strategies emerge in email games. Friendly discussions with Dr Pulsipher on the 'geek add to uniqueness and historical appeal of the game.

Downside is that we often need newbies to play a full game, and said newbies can skew the game with shortsighted moves

RATING: 7.5
The fine map illustrates the whole of Britain and coasts of Ireland and France. The 6 pages rulebook has easy and clear rules and allow you to simulate in an abstract way the invading waves of migrations to Britain from 45AD to 1085AD, from the Roman invasions to the Norman conquest. The counters include: army units, cavalry (Romano-British & Normans), leaders and Roman Forts. At the start of each game turn players place pieces as listed on their turn record chart, invading from the appropriate sea areas. They try to expand their nation and gather victory points. The player with the largest number of victory points at the end of the game wins. Although a light wargame, it manages to  keep your interest as every new match is different from a previous one.

Great game allowing players to experience 1000 years of tribal invasions and conquests of Britain.

Played Britannia twice.

I found Britannia to be very similar to History of the World. Same kind of mechanic as History of the World, Maharaja (Avalon Hill edition), and Chariot Lords for example. 

You really have to  know the different objectives of each nation to have no downtime while playing Britannia. So games with newbies will take longer compare with experience players a whole lot more compare to your average euro game. 

Each objectives in the game gives you bonuses or points. They are different for all players. Each player controls 4-5 different nations which comes in play in specific turn in the game.

The new version by Fantasy Flight games has to be commended as being the most perfect edition up to date. For the first time the rules really get it right, and the (minor) tweaks by Mr. Pulsipher really shine and make the game seem fresh even for veteran players like me. The board and the counters are of top quality as well, although the VP's as "change" doesn't really work, but nobody is kept from simply writing the scores down as it was done before. Yes, there is dice rolling, yes, the events are scripted, but there is also lots of strategy involved, and the more skilled player who plans ahead and saves his men for the really important battles usually wins. "Ancient Conquest" might have come first, but it is to the credit of Lew Pulsipher that we have a great classic "simple" wargame with immense flair that is still enjoyable after all these years.

A lot of interesting history compressed into a reasonably lengthy game.  Many players question the balance of the game, especially with other than four players.  The game requires a fair amount of dice rolling, and ill luck can sometimes frustrate the best laid plans.  

Those with a special interest in English/Scottish/Welsh history or a greater tolerance for a long game should probably add one to my rating of 7.25 on that count alone.  

Note: IMHO game play is reasonably balanced with four players, but has serious defects with three.

I enjoyed playing this, but it is a very fiddley game.  Each player has four or five different groups to keep track of, each with its own special abilities and exceptions.  It is NOT easier to play than games like Axis & Allies, due to these exceptions, though movement and combat are very simple.  I would enjoy giving this another run, but ONLY with FOUR players.  Based on our experience I think any other number would not go over well.  Kind of like trying to play Diplomacy with 6 people.  The artwork is very nice, I'd buy it just to hang the map on a wall.

Pros:  great components, playing different nations and each plays differently, battle mechanics & leaders are well done.

2nd play was better. Maybe a 7.5 when not playing green. Playing green is a 6.

Really well done as a theme, and a great game with competetive players. That said it is another Risk-like dice game with a long playing time and simple battle mechanics. A very heavy sense of pile-on the leader seems required as each age progresses.

Don't play it with kingmaker, defeatist, or bully personalities.

Vale que lo de llevar la cuenta de los puntos de victoria se atasca un poco con tantos territorios y  naciones...¡pero es que es la salsa del juego!. Distintas naciones con un mismo territorio objetivo en común = leña constante. La estrategia es determinante: cortar retiradas, aislar territorios, maniobras de distracción...

-----

The scoring system, based mainly on territories occupation or control, is a bit messy, but it is the heart of the game, a few plays and you will dominate it. 
Different factions have same goals, so there is combat everywhere and everytime. Strategy is determinant: you can round up the enemy so he can not retreat, do  diversion movements in order to hide your strategy....

I think to really have "fun" playing this game you need a dedicated group of players who are willing to spend the time with it. 

I don't have the desire to find that group or be a part of it. If you're into history and long strategic games this might be for you. For me, the mechanics just aren't exciting enough to play this for 4-6 hours.

Traded with Dave.  One of the earliest games I purchased based on the request from my husband.  Upon reading the rules he became so irritated that is as far as we got.  My rating therefore is based not on play, but on the fact we couldn't even get it out of the box.  Because of my husbands's response, the game fell flat with me too.  However, he is not a gamer & I am, and I would very much like to try this game with someone who wants to play.  More than likely my rating would advance.

One ot that games where you really learn History at the same time that enjoys a great game of conquest. Easy rules for a strategic game. 

It only works fine with four players us the tokens came in four colours. 

The problem use to be the great roman power and the big ammount of points they do. If you do not play the hole game some player can see that his "big" tribes do not come to play and it's impossible win in that situation.

You need at least 5 hours for finish the game.

A quite simple wargame with a lot of particular traits for each nation involved (each player has four of them, and each one gets VP in a particular way). It's a bit hard to manage and know other players priorities. Combat systems are usually from the Neolithic. It has somehow some chrome, though. But downtime between players is a down.

Only played twice I think but we did have a lot of fun. It's pretty brutal and there's not much else to do but to punch whoever your neighbour is, but you have to do it with great care and forethought and the whole thing is really gripping. I had the Romans and it was really hard and  euphoric at the same time (they're extremely powerful but everybody is against them and they lay buildings that give points to the other players when destroyed). I know people find it too scripted sometimes but it wasn't really how we felt (I mean it is a bit scripted certainly in how the victory points are earned but it was ok to us we still felt in control). Would love to play it again.

A good medium wargame with lots to look at and think about.  As a result this game runs very long.  We played with 4 fast people and we finished in 4.5 hours.  I don't think we could do much better than 4 hours next time.

But each player gets to be the big dog once in the game and you get points by taking certain territories and/or killing certain people.  A fun game with lots of potential, just make sure you are all ready for a 5 hour game.

RATING: 7
A classic which just takes a little too long to fit into a typical evening's play. There's undoubtedly an extent to which the luck of the dice can be a bit too much - it doesn't always level out over the course of the game.
The modifications in the latest (FFG) edition sound very interesting, especially the Roman roads and the incorporation of Boudicca's revolt, but it seems just a little too extravagant to get when I already have the older (Gibson's) edition.
As a side-note, this is one of those games which can be argued to be genuinely educational.

A solid game about the various invasions of Britain. The mechanics are similar to those of history of the world where each player controls several different powers that invade at various turns during the game. The theme in this one is very rich making it the best of they type of game. I found it long winded for what it was, and I'm not one to shy away from long games. A fun game but not one I plan on playing unless other people are hell bent on it.

Difficult to locate this game's genre placement among the modern options. It would be a pretty limited and uninteresting wargame, a too luck-dependent euro, a too long and deterministic AT, and a too stuck on history Eklundgame.

RATING: 7
A genre-busting game of epic sweep, reflecting the migrations and conflicts of various tribes/groups within the British Isles over the first millenium A.D. Perhaps you could call it a wargame, although it's delightfully different than most games that receive that moniker.  Britannia tends to be somewhat self-balancing among veteran players, who will know which tribes need to be bashed and when.  Not the most ergonomic game, because of all the various schedules and scoring conditions for the different tribes (and you really need to be familiar with all of it in order to play your best game).

This is one of the better rise and fall civilization games out there. The history presented in the game is fascinating and the game play is nice, albeit feels a little dated.

There are some drawbacks though and the biggest is that you have to play it a few times to really get a feel for the game. The game has a strong kingmaker element and is highly asymmetric which in itself is interesting, but prohibit new players to make a good judgment of how the game plays out. That, in combination that the game is rather long requires you to have a pretty focused group to get this game a fair chance. It is definitely a lifestyle type of game.

FFG edition. Played once. Theme was right up my alley and I enjoyed it enough to acquire a cheap copy for myself. I need to play again to get a clearer opinion. I'm not sure that all my friends enjoyed it, so I'm not sure if and when a replay will happen.

Edit: Replayed a couple of times solo, which works because there's no hidden information. A fun historical narrative for me but I could see why players might not like it. There's no strong identification with nations, the massing of victory points lacks a feel of an historical goal and it's full of easily overlooked exceptions, which also makes it difficult for any but very experienced players to play well. Probably not one I'm likely to get to the table with others very often but still happy to play it myself.

Fantasy Flight: Nice Game. The Ebb and Flow of British history balanced so nicely in the simple but choice full battles. Luck has a part but I think is evened out naturally and through the choices you make. The Nations' objectives allow freedom but keep the historical aspect focused and discouraged unecessary 'tactics.' One 'criticism' is that having played the Romans with things not going well for me made the game a looonnng one!

Edit: Haven't changed my rating but I'm not sure I'll look to play this again; had far too much trouble from those dice!

great history, fun game. while some colors are more favored than others, we track scores for each race so that there are some individual honors after the game.  

requires 4 players to work; there are 3 and 5 player variants, but I really would not bother.

rating, once a 10, is dropping due to the fact that the factions are dramatically unbalanced.  Green and Red have substantially better chances of winning than Blue and Yellow.  Bidding kind of corrects for that, so I'll leave it at 8 for now.

RATING: N/A
I'm not going to rate it yet because all I've had is one incomplete play. However, based on that one partial play (to the end of Round VII) I think the game is overly complex and too scripted. 

I'm probably missing something so far that further plays may uncover, but it seems that the game is likely to play out pretty similarly each time and that certain of the tribes/nations really do end up doing too much during the game. I like historical accuracy as much as the next guy, but this game seems to rely on it too much and ends up constraining the game play. 

From opening the box, through reading the rules, to playing a four man game to round VII, it took around 5 hours. I know that's because of the learning curve and constant referals back to the rules, but it would have taken another 4-5 hours to finish the game. Too long. And at this point I am pretty certain I will have a very hard time convincing the same group of people to give it another try. We'll see.

In the meantime I will be reading up on the game here on bgg to see what I can glean about the things in this game that I didn't quite get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a hard game for me to rate, so bear with me. I enjoyed my first game tremendously; it is a very, very well-designed game; I am extremely glad I played; but I don't know if I ever care to play again. It's too long, has too many exceptions, but succeeds admirably as a semi-scripted series of "what if" historical counter-factuals. There are other wargames, however, I'd rather play in much less time.

Requires precisely 4 players according to the BGG community. Very long play time and the design feels abstract because the game covers a thousand years and lacks a device like substantial era-specific card decks. Lots of dice rolling for a grand strategy game.

Sort of advanced risk but, set specifically in Britain dealing with the invasions of Rome right the way down to the Norman Conquest. It's a long game but, the game system is such that you are never knocked out as each period brings you another tribe/power to play. You'll probably learn a little history on the way! Epic! Have recently bought the new version. Some really neat changes; Roman Road movement and Boudican Revolt really change things for the Roman player...a lot harder to keep the limes forts from being burnt to the ground! Production is absolutely superb, well worth getting a copy.

RATING: 3
The brilliant parts of this design are outweighed by the shortcomings, most of which are rectified by other games that implement similar systems.

The brilliant part is the surge and decline nature as you control a variety of nations across the map that often have quiet different victory conditions. The downside can basically be summed up as: This game takes 4--7 hours to play and I'm not sure it is more fun or interesting than a game of Small World that takes 60 minutes. I feel like Small World has streamlined this down to a vastly more enjoyable package.

About the only unalloyed positive over Small World is the theme: the empires that rise and fall in Britain over 1000 years. Unfortunately it achieves most of this through the most railroad-y historical re-enactment driven set of victory conditions you'll ever see. Even traditional wargamers should be a bit chagrined by the design. e.g. things like the Welsh getting loads of VP for York (but not, say Cumbria) or the way the Norsemen don't care about Galloway but go after Cumbria.

Let me try a succint list of all the things that subtract from the fun of the game:

- It is quite long. Experienced players might get a game in 3-4 hours but it will be the rare group that plays this often enough to get to that point. The length seems a bit arbitrary given there is no real narrative arc, just lots of mini-arcs. [Small World doesn't take more than 60 minutes, even with new players.]

- In order to play half-decently you need to have a tremendous grasp of not only the victory conditions of your 4 nations but also the victory conditions of the other 12 as well as the special events coming up in the next turn or two. i.e. you need to realise that the Danes will be coming from the east so you either need to heavily defend York or assume it won't be part of your Saxon empire in three turns. This is quite a lot of take in and was frankly overwhelming. The result is bound to be very suboptimal play for the first several (long) plays. [Small World cuts down on the number of other players victory conditions you need to worry about.]

- You have no choice over which nations you play. There's no possibility to team up the Welsh and the Danes, for instance. [Small World allows drafting of races by the players.]

- The Romans aside, all of the nations play identically. [Small World is famous here for its variable powers.]

- Combat resolution can be both extremely-luck driven (there are so few rolls for a nation that things don't have a chance to "average out" before you've been crippled) and quite tedious (there will often be stretches of people re-rolling trying to be the first to get a 5-6 or a 6; maybe others find this tension-filled but I didn't). [Small World has a simple non-dice method of resolution that speeds things up quite a bit.]

- The scripting of things is quite dramatic: about 1/8th of the board is simply the list of events: This turn the Irish are raiding, next turn they are simply invading.

- The hard-coded victory conditions offer little scope for dynamic play. There is just never going to be a game where the Brigantes abandon their home province, whereas the Norsemen have no incentive to attack the east coast. Now, there may be second-order strategies where this isn't the case (maybe sacrificing the Norsemen to act as a shield against the Danes results in the Brigantes scoring more than they would otherwise) but I personally find it hard to take wild risks like that in quite long games because of the possibility that I'll end up crippled. Especially since I am not likely to play this enough (exactly four people for an entire night till midnight) to see the strategy unfold multiple times.

- The ebb and the flow of the game seemed a bit off for some of the players as they sit tight and wait for their next good nation to come along. Given that the "ebb" can last for >1 hour due to the length of the overall game that seems unfortunate and leads to disengagement.

Overall the game introduces some great concepts that are all (except for the Britain theme) done better elsewhere. A Brief History of the World offers less railroading and Small World feels like 90% of the fun condensed down into a streamlined 15% of the time package.

I used to love this game four player. Red seemed the most powerful but everyone had a chance. Until the Purples started using the Romans to trash the Picts. This establishes the Scots giving the Purples a great chance of winning. But it trashes Blues game and helps the Reds as it distracts the Angles. Red or Purple won nearly all games after this 'strategy' was adopted and so the game stopped being played.

RATING: 3
3-ast adtam a játékra de ez egy kompromisszum. Én nekem ennyit sem ért meg a játék, de valószínűleg igazságtalan a játékkal szemben. Ez egy wargame én pedig eurogame rajongó vagyok, tehát ezért is az alacsony pontszám.

A játékban népekkel játszunk, hogy Angliát meghódítsuk. Én a piros népekkel voltam, értettem, hogy milyen taktikát kell követnem velük, fölényesen nyertem is, de ettől még untam a játékot. 

A játék egyetlen előnye - valószínűleg - a történelmi hűség, azaz megpróbálták jól lemodellezni, melyik nép mikor és honnan érkezett Angliába és milyen területeket foglalt el. De minden más a játék negatívuma:
- igazából csak négy fővel élvezetes
- hosszú játékmenet. Első játékunk 4 órás lett és gyakorlott játékosokkal sem megy sokkal 3 óra alá. 
- unalmas. Sok a holt idő, míg a többiek lépnek, csatáznak. Van olyan szituáció, amikor semmit nem csinálsz, csak erősödsz és várod, hogy nagyobb csapatod legyen. Volt olyan játékos, aki fordulókra kiesett a népeivel és csak később tért vissza.
- de leginkább a kockadobálás zavart. Azt mondják ez a hadi szerencsét jelenti. Szerintem egyszerűen hülyeség, az győz aki sok 5-öst és 6-ost dob. Semmivel sem tudod ellensúlyozni a rossz dobásokat. Órákon keresztül kockákat dobálni, köszönöm, de ebből nem kérek.

RATING: 5
This game (I own the FFG edition) was very long, and a bit too lucky for such a long game.  I thought it was difficult to track where people wanted to go and where they eventually would go since a few different civs come in strong and want to go exactly where you want to go on the same turn.  This leads to problems of planning well and makes it more of an exercise of playing just for the immediate gain and made the game unpleasant to others.  I wouldn't play again anytime soon, but might be convinced to play again with other people.

Britannia (2nd Edition - Avalon Hill)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An educational trip through early British history, even though the highly scripted nature of unit arrival and player objectives means that games differ only in detail. Very much a product of the era in which designers imagined that complex rules plus a long playing time equated with a good game, and the limit of one major power to each player means there are long periods of the game where you have little to do. Competent, but unlikely to get more than occasional play in the eurogame age.

This is really excellent. I played the old version years ago and liked it then. Got the FF copy and it sat on the shelf for ages. recently took it down and started pushing it around and thoroughly enjoyed it. Britannia has a lot of occasional rules with exceptions but this is necesssary for historical accuracy. I really don't mind the extra rules when there's a great reason for them. It's not quick but its really good

Fantasy Flight edition: Excellent, highly-entertaining four-player game on the invasions of Britain.  The game introduced the area-movement/programmed victory conditions system later seen in Maharaja and Chariot Lords.  With much better balance and a playing time about two hours shorter, this game is probably a superior ludic experience to Chariot Lords.  It is also very interesting to watch the various invasions of Britain unfold.  The one problem with this version of Britannia is that the historical narrative really breaks down in 1066, which is the most significant event portrayed by the game.  Historically, King Harold the Saxon marched north to defeat the Norwegians and then marched south to confront William at Hastings.  But in the game, the Saxons do not receive a double turn, so Harold can only do one or the other.  Even stranger, both the Norwegians and Normans do receive double turns!  The resulting game is a solid, fun, four-player contest that plays in a reasonable timeframe.  I just with the end-game's history weren't so unnecessarily shaky.

If I had a group committed to playing just this game, say, every second Friday, I would probably love it with all my heart. So would the group. Otherwise... well, there are many similar games that are easier to teach and that support two players (they also go easier on people who are playing for the first time). I do appreciate it, but - as it is - it's just gathering dust.

My copy is not shrinkwrapped and there are no dice (God knows why - they were never there, but you just need regular d6's) - but apart from that it is like new (never had a chance to play my copy - the chits are still in sprues). I hope it finds a better home.

Complicated risk-based game. It has wonderful theme with historical characters, invaders, raiders. Game is depended on dice rolling, as you can expect from a risk-based game, but still needs strategy and important decisions.

Ideal Players: 5

Description: Play a number of factions as Britan develops through history.

Pro: Different victory conditions for each faction spark historically appropriate conflicts. Multiple factions for each player ensure an interesting game if one is eliminated. Factions rising and falling over time create a wonderful epic feel.

Con: Dice combat makes the game somewhat random. Game feels very long. Lots of downtime while other players are taking their turns. Needs a deck to keep track of which faction's turn it is, since there are so many factions.

I love the subject material. I have always thought that early English history was facinating. So much went on. So many different European cultures were involved. Quite interesting. 

Played a 3 player game of the original Avalon Hill version and it didn't work out too well. I was the Roman player and at one point I controlled the Romano-British and the Saxons. There wasn't enough of a reason (not enough of a VP gain) for the Saxons to attack the Romano-British so I used them together and trounced the other two players. Come to think of it, I think that's what happened historically and in a game-sense maybe that is how it's supposed to be as well. Maybe later in the game I get trounced. It's possible since the Normans and Danes come into play towards the end of the game. I've seen updated and tournament rules online and maybe that would resolve some of the balance points also. I hear that this game is optimized for 4 players and can see why. I would say that if you use the standard AH rules, I wouldn't play this game unless there are 4 players or use revised rules. I haven't tried the Fantasy Flight version yet and maybe some of the balance issues were corrected there. There's a great game in their somewhere! Fun game though.

RATING: 10
Pure gold. Probably, the best 4-player game you can find out there. It needs skilled players to shine, but if you are able to play it with 4 even skilled people, you'll get a 4 hours game full of enjoyment and brilliant decissions to be made. I would play this game everyday if I had the chance.

Finally had a chance to play this after owning it for 5 months. The gameplay is pretty straight-forward. When you attack you hit on 5 or 6 unless you have a leader ( 1 to die roll) or are attacking Romans, Calvary or in difficult territory, then you hit on 6's. Different nations come into play at different points and all nations have seperate opjectives. That can get a little confusing, know not only what the individual objective on your nations (4-5 throughout the game) but also know all of your opponent's objectives too! Fun game, I can't wait to try it again.

That has to be the coolest boardgame tagline ever! Wished they keeped it in the new FFG version (which is the one that I have). I like this game's theme. A lot. The gameplay is fun, not too complicated (though it has a lot of exceptions), and it's really interesting to play the different people that enter and leave play at different moments.

***UPDATE***
After quite a few games, this one has really grown on me. There is no doubt this is my favorite "wargame". There seems to be so many different strategies, and each game is different and fun. My rating is now a "9".

The history of Britain from the first Roman conquest until 1066. I love this game! Close to perfect in my book, and I've played this many, many times. Some people dislike the strict scripting of the game, but this exactly what I like about it, and what makes it different from the multitude of beat-up-the-others games. However, the Britannia series of games work best with skilled players, since novices will have big problems determining who's in the lead, and might therefore be hitting on the bottom guy, while letting the leader get an easy victory.

Old but still good, captures the sweep of British history from the Romans to Normans at a broad-brush level.

Different players will be more or less involved in different stages of the game, and I wouldn't give the Romans to a first-time player.

Enjoyed a recent play very much (after a very long playoff measured in decades not years!) to the point of selling my of Gibsons edition and picking up the (relatively) recent FFG edition - printing and game production quality has moved on massively since the 1980s, and the rules and board have been streamlined somewhat.

Awesome representation of 1000 years of British history.  I love the point system whereby you get points for achieving historical objectives but also the freedom to do things differently and potentially end up with a better result.  (This game alone has given me a better overall understanding of British history than my schooling) The game is designed best for four players.  With four players, each player gets their turn in the limelight as one of their more powerful factions comes into play at a particular point in the timeline.  It can be hard to tell who is winning unless you have played before.  We like to make a note of what each people group typically gets so we have a better idea of who is exceeding expectations and also to keep a high score for fun.  The game still works reasonably well with three players; five players is not so good as there can be periods of history where little is happening for your people.  You need to devote most of the day to playing it after taking into account breaks for food and drink etc, but it's a real treat to do so.  The game artwork is great and the balance between chance and strategy is reasonable IMHO - especially since the timeline keeps pulling everything back towards history as new people groups enter play.  It can be annoying when new players don't understand the significance of the decisions they make with their early conquests and end up setting up an easy environment for another player.  However this can also create some interesting historical outcomes!

RATING: 7
Britannia's success is mediating the major shortcomings of multiplayer conflict games. The scripted peoples and their directed expansion by VP targets avoids the free-for-all pitfall. Bash-the-leader and kingmaking is mitigated by the intransparent scoring with some player's peoples scoring well early, others only in the final turns. It needs a lot of experience to gauge correctly who's done a good job which might make it a bit unfair when players target others based on wrongly perceived scores. Watching whom the dice have favored, helps. 

It's highly thematic - the Belgae, there to be wiped out and survive in a remote area for a few centuries, the Caledonians just hanging around on their islands not to be bothered until the Vikings come around. These guys are mostly out for raiding. The Jutes will make a short and inconsequential appearance, the Irish might stick around a bit more and be a PITA for the Welsh. As time has shown, the interplay variety is still high enough that the scripted nature isn't bothering. Though, some combinations might be more interesting to play than others. 

Still one of the finest multiplayer conflict games around although it has none of the fancy development trees, die roll modifications or different roads to victory. It also teaches a bit of British geography and history.

Mi primer "boardgame" de verdad. Me lo regalaron mis padres unas navidades, creo que tenía 13 o 14 años, porque no encontraron el D&D básico. Tengo la versión de AH y la nueva de FFG con mejores componentes (sobre todo el mapa) y reglas mejoradas. 

Es un juego exclusivamente para 4 jugadores. Es realmente interesante cuando los 4 conocen a fondo el juego.

Del orden de 25 partidas sin loguear.

Tengo también la edición de AH y el nº de The General con la expansión de Irlanda.

UPDATE: he vendido la edición de AH con la revista y me he quedado sólo con la edición de FFG.

A classic where all 4 players get to be ascendant at different times.  Not a game for those who have to be in the action every second or those who only play 1-2 hour games.  That being said, I find watching the rise and fall of the various factions in the game fascinating.

I played as the Green Team, Wales/Caledonians/Danes/Jutes. It was hopeless. The Picts kicked the Caledonians' asses early on and it took forever to build up the troops to even try to recover. Meanwhile, the Irish launched a full scale invasion of Wales right after it was still weak from the Roman attacks. I'm certain of one thing: I will never, ever, ever play as the Greens, ever again. 

More generally, though, I think this game is too delicately balanced and lends itself to kingmaking situations. I need to play more to get a broader idea of what strategic mistakes I made and whether I truly couldn't have done anything about them - it's a lot of fun, the mechanics are shockingly simple, and the historical elements are good for getting players to talk in funny accents.

This has been a must-play game every time I visit home and it almost wouldn't be a family holiday without a game of it at some point. Interesting gameplay both strategically and from a historical standpoint (you are rewarded for roughly following historical British invasions). Not so keen on the 3/5-player full-length games, but the shorter length scenarios are pretty well balanced.

I see the potential in this game. However IMHO you need to invest A LOT of time in this game, before it pays of. It'll take you a number of plays, before you're able to think out strategies and to begin with, it all seems very overwhelming.

Surprisingly well balanced.  Forces you to stay within historical events for each nation in order to win, but doing that well can be a challenge. 

It's a long game, longer than the box suggests (what we've found after 4 plays).

The only thing I really dislike is how many exceptions to the rules there are for the Romans which makes it difficult to remember how to play.  And just the number of special placement rules period is difficult.

I own the older AH edition.  This is a game I've been drawn to for years.  I played it back in the day, but never all that much.  The game is heavily scripted, which ought to bug - but somehow it doesn't.  I'm glad to own this game, even if it is unlikely it will ever get very many plays.

I also have the Irish expansion from AH.  Looks like a fun addition to the game.  (Not played yet.)

RATING: 6
AH Edition. This is one of the first book case games I bought, and the first second hand one -- got it from a bearded fellow at Lincon or Gothcon sometime in the late 80's.

The "programmed" approach to victory conditions, which makes the game somewhat inaccessible to new players, as well as the four player requirement means that this one hasn't hit the table for quite a few years now. Would like to play it again some time, though.

My game has got the expansion map from the General glued over Ireland.

This is Smallworld, except it takes 5 hours to play, is designed with 4 players in mind and has historic flavour instead of fantasy. This game actually is fun (if you like dice fests) but it is way too long for what it has to offer. There are no real decisions to make.

RATING: 7
FFG version - best with 4 players. Basically an improved Risk with victory point objectives, but although there is a lot of luck due to the dice, I like the historical simulation of the invasions into Britain by a whole range of other nations, from the Romans in 43BC to William the Conqueror in 1066.

Oh this game is a blast - such a historical feeling and realistic play you won´t find anywhere else. No game session is like the other, but all sessions remain in historical-logical terms - I LOVE it! The only bad thing that makes me rate it 9 instead of 10 - very often a tribe cannot score, even when it was well planned, simply because of bad dice luck.

Wargame hotorical, Britannia takes people towards the invasions of Great Britain troughout history,each players command a series of population and its only up to him their achievemnt in history and their persistence as well. The game is balanced for 4 people the ideal number,only the new edition of it has some kind of balanced redistribuition of population to pay it in 3 or 5 players...Anyway I recommend to play it in 4 to enjoy it fully.Some populations plays on luck some not luck is certanly present and you have choices,but normally you have binaries one:Do this or Do that.So if you like a more Free Wargame is better to go with something else(like Conquest of Nerath)but if you like a strong objective leaded wargame(you are leaded by objective in each epoch,each round) with a good historical theme take this without any reserve.

There are 2 interestings things that I noted about this game: 1) Victory through a victory point system, 2) the presence of invaders to destroy the kingdoms already there. Everything Else, I don't like it.

One thing for sure, I don't like too much historical games. But there is also the fact that there is several limitations that I don't like. For example, you cannot have more units that the number of tokens you have. It happened once that I produced 2 units per turn, with a lot of empty territories around, but expanding further gives me nothing, because all the units are in play. So I cannot build a strong kingdom to protect my self from the next invader.

The fact that each territory has VP values according to various factions, it makes it really annoying read all the faction sheets to know which territories are worth more for who. There is also the troop management rules which are pretty anoying to apply.

Finally, our game took 7 hours to play, after 5-6 hours, I was seriously starting to get bored, I wanted to end it as soon as I can. So I pushed players around to play faster.

A 20-turns history of the Ancient Britannia.  The Roman begins the invasion from the south, doing better than where Hitler failed.  Angles, Picts dominated the centre. Wales stand on the west coastal area, holding against the Roman invasion and supressing the tiny Irish moving from Ireland.  Up north Caledonian and Scots are relatively sheltered from the protected mountainous regions, except the Norseman occasional harass.  Dubliners landed on Cumbria to expel where the Irish settles in the endgame.  The Danes also sweeps the Saxon on the south and east coast.  Final game sees the Saxons wiped out by the mighty Norwegians and the Normans.  Final score:
Eric/Peter (Blues)119 points (30 scored on the last turn!);James (Greens)110 points (in the lead on the penultimate turn); Andrzej (Purples) 100 points (he was robbed) Lawrence/Ken (Reds) 98 points (dommed Saxons).

Interesting game. I like the fixed number of turns and the 'programmed' rise and fall of the different nations. Played it a couple of times and placed third, as the best result. I think you need a couple of plays under your belt, before you get the flow of the game overall. 

I would like a more clear indication of what is going to happen on the different turns; 2/3 of the game is knowing who will invade you next and when & from where

I am interested in History and this is a game that always increase my erge to learn more about this period in time.
This is a good game for 4 players although it does take a bit of time. Is best played with experienced players where you have some kind of auction bidding VPs to even out the advantages some colors have. Also by being experienced you know the goals for each color's nations which does influence other players. 
Have tried this as PBM as well and it works quite nicely, although it is harder to negotiate between players. And it is quite some work for the GM.

[Comments are for Avalon Hill version] A very nice game of the tribes and kingdoms of first millennium Britain.  The rules are simple, but the victory points are truly arcane; One of these days I&rsquo;ll upload the victory point maps I made, which make it easier to play.  A major downside to the game: After a bunch of plays, it seems that the strategies of most sides (and especially the Romans, who set the game&rsquo;s pace) are stereotyped.  And it does take quite a while to play.

Players have a color where different tribes that conquered Britain appear throughout the game.  Each color will have different times where you will be very strong and overrun players.  The map is interesting where highland areas are a bit more defensive than other locations.  

This will remind players of History of the World.  The downside is that you must have 4 players to play it.  And it is a long game where you are looking at 6 hours to play.

RATING: 5
After one game. I'm disappointed, even though I had high hopes I wouldn't be.

The idea behind the game is sound and felt like something I could really get behind, as I'm both a British Isles and History fan. Unfortunately, the game's mechanics are so primitive and random that it doesn't leave much gameplay in. EVERYTHING depends on dice rolls. There are no cards, no special in-combat abilities (apart from the Leaders, and that's not much), and generally nothing in the player's choices which helps battle that sheer randomness.

Also, it's way too long for what it is. It gives the illusion that your choices matter - they do, to some extent, but not as much as you'd think. Because at the end of the day, it's down to the dice, and it's a total crapshoot.

I will give it another go, but unless there's a different mechanic somewhere, I doubt I'll place this game on the table much, as it amounts to a five hour long session of throwing dice around hoping they'll work in your favour. I've got different, much shorter games like that.

RATING: 7
A great game that I played quite a bit in my younger years.  I really enjoyed the sweep of history that the game portrays.  If you like History of the World, then you should give this a try (and vice versa).  Takes a fair commitment of time to play.  I would say that it pretty much requires that all have played before and know the rules in order for it to be fun.  This is because there is a fair amount of play-balancing that is done by the players during the game to keep the leader in check.  This would rank higher, but for the learning curve and time commitment required to play.

Excellent game especially for turnment 4 player game.

I love the earlier Avalon Hill game and regret to have bought only the more recent game from Fantasy Flight Games. 
A lot of nice counters, but forgetting to write the name of the tribe on the counter itself is worse than a fault, it makes you lose what is the more important in the game. One does not attack the unit in blue but the Normans and that is all but lost when you do not write it on the counter. Not much adavantage to have additionnal units.

Played it a lot in my school years and 4 players is best.

Really fun semi-abstract representation of the settling of Great Britain.  Super simple rules makes for a compelling wargame system.  Despite the victory conditions being the same for each group, no two games are alike.

The big downside to getting this on the table is its length. Other than that, however, it's a great game. Playing different peoples in the same color is a true challenge. There is a lot of forward thinking that goes on here as you anticipate who and what is coming down the road. It's a pretty good overview, too, of the historical development of Britain through 1066, although it can differ greatly!

2015-08: traded in big trade

I loved this game in the late 80s/early 90s. The sweep of history of the British Isles from Rome to the Norman Conquest, with all those different races? I absolutely love that. But it's a game that takes 4hrs plus to play, and randomness can devastate you. Yes, you'll have something to do with all your future nations, but do poorly enough up front with the Romans or Saxons and you have no hope of winning. 

Nowadays I'd far rather play SmallWorld for some of the same vibe without the random, and then play a couple more games after that.

But it's still much better than Maharaja, the India version.

RATING: 7.5
Good four players wargame that recreates the invasions and expansions of the different historical tribes in Britain. There are some historical objectives for each tribe that each player has to accomplish. There is enough margin for each on the how to accomplish the objectives to not feel that the game is scripted.
Each player manage four different tribes at different times of the history. Given the armies available plus the reinforcements, you will have to decide when and how to expand to the other areas of the map in order to achieve what the tribe is supposed to achieve.

Haven't played this for years, but it was always good for a more 'serious' gaming session. I particularly like the way the tribes come & go - one player can't really be trapped out of the game, as there will be another race/tribe for them to introduce as the game progresses. We consistently found this was better with one fewer than the maximum number of players. I have the Avalon Hill edition.

Rating based on the german WDS edition. I have very fond memories of play with my old group of gaming buddies. Coolest occasion was one of the tribes resisting roman occupation ridiculously long - ruining the roman players well laid out plans - he didn't need the space at all, but got carried away, eventually costing him the game...

A great light game of invasions set in England.  This is not too serious fare, but it is fun.  Compare to Vinci or History of the World, but less chaotic than Vinci and more focused than History of the World.  It is a bit long for a simple, fun game, but sometimes that works fine!

04/06/94 Received. I own the 1987 Avalon Hill edition. A great game, though its hard to get a session together very often since it takes over four hours, even with experienced players. 
As of 03/13/16 I have also played the 2006 Fantasy Flight four times. 
Overall the 2006 FFG edition is best. But there are some things I liked better in my 1987 AH edition. 
1. The names of each nation are printed on the counters (instead of, for example, trying to remember who is a "spear" and who is a "shield" in the 2006 edition). 
2. The counters were not back printed (which serves no purpose at all), allowing one to turn them over to show they'd already moved/attacked, etc.  

And one thing both did poorly. The 1987 edition has a green board and a green faction. And the 2006 edition has a yellow board and a yellow faction. Really? With all the colors in the rainbow to use and they did that, so that faction's pieces blend into the background?

Rating after only a single play.  The historical flare was nice, but the game play seemed a bit repetitive and dice-based combat games are not my favorite. I did like the various, different goals for each nation, which helped keep one focused.

I actually never played britania but I played a britania-like game set in ancient greece(dont remember the name of that game.) But given that the similarities are strong enough I think this rating is fair. I dont like historical games that forces me to play historcally if I want to win. I want to be able to change history or at least I want to play a game where my decisions are less scripted.

Long-winded, but highly thematical experience. Despite the seemingly scripted nature, there is huge variation in the game as a single strategic or tactical player decision can have enormous effects significant amounts of turns later in the game. If there ever was a butterfly effect, it's in this game.
Incredibly fun though, but too heavy to grab from the shelf every week.

Beautiful components, as is usual with FFG. Nicely thought out game that seems to have been thoroughly playtested. A different game in both scale and feel from History of the World -- and enjoyable for it. Rating is based upon length - it does play a little long for what it is. Still, overall a nicely designed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably the best multi-player game I own or have ever played.  Each side gets multiple chances to wreak havoc across the board and a chance to be on the receiving end as well.  When it's your turn to unleash destruction you need to make a maximum effort and score as many points as possible because you're only on top for a little while.  The game doesn't seem to work as well with 3 or 5 players, but the four player game is tough to beat for gaming fun.

Good game, but best with 4 players.  I have played solo and with 2, and the game works, but its sometimes hard to keep track of everything.  I enjoy this game, and have added Rus with similar mechanisms to my collection.  Really had a great time my last couple plays with the full 4.  Last game finished in about five hours, so not too bad.

Nov 17: Periodically play this solo, and always fun.  Lots of dice rolling.  The goal cards for scoring make the decisions as a solo player more straightforward, so I don't even need the selective amnesia you often have to show as a solo gamer.

OK, average game, thus an average rating.  

Really didn't like the process of checking up on the reinforcement schedule for all opponents as part of the game/turn  analysis process.

I can see the game analysis becoming much easier with experience, but still, I'd really much rather play something else.  Unless all players are familiar with the impact of future reinforcement, too easy for inexperienced players to throw the game to another player.

History of the World, in my mind, is an improved version of Britannia.

I played only old edition (I don't like very much new edition graphics so I didn't buy a copy - I already have a copy of Gibson edition), so my comments refers only to old version of the game.

I like it very much:an excellent game who recreates the history of invasion of Britain until 1066. Every player handle a set of nation (whose counters have the same colour in 4-player game) who rise and fall during british history and scores points according to the goals his nations reach. The game require luck, as every dice-driven game do, and strategy to win. Best played in four. The differents sets of nations require different strategies and I think red player have a slightly better chanches to win.

RATING: 8
This thing is awesome, even though I got clobbered in the last game I played.  You could either say this is a game for Small World fans who want more strategy and depth and historical flair, or you could say Small World is a game for Britannia fans who don't want to have to think as much or don't have as much time on their hands.  This game WILL take hours to play, especially with new players. But with four people who already know how to play, you can expect to shave an hour or so off the play time.

One thing that is VERY IMPORTANT to keep in mind is the asymmetrical scoring that makes the game feel very unbalanced at certain points in the game.  One really must play the whole game out to the end because every game I have played came down to a close finish at the end.  In fact, I finished one game where the green player was grumbling all throughout the early to mid-game about how yellow was running away with it and he had no chance.  Green won in the end once their big invasion force came into play.  Like I said, you really have to play it out because it will be close.

My favorite 4 player game of all time. Extremely rich theme with a great game system. The player plays not 1 but 4 or 5 different powers who rise and decline during the course of the game. The situations change and evolve for the player as the game goes on. Thus they may start by fending off Roman invasion but then in the middle of the game start raiding the Scottish Coast to only end up fighting the Saxons for control of Southern England towards the end. 

In terms of the new Fantasy Flight edition, it's very much the same game as the original with only a few tweeks here and there. The components are fantastic with one of the nicest quality mapboards I've ever seen for a game.

Rating changed from 9.0 to 9.75, on 12/27/17.

Britannia, oh how I love thee so. A marathon to run through the history of the British Isles, from the Roman invasion to Norman invasion. Rules are well within the ability of players to learn as they play - from experience, the trick is to have an experienced player and/or the teaching player to be the yellow faction (to handle the Romans with all their special rules). 

The board is pleasing to the eye, but more importantly has a great deal of information encoded in the timeline flowing down the right side of the board. The pieces are easily used, clearly marked, and the game will see many replays in your life, if my experience is any indication.

Light (but long in German standards) war game about a period of thousand years from 40 to 1066 AD in Britannia, starting from the Roman invasion, ending with the Norman invasion. Dropped down to six - it would definitely require a certain mood to play.

Indifferent.

RATING: 7
Jury is still out, since the first and only play was of a two player scenario that we did not have time to complete. Seems to drag on for a long long time, and to be too reliant on dice rolls. If I had a choice, I'd rather be playing GoT or Warrior Knights. Still, I am willing to try this again with a bigger group of players.

====================

Update after second play. Having completed another game and seeing how close everything was, I can say that I really enjoyed this - reminded me of Small World only with depth and actual strategy and long term planning. Game time was still rather long, but it didn't really drag--if all the players play carefully, there is something for everyone to be thinking about and doing every turn. I suspect with four experienced players, things would really chug along and it might cut an hour off of the play time.

Interesting game, does take a long time.  There are some "bang for the buck" issues with the variable engagement for the different power collections (some players can get eliminated or have severe down time between getting their good people).

My kind of game!  Helps that I won by 100 points my first time out, which is akin to Robert James Waller winning the Pulitzer for Literature.  The rules are fairly simple, but with enough zing that there are real tactical choices to make.  It's a very long game, but that's expected.  The only question is about replay value, but I want to re-play it now, so that's a good sign.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting and dynamic variable-power game. Innovative scoring system (for its day) makes for some interesting decisions. Emerging invaders can see the scoring task unfolding before them as the game develops. Green player can be a bit boring, especially the Welsh. Unfortunately, a well-developed strategy can come apart with a few bad rolls of the dice, which reminds me a lot of Risk.  This is a game where the mechanics on their own are passable, but its combination with the theme makes it lots of fun. Its success is evident in its many descendents (eg History of the World, Hispania, Vinci, etc). Britannia would probably run too long to have any appeal to my gaming groups.

This game depicts the fascinating story of the invasions of Britannia, from the Romans to the Normans. By ruling several peoples, you will be able to strike different deals with different players and enjoy several "golden ages" during a game. This is also the game that really aroused my interest in history.  

Pros: Simple rules, all players participate to the end, variations throughout the game as different peoples enters the board, historical base
Cons: Chance important for outcome, knowledge of how to optimize different peoples gives unfair advantage to experienced players vs beginners

Maybe too random for some.  But I feel like I have some meaningful decisions to make, and (correctly or incorrectly) feel like they are having an impact on the outcome of the game.

Certainly not a great game, and certainly will not be to everyone's taste.  But I'm always happy to play this game, particularly with 4 players, which is clearly the best number of players for this game.

After some tries with Britannia and one final play of Italia i have realized i don't like Britannia-style games - to much special faction rules and knowledge about the ebb and flow of those rules during the course of the game needed to play properly (Can Oskar the Dane fly in turn 6 or only airdrop with his special elite guard?).

Such a fantastic game. Just don't try and play it with your 7 year old kid. Even if they really like history and playing armies. I don't know quite who this game could be for, really. It's not deep enough for committed play, but you need to be committed to get anything out of it, to really start to get to grips with its interesting systems. I guess it's interesting as a period piece but has been surpassed by later and cleaner, brighter games: Smallworld is probably its spiritual successor!

I really don’t feel like playing Britannia again. It’s not a simulation and it’s not a wargame but an area control game with typical euro mechanics. Combat is simple and uninteresting. The same goes for movement and victory conditions. The game is rather scripted and luck is a huge factor (this really, by the way, is a major problem). What’s worse, Britannia takes far too long to play for what it is. I’d rather play some real wargame or Smallworld instead.

RATING: 7
Molto simile ad Italia (di cui è il precursore) ne possiede pregi: fantastica ricostruzione storica con tentativo di riproporre i principali scontri di popoli e battaglie; e difetti: lungo, non immediato e difficile da governare se non si leggono accuratamente i propri obiettivi ma anche quelli degli avversari, il che rende le partite ancora più lunghe. Ha la particolarità di essere asimmetrico, ovvero con il giocatore in giallo (con le sue 4 popolazioni) decisamente più debole, accentratore di attenzioni, e attacchi, all'inizio per via del popolo romano ma nel proseguo del gioco molto debole. Mentre il popolo blu ha l'aria di essere il più potente per una costante buona presenza sul tabellone. Non male anche i popoli rossi e verdi che possono provare nell'impresa. Il gioco è chiaramente solo per 4 giocatori, e aver pubblicato sulla scatola la possibilità di giocare in 3 o 5 è una chiara (losca per la verità) operazione di marketing per vendere qualche copia in più.

Recommend this game to anyone looking for a conquest game with a chaotic environment with changing sides as the conflict progresses.

After a half dozen plays, starting with the first 2-player (learning) scenario, I had to rate this a "9".  

The design is excellent and Fantasy Flight's production is typically gorgeous. Before purchasing, I was intrigued by the long track record of this game, the production by Fantasy Flight, and that it's a highly-rated military-historical simulation of British history.  

Its length doesn't put me off at all, although I'll grant that setting up this game and playing through it is a big undertaking, one I'm not sure how many times I'd continue to pursue. 

It seems like one of those situations in which you take a time-tested game design and say, "Wouldn't it be cool if one of the leading game companies took this and re-did the design to contemporary standards?" and that's exactly what happened. The result is very satisfying.  

At the same time, when the rulebook says it is wise to take time to study the individual side's cards, they're not kidding: studying each side's order of battle and scoring-by-round information is crucial to success.  

Purchased Fantasy Flight version, new, on sale, at a local games store, in March of 2009.

This has grown into one of my all time favorites games. Unlike many euros and even some wargames, no two games are ever alike. Each game tells a epic story of the history of the Britain and it provides lots of memories. 

The only issue I have with it is that the yellow (Roman) player has too much downtime during the midgame.

RATING: 8
I Played several times at the AH edition a long time ago. I own a copy of the first FFG Edition.

Britannia is a fine game where you see centuries of history unfolding before your eyes: It's a very pleasant experience, but you'd better play with equally experienced gamers to avoid frustration, especially for the yellow faction! More than any other faction, the yellow one can be left behind by illogical behavior from inexperienced players. That is the only potential "balance" problem I can find in an already very refined game.

Still, even thought this second edition is better than the AH one, I wish Britannia could be a little bit closer to history : The Romans conquered most of Britain, not just submit the tribes by diplomacy. The Romano-British lasted longer and temporarily unified several nations (of different colors in the game) against the German invaders...

May be a future edition will allow this?

RATING: 9
Another absolute classic.  I'd actually rate the original version a "10" if it were available since it really does feel like almost the "perfect" 4 player war game.  Simple mechanics with minimal rules issues, and an amazing depth of options and strategies.

I enjoy the update as well, but can't give it the "10" for one simple reason - the addition of the Danish leader to the end game just seems to screw up the chances of anyone actually becoming King, which leaves me feeling a bit empty.  Where the AH version had some interesting tension around "do I shoot to eliminate the other two possibilities" for Harold/Harald/William, the new leader really seems to make any shot at getting the turn 16 kingship a longshot with far too much risk for the reward.

Still, when there are only four players at the table, odds are good this one's going to get played.  Also translates amazingly well to PBEM (which we've done a great deal of).

Un gioco appassionante con un'ambientazione eccezionale (l'Inghilterra è una seconda patria: dopotutto la mia generazione è cresciuta a pane e Defender of the Crown). Tutto bello: gli obiettivi che cambiano a seconda dei turni e delle civiltà giocate, la coperta sempre troppo corta, l'equilibrio rotto ogni turno a causa delle invasioni. Su tutte, l'idea di giocare più civiltà a testa, alcune separate nel tempo altre coeve, è geniale e permette di far entrare in scena tutti i popoli che calpestarono il suolo inglese in quei secoli, compresi i "piccoli" irlandesi e scozzesi, con le loro invasioni "a rate", i belgi e i caledoniani, coi loro stati fantoccio). 
Detto questo per dovere di correttezza, non do un voto alto per una questione di gusti personali. Il gioco ha un impianto di regole troppo corposo: ho due slot liberi per questo tipo di giochi, e sono già occupati da altri titoli!

I bought this at college or more probably university, anyway I have racked up over a hundred games, with Red winning 26%, Blue 25%, Green 25% and Purple 24%. It is a simple push and shove game with players earning VPs for holding areas at certain times and sometimes for killing enemy leaders and units. A very good game for working out national strategies and tricks, with a certain amount of deal making and attacking-the-leader.

An asymmetric wargame with not too complex rules and has an enjoyable historic theme.

I enjoyed my one play - it has an epic scope and a lot of opportunities for various strategies to play out.

Great theme and interesting mechanics.  Sort of long and drawn out.  Some get board of it easily.

One of my favourite board/wargames.  Although it's stated that the game is for 3-5 players don't be misled; it works for four players perfectly and anything else is a bit of a bodge.

RATING: 8
In my opinion, a minor classic and a neat snapshot of a formative slice of British history. The gameplay was totally unique when we first played it in the early 1990s. The later editions tweaked one or two rules but the game remains the same, has stood the test of time and doesn't feel like an old game. 

The game depicts the invasions and struggles for power in Britain from the time of the Roman invasion to the eleventh century Norman invasion. The game can be played with two or three players, but everything is really set up for four. Each player is allocated a different 'basket' of peoples/tribes; each one is different and they all appear at the appropriate historical time. Points are scored at various times during the game for occupying certain areas of the map (each tribe has its own objectives) and for achieving other aims. The constantly intriguing aspect is that every player progresses at different speeds so it is often difficult to know who is leading: for instance, the player controlling the Romans will garner big points early in the game as their strong units obliterate the weaker inhabitants and take control of great swathes of England; his other nations under his control won't appear for some time. Meanwhile, other players become stronger as time progresses and the likes of the Scandinavian peoples start to invade. At the same time, tribes termed Welsh and Caledonian head for the hills and usually doggedly manage to survive (and steadily gain points throughout) because they are so difficult to root out of the rugged uplands. 

We only seem to play this once every few years but it's probably the best of our old games.

It is time to play this again. When I first played Britannia, back in the day when Mooses was one of the younger members of our gaming group, I thought it was too scripted. At that time we were playing some very heavy duty war games. (TSS, 3R, etc.) at that time, the more complex the game, the better the game. Times have changed; I have changed. It is time to play Britannia again.

A design that was ahead of its time. If provides a neat historical perspective. Many of the rules exceptions are there to force the parties into historical objectives and patterns. Players must pay careful attention to the victory point goals of each power they control. Balances civilization aspects to combat. The combat is very simple and luck can play a good part in thwarting your plans, but such is life. Somewhat similar to History of the World - but this is a better game.

The best historical simulation style game I've ever played. It has fairly light use of exceptions to the rules and yet still creates a game where you very much feel as though you are being taken through a tour of the history of England. The play pieces that come with the game are great to assist you along with what happens each turn. The mechanics leave a wide variance to how things can happen, but yet still gives you encouragement for working towards the actual events that happens. Highly enjoyable experience. This is of course for the FFG edition of the game.

Not to mention that the FFG version is a beauty to behold.

Although this multi-player war game is incredibly simple, it successfully evokes its theme very well.

What I liked mechanically about this game is that alliances are constantly shifting. It's always a one-against-three situation, and each player has a chance to be the "one" against all the other players.

However, the game is a bit too long for what it is. I'm assuming though is that after repeated plays, four players can play this under three hours (my first and only game took five).

One potential reason for the long game duration is the poor graphic design. I think I played the original Avalon Hill version. I don't mind the bland artwork at all. What I do mind is that the objectives for each player are printed on a number of cards in a small typeface. Considering that each player controls four or more factions, and most of the objectives involve controlling specific areas on the map, a lot of time is spent cross-referencing not just your objectives but all the other players' objectives.

This constant cross-referencing ceases to be an issue after repeated play since these objectives never change. However, that raises an issue of replayability. Since I do not foresee me playing this often, this to me isn't a problem. I think, though, that there is still a lot of replayability in this game despite the fixed objectives: the main conflict. I think, is whether to pursue your objectives and open yourself to attack, or focus on taking over a lot of territory so that you can generate more units faster.

Britannia isn't perfect, it might not even be very good, but I like it a lot anyway. It reproduces the various invasions of the British Isles from Romans all the way to the Normans, it's pretty good looking, and it's got very interesting gameplay. It just doesn't have a lot of replayability and takes a long time to finish.

It's way too rules heavy for the gameplay you get.
I found it too long and atleast two of our 4 players wanted to stop playing at round 10.
It's mostly a game about making deals with other players. If you get unlucky and all other players go against you for one or two rounds you game may be finished until your next race may step in. Which means 1 hour in which you just watch the others play.
Very unsatisfying 7 hour game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As a simulation of actual history of invasions of the British Isles, it may be great, but the features that make it great at that, definitely detract from it AS A GAME.  In order to score the most victory points, every player has to constantly worry about nit-picky details in order to take the actions that his side actually did, and he loses points if he does anything else.  Although that may be educational, it is NOT great fun.  I also think the combat system is far too random, and that often causes long strings of fruitless dice rolling on a single turn (Mare Nostrum has a much better system).  And I was frustrated and annoyed by NUMEROUS rules put in (for 'historical accuracy' perhaps?) that were illogical and counter-intuitive (e.g. "no, they HAVE to go back to sea; they can stay on land after the NEXT turn") or nit-picky (e.g. "that hero can only show up if you own that territory on that turn") and simply detracted from the fun of playing the game.  Ok, criticism aside, there was some fun and there was some skill involved, and there was some stuff here to learn, so it wasn't ALL bad, and I'm not sorry I played it once; I might even play it again sometime.

Just like England's win in the ashes: it took about twenty years too long. Sort of like an uninteresting History of the World. Idea is decent, combat is fine, but it is a little scripted and has a very annoying victory point system where every region's value changes for different nationalities each turn. This really annoyed me. I'd play the FFG version for the fun of it, but my attention seriously wanders when playing this type of civilization game.

One play.  The short three-player variant is broken.  Really needs to be played with four players, all of whom know what is coming in future rounds.  In this sense, it's probably one of the most perfectly balanced games ever, but it makes it hard to get it to the table.

I see no point in wasting hours playing a game pre-modeled by scripted, inevitable changes in power as each turn follows the next. I want strategy, not an exercise in applying spur-of-the-moment survival tactics for my forces overwhelmed by a round-by-round, who-plays-what lottery.

However, if British military history is your cup of tea, you might be attracted to this game, as it explains such historic events better that a textbook. Provided you can read rules like these.

Good fun, relatively clean playing.  The ground-breaking stuff is the sequenced nation entry which has the benefit of obscuring the leader until the end of the game.

I really like this game which guides you through 1100 years of British history. Mostly played this with 3 players, which is not as balanced as it should be (but still OK if the players switch sides for every new session). Would be even better with 4 players.
Does not have the nice bits (you play just with coloured chits) but remember that this is an oldie and the absence of miniatures is amply made up for by the solid gameplay.

Great game. 

The FFG edition has a garish yellow for board and no names on counters makes it difficult to identify tribes/ peoples. Especially as the counter graphics suffer from the 'Braveheart' syndrome - all the Celtic types are shown wild half naked whilst the Germanic tribes are in sedentary poses. With no text on the counters it is hard to tell one bunch from another. Miss purple counters. Just wish the Avalon Hill  counters had been at least on par with the Gibsons ones instead of being faded or better still matched the colourful ones in the Maharaja  game.

Amazing epic game! I would rate it a 10 if it didn't take so long, but I think game time will speed up once we are more familiar with the setup each round.  I love how it is a goal-oriented war-game, with each peoples having specific objectives to get maximum points, and the narrative arc of how different races rise and fall is great.  Looking forward to a lot of solo and multiplayer play of this one.

Update: It's a 10. My wife and I are playing a ton of it now 2 player, with each of us controlling 2 colors, but playing each colors independently (e.g. not purposely avoiding attacking one of your colors with the other color).  Game time is not an issue now, as we just leave it set up and come back to it when we have time.

FFG version - I've not played this anywhere as much as the Gibsons / AH versions, but my impressions are of too much added complexity that detracts from the clean, smooth playing of the earlier editions.

A rather good light multiplayer war / civ game. There's a lot of history here in a very small ruleset. I'm surprised at some of the comments here about the game being too long; at 4-5 hours it feels about right to me. Four player is the main mode, but the three player game is very good too.

I'm also surprised that this isn't a popular top 50 game, as there's something here for most people: an FFG logo for the Ameritrashers, history for the wargamers, balance for the Eurogamers, etc.

Risk with history. Sure there's a lot of dice rolling, but there's nothing wrong with that. What you're doing here is being led on a history tour of Britain as you try to squeeze every last bit of potential out of various groups of people. Sometimes that requires you to hold back and defend areas, while at other times you need to play aggressively and attack certain players, leaders or areas. There are various points on offer for the different groups to achieve certain conditions. Each player has to assess what's achievable and at what cost. Thankfully, even though the game is pushing and prodding you in certain directions, there's still a great deal of scope for playing in different ways.

In theory it's a great system. In reality you need to be able to tolerate lengthy periods in the game where you'll not have a great deal to do. Each player has lull periods where they'll just be looking to sit tight where they are and defend. For the inexperienced player I'd suggest this is a great opportunity to plan and look at other peoples' objectives. A lot can be learned and planned, for example, by seeing that The Danes and The Dubliners both need York on turn 13 for eight victory points. It's also a good time for a chat.

All in all it's a lot easier to play than a read through of the rules makes it out to seem - not that there's anything wrong with the rules - it's just that to add the historical flavour there are more than a few specific exceptions to how a group of people do something. That's a good thing though, because it takes an simple system and turns it into something more.

Experienced players should get through this in about four hours. History buffs should get a kick out of it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you think you'll only be playing once - there's too many objectives to take in and become familiar with to bother with it for just one play. I'd like to give it a whirl about once or twice a year, but there are better and shorter games out there if you're looking for a similar experience with more fun - Vinci springs to mind. This is just for the British history fun of it.

This is an excellent 4-player game that uses historical positions and goals to assign VP.  Due to the multiple races for each player, their time delayed entry, and the race specific VP goals, this game does not fall into the same "kill the leader" trap that many other multiplayer game fall into.  In fact, it can be rather difficult to know who is truly leading until the very end, which I find somewhat refreshing.  It has been recently re-released by Fantasy Flight and seems to have kept faithful to the original gameplay with a couple of new twists.

The fact that you are rewarded for taking your nations down the same path they actually took historically feels weird and contrived to me. I end up wishing the game was more like an open-ended sandbox.

The ebb and flow effect of the invasion schedules is actually pretty beautiful, like watching Conway's Game of Life or something. But it's not very fun to play out in practice because everything feels so predetermined. The perspective is so birds-eye, and you wear so many different hats over the course of the game, that I end up not really caring too much about what happens on the board.

Part of me feels I should give this game another chance - it's a wonderful concept and the FFG edition is beautiful, so I want to like it. But there's plenty of other fish in the sea, so why bother?

Great historical game. Starting with Roman invasion to Britannia eding with William the Conqueror conquest. Best played in four players - in fact I wouldnt play it in any different count.

RATING: 7
The concept of this game being a 4 hour game boggles my mind.  Great historical feel with rising and falling civilizations.  People complain that it is too scripted, but this is the kind of game that you play once every three years. If you don't overanalyze the game plan from the beginning, then the overscripting shouldn't be an issue.  In fact, while it may be scripted to a certain degree, you do get to change the course of history.  What other game gives the Picts a fighting chance?
  
Wonderful fun with good friends into history, but because of the random nature of the dice you have to rely on company to keep this engaging.  This would be horrible with strangers, or the scary pick-up wargamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Certainly not a wargame and also not much fun solitaire.  

It's more of a historical play where actors enter and leave on cue and then are graded on how well they delivered their lines.  The best acting troupe wins in the end but since the roles aren't equal it's hard to tell who's ahead at any particular part in the play...which is actually a small mark in its favor, I guess.

The rules are a simple structure loaded to the gills with exceptions in the hopes you won't discovered the game has all the decision making of Risk.

It took us a little bit to figure this one out, but once we did, it moved right along. Unfortunately, it starts with the toughest part of the game with rules that have lots of exceptions (e.g., for the Romans). And I'm not sure we ever got the raiding rules correct. But you want to play with exactly 4 players, no more, no less, whatever the rules say.

After playing it a second time, I have a little less interest in playing it again. Just not exceptionally exciting. But the history it introduces you to, especially for English speakers, is incredible!

Disclaimer - I have only played this twice, so mybe my first impression is simply wrong and my concerns about the game come only from not beeing familiar enough with it...

My main problem was that I fealt like the gameplay was a bit to much "on rails" and both games I played fealt really similar to each other. And there was also the issue of a player beeing hopelessly behind (at least it seemed so to us - again, maybe we missed clear opportunitties for him to catch up), but having to wait for a rather long game to finish.

Ancient era theme.  game fairly easy to learn and play. Very 'dicey' combat system that can be frustrating.  The player factions are somewhat balanced.  Game play is very fluid and encourages players to refrain from 'turtling'.  The components are very good - mounted board and thick cardboard pieces.  Artwork is fair.  Game length is very long, feels like a player should get more for the time invested.

One of my 10 favorite games of all time.  Only for four, quite long, and susceptible to lots of kibitzing and a bit of kingmaking (often literally) at the end.  But very fun.  It takes a long time to get familiar with the flow of the game and be able to see the longer-term strategies for each side, and how best to pursue or thwart them.

It's the game I wish Civilization had been.

Edit:  The new version (after one play) is probably an improvement, which is only to be expected after 20 years!  And kudos to FFG on the pretty new look and the decision NOT to use minis.

A long game to play - about 5 hours. With dice rolls for combat it can be decided on luck rather than skill, which for 5 hours is maybe not what you want from a game. Much like History of the World, it's a good game in it's day. The new Fantasy Flight version has superb production values.

FFG 2005 edition. One 4p game. Initial impressions are of a well-produced, richly thematic game. The ebb & flow of the various nations acts as an interesting constraint & defines scoring opportunities that vary between players and between turns. Length & downtime are the problem, of course. Life's too short.

A disapointing game experience. A lot of history and nice theming to be found in here, but if you look at the gameplay itself, I fail to see it as any more than an evolved version of Risk. (And I really don't like Risk.) My "major" civilization was also coming up at the end of the game, so prior to that, I had a couple of hours, where I could hardly do more than push a couple of bits around. I felt completely out of the game, and there was nothing I could do to prevent it, nor could I do anything to get out of my misery. (Except get up and leave the game) It might be an acceptable game, if it didn't take so frickin long. Instantly put on my for-trade list.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Ancient Battles - Historical Simulation - 3-5 Players - 4h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Well, that first game didn't really work out all that well. The game seemed dreadfully slow, I didn't get the feeling of having very many options available to me, and the combat resolution system was nastily reminiscent of Risk to me. After playing for 3 to 4 hours, we called it quits having completed about half of the game. Note that this included figuring out the rules from the rule book.

I suppose it needs more plays to be sure I don't like it, but I'm not sure I'm willing to commit the time.

This game probably does a resonably good job in following history - but for my group, the scenario of this game was limiting the players too much.

I really like the idea of the game, and I'd like to play it more. However, it has two important issues:

- Playing time. There's no way you can play it in less than 6 hours if you're not completely familiar with the game, the rules, etc. I have to say that it doesn't feel long or repetitive, and that even in other players' turn everybody is interested in the game. However, you must have all the day to play.

- Dependent on the other players. At least with non-experienced players (giving the playing time, good luck to find an expert!) your outcome is greatly influenced by the bad movements of everybody else. I mean, as Roman, if the green player doesn't surrender quickly, you (and he) are dead.

Strategically constricted. Dice based combat. Fiddly raider rules. There are some definite potential weaknesses to Britannia and I could understand why many would not regard this as a great game. I regard it as a bit of a guilty pleasure (at least liking it as much as I do) but here is why I think Britannia [i]is[/i] a great game.

This historical war game focuses on a rich, complex gameplay experience without trying to add multiple synergistic mechanics. Race cards don't have unique 'bonuses' but rather entirely different win conditions, army sizes and even points at which they enter the game. I adore the way this game functions, where not every nation is made equal. The Romans will smash you, but you can fight back for small, key tactical victories. You have to fight this player and achieve such and such objective, but at the same time invaders are invading almost every turn, various nations are fighting and clawing to get their objectives and the game state is always changing. However, it follows a somewhat predictable pattern that you can pre empt before events happen. 

Britannia also has a very clever and unique way of balancing players throughout the game; it doesn't give handicaps to the loser, but as new races are always entering the board all players will have a chance to dominate and earn more points in the future, no matter how badly they have played thus far. 

Britannia ticks all the boxes for me for an engaging war game. Historical, thematic, objective driven, balanced via points/objectives and phasing races, streamlined combat and a multitude of factions with vying interests.

For lack of better description I'll call Britannia "Advanced historical Diplomacy in Britain".

Yet to play with my new FF version but it's at least a 9 as it's so similar - and I like that there are more leaders - and more Danish leaders. The Danes never did quite enough for me.
Edit: Played v.FF now and although the game went on for far longer than previous version ever did (6 hours?!) it is definitelya better version - more leaders, and better for the ahistorical last Danish surge. Upgraded to 9.5. It's just so beautifully worked. 3 cheers Lew!

I love this game. I really do, but I want to love it more. Has game balance problems in 3 and 4 player variants, and have tried to re-balance forces, but never quite managed it. If every player was equal, it would definitely get a 9, cos it really is a whole load of fun.
Edit: Used to play mainly with 3 of us. But just had a 4p and and like this it definitely works. It is just so cleverly balanced.Updated to a 9

A solid and fun, if somewhat simple, game. The replayability is a strong point, even if most games tend to follow the same motions, since the objectives of the various factions do not vary from game to game.

You need to invest several sessions in this game to learn the basics, preferrably four, one with each colour. But if you have the patience to learn it, the payback is enormous. I've probably played like 50 sessions of 4 hours each, and it is still my favourite. The history lesson is awesome.

A game that's ridiculously long and definitely not for everyone, and yet I love it anyway.  There's something about the dynamics of this game that just 'make' it for me.  I'd probably rate it a 10 in how often I'd be willing to play it, but practicalities of time and the learning curve of the game make it impossible to play as much as I'd like, which therefore frustrates me and therefore lowers my rating.

Great game. A true historical epic. I have heard great things about the game proper (ie the 4 player version). However, as yet I've only played the three player, shorter version, and I must say that it is truly broken. 2 players got great races and the other got crappy ones. The third player didn't have a chance from the start. I am very keen to play this game as the true 4 player variant.

one of my favorite games, because I love "sweep of history" games and it's the best of the bunch.

And I have fond memories of it.

Could be considered as the first wargame I completed when I played for the most part "eurogames".

After the hiatus of 15+ years, I've played the FFG version which is every bit as fun as the Avalon Hill version I had memories of. The game is really well balanced as all the scores, from the 1st to the last, were within a 20 points range (3 points between the winner and the second one).

A good game that could be so much better if the designers had spent more time alloting the factions in a reasonable way for the three player game.  Faction A should not get the Romans, then the Romano-Britons and Saxons simultaneously, as that gives Player A a tremendous advantage in racking up victory points while leaving him with nothing to do in the final 2-3 turns of the game.  (Historically, the Romano-Britons were not exactly on good terms with any of the barbarian invaders, so it is difficult to figure out who to pair the Romano-British with).  It would make much better sense to give him the Jutes and let one of the other players have the Saxons.  Later on, Player A should get either the Norwegians or Normans to have a chance to put a king on the throne.  Whatever changes could be made, it is imperative that the Saxons and Danes be controlled by different factions.

Britannia is a historical board game that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066. Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain’s history in important ways, creating countless interesting “what if?” scenarios. What if Boudicca’s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066? In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.

A good, if somewhat long, game.  Played with brisk players, it's quite fun.  Played with slow players, it's hellish.

This game avoids a lot of bash-the-leader problems by cleverly structuring who's where when and by restricting mobility and growth just enough so you can't just rush around the board, but not so much as to not leave players a decent set of options.

Its storyline is excellent, with a strong opening (the Romans) and a good climax (as the Saxons take on both the descendants of the Vikings and the Normans).

My favorite 4-player "light" wargame.  Far, far better than most Ameritrash offerings, such as Samurai Swords.

I have not played the new edition.

Absolutely excellent and unique game: a mixture between an empire-building game with simplified battles, and a history game.  It's a wonderful visual history lesson, showing how many different peoples - and languages - invaded Britain from the Romans to the Normans, which explains the many different ways of expressing oneself in English as well as inconsistent English word pronunciations.  But more than that, it's a really great strategic 4 player game.  Always enjoyable to play.  You need to allow quite few hours to finish the entire campaign game from the Romans through to the Normans; there are also some shorter scenarios.  Shame that Britannia is out of print.  I do hope that Lee Pulsipher, the designer, succeeds in getting a publisher to publish a third edition - he has some ideas for different versions of a 3rd edition.

It's difficult to evaluate britannia. Every game is great however is difficult to play it. Two players scenarios are nice but the game is meant to be played exactly in four player, I don't like the three players mode, better five if not four.
The gamelenght is not 180 minutes as the box shows, but between 4 and 5 hours.

The rules are simple, really, but you need to known all the factions (and there are so much factions...) in order to organize your strategies: forces,objectives,abilities,timing and so on...

Every game is so different from the others and you can hardly tell who is going to win until the very end when you sum all the points.

Finally I understand every comment on this game (except for the 1s), It's Britannia, love it or hate it.

There's something about this game that hits me just right.  I love the unequal but balanced factions, and the nation-specific goals.  It takes all the good parts from [gameid=224] and eliminates the silly empire drawing system.  This might be the best-looking game in my collection ([url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/publisher/17]Fantasy Flight[/url] reprint).  The colors are bright but not obnoxious, the art is lavish, the board is beautiful, and the pieces, though cardboard, give the game a pleasant tactile experience.  You really do feel like you're witnessing history as you're playing this.  The one drawback that I find is that the game suffers from needing experienced players for the factions to be balanced.  Newbies don't understand the flow of the game enough to realize that the current score doesn't necessarily translate into who is winning.  Using [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/20025/b2points-pdf]the score summary from the files section[/url] makes a huge difference and allows the game to turn out much closer.  Make sure that you play Jutes after Saxons, as stated in the FAQ, as it will make a much more balanced game.

Neat game hafway between a heavy wargame and a euro.  Players each control a sequence of tribes with specific objectives and try to coordinate a strategy across 1000 years of history.  Plays very long, with deep options.

Not much war game playing in my profile, BUT I do enjoy these games (althought they tend to play longer than expected).  I found it very interesting how 17 nations play 16 rounds of battle with a constant influx of reinforcements.  Took me about 6 rounds to get the "flow" (population, movement, battle, etc).  Enjoyed my time as the green player and look forward to my next play.

Britannia has this strange appeal. Despite similar gameplay each time, players still argue, debate and retry things over and over. An absolute classic in our gaming group.

Update: Has been pretty much eclipsed by newer designs in our group.

This is for the fantastic looking FF version. Upped the rating after realize I always want to play this game. Scripted, but you still have to make hard choices and the game turns out completely different everytime. Repeated plays will definatly improve your score - experience matters. The game isn't perfect - but I'm giving it a rare 10 because rarely has a game captured my interest for such long periods of time. Congrats to Lew.

Best intro-wargame I know so far. Dice fest may be too overwhelming for euro-players, but as for wargamers, it's bearable. Main flaw - it's too long. 6h with not experienced players it's a disaster. Project's becoming dated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent game - but only suitable for 4 players. The balance does not seem to work very well with 3 or 5. The reason it only gets a 7 is the length of time to play a game through and it is still my opinion that the game is balanced in favour of the red and purple factions compared to the other 2.

RATING: 7.25
An interesting game. A little too much die rolling for my liking.  I would play again but not a game I would own.

ADDED: So much for this original coomment as I just acquired this one. :) Of course I got it for $20 so how could I say no.

Watching/recreating the waves of invaders that shaped Great Britain into the dark-ages is worth the 3-4 hour playing time, occasionally. 

Haven't played the Hasbro/AH re-release.

RATING: 9
If a mark of a good game is its ability to generate a narrative, then this is a great game.  The time the Romans were defeated by a lone Brigante warband; the wars between the Picts and Caledonians lasting five hundred years; the lone Belgae colony in Lincolnshire which lasted till the Norman invasion... fantastic fun and asymmetric in all the right places.

RATING: 8
Excellent old style strategy game with a historical theme. This little beauty is a remake of the classic Avalon Hill tittle. Whilst the core set of rules is easy to grasp, there are tons of exceptions in the rules which make this more difficult to tackle. Also the game length is considerable, running well over the 4 hour mark. Game satisfaction derived makes this well worth it.

RATING: 8
Excellent long complex game that covers the history of Britain's invasions from the Romans to the Normans. Each of the players get to control several nations that arrive at different time periods and have specific scoring conditions. The battles get resolved with dice. So, although there is a luck element, it is tolerable if you know the odds and understand the flow of the game.

RATING: 6
FFG Brit (Brit2, for the cognoscenti). Definitely feel the comments about a strategic straightjacket are wrong. The downstream effects of future civs in your color, the turn order, the conflicting/complementary VP allocations are all good. 

Less good is the pacing and the granularity. Some of the detail (esp. raiders, given the granularity: is that one unit at sea really changing much?) fails to add anything but flavor. The combat resolution is way too old-school and variable. And yet...I like the game, overall. The biggest flaw is the strict 4-player requirement, but I knew that going in. Second flaw is the length; it's just too hard to justify. One of the very few games I've bought and re-bought, but I'm done with it. Just can't justify the opportunity cost.

I have both the old edition and finally got a copy of the new FFG version now that the 2nd edition has been printed.  The new version makes a few minor rules edit corrections over 1st edition and adds a few changes in arrivals and Roman issues.  Overall, a nice improvement on the original AH version.

RATING: 7.8
Had this version in shrink for years and didn't get interested in it until FFG decided to re-release it.  A solid area control game tracing the historical conquest of the isles and keeping the arrival of conquering races in historical perspective.  I've found lots of websites and ariticle dedicated to strategies for this game.  It's the one that started all the other similar games for other countries (like Italia).  Worth getting the FFG copy if you don't have this one yet.

Pros
The idea of the several tribes who come and sometimes go.
Nice components.
If you score bad on one tribe you got a "second" chance on another tribe.

Cons
The dice!
The complicates system of scoring points. Although a friend of mine made a very good sheet (brit_tribalscore_sheet.pdf) for consulting these points.
It is very hard to determine if you are scoring well.

RATING: 6
I'm glad I played this, but I doubt I'll play it again.  It is too long, and I think the game plays itself to some extent depending on what happens to the Romans in the first few turns.  Also, several of the players have really long downtimes where nothing they do is meaningful.  Let's be honest, the Green player might as well mail the game in until the Danes show up, with a couple of surprise attacks here and there.  In contrast, after the Romans are gone, yellow can go out for a beer.  There are other games in a similar vein that I'd rather play, most notably Twilight Imperium and Game of Thrones.

The system is simply outstanding.  The game rules are relatively simple and plays smooth.  The map, counters, and charts are well laid out and quite attractive.  The game provides tense situations and a whole lot of fun.

This game has interesting elements and a good historical feel, but I can never tell who's winning until the end. Kinda puts a shroud of mystery over the game and then all of a sudden the game's over and someone won. Never who I think it is. I probably havent wrapped my brain around this one yet...

Eén van de langste spellen die ik gespeeld heb, maar toch boeit het de hele tijd.

Epic risk. Je speel de geschiedenis van het britse eiland van de bezetting door de romeinen tot na de middeleeuwen. Iedere speler neemt een aantal volken op zich die gaandeweg het spel komen en verdwijnen. Gevechten vinden plaats met dobbelstenen a la risk. Door de dynamiek van de continue verschijnende en verdwijnende volken blijft het toch boeien tot het eind. Het ene moment ben je bijna uitgeschakeld, maar in de volgende ronde kun je zo maar weer een stuk hebben ingenomen.

Nadeel is wel dat de verschillende volkensets niet erg lekker gebalanceerd zijn. Afzonderlijke puntenverschillen van meer dan 100 punten zijn niet opmerkelijk.

Played lots of times (100+). I was once part of a very active group of Britannia players and played that game very often (always with 4 players). Although it seems to be very script-driven, most games differ enough from each other to remain interesting (if only by the results of the dice). I have not played it in the last few years, but would try the new version if I got a chance.

RATING: 10
Superb game, not a single game is the same even hough it "should" be. 

The only drawbacks:
Knowing/memorizing the province names. 
The memorizing/knowing of who/what comes next turn what provinces do they want.
Takes a lot of extra time unless you have at least 2 people counting scores and that you have german efficient dicerolling procedures ie attacker rolls defence and offencedices. With 200+ dicerolls its a pain to watch people waiting for the attackers dices to fall before rolling their own thus wasting 3-4 s for every roll that adds up to like 30 min of wasted time.

Don't play the historical strategy which gives you short term victory point. Remember that historically everyone who invaded England got beaten up by the next invader. The game gives short term VP rewards for the historical strategy but then you get beaten up by the next invader.

So play a different startegy, almost anything will do. The objective is to collect victory points over the long term. Not to die to a historical schedule.

Fun, and unlike a lot of superficially similar games (Vinci, History of the World), actually works, thanks to victory points mechanism. I'd question its having a great deal of replayability thanks to the fixed setup and (again in consequence of the victory points) broadly fixed gameplay, but it's certainly great fun for a few plays. And I could be wrong- this is only based on two plays.

Britannia is a fun, but occasionally frustrating game. It needs four players and is quite lengthy. I love the historiographical feel, but the strategies involved aren't immediately obvious and take several plays to figure out. Combined with the long play time, this isn't very casual friendly.

After subsequent plays, the long playing time is really starting to kill this one. For the time investment, I'd rather play TI3. On to the trade pile it goes.

The 5-player variant also felt somewhat unbalanced.

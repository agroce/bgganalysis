RATING: N/A
Used to be a favorite of mine, and it was my introduction into the world of cooperative games, and I've started getting it back out a little more lately.  My favorite category was "Bigger than, less than," since it was the loosest, and allowed for the most creativity.

RATING: 8.5
This is a really good game.  First of all, for a Party Game, this is a rare beast - it's hard - sometimes VERY hard.  Mind you, this is partly because I am English and have played it with an American set of cards (no one had a clue what a Pottery Barn was).  Having said that, 90% of the cards are fine for English minds.  It's only vaguely similar to Cranium - there are variable categories of things to do throughout the game and which one you do is mostly down to luck.  Regarding the original Cranium - even if you mix the two sets of cards in, it's not as hard as Hoopla.  

Here, the Tweener and Tongue-Tied sections are great ideas and really get people's brains working.  We have had great fun with those. I also love the way you can change the amount of cards in play at the start according to how you feel the group will manage. 

Basically, if you want a Party Game that is intellectually Challenging but doesn't deal with something that's a little obscure (such as proverbs - and there's a few games that do that sort of thing), then you may have found it here.  This is testing, but great fun.  Recommended.

Silly party game with no competitive elements.  Everybody playing is trying to beat the clock as a single group.  More about knowing your friends than knowing the game.

Pros
- Co-op party games are hard to find
- No stress of competing against anyone besides the clock
- Fun drawings and clues to give
- Funny to see people forced to do a category they can't do
- Creates laughter and a fun environment

Cons
- If you play a lot in a row or after awhile, you'll remember the cards

Excellent party game.  We had a lot of fun playing.  There were five of us - in the first game, we beat the timer just under the wire, but in the second game, we still had about six minutes to go.  I'll be interested to play with more to see how we go.  I wouldn't recommend it for less.

Essentially a 2 player version of Cranium, and it's a good substitute when you can't get the 4 people needed for the big game.  It's fun, although we find it pretty difficult.  There also aren't enough cards, so we ran out quickly.

One of the better party games, it only suffers when played frequently because there are a small amount of cards. Unlike most party games, I'd definitely buy an expansion.

RATING: 6.5
One of only a few cooperative party games I've played.  It's great fun and a bit challenging your first couple of times through.  The game requires some knowledge of specific people of places but nothing too obscure.  After several plays you will find yourself wanting to repeat certain clues when the "your choice" option comes up, which is the main reason we don't play it as much anymore.

RATING: 6
A fairly good cooperative party game.  The only drawback is that some of the cards feature people/places that out-of-touch people might not know.  Also the bigger-than smaller-than clues prove difficult for some players.  However with the right crowd this still gives you the fun of a party game and eliminates the difficulties of creating evenly matched teams.  The game can be a little too easy with 4 or less people, though (I would suggest shortening the time limit in that instance.)

This is actually a decent version of Cranium. It's a cooperative version and includes many of the same "fun" aspects of the game. We've pulled this out and played as a family quite often (Mom, Dad and three boys). Many of the cards were too old for my 10 yr. old (didn't know famous people for instance) but permitting him to change cards when this happened works just fine.

The concept of a cooperative party game is a nice idea. I'm not such a great fan of A) party games, B) the Cranium family. In my one playing of Hoopla, with 7 or 8 players...it was WAY too easy for us to get the win. 

I like the clock which limits total game time and keeps things moving. I'd be willing to play this one again, but I won't get a copy or ever be the one requesting it.

RATING: 8
Components: The full-color photographs on the cards are garish but fun. The timer works well, with its large button for slapping. Blue and purple are a bit samey on the die.

Experience: Lots of fun. Playing all as one team is tense and allows all players to be active each turn. Restricting me to one type of clue-giving, yet allowing me to select from a card from my hand creates an interesting challenge.

Cloodle, Soundstage, and Tongue-tied all work well. Tweener is a bit nebulous, as we can easily begin to say whatever we want, since many cards don't naturally fit into a size comparison.

Knowing when to use the wild tokens can be crucial.

Players can change the amount of time available to adjust the level of challenge. Also, we leave the timer running during the entire game, rather than pausing it between turns, to increase the tension.

RATING: 6
Pretty good party game, and I say this as a guy who is as a general rule not too enthusiastic about the party game genre. Everyone cooperates to race against the clock with the shared goal of discarding every card before time expires. Cards contain well-known people, places and things, and it is up to the players to provide clues as to what they are to the group based on the roll of a die. It's actually quite satisfying to conquer the game as a team, and watching people attempt to draw and act out the contents of their cards ranges from amusing to hilarious. Everyone participates and no one is left out or marginalized. 

Sometimes you will encounter a situation where a clue cannot possibly be given in the manner in which you are instructed to do so by the die roll (this happens most often when asked to act out the object on your card). Aside from this minor complaint, this game is a quite fun if I'm in the right mood.

Good party game and more flexible than Cranium "Classic". This one's better for less competitive gamers, since it's cooperative, and it's a lot less intimidating if you've got a mixed group (young/old, experience/inexperienced, etc.). I also like the categories a little better than Classic, since the Humdingers I so hate are missing. For me, though, competing "against the timer" makes it a lot less exciting.

You have 15 minutes to guess all the cards. With 5 players that equals about 30 seconds per card. I knew we were in trouble when on my girlfriend's dad's turn he hit the timer then stared at his hand for 3 minutes without making a move. Then he stopped the timer and said, "Pass." Do you realize that means we get an extra card penalty AND we burned 3 minutes. That was the end of that game, even though there was still a good 10 minutes to go.

[Party Game] [9P:?] Hoopla needs some parameters for player-to-card ratio governing difficulty. With 9 players it was impossible to complete the game with each player having 4 cards plus the 8 in the draw deck (20 seconds per card - just no damned way). We ahd fun attempting it though. Keep the ratio at around 40 to 45 seconds per card and the game should be challenging. (In our 9-player case, that's about 2 cards per player, plus the 8-card draw deck. For 4P the 4 cards recommended for the base game should work nicely. There's also nothing stopping you from dealing out asymmetrical hands to the players, or playing with less than 8 cards in the draw deck.) In any case, a worthy party game to have around. *** UPDATE: Outstanding cooperative party game. The cards aren't even a huge issue since there are enough for at least six games or so and you don't play with the exact same group all the time anyway so mixing the cards up combined with the different communication modes produces sufficient diversity. Still would not mind an expansion pack, especially a non-US-centered one (Jiffy Pop?).

This is a nice game for non-competitive types... you are all working together against the clock.  That makes it a great party game -- EVERYONE is either guessing or performing each turn.  Very fun.

This is an actual working cooperative Guesstures/Taboo game, complete with interesting cards, challenging time requirements, and a whole lot of fun packed into the box. It works like a charm with 2-3 players, which is a pretty unusual niche for this style of game.

The ONLY problem is the limited number of cards that come with the game. We ran out of new cards 7 games in... it'd be nice (hint, hint, Cranium people!) if you guys printed an expansion deck!

RATING: 6
A fun "party" game when you have a bunch of people, it's late at night, some have had a beer or two, and you're all a little loopy. Need silly friends to enjoy this. Serious hard core strategy type gamers will be bored, and not wish to participate with some parts of the game like "soundstage".

The problem with this (and any game with "cards") is that once you play the game several times, everyone starts to know the cards and know what to say or do for the team to guess them. So in the end this has to be shelved for a long period and then played again.

Blegh. Even for a Cranium game, this lacks any semblance of a sensible scoring mechanism. The rules give no provision for scaling with the number of players and it is a timed cooperative game. You could probably play it a bunch of times and figure out your own way that made sense, but by then you would have all of the (very few) cards memorized. No real reason to play this one again unless someone else wanted to.

This is [i]San Juan[/i] to [i]Cranium[/i]'s [i]Puerto Rico[/i]—it takes the best things from the base game and distills them down into a streamlined format and makes it co-op to boot.  The addition of time pressure increases the tension (in a fun way) while ensuring the game doesn't overstay its welcome.  All in all, better than the source material.

Hoopla is probably the only good Cranium game out there and my is it a good one at that.  I'm pretty partial to party games, so my love may not translate.  Still, I find the gameplay pretty crisp, challenging, and rewarding.  The best part in my book is that it is totally cooperative (no more crappy party game scoring problems, yay!).

Maybe I voted a bit too high - but I have to say that the three times I've played this - we all had a super fun time.  Lots of laughs and good times.  What else do you need in a party game?  Could have got a higher mark if there were more cards - or an expansion came out.  As it is I can never play this again as I know what all the cards are now! :-(

This cooperative game is a lot of fun.  A group tries to guess what is on the card using a variety of methods.  However, to make it challenging, the game must be heavily handicapped.  I recommend closer to 20 cards rather than the recommended 8 in the draw pile.

A party game you can play with 2?  Yes, and it's TONS of fun.  One of Cranium's best.  Great cards, great guessing methods.  It's so much fun and such a different experience playing co-operatively as one team.  I'd give it a 9, but it starts to be not as much fun when you start cycling through the cards.

RATING: 6.5
I would give this a slightly higher rating if not for two things. One, the cards run out fast. The game was much easier to win, once I had played it about 5 times (wink, wink). Two, the rules are slightly unclear about what is allowed or not allowed in each category. Other then that, I got a lot of bang for the buck with this game.

Not as fun as I had hoped.  I usually am not interested in the Cranium line, but high praises from several notable BGG users made this seem more attractive.  Still a fairly standard party type game with nothing really notable to set it apart from its competitors.  I don't see the point of the timer if you always set it to 15 minutes, regardless of the number of players.  15 minutes seemed too long for a 6-player game, a 2-player would definitely be over much more quickly.

A timed version of Cranium, designed for two or more players to play cooperatively.Each player is dealt 4 cards depicting commonly known people, places, or objects. Another 8 cards are added to a common Play Pile. Players then take turns rolling a die to determine what type of clues can be given, starting the timer, selecting a card from their hand, and trying to get the other players to guess what is on that card as quickly as possible.The four types of clues that can be given to describe your cards are:Cloodle - provide clues by drawing and doodlingTongue-Tied - use alliteration to give as many clues as possible that start with a single letterSoundstage - act out or provide sound effects for clues (but you can't use words!)Tweener - give hints in the form "It's bigger than blank but smaller than blank", using two objects that imply the answerAfter someone guesses the card in play, stop the timer and draw a new card from the Play Pile.

It's a Cranium game you should try. It's impressive that a party game can work for two players.

I love this party game. I wish they kept making expansions, though, because if you play it a lot, you start to memorize some of the cards. It's nice that it is collaborative and very flexible with what you can do. (For example, you can pick and choose which card you want to play based on what the dice shows.) Hoopla is fun and easy to teach, and  makes for a great start to game night- especially if you have 5-8 players, which can be a hard number to find games for.

Everyone is on the same team, against the clock.  And it actually works.  Questions are adequately difficult.  Playable by all.  Some rules are unclear and play balance is questionable as players are added, but no big deal.  Run out of cards after about 6 games.  A good recovery from the original Cranium, which was an unqualified debacle.

Excellent for gamers and non-gamers alike. Scalable difficulty and medium replayablility. Biggest problem is that there aren't expansion cards so once you've been through the deck a couple of times, you know the cards pretty well.

Your enjoyment may depend on how many are playing. With 4 players, it was about a 6, although maybe it was a general lack of enthusiasm.  With 8 players, however, we had a blast. For that session, I'd rank it a 9. The 7.5 splits the two.

Reduced rating - didn't seem as fun when we played it New Year's as other games.  Maybe I am just getting spoiled or have more of a preference for more thinking games.  It still a goo game to play - some of the cards you get can be VERY difficult, while others are rather simple - excellent balance.  Only drawback I can see after playing it after 4-5 times is that a booster box of new cards will be needed soon.  Much more so than with Cranium itself.  Great travel game!

As a cooperative party game, it is definitely unique.  The smaller the number of players you have, the easier it is going to beat the game.  When we played with four it was really easy, then with six it was a closer affair.  If you are playing with four players or less, you might want to consider starting the clock a little lower.

Favorite cooperative party game.  Perhaps my favorite cooperative game.  Yes, you will have to act silly, draw as best you can, and play word games, all in the same game.

Easily the best of the [b]Cranium[/b] line of games.

It's co-operative nature makes it unique amongst all other party games, thereby making it an essential purchase to those who like varied body of party games in their collection.

Only complaint - and it's a pretty big one - is that there are not enough cards to make it past a handful of plays.

The fix? Grab any word-generating party game (Thingamajig, Catchphrase, Taboo, Guesstures, etc.) and use those words to extend play. It's just annoying you have to do that.

It's like team-Cranium, where everyone is playing against the timer. Either you all win, or you all lose, and it's tough to beat the timer if you play by the rules as written! I generally prefer a game where someone wins and someone loses, but this would be a fun closer. It does, however, need an expansion - you can get a lot of play from the included card set, but it's a good enough game that it should get more cards!

Excellent party game, far superior to regular Cranium. The orignal rules we though were a little lame so we changed them slightly. When someone guessed correctly, they were rewarded with the card they correctly guessed and they then proudly displayed it in front of them. They are also rewarded one point, but so is the clue giver. The cluegiver refills his hand back to 4 cards and you play until somebody correctly guesses an agreed upon amount of cards.

Play this game and use my house rule. NEVER STOP THE TIMER and once you complete this game with a set number of cards add more. We have almost complete 40 at one point. Hoopla will put cranium to shame. I do wish that there were more action choices to further customize the game. But the reality of this game is you can choose whatever versions you wish of the Cranium color actions and play your own custom game. Crazy fun in 15 minutes. The Ultimate filler.

After playing a few times, the group knows the cards so well that a lot of the challenge is gone. We ended up finishing every game way too early unless we added a whole lot of extra cards into the mix, or we had a good number of unexperienced players (and even so, the guessers could usually figure it out). That said, it's a top-notch party game; I just don't want to play it as much anymore thanks to knowing the cards.

Terrific family game, appropriate for almost any group.  Later printings introduced a poker-chip-mulligan allowing you to opt out of a particularly problematic dice roll, which was a nice adjustment.

I've never found a totally suitable set of replacement cards, however, and as the included decks become stale the fun of the game takes a bit of a nosedive.  There's only so many times you can find new ways to do "The Grateful Dead" or "Nadia Comăneci" - both of which are also good examples of problematic cards for younger players even when the game had just been released.

Once an easy 9 - purchased extra copies to have on hand at both sets of parents/inlaws' houses - that has fallen in rating as it aged.

Fun game for a group that isn't (or doesn't feel like) being competitive... as everyone is on the same team so we all win or lose together :)

I think I like the other Cranium games a little better.  I don't think I like the timer.

A good family/party game in the spirit of Pictionary, Personal Preference, etc.  I like this slightly better than the original Cranium.  Needs way more cards to keep it fresh.

Co-operative trivia / activity / party game from the cranium family of games.  Pretty fun & quick to play (~20 minutes).  Some clues are American-slanted, but it can be very fun.

The best part is that it is timed and a group game.

1 Play with 4. I had a great time and want to try again. We were all dead tired, so I hope this isn't one of those games I prefer to be tipsy to play.

A fun party-type and cooperative game. Takes elements of cranium, but is more fun as it does not drag on. There is more pressure when there is just 2 playing, can be hard to get the other person to guess your word. The activities are an interesting variety.

Some of the cards are hard to do, but this is similar to Celebrities.  It's fun!

What a great party game. Team vs. time instead of against each other. Working together against the clock works much better than I thought it would. Good mix of activities and cards (with nice photographs to provide visual cues and context) provide lots of variety to the game. An excellent game. 

The game's only failing is the lack of more cards or an expansion... It is far too easy to run through all the cards! Thankfully you can make your own with some pre-perforated business card stock, clip art and some card sleeves.

Doesn't come with enough cards and some of them are real stumpers, but it's a fun diversion when you want a quick burst of fun.This is basically a timed Cranium.

Hoopla is a great party game.  Its cooperative play is nice for when you aren't feeling very competitve and the inventive gameplay can lead to some great laughs.  The adjustable timer lets you customize your game diffuculty and the game is always a challenge to win.  My only real complaints is that some of the borrowed activities from Cranium feel a little tired and also the game doesn't come with as many cards as I would like.

Tienes cartas con dibujos. Haz que los otros las adivinen dibujando, dando pistas con la misma letra, actuando, dando pistas como es más grande que "x" pero más pequeño que "y".

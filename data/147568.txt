GAME: Risk: The Walking Dead – Survival Edition
RANK: 3945
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play with 2 players.
We were quickly educated on the dangers of the Zombies.
With two players though it didn't seem too great a strategy to win, with fate and chance determining weakness and leaving us to take advantage. Fun, but I'm sure better with more.
Finally, played with 3. More fun, but it seemed that the winner was mostly determined by chance. Which is probably an accurate simulation of a zombie apocalypse. So as long as you are fine with that, worth playing.
Me? I'm up for more.

Disclaimer - I am one of the few on here who love risk.  I LOVE THIS VERSION!  This is a really hard game, and it will beat you up, bad.  The zombies are unrelenting and really capture the idea of the walking dead..... how much can you cooperate to clear zombies while also competing with each other.  I do not understand the lower score on this game...... I know many do not love risk, but this is really an amazing game that functions in a very different and exciting way.

This is the best Risk I have played so far. It become a race of survival, because the walkers can and will take over the map in no time.  Our first game, we attacked between ourself like normal but in no time the walkers overrun change that. When the game ended there were about115 walkers, my wife had 24 survivals and I had only 8 troops left. events can be repetitive but they add a little more spice to the game. Overall a great game, I can't wait to have a 3-4 game soon.

I own 11 versions of Risk.  I like this one for the entertainment.  Risk strategy takes a back seat.  Walkers are a very real strategic threat.  We just finished our second game with 4 players.  Ending score 16, 11, 10, 8.

At one point the dead owned all but 10 of 32 territories.  The prison was totally surrounded and eventually overrun.  

A must play game for Walking dead fans either comic or show.

Enjoyable play but not as much fun as original RISK. Use a different strategy for this one - more cooperative. Everyone will get overrun by zombies. You just try to have more points than your opponents before the game ends.

A solid version of Risk, that does a great job with The Walking Dead theme.  See my full review here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1095437/review-of-risk-the-walking-dead-survival-edition

RATING: 8
Good fun, even 2 player. However, Overrun card mechanics need addressing as otherwise any players taking a turn after it is drawn get too much of an advantage over those who cannot have another turn. Enjoyable even given that :)

RATING: 8
The content is disappointing, no special platic figures inside, which you could expect if you have other Risk games like 2210ad, Stsrcraft, Halo Wars or Metal Gear Solid..., only the same simple truck and person figures for every player. Only color is different. 
Areas you know from the book, card pictures black and white scenes from the book too. 
The content and visual were a little disappointing!

Game play, let's see when this will hit te table... Think I have to convince a lot my gaming group, otherwise they woul not try. It's no eye-catcher, no "must-play" feeling if you look at the pure content.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good, but not great. Round 4 is where it starts to get interesting, as the Walkers start to stick around following Outbreaks. You'll probably get a kick out of it if you're a fan of zombies. Then again, if you're a zombie fan, you probably already own Last Night On Earth, Zombicide, Dead Of Winter, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Risk that knows when it should be over and with a surprisingly simple, yet effective feel of a world overrun by zombies. Good fun that doesn't overstay its welcome. The randomness of the die rolls, events, and infections are a little much, but if you go in with a sense of humor about it all, it ends up being a good time.

RATING: 7.5
When I first played this I thought "I don't really feel like playing RISK" after playing it the first time I was setting the board up again for another play. You will start the game fighting zombies as well as your other opponents but after a couple of outbreaks you will be trying to go around zombie controlled areas to get at other people. Love the feel of just trying to outlast everyone else. And of course you will have casualties that will turn and you will have to kill them as well. Great artwork so many Zombie games are bad but this one actually feels like you are just trying to live one more day.

Possibly the best 2 player risk ever designed. The first time a 'neutral' army has ever been truly dangerous (and fun) in any risk game. The special abilities are also nice and some of the random events are pretty cool, although the event deck could've been so much better than it is.

RATING: 6
Never having played Risk before owning this edition, I can't say how this one compares to the more traditional versions.  Gameplay is not overly long compared to what others have told me is standard for this genre, and having the Walkers as a third party opponent is really effective.  Components are ok, but the gameboard is pretty ugly.  While we enjoyed playing this when we pulled it out, it eventually stopped coming to the table.  Gave it to a friend.

I've played Zombie State, which I found entertaining enough, but a little too much about micro-management to feel quite as epic as it seemed it would. This seems like it might scratch a similar itch and maybe nail the theme a little more the way I'd like. Yeah, I know it's Risk, but the other Walking Dead games don't seem to have been very good, and this does have the original art, which is a bonus. Played now. Nothing like Zombie State, really. It's basically a randomised version of Risk, which is no harm for a quick fix. Zeds make fiendish plans irrelevant, because they spawn where they like and mess with your strategy. Good fun.

Adds more luck. A lot of time is spent resolving the zombie attacks which is more annoying than fun. Still took about 2.5 hours to play through with four people. I would rather play original Risk.

This game is solid. The difficulty level is a lot steeper than you think. The designers brilliantly infused the survival element of The Walking Dead into this version of Risk.

RATING: 7
I've mostly played 2 player games and the Zombie mechanic makes this much more enjoyable than vanilla Risk.  Now it's not just about attacking the other players, sometimes it's just trying to survive against the non player Zombie faction.  I've never really enjoyed the original Risk or dice rolling games in general, but this has an enjoyable twist that makes it worthwhile to play every now and then.

Risk was a game I grew up with and I like all the variations created over the years, the Walking Dead being no exception. You do feel overwhelmed by the walkers and have to cooperate with the other players to survive.

However, unless you love the theme there are better Risk games available.

I liked the different Risk experience _Chaos do Rule! ..there is Zombies after all.
Wished there had been more depth... 
As in incorporating more rules from Legacy, revised Risk or 2210 into this world.
More Event cards & more variety of Event cards would of  given more replay value and weight. 
But as is, a fun addition to the Risk collection.

Haven't played it in a while. The zombie attacks definitely make this more fun than vanilla RISK. It's less about controlling the board, and more about surviving the inevitable overrun. Semi-cooperative play may help your chances of survival, maybe. ;)

Well themed variant to Risk that actually works. A few small balancing issues with the Over Run card and also the Greene Family Group if used in a Conquest.

Typical Risk Game... except that you are attacked by random Zombies.  Spent most of the time fighting off Zombies instead of against opponents.  Your dead pieces have the chance to become Zombies creating chances to become overwhelmed.  Hope this is the closest I come to the Zombie Apocalypse.

You play this one a bit more defensively than other versions of risk. You can't just set up a strong perimeter and call it safe. Zombies will attack you from anywhere.

This game is simply a blast. Take Pandemic and add soul. This is pure entertainment, similar to the feel with King of Tokyo but with some real strategy. They did a tremendous job of incorporating the theme. It is a tough game to win. At times the game reminded me of the old Avalon Hill Wizards Quest but much more streamlined. Excellent beer and pretzels fun and a lot of laughs.

This game offers a lot over regular Risk. The theme works really well, and the Zombies add a constant threat. Defeating zombies is not too hard, but a couple of bad rolls can cause a couple of zombies to become a horde. The zombies also change how the game is played, because players have to be more defensive. Leaving one guy behind in a territory is a good way to get him killed. I also really like the way the even cards control the end of the game. The game will last between 4 to 7 turns, which is just right. When the game ends is uncertain, and never drags on for too long. I also think the board is well designed, as there are no “Australia” choke points on the map.

This game is challenging as you not only fight each other player, but also the walking dead too.
The undead are a fifth element to game play and can pop up anywhere, (usually where they are most trouble).

I shall avoid it, like the plague it is... and yet, it is a fantastic source for minis, D-6's and cardboard, so it's not a total loss. Should be turning up in thrift stores soon after January.

My son received this game from his older brother for his 16th birthday. At first I wasn't too excited about 'another Risk' game as my rating for Risk [6], has a strong nostalgic component to it, however, although you can see the Risk portion in the game, it has been changed enough to be it's own game. It captures the theme of The Walking Dead very well. Although it is not 100% necessary to attack the other player(s), you also have to protect yourself from the walking dead who spontaneously show up more frequently and in greater numbers for each turn. It is difficult and interesting as you try to use you limited resources against both the walking dead and your opponents. To the designers, well done gents, well done.

Very chaotic, with zombies attacking random board spaces at the beginning of each player turn.  Bonus thematic enjoyment: If a zombie kills a dude, the corpse has a 50/50 chance of returning as a zombie and joining the walking horde.

Players can freely attack each other or the zombies, though players get a +1 on their dice if engaged in zombie combat.  To add another layer of zaniness, players draw event cards that whack random players, though some are short-term missions that bestow temporary benefits if fulfilled. 

Possibly the shortest and silliest of all the Risk variants, which can only be a good thing.

RATING: 8.7
Probably one of the better 2 player light weight Risk variant. The zombies make for great neutral armies in 2 players. More than 2 players the game is still good but there are much better Risk games for when you have more people.

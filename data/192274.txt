For the solo game I would give a 9.
For the co-op, I'd give a 7, it's very susceptible to alpha gaming.

Interesting co-op that uses a mancala mechanism for gameplay. Interested in playing at least a couple more times.

An interesting take on the Forbidden Island style coop collection game. It plays on a circular static board, and your options reduce as you play due to lost workers and increasing cost of the win items, rather than a shrinking board.

Have only played a solo game so far, using 2 characters. I won and didn't find it too difficult, although may have had a lucky game. The difficulty scales in an interesting way, but the fact everyone shares the same pieces means play feels more reactive than tactical. Will need to play with more people to get a feel for the coop nature, but it didn't thrill me solo.

Very intense Co-op game. Not so keen on theme now. Always loses out to other co-ops.

Played this with a friend who likes co-op games but isn't a huge gamer. We picked it up quickly and she really enjoyed it. We'll have to try 3-4 players to find out how the balance is. Will definitely be going back on the game stack to choose from in the future.

A very good solo game. 

Not sure i would even want to play it with a group as it feels like a solo game with co-op added on. 

Have zero connection to the mythos its based on as well.

[Played 6 times]

Simple but not banal, with some "avalanche" issues (if you start losing, you'll hardly recover; if you do well, you may cruise to victory without ever feeling "in danger").

Quick (so it does not overstay its welcome).

There are decisions to ponder, but not so many options (pro: avoid analysis paralysis, con: not very deep and thus limited replay value).

Very clever, very neat, and it comes in at the right timeframe. You "Mancala" your guys around the board to pick up chits (too many chits at a spot and it explodes, more are added each turn), and gradually turn in more and more collected chits to advance the win condition by moving guys off the board. But moving guys off the board means there are less guys available to pick up chits, just when you need to collect even more chits to win! Horribly delicious. It's easy to do one good move, but to plan ahead enough moves to ensure the first one is the right one is, as Mancala experts would know, just a little tricky. There's no hidden information, so it's actually a solo game with a potential alpha director issue, but Mancala is hard so having multiple heads discussing options works for us. And just when you think you've almost won, it starts spiraling out of control!! Nice theme, nice artwork, nice components - nice production.

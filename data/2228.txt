Looks good for it's time, evokes the atmosphere if you are into Lord of the Rings and you can feel the tension mount as the fellowship approach the Mines of Moria while the Dark Lord marshalls his forces and searches for the ring bearer. Then it all falls flat. The Rohan march up to the gates of Isengard and kick the crap out of Saruman. Lightning raids by Gondorian forces pin the Varags and Haradrim on the southern road forcing the Sauron player to use his shadow points defending against Free People attacks, or the Dark Power Player gathers his forces quickly and stomps on Minas Tirith then sits guarding Barad Dur until he captures the ring. There are various house rules around that allegedly solve these problems. Havn't tried any of them.

A beautiful, ambitious thing to behold. 98% of your enjoyment will come from laying out the magnificent board, looking at the beautiful cards and pieces, and reading the rules. The game itself is a gigantic let-down.

RATING: 9
The map is exquisite, the counters not bad and the game quite good. My only critic is that every game is much the same (strategically speaking) with a big fight for Minas Tirith.
Better with the 3-players game, where Saruman has a hard time to play his role while trying not to infuriate Sauron.
I think advanced rules would have made it a blast (like special rules for orcs, trolls, cavalry units, Mumakils, etc.).

Great Berg design. Early use of cards for characters and some random events meant the Balrog dodn't always show up in Moria, and Gandalf didn't have to die ( although it made sense to kill him off early). Military game was fairly simple, but overall a great package. Have variant rules for a 3 player game Sauron,Saruman and the free peoples.

Loved the theme but not the game.  Slightly lower rating for the wargame - far too fiddly and unthematic - and slightly higher rating for the character game, which at least doesn't last forever - though the ringwraiths do queue up like gentlemen to take their turn at being beaten by Gandalf! 

For proper Tolkein games I recommend ICE's Middle Earth Card Game http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1915 and the Phalanx 'War of the Ring' http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9609

RATING: 3
Dreadful game, with a variety of rather serious issues, but the victory conditions are the true show-stopper, broken in the extreme. Classic SPI garbage foisted off on a non-discriminating customer base. Two mini-games included in some versions (Sauron and Gondor) are a little better, but still bad.

RATING: 3
My BF's dad dug this out of the garage when he discovered we were into boardgames and let me borrow it so I could go over the (godawful) rulebook and learn to play. The best thing I can say about this game is how much it makes me appreciate how far the medium has come since 1977.

The main problems I have:
1. The board is too big, made of three segments that don't fit well together, and the movement hexes are way too small and numerous. Each hex is marked with a TINY number indicating its location coordinates, which will give you a headache before the game even starts because you need to read them to set up the pieces. Also, some of the hexes have special "magic" markings in red. The mountains on the map are reddish brown. Most of those magic hexes are in mountains and they are virtually impossible to see since the markings are practically the same color.

2. Each character and army unit is represented by a painfully small thin cardboard counter. The lettering is smaller than even that of the hexes, so if you didn't have a headache from setting up the game, then you will definitely get one from identifying your units. When you have more than one unit on a hex, you stack them, which results in giant flimsy towers that fall over at the slightest table shake. Seriously, if a butterfly flew by and farted, it would knock over the entire Fellowship.

3. The cards don't give the full description of their effects, and some of them are misprinted resulting in errata included in the (godawful) game manual. You will need to reference the (godawful) manual before playing almost every card to see what it does. Some card entries in the (godawful) manual reference different sections. I had to flip through to check three different sections just to see how to play the card that said "Gollum attempts to seize the ring." Even though there was plenty of empty space on the card to fit a better description. Also, the text on that specific card said that it could only be played by the evil player, and the manual pointed out that this was incorrect and could actually be played by anyone.

4. The combat is boring and requires extremely painful bookkeeping to keep track of all your units wounds and "ring fatigue." I'm not going to go into it in detail, but the game comes with a few sheets of paper with all the units and boxes next to their names to keep track of zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....Usually I love dice, but this game even manages to ruin that. To determine the results of combat, you subtract your morale from your combat rating and then roll the die and compare it to a chart zzzzz...

5. The manual is just. plain. bad. Too many sections reference other sections, and the info is just heaped on you like cement from a mixer. Every now and then there's some flavor from the books, which is nice, but not enough to distract from the boring mechanic descriptions. Oh, and the text is pretty small too, not enough to complain about on its own, but extremely painful when compounded with the rest of the tiny lettering in this game.

There is a good game here somewhere. The theme is well utilized and there are a lot of interesting mechanics. War of the Ring has been successfully re-tooled with a better map, miniatures, and a super fun dice combat system. 

The '77 version is interesting as a relic, a stepping stone to the terrific games that we currently play. But like playing an old video game or watching one of the cartoons from our youth, it's almost embarrassing that we actually enjoyed something so terrible. Some things are better left in the past.

RATING: 8
(not owned: I own Middle Earth where it appears along with Gondor and Sauron, see  [gameId=144845])

I've voted 8 for the Characters Game. The Campaign game is, IMO, unbalanced against the Dark Forces (unless you aim to a draw, keeping all of the units inside Mordor - which would leave the Fellowship player to stay outside and wait the end of the game...): it's too hard AND slow to siege citadels; so, till now, I've never seen a Sauron military victory at the Campaign game.

RATING: 7
Every game of WotR I have played (always the campaign game which includes a character game within a war game) has ended up with a huge fight on the slopes of Mount Doom between the Fellowship and the minions of the Dark Lord. Yes, the game is predictible, but I never really cared much about that. Romping through Middle Earth with your favorite characters is always a blast for me. I typically played the three player version even though Saruman has a very small chance for victory (always fun to try though).  One big problem with this game is that it is out of print and getting a complete copy for a reasonable price is a challenge.

Flawed wargame in my opinion. I tried to like it. The theme is the only redeeming value this has.

Worth having.  The campaign game needs re-worked but the rpg part is interesting if you are willing to fudge a little.  The two tactical level games are actually fairly decent.  I mean, how many wargames do you have that feature boiling oil and severed heads as catapult ammo? :)

RATING: 6
I have a passion for this game, with its grand scope and attention to details. However it fails as a simulation of the book in several major ways, and as a game usually has a tendency to go along the same road every time. Many of the problems can be easily corrected by house rules however.

Bought this on release, kept it for 20 years, and then put it in the bin - just before the LOTR film craze and the massive prices offered for it on Ebay. Bugger! Truth to tell, this was a mediocre and largely unplayable game though, which was so buggy it caused much swearing and hair tearing. House rules improved it a little, but the whole thing was really a lost cause from the start. I wanted to love it for 20 years, but ended up hating it. Look somewhere (anywhere) else for your LOTR fix.... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game but it never quite hits the mark.  I keep fiddling with the rules to make it more faithful to the books.  The search rules in particular don't quite work.  The Dark player knows that the fellowship is heading for Mordor. Hard to avoid that knowledge.  

Back to tinkering...

I used to play and liked a lot this game and if I have to admit that the game was somewhat broken and never catched the spirit of Tolkien even if the was so cool in his time.

I had bought two copies on ebay to replace my lost one.

When the new War of the Ring appeared in 2004, I realised the game was now completely surpassed and definitely outdated by this tremendous release.

I now have to save my two copies only as collector items. I think I will never play the game anymore.

This was a much better idea in theory than in practice.  The early stages where the dark Lord was trying to find the Ring didn't make much sense - unless you deliberately broke up the Fellowship, he knows where it is.  How can that be right?  And the no-stacking limits wargame part was just mad.  My stack of 27 Orcs totals 705-I'm not kidding the numbers really add up... doesn't have quite the same feel to it as the relevant chapters in the book.  Check out Calandale's video of solo playing it - it really captures the feel.

Berg-SPI version.  Two games in one.  One is a simple character game where the fellowship players play hide and seek over a hex map to dunk the golden donut.  The full wargame is a rather deep game with lots of counters.  The trouble is, with such a vast playing area, the action is really only at a few key points (ie. read the book).  Some of the best Tolkien art on the cards.  The Nexus version of 2004 is a mile ahead of this.

It's really not that good of a game.   The game forces you to kill off poor old Gandalf as fast as possible so he can come back as the stronger Gandalf the White, and it's really just about pootling around until the Mount Doom confrontation.  There isn't much point of contact between the character game and the army game.  A brave attempt to graft the character element on to a wargame, but Swords & Sorcery did it so much better, even if it had an unconscionable abundance of puns.  Yes it's a nice map of Middle Earth for the 70's, but look at the state of the hobbits on the character cards, and what sort of tired old fetish is the Balrog living out with that pathetic little whip?

This was my favorite game for quite a few years after it came out.  Others whine about the balance but with a simple fix to (literally) 2-3 rules you have an VERY indepth WARgame treatment of The War of the Ring that can be played with 2-5 players in a single evening.

Finally snagged another copy off of eBay I can afford!  Hard mounted boards and mint!  Yeeha!

The SPI version.  Complicated and hard for the Fellowship player to win under any circumstances.  But I do remember really digging the Campaign Game, with its scads of Rohan, Gondor and Mordor tiles led by famous characters from the book.  The same guy who failed at Luftwaffe with me was my only opponent in this (we were LOTR fanatics as well as WWII aircraft nuts) and again, we were too young to really handle this game.

RATING: 3
Very fond childhood memories.  The atmosphere of the game is excellent, especially the campaign game.  But, repeated plays often end up being decided by a final battle on Mount Doom with the Fellowship vs the Nazgul, so marks of for that.

Traded my copy away for Breakout Normandy.

RATING: 10
Just finished playing the first game for a few years and despite the mega stacks of armies it was a lot of fun. Finished in a very bloody fellowship victory as the ring was destroyed. Only the four hobbits of the original fellowship survived. Galadriel, Theoden, Eomer and Faramir also fell along with the Balrog, Shelob, Lord of the Nazgul, Gothmog and three other Nazgul. 

Minas Tirith fell to a huge Haradrim army led by the Lord of the Nazgul, Helm's Deep fell to Saruman and poor Hobbiton was swamped by the Dunlendings. Helm's Deep was eventually retaken by a massive Rohan and Elven army who the went on to take Isengard in a very bloody series of battle rounds. The Gondorians were being chased back for a last stand at Dol Amroth pursued by the Haradrim when the ring was destroyed.

Really frustrating as the Dark Power player to keep coming up with 8s and 9s on the shadow point table. Hordes of orcs never made it far out of Mordor for lack of points to move them. I did manage to spot the Fellowship on turn 2 allowing a nice early deployment of Sauron's forces. Just love those Haradrim 50-7 cavalry. Don't waste time moving them when they arrive as they really drain the shadow points. Just let them build up for a few turns then launch a nice big stack at a pre-mobilised Gondor and watch their pieces turn even paler.

The Fellowship may have won by destroying the ring, but looking at the board at the end it is difficult to see a happy ending for them. Other that the Gondorian army in Dol Amroth, the Rohirrim are devastated which leaves Brand, Dain and Thranduil with some scattered forces in the North. Meanwhile they might be leaderless, but there are stacks of Saurin's orcs and Haradrim left. And as for Hobbiton, that's now Dunlendingville.

Love this game -- the old SPI version, that is. Great map, pretty decent cards and a zillion counters. We played this to death one summer long ago with Beatles tunes as a soundtrack. No connection other than we were especially into Tolkien and the Fab Four at the time.  I seem to remember there were certain event triggers that would seal a victory for either side. Still, love this game.

War of the Ring is a great adaptation of the Lord of the Rings to a wargame medium, well capturing the feel of the eponymous war, but falls short in terms of gameplay, as the vast majority of the Campaign Game, the command of armies, influences the probability of winning very little. Also, character combat is resolved as a series of duels, allowing one character to defeat a host of others quite easily. It's a lot of fun to play, but design mistakes were made.

Flavorful treatment of the material.  Fantastic map, great SPI counters.  Plays well for its age and the order of event card play keeps it interesting.  Captures some great elements of the books smoothly into the gameplay.  With a few very minor tweaks and variants (i.e. Nazgul camping in Mordor unless character spotted there), easily a 10.  The second edition has almost no errata and plays cleanly.  Highly recommended "golden age" SPI fantasy game.  Designed in such a way that die-hard fanatics can alter the design to suit their personal taste without breaking the game.  

The campaign game also successfully marries individual combat with army combat allowing character/army interaction complete with leadership effects and sorcery.  This is no small achievement and deserves appreciation.  If you can't tell by now, I'm a big supporter of this game.

I greatly prefer the Campaign Game, because pushing big stacks of armies around is more to my liking.  However, I do recommend making yourself some force sheets to eliminate the need to move those towers around 'on map'.

Mounted board edition.

This is the "Designer's Edition" with the ocher colored box and mounted maps.

The box shows the wear you'd expect after 40 years. It is sound for the most part, though one corner seems about to split. It is 100% complete, and looks to have been barely, if at all played. The cards are all flat as pancakes, true to color, with sharp unblemished edges. One card's back has laminating tear, but the front is perfect.

The counters that are punched are carefully and minimally clipped. About 40% were semi-punched and left as sticks. Original micro dice are included.

The rule book looks fresh off the press. My uncle made very minimal notes in this one, from quick glance amounting to a single 'x' outside one case.

The reference sheets are flat, sharp and unblemished. The boards are crisp and flawless.

Basically the game once you open the box, is "Like New" or Excellent. It is in extremely great shape. Whatever the price band is for this title, this copy would be comparable to the very best of those that were actually in circulation / use.

This game was largely designed in an afternoon, and it shows, being a typically half-baked Berg effort from SPI.  The military and character aspects do not mesh, with the former being almost irrelevant.  Weird and wildly implausible combat systems, bits of chrome which do not gel, a vast map, little of which is ever used, flimsy cards.  I can't see why anyone would now want to play this given all the far better alternatives.

This old SPI game has some excellent design elements and it is very thematic. In some ways it is even better than the new Ares War of the Ring [a very high praise indeed].

Having absolutely zero interest in spending hours pushing 400 counters around the map that the Campaign game demands, I did however crank through the rules and play out the Character game that concentrates on getting the Fellowship chits past the Nazgul chits. This simple concept is hampered by page after page of rules, chrome, exceptions, look-up tables, character specifics and every other old-school fault you could come up with. It also delivers far too few interesting decisions and relies far too much on luck (nazgul can't attack without successful searches for example, and if the dice don't go your way ... straight on come the fellowship). Turns are straightforward for both players - the fellowship may split up and travel different ways being the only major decision, and the Nazgul try to search (eg identify the components of the fellowship travelling parties so they can then have a whack at them and steal the Ring) or they whack citadels. Events are unbalanced, most being largely irrelevant but some can be key to success for both parties. Combat is a drawn out CRT table dice driven affair without cleverness. All in all, this was as an exercise in frustration and boredom and a sorry waste of time learning and playing. This theme is far better serviced by the newer generation of games introduced over the last 10 years.

I owned this game for many years, but can't find it now.  A great wargame with the interesting (and necessary) twist of character cards.

Others have commented, and I agree, that the Fellowship wins too often.  House rules can make it a little easier for Ringbearers to be corrupted, and that can even out the game play.

For old-school, counter-stacking, take 90-minutes-to-set-the-dang-thing-up fun, this is a winner.

An excellent means to introduce the kids to serious gaming. The allure of going beyond "kiddie" games will prove irresistible, especially if you play the "this is an adult game" card. And those kids will give you a serious challenge once they master the rules.

I found that the basic game doesn't impress much. The Campaign Game is the way to go. Just sneaking the Fellowship around is far too simplistic and dull. Marching whole armies around is what they love, I found.

The Old Man here takes the onerous task of playing Sauron, of course- the kids split the Fellowship between them. I tend to act as more of a DM than a player; my object is not victory but enjoyment for the young'uns.

I know, I know, I haven't played the game and I'm rating it a 3.  BUT I can tell you right now I will probably NEVER play this game.  Oh I've managed to get it (for a steal actually), but it's just too darn complex for my tastes.  All those hexes, chits, character record sheets, bleh!   It's just not worth it...I'll NEVER be able to teach it to a non-gamer. Granted, back in the day, this was probably the BEST attempt to "recreate" the events in the novel.  BUT, I now have the new War of the Ring, which, quite frankly, puts this one to shame.  People who hate on the new War of the Ring should check this dog out.  Oh, and all you fools out there who are paying $100+ for this game on ebay, good luck finding someone to play with, cause it ain't goin' be easy!

We liked this game and I started to improve it.  I added lots of smaller groups like Giants and Ents which could ally with either side.  I beefed up Sauraman by allowing him to make his own (lesser) ring of power.  (These rules were well thought out and DID add to the game.)  

I added more and more and more, until this long game became completely unplayable.  That experience taught me a lot about game design... 

My six rating is as the game is out of the box.  If I were to rate the game with most of my changes it would be a 7 or 7.5.  That is, I would clearly prefer playing with some of my house rules, but I need to sit down and toss out the ones that add the most to the playing time.

RATING: 5
This is a great effort.  It's really cool that Berg did a LotR game.  This map is attractive and accurate.  But when it comes down to it, this just isn't a good game.  It's not a fault of the design, really, but the book doesn't lend itself to a wargame interpretation very well.  All the armies and battles are rendered pointless, because everything really depends on the fate of the Ring.  Ultimately not very fun, unless you're just extremely hyped about Tolkien whilst playing.

Ye olde SPI version.  Played to completion exactly once circa 1982.  Was fun but unlikely to be repeated with all the new Tolkien goodies on the market that look more attractive.

RATING: 8
One of the best LOTR games ever.  Some glaring rules problems, especially concerning sieges and personal combat.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Otherwise, this game would rate a perfect 10.  This rating may drop when the new War of the Ring comes out, but I doubt it.

Game dropped slightly since I've gotten the new War of the Ring.  Different enough from the new version to maintain its appeal.  Nostalgia definitely factors into my rating, originally a 9.

RATING: 5.7
War of the Ring is in my opinion an
incoherent and failed design which 
could have been great but did not 
succeed.

Granted this is a Charles Roberts award
winning game from a famous designer;
however, reputation cannot make good
for fundamental flaws, even if it is Richard
Berg.

The basic problem with the game as it 
is is that 90% of the game activity is 
wasted and  can have no relevance to 
winning or losing the game.

Against any skilled opponent there is no 
real chance of a military victory. Thus 
this 90% of activity in the game is by and 
large completely irrelevant.

On the bright side the poor game design 
can be salvaged by a simple house rule 
to remedy the situation.

My rule to remedy the situation is to affect
Character morale by the gain or loss of
Citadels. (2 citadel/morale point for the
Fellowship and Dark players and 1/citadel
for Sauramun.

Thus instead of having all the army combat
Being completely irrelevant in an incoherent
game design; now with this simple rule players
Fight tooth and nail over citadels and the armies
become a vital factor in winning or losing the
game.

Thus instead of an incoherent game design the
game becomes integrated with the armies having
Vital relevance .

This is an excellent game when correcting as above
the game original designer flaws; but as the game
Itself stands it is a very flawed and imperfect result.

Beautiful game, and I rarely use that adjective to describe one.  And they make Peter Jackson's attempts to remain true to Tolkein's books (and he did a fine job) look like an amateur. There is absolutely nothing from those books I can find that can't be found somewhere in this game---on an event card or as a character, or a magic item.

Bought this as a plastic cover version - presumably 2nd hand.  While faithful to the great book and remarkably playable as far as movement and combat is concerned, it is conceptually flawed as the players know what the object of the game is (whereas in the book, the object of the quest had to be first resolved).

The map was beautifully and remarkably accurately presented and the playing pieces where very professionally produced.  A good game - which can take a long time.

The classic SPI game - A good fantasy wargame, but the target audience is even thinner than the new FFG War of the Ring, mostly due to the fact that the game is significantly longer and the bits aren't as nice.  I searched long and hard for this one, paid too much when it was in high demand, and will probably never get it to the table again due to a lack of interested opponents!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I'm a fan of the Tolkien universe, so it's not a stretch that my viewpoint is somewhat biased.  It's a product of its era, and far less immediately entertaining than the 21st century update (which really isn't a translation of this game, though many elements are similar due to the common source material/inspiration).  Lots of paper/chits and bits--fiddly bits, fiddly bits, fiddly bits!  Anyone who is a lover of the 70s era chit-and-counter terrain/conquest/war games should enjoy this, and those who like that genre and enjoy Tolkien would definitely want to find a copy.  If memory serves, there were several printings of this game, and a handful of different artwork as well.  I have two different copies, one with the "cartoony" art (can't remember the artist's name--someone let me know??) and the other more classic/mustard-colored box that includes the Sauron and ???? expansions.

I picked this up in a second hand market on holiday as a child. It was probably the first game with 100s of counters I bought, and thus had a formative role in shaping my later interests. However, the rules never really seemed to work - there seemed to be massive holes in them (although, maybe in my youth I just didn't understand them). A few years ago I tried to play the three player version, but all that happened was the Fellowship allied with Saruman and they holed up with all their forces in Minas Tirith, creating a stalemate. We may well have been playing something wrong, but it wasn't a great experience.

Actually I never found anyone willing to play this with me and I've owned since the early 1980's when it was passed on to me by an older game afficianodo. So my rating is based on my familiarity more than playability of this game. As a kid I loved Tolkien's classics, the artwork is fabulous, the pieces and modular box designed to hold everything was well ahead of its time, the hexagonal map although fixed is supremely detailed. The rules are rich and deep, delightfully complex for a fan of the Trilogy, but daunting even for the average game fan back then.

Man, this game is silly. So much chrome and hundreds of counters to wet your appetite while going through the rules, and then an uninteresting hunt system combined with an embarrassing military subgame where the optimal evil player strategy is just piling up troops around Mount doom and waiting for the ring to fall into his lap. A slightly better, but still irrelevant, game with the abstracted military system.

Edit: might be (the above) but, at a second crack of doom, I'm actually having some good fun by playing the 3-player version. Decisions here might be less obvious than one might be first led to believe. And it does create pretty unique, epic narratives around that ring of power.

RATING: 7
The Middle Earth feel is there all right but it will only be fun if what you&#039;re actually looking for is a reenaction of the book.

The wargame part is almost irrelevant to victory, it&#039;s very hard to win with Sauron and close to impossible with Saruman (it takes superlative luck).

RATING: 5
Ambitious, but a bit broken.  Sauron's impulse movement allows him to try something, fail, and then try again with more troops in the same turn.  Had one enjoyable play on this, and three or four others where it started strong and then just went on too long and too tedious.

Still to early to pass judgement. Wanted to see what the fuss was about... I've played a couple of turns with a friend, made a big blunder that rendered the rest of the game unplayable and was too late to start over. It seemed quite nice but I can see where players have problems with it. Moving around and being active with the evil player seems pointless. You can achieve victory just by gathering strenght near mount doom and waiting for the good guys to do all the work...

My first board game, and I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for it.  That said, it's a whole lot of little cardboard army chits that have to be set up, the vast majority of which will never be moved, and even fewer that will have any impact on the outcome.  

The leader/character concept and the event cards were pretty novel for the time, but the more recent War of the Ring captures all the good from this game and relieves it of all its cumbersome war game rule baggage.

Probably the best War of the Ring game out there, but old and very expensive to purchase.  There are numerous problems with balance and gameplay, eg, the dark side can simply camp out at Mount Doom and wait for the Fellowship....But, there is a web presence for the game, with many rules that fix most of the problems.  Probably the best game for hardcore wargamers, since it has (gasp) hexes.

I bought this game when I was getting into D&D and right after reading the Tolkien books.
Didn't think at first that it could be much good. I think I was wrong. The wargame element was pretty fun. And the character part of the game only enhanced the experience.
The game got damaged some years ago and some of the parts appear to be gone. It's a real shame because the new movies on the subject that have recently come out have created a new interest with my kids. But I just can't play it anymore due to the missing parts. And I'm not even sure what they are!
The map still is something to look at. It got brought out the last time we watched the trilogy and my grandkids were able to follow the characters progress using the map.
A lot of the gamers in our club liked playing this too. Interestingly, many of them defected to D&D as the years passed and slowly stopped wargaming.

House rules can revive this old classic.  The old PBM rules which detail a double blind system really capture the flavor and fog-of-war of the situation.  And rules which limit skulking in Mordor around Mt. Doom are also necessary (really, did Richard Berg not see that one coming?  Unbelievable). With these two mods, it can be an interesting game. This was the first REAL middle earth immersion piece and therefore it holds a sentimental place.  However, for the game as written I'd likely give it a 4.

overall in great shape... a few of the cards have some slight discoloration were they were held together by a metal clip - maps, rules in excellent condition. I have not inventoried the chits.

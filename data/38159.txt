130929 I just don't like the moderator and special power aspects of this game.  I much prefer resistance now.

121231 Fun convention party game.  Not sure I'd like it that much with a smaller group, maybe would prefer to try Saboteur or something.  Even the Resistance fell flat the couple times I tried playing that game.

[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Did not enjoy. Seems like Mafia in small groups, didn't have a chance to play with more players. Also suffered under a horrendous storyteller, which left me cold to this game pretty much until the end of time. I've never been a fan of Mafia to begin with (I find it slow, mostly boring, and stilted), so adding specialized cards and new abilities didn't do it for me. 

Once you're eliminated; you're done, just sit there. The narrator is doing EVERYTHING in this game and the hidden info just isn't compelling to me. A much better variation on this basic concept is [thing=134352][/thing] which keeps everyone involved and playing a part in the game. 

Not Recommended.

Player elimination sucks. It really does, particularly when you don't even get to defend yourself on the first turn. 

Also needing 8+ sucks. 

If this game gets the right group, it's a 10. Unfortunatley, that's super-rare.

Waiting to test this on an unsuspecting crowd.

Update: Played a few rounds with the family.  Some didn't seem to get it.  We played with six including me as the moderator.  That wasn't quite enough people, I can see this coming into its own with 7-11 players.  I enjoyed it and it was certainly easy to jump into, and with all the extra cards plenty of space to explore.

Pros
- Plays up to an insane number of people
- Sense of being scared once you've survived for so long 
- So many different roles and ways to mix and match them. Easy to customize
- With a good moderator, a good tale can be weaved 
- Best when played at 9-19 players. If you want to play more, get more roles that have a lot of killing and less roles that protect people
- If playing with mostly new people, always balance towards the Villagers and work down from there

Cons
- Player elimination. It's not so bad as long as you keep the numbers down 
- A moderator is needed. He/She needs to be good and aware of the roles and keep the game on track. It can be fun, but someone has to be the moderator.

Just got this and played a few seven player games not including moderator. The set up was a basic 1 Wolf, 1 Seer, 5 villagers. More often than not the villagers spotted the Werewolf straight away there were many poor werewolf performances. My hosting wasn't very good either. Still it went over pretty well and was enjoyed.

RATING: 3
Fun party game, better than most.  It's fun to do some role playing and come up with weird reasons why people should be lynched.  I though player elimination would be a problem, but there's still some interesting observations and entertainment to be had if you're dead.  It's a game I'd definitely want to play with a lot of people, though I don't know that I'd want to go to the upper limit.

2016 EDIT: Over time, I've grown to loathe this game.  It's just not fun for me anymore.  It's just way too random, and the player elimination just sucks all of the interest out of the game.  Plus, with so many roles in the game, it's really tough to keep everything straight.  On the other hand, VILLAGERS ARE BORING.  My rating keeps dropping.

I must say the only thing of which I like the Estonian version more is this game but I bought it in case I have some English-speaking people playing. It gives alot of extra roles but once I played with 20+ people it got too chaotic and hard to follow cause you simply don't hear what the other side of the table is talking. Some of the extra roles are weird and some are combos which make some roles way too overpowered.

Anyhow, it gives alot of tools for the game master and with a good game master - this game can become great.

I have a group of friends who ONLY want to play this game, which makes it really fun. They vastly prefer this one to Resistance: Avalon because of it's free form and because of the theme and various special roles. I'm yet to play with more than 7 people but I imagine the game really pops with a group of 10. It isn't every day I have a group this big willing to play so I haven't gotten tired of playing, though I've owned it for years.

While there are many games with very sophisticated mechanics that just don't produced engaged game play, Werewolf can barely be said to have any mechanics at all but the few rules there are produce - with the right group - an awful lot of fun. This edition of Werewolf is the one to get and the creators absolutely have given added value to a game system that in its simplest form could be summed up on the back of business card. The extra roles offer clever variations and the suggestions made do a lot to allow you to have the best game you can. If you have the right group and the numbers are right (10+), I can't think of a better party game.

I was a little disappointed by this game.  I think it's probably because the hype before it was so high that I was expecting to see a particularly interesting diplomacy game, where careful observation and a collection of information could help reach conclusions.

In our games, reasoning for lynchings tended to be "he's too quiet" or "i just think so", which is really not what I had in mind.  While it appears to me that there's potentially some depth, with players analyzing motives and roles by carefully considering how everyone has votes, that simply didn't seem to happen with the group I played with.  Perhaps it's more a question of having the right group.   Would try it again and reconsider this rating of 5.

I really wanted to like this one because it is games with heavy interaction that I really appreciate.

Jan 2011:  rating dropped to a 4.  Player elimination makes this game a near deal breaker to me.

The resistance is superior in most ways.

The granddaddy of social deduction is showing its age. There's not really much of a game here. It's a random killing fest where being suspicious early on will turn into watching TV for an hour while everyone else finishes. The roles add some interest and intrigue to the game, and some combinations do make things enjoyable. It doesn't change the fact that the game is overwhelmingly random and chaotic, and certain roles only make that worse. If there's a group of 20 people, I'd consider werewolf, or I could just bring in a second copy of the Resistance and play a better game.

This is an excellent improvement to a great game. This is a must have for all gamers. 

Its an expanded version of Werewolf. It may help the problem that I've gotten sick of it. Tom Vasel said that the manual has many good tips on how to run a good game. It includes lots of new roles. Can play w/ as little as 5 players. 

This game can wear down if too many kids are involved. There needs to be a fun balance of kids and parents. It’s particularly fun when its all adults - the strategy begins to kick in.

I like Werewolf, but I don't like that there is nothing to base any of your claims off of. You can make guesses as to why someone would kill so and so in which order, but I will often just kill random people as the Werewolf and that means there is nothing to go off of.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a neat version of the classic Werewolf game.  It has far more cards than other packaged versions, and it seems to be fairly balanced.  The artwork is good, though not always my style.  The rulebook is helpful--especially the ideas for splitting a large group into multiple villages that are playable with just this set of cards.

The cards include the name of the role, but no further text.  The advantage here is that it is relatively language independent, and these cards can be pressed into service as other roles not included or as variants of these roles.  The disadvantage is that one needs to print out play-aids, if a wide variety of special roles are used.

Verdict: The best available package-set for Werewolf.  I might have made a few changes, if I were the publisher of this game, but overall the positives strongly outweigh the negatives.

This game has been such a hit with our office board game nights. It's by far the most talked about game and seems to have really captured everybody's interest. The variety of special roles is giving the game legs as well. Ultimately it's one of the few party games that support the size of group we typically have (~15 players).  As a moderator I really enjoy using music (Bram Stoker's Dracula) and lighting to add atmosphere to the game.  

The only downside I'm starting to see is that people can be too smart for their own good.  If the same group plays regularly then the wolves target these players early on.  If those players last more than two or three nights then the villagers conclude that they must be a wolf and they get lynched.  Either way it makes for a short game for those people.

I started with Werewolves of Miller's Hollow and recently upgraded to this Ultimate edition. This is THE werewolf game to buy. Having character descriptions written ON the cards is a moderator life saver. (Just don't get caught reading too often if you are a special villager.) The cards are standard sleeve size, which is great for huge BYOB gatherings. FORTY great roles to play with and a balancing system ON the cards for moderators to build a great experience. The rule book is full of great ideas. I LOVE this edition of werewolf.

If you have a large group of people, especially at a convention, this is simply the best game of its type.  Intrigue, variable roles, constant tension, and a story arc that is guaranteed to provoke conversation well after the game is over.  This Ultimate Edition makes the game even better by helping the Moderator balance the sides more effectively, giving the group a better play experience overall, as well as taking the guesswork out of many of the special roles that can be involved in a game of Werewolf.  This is a must-have for any convention in my opinion.

I love this game because of Mafia principle. The ultimate game when there are more than 10 people overnight and want to play games.
It has two main flaws, though. It requires a moderator who must closely follow the whole game and there is a mandatory player elimination each round which can be really unfortunate for players that are eliminated early in the game.

This is a great game to play with a large group of people.  It's fun even when you've been eliminated to see how the rest of the game plays out.  It's good regardless of whether the people playing are gamers or not.  Best of all, you don't even need to purchase this game, you can just use cue cards and write down the roles without purchasing the game.  Some of the benefits of this edition over others is that it has a lot different roles, the cards are like normal playing cards instead of squares (which means I can sleeve them =) ), and it has an awesome rulebook.  This alone makes it worth actually buying a copy of Werewolves and beyond that you'll be getting the definitive version of the game, in my humble opinion.  The only negative thing I can say about this game is that it requires about a minimum of 10 people to truly shine.  I like this but I don't like player elimination in my games and would never want to moderate it, therefore I will not own a copy.

It plays your entire family reunion. Beyond that, it serves the purpose of a "murder-mystery" style party, in a box you can carry in your glovebox. Feel a party has enough horror/scifi/fantasy fans to pull something off, with the ability to integrate everyone at said party? Only has one real problem...

A good moderator is also an experienced player, and unless that player is a convention go-er, odds are that potential moderator won't have the experience to maximize the game for the party. Bang the Dice game, Coup, or even plain old 2 role Resistance tends to work better.

That being said, with an experienced moderator, this game can be turned into a magical and insane experience.

Werewolf is a lot of fun and the Ultimate WW version is excellent.  The strength of WW is in the variety of roles and how they interact and the bluffing and tactics that arise from those combinations.  The downside is that it takes some work and some trial and error to come up with those good villages.

This really is the same game as The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow with a couple more roles thrown in.

And just like with its close relative the major issue I have is that for the most part it is merely an exercise in eloquence. There is nothing in the way of hard facts, no foundation to base your accusations on beyond "I may have heard him move tonight."

That doesn't mean you cannot have a good time with it, but as a game it is fairly pointless.

I love love love this game. I love the deduction, the secrecy, the bluffing and all that this can make players do, and a good game of werewolf will be remembered for a long time. It is very involved, and yes, you need to have a little bit of an active crowd for it, but then this game is a blast. The elimination is the only disadvantage to the game, even though it is very much part of the setting and the fun. You can adjust the game to any age range and level of complexity and it is great for big crowds. Lots of various ways to play and just always great fun. I also love making my own characters to add to the mix of all fun characters existing already.

Also own:
-Classic Movie Monsters
-Urban Legends
-Night Terrors
-Werewolf Pack
-Artifacts: I still need to try and use this some time. I think it will add a lot of fun and some more depth to the game and discussions.

This was a big hit for NMA* Game Fest.  I like moderating -- not sure I want to be a regular player.  I believe I have all the current card now.

I never imagined a game that only needs one card per player to play would get a 10. The components aren't lacking because you don't need much for this deceptively simple game.

I've introduced this to non-gamer parties, and gamer parties. It's very social, and is one of the reasons I play board games. It's to talk to people, and this game plays it very well. Some might say there is too much luck involved... but there is skill. People skills, Social skills. You can influence people very well in this game, and you can even roleplay a bit if you'd like. 

Yes, I would rather be playing Battlestar Galactica, but for what this game is, and what it aims to be: A suspicion lynching party game, it utterly succeeds. 10/10.

One of my favourite games. VERY different with different groups. I've played a lot with mixed groups of newcomers, which can feel strained because people aren't sure about lying. I've played with a group of very devious types who had much more fun after I encouraged them to be more dishonest. I had an amazing game with people I met at a dinner party for the Computer Science department at the University of Pittsburgh. I have played a lot with my friends from the BGG Werewolf forums, and there is nothing like it. There is so much to learn about social habits and psychology through games like this.

This is a fun game, and one that every one in my family (4 years and up) can play. We have a family of 7, and this game will work fine with 6 players (but is best with more). It is fun and can be shared really easy with non- board gamers at family events. I think this game can easily be rated a "10," but due to the nature of the game it is only a "10" when playing with a lot of people, and this only happens occasionally; thus, this is not an everyday game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like Werewolf, don't get me wrong. It is a wonderful party game, that is fun for all types of people, casual and gamer alike. It has intriguing strategy for both the werewolves and villagers and is always a welcome suggestion at game nights or gatherings.

HOWEVER, I do have a few key qualms: 

1. The need for a host really sucks. It SUCKS, because the game really cannot function without a great host, and if there isn't someone experienced and organized to be a host, the game will quickly fall apart. I actually think it can be really fun to be a host, however it's definitely not the same as playing the game, which means someone will always be losing out on the true Werewolf experience each game.

2. Player elimination. This isn't as big of an issue for me, but it is a negative. Luckily the game is fun enough to watch and see how everything unfolds, but even so it can be very discouraging to get killed early. Especially when one finally lands a cool role. Which brings me to my final qualm:

3. Imbalanced roles/lame villager problem. When playing the game as pure werewolves vs. villagers this isn't an issue, however when introducing any of the special roles there can be problems. The system for balancing the sides I think is not well designed because I've noticed certain roles being WAY more powerful than the game claims. For example, "The Ghost" character. It is such an advantageous character for the villagers, that I've yet to see a game in which the werewolves won with a Ghost present. Yet the game claims it is less powerful than say, a Seer. This leads to teams being "balanced" as per the game rules, but clearly being imbalanced during the actual play. The other problem with introducing the special roles is that it creates the issue of being a "lame" normal villager. Nobody wants to be a normal villager when special roles are present, and it sucks when you are. 

However, I still think it is a very fun game, and worthwhile any time someone suggests playing it.

I'm not a fan of all the special roles, but you can play without them.  Sometimes I'll play with them, especially if the game is timed.  The timer doesn't make the roles any better, but it at least constrains the game to a more reasonable time.

Since I played Werewolf for the first time (2010 I believe) I fell in love with the game. This is by far the best edition of the game out there. The rules are crystal clear and offer nice insights, there is a ton of roles and cards and the game is pretty easy to teach and learn. Pure fun.

It is just a great game to introduce to your family

I just love it.

Hidden roles is still my favorite mechanic, and I still love Werewolf, however I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings with the BGG recommended rating system. 

I still think this Ultimate Werewolf is the best Werewolf game out there and I plan to buy all the expansions for it.

Last time we played I was the first casualty (and that sucks a little), however I still had a fun time seeing the rest of the game (although perhaps that’s only me). It is also true that this game has lots of uncontrollable luck, but all things considered, I enjoy it a lot.

The real issue for me is that I hate to be the moderator. I feel that person doesn’t play at all. Fortunately, many friends love to do this so I don’t think I will have to do it anytime soon. 

My favorite “werewolf” game is The Resistance: Avalon, but it doesn’t replace Werewolf for me. 

One of 2008´s favorites.

Finding the group that is willing to go all in on the talking without continuing into actual abuse of other players is the toughest part of Werewolf, and 9 times out of 10 something like The Resistance is a better fit.

To me, this game is absolute perfection. Games with a horror slant to them are my favorite so from the spooky theme, to the fun of setting a creepy and thematic mood for the group (I can't stress enough how far a few candles and some great mood music go with this one), I love everything about it.

Yes it's a party game, but it's a party game with a hint of tabletop sophistication.  It's getting a bit harder these days to gather together 15-20 people to play, but when we do it's always a treat; everyone has a blast - and it's a great way to not only introduce people to gaming, but introduce people to other people in general.  Some people don't enjoy the idea of being eliminated, but frankly, that's what makes this game so enjoyably stressful. You WANT to stay in, and when you have a group of people who understand that fighting for your place in the village is how you play, watching the remaining players struggle with the swings after you've been eliminated (or as the moderator) is still hugely entertaining.

We've played this for hours on end and never seem to get tired of it.  There's always great discussion afterward (sometimes for days) and it's really fantastic for camaraderie and bringing friends together - even though you're probably trying to kill every single one of them...

RATING: 9
Pros: I really like the rulebook, which gives the best explanation I've seen of how to play and how to maximize the fun of the game.  I also really like the wide variety of roles, which provide for a lot of replayability.  But ultimately, the underlying game is a lot of fun.  Not something I'd want to play every night, but with people that are really into the game, there's nothing better.  The paranoia, lies and trickery are delicious and it's still fun to watch after you've been eliminated.  If you watch carefully enough it should really help you read people better in the future.

Cons: First off,the game is not for everyone.  Those that cannot handle chaos, that tend to analyze everything, and those that dislike player elimination will understandably not enjoy this game.  It is also highly group-dependent, as the right group can make the game shine, while others will shrug it off.

I'm not really a fan of the artwork, which seems a little cheesy/ugly.  It seems like they might have been going for the slightly retro look, but all in all I don't really like it.  At least you only have to look at the card once to know your role, then not use it again.  

I also really dislike the box, which is difficult to open with the faux-linen finish that is a mark of being made in China.

I purchased this version to get the Classic Movie Monsters and to have a backup copy.

I think that in general it's a good idea to have the text on each role's card, especially for newer players.  I can see how some would find it annoying, but you could just make everyone stare at their card for 5 seconds so that the specials are not more easily discerned.

It is weird how there's no more magician, I haven't noticed any other changes so far.  Great game.

The game is an all time classic, but at this point it's getting a little tiresome having to pay a pretty high price point just to get a handful of new cards. I understand why he does it, since cards are expensive to print, but I'm not sure how much longer I'll keep playing along.

A game of social deduction, this game provides a unique and entertaining experience time after time. It is easy to explain and very quick to play. For new groups it can take a round or two to get people ‘warmed up’ to the game and it helps a lot to have an experienced player or two in the mix. However, once the first round or two is behind them, this game really goes over really well with almost everyone and without fail you’ll end up playing several more games in a row.

The gist is that a few people are secretly assigned the role of werewolf and throughout the game they will slowly kill off the villagers while posing as villagers themselves. The villager’s job is to successfully identify and ‘lynch’ the wolves before all the real villagers have been eaten. The trick is that they have to do this with almost no real information so they must rely on ‘tells’, voting patterns, and other shaky ‘evidence’ to make their decisions. 

This is my absolute favorite game for larger groups (10-20 people) and I would highly recommend this game to almost anyone who can get a big enough group together.

Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition is the ultimate party game for anywhere from 5 to 68 players of all ages. Each player has an agenda: as a villager, hunt down the werewolves; as a werewolf, convince the other villagers that you're innocent, while secretly dining on those same villagers each night. Dozens of special roles are available to help both the villagers and the werewolves achieve their goals while thwarting their opponents.

Played this many times.  So far, my favorite role/card to be added to the base Werewolf game is:  The Cursed.  The Cursed is a villager who starts the game as a normal villager, but if the werewolves chooses or feeds on The Cursed, this villager becomes another werewolf.  I like games where The Cursed is added along with The Hunter but take out The Witch (b/c the healing potion just makes it a little too difficult for the werewolves to win.)

A game that I didn't think I would like, but found that I adore it.  

Enjoyment does depend a bit on your companions, but for the most part I have found it to be a fresh way of looking at your friends (is she showing too much teeth?).  

First round is not the most fun, but the rest of the game makes up for it (if you are not lynched, that is).

Got in Origins 2013 Math trade, traded away in 2013 BGF Match Trade.  I'm not a fan of the player elimination, and would basically rather play The Resistance than this.  If there's two many players for the latter, then it'd be worth it to play something else or split into groups, because for Werewolf to truly work, you have to have everyone engaged, and I feel like that is very hard to do with mixed players.

This ultimate edition adds too much to really experience it all in one or two sessions, especially with people new to the game.  However, some of the additions are a lot of fun.

The huge number of options available in this edition are a blast, making a game that's already a pleasure to play even better. It's just so satisfying to break out, relax, and socialize with Werewolf before splitting into smaller groups to play other games.

Having only played vanilla Werewolf, I love all of the additions and variants available in this version. The role balancing mechanism is especially useful -- that plus the card art and variety of roles make this worth the price of admission.

The cards could be made of slightly thicker stock, but they look good and the other components (rulebook and score pad) are excellent. I also like that the game came with card baggies as well as a useful box liner.

These kinds of social deduction games are more of a social experience than a game. For the game portion you could just as easily hold a "black dot lottery" and then discuss who the room thinks holds the black dot--- all the trimmings are just chrome added onto that basic model.

People have an innate belief they can ferret out liars and enjoy the process of doing so. I consider these games to be little more than random chance at worst, and at best a test in persuasion--- a skill I care very little about.

The BEST version of a very great game.  The components are wonderful.  Some of the roles are unique and very interesting while others aren't as fun in my opinion.  But you can mix and match to suit your group, so it's not a problem.

This isn't a bad game, but it takes too long, has player elimination, and, even with roles, it is difficult figuring out who is a wolf. A lot of the games I have played have broken down to random guessing because there isn't any reliable information to go off of.

A thoroughly enjoyable game! One of the best party games out there.  The key is having a solid moderator and great village setup (read: balance).  A solid moderator should be able to teach (not just explain) the game to a point where each player knows exactly what they can and can't do in the game.  A great moderator can make even the most timid of people save themselves from a lynching.

The only downside is that you need a lot of people to play this game.  I'd say at least 8 + moderator.

Not a "bad" game there is just better games out there which touches the same itch. The major weaknesses of this game compared to newer games of this genre: 
1. You need a game master which cannot participate in the actual gameplay
2. You are out of the game when you die. 
3. You need alot of people to play the game properly.
I would say go with resistance/resistance: avalon instead which solves all the above issues.

I've given this a reasonably high rating, but its pretty context specific - this is the only game I've got that can be played with this many people, we've played with 14-22 and enjoyed it.  At the same time I wouldnt suggest it for just any group, some people just don't seem to like it.... But overall, if you ever hang out with 10+ people every now and then, this game is well worth having.  

I wonder a bit about the value of all the different roles, we didn't even get close to touching the surface of them all, so perhaps its a long term, play it a lot need variety kinda thing...

Update: I'm really starting to wane in my affection for werewolf. The problem is that the game isn't a very good game, its more of a social icebreaker.

Huge fan of this game but only when playing with close friends and with people who are over the top. It is my absolute favorite party game ever.

Also, I love mixing it up with tons of different roles, almost to the point where there are no vanilla villagers in the game.

Roleplaying game meets party game. Everyone pretends to be a villager, but a couple of the players are really werewolves. 

Each night, the werewolves "eat" another villager. 

Each day, the villagers decide to lynch someone for being a werewolf using only accusation, conversation, paranoia and their intuition.

A great way to destroy a friendship or 2 without owning a copy of Diplomacy.

Rating +1. I really must say that the game rocks with the right group of people. Yes, it's primitive, but it's also marvellous just to follow and reflect the group dynamics that can evolve. After a while you'll realize how to manipulate the other players, and how to NOT behave in order to maintain a chance of survival.

Player elimination = lame; broken mechanic; people eliminate you without rationale; too long for an elimination game & there is nothing interesting to watch once you are out.

Basically, it comes down to whoever can screams the loudest or who has favorable reliationships within the group.

I hate this game with a passion.

Few games that I own were I can play 8 or more people.  I bust this out and everyone has a good time and usually ask to play one or two more times before moving on to other games.  The only thing as I am normally the moderator, so wish I could get in on the game more.

Normally I start a short story about the village and then everyone does a fun little background story about themselves, so we get some role playing in....

I was worried that now that I have played newer traitor games such as The Resistance or BSG, I would not enjoy Werewolf at all, but I was wrong. The game is very interesting (with a large enough group at least) and while you can most definitely sense the familiarity with the aforementioned games, it warrants its own existence within the world of gaming. It feels much more open, social and narrative compared to The Resistance and this edition of all  things adds a lot to it with all the different character cards etc. I am not a big fan of a manual that gives you two dozens of variant without at least suggesting where to start or which one works best (in the opinion of the designer). With the right group, this can be a hoot !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A lot of unnecessary add-ons to a simple and fun game. I recommend buying this simply to get the cards you need to play the standard game. Most of extra cards you will likely never use.

Ultimate Werewolf is fun, even if there is the possibility that you are eliminated in the first round. The table talk trying to find out the identity of other players is really great.
Given that this game requires a high amount of players and a moderator I fear that this game only serves at rare ocasions.

It's just so inane.

An extremely impressive version of werewolf! Lots of tips, lots of roles, and lots of cards.  The only drawback is the cost, which compared to other versions is quite high.

This is the definitive edition of the best bluffing/party game of all time (IMO). We play werewolf for hours at every getaway, and it never gets old.

22-02-2015. Rated after about 10-15 games? Werewolf is a hidden role game, in which many people are peaceful and good citizins, but they  are under siege by werewolves. 

Each gameround consists of two phases, day and night phase. The night-phase consists of the werewolves secretly killing someone, when all villagers are sleeping (eyes closed). During the day, all villagers (and werewolves..) discuss who to kill because they 'behave' suspiciously or for whatever other reason. Killed players reveal their cards. When the villagers kill all werewolves, they win if the werewolves kill enough villagers, they win. 

Many version exist that add special roles to the game and complicate/extend the basic mechanisms.  I like the game fine, but I don't feel the need to play it often.

If you absolutely MUST buy a manufactured set of cards for Werewolf, this is probably the best choice. It allows great flexibility for the kind of game you want to make, and the rulebook itself is a must-read for any fans of this classic party game. The downside is that the cards don't look nearly as nice as the Werewolves of Miller's Hollow. Some of the illustrations are downright hideous.

I'm not a Werewolf fan, but mainly because I'm comparing it to the much better The Resistance. Still, for a really big group Werewolf offers something The Resistance can't - a really big group. Werewolf's strength is getting a whole class of school kids playing marathon sessions late into the night (ideally) on a camping trip. Unlike The Resistance though it's more of a guessing game, listening... guessing. The Resistance offers better bluff and deduction, no moderator needed, plus it has the advantage (in my opinion) of only having to close your eyes once at the beginning of the game instead of Werewolf's continual opening and closing. Player elimination is my main gripe. I'd only be interested in playing with a big group and in that case the wait between games can be a mite trying, unless you get a kick out of the spectator thing.

The fun is what you bring to the table and hamming it up and funny accusations are what makes the game. With a good group it's a good time, just not as good as you could be having with The Resistance. My nephews think it's the best game ever devised and I can see why. Not for me, but there'll definitely be a few in the crowd who love it. This is the best version I've come across - the roles make the bluffing and accusing even better, especially if the werewolves know them all like the back of their hands.

RATING: 7
As with [b]Mafia[/b], [b]Wink Murder[/b], or (of course) [b]Werewolf[/b], the joy of this party game of hidden identities and secretive killings is dependent upon the role you play and when you are eliminated - if your role has no real abilities or if you are eliminated quickly in the early rounds, the game unfortunately turns into a waiting game. 

[b]Ultimate Werewolf[/b] tries to address these issues by creating new roles and adding some interesting variations on game mechanics - and to a degree they were successful - but the mere fact that player elimination is maintained still keeps it back from being the go-to party game.

[b]Edit (12/2016):[/b] Games such as [b]Resistance[/b], [b]Skyfall[/b], and [b]Deception[/b] have all made this game obsolete.

Very light rules, but very, very funny since it is so full of social interaction.

Played about 6 or 7 games of Ultimate Werewolf on my birthday, October 31. First few games were played with 6 people but as people came in and left, we managed to get an 8 player game going. Really not a game for any less than 8 people, in my opinion. Too fast, players feel cheated, but somehow everyone still has something to talk about in the post game analysis. 

Huge replayability.

I finally played my first game of Werewolf!  These ratings and comments are based on a single play where I moderated a game with around a dozen players.  And the verdict: fun!!  I've never played Werewolf or Mafia or any similar game before, but I found this to be a very light, fast-paced, laugh-inducing game for a large group of people.  Of course, the major downside is the fact that you do need at least a dozen people to get the most out of this game, but this is balanced by the major upside, which is that there are very few games you can play with this many people!  This "ultimate" edition comes with a ton of cards and characters, as well as a bunch of different scenario suggestions.  The artwork is quite cheesy, and perhaps that's the point, but I would have liked to see a style that was a little more... well... "fun", I guess.  And while there are more character roles than I'm sure I'll ever use, I REALLY wish they had included a brief description of the role on each card.  This is a game which unfortunately won't be played very often due to the number of people required, but I'll try to take advantage of large family gatherings to break it out!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

There are three problems with this game.  #1) It's hard to get people together for it because it requires them to be in the right mood.  #2) Usually better with a lot of people, and it's hard to get them all together.  #3) "I think we should kill X because I heard his clothes move!"  I don't know how to stop this.  Three games in a row the villagers killed the werewolf off the bat because they heard some faint shuffling of clothes.  *sigh*

I really like the idea of all the different cards and powers, but it's just hard to get people into it.  Still, I like the whole mix-and-match-your-own-character combo aspect a lot.

Update: Last time we played, we had everyone close their ears at night.  You can still hear the moderator talking, but you just can't hear shuffling noises.  It made the game 100x times better, and the werewolves actually WON!

Great party game especially if you have a good moderator. It also helps when everyone is into the game and making up character names and back sorry.

Version came with dents and box damage. Returned and at the same time decided to not order a replacement.

Reason is I already have the pocket-version + movie monsters so I would only order it for the night terrors expansion. Could be cool but I can use that money for other games as well. Won't be leading a class/scouting club in the near future anyway, so the sets I have will do for any big group showing up for game nights :D

Great edition of the classic game. Admittedly, some roles just seem virtually unusable, but overall this is a great edition.

RATING: 5.9
A lot more fun than I expected; I've learned not to do too well; being the seer, finding one werewolf on turn one, not saying anything and then finding the other on turn 2 gets you killed because no-one believes the odds of finding both in one night.

Update: It's much, much better with 6 or so players than 10+. I'd never play it with that many again.

With 6 players, it's probably close to a 7, but with more it's nearer a 3.

Rating down from 7 to 5.9.

This is the BEST version of Werewolf to buy right now.  It's a little pricey, but the art is magnificent, the cards are very practical, and very good quality, the rulebook is top notch. And it comes with any role you could possibly think of, and a couple of blanks as well.

This has replaced me buying lupus in tabula decks and writing on all the cards for different roles.

I don't rate this game, because it's no different than the main werewolf entry and should be a version of that, not a separate entry.  So I record my plays and rating under that game.  But this is the one that I use.

I've played this game every Thursday night for the last 3 months. We don't just play it once, we usually play for 4-5 hours (so 5ish games at a time). I can't begin to explain how awesome this game is. I am up for it at any time, day or night. The player interactions are incredibly fun: no one can be trusted and you have only your wits to rely on. The more you play it with the same people, the more fun it becomes, but it's still incredibly fun with strangers! I highly recommend this for any group of gamers with 10+ people.

Very poor game compared to The Resistance: Avalon. You have to make decisions based on no information and people get eliminated at random. If you have enough people for a game of Werewolf, just break into smaller games of Avalon.

I like all hidden role games, and Werewolf is no exception.

However, I will rarely choose to play this game over The Resistance. Two big faults make this less than the ideal hidden role game: player elimination, and total information blackout in the first few rounds.

I will say, however, that the tremendous amount of optional characters that are available in this Ultimate Werewolf edition give the game a very satisfying amount of variety that the Resistance does not have(which is why I prefer TR: Avalon, by the way).

After a fair few more plays including a good one over the Christmas break my group has warmed to this game. My only problem with the game is that it requires a moderator and normally the fun kind of hinges on that person to keep the game going at a good rate as wells as be enthusiastic, I'm going to investigate one night ultimate werewolf to fix this.

*Edit - Now I own ultimate werewolf this game is pretty much obsolete apart from the time once a year we manage to play with a large number of players.

with a good/great moderator, this is one of if not the best social games. With a poor moderator this can be one of the worst. 

While Ultimate One Night Werewolf is hot at this time (2014/2015), it still pales in comparison to the original game. Elimination adds so much of the dramatic tension that makes the game so good. Now I think this game gets way out of hand once it starts to approach the 30 person mark.

Werewolf can be interesting with the right group and without too many different roles/variants being used.  If you have enough people, like 8-10 people or so, then it's worth trying out, although usually I'd rather split into smaller groups and play something a bit heavier.

Can be really fun with the right group. Can be really dull with the wrong group. Can be fun to try to discover the badies, and can be fun to try to be the evil characters. Can be dull to be getting killed in the first opportunity. This edition adds a whole lot of new possibilities for a tired game, which is great.

Not in love with the game, but I would play it.

Great production with a large variety of roles to spice up. Classic party game must have in any collection. Although one might argue that the modern social deduction games have surpassed werewolf in terms of mechanism. The same experience in an overall tighter and better game.

In a dinner party atmosphere, where the game is played casually, I can see how the game would have some appeal, like a small scale murder mystery party. However, when played competitively, the game is weak. Very little information is gained in a normal game, making it little more that a glorified guessing game. Also, the element of people being eliminated and having to sit out the rest of the game is a major flaw.

1st update (Oct 2013)[8]: I've been playing the original mafia/werewolf a lot, and I used to rate it a 10. But after discovering The Resistance, I can no longer rate it higher than an 8. I do appreciate it for all the variety it brings, and it can be a lot of fun ... but not for the ones who get lynched the first day.

The classic deduction party game of Werewolf in ultimate form. Put the cards in closable business card wallets and put on thematic music for day/voting/night gives a story for players that they will never forget. 

This game needs a good moderator who can create the perfect village and story but when in doubt have people claim to be certain stereotypes/roles/actors/or characters - the village of movie villains is a good choice. For example in one of my villain villages, Darth Vader lynched Scar from the Lion King in the first round, HAL 9000 was the Seer, and the lone werewolf who won was a raptor from Jurassic Park (all that player did was roar and point at other players).

Best social game ever. This is the father of all the new bluffing games out there: Resistance, Coup, One Night Ultimate Werewolf...

I gotta say, Ultimate Werewolf is still the best one in the gender. And I'll tell you why... Most bluffing games today are incredibly based on lack of information, so usually the best liar wins. This is kind of fun in the first games but eventually you will start to want the game to reward you for thinking and putting together a social puzzle. And that's something Ultimate Werewolf does!

Every day a new clue is given to the villagers, every day they will gather around and elaborate theories of who might be a werewolf. A history is built throughout the game, unlike the other bluffing games.

Werewolf is the ultimate party game and this is the definitive version of it. If you get a great moderator and the right group of people (ideally between 7-12) then you are in for a fun and spooky exercise in paranoia. A must have game, especially during October.

Very fun hidden role social deduction game. If you like telling stories and lying to people's faces, this is a great game. I don't like that it requires a moderator and so many people to play (definitely a party game) but the One Night variant fixes that. You can get the app for free for the One Night variant, and use the same cards as is in the normal Werewolf game.

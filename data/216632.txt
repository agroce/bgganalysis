This is a great game, though the rules need some clarification - and check the errata before playing.

Had this demonstrated wildly incorrectly at UKGE - please check the rules before playing if you had the same experience. The "real" game is both better and simpler!

I greatly dislike trick taking games, but tournament at camelot has added a take that factor to it that even though it is trick taking it I would play this again. I gave it a 6 cause not only did I enjoy myself playing it, I can definitely see myself playing again. Maybe even owning a copy and I really don't like trick taking games.

I got to play this with one of the designers, and had a great time.  I enjoyed the game so much, I knew I had to add it to my collection.  They art on the large size cards is cool.  Plenty of variety with the different character/special power cards and the godsend cards allow trailing players to catch up.  Most games should end up close.
It's a trick taking game where you don't want to take the tricks. All the cards deal damage and the player with the most health when one players dies is the winner.

For me this game amounted to a whole lot of bells and whistles surrounding a pretty mediocre trick-taking game.  The player powers are cool and the godsend cards do cool things.  But at the end of the day, the card play decisions pretty much make themselves.  When there are a whole lot of godsend cards in play the game can bog down and get convoluted.  I did enjoy the tarot sized cards and the art style.

I love trick taking games and this is no exception. I'm a huge fan of the variable player powers and I really like that it's mostly about not taking the tricks. Really fun and I can't wait to play this again.

My family and I really enjoy playing this game.  We often have trouble finding games that are enjoyable for the whole family, because what appeals to an 8 year old or 12 year old, doesn't necessarily appeal to my wife and I. Luckily, my 8 year old picked it up immediately, and the whole family was able to enjoy the game play and the different characters.  The Godsend cards are a nice idea to help the people that start out behind in points get caught up, or at least enjoy being behind.  We look forward to playing many more games together.

The trick taking part is fine. The stacking godsend card effects and player powers make a simple game complicate quickly. The health tying to companion powers is neat, but overall it seems like it's too much for what it is. I also have no idea who this game is for? It's too light and too complicated in a way that make it a less than ideal game for most.

Tournament at Camelot is a rich re-imagining of a simple trick taking game. In the last game I participated in, I played as Tristan with the ability (once per round) to hide a card under my character with the ability to change out my initially played card in an effort to avoid taking the trick. I appreciate the how the game keeps all players highly engaged with more injured players picking up abilities to stay in the fight. Really enjoy the artwork and the history detailed on the back of the character cards. Next time, Jill gets the poisoned apple without question.

RATING: 3
Tournament at Camelot is a trick taking game, however there is no trump suit and no set amount of tricks to take goals. To add to the game, Camelot has special abilities and awarded "godsend" cards for each player that affect the trick in various ways. With so many special powers, unfortunately, the game feels a bit too chaotic. Trick taking games have luck built in with the hand players' receive, and adding additional chaos on top of that leads to  an individual's action feeling inconsequential. A good trick taker will allow players enough agency to attempt to control the flow of the round by the cards they are dealt. Camelot doesn't do this. It is below average for trick takers, in this regard.

Solid trick taking game with very nice cards and reasonably crafted handicapping system. There is unfortunately an underlying systematic problem, namely the cards you are dealt decide too much how you are going to do within a round. It is next to impossible to play well with small cards and with a hand of varied suits and high numbers you can go on cruise control. There is also very seldom any reason not to play your largest number of any given suit.

One of the best trick taking games I’ve played, and it actually is a good trick taking game for people that don’t normally like trick taking. The game is played over multiple rounds and in each round you take damage based on how many cards (tricks) you take, once a player goes below zero health the game ends and the player with the highest remaining health wins. The best part of this game are the player powers and there are special temporary player powers that are given to the lowest health player(s) each round.

Base mechanics are easy to learn in 5-10 minutes. Character rules and powers allow for surprising tactical complexity and clever turnarounds. Balancing mechanism grants cool powers to battered players, making this a good game for kid/adult and experienced/newbie groups. Artwork is a delightful change from standard fantasy. Special card rules need a bit of clarification so check out the errata. looking forward to playing this again!

Really dig the graphic design for this, the choosing of tarot sized cards while remaining fairly compact overall, and that it can play 2-6. The use of the medieval art is just fantastic.
Interesting game. Lots of variety with the different player powers and God cards. Plenty of friendly cutthroat fun.

Chaotic at six, but super fun and almost too short at that player count as someone can wrack up damage very fast before companions really come into play.  EDIT: This game continues to go over like gangbusters.  Tried it with five, including two who've never played a trick taking game.  It's still chaotic and has wild damage swings (At least twice someone took over 200 damage) but people were just losing it with laughter.  Bumped  my rating up to reflect this.

Solid trick-taking game. Maybe a little over-hyped, but a lot of fun nonetheless. I do dig the Camelot theme, and it is pretty well-represented here. I'm not a fan of the art style and the religious undertones, but I suppose it's appropriate for the subject matter. I think the biggest thing holding me back from considering this to be in my top trick-taking games is how you don't ever have perfect information on all the cards in the game. There will always be leftover cards in the deck, so you can't really account for those. I prefer trick-taking games where all the cards are dealt out, so this is a ding against the game for me. Otherwise the game play is really good. The player powers seem fairly balanced, the flow is good, and it doesn't go on that long, which holds back a lot of trick-taking games from greatness.

I have played a ton of Spades and Dominoes in my life, and have just kind of moved on from generic abstract games, usually; especially when they are similar to those two games. It had some cool concepts, and for those who like trick taking, they will probably find this one enjoyable. I had a decent time, but would not want to really play this one, if I could get another game to the table.

Played with 4 players and this is not a bad trick taking game. The cards offer different powers that play differently with other powers and so you are always having to look and see what powers everyone else has and even there new relic power. For me there is just way to much going on for a trick taking game.

My favorite Trick Taker.   The Holy Knights rule, King Arthur drools.  So much of the game is making temp alliances and knowing when to take a hit.   If you play it only a few times you will think it is very random, but in time you can deal with all but the worst of hands.  Table talk (smack), adds a lot.

RATING: 9
I absolutely love this game. It's clear that a lot of care went into the balance of obtaining Godsend cards, preventing players from ever feeling like there's nothing they can do to catch up or win. With so many Godsend combinations in the game, it's almost impossible to predict the outcome. 

I can't wait to play this game again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I see a lot of "I don't even like trick-taking games, but..." comments here, so I'll just say that I love trick-taking games.

First play impression: the game is good and maybe even great. I need more plays to tell.

The trick-taking part is really straightforward. You have to follow suit or play one of the sorcerer wild cards if possible, if you can't then you have to play an Alchemy card (Alchemy acts as a kind of wild suit). Lowest card takes the trick, and this is a game where you don't want to take tricks.

What mixes things up are the various abilities that are going on. Each player starts with an ability in play, you activate a second ability once your health drops low enough, and players get temporary Godsend cards after each round based on who is furthest behind. Godsend cards could be one-time use, or they could have an ongoing effect for the whole next round. There is quite a range of abilities. Maybe you can always play last during a trick, add +3 to your card if it is of a certain suit, or draw more cards at the start of a round so you have more options.

I generally like trick-taking games where you deal out the whole deck but in this one each player gets a flat 12 cards. It doesn't feel like much of an issue in this game because there is quite a bit of chaos already. However, it does seem like this game is meant for four or more players, because in a three player game you wouldn't even see half the deck, and of course trick-taking games don't work with two players (despite what a lot of modern trick-taking games try to claim).

So far I only have a couple of issues. The cards being tarot size detracts from the game. The deck consists of 80 cards, and you just can't shuffle that large of a tarot-sized deck very easily. It's also a little less comfortable to hold your hand of 12 cards with them being so large. If they ever make a poker-size or even a bridge-size version then I will definitely pick it up.

My other issue is that a lot of timing issues come up that aren't covered very well in the rules. Luckily there is an official FAQ on the forums and it will hopefully cover all of the issues eventually.

Overall the game seems really promising. Similar to the game Nyet, they just took a really basic trick-taking system and blew it up with extra stuff, in this case it's all sorts of chaos and fun abilities.

Update: Still liking the game a lot, but I'm considering removing a couple of cards. One is Fanfare, which makes someone have to lead every trick of the round. Not only is this a huge penalty (the person will probably take fatal or near fatal damage on that round) but it just isn't fun for that player.

Another is the protagonist who can cancel a whole round of damage. If that person is in the lead after a round or two, you basically have to focus all damage and negative cards onto that person for a round to make them use their ability, nearly negating a whole round of the game. This also just isn't fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A trick-taking game with unique player power. The catch up mechanic gives you a temporary power to play during a round. A good end of the night game that runs for 45 mins.

This was surprisingly fun and a keeper for small card games!

It's chaotic and sometimes there's a lot to keep track - which can turn people off. I love the action. It's probably best to enjoy all the take-that and the swinging nature of the game. Special cards for players with the least points allow for catching up and great excitement to the end.

There is a very heavy dose of randomness and imbalance to this game, that should be said up front.  This is the Cosmic Encounter of Trick-Taking games.   Asymmetrical starting abilities and random powers granting huge point swings and potentially severely handicapping other players.  This is going to make a large amount of board gamers run screaming right off the bat, and is also why I'm sad I'll probably hardly ever get to play this because I find it a good amount of fun.  Trick-taking games are all about getting bad deals and trying to turn them to your advantage, this just adds more crazy and fun to the mix.

I will preface this by saying I do not like trick taking games. That being said, If someone was to bring this to the table I would probably play it. It has some great twist on the tradition trick taking game. Just enough "take that" that it doesn't become frustrating, and more strategy then I am accustomed to from a trick taking game.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not convinced we played everything right in my first play with 3, but there is a lot of potential here for people that enjoy trick taking games.  Of course, this is a trick avoidance game which turns some of your plans on their head from the beginning but the special power cards floating around give you a lot of unusual things to think about for this kind of game too.  Definitely something I want to play again to form a more solid opinion.

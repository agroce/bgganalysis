Finally got this to the table after years of ownership.  And it is a keeper!  Great card game that manages to get the feel of a series of battles.  The powers make the game, adding a lot of depth for a simple ruleset.

131224 Confrontational slow auction type of game.  I quite like it.   I think I like "live" auctions and this mechanic approximates it nicely (as in Condotierre and High Society, both favorites of mine).  Wife finds it a bit too confrontational (as is her beef with Schottentotten and Aton).

Fun game.  Players manage clans, have battles, and take advantage of the various clans special abilities.

RATING: 6
My first player was confusing, but the second play was quite nice. I like the simplicity of only a few types of cards (each clan has one ability). Having abilities that only act when the value is *lower* is a great way to make low and high cards (which count to strength) equally attractive and is smart. It is a bit confrontational at times and the card abilities are not entirely clear to a new player. The new version has what I consider very beautiful illustrations. Over all, a rather dry affair with just enough confusion to make it off-putting. Might go on the trade pile.

A zman production card game about a bunch of Scottish clans fighting over which clan will be in charge. Cute. The art is pretty terrible but if you can get past that the game is alright.

What can I say? I truly think this game is outstanding. Up to now I only played 2 player games but I am sure that the 4 player game will be a hit among my "Take That" addicted friends.

As someone wrote somewhere else, as soon as the game "clicks" the fun begins and you can adjust the level of aggressiveness you want to apply.

I am surprised how much I came to like LOS and is one of my 3 favourite games.

I am not a fan of card games. There are card games that I like better than Lords of Scotland for reasons that have nothing to do with the "card gaminess" of them, like psychological mind games, theme, tension level, etc. But in terms of "pure" card games (which Lords of Scotland most definitely is), this is the best card game I have ever played! It is better than Dominion, and far, FAR better than Havoc!:The Hundred Years War upon which it is partly based. It is an excellent tactical game, but what is surprising is that it is also a fabulous strategy game, since the cards you play (or don't play) in one round will have an effect on subsequent rounds. There is an awful lot going on in this one.
It's just a pity that Clan MacLeod isn't one of the suits...

This is a great card game with some really cool ideas!  If you see it for $10 or less, buy it! EDIT: I just moved this up from 8 to 10! I spent a weekend playing it numerous times and now realize that there is a lot more to the game than I originally realized. This is a very tactical game which relies little on luck (of course, sometimes you hope to take certain cards, but you can almost always figure out something to do with the cards in your hands).  I now *highly* recommend this card game.  It has quite possibly surpassed Wizard as my favorite card game!

Hard to explain, mostly because of confusion; individual cards are called "clans" but each has a clan listed on it and they are the same on all cards of the same suit, but that clan is the clan's bloodline instead. Just a little effort in the rules could've cleared this up and made it all much easier to understand.

RATING: 7.7
Fun game where you're trying to gain the support of valued cards by skirmishing with hands of cards (or swapping for recruits in the center of the play area). There are also powers to put together combos or mimic other players cards, and you score extra if you're remaining army has clans of the same bloodline. The new artwork is great, quite a step above the original that I've seen.

RATING: 8
An area majority game with some light take-that elements with cards on the table. Oddly enough, I was reminded of the second round of For Sale; the trick is to look at the 'supporters' (i.e. point cards) on round now at determine when to go all out, gather cards for the next round and trying to block anybody close to winning. It's possible that it could more thinky if you keep close tabs on the cards won (and thus, cards left out of the deck).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very strong card game with a lot of take-that elements.

The conceit of the game is that the players are trying to rally support of the different Scottish clans.  Each Clan is essentially a suit with a special power (powers will let you draw more cards or steal things from other players....stuff like that), and each suit has values of 1 to 11.  Higher value cards will give you more strength in each round of play, but lower value cards will give you a better chance to use the clans special ability.

The other twist is that in each round you have a limited amount of actions, where you can either play a card in order to better your chances of scoring, or take a card to build your hand up.  This creates some nice tension as you will often need to gather strength for future rounds but don't want to totally miss an opportunity to score points in the current one.

Very much worth your time if you like trick-taking type card games with lots of good interaction.

Pro's:

1) I really enjoy the combination of hand management along with the open information that is available to everyone. I find it has an excellent combination of these elements that really put the game above many other card games I have played of this type.
2) Art is simple and evocative. The cards feel very satisfying to shuffle and hold with the linen finish giving everything a great aesthetic.

Con's:

1) Some powers seem inherently less useful than others. Furthermore some are just harder to grasp therefore seeing less play.
2) I have actually seen this game cause AP in some players. Also those same players end up feeling frustrated as they cannot see the combinations they need to get the most value out of their cards.

As with all card games there's randomness in the luck of the draw but there's a number of other elements here which make this an attractive filler - the rounds  play quickly and the interaction of the powers and the need to replenish your hand as well as score points gives you interesting choices to make.  Try not to let the artwork put you off.

! Now this is a fantastic card game! Your goal is to score 40 point, and you do that by playing several rounds of play, each having exactly 5 turns in which you can either draw a card or play a card with a number ranging from 1-12. Once all 5 rounds are over, the highest score gets to pick one of the face-up scoring cards (which also consists of cards ranging from 1-12 as they’re the same cards). So if my strength is 40, yours is 28 and the last player has a strength of 15, I get to pick one of the cards first. They’re all visible before the round start, so if they’re for instance 12-5-1, you better win that round and claim those 12 points (unless the other players can see that you’re going to win and perhaps decide to swap that 12 with a lower card)! Easy rules and easy to play as you only do one of two things, but it’s a game that is hard to master!

So you might think the higher cards are better, and yes they are if you’re only thinking about the highest score. But there are both advantages and disadvantages to the high and low cards; high cards give you a bigger chance of winning the skirmish and thereby claiming the highest card, but the low cards can be activated ofter for their special abilities and can be used to block the other players in playing their special powers, as only lower cards of the same type which have already been played can have their abilities activated! This is truly genius. 

It is a very different game with 2, 3 and 4 players (I haven’t tried it with 5 yet, but I suspect that downtime is going to be an issue and that the game might last for an hour). Especially the rules change from 2-3 and 4 players is a huge change which influences your strategy, because you can activate the power for each clan when playing with 4-5 compared to 2-3, and we have found that the rules for 4-5 players actually work better with 3 too (although 4 is, imo, the best number).

What I like is that each hand is important, and you need to intimidate the other players – and even if you don’t have good cards, you can always play one face down and act as if you have great cards… It’s a big advantage going last in the round as you can play the last card without the other players being able to do anything about it, and it’s especially sneaky if you play the green ”claim two supporters” clan card as your last action and nobody can react; if you’re possessing the biggest strength, you just screwed your opponents, especially the one with the lowest strength as he then won’t get any point cards at all! But be aware that playing a green clan card early on will probably get you targeted; the clan will probably be assassinated or swapped, at least if you’re in the lead. And other players can play green cards preemptively. 

The game ends when a player has 40 points, and that might be slightly too many in some games when the scoring cards are of low value. But it does make sense when the cards go to 12 and due to the green cards which lets you claim two supporters instead of just one – again, be aware of the last player playing such a clan card!

All of the special abilities are awesome! None are bad, it just depends on the situation. Most of them are activated immediately upon playing them (well, at least if the number is lower than any of the other playedcards of that clan – if I play a 10, and there is already a 9 on the table of that clan, the power doesn’t activate, but if I play a 6, it does). Some of the more nasty cards include discarding clans (including your own which might be a good idea sometimes) or to swap the clan you play with another player’s clan, which also might be a great idea if it interrupts their bloodlines; because if you only play cards of a single clan, the score of the mare doubled! Another card lets you exchange it with one of the supporter cards (the cards you claim in strength order after 5 turns and which counts as points) – so if you can see that you’re losing, you might as well exchange your low card with that neat 12 in the supporter row – and watch how your opponents become very … let’s call it dissatisfied!

Maybe you think that my rating doesn’t do the game justice, at least according to my praise, but a 8 is one of the best ratings I’ve ever given to a pure card game! It’s honestly one of the better card games I’ve playing in a long, long time. It is filled with strategy and tactics in a tiny box (I know that Z-Man is reprinting it in a bigger box; I hate oversized boxes, but at least the game will be widely available again so you can all enjoy the cleverness of this card game).

Chaotic but oddly "wargamey" card game. You are either taking cards from the face up/face down selection, playing cards face up or face down to build your army. The better army gets the choice of prize cards. Special abilities abound. A good two player card game. Likely plays well with three. I think the chaos might get a bit kooky with more.

This game has a great balance of luck and strategy. Even the lowliest card has a clan 'power' that can turn the tide of a round, and no matter how poorly you play or draw, you almost always score points at the end of a round. Very similar play to 'Condottiere' but with a better theme and no board. Both games have a treasured position in my collection.

Turns are fast since you can either take a card or play a card face up or down. The auto balance of the abilities versus the card values is simplistic but it works. The thing that doesn't work well is the random card draw in this game. There is more luck than strategy when it comes to playing your hand effectively when the others on the table have the same random draw to work with.

Art is a bit drab and the theme is dry. Game play can get a bit repetitive.

RATING: 4
A neat little card game played over several rounds. Players alternate turns either gathering new cards or playing them face up or down. The neat aspect is for a card to be placed face up and use an ability, it must be equal or lower than all other cards in play. With this in mind, players can block others from using abilities when they want. After 5 turns, the total sum of played cards wins the round and dibs at one of two random victory cards for the round. Play continues until 40 victory points are reached. It's an interesting, yet confusing game to learn. Seems like it would be very challenging when played with experienced players.

Lords of Scotland is a number and suits game. That said, it breaks a lot of the traditional tropes of a number and suits game. There is a lot of very direct "take that" sort of interactions. In addition, there are special abilities associated with each suit. In fact, it has a number of other things that make it feel unique as well. For example, you can play cards face-up to try and make use of a cards special abilities or face-down so your opponent(s) have less of an idea of how well you're doing. The way you trigger abilities is even pretty interesting: if you play a suit with a 'strength' number equal to or lower than any card of that suit among all tableaus and you can trigger the special ability (for higher player counts... with lower number of players, it must be lower than or equal to all other cards) . Each of the rounds have a random number of VP's available to the people with the most 'strength,' but people can manipulate these VP values. So, there are incentives to play low cards or high cards. If any of this sounds interesting to you, I think it's worth trying. There is also no better time since the new edition looks so much nicer than the one that was previously available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solidly fun game, with lots of "moving pieces" and a simplicity that belies the underlying strategy and pace of the game. Still, it's very tactical and you have to really pay attention to get the outcome you want. However, sometimes you get hosed, but through no fault of the game or it's design. This is all true ONLY for a 2-3 player game. 

4 and 5 player games are a hot mess!

A skirmish against your rivals. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king? A fun game to play with 2-4 players takes about 30 minutes. Good game to play while waiting on other games to finish at game nights.

RATING: 7
This game is a steal for $7.  Like [thing=19363][/thing], players build their hand and have the option of drawing or playing cards during their turn.  High cards are essential for collecting victory point cards while low cards are more useful for activating the special abilities found on each one.  About ½ through the first game, it became apparent that there were some clever ways the cards interact with each other allowing players to score big points (one has to be careful not to jump too far ahead early on or they will become the target of negative cards).   The interaction is high but the screwage abilities never crossed the annoying line for me.

With 2P: I was impressed at the cleverness of the game in how you play cards face up to activate powers or facedown to hide your troops. That the card must be the lowest on the table in order for its power to activate was a nice touch as well. There's obviously a high level of interaction (read: screwage) but once I accepted that, I enjoyed trying to ride the waves better than my opponent without getting tumbled over myself. Definitely a smart game and I'd like to explore it more, however, I'm not sure what the ideal player count for this game is. It sure felt like a 2P game to me and that introducing more players would amp up the chaos to an unacceptable level. If that's the case, I'll be a little disappointed as I bought it as a new multiplayer filler card game (though it looks like PAX has that sewed up anyway).

With 4P: It felt too chaotic with 4 and didn't click with us. We also had some problems with rules ambiguities which is the death knell for a game that people are lukewarm about. 

In the end, I put the rating at a 5. I think the game works best as a 2P game but there are other 2P games I'd rather play. For 3 or more, I'd definitely choose PAX over this one.

This is a good game if you like to think, but you'll usually never be faced with a move you know for certain is the optimum move, so you'll have to wind up trusting your gut a lot.  There are several clans, and you can play cards from any clan.  Each clan has its own unique power, but you can only use that power when you play the card, if the card you play has the lowest numerical value (1-12) of any cards of that clan already in play.  However, you win with the highest numerical value.  So you have to balance wanting to play big numbers, without being able to use powers, and playing small numbers to use powers (and possibly block other players from using powers on you).  Its got good art, too.  Not a hard game to learn, but a challenge to master.

Decent amount of strategy available in this simple card game. Good with 2, but haven't played with more. Playing all the same suit in a round is very powerful. 

Fluff of the theme complicates what would otherwise be simple instructions.

Bloodline = Suit
Skirmish = cards in play this round

Lords of Scotland is a bit chaotic but short and fun with enough control to make some level of skill still useful.  It has something I like in games: the possibility of the "big play" that either shoots you ahead or catches you up.  A really good little card game.

Big play in a small, inexpensive package.

Playing this always creates the desire in me to don a kilt, play the pipes, pour out a few too many glasses of single malt Scotch, curse in Celtic, and toss my opponent out me window like a caber. Great back & forth gameplay and nice art on the clan cards. Highland heaven

RATING: 8.5
An excellent card game that is simple enough to teach but with enough meaty decisions every turn. You can pull off some very neat card manipulations to make the game go your way and there is some bluffing in play.

 Since there is a lot of player interaction, I would only recommend it for 2 players. I've played with 4 and it's too chaotic and takes too long to play.

RATING: 8
The first edition is pretty ugly and the rulebook is surprisingly confusing considering its small size but the second edition makes up for all that, sorts out the terminology and lets the game shine as a nice little card filler, playing low cards for their effects and high cards for winning tricks. Perfect for three players with a small table.

RATING: 7
This is a surprisingly clever game—with gorgeous artwork to boot! It's often the case you'll build up your hand for a few turns, but this often balanced by needing to defend against other players. Equally balanced is the tension between playing cards face-up to get their powers and keeping them hidden to surprise your enemies (especially with a well-played same-Clan bonus). I wonder if the same-Clan bonus might be a touch overpowered, but needing to use the Clan powers helps mitigate it somewhat. Well worth playing.

RATING: 6.5
Good, mechanically sound high-stakes cardgame. Lots of drama, bluffing, all-or-nothing decisions. Recommended.

Update: I like it, but it's a little long for what it is. Lots of ganging up on the leader, which invariably leads to close games - too close, perhaps.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (April 2012)

A good light game, easy to teach and with a healthy dose of luck but it offers some interesting decisions and I suspect the game is more deep that I initially thought. There are many useful powers in the game but what I really like is the limitation the lowest number played imposes upon them; it allows for a more tactical game and reduces a little the luck factor. You have to plan very carefully which battles you will fight to win and which battles you will conserve your strength (a la Condottiere).

On the bad side the artwork could have been better but it doesn’t bother me that much.

Bottom line I like the game, it is fun, portable, it has short play time and it is easy to teach, I believe I will be playing this a good number of times in the coming days and perhaps the rating will go up.

Current Rating: 7.5

Lords of Scotland contains some interesting ideas and card interactions, but  it's a bit clunky and feels like it's missing something.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Simple card game in which you either pick up ("recruit") or put down ("muster") cards over five rounds, with the most mustered getting first choice of the cards-per-player you draw for points. 40 wins the game. But each has powers and there are limits to when you can play them as well. A good starter game that's fairly inexpensive.

PLUS: inexpensive, quick to learn, plays quickly, luck and strategy are balanced
MINUS: unclear rules about when to double

I haven't played any of the games this one purportedly borrows from. The terminology in the rules took a little getting used to and we played wrong initially as a result. However, we've enjoyed all of our games. Very interactive with lots of "take that" card play. No card played is safe and even the points you are playing for can change dramatically each hand (or "skirmish"). Even still, there is enough strategy and choice to save the game from feeling like a waste of time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Luck of the draw is massive here as well as take-that-bash-the-leader. Really see no reason to play this again.

Recently learned I was taught this incorrectly. Only the weaker cards of each currently played cards take effect when played. Hmm. That could help to curb the randomness and reign in folks who just luck out with bigger numbers. Raised rating to 3 for potential.

played with 2.  solid game, may go up with more players.   Not a lot of theme connected to the gameplay, but there is a semi-unique feel to the gameplay that I like.  If it works better with more than 2, this is a keeper.

This plays fast and there is quite a good amount of decision packed in this card game. You play skirmishes and try to collect the most valuable clans on your side in the land of beautiful Scotland. You do feel the fight as you play with your opponent(s) and there is tension in the game. Easy set of rules with some tricks. You are trying to collect the highest rank of cards but all the cards have abilities and you can activate these abilities only if your card is the lowest face up cards on the table. It means that those cards get activated that tend to be on the lower end. So which one do you chose? Is it worth activating the ability on a lower rank or you just try to collect the high ability cards?
Huge replayability as the cards you draw is always different and you have to adjust your strategy.

I loved playing the game of War as a kid, even if by myself.  Lords of Scotland is like War 2.0, it adds more complexity which makes it more of a gamers game.  I think this is just a fantastic card game and the art will transport you to Scotland.  Big card game in a little box.

RATING: 9
This is a very good Card Game. Easy to learn, but you can really develop a good strategy by saving and using the skill ability of the cards to help lock the other player out of winning the skirmishes. While there is a small bit of randomness in the card distribution, you can quickly turn that around and use skill to adapt to the cards you are dealt, or have as options to collect. I have played this a number of times and would say 4-5 people is the best combo, but any combo works just fine. One of my favorite gateway card games to get people away from hold em and into something more unique. Highly recommend, High re-play-ability.

RATING: 5.5
A good filler with some devious interplay between the cards, but only works with 2 or 3, actually best with two - the less chaos the better. If you absolutely insist on playing it with 4 or 5, I'd strongly suggest using the 2/3 player rules instead of the normal 4/5 player rules, to have at least some control over the random chaos. The rules could be laid out a lot better. Probably the worst artwork I've seen in a game.

For my tastes, Three-Dragon Ante does about the same thing a lot better, so Lords of Scotland hasn't seen too much play. It's a lot better with two than TDA though.

Breezy and actually not bad! There are better-balanced card games, but Lords of Scotland is simple, easy, attractive, and often quite funny.

An excellent, tactical card game which has elements of bluffing, attacking, and strategic planning.  Fun and portable, very good gameplay with anywhere from two through five players.

This is an awesome little game -- and it packs more strategy into a filler game than I'm used to. The cards are well-designed, and although I initially found them a bit garish and the art kind of ugly, the colors and artwork have grown on me.

It matches its theme surprisingly well: spend more time fighting skirmishes, and you have less time to recruit; recruit often, while giving up a strategically unimportant skirmish, and you have a more flexible fighting force available.

The mechanics are mostly familiar, but that's not a bad thing -- it makes the game play quickly after just a single play. There's little room for analysis paralysis in such short turns, and the balance of strategy and tactics hits a real sweet spot for me. I also love the turn counter mechanic of flipping a new clan each turn. 

LoS is on track to become one of my favorite filler games -- it's really good.

If you enjoy leisurely card games that involve hand management (like [i]Lost Cities[/i], for example) you will be a fan of [i]Lords of Scotland[/i].  The game kind of reminds me of [i]Taj Mahal[/i] with a much higher luck factor.  At times you will purposely tank a round to get cards that will set you up for a win in a future round.  The way the rules coax you into melding low cards by offering bonus powers is intriguing.

Mid-2012 - Played two games solitaire. I was very disappointed. The amateurish artwork was about 25% of that. The poor game play was 75%. So much so I'm extremely hesitant to foist this on my game group. I won't rate it until I do play it with others, but my gut feeling is its a "3" or a "4".

RATING: 6.5
The deck is divided into about ten "clans" (suits), each of which has a special power. Lords of Scotland is played as a series of "skirmishes": basically, these are tricks played over five rounds. Each round the players can either add another card to their hand, or play a card to the tabletop. If the card played is the lowest denomination of that clan (suit), it is played face up and its special power takes effect. Otherwise it is played face down. The players continue to the end of the skirmish, when all the cards are revealed. Highest total wins, and gets to take a card for scoring. Winner is first to forty points, which seems to take about 6-7 skirmishes (with 5 players).
The game is fine; there is plenty of scope to use the special powers, to accumulate sets and strong cards during one skirmish to play during the next. It is useful to keep close attention to the cards collected by opponents. But the rules are poorly presented and difficult to reference, which makes learning the game tedious and difficult. Lords of Scotland repays the effort, but the rules should have been proofread by someone new to the game.

RATING: 6
The deck is made up of 8 or so suits valued between 1 and 12. Cards are turned over equal to the number of players, and these are the reward points of offer for first, second, etc, this round. Sometimes you'll be playing for big points vs low points, othertimes the spread won't be so much where it'll be a chance to play your less useful cards. A round is made up of 5 actions each, taken 1 at a time in turn. An action is to either draw from the draft or play to the table. At the end, highest total face value on the table wins, and if you've played nothing but one suit, it scores double. Which all sounds quite mundane so far, but what sets this apart is that each suit has a power to manipulate things - swap cards, discard cards, draw cards, etc. But the power only takes effect if you play the lowest valued card so far (across the whole table in a 3 player; with more players it's in that particular suit only). Which makes for hard decisions when you're drafting ... do you go for low cards for the option to play the power, or go for the high cards for the face value. There's an advantage to going first in the round because you can play a high card and still execute its power, or play low and limit others the chance to play powers. The advantage of going last in a round though is that you get to see what others are playing and have the final play - although cards that don't have their powers executed are played face down, so you're still flying in the dark somewhat re the final number needed to win. Simple concept, some chaos, lots of luck, interesting enough decision making on drafting. After replay I found that the powers of the suits were just too overwhelming - either to those who go last in the round or to those who trash the VPs - and your lot was too much in the hands of whether others played their powers this hand or next. Traded away.

A basic card game in which you play cards onto the table to have the highest total in order to get the best point card. Cards of different clans add up but if you have all of one clan they multiply. Each clan also has a power which is only activated if it is the lowest current value when played. Nothing very interesting here, but not annoying and there is little downtime, but there are much better fillers.

Lots of card interactions, which can make the game seem a little random at times, but also means you are rarely out of the game. The push and pull mechanism of playing cards and building your hand in intriguing. Felt like the game was a little long for what it was, but I assume that could be easily fixed by playing to fewer points.

RATING: 7.5
Good theme, good game, bad rules. This is quite a unique chaotic card game, which is lots of fun. I like the continuous nature of this card game where you collect more or less cards and then decide to use them depending on how many points are available- which of course is liable to change. 5 rounds each game with a clear progression and good pace. It didn't go down too well as the game is quite unintuitive (which I don't find much of a problem), making the initial hurdle a bit too much for some, especially for such a simple game. Some specific rules are more of a hurdle, for instance the cards that come into effect at the end of the game and how they work with in relation with each other. A worse example is keeping track of the clan that allows you choose a different power. I cannot remember the exact rules as it has been a while, however I do remember this feeling of trying to work something out and feeling lost. Great shame.

Didn't make the cut as my head hurts and I don't like owning games with ambiguity in them. Will always be up for a game though, hopefully with someone who has a definitive grasp of the rules!

The game seems like a good idea, as there are some interesting decisions about what to play next. Do I want to play the high card? Bluff my way to victory (or to defeat and cost of cards to the opponent)? Play a low card to guarantee my opponent can't use his powers?
A big issue I have with this game is that the rules are not completely clear about what to do in certain situations. It is not clear how the clan powers do apply and get into play. Lastly, my wife hated this game from the onset. Event though I like the game, it might end up for trade because of that.

A well-realized set collection game where you compare the strength of your "armies" (read: sets) after a series of lay-offs and draws from a common pool.  The cards have some powers that activate much like Three Dragon Ante, and give the game some spice.  
Not particularly genre-defining, but a fun, accessible card game that can be played fairly quickly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It reminds me a little of Condottiere: you take turns to play numbered cards to build up strength and some of them have special effects. The clever twist is how these special effects work. Each suit ('bloodline' in the lingo of the game) has a different effect, but it only activates if the card played is the lowest played in the round so far. So you get the benefit of the effect, but usually by playing a weaker number. So far I've played three times, and there are lots of neat tricks to try out. Nice to have another game that's as compact in space and time as a filler but has a bit more meat to it.

I really did not like how the number mechanics effectively neuter the powers on cards of a higher number.  If you are playing a game with more than three players, forget ever playing a card for a power if you are anything but one of the first two players.  Sitting there with a middling hand of mismatched cards each round will never put you in the lead, and most times not even if your army color matches, too. In a 5 player game, two or three people are just playing window dressing to those truly in contention.

After a couple of plays in a two-player game, this game really does have a lot of variety and depth you might not pick up on by just looking through the cards.  The instructions could have been much more clearly written (for instance, if you're going to call playing a card in front of you "mustering a clan" don't have the definition of "mustering a clan" in the rules just repeat the words "muster" and "clan" with a few other words thrown in).   Really fun though.  A great little card game.  I look forward to trying it with more people.

One play.  Some nice ideas, but seemed a bit flawed in places - too hard to see which cards have been "activated" at the end of the round (for those that have end of round triggers), and the cards that swop cards from the centre mean that in most rounds the numbers gave out were very low, and the game had outstayed its welcome by the time we finally had some large numbers handed out and the game ended (I peronsally got more points in that round than the rest of the game put together!).

Very good game combining hand-management with bluffing, drafting, and push-your-luck (sort of). The mechanic where only the lowest-numbered card(s) get to do their ability is a really nice touch that offsets the inherent strength of the larger numbers.

RATING: 7
This is fine little game, amazingly portable and quite deep for what it seems at first sight. Games with 4-5 players can feel a bit messy and long, but as soon as anyone catches how the more fiddly powers works, anything runs smoothly. The only concern is that in 2-3 players it may be too easy to shut off powers by playing a very low strenght clan, but it that was not the case, it would be otherwise impossible to stop them with the limited number of cards that are used with few players. 
The art of the first edition is not really as bad as anyone seems to believe, but i guess it's really a matter of taste. Anyone who likes minimalistic styles will probably like it more than the "better" but less particular second edition's one.

Update 2014:

I've had a good run recently playing and teaching this to four different groups - one of them non gamers. Each time it's been well received. The more a group plays the more they find they can anticipate and draw out negative cards. The more they find the timing to be crucial. The more they save certain cards for big plays rather than frittering them away. If players in your group can take a hit and not take it as a personal affront then you should try this little game out. It's a gem that's unlike any other in my collection.

I enjoy the game with three players, with the extra restrictions on card actions, and also with the more open four or five players. They play rather differently, but each has its own charm.

It's about being aware what cards your opponents have been picking up, setting yourself up for a good round and then timing the play of your cards at the right moment. Weaken the supporters when you're building up your deck. Build up good card combinations with your muster and Bruce cards. There's lots of little tricks you'll see after a few plays. There's much more here than I thought at first glance. Feels different to other card games and I really like it.

--------------------
It reminds me a bit of Condottiere, but with more chaos, but good chaos. I'm a fan of Condottiere and Lords of Scotland gives it a good run with ease of play, forward planning, bluffing and powerful combinations. The game length is a good one at under an hour, rules are easy, play is different enough from other games to set it apart. I quite like it.

I like the simplicity of the mechanic that while low point cards give you the action they don't give you many points towards winning supporters. Add to this the eight different roles and you've got a game with the right amount of choice on your turn, but not so much that the game drags as players over think their turns. They've put together an elegant card game here (unlike any other I own), and that makes it into my top tier of card games.

Lords of Scotland -- 

If you think you might like this, heck it's cheap, so give it a try.

As we went over the rules before our first play, I was concerned about two things:  first, that it would be rather haphazard; and second, that it would involve a lot of "take that".

As we played, however, it became clear that these factors can be mitigated by the players if they choose to allocate their actions to do so.  I was pleasantly surprised by the smoothness of play.

Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first: art is terrible. Rulebook barely passable. It shows this isn't really a Z-man production, they just published it. Pity. If this would be produced professionally, it would be much better. Theme is whatever. 

Gameplay is interesting, even if far distanced to Condottierre. Inside that terrible art lies an interesting hand management game with take that elements and a control system to keep them in check. Writing this I realise the game isn't that bad, just ugly looking. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played once with 3P. I'm not really quite sure how to classify this card game as it's pretty different from anything I've played before. In a nutshell, there will be a few VP scoring cards placed out each round. During their turn, players either draw cards or play down cards, either face up or face down. At the end of 5 turns, players add up the values of the cards played down, and a multiplier is given if there is a set from the same clan. The player with the highest total value takes a VP scoring card of his or her choice, and the player with the next highest value takes one of the remaining cards, and so on.

What makes this interesting is that powers can be triggered during the game by playing a card face up. The catch is that the card's value must be lower than the current lowest valued card played face up. Despite the rather complex rules, Lords of Scotland is a light game where you need a little luck on your side. Still, there are some critical choices to be made in this game, such as when to play cards face up. Players also have to maintain some momentum as hands carry over from round to round. This is an OK filler game, although the art and graphic design look a little slipshod.

 All I can say for sure now is that the visuals are not good which makes the game not appealing to us. We will try to make a set with different design and retheme it(yes, feudal Japan, you guessed correctly)and come back with further rating and comments.

This is a very good, quick-playing game of hand management and blind-bidding (sort of). There's a bit of take-that, but not bad at all. Quite enjoyable!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup (n player game):
- Random start player gets Victor's Initiative (VI) card
- Deal 5 cards/player, 5 face-down cards in Recruit Row, and n face up in Supporter Column (if all Supporters have same number; discard all, and replace until they do not)

Game Play:
Play 5-round skirmishes until someone wins. 

Each Round:
- VI-holder flips a Recruit face up.
- Start with VI and go once around. Players either:
... take a Recruit (max 10 cards in hand); refresh with card from draw deck, maintaining face up/down status.
OR
... Muster a card from hand to your Army (personal Display) face up or down. If face up, and card value is lower than any other face up card in all players' Displays (for 4-5er game, only consider cards of same "bloodline"/suit), may use the suit power.

After 5th Round:
- Reveal cards in your Army and sum their values.
- If all cards are same suit, double value.
- In order from highest to lowest non-zero sum (ties broken by highest unique numbers on card), players add an available Supporter to their score piles.
- Game End?
... If anyone has 40+ points in their score pile, the game ends; player with most points wins (tiebreaker = higher position in last round).
... If not, discard all cards in player Armies, Recruits, and Supporters. KEEP any cards already in your hand. Rebuild Recruits and Supporters, then play another skirmish.

My favourite abstract card game by a country mile. 

What's great:
Has plenty of strategic options ,yet feels light and accessible for non-gamers
The special abilies of each of the 8 clans and the fact that the ability can only be activated if it matches or is lower than the lowest card in play.
The variety of card abilities that make for lots of different strategies.
Being able to swap the scoring cards available during the game.
Being able to be double the armies score by playing a matching coloured card.
Easily undestood rules, especially after one 5 round skirmish has been played.
Inexpensive but with quality card stock Strategy can be developed and is less given to wild swings of fortune, as in Condottoirre.
Has plenty of strategic options ,yet feels light and accessible for non-gamers

What's to hate:
Some ambiguities in the rules
No symbol to identify which are end of turn abilities.
Slightly amateurish Artwork.

Slightly ropey rules (or maybe we were trying to understand them too late at night after a drink or two).

Rather enjoyed the game itself - 5 rounds of playing cards in front of yourself or drafting a new card. Some played cards give special actions. After each round VP cards are awarded based on strength. It's in the actions (& the rules enabling them) that the game stands out.

Memorably crappy artwork. I say that in a nice way.

Hard to judge this game properly since my one play was with my regular game group who for the most part don't like pure card games. I enjoyed this while the rest of the group, predictably, did not. I thought the card powers allowed for some clever play without getting overly complicated and bogging things down. Several of the other players, however, did not like the take-that and leader-bashing aspects of the game. Need to play again with folks who are a bit more into card games to see where this finally shakes out in my ratings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a very interesting card game where the cards of each suit have different powers. Since the powers can only be used if the card value played is lower than all other cards played up, player options get smaller and smaller as the skirmish progresses. Plus, a player can play a low number right off the bat if they know the other player has some powerful cards in hand with higher values. Should be interesting to play with 3, maybe 4 players, but the control level will likely decrease. Should have good replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent card game that consistently offers the players plenty of difficult decisions to consider.  Do you play a low numbered card faceup to ensure you can take advantage of its special power or do you play a high numbered card facedown to try to sneak your way towards winning the highest available VP card? Or do you instead play a relatively low card facedown as a bluff?   Do you draw a faceup card that fits your needs but will reveal your plans or do you take a risk and draw a facedown card to give nothing away?  Do you play your cards now to try and earn the available VP cards or do you bide your time by drawing cards, hoping to have a better chance at possibly higher VP cards in the next round? 

Fans of Condottiere should definitely check this one out as the two games have a similar vibe. But, honestly, this may be the better game.  Highly tactical and strategic.  

Just a hugely underrated gem.  The more I think about it, the more I appreciate it.

Slowly collect cards, activating the abilities of low cards, but higher cards are what score you points.

I like the idea behind this game, but I haven't played it enough to know if it has legs. Rating could skyrocket. 

It seems like three might be the ideal player count.

I really enjoyed this game. The hand management & special powers you can use are very smooth & make the game above average.

Play a serie of 5 turns rounds to draw & play cards & activate their power to try & have the most points when someone hits 40.

Still not sure where my final rating will land. I love the simplicity of the "take a card or play a card" gameplay. I'm just not sure if this game will stay in my collection when compared to countless other great, simple card games (Keltis, Linko, Sticheln, Parade, Mystery Rummy, and more).

For now it's right in the middle, not great but not bad.

Sold.

Reminds me a lot of Condottiere. Play numbered cards in front of you to claim victory point cards. The trick though is that there are different clans that grant you special powers if there are no lower number cards of the same type in play. After 5 rounds you calculate who has the highest strength and that person gets the highest value vicotry card. Second strongest gets 2nd highest etc. The game ends when someone gets 40 VP. Quick and easy.

This is a nice game. Quite refreshing mechanics. If you like card games the type of Condottiere, it is a good one! Play for 50 points. It is more fun!

This one is a good little game.

It has many harsh decisions to be made: recruit or muster? Play a card face up and use its power, or keep it face dowm, hidden, but wasting its power? What to play - a high value card, or mantain the lineage, knowing it is risky, as one card traded can put all to waste? How will play next?

Many questions with no easy answer. Lords of Scotland is somewhat AP prone, since is hard to predict your movement, because the card played before matter a great deal.

There is also the possibility - probability is better - that you will get screwed. This [u]is[/u] a [i]Take That[/i] type of game. And if you hurt someone else feelings, he/she can get back to you, even if other player will win because of that. So, kingmaking can happen also.

Though the game is not without problems, I like if just fine. It plays in about a hour and every decision you make seems to matter. And the price of the game don't hurt also.

A pleasant surprise & this could be a solid 8 if we bump some time on game nights to play it. That the card powers are only doable if the placed card is the lowest of it's suit on the table makes it tick & opens up interesting tactics each hand & for multi-hand strategy. It's nicely cut-throa. Special powers without letting thievery get out of control. The game has a nice flow. Recommended.

Despite the really wonky artwork, I love the game play. In the few that I've played, it's easy enough to teach that I was schooled by the newbs with very little trouble. Yes, that's a good thing! And yet, Court of the Medici remains impenetrable to me. Go figure.

Need some more plays before I rate this, but It seems like a very decent game.  Huge amounts of "take that", but lots of public knowledge of what cards people have in hand allows you to plan for that.

I like the balance struck between playing high scoring card strictly for points and playing the lowest scoring card to use an ability. It makes for an interesting hand management game. 

The art is to die for in the 2nd edition.

One game, four players, three were newbies. Not very intuitive game, we were constantly making illegal moves, checking and double-checking the rules and so on. Felt too complex for a simple card game. I can try this again, but no special urge for that.

Hm.  After the first game, I was almost certain we were playing the game incorrectly.  It seemed too weighted to following one primary strategy -- use the clan that removes another clan from the skirmish -- that I was convinced we had missed a rule.  No, it turns out we were playing correctly, and that just seems to be an overpowered strategy.  Of course, that's just after one play, so things might change, but it's a little too take-that for me at the moment.

Introduction\13\
The throne lies empty and the clans are restless. As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?
\13\\13\
How to Play
\13\
You acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish. The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.

After one game ppl were appreciating it or hating it. It left me quite confused. The rules "lowest value applies the special power" and "same color set doubles" seems very good, they work... but all in all i never felt much partecipation in the game. it wasn't very involving and this is a pity when there are original mechanics. I could try it again and raise the rating.
After a second game, this time with 3 players, i can slightly raise my game but i also notice that the rule "in 3 players count the minimum among all colors" is not so good. anyway, a decent filler

Lovely card game, very reasonable price and a nice blend of longer-term strategy, short term tactics and a dose of luck. Great filler but a good game in its own right, and works really well with 2 players. For the price I'd say you may as well get this and give it a go! My only gripe is that the instructions are a little vague, though the forums helped to clarify some queries we had.

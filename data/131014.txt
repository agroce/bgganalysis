GAME: Carcassonne: Winter Edition
RANK: 769
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Brilliant. Simple (as in elegant). Everybody should have Carcassonne in their collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Everyone should have Carcassonne because it can be played by anyone. Because of some special memories associated with the game, I also wanted to have my own copy. But I wanted to have something different, so I went for the Winter Edition.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I find Carcassonne: Winter Edition to be an unnecessary reimplementation of the original game with the main difference being the artwork. It looks nice though with more detail. However, on some tiles the details can distract the eye a bit since everything look busier. But in the end it is just a matter of your personal taste which one you like more, the original or the winter look. I am inclined slightly for the favour of the original.

The Game is simple but beautiful and even my mother who hates games plays it and likes it. The Winter Edition is only different to the other editions by the grafics but they are nice. I like winter and snow. The problem is, that it is not compatible with the other editions, because they are showing summer. It looks funny having the winter all over the table and some summer dots inbetween.

Hard to rate this very differently from the base game, except to say it has nice art, perfect for the holidays, and the tile selection is interesting. The Gingerbread Man extension gives this game its unique flavor, but it's not a game changing addition. Not an essential piece of my Carc collection.

RATING: 7
Basically just the core Carcassonne set with winter themed graphics. One mini Gingerbread expansion, which is very luck driven and perhaps tends to help people already doing well-- but a fun variant to play at Christmas or whatever,

It's Carcassonne only more Winterry. We know. It's not a real word but that pretty much sums it up. One of the great gateways with better artwork on it. There is just something so simple about the tile placement. By the way we don't actually play with the meeples as farmers. I know. I know. We can hear the die hard gamers screaming, "Then you aren't playing it right!" But the one time we tried it just dragged the game out. So we play it to have fun and that's how we do it. And in the Winter Edition there's even a Wuzzle. Raise your hand if you get the obscure 80s cartoon/plush toy reference.

I love Christmas and therefore Winter themed games really appeal to me. Despite finding regular Carcassonne dull, due to the dearth of Winter themed games I decided to give this edition a try. 

I loved the really beautiful snowy artwork which is perfect for winter holiday season, many of the tiles have charming unique artwork and animals/birds are represented – bears, foxes, deer etc. and even a wolpertinger!, high quality tiles and meeples, relatively small box size although it probably could be even smaller (Kosmos 2 player size) for my preferences, simple rules that are easy to explain, only has a few simple expansions that are compatible (Gingerbread Man, Winter Crop Circles, The Phantom, The Messengers) so you are not overwhelmed with choices...although that could also be a negative for some...

However, despite its gorgeous looks there are many, many tile placement games I like better, it seems too simple (and therefore boring!) for me – I keep reading about a deep underlying strategy but I don't see it especially when I, as a real newbie to the game who can't even grok farmer scoring properly, can beat a really experienced player with hundreds of games under his belt. Does not compute, and so it solidifies my opinion that the game plays you with the 'draw 1 place 1' mechanism. Luck dependent to a certain extent on tiles – sometimes you get just perfect tiles and the other person doesn't, but no doubt in the hands of a master Carcassonne player they can probably find something clever to do.

It's Carcassonne with snow on the tiles and a couple of minor tile tweaks. Wife bought it by accident (meant to get original Carcassonne)at a FLGS.

Reissue of Carcassonne's base game with different art: instead of green grass, it's white snow, and some of the buildings look a tad more Russian. The advantage to getting it is twelve additional tiles not in the original base game — plus, if you can find a first edition, there is the gingerbread man expansion that gives more tiles… and a lot more points because the gingerbread man awards one per tile whenever a town is completed or it has to move.

PLUS: extra tiles, you can double up base tiles if played with the base game
MINUS: this is mostly duplication if you have the base game (so appeals to completists and those who don't have it more)

Carcassonne: Winter Edition is Carcassonne in a beautiful winter landscape.  While Carcassonne isn't new at all to me, this is the first one I got to play on a tabletop.

A new basegame with new artwork. Due to an extensive Carcassonne regular set, (with more expansions than necessary)I decided to buy a 2nd set so the game will not look as overwhelming when I try to convince new players to play the game with me.

That said, this game can be combined with the following expansions/parts of expansions:
- Gingerbread man
- Bridges (from bridges, castles and bazaars)
- Castles (from bridges, castles and bazaars)
- the abbeys (from abbey and mayor)
- Miniexpansion 2 Messengers
- The king (from king and scout)
- The scout (from king and scout)
- The follower
- Shepherds + Sheepdrawing(from hill and sheep)
- The chieftainmeeple (from inns and cathedrals)
- The cart-meeple (from abbey and mayor)
- the Mayor-meeple (from abbey and mayor)
- The farmbuilding (from abbey and mayor)
- Buildermeeple (from traders and builders)
- The pigmeeple (from traders and builders)
- The fairy (from princess and the dragon)

There is one tile that you expect a monistary on but its not

This is glorious game. Not only are the theme and artwork fantastic, but now that I know more about board gaming than I did back when I first played Carc, I can just enjoy it for what it is: A light, quick game that nonetheless offers interesting decisions and a tight yet calm gameplay experience. It's also great with two.

I much prefer the artwork in this edition to regular Carc. It's a small thing, but it's also not a small thing; it amplifies my enjoyment of the game. I love winter and Christmas, and this game -- like TTR: Nordic Countries -- makes me think of both.

Base Carcassonne with a restyling. It is pretty, but not something you really need and the back (and fronts) are incompatible with expansions. If you're not a Carc collector, it's a fine set, and with the Gingerbread Man expansion is quite fun. I'm not a fan of seasonal games (all games should be year-round in my book) but it's fun to play someone else's copy.

Even though it is incompatible with the expansion sets, I actually like the print quality and theme of the Winter Edition more than the regular editions.  It appeals to the inner Stark, if you have one.  The Gingerbread Man expansion doesn't contribute much and can't be used with the regular Carcassonne.  Still, if you haven't played and don't like expansions, the Winter Edition is a good introduction.

Is it excessive to own the Winter Edition as well as the normal edition?  Probably.  But there is nothing quite like being able to match the version of one's favourite game to the current season.
Also, I have a few expansions permanently mixed with the original set, this then has become my just-the-base-game set.

Basic version of Carcassonne.  Nice winter theme but can't recommend it.  It is nice having a set with limited tiles but I would rather pull out the 10th Anniversary Edition (the meeple box) or Wheel of Fortune.

The tile mix seems off and farms too easy.  Our last game had one field that touched all but a few cities on the edges built at the end of the game.  Not a competitive game.   That being said, if you like that kind of game this version is for you.

RATING: 8
A pesar de ser el mismo juego que el clásico Carcassonne, me parece que el tiempo dedicado al diseño y manufactura no fue el mismo. Por alguna razón no todas las losetas encajan como deberían (muchos de los caminos no quedan alineados). Además fuera de la mini expansión que viene con el juego, éste no puede jugarse con otras expansiones y no posee ninguna regla adicional para darle algún "plus" a esta versión. Dicho lo anterior, sigo teniéndole una alta estima sólo por ser Carcassonne un juego muy especial para mi :)
 ----------
Even though this is the same as Carcassonne, I feel the time they put on designing and manufacturing it was not the same. For some reason not all the tiles fit as they should (many roads do not line up). Also, apart from the mini expansion (Gingerbread Man) that comes with the game, this can not be played with any other expansions and it does not have any different or extra rules to add up something to the gameplay. With that said I still have a very high esteem for it, mainly because Carcassonne is a special game for me :)

RATING: 8
As i'm not fan of games with thousand of expansions, i prefer this one over the regular Carcassonne. It's almost the same game but with a much better artwork and some extra tiles. 
The extra tiles reduce de power that the farmers has in the original game and balance them more with the knights, monks and robbers.
Ps: If you think about it, in this version you have snow farmers, wich a weird concept.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think Carcassonne is almost perfect. I love the design of the winter edition and have introduced many non gamers to the game with immediate delight. I love that moment, about 3 tiles in when they grok the game and you see them relax and enjoy tile and meople placement. Charming, endlessly replayable, chilled out and a masterpiece of family board game design.

[b]Carcassonne: Winter Edition[/b] was traded away in a math trade 9/21/14. (Received Pastiche: International Edition)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Carcassonne is one of my wife's favorite games so I thought she would like the winter version, turns out she prefers the original with Inns and Cathedrals.
Since we only need one version of Carcassonne I traded this one away (another victim of the Jones theory).
I still loved the artwork in this edition, especially the tiles with animals.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7.5):[/COLOR]

[i]We live in the NE were snow is plentiful so I love the new art. Also the animals added to some of the tiles are beautiful, especially the birds. I also like how the roads are more organic and not perfect curves. The simple addition of the gingerbread man adds some meaningful decisions to the game. You can score quite a few points with him if you plan well. There is also a larger tile selection than the base game, including a better variety of tiles with different shapes/features.[/i]

Carcassonne Winter-Edition is Carcassonne with snow, basically. To be honest it looks much better than the real Carcassonne.

Since there are only two expansions (so far) this is great for a quick Christmasy game of Carcassonne.

If you want to have more fun play the real version since there are so many more options to expand the game.

Just like original Carc but with really beautiful winter art.  It also included the ginger bread expansion which adds nice little perk for city building.

The base 72 tiles get an art update to be all wintery and the game adds a gingerbread man for some extra rules. 
Based on artwork, it wouldn't be very compatible with most expansions. You could maybe get away with adding the meeples or followers from most expansions (as opposed to tiles), and you could play with Abbeys, but everthing else would look odd.

Original Carcassonne rating 8, winter edition 7 because this is the same game only with a new look. Ok you have 12 aditional tiles, but the rules are the same and you can`t play with expansions from the base game. Looks nice and maybe in winter you prefer the winter edition, but you don`t really need this version. If you don`t have any Carcassonne buy the basic version (compatible with expansions).

The game play is awesome but we did not like this winter version because it doesn't mix with any of the expansions.  If this is the only version your going to own then its fantastic.  If you plan to get the expansions then I'd recommend getting the original version.

Feb 2017: Rating +1.   Continue to enjoy this game!
Oct 2017: Added Gingerbread expansion!  Adds a new twist and is easy to integrate.  Leaving rating as is even though we don't play this *as* much - I suspect it will be coming back into our rotation more in the winter season.

I bought this edition because I thought it was pretty.  I don't yet have any expansions and my only complaint with this edition is that expansions won't match thematically.  You can still fit them together, but you'll have green fields touching snowy fields, etc.

I wasn't sure I'd like Carcassonne, but I discovered this is a game where the box just doesn't do it justice.  This is a GREAT game!  It's quick to pick up and understand (one of the best gateway games I have played) but has enough strategy behind it that even seasoned gamers will enjoy it.  There's definitely an element of luck, but it's up to you to build a strategy around it.

Every time we pull it out the game plays a little differently.  Sometimes there's back-stabbing going on when someone claims your road (or cuts off your attempts to connect your city to theirs) but it's all in good fun. Sometimes we have sprawling cities and long roads and other days our monasteries are the biggest point-earners.

Just as fun with 2 as it is with 3-4.  I would be hesitant to play with more than 4 because you'd get a lot less tiles to work with over the course of the game.  2-3 players feels just about perfect for me without any expansions to add more tiles.

RATING: 8
Because Carcassonne became our favourite family game to play over Christmas we purchased this winter edition as soon as it came out a few years ago. We did not have high expectations and I honestly thought of it as the usual Christmas cash cow. But then this edition turned into my favourite Carcassonne game! The illustration is wonderful, much better than the newer edition of the base game and even nicer than the original one. It features beautiful snow on the roofs of the houses and some animals in the snow. Much love to detail put in here and not cheesy at all.

This edition features some additional tiles (84 in total including the starting tile) that were not included in the original base game and that came with the first expansions. So it already is a slightly enhanced and longer version of the base game without giving you the feeling of being a different game. One thing that annoys me about Carcassonne is that there are so many expansions, mini expansions, special tiles and Meeple. Some of them just mediocre, a few of them quite bland, not many enjoyable. This winter edition has its own cosmos with only two mini expansions (Gingerbread Man and Crop Circles) that bring in some variety but are just some sort of fan service. So if you happen to own this game and the two mini expansions, your Winter Carcassonne collection is complete! Again, this is my favourite way to play Carcassonne, very atmospheric. After all, farming on snowy fields does not make sense thematically, but hey – its only a game.

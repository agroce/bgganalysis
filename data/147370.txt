This game is simple, fun and very well produced. The most interesting mechanic of the game is that players are not allowed to move their own uniquely illustrated turtle, but instead must have another player/parent run the sequence. Sound effects are encouraged, which add to the fun when things don't quite go as planned.

At 4 years old, one of my son's favorite games! We've only played the first two "levels" and my son is very keen on learning the next ones. Grandfather did not like this one as it was too simple (he prefers Monza).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I REALLY enjoyed playing this one.  It seems to overstay its welcome a little (similar to Robo Rally) but the cute factor and the simplicity put it above RR in my opinion.  So grateful to receive this via PiFF!

J, at five, loves this game. She's very chuffed that it was bought for her. The game scales beautifully, from simple obstacle-free operations to ice towers, solid towers, and then sliding boxes, and there's still room to ratchet up the computational thinking. Z, at 9, gets into, too.

Component quality is marginal, nothing special, and disappointing considering the amount of money the KS campaign brought in. The punch-out tiles aren't clean-edged, which is annoying when sliding tiles catch on each other. They could learn a lot from the component quality of, say, Chateau Roquefort.

I have only played the "simple" version of the rules with my four year old. And while he enjoys all of the goofy stuff that the turtles do, he does get a little frustrated when he cant parse how to make the robot go where he wants it to. He keeps asking to play, so its still good for now. I expect in another year or two, this will coalesce much better for him.

I cannot wait for this! I order three copies, two for friends with children and one just for me.
30-12: It arrived! The turtles are so cute. Played a couple of games but even with the grown up rules it's really too simple (as expected). I love it anyway and I look forward to getting it out with a few adults that are not software engineers :D
Have played this quite a bit with children now and they think it's fabulous. Definitely a good investment. The kids ask to play.

It seems unfair to rate this a 6, but I'm trying to find the balance between enjoyment and effect.

"Cubetto" is a physical, actual-robot based version which is more interesting and accessible.

Finding it very hard to rate this game. I love the concept of teaching children to program, and don't know how to accurately rate children's games. I played this once with the "adult" rules, which were severely lacking, and made for a very pale comparison to RoboRally. 
Not convinced teaching children programming concepts needs a board game (Logo worked just fine for me), or that this is the best that can be done in that space.

RATING: 8
I totally underestimated this game but I am so glad I bought it. I actually thought it would be too simple but the fact is my 5 year old son loves it. It's pretty much a puzzle game that teaches a child to direct a turtle from point A to point B. The child uses cards to direct the turtle and they have to figure out which way the turtle needs to move in relation to the destination. Very simple but also gets the brain working and that's what I want for my child. I'll leave a rating when I get more plays in with my son.

Edit: After a few more sessions with my son he is now really enjoying the game. He is now placing cards 3 at a time. On my end I really enjoy sitting there watching him try to figure out the steps to get to the jewel.

The only thing I wish the game had were more variety of cards for the movements the turtle can make. Definitely a solid 8 for what the game does for kids.

I like the concept. I think it does as advertised. It does teach basic programming concepts in a fun way. But this feels too much like that "everyone gets a trophy" mindset. It's fun to watch my kids try to guide the turtle to the gem, but it doesn't feel all that rewarding when they make it. Perhaps I need to come up with my own variants.

I don't know how I feel about this game actually.  I am trying to have the boys just figure the stuff out themselves and add as much of the extra stuff as possible.  It's really about doing it the fastest way, because I don't want any of the kids to not do it as quickly as another.  Locke and Rourke seemed to have a lot of fun.  The part that they had the hardest time with was realizing when they used a turn function it didn't mean turn and move in that direction.  Which is actually pretty cool that we just needed to take a step back to see there is a card for move forward.  It really is only good for the little kids.  The older kids annoy me because it is so easy for them, but it stops it being a learning experience for my little kids.  Not a flaw with the game, just a flaw with my 12 and 10 year olds.  Need to play it more I think.  Also, I just need to make it a co-operative experience, rather than a competitive one.

Difficult to rate this one, as it's not really a boardgame.  

Neat little activity package, where you set up a puzzle on a game board, and let children program their robot turtle.  The object is to issue instructions (turn left, right, or move straight ahead) to your turtle, to successfully navigate it to a gem space.  The instructions are colourful cards, featuring cute turtle/cartoon art.

The game is nicely structured, to add complexity to the puzzles, such as ice walls, lasers (to melt the ice), moveable crates, and so on.  The pinnacle is the adorable "function frog" which can be programmed before the game begins, and the command "frog" can be issued to execute the frog's instructions.

Good little design, and very well thought out.  My five year old son keeps requesting to play it, so they've done something right here.

We've only played the most basic set-up so far, but, wow.  This game is FANTASTIC!!!  It's exciting, it's visually appealing, it's easy to learn the basic codes, and my sons just loved the noises mommy was making as the turtle mover.  I can tell this game is going to get some love.  

Also, as a parent, I have to add that I am so thankful for the high quality production.  The pieces are sturdy, and so are the cards.  The rule book is fantastic - super sturdy, and even includes a section that you read aloud to your kids to give them the basic rules!!!  Wow!  I'm so used to trying to read rules on kids' games quickly while my excited kids are waiting, then having to go into teaching mode.  This rule book does it for you.  Fantastic.  I wish more kids' games did this.

Disappointed. I thought this would be a fun game for my kids, but it is very boring, especially for me, the parent. If the board had a larger grid and there were more tiles then we could come up with some interesting puzzles. But as it is, the board is too course, which makes every game tediously obvious.

Played the galapagos version with my wife.  Pretty fun!  Not sure how replayable it will be...we mixed up the rules on the replay and said no programs under 10 cards (and you have to end up on the gem).  That made it funner.  Looking forward to playing with the kids.

More of a learning aid; not much of a game.  It certainly can get a child thinking in terms of simple programming, but I feel like as the game coordinator that I spend a lot of time trying to make a game of it for the kids "playing".  Great idea, but needed more game to get kids more engaged and involved in solving problems.

Bought this to play with the kids as they get older. Have only played basic game now with my 3 year old and she does pretty well considering that it takes some endurance on her part to finish a whole game.

It does not feel like a "programming" game, though. If on your turn you laid out several instructions to the robot and then executed them, that would be more like programming but one instruction per turn really doesn't have the programming feel.

My boys really like the Lightbot game for android, as this seemed to be a similar concept I thought it might work as a follow up.

They do enjoy it, but it gets a little frustrating for them.  The turns are a lot longer with this game with the bug button retries and thinking over what moves they should make.    I think it'd work better with one adult and one kid playing it, then there'd be a much faster feedback loop for moves.

Solo puzzle, not a game.  Requires an adult to create a maze of tiles for the child's turtle to navigate.  The child plays cards (turn, move forward, laser, etc.) to move, push crates, shoot ice blocks.  The adult moves the child's turtle on the board.  It's a solo kid puzzle that requires an adult.  I Kickstarted this and don't regret it.  It just requires a lot of time and patience from the parent, who doesn't participate in the "game" aspect.  This would be great as a one-player app, with preset levels, or randomly generated levels.  To assist the parents, or for advanced players to play by themselves, the board game should have included a book with maze layouts.  I'm surprised that ThinkFun didn't add one when they printed their version.  All of their solo puzzle games have this.  A young player probably wouldn't benefit from a maze book, because they would make mistakes when moving their turtle on their own (turning left instead of right, etc.).

A helyén kell kezelni. Több helyen azt olvastam, hogy túl egyszerű. Attól tartok, hogy ez nem a játék hibája, hanem nem megfelelő korosztályválasztás. Kimondottan különleges játék, ahol az előrelátást, az irányokat tanulhatják meg a gyerekek játékosan. És azért vannak nehezítési, bonyolítási lehetőségek. Szerintem gyerekeseknek kötelező, de felnőttként inkább csak az az élvezetes benne, ha látja az ember, hogy a gyerek miképpen fejlődik benne és lesz egyre ügyesebb.

This is a logic game amid so many more. Perhaps the programming is fun when you get there, but the play and move is boring. I must be VERY entertaining to prevent my child to get bored. Also, the obstacles are way to obvious. There really is not a lot of challenge. The parts are quality though. Note too that according to bgg, this is not a game and should not have a bgg item number since you can't loose. My rating might change with teh programming part once I try it

I kickstarted this game, and really liked the idea behind it, but the execution (at least for kickstarters) is just a bit lackluster. I'm not getting on the game's case too hard, it just doesn't really have anything to push the game over the edge, and make it seem like they put a lot of work into making the game. It just feels like someone's (awesome) idea translated literally into some game pieces and a board. It's then up to the parent to create the actual game. Again, there's nothing wrong with that, you just see so many other game designers nowadays put so much into their games to make them stand out, and this one is basically just someone's idea of a neat way to teach your kids to think like a programmer, nothing else.

I was excited  by the concept, and the components are very good. Also found the game a bit too simple and simply not engaging. It does fit a niche - perhaps kids 5 and 6ys old only. Even so, it might be better with a better goal or even way to lose. RoboRally might be a better overall choice with some simplifications for children. 

I'm glad to have backed this and happy it has been successful. My hope is that this success will lead to improvements.

This is really more puzzle than game. At its most basic level, the game offers no challenge except to really young kids, which is probably the point. However, if you use most of the obstacles and put the jewels in various places with the idea that you are to go after only one specific jewel, the game takes on an interesting challenge - how do you get there from here?  I like to give the stack of obstacles to my son and let him place everything. I then have to figure out how to reach my goal. If he made it impossible, I have to adjust things a little, but it's fun figuring out how to get around or through everything. I also make sure that he made it possible for him to get to his jewel, but I don't necessarily tell him how to do it.  He has to figure that out for himself, which is interesting for me to watch. If we run out of a specific card (as I came one short on my forward cards the last time we played), it's not that big of a deal.  We just go back to the beginning and pull out what's needed. We have found that we don't really ever use the bug or function cards.

The kids had a good time, but did not enjoy this game as much as most of the games we have played together.

Robot Turtles contains some interesting concepts, but the whole package does not come together very smoothly...

The game components do provide a sandbox with which to explore different methods for exposing the kids to basic programming - but the game rules as written were kind of bland.  

I am working out some variants to try with the kids...

My 3 yr old is thrilled to just move the turtle around the board ... maybe he'll get the gem... if he wants.    Usually,  he would rather melt all the blocks of ice with his laser instead.    I let them play with whatever goals they want.

Blown away! I passed on the KS and was hesitant to try, but was totally amazed to see how engaged my kids were in playing this one. My 6yo absolutely loved this and kept asking to play again. It was really cool to see both my (almost) 4yo and 6yo figure out the game/puzzle. Game has a great and simple way to increase the complexity in a well-reasoned small-step fashion that allowed me increase the challenge for the 6yo and still keep it simple for the 4yo. Really awesome way to actually watch your kids learning in real-time. Kids were super proud of themselves for what they were able to accomplish. I can't recommend enough - please give this a try.

When I saw a cheap copy on a local Maths trade, I recognised it but it wasn't until I saw Tom Vasels emotional review I thought I'd give it a go, mainly as an exercise for my boys to choose left or right from the turtles perspective and not theirs.

Well I was surprised how much my 2 boys enjoyed the game, I think not only because of the simple objective (turtle meet jewel) but they get to tell Dad what to do :-). Once the movement puzzle of getting the jewel is second nature, my 6yo was thoroughly engaged with the puzzle when further obstacles and their types were added (but not at the stage of the function frog, likewise my 4yo isn't at the stage of stone and ice towers). 

As per rules making sounds and movement adds to the animation which the boys get a kick out of, and seeing them thinking and coming up with a solution is just as enjoyable, which makes up for the ok role of the grown up as just a turtle mover. My hope is that the programming concept of Robot Turtles will be a hook to move interest to another programming game: Caribbean.

When I read the BGG definition for a 1, I see "Defies description of a game". All is there : is this a game? I would characterize it as a good tool to teach a young kid some rudiments of programmation. But it's not a game in the sense of a competition between players or even a cooperation against the game. 

I must admit that my 6 years old kid like to play with it alone: he imagines stories and routes for the turtle. He then uses the cards to move the animal to the jewel. But that's not my definition of a game. A game is more social.

BTW my 3 years old daughter doesn't want to play the game.

As others have said, it's not really a game. But that could be said of most children's games. At least this one gets my little man thinking ahead. I got it for him to celebrate his first day of preschool. It doesn't get played all that much, but it's always fun for him when it does. He loves it. After only a few plays, he understands how it works and is using function cards proficiently. He now prefers being the turtle mover especially when he gets to melt the ice with lasers. Kudos to the creators for adding lasers to the turtles and for choosing turtles. Turtles are the best!

I perfectly understand people that refuse to accept that Robot Turtles is a game. Ofcourse you could make it a game by changing some rules, but Robot Turtles has a completely different purpose.
So I believe that rating it as a "game" it would be a 1 or 2 (because of the components quality)
But this should be considered an education tool, and as such I think it shines. It is really amazing to witness thought progress of little kids while playing it. I was impressed how different was my 4 year old daughter's reactions between games, I saw her clearly learning by this one. And as much boring and dull it seems to an adult, kids keep asking for it!
So all in all. If you have kids between 3-10 y.o. get this one! It will offer more than it asks, and its lifetime can expand if you are willing to spend some time building clever labyrinths for older kids.

First game that my son really enjoyed.
Basically you create a maze in the board using different obstacle types (some can be destroyed, others moved and some are in filed position).
Each player controls a turtle that has to move through the maze in order to get to a diamond.
In order to move the players use "programing" cards from a personal deck of cards to dictate the turtles move (like a console joystick)

This looks and acts like a board game, but I don't think it is, really. I'm not rating it because, as a game, I'd have to score it no better than a 6 - but as a product, as an activity with kids, as a way to teach programming concepts, as a puzzle my son likes to solve, it deserves much better. I'd definitely recommend it for kids who like jigsaw puzzles.

I'd be wary of paying huge money for this, though. I'm not impressed with the production values - the artwork on the board is starting to come unglued after only 3 gentle sessions.

Fun for small children, but we needed to house rule it for my 7-year-old to stay interested. My kids love to move the turtles and make sound effects so we pretty much threw out the rule of only one "turtle mover" who can't play cards. Alright if you've got small kids or kids that aren't used to playing anything more complex than Candyland, but there are really much better kids games out there.

Hard to say how to rate this.  Is it really a game or just a learning exercise?  Certainly a fun activity when played by the rules with the kids though even with them enjoying the funny noises I make they seem to wish they could move their own turtle.  Of course, I see why it is necessary for them to really learn the difference between what they want to happen and what the cards they choose make happen.  All in all its not bad... but I don't know that the kids or I are terribly excited about it.

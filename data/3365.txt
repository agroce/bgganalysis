Masterpiece. I wish there were more games like this out there. If you like to solve mysteries, noire films and movies, read a good story and put your brains to work as a hard bolied detective, don´t miss this one out if you have the chance.

A lot of work went into creating this game, which was published by the same Sleuth Publications that produced the iconic Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective series.  It is far more complex than the Holmes game, which is both good and bad.  This isn't a game for the casual gamer.   But it does give you the feel of being a detective, especially in the realm of forensic examination.  You even examine finger prints found at scenes and compare them to prints of known criminals!  Not for everyone, but for some it will be great times!

Kind of like the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, but in San Francisco.  The cases look like they interlock and can be run as an entire week if you want.

Uses the 'time' system, which means you might get different results depending on when people are home or at work, which theoretically can increase replayabilty.

Still - once you know the answer, is there still a game here?

RATING: 6
I did really want to like this one - and there's a lot here to like, with so much background and many sources to check - but it seems I'm useless at this type of private eye sleuthing (or it's just too subtle/hard for my level of experience, which is low).  Maybe with more time to invest in studying the background and/or not trying to play to the strict (at least they seemed that way) time rules would help.

RATING: 8
A huge, epic work that is ambitious and very engaging.  Falling in love after only a single play.

Subsequent plays did reveal that this is quite flawed, although I am enamored with the ambition and the execution is still pretty great. Would love to see this re-worked and reprinted.

The box holds a massive amount of information -- for example, there are not one, but two phone books(!) in there.  I can't imagine playing this any way other than solitaire, as the mechanics don't go much beyond simply reading and taking notes.  Still, it looks pretty interesting, and it's certainly unique.

Finally landed a copy of this. I love Sherlock Holmes Consulting Det. and have been looking for a copy of this one for years. 

And...after getting it out to the table, it's not quite as good as Consulting Detective, but it's still a fun "choose your own adventure" type gaming experience

On one play (five separate one-hour sessions), it seemed to me that the available clues are insufficent to offer proof of one's conclusions.  Frustrating.  Likely won't play again.

An intriguing co-operative mystery game. Flawed because there's a lot of waiting time (only one book to pass around, even though all of the players are off on their own investigations, which all require constant reading of the book). I played it when I was young and naive, and didn't have a clue what was going on, and we failed to solve any of the crimes. Now that I'm old and naive, I'm not sure I'd fare any better.

An odd game this. I played it a long time ago, with a friend, and never really finished it as far as I recall. Nice components though - attempting to replicate the paraphrenalia of a hardboiled detective, compete with phone books and fingerprint sheets. I liked the idea, and my gf of the time was very into film noir...

A great evocation of the genre, adding a layer of complexity with time progression and multiple choice that more or less pays off - there feels like a lot more at stake than in Consulting Detective, and it's nice that the team have to decide how to split up. Less convinced by the cases being blurred between sessions, but still looking forward to tackling the whole box.

Man, wanted this to be a lot better than it was. A hardboiled PI version of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective? Sign me up, broseph.

Unfortunately, Gumshoe makes the mistake of not having self-contained cases; most are literally impossible to solve on the first day, requiring clues from subsequent days to get all the answers to the mystery.

Which wouldn't be a problem in itself, IF THE GAME TOLD YOU THIS. Instead, you're left scratching your head thinking you missed something somewhere, when in truth you just haven't played the next case yet. Frustrating, especially given the high quality of writing.

Never received expansions the way SH:CD did.

I would like to buy Gumshoe, the Hard-boiled Detective in the Thirties, by Sleuth Publications as I really enjoy the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective game I have of theirs.  If you have a complete game, in good condition, to sell, could you please email me so we could organise my buying it.  I live in England, but that shouldn't be that difficult.  Many thanks.

"Super-thematic co-op mystery-solving game. Must play through all the cases within a couple weeks, because the cases overlap, so there is no clean stopping point. Be sure to get the errata!  It turns out my wife and I shouldn't quit our day jobs to start a detective agency."

What I like:
- The detail of the components is amazing!
- I like the 1930's San Francisco setting
- You really do have to think like a detective and follow leads to solve crimes.

What I don't like:
- Each game "day" (probably a gaming session) may have some cases ending, some ongoing, and some new ones starting. So you really need to play all 9 days within a fairly short timespan to avoid forgetting what you learned.
- The mysteries seem VERY difficult. Maybe we're just terrible detectives, but we could have used more help.
- The game is completely unplayable without the errata booklet (not just the original half-sheet errata)
- Some leads burn many hours and give you nothing in return, without even a way out after you start.
- Component quality is uneven--some cardstock, some bound books, and some plain paper sheets. 
- The 1930's setting comes with a lot of smoking, and a bit of authentic racism and sexism, which can be slightly uncomfortable. 

Like its predecessor (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective), this game is very open-ended. YOU have to decide what leads to follow, and sometimes it's not clear where to go next. But... 

We realized we played the first 2.5 days wrong. I hadn't noticed in the rules that we are allowed to look at the autopsy and crime scene reports at any time. After a super-frustratng fourth day, we gave up. We read the mystery answers, and don't plan to play again.

I would recommend a single-case-at-a-time game like SHCD before taking on this one.

A game from the same stable as Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. Set in 1930s San Francisco, it evokes the hard-boiled Sam Spade/Philip Marlowe detective and seemed more complex than the Holmes. More suited to multiplayer rather than solitaire owing to the greater number of clues and story strands in the scenarios. Indeed, the rules, as I recall, recommend a games master (being the detective agency boss) to coordinate proceedings, complicated by the fact that each player can only communicate with another if they are in the same game location at the same game time. 

I think that with the right group of enthusiastic detectives this could really be the game it should be. Unfortunately, It just wasn't the right fit for my group.

I rated this game a "9" because it has the best components of any game I have seen.  From newspapers to fingerprint files to autopsy reports to TWO lengthy fake phonebooks, maps... the pieces of this game are incredible.  I looked for this game for a LONG time.  The game was eight years out of print when I finally was able to get a copy... by chasing down the authors and calling them at their home!

RATING: 9
I'm not neccessarily enthusiastic to play this with others, or to start again, but our two plays to date have lasted over ten hours as we refuse to pull ourselves away from the cases.

The rating is somewhat provisional until I look at any of the answers and see how my interpretations match up with reality, but the cases seem exceptionally well put together. They have a logic to them but there are enough dead ends and false leads to keep you on your toes.

The texts are also extraordinarily well written; we have found ourselves on a number of occassions reading a sentence or two to each other from a clue - strictly against the rules, but it seems such a shame when the other person won't get to experience such wonderfully pulpy writting.

Update: Now we've completed this, I can fairly rate it. We (I) got one case completely wrong but we were spot on with everything else. It felt deeply satisfying and the cases felt really well written. It'll be many years until we can pull this off the shelf again and play through it, but I'm looking forward to that day.

Rating up from 7.7 to 9.

Brilliant game that would be 100% unique, if not for the very similar [i]Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective[/i].  I do like the changes to the system included in Gumshoe, such as the tracking of time, the ability to split up while following leads, and the ability to travel to other areas.  It really feels like you're poring through evidence like a private dick while playing.

The stories are fun and well written, but with more than a dash of... let's call it "quaint" racism.

RATING: 9
This is for solo play.

The gameplay is a 7, but I give this a 9 for the shear ambition, components and atmosphere of the game.

The game is filled with amazing detail and good writing.  It really brought me into the world of the game.

The game is very well done.

It is difficult to keep track of all of the simultaneous cases and even with extensive notetaking I felt a bit overwhelmed.  There were also times when I would hit a dead end and it was difficult to know what to do next.

As others have mentioned there really is not enought time in a day for one detective to properly cover all of the bases.  

Also, it is difficult to know when you have solved the case.  There are no literal smoking guns so you never prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.  At some point you just have to feel secure you know what happened.  The solutions do however make sense and are definitely possible to arrive at without knowing everything or following all leads.

This game really is a delight and has replayability as you will not be able to solve all of the cases before the game is over (on my first play I was shot on day 5 and woke up in the hospital on day 9, the last day of the game. : ) )

I think everyone should take a crack at this game at least once and even when I have completely played it all out I am keeping it because it is so unique and well done. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 2.5

RATING: 9
Quite a bit more engaging than Sherlock for our group. The mugshots, fingerprints, autopsy reports, crime scene reports / ballistics, and time system all improve the base game, while admittedly adding to its complexity. The cases being spread out instead of neat self-contained packages adds to the complexity as well. I wouldn't recommend this for any but the most intellectual groups, but for them it's a real treat.

One house rule - give your players ample access to 'payphones and a good secretary' so they can more easily communicate with each other than what the rules allow.

Same great gameplay as [gameid=2511], but with a time element added in.  There's even more stuff in this gamebox, and the cases are more integrated with each other.  As such, it's better to treat this whole thing like a campaign, rather than just the one-case-at-a-time gameplay that SHCD has.  The interleaving of the cases makes this unapproachable as a single evening experience, but the atmosphere is richer as a result.  I ever-so-slightly prefer the Sherlock cases, as they're inherently more directed and thus playable, but this is quite good on its own merits.

I own the first edition plus the errata. Clearly this edition has problems but it is a must-have/must-play for me simply because:

1) the components do such a great job of bringing the theme across

2) I am a huge fan of Hammett/Continental Op. The narrative feels legitimately like an Op story. 

I am not crazy about the overlapping cases, but our attempt to play one case at a time met with frustration since days can pass before something significant happens. So, in the future (case 2 and on) we will have to find some way to concentrate our effort to see all of the cases through.

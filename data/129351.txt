I played this game in Essen 2012 and bought it. Our first game with friends was a good experience. It has very high replayability as the board is random.
You get to choose the tools you carry with you. As the board is random it encourages you to be prepared and to have everything with you at the beginning, but once the map has been opened up you have to plan ahead and take what you need is necessary with you especially if you are trying to compete for bonus points.

A very light game and interesting.  We'll continue to play it I'm sure of that.  It is luck dependent for the tiles that get explored.  But if you expect this to be just a simple, fun game you'll enjoy it.

A játék szép, de totál lapos a játékmenet, semmi gondolkodást nem igényel, teljesen mechanikus az egész. Lehet variálni a hátizsákkal, de végső soron úgyis csak szerencse az egész. Nincs más dolgunk, mint menni előre, folyamatosan felfedezni, és ha épp van nálunk megfelelő eszköz, akkor bemenni az új terembe (nagyon ritkán fordul elő olyan, hogy nem éri meg). Néha pedig vissza a bázisra vagy a sátorhoz kajáért. Oké, nevezhetnénk dilemmának, hogy mennyi kötelet vigyek, vigyek-e oxigént vagy csónakot, stb. De hiába viszek oxigént, ha nem jön ki vizes lapka, hiába viszek csomó kötelet, ha épp nem jön mélység, stb. Végső soron minden csak a lapkákon múlik, semmi dolgunk, csak menni előre mint a hülye... A sátor lenne az egyetlen, ami ötletes, ha nem sütötték volna el már a K2-ben.

I really want to like this one - the components are nice, the theme is good and I generally like the type of game where you build the board as you go along - but it is essentially just random! Perhaps because on the whole you just go off and come across whatever you come across. You can't really control the outcomes and you are either carrying what you need or you aren't - any planning is completely blind.

This game is pure stress and frustration, frustration at the choices you have made. For me though, I really liked it. 

The game severely punishes miscalculations, but due to the fiddly scoring system, it can be very hard to see how the game rewards you. The absence of a positive feedback mechanism may make some run for the hills.

It can create quite an atmosphere when played with the soundtrack.

I'm a caver, so this game is an absolute must have.  Does a great job of simulating cave exploration.  I would recommend any caver get this game.  I enjoy the random tile draws, and it's difficult to know who is ahead based on the end scoring.  Both of those will be drawbacks to some players.  This is a good game, but not a great game.

its okay,  We played it twice, the first time with some rules confusion and the second time with they worked out.  Its really isn't a game I would chose to play.   its fiddly and its not a theme that really speaks to me in a abstract board game way.  I'm sure it would be amazing to explore a cave like this someday but that would be different.

RATING: 8.5
Great competitive push-your-luck and resource management. I imagine, as in reality, the length of time at the limit of exploration being about cataloging and describing the farthest reaches of the cave system and the bragging rights the winner gets from being able to stay down the longest and farthest in. Huge thanks to Nelson Cox (GamingCoupleGA) for passing this along to me!

RATING: 8
Great exploration game where you have to load up and then delve into the cave and get experience tokens that are points but you have to make sure you have enough energy to experience as much as possible going to and from the starter tile for more supplies so you can go and look again. See what depth you can get too for extra points too. Good Fun. 1 Play.

I really didn't like the game. It always felt like a very tedious task to "go explore" but only so far, so that you will still be able to reach base-camp to restock supplies.

The tile draw can make a nonsense of clever planning. You can't aim to go the deepest or take the most photos; it will just happen so how well you do is largely down to the luck of the draw except for ensuring you have enough food so you don't end up crawling back through the cave. I like the backpack and tent mechanics.

Exploration and resource management, combined in a very attractive package. Good production values, and balanced mechanics. A truly solid game, but... a little dull. If only it featured collectible assets (such as fossils of varying size, requiring backpack space) to encourage even harder decisions...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A quick, thematic tile-laying game that works well with all player counts. Stay away if you hate the luck of the draw in Carcassonne, this one has quite some too. Being the type of game it is, I welcome this randomness and uncertainty. 

The game is pure joy to play, and because it is highly thematic and easy to teach (except form the camp concept, ahem), it will be a hit with non-gamers too. There are strategic decisions to make (whether to focus or to go broad with exploration, whether to follow other players or wander off alone), but most of the decisions and tension comes from the tactical situation at hand. Should you go back now, will you push your luck and try to go further and risk running out of supplies, which tokens to pick to gather majorities vs. your opponents) etc.

A good family game. Recommended.

RATING: 7.8
Great game that really makes you think ahead. If you don't plan your trips well and pick a good selection of items, you'll be left stranded in the dark and lose valuable time. Time others can use to explore and score points!

RATING: 6
No rating after one play, but a few comments: Lots of tiny fiddly bits with annoyingly bad art, in the sense of not printing point values on all of them. Also far more than you need, even in a 5-player game and no bags included to put them all in.

Has some similarities with K2 and Lost Valley in gameplay but feels tighter and more claustrophobic than either (I guess that's thematic at least) but not as 'clean' as K2 I felt.

I found the bag packing a little frustrating and I wonder if I would make some house rules after repeated plays. Maybe I just need to get used to it.

First play didn't quite live up to hopes but I did enjoy it and perhaps need to play with fewer than 5 to make the most of it, especially now I have the rules down.

Update:

Now played with 3. I actually think 4p might be the best, but I'm not going to get that far as I'm done with this game. Still the rules are confusing, but mainly it's the gameplay: too slow and uninspiring, and although I love random tile placement there are just too many opportunities here to go on a great explore and pull out useless tiles, wasting turn after turn running backwards and forwards. I wanted to like it more than this but Tikal fills a very similar hole of action-point exploration but does it so much better and is much more fun.

I got this game because I find spelunking awesome. The game involves building the board and getting points for special tiles. This causes it to have a great element of luck, which will turn people off. Truthfully after learning to play the game it can be a "light" game but people who do not like too much luck in their games will be turned off.

As a speleologist I simply had to get this game. And I don't regret it at all.

The whole game is setting a very nice and realistic ambience. The mechanics are straight-forward, the right tactics is quite complex however. Due to the great randomness and the interfering fellow teams, a one-fits-all strategy is not bound to work. Sure, over time players tend to display certain tendencies (I always prefer rope-work over diving, just like in real-life), but some caves just force you out of your comfort zone.

Definite recommendation (although I have yet to play K-2 from the same author).

Players take equipment into their backpack, and descend into a cave.  Players take turns to consume a food token, then spend five action points to do things in the cave, Tikal style.  Stuff involves revealing tiles to expand the cave (Carcassonne style!), moving, using rope, crossing subterranean lakes, diving in said lakes, setting up camp, easing through squeeze spaces, and taking photos of pretty places.  The game is all about opening up the map, and pulling in victory points by extracting bonus tokens off explored spaces.  Some points are awarded for majorities in these token types at the end of the game.

This was fun for the first 30 minutes, and there was a certain sense of thematic wonder as you ease down a rope and find yourself 75m underground.  But then the novelty quickly wore off and the game became rather dull and very repetitive.  We quickly entered a dreary cycle of eating our food and rushing back to the cave entrance to restock, before plunging in again.  It turned the game into a 90 minute Carcassonne (a terrifying prospect).  I wonder if the game would improve if you simply ignored the food rules...

A shame, as K2 was so solid.

Meg volt a próbajáték, igaz, hogy csak kétszemélyes változatot sikerült kipróbálnunk még. A doboz grafikája szerintem nagyon jól néz ki, ha nagyon bele akarok kötni akkor hitelesebb lenne ha a szpeleológusunknak nem látszana a kabátszéle, hanem egybe overálban lenne, de ne kötözködjek. Persze kisebb dobozba is simán elférne, ebbe külön simítózacsizva a komponenseket is kényelmesen elfér. A lapkák ránézésre Carcassone méretűek, néhány mm-el nagyobbak, ezekből épül a barlang, járatok, szűkületek, aknák, földalatti tavak és barlangi látványosságok vannak rajtuk (a promón pedig dupla dolgok: tavas szűkület, fényképezhető kürtő stb.), mivel ezekre kell pakolászni a tokeneket így azok elég aprócskák 1 forintos méretűek kb. Nem biztos, hogy mindent tökéletesen játszottunk egy játék után korai lenne komoly következtetéseket levonni, nekem az jött le, hogy: Viszonylag kevés az interakció, nem különösebben konfrontatív (ami nekem nem baj mert pl.: T&E-ben mindig hozzám vágja a lapokat barátnőm)egyesek pasziánsz szerűnek érezhetik. A lapka húzás miatt elég komoly a szerencsefaktora a játéknak (mit húzol és mi van épp a hátizsákodban ki tudod e használni). A játékmenet az akciópont gazdálkodásból áll, amiből "csak" 5 van így jól be kell osztani, mivel egy új lap lehelyezése és arra átlépés alapból min. 2 Ap. A fő nehézséget az adja, hogy mindig legyen kajád vagy időbe vissza érj a bázisra feltankolni (vagy ha van lerakva akkor a saját bivakodba készleteidhez)mert ha nincs akkor minden egyes lépésed 5 Ap.-ba kerül, amíg a többiek jól elhúznak. A race jelleget erősíti, hogy aki az utolsó lapka lerakása utáni 3. körben nem ér vissza a bázisra, az már nem nyert... Összességében nem túl bonyolult, kellemes játék, egy picit szerintem túlárazva -de barlangászoknak kötelező:) 
Ezúton kérjük Adam Kaluza urat a víz és sár álló esetleg foszforeszkáló változat elkészítésére, hogyha 3-4 napot föld alatt vagyunk legyen mit játszani:D

Very unforgiving game system, make a mistake and it is going to cost you, as it would in an actual spelunking environment.

Really thematic and engaging.

A bit fiddly for first play and the rules are not great, however lots to explore with this little gem and I am looking forward to repeated plays of this. 

Not so enthusiastic about the 5 player game as there is very little room for maneuvere i.e if you reach a dead end you are probably going to have to go piggy back off another player where as in the three player game there is more avenue for further exploration if you do hit that dead end.

Not a lot of player inter-action, this is more a sim of cave exploring, but nicely produced. Lots and lots of chits, many quite tiny, but the graphics and feel of the game are good.

This is a fantastic game of exploration that uses a unique theme. You discover & explore a cave system tile by tile, challenge by challenge, equip with resources that you pack from a home base or camp. You can easily get caught up in the adventure of it all, realizing that you are now too deep into the cave without the resources to get back to base. The player interaction is minimal - neither highly competitive, or cooperative - though there is a good bit of policing each other's turns. I think that works ok for this particular game. Game also comes with a downloadable Mp3 soundtrack which heightens the game atmosphere a great deal (we play in the dark with a gas lantern). While the game play is nice, it does have some minor caveats to see through. 1. The initial game setup is somewhat time-consuming with tons of pieces that need separated & no game piece tray is included. 2. Keeping track of depth can be tricky as the cave tiles develop. It takes some caution & experience with marking tiles to get this right. 3. Counting the points at the end is a bit cumbersome, and lacks crescendo effect that you usually get when "winning" a game. 4. Would have liked to see special archaeological discoveries that you can make inside the cave. Something of significance besides taking photos of cave formations. I think this is a terrific base game, and will do some homemade expansions on our own. After some research, found that there is a Pirate's Cooperative & Solo variant available in a Boardgamegeek forum in pdf, and also 12 expansion tiles in the store. We love this game more each time we play!

Not a bad tile placement game, because of it's randomness it's not easy to set up a strategy from the start, you just go with the flow. After half the tiles have been placed, the game becomes more clear for players, where to go, what to pack etc. Even so I consider it more of a non/medium gamer's game, which is not bad, but not what I expected.

Exploring a cave is a novel theme, and it is implemented well, but the mechanics are very familiar, with action points at the core. They work, but strategic decisions seem limited to balancing what equipment you take, when to set up camp and when to go back to the entrance to get more supplies. The last one is crucial, because you must spend provisions every turn, and running out of them means you will be wasting turns slowly crawling back to the entrance.

Otherwise, you are basically moving your pawn, placing tiles and using your equipment to overcome obstacles and to get exploration tokens, which will be scored at the end of the game. Bonuses are given for having the most or second most of each kind of token, but there is very little you can do to pursue majorities, as there is only one token per tile, taken by the first player to explore it, and the tiles are random. There is simply no way to deal with luck of the draw: you take a tile and that is what you get.

The game is quite enjoyable, a nice thematic experience, but it is probably too light to keep most gamers interested for long, and maybe a bit too fiddly to work for most families.

Great tile-laying exploration game.  Scoring rules can be a bit cumbersome, but the theme comes through really well in the gameplay.  Have only played with two, and find it a bit lacking in player interaction (mainly a race to collect points)at that player count.  We have fixed that with a DIY horror survival variant, but looking forward to trying this with more players.

A "dungeon crawler" without monsters. To my surprise the game is not co-operative. It's a race to discover new cave segments. Whoever enters first will get points. You have to think twice which items you want to carry in your backpack because of limited space. You also need to head back to the camp once or twice to replace used equipment and food.  
The game looks (iconography) and plays (race for points) a lot like subterranean Tikal. After a while it was just more of the same and we felt like something was missing from the game. Like maybe some different discoveries or surprises in the form of event cards that would spice up the adventure.

Huge disappointment. The game is mix of Carcassonne and Tikal. It is random, and there are some problems with going down the cave. It is not clear when there are some tiles near, which are on a different levels (different heigt of the tiles). What is more the game is a little bit to long for what it is. After great K2 of this author, The Cave is really not that good.

I like the theme and atmosphere, but it seems like the game ends right as you're really starting to get going. A lot of the time it feels like you're just drawing tiles and seeing what they are instead of strategizing. I think it would be more fun if either you could hold a couple more supplies or it didn't take so many action points to pack/setup/move your secondary camp.

Such a fun exploration game! It feels like a total point salad sandbox where you can win however you want to. Watch out though! It takes careful planning to know just how far you can push yourself into the depths! It's actually really funny to see other players sprinting by you with their full supplies while you desperately try to crawl back to the start tile after some bad planning. It happens to at least one player every game, and it is hilarious!

RATING: 7
An interesting game that matches theme well.  Players lay tiles to explore a cave, and in the process collect victory points for their achievements, e.g. setting rope lines to deeper levels, taking photographs of unique rock formations, scuba diving in underground pools, and so on.  My only complaint is that playing by the rules makes for very little player interaction.  Players are free to explore anywhere, but due to the large number of options, each player essentially explores their own part of the cave, and as a result the points they earn come down to the tiles they draw (save the end game when everyone is scrambling to pick up the leftovers).  There is little direct interaction or strategizing possible to combat this form of luck.  We mitigate the issue by using the two-player game board, no matter how many players there are.  By forcing players into the same cave branches, the decision making becomes a lot more strategic to ensure you, instead of others, get the points.  Otherwise, this is a light, fun, tile-laying game that results in an different cave every time.

This game did seemed really well themed, like a simulation of cave exploring (not that I have that experience, but it is how I would imagine it). There definitely was some skill in trying to optimize your movement, but there is enough randomness from the card draws that it could influence the scoring. So I would play it mostly for the fun of the thematic experience.

Action point mechanism is ok, but bad component choices again mar a rebel release.

Rope/ water tokens etc. could easily have the VPs they are worth and other useful information on them but don't.

The rulebook is not great either - the section on the re-deploying the camp at home base had to be read several times by each player before we just guessed what was meant...

The 'camp' marker is oddly un-thematic and unintuitive - it is not as you would imagine a camp, but a small Tardis that holds stuff that you deploy and refill from. Why you can't just open your back pack and remove the items anyway doesn't really make any sense.

Its unforgiving if you do not plan your actions correctly which saves it a little.

Downtime is not great with 5 players.

The Cave is only the second Polish game to sneak into my collection of 750 games. Mostly, these games suffer from too much chrome hiding a simple structure beneath it in the effort to convey theme in Eurogames. The Cave also has a few rules that are too involved for what basically is an advanced family game. The tent is the main culprit, the depth rule being another one. The positive news is that the game only needs one experienced gamer to take care of them.

Nonetheless, The Cave exceeded my comparatively low expectations given its reception on the Geek. It succeeds in creating a thematic experience on a Euro chassis. The luck factor can be decisive but focused play helps. I wouldn't play it with my gamer buddies but it was a success with casual gamers / couple gaming. For these occasions, The Cave joins [gameid=68182], [gameid=25593] and [gameid=33154].

I liked K2 from the same desinger very much so I was very interested when The Cave was released. But where K2 was an exciting race against weather, the mountain and the other players, The Cave was just... not that interesting. Each player goes his/her own way and hopes to find something worth points when drawing the next tile. When supplies are depleted you go back, resupply and do the same thing again. Random multiplayer solitaire game which even began to drag already in the short demo round I played at Spiel '12.

I liked this game but having played Android Net-runner Infiltration I can't imagine ever playing this again.

Infiltration has a similar "get as far as you can, but get out before the clock strikes 12" mechanism driving the game but with less quirks and fewer moving parts.  

If you're intrigued by the theme and you have a chance to play, this is not a bad game but it plays a little long and a bit fiddly.

One play so far.  My initial thoughts are possibly it sways a little too far towards simulation and away from game due to being very thematic in a spelunking kind of way.

Ok -- but 3 problems: 
1) The running out of food mechanic is terrible. If you didn't plan well (good chance on your first turn) you could end up losing several turns in a row. This would be enough to make this game nearly broken -- but I think if you play this enough, you would be prepared enough to not run out. 

2) Similar to the last issue, but having to go back to base camp causes you to unnecessarily waste time. This was a really bad choice. 

3) Too random. I ended up winning even after losing several turn due to running out of food and playing against 2 experienced players. Why? Luck of the tile draw. i drew several camera tiles in a row. These are easy gets and gave me 2 points each plus I ended up with the 8 point bonus. I also was able to get an easy 75' drop bonus. All of that was luck -- not great planning or strategic decisions. 

I'd play again, but I'm not excited by the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Too long for too little reward, I found this game to be uninvolving and random. It's flip a tile and see what you can do--you can't really plan or try to pursue a certain path to victory (wonders, ropes used, lakes explored, etc), but rather hope you chose the proper equipment and have it on hand to collect the VPs. Bring 2 tanks of oxygen and a raft? Get met with depths you have insufficient rope for! Feeling good with 3 lengths of rope? Encounter squeeze after squeeze!

For an action point allocation game, which generally stress efficient point management, turns often end with a stray VP, just because of unlucky tile draws you can't foresee. And the constant back to base camp thing is a drag--this detail makes it so most of the game, you'll find yourself traversing the same tiles and paths over and over again, and spending actions to reorganize your pack...before you go back the same way and hope to discover new things that will either help or hurt you.

It's a beautiful but dull game.

Wer an der Reihe ist hat 5 Aktionen. Laufen, Plättchen aufdecken (Höhle erweitern), durch Engstellen pressen, ein Foto schiessen, durch Seen tauchen ... usw. Der Clou ist nun, dass man nur einen bestimmten Platz in seinem Rucksack hat und nicht alles aus dem Camp mitnehmen kann. Lass ich die Kamera zurück, kann ich keine Fotos machen, dafür aber mehr Proviant mitnehmen um länger Untertage zu überleben. Ohne Sauerstofflasche oder Gummiboot komm ich über keinen See und ohne Seil steh ich vorm Abgrund und muss zurück.
Ein tolles Spiel, sehr thematisch. Höhlen erforschen und gucken was um die nächste Ecke ist. Dabei natürlich nicht verrecken (Sonst muss man seinen gesammten Zug opfern um 1 Feld zurück zu krabbeln, was einen sehr stark zurück wirft... gewinnen kann man am Ende aber doch.
Bei dem Spiel gefällt mir das Ende fasst am besten, wenn man dann die "fertige" Höhle sieht ;).

Ich bin mit den Promo-Plättchen echt nicht sicher. Sind schon cool, aber ich glaub die machen auch bisschen das Spiel kaputt. Man bekommt einfacher Siegpunkte. Nicht zu einfach aber irgendwie... weiss auch net >.

A very interesting game about "caving" or spelunking.  You take tiles and explore a cave.  You have certain equipment, (rope, oxygen, cameras, underwater equip, etc) that can allow you to explore longer.  You score points by finding certain caves but must return to camp or become lost.  

It is surprisingly fun.  I found the game to be very good, adventure type game.  Although the rules are a little involved, I would say the game is family friendly.  It is well designed.  I am not terribly excited about the theme, but found it fun nonetheless.

While I agree that there are flaws with this game (especially the excessively complicated adding up of points at the end), it is also an enjoyable game. It's got beautiful mechanics and wonderful design. The rules could be clearer on some mechanics, but this is workable. I like tile-laying games, and this is a lovely variation of the idea with an exploration theme that's well accomplished. I enjoy playing this -- but my wife, who doesn't do well with numbers and counting, is less enthusiastic, because she just ends up with memories of "1, 2, 3, 4.... and 5" instead of game play, but that wasn't an issue, interference, or problem for me.

We recently played this again and found that, yup, you spend a bit too much time thinking "1., 2, 3, 4, 5..." and it is distracting from the beautiful thematic of the game. The game could be great -- and interesting tile-laying exploration game, but, man, you never really get to do anything or develop it as far as you would like because you just never have enough food and you never stop counting.

Also, the rule book is severely lacking. There are so many situations that can happen that challenge the established rules and these sorts of things are never, ever explained, which is a pity. That would take some of the frustration out of it.

Most extreme sports are a solitary pursuit.  I suppose caving, though a team effort, is also a solitary pursuit to a great extent.  This game also, though played with multiple players, is an exercise in solitaire.

The Cave is a great experience but not the most gruelling of games per se. I say this because the game is about exploring a cave complex and that is resolved via random tile draws. So what ensues is the need for players to adapt to their surroundings but that does limit decision making and luck becomes a larger factor. 

Building new cave complexes with each game though is very cool and my teenage boys loved the experience. 

Decision making is largely in how you pack your backpack and how to make best use of your temporary camp that can be set up somewhere to make exploring easier and as a halfway point to return to basecamp. 

The scoring rules also allow a player to prioritise, which features they will explore once found.

I just find it really fun.

It's an exploration tile laying game. Usually, each player will go its own way, with minimal interaction, because if some players compete for the rewards, they will waste their movements and both will lose.

Everything is pretty well balanced, so choosing what pieces of equipment and how much food you will carry is key. Nonetheless, with no interaction, the balance of the game will make the scores to be very similar, and most probably the bonus will decide.

The worst part about this game is that there is no objective criteria that can motivate those decisions other than luck. 

Its author also designed K2 and you can notice that at how well those simple mechanics represent the theme. Nonetheless, K2 is a far superior game.

Component quality is good.

It's not a bad experience because of the exploration factor, but luck is too decisive and a game that long should have something more.

There is a decent idea of a logistical exercise hidden in here somewhere but the underdevelopment issues really tank the game.

First of all, the VP tokens: A million different types of VP tokens, with four different point values. The values are printed neither on the tiles themselves nor the player aids. The majority scoring bonuses are not marked on the player aids either.

Second, the rulebook leaves way too much room for interpretation and would hugely benefit from drastic restructuring.

Huge luckfest in the beginning but gets a bit more sensible later in the game.

The gear tokens are all of different shapes, which adds extra fiddliness.

Very dull. And looked lame. Give me Lost Valley any time! In The Cave, you spend actions to move, discovering new regions that will be worth points if explored. Collecting these points uses-up actions and often expends resources as well. It feels like the Explore/Mine cycle from Lost Valley, but at 1:10th of the interest.

Really immersive, tile laying, exploring, critical resource management, spelunking themed game.  We totally geek out on this game more than any other.  We always find cave ambiance soundtracks to play via YouTube and play after dark...in the dark...wearing only headlamps.  Yes, I am serious.  Only two things I would tweak on this wonderful game is that it seems to run a little long and scoring is cumbersome.

In my opinion this is one game where the level of randomness is required to maintain the theme and realism I believe the game designer was trying to achieve. I have explored quite a few wild caves in my time and there was never anyway to predict how the cave would develop. Even under the best laid plans we would end up making many trips due to unforeseen obstacles or conditions. The board game, The Cave, captures this reality with the tile drawing mechanism and can frustrate the best laid plans. I can see this being a source of frustration with many gamers, but I would recommend approaching this game as an experience or exploration rather than a strict competitive event. Bravo for attempting a theme that is really new and for me, one of great personal appeal.

The game is ok. It isn't a very satisfying game though. There isn't much strategy to it, you can plan but you're extremely limited in your movements. Squeezes can really ruin exploration.

There is a bit of fun to have with what happens to your friends but winning or losing isn't satisfying, it just kinda ends.

In my opinion the game needs to be tweaked in some way as to encourage exploration rather than discourage it. From the mid game you will use up half your food at least on grounds you've already covered, especially considering you have to be back before it runs out.

I wouldn't recommend it. Although it is very close to being very nice, it just misses something.

[b]Comment:[/b] This game plays very similarly to Expedition: Northwest Passage. I like Expedition, but I think I might like this even better. You explore this cave by revealing tiles through an action points system similar to Tikal and the mask games. You reveal tiles that have different pictures of tokens on them, and gathering the tokens is a bit different depending on what gear you have on you. There are points for tokens, most of each type of tokens, and then points for depth reached. You want to explore and explore, but if you run out of food, all you can do is slowly crawl back to camp one tile at a time, so it's important to leave enough time to get back.

I'm a fan of Adam Kaluza's K2 but his new 'extreme' game turned out to be less interesting. It has a Tikal-like action point system and Lost Valley-style 'backpacks' of useful equipment. The players set off into the cave, reveal a tile when they get to an edge, and explore the various things they discovered for points. In our game, we all went off on our own, and you pretty much just hoped you got lucky with a tile that you had the equipment and time to explore. I kept drawing dead ends instead, and lost. It also has some daft graphic design decisions. For example, different types of chit are worth 2-5 points in final scoring but they don't have that value printed anywhere on them.

A reading of the rules left me less than impressed.  Explaining the game to the others brought about some "meh" responses (probably reflecting my own preconceptions).  But when we played the game, we all became intrigued and enchanted by it.  The backpack mechanism (planning how far to go and when to come back for more supplies) balanced with how to spend one's available actions clicked very nicely with us.  Yes, folks did run off in their separate directions, but each time back to camp there was the decision of returning to a previous path or trying to take advantage of the work done by others.  Pleasantly surprised and enjoyable as a game.

It seems much more of an "adventure/experience" game with lots of randomness, compared to K2, which was more strategic and interactive. I suppose it is inevitable that an exploration-themed game, discovering an unknown region, will necessarily have a higher luck factor, for better or worse. 

Tons of bits with good-looking art - we even requisitioned one of my GMT counter trays to help organize the various counters. But it would have been good to have victory points more clearly indicated on all the bits and/or on the player mats.

I'm also not fond of the fiddly rules relating to the camp.

Components are good. The theme is well implemented in the need to resupply and tiles requiring varying levels of effort(action points). For these reasons alone the game gets a rating of 4.

The game is dull and pointless. The only player interaction is that you can follow the path of another player, potentially nabbing points they intended to get next turn. But, in general it is just blindly drawing tiles and hoping you draw one that can maximise your action points in winning tokens. No thought required, just random dumb chance.

Fun activity based game where players manage action points against limited time and resources in order to explore a cave system.

VPs are scored for taking photos, going into water for 'treasure', going deeper into the cave etc. At the end players also score extra VPs for having done the most of a certain activity. This is all balanced by need to expend food and not stretch out too thinly. Plays quickly and is good fun.

Components are a little small and fiddly though!

Várható volt, hogy az egyik legnagyobb csalódása lesz a 2012-es esseni játékoknak a The Cave és így is lett. A K2 alkotója jóval gyengébb játékkal rukkolt elő idén. Barlangász csapatot irányítunk, akik az egyes barlangi helyeken tokeneket gyűjtenek, amik különböző pontokat adnak a játék végén. A játék egyrészt nagy szerencsefaktorral bír, hisz nagyon nem mindegy, hogy üres járatokat fedezek fel vagy értékes pontokat hozó látványosságokat. Másrészt nagyon egysíkú a játék, felfedezek, megszerzem a tokent, hazamegyek ennivalóért és újra ugyanez. Egyedül talán a járatalakítás ad némi izgalmat, de ez nagyon kevés. Sima Tikalmechanizmus lopás az 5 akcióponttal gazdálkodás, sok újdonságot nem is tud felmutatni a játék. Családinak még elmenne, de sok akciópontszámítás miatt azért nehézkes lehet gyerekeknek vagy idősebbeknek. Az egyes tokenek pontjai csak a szabályfüzetben vannak leírva így követni is nehéz ki hány ponton áll. A tokenek megszerzéséhez magunk válogathatjuk össze a felszerelésünket, de mi alapján tegyük, hisz semmit nem tudunk előre. Szóval ez most több ponton vérzik, gyenge játék lett.

This is a push your luck set collecting game. You travel deeper and deeper into the cave collecting various items or accomplishments. The game never felt exciting despite a theme of cave exploration and the ending was anti climatic. For example in Ticket to Ride you can step back and admire the route you built, but here if completed one of the point scoring objects of taking a picture of an interesting cave feature all you got was a token. One thing I did like was the cave is create by laying out tiles, so each time it will be different.

I must say that while I was still annoyed by the rules ambiguities and general fiddlyness of the game, I like it much better than before.

Excellent Game; We love this game, it is a subtle thinking game, and we keep getting drawn back to it.

Although some have likened the cave to Carcassone, the only similarity is that it involves tile laying, besides that I don't see a comparison.  

The Cave requires a few plays to realize the tactics behind the game (don't they all). I disagree with the negative comments below, while there is some obvious randomness in the tiles you get, is that not the point? you are not supposed to know what comes next. Regarding the question of what can you plan for if you don't know whats coming, well the first few turns should be about finding out whats there, then returning to base, stocking up and then making the real expedition. Making wise Chooses as to where you pitch camp can be critical to maximize your action points usage. You must keep an eye on other players supplies;many times they have discovered some excellent opportunities to pick up scoring tokens just when they need to come back for resupply. Its then that you can race across to their tunnel and steal the glory. There is much more to the game than first meets the eye.

If I could some it up in one word, "Expedition". 
It involves: 

Equipment
Planning & Logistics
The unexpected
a sense of adventure and discovery  

I hope the designers will look to Polar exploration next

Well Done, more of the same please

RATING: 2
Random, and very boring. You discover a new tile if you can explore it, you do it, if not, you explore another tile. When someone is near you don`t want to discover a new tile, because you give someone other the chance to explore it.

Before the game you can choose your equipment, but how you should choose right? The tiles come random, so you can plan nothing.

The scoring is only in the rulebook, not on the markers, not on the player board/aid. That makes the first game very unconfortable.

I like hiking and scary movies about caves scare the crap out of me, so this game is a winner.  You can almost feel the walls of the cave closing in on you as you delve deeper underground trying to take pictures of rocks and scuba diving into completely safe pools of water.

It's not bad viewed as an experience game - exploring the cave is kind of fun. I would rate it somewhat higher on that basis except there's no way to really see anything massively different develop in later games.

It doesn't help that the camp doesn't seem worth using in most cases.

It's an tile-laying, resource management, Exploration game where the Caverns unfold as you discover them, but despite having a limited number of tiles, the specific way they are combined creates a unique subterranean experience each and every time.

I'll be the first to admit that it's not for everyone, you have to be detail-oriented to keep track of the relative depths of various cave sections. Also, this game is helped immeasurably by Plano storage for all of the tokens. 

The ever-expanding network of unique caverns coupled with the risk management as you push for bigger and bigger scoring opportunities as the clock is running out still really appeals to me.  Efficiency is the key!

This is one of our families favorites!

Possibly the most thematic game in my collection to date. Play is quite tight with a fair degree of crunch, however everything is logical and ties in to theme wonderfully. The rules aren't actually very difficult at all, but there's a necessity for players to establish discipline with their actions sooner rather than later. This is my current outright favourite, it's an excellent game.

Was so excited to play a relaxing game of non-fighting and fun exploration. Did not find it here. Turns got boring quickly. Title can be renamed as 'How to Pack Your Tent'

Explore a tile, collect a random VP chit (which doen't show its VP value), and repeat. Few decisions. Why not take any chit you can? A bit more complicated in the second half, due to the extra equipement juggle with the camp, but does't add much to the game.

Pretty light tile placing, as we achieve spelunking notoriety using set collection to manage our backpack in anticipation of the known and unknown obstacles and opportunities deep below.  Watch the movie Descent while you play this one.  It would be fun if there were also cave critters lurking but maybe that will be an expansion. 

Update: It is fiddly but still light fun when the mood strikes.

Traded away this one before I play it :(
I have half read the rules though, and it seemed that it wasn't our cup of tea!

Nice theme, simulations often don't make good games.

Simple set of rules in a game with loads of choices and no clear winning strategy. Excellent game, even though there's not a huge amount of variety in the tiles.

Muy interesante. Juego sencillito y familiar.

Better than I expected. It is not just purposeless tile flipping. There is a good amount of play in just managing your APs effectively.

Expected it to be a tense, risk-taking game. But it's more about calculating how to best use your actions, and maximize points. 
Tokens are pretty fiddly too.

This game is just dripping with theme! Want to cross water? Hope you brought your raft. Want to explore under water? That will use some of your air tanks. Want to squeeze through a tight spot? The tighter it is the more effort it takes. Such a great game, easy to teach as the theme really shows up and the mechanics are just background that make sense!

Es un juego entretenido para jugar con los amigos....con 4 jugadores es interesante, pero más de 2 horas de juego se hace pesado

Boring, boring game. No excitement at all for me.

Fast-paced, fun exploration and "trip"-planning game… with a lot of crawling back to base camp when you've planned poorly.  :laugh:  …and the graphics are gorgeous!

To less interaction and random tile laying.
Not Intresting. K2 is much better.

A tile laying game of exploration that does a really good job of making you feel like you're spelunking. It's a little too easy to miss how many actions you've taken (I resolved this by adding action tokens to keep track) and therefore REALLY balls up and be left without food, but it's a harmless little game playable within an hour. An easy recommendation from me.

I had the oportunity to try it during de "Festival Internacional de juegos de Córdoba" and it's really, really good. The mechanic is very intelligent, and the objetives give the oportunity to play it many times. Looking forward to play it again.

A lovely game. When you first look at the components it is hard to see the game. The draft for objects and objectives works, but lacks some drama in the 2 player game, I liked this draft better in the game C.O.G.. Very neat how open the play space is, that you can place planets, moons, asteroids, etc creatively to meet your objectives. Collisions are cool! In the end though I wasn't invested in the cosmos I was creating, quite nice but too passive for me.

Un eurogame facil de jugar, sin azar, aunque el manual cuesta leerlo.

Seems a nice idea and appeals very much to an amateur astronomer. :)

For me the game wins the "most surprisingly enjoyable game" title of Essen this year.
The rules are quite simple, but there is so much happening and the things you do are very novel (to me) that the game is simply fun!

Interesting ideas, fast gameplay, cool theme. The game itself is a bit clumsy when it comes to rules though, lacking the level of elegance I'd expect from a euro game.

Enjoyable light-medium game. Worker placement without a lot of tension. There is room for everybody. The trick is manage to get what you want from the options available at the moment.

Played only two times until now - need more plays. Original theme for every Science-Fan. Direct player interaction is low - more indirect via Worker Placement Actions on the Central Board, but it is subtle and tense. Simply put you combine smaller planets via the Collide Action into bigger planets, thereby fulfilling objectives which guide your creation into a certain direction plus there are several "bonus tiles" called exotic objects and you can "create life" by advancing counters on habitable planets. The game is straightforward, but nonetheless very interesting enough because of an exciting topic. Light to Mid-weight Euro-esque game. Will rate this finally after a few more games with more than 2 players. Until now at least a solid 8 for me. Interesting to see how this develops and if it stays tense for more games. Replayability is still in question. We'll see.

Very pretty game with an interesting theme but I didn't quite get it after one play. Hopefully future plays with make it clear how good this game is.

This is a quality game, but I think it's not for me. The others that I played it with all seemed to have a better time than I did. I find the theme to be somewhat alienating and cumbersome, even though I realize it will be a selling point for many. A bigger problem is that to a certain extent you  have your fate dictated by the scoring tiles that you draft. Yes, you have choice in drafting them, but you'll need to take some and once you have them your mission becomes clear. The few side scorings possible seem to hardly mitigate against this impression that you're chained to the path set by these tiles and opportunities to create synergies are limited. The many possible uses of asteroids adds some potential spark of clever play (at the cost of thematic but clunky rules complexity), but I found the game to be too prescribed overall.

This is a good game, but not one I need to own for 2 reasons: First I think replayability will noy-t be so good as it are always the same end of game or in-gme objectives then come available. But the main reason is that I think the game plays itself: if you have for instance an objective that asks for a gas planet with 2 level 2 moons, you will simply do all of your actions in function of that.
Therefore I don't need to own this game, but I'll be hapy to play someone else copy when he/she asks.

Extremely well connected theme with mechanics. An euro point collection, through and through, no player interaction at all, but the theme is just there and cannot be replaced.

Medium/light game with good component quality and focus on realism as far as we know (so no alien theme). I enjoyed it a lot since your a building a 'could-be' planetary system and the game does well in trying to be a realistic as possible in terms of science. The artwork is nice and we had a lot of exciting moments and combo turns. Replayability seems oke due to the random drafting of planets and objectives.

tl;dr: super cool concept!

In this game you get to crash asteroids into each other or planets to create/grow planets or moons. How fucking cool is that? And it puts this cool concept and puts it into a game that is both thematic, not overly complex and strategic!
At the core of the game is a worker placement mechanism. Each location has a couple of items of you to pick on a first-come basis. And you can only visit each location once per round. So this obviously leads to some nice turn angst and such.
I was really pleasantly surprised by this game. Going in I didn't really know what to expect and I didn't do particularly well, but I did really enjoy playing it.

Initial rating: 7.3/10
BGG scale: 7/10

The most megalomaniac theme I can think of in any game: Baby, U're a Star - and you want to make a great solar system for yourself. It scales well so I've enjoyed our two-player 30 minutes games as much as playing it with four. Mechanism-wise it's a simple drafting game where you place a pawn and pick a tile which you then place as part of your system or it determines what you'll score. What makes it fun is that you can smash celestial bodies into each other in your system to make bigger bodies, create an atmosphere or even life or add rings to your gas giants. I like the feeling you get of having created something at the end of the game. And it looks great on the table too.

Uno de los peores CDG que he jugado.
Tras un despliegue infernalmente complejo y largo me encuentro con un juego sin tensión en el que se producen situaciones absurdas en las que tus cartas no te sirven para nada. Muchas reglas para lo que luego es el juego, un asedio tras asedio que se alarga durante varios turnos. Habitualmente en cada escenario sobra la mitad del tablero y hay escasez de unidades para montar planes elaborados. 
Batallas muy sangrientas que dependen en un grado muy alto de la suerte.
Podría seguir, pero resumo todo lo dicho en una sola frase: será una gran simulación de las cruzadas, pero el juego no es divertido.
No comprendo el hype generado con el mismo ni voy a jugar ni un escenario más pq los dos que he jugado me han resultado soporíferos.
Eso sí, las cartas muy bonitas (por poner algo bueno).

After wetting my appetite with the old S & T game on the Crusades, looking forwrad to trying this.

Mar 2013- sat down to a 2 player 1st Crusade learning game. Suprisingly fluid play, with opportunities to mess with the other players plans thru card play. Will definately be playing further games to explore all the stratagems.

After a couple more plays (my records here seem to have missed a few) I've been losing steam with this game. Too complicated, too overchromed for a game that's really just about the sieges. The scenarios are generally uninteresting and feature one side that is hopelessly outgunned and just trying to hold on, maybe until their reinforcements show up and then their opponents become hopelessly outgunned. I really think it would have been better to pick just one (or maybe 2, 3 at the absolute outside) of these campaigns and make a focussed, interesting game instead of trying to make up in quantity what the game lacks in quality.

The physical presentation is a strangely mixed bag: the map, box, and card backs are quite nice while the counters, fonts, and card layout are total amateur hour, really horrendous.

---

Impressions after a couple games, of scenario A and B: There is a game here. It is vastly better than the other, recent Niel Randall-developed CDG misfires (Spartacus, Pursuit of Glory, God Kings). The card deck isn't huge so you get a rational flow to the events. It's an operational push-your-luck game, where you try to figure out if you have enough resources to do critical sieges in the allotted time, and push-your-luck is a good way to go. The card events seem nice, powerful enough to generate tension, give a feel for the period, and be entertaining, but not (generally) out of control (a few are pretty nasty).

Still, the period is what it is. This is not large armies going at each others' throats in high-stakes conflict as in Hannibal or Paths of Glory. This is a war of sieges and outposts, often with one side or the other playing strictly defense. There is nuance to it, you seem to have a good range of operational options to pursue, and crucially it plays fairly quickly, but it just doesn't have the drama of the great games in this genre. Still, I'm happy with a working game, which is more than we've been seeing of late.

Unfortunately, as with all Randall-developed games, I'm not sure how much actual development got done. There is still work that could have and should have been done to clean this sucker up and file off some more edges. It's not crazy complicated, but given that it's a game of siege, relief, and attrition, the design could have done more to concentrate on that and get rid of more fluff (the diplomatic advantage rules are an offender here). It's been said KoH is comparable in complexity to Wilderness War. It's not, but it should have been. It would have helped here if the player aids had been more inclusive: mustering limits, demobilization restrictions, requirements for major victories, and a diplomacy summary are major omissions that you will go hunting through the rules (no index) multiple times to figure out. I also wish we had gotten, say, 3 really well-developed and high-quality scenarios instead of 9 that are a mixed bag, some it seems with quite limited replay value.

Anyway, I don't want to sound too negative, because on balance I've enjoyed KoH and I think there is a game there that I will enjoy. At this point I rate it a solid 8. If you're a fan of Hannibal and enjoyed Wilderness War, it's definitely worth checking out. But it's not hard to wish that it had gone through more real development, it still feels a little  "loose", like there is slack in the system that could easily have been taken up.

I stand by my opinion that the graphic design on the counters and cards is atrocious (the board is fairly nice). Miserable font choices, unusable power icons, tiny card fonts, muddled color usage - it's a real mess, especially given this is just not a hard problem. It's attractive, sure, but some of it is borderline unplayable.
---
Played just scenario A - not much there, but OK for learning the game, and short. Seems like some really swingy cards. Still, potentially a lot to like.

Good grief though, the graphic design on the cards and counters is a massive, epic fail. Leader names are unreadable, important faction designations are not only tiny, but actually inconsistent, the card text is minuscule and scrunched up. It's really quite awful. Time to go back to the day job. The map, on the other hand, is rather nice.

Having read the rules, I have to say I'm deeply impressed by how sieges have been modeled as well as various other aspects of the game.

Given that my family name relates to the outstanding valour of a crusading ancestor of mine, this game particularly piqued my interest and I've looked forward to its publication ever since Scott opened a CSW folder dedicated to this design.

It could be a good game but I don't know until it is played against someone who has developed how it should be played.  It seems like a game where if Strongholds surrender then you can move fast. If not it bogs down into siege warfare.  This is historically correct but it remains to be seen it it works.

Very good game about Crusades era. Superb look, especially cards are beautiful. Interesting mechanics. Scenarios are not lenghty, very tense and fun. My "history-themed" opponenets lamented that rules about losses in combat are too severe as for middle ages battles historical result, suggesting home rules. 
But I have lots of fun playing KoH.

RATING: 8
An operational level CDG about a largely untreated period, with a few novel mechanisms, like army shadowing and battle avoidance. Quite flavorsome, but also a tad difficult to learn, due to the obtuse rulebook. Quite swingy and bloody, more of a storytelling/experience game than a deep strategic one. The chrome helps capture the feeling of the crusades well, especially in the way that sieges are resolved.

The components are quite nice, apart from the map which is neither paper nor mounted. The counters are nice but should have been easier to discern. Quite a bit of a learning curve on this one, although it is a simple game, so prepare to dive into the forums and for sure download the excellent player aid here on the geek. Plays reasonably well solo, for a CDG that is.

Quite enjoyable and neat. A keeper for me.

Rating: an '8' after reading the rules and doing a short solo game. Like it a lot. Fiddliness of the rules isn't that great. I do have some minor issues with the cards. The fonts used are sometimes hard to read and color-coding (regular event vs response) is not consistantly used.

RATING: 6
Rating after playing the first scenario and a couple partial plays of the 3rd Crusade. Seems like a decent game but, as others have said, seemed to lack tension and drama. A few of the cards seem especially heavy handed and potentially game changing. Still, it wasn't bad and I would play again, just to see how the other scenarios play if nothing else.

The game does revolve heavily around sieges and surrender rolls, which can lead to some stagnation. I'm concerned that a good surrender roll on an important city could be too swingy, and the system can be gamed a bit. I also feel like the cards are a little too significant in terms of determining the overall outcome. In Scenario D, for example, Saladin could fall ill the turn that Richard the Lionhearted and Barbarossa show up. May as well call it at that point.

Phsyically the map and counters look nice, though it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the Christian factions. Strangely, there are army counters provided to help with big stacks, but no army boxes on the map which has plenty of room for them. Annoyingly, the scenario book is not available online.

Waited for an age for this game to actually make it into print and by the time it did I was a little short on enthusiasm for it. The situation was not helped by finding that the scenario dealing with the First Crusade is just a training/learning scenario and that was the history I was most interested in visiting.

Three solo plays into it, it's just not quite working for me. It's an interesting subject, and a grand strategic scale, and it has several scenarios. Those are what made me want to play it, and are all big plusses. The scenario cards are a fantastic way to introduce special events into each scenario. But I find myself wishing the game were over well before it actually is, for several reasons.

There are many rounds where you just don't want to do anything at all, and just have to discard a card. You can't start another siege because it won't do anything, you don't want to attack anyone, none of the events are good...this is not a good gaming situation.

The sieges are so hard to actually get anything done, unless you get really lucky. So many turns consist of starting a siege, playing out all your events, and then going back home for the winter. It feels pointless. Huge point swings happen from random diplomacy rolls, or card flips.

The rules have about one level too much chrome for what ends up being a light random game of taking your chances on the sieges. The diplomacy advantage is really annoying, for just one example. The different nationalities, command, and so on. It could be reined in quite a bit.

Reader beware. I have not played this game. My opinion is based on others', expressed here, and my attempt at reading and setting up. Problems with fonts, tiny script, concepts of powers, vassals, stacking, sieges, and colors (not enough) all combining to give me a bad feeling about this game. When I have a bad instinct about a game, I am never agreeably disappointed.

Nice but the single pile of Cards for both player means that if you have the wrong Cards you cannot do much. Furthermore the sistem is too much attritional, VP awarded in too few location, so the strategy are restricted.

pre-order 19Dec07, received 29Jun12!

An initial high rating fell pretty quickly after two plays of the 3rd crusade.  The battle mechanic drives each side to 'alpha stacks' that tend stare at each other without attacking; too much chance for disaster.  The siege mechanic also gets old after awhile as it soon becomes clear that winning or losing a siege is purely dependent on the luck of the draw.  

There are also some very swingy cards, such as nasty siege effects AND a replacement card, epidemics, Saladin 'getting sick', etc.

The diplomacy mechanic, along with the diplomatic advantage adds very little to the game.

This is the only CDG I am aware of where you frequently decide that doing nothing is the best course of action.

While it could be okay for a quick F2F game where you don't take it too seriously, there are better games to play.

Hobby has been dying for a great strategic level design on the crusades for a LONG time. Been hearing some good very initial buzz on this title and managed to get this on the table for Labour Day. 

Had a good time; started with intro scenario and then played scenario D (which was a blast) - see my session report.

Some really interesting concepts: siege, shadowing enemy forces (great idea!) and a twist on interception (which really could use some new mechanics in our Card Driven Wargames). Also like the diplomatic component of the game, although we thought it could use some more granularity. And, the scenario list is damm impressive. Overall, clean system: accessible and easy to do what you want to do. Would have liked to see more chrome.

Components ok, although no key on map is an big unforced error with all that empty space. And, font on cards is tough to read. Not a fan of shared single deck games, but this one seems to work fine; we didn't stumble across any ridiculous killer cards that frequently plague single deck games. Good rules: had almost zero clarifications/questions. Counters are forgettable (which is a bummer and BIG lost opportunity given how flavor rich this conflict is) and somewhat difficult to tell apart (the various factions).

Bottom line? Will be playing KoH again soon and give it an initial big thumbs up.

Rating after one play...rating could go up. My session report here:

Kingdom of Heaven has attractively-designed components but the lack of clarity of the cards and counters detracts from their playability and the quality (a card map, thin cards, poorly die-cut counters) is not on a par with, for example, recent GMT offerings. The rulebook could be better: it is poorly laid out with some rules scattered across multiple sections, there are quite a large number of ambiguities, and some of the terminology is inconsistent. The issue of ambiguities and inconsistent terminology also applies to the cards.  

After a few plays (Scenarios A, B, C and J), I have a mixed opinion about this game. It does reflect well the warfare of the Crusades. Also some of the game mechanics, especially the handling of sieges, are novel and interesting. The emphasis on siege warfare and the important influence of diplomacy results in a very different game to Hannibal (which KoH is loosely based on) and many other games in the CDG genre. 

On the other hand, Kingdom of Heaven provides far less tension and drama than the best CDG games. Often the decision on how to play a card is trivial - maybe the event is useless for you or cannot be played, and the siege event is the wrong type (generally in a given turn you are either attacking or defending in sieges and most siege events or only playable by either the attacker or defender) or would have no effect. That usually just leaves the option of using the card to move units. Sometimes even this option cannot be utilised, in which case you can only discard the card.

Compared to other games, Kingdom of Heaven focuses less on battles - which occur relatively infrequently - and more on drawn-out sieges of cities. Although the sieges are handled in an interesting way, they are subject not only to the chance of dice rolls but also to the chance of the card draw - lack of cards with suitable siege events makes attacking all but the weakest targets difficult, which is perhaps why the Fortunes of War mechanic (more randomness) was introduced. Two other areas that the game focuses on are castles and attrition. The mechanics for both of these may add historical accuracy, but they are unneccesarily fiddly, thus detracting from game play.

I'm not sure when I'm going to get a play in. Now seeing the physical production up close, the font choices for the card titles and the counters are pretty disastrous in terms of usability. They looked stunning on the computer screen in the teasers all those years (!!) ago. 

Nonetheless, I'm hopeful that there's a good game in here at the right complexity for me (maybe akin to Wilderness War or a notch below Paths of Glory). The number of scenarios is a slight concern--with a whopping *nine* of them, I have doubts that all of them have been sufficiently playtested or can sustain interest.

Ι have read the rules, its an interesting game about an era that i love to read in history books. I was dissapointed because in the rulebook there is no mention regarding the predecessors (AH's: [thing=234]Hannibal [/thing] and [thing=68][/thing]) because all rules regarding the army movements/battles/inteception/avoiding/naval movement etc were taken from there. There are many new rules though such us the shadowing, sieges, captive leaders, diplomacy, army attrition and more, that are very well implemented. The card driven system also reminds me [thing=12333][/thing] because of the cards that are removed if they are played as events, the shuffling of the deck etc.
I must play this because its interesting and i m waiting for the 4th crusade expansion.

Very thematic, very elegant rules. There's only one problem: Sieges. In this game you can't assault a castle right from the start - you even can't when you have an army worth 40 points and the enemy only 6 points. Yes, you are reading it right. Because each city or castle has a horrible resistance factor your army's value is only at about one fourth or fifth of the real strength. AND the besieged one get's a roll bonus, the besieger not. So you are VERY dependent on draw luck and need the right cards to lower the resistance factor. And most times you don't get enough right cards and when you don't have again luck with the dice... Well, the rules are meant good to show the horror of a siege, but they are TOO hard and in that way as unrealistic as rules that ignore sieges. A pity :(

Strange experience with this game. I felt a bit lost at the begining, I didn't know how to use castles. Well, first time were difficult as I didn't know how to make a strategy. Maybe because I'm not used to medieval wargames.
But once I grabbed the system, well, it's really fun! It's all about attrition and to look for a decisive battle after reducing as much as possible the other player's army by making it crossing poor terrain, friendly strongholds and for the Muslim player, by shadowing. 
Sieges rules in this game are great too.
I didn't play all the scenarios yet. Until now, the best one is the Third Crusade. Just for this one, I rate it an 8. Rating might go up if the last scenarios are as great as this one.
Components are very good, especially the cards and the map (Columbia cardstock type).

This is my favorite type of game.  Plenty of opportunity for maneuvering and grand strategy.  Enough luck to lay waste to the best of plans.  Interesting choices to make each turn on the map and card managment. I like the extra use of cards for siege events, in addition to usual events or activation of leaders.  Lots of different scenarios which offer both historical and game play choices.

Two player CDG covering the crusades and Mongol invasions of the Middle East. Player have to manoeuvre their forces across the board and control VP spaces for victory, Jerusalem being high on the list, as least for the first half of the scenarios. The siege system is intricate with each card having a special siege event in addition to a normal event, leading to the increase and reduction of column shifts should the besieger attempt an assault. Battles can be quite bloody and become rarer for experienced players less willing to stake all on the roll of a die.

Easy to play. Simple, yet nuanced. This is one of the best card-driven games I've ever played and you get your money's worth with all the crusades it covers - even the Mongols.

I would rate the mechanisms a "9"(some roughness in some cases) and the rules a "8"(unclear or missing clarifications of rare situations), but the enjoyment you get off this game is off the charts. Truly amazing historical representation.

Zwei-Spieler-Spiel, das auf operativer Ebene und in neun unterschiedlich komplexen Szenarien die Kämpfe um die Kreuzfahrerstaaten insb. während der ersten drei Kreuzzüge simuliert. Angetrieben wird das Game von einem – je nach Szenario – unterschiedlichen Kartendeck (das ‚Grunddeck‘ wird um Szenario-Karten erweitert). Vorzüge (neben dem nicht allzu verbrauchten Szenario): Man lernt (u.a. qua Karten) wirklich etwas über die Kreuzzüge und die kurzlebigen Kreuzfahrerstaaten. Eine relativ geringe Counterdichte ermöglicht raschen Überblick. Gut formulierte, nicht übermäßig umfangreiche Regeln (ca. 30 Seiten – aber üppig illustriert). Abgesehen von drei Szenarien spielt sich der Rest in unter drei Stunden.

Lots of historical flavor. The ergonomics (rules, cards, counters) could be better. Download the user-made rules digest from BGG; I found it a big help.

You probably won't like this game if you prefer slam-bang action. Battle is extremely risky, as it was in the period. Most of the action is in maneuver and sieges. Fortunately, every card has a siege event. They provide the narrative and the "illusion of movement" of what would otherwise be a dull game mechanic. The siege events are what sold me on this game.

18 months after clearing P500, I got tired of waiting and canceled both copies.  I'll have a look if it ever publishes.

I've lost faith in MMP.  Their products are excellent, but they don't seem to be able to execute, and that's death for a wargame publisher.

This is one of my biggest disappointments, I really wanted to like this game.  For the time it took to be released you'd think MMP would have put more effort in a better product.  The rules are a mess and there are constant questions about interpretation during game-play.  Then the card text, is there a font that is more unreadable?

Enough of the production, the game-play is where I was disappointed the most.  Overall just a boring game, too many cards that were useless because the OP's value was too low to activate any leaders.  Then bland events that largely did not apply.  The game revolved around siege success and it was as difficult as ASL to remember all the modifiers which in the end became a dice game.

Excellent CDG which models the Crusader conflicts well. Comes with nine scenarios each with unique cards; there's a lot of game in the package. The first scenario alone is very replayable trying to get the Crusaders to win. The siege subgame is brilliantly done with each card have a siege section. Very appropriate to the conflict.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] This sounds very good, and the play time and complexity are right for getting it to the table sooner rather than later, too.

RATING: 8
Middle-weight war game that gets the card driven element quite right. Not really for the casual (war)gamer, if such a thing even exists, but not presenting those awful excruciating decisions every round. 

The theme holds only that much interest to me, as situations seem to be more tactical than strategic, but that's just me, not a flaw per se.

L'ambiance des croisades et la guerre de siège et de harcèlement sont bien simulées. C'est mon seul CDG mais il semble que les meilleurs proposent une tension et un choix cornélien du jeu de carte qu'en effet KoH ne propose pas, les options stratégiques n'étant pas si nombreuses que cela. De nombreux scénarios qui permettent de bien voir l'évolution de la situation.

Great game about the Medieval era & the battles between Christians & Muslims!!!But i think that there's a terrible missed in the game by the fact that the 4th Crusade(1204)is not included ,even it takes place inside the ages of the game(1097-1291)!!I'm surely waiting for an errata or expansion by MMP...& obviously correct this mistake!Only in that case we can tell that the game becomes complete!!!
 After that we can say that we'll have one of the best Medieval warfare games we'ever seen.....An all time classic title indeed...

Thoroughly enjoying this game. A wonderful, smart and engaging treatment of the Crusades. It replicates so many facets of the conflicts, from feudal squabbling, cavalry raids, shifting allegiances and the tension of sieges. You get a lot of stuff in one box, and the scenarios (which include one "what if?" setup) are pretty replayable. It furthermore adds a few twists to the usual playing rhythm of "I go, you go" card-driven strategy games, and it works wonder. Heartily recommended.

I especially like the siege rules, which is a real mini-game and has a narrative quality of his own.

The variety of the scenarios guarantees a lot of replayability.

Kingdom of Heaven m'apparaît comme un système très bien pensé pour son contexte et pour les campagnes médiévales en général. Il rend bien la difficulté de rassembler son armée et le fait qu'elle n'a que quelque mois avant de devoir être démobilisée en grande partie. J'aime aussi particulièrement le rendu des sièges. D'habitude, un jeu stratégique se contente d'un jet de dé, avec des modificateurs, pour voir si la ville tombe. Ici, pas du tout. On peut tenter d'affamer les habitants, chaque carte possède des événements de siège qu'on peut jouer pour affaiblir (ou renforcer) les défenses de la ville, la chance peut intervenir en dernier recours, etc... C'est réellement un jeu dans le jeu, avec un aspect narratif très agréable. A réessayer de toute urgence, en particulier vu la variété des scenarios proposés

Played it at last!!

Two games so far of the learning scenario - 1st crusade.

The game plays well after the rules are bedded down.  The game system seems to recreate the struggle of the crusades very well indeed (so far).  I like the fact that the sieges are by no means easy and quickly managed (unless the enemy are utterly unprepared).

Look forward to seeing the other scenarios.

This game is my first CDG game. Not being a fan of (card games), I find this game very interesting and surprisingly immersive. The siege (card-based) mechanisms match (in duration) sieges in that era. The mobilization/demobilization technique matches historically (at least with moslems)how armies were seasonal affairs. Finally the leadership ratings which impact movement actually match the historical turn of events (Kerbogas "slow" attempt to raise the siege of Antioch). A very nice design and a treasure of a game.

I played two games of this. A little disappointing as it seems to take too long and too hard to take any city or stronghold in this game. Hopefully we were doing something wrong but until I see a way to correct this I can'tgive it very high marks.

Played first, third and fifth Crusade.

The good:
@ Fantastic setting
@ Fantastic map
@ Fairly simple rules
@ Lots of flavour
@ CDG
@ Good gameplay
@ High replayability

The bad:
@ Minor: Text on cards is hard to read
@ Christian factions could have used a more diverse set of colours for the counters.   
@ The First crusade was just a training scenario and should be considered a such.

Crusader Rex is another Crusades game that I just have to recommend, one of my few 10:s.

Nice looking board and components.  Rules reasonably easy to understand, but you end up doing a fair amount of referencing.  Lots of scenarios that cover all the crusades.  
However, there were a few aspects of the game that limited the amount of meaningful decisions, tensions, or just slowed down the game:
1) Ignoring all the fixed castles and token garrisons to protect walled cities, you end up with only 1-2 dozen units that are actually in play.  This means you really are only active in 1-3 locations.
2) You really have no chance of conducting a successful siege without knocking down the stronghold's resistance factor.  That is very dependent on drawing the right siege event cards at the right time.  If you draw a bunch of defense ones or those that you can't play, you basically sit there waiting for the next turn.
3) Unlike some games where you can do several things with a card, you typically can only use a card for the event or moving (diplomacy cards are uncommon).  If your leaders are stuck conducting sieges or being besieged, you can end up with cards that are not of much use.
4)  While there are lots of castles scattered around the map, the only locations that are important are the victory point locations.  All of the other castles have little use other than helping or worsening attrition.

Have to play more of it (and on different sides too), to get a better feeling of the game. 
Having played only the first scenario as a Muslim side, the game seemed too slow and lacking action and choices. 

Must say, that we also misplayed some rules, which affects my judgement. 
Must force myself to play an advanced scenario with diplomacy and naval movement to give the game a more objective rating.

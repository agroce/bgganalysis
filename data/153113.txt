Initial thoughts

Pros:
I loved playing Speedball 2 growing up and this game really captures the theme. Turns are fast. It has great components. 4 full teams in the base game. Can be as simple (Scrimmage) or complex (League) as you want. Can play 2,3 or 4 players. Doesn't take itself seriously. Dependent on player numbers, matches can finish in under an hour (unlike similar sports games such as Bloodbowl which can take 2-2.5 hours). The stands/bases of the miniatures make it clear what type of player the miniature represents (an improvement over Dreadball where for some teams it is not always clear if a miniature is Blocker, Jack or Striker).

Cons:
It feels like 6 turns is not enough in a two player game. 8 turns would be better. The "lore" is a bit weak compared with more establish game universes like Bloodbowl and Dreadball. The expansion teams are currently way over priced and difficult to get hold of in the UK. The miniatures are generally good but are made of soft plastic and will require hot water treatment to straighten some of the stands/bases out. 

N.B. 
Might possibly be a Dreadball killer, but Blood Bowl is safe for now.

Very scalable: you can play Skirmish mode with casual/non-gamers and kick it up to Exhibition & League for more depth.
Supporting more than two players also makes it easier for newer, less confident players to get started. I suppose it feels less like an invitation to a kicking...

RATING: 7.5
just plain a lot of fun.

Minor criticism: I do find it hard to tell the sculpts within a team apart sometimes.  The bases are coded by shape, plus there is some correlation between the stats/role and the sculpt.

Fun multiplayer game.  Scalable rules are a plus, but the game gets much better with Exhibition/League play.  Four teams of unique Minatures. The Minatures themselves are excellent, with keyed bases to make identification simple.  However extra teams, and arenas are VERY expensive, but not required.

Fantastic fun! Gotta get all the teams and arenas. 
I may even need the team dice and bags....

This game is encapsulated in the name: brutal savagery under the auspices of a scoring sports game.  You can get points through shooting goals or through beating down the opposition.  Scrimmage play puts everyone on equal footing and is a good way to learn the basics. Each team has a unique stat line and extra rule set when played with the Exhibition rules.  League play introduces support staff and individual player advancement.  

The components are stellar, with the athlete pieces paramount.  They are a larger scale than most minis games, so the awesome sculpts are very detailed and easy to differentiate.  The arenas are HUGE and look great on the table.  The player boards have excellent art for all four athlete positions, showcasing each team's aesthetic.

Slaughterball will draw comparisons to its predecessors, notably Blood Bowl.  While Slaughterball owes a lot to that old game, it also leaves it in the dust, in my opinion.  Slaughterball has a similar vibe, but it plays faster, has more variation and sci-fi always trumps fantasy in my book.  If these sorts of games interest you, find a way to give this one a try.

This game seems like it should be better than it is. I've only played twice, both scrimmage games. The first time was very bad. Way too much downtime between turns. Still there was a kernel of fun in there somewhere, so I didn't want to give up on it. The second time I tried it, I houseruled it so there was less time between player turns and all agreed it helped but no one wanted to play it again. I need to try an exhibition game to see if that helps. Sad really, I was very excited for this one.

As a former 'light' game player and current play-tester of Slaughterball I think I can give you a unique perspective.
I love games and am always up to play anything but usually played the standard retail-type stuff. I had NEVER played a game with hex-boards, dice checks, minis, etc. Until this game. We started fairly regular game nights and usually started each night play-testing Slaughterball.
As a newcomer to the genre these kinds of games have a steep learning curve for me but I'm catching on with help from this game. Heck, I've even been able to hammer out a few wins :) We've had quick, light plays and we've had longer, brutal games. Each team has its specialties but, in the end, any team can win. The games are always balanced and close.
Its been cool to watch the game grow from prototype with hand drawn and borrowed parts to the really nice pieces shown in the campaign. I can only imagine how the final pieces turn out.
Bottom line is that I have a blast playing and I've pledged at the top level. Can't wait to have it on my table!

Fun game, but difficult to learn since the rules and summary sheet tend to over explain.

This game isn't for me since I'm generally not a fan of miniatures, sports or sci-fi themes. I neither enjoyed the chaotic nature of play nor preponderance of dice used for skill checks. On the plus side the minis were impressive for their detail, especially considering their small size.

Slaughterball does a superb job of capturing the distinctive feel and excitement of an actual sporting event--a fantastical, futuristic, super-violent sporting event featuring genetically enhanced athletes that you, the player, get to coach. 

I'm far too busy and clumsy-handed to be painting miniatures, but my desire to personalize this extremely fun and highly immersive game has proved too great to resist.

Where would I rank Slaughterball amongst other games of its type?

1. Slaughterball
2. Blood Bowl
3. Dreadball
4. Kaosball
5. Battle Ball

Yes. It's that great. 

Now whip your team into shape, and meet me in the arena!

If I liked this sort of game I would be all over this one, it really seems to offer some great options from the number of players, to the variable playing piece/team abilities, and the different ways to score. I would definitely consider getting this one for my sister.

This game was solid and worth the weight.  We only played with two, so parts of the field we rather empty at times, but the game has solid action and mechanisms.

RATING: 9.5
Outstanding game! Three versions of play in the same game suitable for all styles of players. Scrimmage for balanced play with lite on the rules, Exhibition for added strategy and tactical play as each team and athletes are given different stats and abilities, and league play for building and crafting your team over a series of games. One of the best rulebooks that I have read with the league rules rising to the top! 

Four complete teams included with enough athletes to field any combination in league play. An additional four teams will be released shortly with another eight currently being play tested against the first eight to insure balance and avoid the "power creep". Every team will also be receiving their own "home field" advantage board with added game mechanics during play. Unlimited options for replay ablilty. 

I understand that Slaughterball has been in development for over four years, before there was a resurgence of fantasy/sci fi sports games. They have had the time to get it right and it shows.

40+ Plays - Such a fantastic sports game. Fast, action-packed and visually/ imaginatively wonderful. Inspired by the old console game from the late 80s early 90s: 'Speedball'. Score points by beating people up OR shooting goals. The base rules are more than enough to have a lot of fun, and have a pretty easy learning curve for a miniature game. There are of course, more advanced rules for the creatively themed teams. Games can be quite quick, after only a few games under your belt, meaning you could host a 'mini-season' in a night. Utilising the strategy cards that you draw to their best effect, as well as your team's strengths (with the advanced rules) are important. 
---
Criticisms usually revolve around two issues: 1. The game can devolve into a fist fight 2. It's very hard to re-enter your players to the pitch after they've been injured. Firstly, winning through brutality is really about the long game of denying your opponent 'point-scoring opportunities' by taking their players off the field. Clever players know however, that shooting wins games. Avoiding that juicy brawl often means scoring more points. Secondly, yes! Having players injured is really bad! Some teams will gain injuries quicker than others due to their lack of resilience, and thus need to take early leads utilising their shooting prowess.

I played a demo of this board game last week with Erik Kjerland. The scrimmage version was surprisingly fun. It's a well-balanced dice and strategy game where you can rack up just as many points injuring people as making goals.

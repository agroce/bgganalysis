[I]tl;dr - An unpolished diamond is still unpolished -- and this one would never realistically get played in my group. Depends on having fans of the books around.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

The Dice Must Flow is a solid game, but it has a few too many flaws for me to keep permanently, I think. I really wanted to love it, and the game really is great for Dune fans, but it's not a strong enough game to stand for people who aren't Dune fans. When you're the only fan at the table, it's a generic area control game and all the strong theme is lost. Unfortunately, this is the biggest strike against it staying in my collection, and it's not even the game's fault. I just wish I knew more Dune fans

It's very hard to recruit troops, making area control on the map a bit of a crapfest in our view. We thought of a few variants to mitigate this but nothing that would help quite enough, I don't think. If you could recruit more troops and move more easily, I think this game would hit a new level, but as it is it is a beautiful game with a lot of potential. 

Recommended, if you're a die-hard Dune fan with others to play with. I sold this game after only a single play because I knew it wouldn't hit the table, but with the right group (hardcore dune fans), this one could go really well. It's a shame, because negotiation is something I love, but this one is just too dependent on the right atmosphere to stick in my collection.

I've also heard that Heiko updated the game to a v2, which I'd really like to try.

Great game.   I love the player interaction with forming an ally, but always looking to an opportune time to switch or go solo.  Graphics are nice, my group and I love the simple but genius battle mechanic. Over in an hour so you can get multiple games in, one of my tops games now.  I would only play it with 4-6.  No way with 2, 3 doesn't have allying which is the best part.  7 to 8 is just a mess, a few guys will never play it again after their first 7 player which took 3 hours.  It was painful.

It does what it sets out to accomplish, which is to boil Dune/Rex down to its base elements and play in a comparatively short amount of time.  However, while there is some element of strategy in choosing which dice you keep and which you re-roll, it lacks any decent method of mitigating your rolls as most modern dice games do.  Outside of a few blocking elements like the snooper, the shield, or the thumper, you are left in the hands of fate - which is to be expected in a dice game, of course.  However, just a few little bits to allow you to manipulate at least some of the outcome rather than simply defend against it would push this up to a 7.

As a result, the game lacks the tension of its inspiration, but it is by no means un-fun.  It's actually quite an admirable effort in turning Dune into a fun dice game, but for me personally, the tension and strategy is what draws me to the original.  In this game, as I said before, the dice results take away a lot of that tension, and it seems alliances don't really offer that much; sure, you can share your powers and share your victory, but the overall weak bond of the alliance itself (it lasts only for your turn) also poorly incentivizes doing it unless it's going to position you for a shared victory that turn.

All that being said, the game has a fantastic visual design to it and I'm glad I got the chance to play it.  I wouldn't go make my own version of it, but in the end, as previously mentioned, it does what it sets out to do - you can get a good Dune-ish game busted out in about an hour or two and there are no complaints on that end.

This isn't normally the type of game I'd like, but it's so well constructed, and so focused on what it does (which involves backstabbing and betrayal) that I enjoyed it.

RATING: 3
Really not a lot here. A pretty random dice game slapped together with an area control game that is too random to set up properly. In my one play, the other players spent just as much time on how to improve the game as they did playing it. I would rather play something else.

If this is "stripped-down Dune," then I have another game I never have to bother to play.

As one of the few print and plays I have played it was pretty good. The time of the game is much more manageable than its big brother. I like the mechanics and artwork but the rules are a somewhat confusing in some places and I don't get the sense of betrayal as much as it's big brother. (which is what dune is all about) I think this game looses a lot at 2 or 3 players and I wouldn't recommend that.  Finally I would have like to have seen this follow the story of the books and not be an alternative time line. Dune for me did a great job of that. 

Without comparing this to the dune game or the books. It's a solid game that I enjoyed.

PnP version of "Dune: The Dice Game", which was re-titled to "The Dice Must Flow".

Glad I grabbed a nice PnP copy when I did, since it is apparently no longer available due to the Herbert estate putting the kibosh on everyone's fun.

RATING: 6
Possibly made a mistake in using some of the wonkier factions for a first game, which resulted in a game without much combat or alliance, but this felt like a decent enough condensation of the original boardgame. The alliance mechanic seemed particular neat, and having your attack target as one of the rerollable dice is a small piece of genius.

PnP - Built April 3, 2015.

Pretty good. Feels very much like the original Dune without being crazy long. Maybe longer than strictly necessary, and of course you are more subject to luck. It would be crazy to play this with 8, but the fact that it can is rather interesting. Really depends a lot on the group I would think. All in all, I think the goal of creating something in-between Dune Express and Dune has been achieved.

I was really looking forward to trying this one out and it disappointed slightly. I love the look of the game, not sure I love the dice. I'm also not sure it saves a lot of time. I guess if I couldn't have access to Dune or Rex, then I'd pull this one out, but the original is better and not much longer in my experience.

This is not Dune in complexity, mechanics or strategy but this is a good game. There is enough strategy and competition to interest a gamer but simple enough to include a novice player.

This is only the second PnP game that I have found worthy of actual publication. It is unfortunate that the Herbert family will never allow this.

We played "Dune the Dice Game" twice, not to be confused with "Dune Express". Some people in the group hated it because the die luck was too rough for their tastes. Other players didn't really understand the concept of how one plays a player negotiation game. They just played 'punch the perceived leader' with resulted in the player who's ability was that they win if nobody wins, to win... which actually meant that the player who guesses who will win and if they guess right, then THEY win, to win. I feel like these player negotiation games SHOULD work, but they never seem to with my group.

The dice play is a little wonky, as with all Yahtzee-type games, but it's bearable as a facilitator and delivery mechanism of ALLIANCES. Seems to capture the feel of long Dune with that plus the dervish of powers flying around. Takes up to 8, but downtime can get steamy (though not that bad as you can jockey for alliances on other people's turns).

I love that even if you try to commit to an alliance, it is still ephemeral due to the whims of the dice. All alliances are temporary in Dune and shift with the times, whether you like it or not; stay flexible.

4+4

RATING: 7
Dune-light, with dice.  Works well with 4+ players.  Plays much faster than the AH original (which is excellent but typically requires at least half a day to play with 4+). Alliance maneuvering is a critical component of the game, to prevent it from dragging (a win by a single player is difficult)... and combat is deterministic, like the original.  Those not captured by / familiar with the theme (Frank Herbert's Dune, and the background to the various factions) may not enjoy the game as much / not get into the alliance making and breaking.

[3.9.17] Just ran across a geek auction for a nicely crafted copy. I'm tempted, even if it ran $50. However, many people are calling this slow, and I'm ignoring the jackhat that called it the worst game ever after their first turn took over an hour. If this were a svelte and speedy Dune experience, I'm all over it. But the 10 turn variant makes the original playable. Do that instead.

I wanted to love this game. Beautiful presentation, wonderful theme.

The unpredictable luck-mitigation however leads to the game randomly screwing you over, too often for my taste (somebody on the forums calculated 32%...)

The completely deterministic combat makes a turn (after the rolls) completely "solvable", which makes my alpha tendencies surface. See how Kemet did the combat, this did the same, but not well.

A good game with a lot of downsides that really bring down the rating. Downtime issues with many players, I guess you need to be geared toward Diplomacy type games for this to work, our group is geared toward anything else. Also the game itself drags on for too long, had it gone the full 6 rounds at the pace we were going it would have been 3 hours, luckily it ended in round 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an attempt to bring the feeling of the classic Dune game into a modern dice game. For the most part, it works great. Everything is set-up to mimic the same sort of decisions required in the classic game. When to find an ally, when to attack and with how many troops. It's all here,

The only things I don't care for are the randomly determined invasion points. It doesn't matter if you a spot a hole in your opponent's defenses, if you can't roll that region number, you can never engage and take advantage of that situation. I know it's a dice game, but it is a little strange to determine military targets completely at random. Same with the alliance system. You can only form an alliance with a faction, if you roll that faction on the dice. Again, it seems kind of odd to have a dice mechanic determine effective use of diplomacy.

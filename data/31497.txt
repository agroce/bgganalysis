The mechanic of this game utterly irritates me.  The cards dictate where you can play and the player to your left exploits anything you are setting up.  It becomes a game of playing your worst and the player who cannot play the worst sets the next player up for victory.  I really wanted to like this game.

Traded.

Has the most ridiculous back of game copy I've ever read--

"We write of the year 1846. Gunslingers, lawmen, pioneers and whole families left their homes in the east and mid-west to try their luck in the West. They loaded their covered wagons with all they could and headed west across steppes, deserts, and mountains. Many chose to settle in Oregon, where the farming and hunting was plentiful and they could stake out a bit of land for themselves. 

The players have already reached Oregon and gaze upon the rich farmland below and the potential gold and coal reserves of the mountains. They build ports on the lakes and rivers, churches, warehouses, post offices, and train stations on the plains. And, of course, they must farm the rich land to grow the food necessary for the area to grow and thrive.

To win, a player must choose the right times to farm and the right times to build, for planning is necessary even here in the untamed wilderness of Oregon!" 

I love how it goes from gunslingers and lawmen and heading west across deserts and mountains to building post offices and choosing the right times to farm. It's like they skipped the exciting part and built a game around the boring...

This game is pretty light, but it's perfect for what I was looking for: fun and relaxing.  It's engaging enough to not be brain dead or totally luck driven, but simple enough to be relaxing.  It plays quickly and has great art and components.  Definitely fits nicely in the super filler category.

Very nice game, with lots of decisions and the inclusion of the extra turn and joker tiles is inspired. Also loved the two ways of scoring that kept everyone invloved throughout.

RATING: 6.5
We're in Carcassonne level of complexity here, but arguably a more interesting game. Lots of routes to victory points, plenty of interesting decisions and a good dose of luck are all involved. Easy to learn (and teach) and non-gamer friendly. This was a real bargain at £7.99 in the Works. (And the cowboy meeples are great - I've repainted mine for use in my "enhanced" copy of Walnut Grove!)

After a few fun games, I bought a second copy. Now with my repainted meeples and a few new tokens I can play with up to 6 players. (8 might be pushing it...)

Juego familiar bastante táctico, buscando la mejor opción con las cartas que te han tocado. Quizás es excesivamente azaroso en ese sentido porque es muy determinante este azar, quizás mejoraría adaptándolo para suavizar ese azar. Diferentes opciones de puntuación y tácticas de recuperar turno extra o comodín muy bien implementados. Componentes bastante buenos, los vaqueros están genial y lo bueno es que escala perfectamente tanto para 2, 3 o 4 jugadores.

Light and relaxing. The luck factor is quite a thing in this game but there's still some room for little tactics. Not bad but not great either.

Oregon is one of those games, in which your (meaningful) choices are rather limited and you just do whatever you can. Of course, you have some decisions to make but sometimes you simply do not get the right cards. This is not always a bad thing but you just have keep it in mind and not take the game too seriously.

The most negative aspect of the game is the mechanic how you use the cards. Even with only four cards in your hand, it can be very difficult and time consuming to figure out the options you have. Nevertheless, the game works and I do not see any obvious design flaws in it. On the other hand, I cannot find any particular highlights either.

Reasonally simple and quick and also quite attractive to look at.  The game play is thoughtful rather than brain-burning for the most part, but at the start there is a good deal more luck - it's harder to mitigate against drawing tiles that you don't want.  The power of the Joker and extra-turn chits can be quite high if you can tap into them on a loop.

An enjoyable game with a good mixture of strategy and luck. Stays close and exciting to the very end. The moving system is quite unique.
From a game named "Oregon" I would have expected something that was a little more region or history specific. But this game has neither a map of Oregon (no Pacific coast, no mountain ranges) nor is it about the Oregon trail. Instead, you need to settle on a quite generic map.

RATING: 7
A fun game of tile and meeple placement.  Strategy is constrained by hand limit and cards in hand.  Very fun, and very different from Carc, but beware of playing this with the AP-inclined.  (From additional plays, I'm liking this one more and more.  Very glad I own it.)

EDIT:  I should rate this higher since it plays well, is easy to learn, is fun, and has a nice mix of euro-abstract overlay.  Why not higher then?  Because the strategy side isn't very deep and the cards drive everything.  There are combos to be made, but your cards will push-pull on all you do.  Which is good and bad.

We liked it ok, sort of, mostly -- the mine tiles are a little too random, and there are some other issues (basically, the game's a little rough around the edges) but it seems tolerable.  Not sure I'd ever play it over Carcassonne, though, since the gridding is simply a bit annoying.

What makes the game unique is what makes the game annoying: The mechanism to place your pawns is simple in theory, but difficult to execute quickly. This makes the game more difficult than it needs to be, and that makes the experience less than ideal.

RATING: 7
Nice lighter family type tile placement game sort of along the lines of Carcassonne but certainly different enough that the two are more distant cousins than brothers. The card element dictating tile and farmer placement combined with the joker and 2nd turn tiles allows for some interesting turns so the mechanics allow for some clever plays. The game moves along fairly well although turns can take longer especially later in the game as the players check through all their possible placement options.

There's nothing really wrong with Oregon. Play some cards to place a tile or cowboys to get some points. It's perfectly playable, but it's a little by the numbers ordinary. 

The most interesting feature is probably how your two special abilities mitigate bad card draws in order to make play more interesting while two of the buildings re-activate used abilities rather than score points. Nevertheless, abusing the special abilities and those two buildings seemed easy enough to nearly be trivial.

leading contender for my current list of "should be a play-by-web game".  takes a little longer to learn and/or explain than is probably worth it, and the opportunity to reward players for minmaxing, and the mechanics themselves are prone to their own sort of AP because of the grid location system.  pre-planning is possible, but if your spot gets taken you're back to square one.  AP also escalates as the game gets more populated, a feature i tend to dislike in games.  that being said, i'd probably play it regularly by web and see it as a fun solo-with-friends optimization puzzle.

This game borders between filler and super-filler.  This is true both on the challenge level and the length of play side.  Super easy to teach and fairly approachable to many, the game is a nice transition from light games to more substantial euros.  It could easily be used as a gateway game, but likely not as the first exposure.

I like playing this game better than expected; seems very luck-driven at first glance, but the joker allows for quite a lot of compensation to that. Plays pretty swiftly, which is a major plus. Not a "great game" by any measure, but interesting enough for variety every once in a while.

RATING: 7
Game was very tight until I managed to get a high-scoring church on the last round.  There is a constant pain of not having the right cards,  but there is always something to do,  so it's not catastrophic.  And maybe that's why the game doesn't rise above the plain for me - there are interesting choices to maximise your score,  but generally there is no point in looking ahead even one turn - any good spots are likely to have gone by the time your turn comes around again.  So it is very reactive. Good,  but not great.

RATING: 8
Nice game, but still not sure how good it really is. Would like to play it with more than two.

Played a three-person-game, not that different. Still - it's at good game. I think it is difficult to plan ahead, when you only have four cards, but that makes it a light game - in a good way.

Those Jokers are sure important!  The 2nd turn marker is really powerful as well... maybe too powerful?  Makes for some interesting strategy, when you can use your 2nd turn to make a move that gives you that 2nd turn marker back (though obviously you can't use it right away).

This is a quick and light family game. Because of this the randomness is just bearable. There are some clever mechanics in this design and you can control your own destiny up to a certain point. But with experienced players, the one who gets the best cards will just win. Not my cup of tea.

Played a bit more with two players. This reduces the luck factor considerably and the game feels much more controllable.

Is a one word review too brief? Because I feel like I could easily sum up this entire game experience without much more than 2 syllables...boring! You know, as I played, I could see the strategies that players might use. I could see how someone could learn to place tiles/meeples to set up for big scores. But I just found it so deadly dull. The turns were so repetitive, and yet they were long. Part of that is because it seems that the best move is calculable, so we all would just sit there in analysis-paralysis trying to deduce where we would get the most points. My wife described it as a more complex and restrictive version of Carcassonne. The problem is, what makes Carcassonne enjoyable is the lack of complexity and restrictions. Perhaps if the game had even a twinge of theme it would have made it more enjoyable, but as it stands I just wanted to quit halfway through. I guess I'd play this game again if someone asked really nicely, but I got rid of it as fast as possible.

We have played this more than 5 times now, and that we only do with games we like.

RATING: 8.2
Highly enjoyable, similarities to Carcassonne. Uprated after second play, and again after third. I found the cards limiting in the first play, but on reflection they are not that limiting - just enough to make you diversify and manage the risk.

This is a game that is all about maximising each turn - scoring twice or 3 times with everything you play is key, and that also means setting up flexible structures to allow you to score again in future rounds.

Far less simple than it looks.

*Update* - 100 games in and I am still enjoying it. That says something. Not sure what, not sure whether it says it about the game or about me, but it says something.

Fairly tactical and can be bound by the luck of the draw, but I found the game to be excellent (two players).  The pacing is good and can be controlled by the players.  It's an abstract game with cards and theme that works well with the game.  Better than I orginally thought it would be. 

Update:  I find it just as good with four...actually a bit easier to score, I felt, with more people.  Not nearly as chaotic, really not chaotic, as I thought it might be.

Plays well as a 2 player game. Use cards to select co-ordinates on a 5x5 sector grid, 6 smaller squares make up each section and each can take a tile or a meeple. Scoring is done by 3 meeples next to each other or meeples being next to tiles with different scoring abilities. There's also a joker and a take anohter turn tile and other tiles can refresh those once they are played. Nice and simple.

AP ruins this game as a lunch game.  We'll never be able to finish in under 1 hour.

Not enough control or strategy for me, and the theme is fairly thin. I'd probably prefer it as a 2 player - more control and much less downtime. **Update, played it again, and dropped my rating - really found this tedious, you can't plan much in advance so with 4 the downtime is just that - no point in thinking about your turn just wait for the others to optimise their turns. Spent most of the time wishing we were playing Carcassone H&G or the City ...

RATING: 7
Nice tile/meeple placing game. The Placement is driven by 2 cards which affect the coordinates. In regular every placement gives you and/or the players VP`s. The Joker and Double Movement Action are very good implemented, because they can be recycled by proper placement. The hidden VP`s by gold and coal mines is a nice twist, so in the end there is tension because leader/winner can`t be well predicted.
Maybe we got here a favorite for "Spiel des Jahres" 2008.

The card draw combined with the small hand size makes Oregon almost entirely tactical in nature.  As such, it is a very nice "gateway" kind of game that gives players just enough choices to agonize over on their turns while still playing quickly - a 4er game plays in the advertised 45-60 minutes.  

I like the way the cards control your placement only partly - the "Joker" and the way buildings are placed gives you considerable latitude to use your cards the way you want.  But you also need to be clever about it.  I also like the way you need to decide between refreshing your Joker and Extra Turn markers with lower scoring tiles, or going for higher scores.  The coal and gold tokens hide the final score, which is helpful in a game where you often have to decide what other player you will help along with yourself - helpful, that is, in keeping the game light and less antagonistic than it otherwise could be.  

I personally would prefer more control, and more long term strategy, but this is a great game for those who just want to focus on each turn as it comes and not worry about the larger picture.    

As a 2 player game, Oregon begins to offer some control and advance planning, although it is still a highly tactical game.  It is enjoyable, but light.  Interestingly, it feels a lot like a lighter version of Arkadia.  Those who want a similar game with relatively simple rules generating a large decision space, but with a lot more strategy and less luck would do well to try Arkadia.

Enjoyable placement game.  I think that clever placement (leaving yourself open to as many scoring opportunities that you can) can overcome the luck of the draw, but the rest of my group feels differently (they like it a lot less than me).  Feels a little like Carcassonne in that a lucky draw or an opening left by your opponents can lead to a big jump in points.  While I like it, the reception by the rest of the table was negative enough that it's unlikely to get played much.

RATING: 7.5
Oddly reminiscent of Shark - in that you're building up holdings on a grid and score for connections - but very unlike it in almost all other ways.  While you are constrained by  the cards you draw each round they usually give you some decent options; but oftimes they won't.  Whether you see that that and the fact that there will be the odd turn where you (or more likely one of your competitors) get exactly the right cards and score big as an acceptable level of luck is likely to determine whether you like this game or not.  Not for perfect planners then, but I liked it and look forward to playing again.

RATING: 3
Blargh, what a boring game.  I think the game works just fine, it's just that it's incredibly unfun.  The whole game revolves around drafting the right cards and then figuring out how to play them to score the most points.

A nice game that I hope to pick up in the futue. You play farmers and buildings to the board by using a combination of two cards that represents a grid reference to where you are allowed to play your farmer or building. When you play either you score points for everything around where you place. 5 Plays.

Bland euro which I did not find to be at all fun and which failed to evoke for me the adventure of settling in the state of Oregon. There's no interaction unless you call 'setting up others to profit from your lack of choice', interaction. You wait for your turn and then analyse all your options given your cards. It's very difficult trying to set yourself up to score well in future turns as your hand size is so small so you largely score using others' building placements.

Initial rating "6" after one play. Not bad. Neat little game of filling a grid with meeples and buildings. The board is a little tough to read at times, and the small hand of cards can be frustrating when you draw a bad hand, but I like the simple set of choices on each turn, and the game flows pretty smoothly.

Not sure if I'd ever own it, as I have plenty lighter pseudo-gateway games, but I'd play it again.

~11 plays. Quite fun game! There's a lot more to it than I anticipated. I think it has one cowboy boot on the lighter side, and one on the middle-deep, making it feel easy, constrained, sly, lucky, opportunistic, jostling, confounding - in a word, Fun. The tension is light in the beginning, and grows as placement fills up. It's a keeper. The way the mechanics model land rushes is fantastic. If you can, grab while the gettin's good. The double move power allows you to set up resources and also score for yourself at at once, but it isn't easy. Yet another bonus of this game is hearing Deivida's voice get so high pitched that dogs three blocks away start to bark. And hmmm.... I've heard of this curious place called Oregon somehow.

Have played several times (2P) and really enjoy it. May replace Stone Age (which I gave to my niece and nephew) in my collection. My husband and I are probably of equal skill at this game, so the draw of cards and of mine tiles generally swings this to one or the other.

So I finally played Oregon. It is an excellent lightweight spatial game, and is staying in the collection. People say it is an abstract and has a pasted on theme. Well, I disagree, as much as I disagree that Euphrat & Tigris is an abstract. As good with 2 players as it is with more, provided they play competitively. This game needs to be reprinted. Heck if it gets a bit overhauled with variants etc, it is a future SdJ candidate. Seek it out and buy it, a perfect gateway game.

---

+ easy to teach
+ quick to play
+ clean rulebook
+ well balanced
+ no player downtime
+ can influence when the game ends
+ solid negative (and a bit of positive) player interaction
+ highly replayable
+ nice mix of tactics and strategies which become apparent after a few games, this is not a purely tactical game

= luck of the draw (cards, VPs), which, considering the weight of the game, is welcome

- a bit of AP-inducing, in the first few games or with AP-prone players

Relatively quick-playing tile layer/area control game.  I enjoyed this one very much - I especially liked the grid play and the use of the joker and extra turn tiles followed by positioning to "recharge" those powerful tiles.  Worked great with my 9 y.o. daughter who managed to fly by me on the very last turn by using both the above-mentioned tiles to score > 20 points on one turn! 
The church scoring rule is a little confusing - when placing a church building, score separately for EACH meeple around the church ( i.e. multiply the number of meeples around the church by the number in your color to get your score).  When placing a new meeple next to a church, only score that meeple.

This game might have invented analysis paralysis!  Stare at your cards and then stare at the board to determine which of a number of choices is the best one for that turn.  Pay no attention to the theme, as it's irrelevant - this is really about area control.

It's really grown on me with repeated plays - what at first seems random evolves into clever strategic options.

Place buildings on mountains, forests, train tracks or along lakes. Positioning your workers next to buildings (or vice versa) earns you points. The unique mechanic is how your available placement locations are determined--by using a pair of cards as a "coordinate pair". (E.g. the pair Eagle-Buffalo will allow you to build in the board region which is the intersection of those two types.)

Once the board is all set up, a 2-player game can be played in a half-hour... so it crams a lot into a very short time.

I'd give this an 8, but there's a bit too much randomness. Sometimes you can't get any good coordinate pairs, or you keep drawing weaker buildings (for example, your opponent can get all the gold mines, but you only draw the coal mines... or he gets all the harbors, but you get just post offices). Sure, you can attach to his buildings later, but he still has the initiative. Playing a best-out-of-3 series smooths out the randomness.

I've only played this one, so take my rating with a grain.  The rules were very clean and simple, so I very excited about it when we started.  But then I felt overwhelmed with the number of options I had to go through to figure out what I could do.  And it was confusing - I kept forgetting my earlier options as I went through the later ones. 

In the end, I felt like I had little control over where I could place pieces in future turns, so the only thing that seemed to matter was maximizing my immediate points for the turn.  So it felt like my score was mostly a measure of whether I would waste other people's time and try to figure out my best option for the turn.

I am not a fan of having a lot of options on my turn, especially when it takes a while to figure out what all of the options are, and how many points they would lead to.  If all it takes is time to figure the options, then a computer (or a monkey) could figure out the best move. 

My favorite games have very few options, but they lead to long-term ramifications, instead of immediate points.  Then I am forced to make a judgment about what's the best course of action.  Oregon did not provide that experience for me.

Players are settling the state of Oregon, establishing settlers and building infrastructure.  Players take turns playing a pair of cards that gives two locations on the game board to place a settler or building.  Both score points for things that are adjacent.  As more and more pieces are placed, the scoring escalates quickly.  Game ends when building stacks deplete.  Pleasant Hans im Glueck game that typically works just as you would expect - very well.  Sits comfortably alongside the excellent Finca, Hacienda, Thurn und Taxis, Stone Age, etc.  Kind of reminds me of the positional/opportunistic play of Carcassonne - get in and score your points.  Lovely presentation too.

Kipróbáltuk a 3 fős játékot és a többiekkel ellentétben én jót szórakoztam. Ez egy könnyed stratégiázást, inkább taktikázást igénylő, kellemes pontszerző játék, amely az 1800-as évek telepeseinek világában játszódik. Kevés, jól érthető szabállyal rendelkezik, habár a nagymamának meggyűlt a baja, az emberkék és épületlapkák lerakásának szabályával. Az embereket 2 tájkártya, míg az épületeket 1 tájkártya és egy épületkártya segítségével helyezünk a táblára, ez kavarodáshoz vezetett rendszeresen. Főleg azért is, mert mindenkinek van joker lapkája, amivel egy tájkártyát ki lehet váltani, de ez addig inaktív marad, amíg egy épület segítségével újra nem aktiváljuk. Ez már egy kicsit sok volt szegény jóasszonynak :). Ehhez jön még az extra akció lapka, melynek segítségével eggyel többször lehet embert vagy épületet felhelyezni, mely használat után szintén inaktívvá válik, amíg egy épület segítségével újra nem aktiváljuk. A játék szépsége a pontok szerzésének sokszínűsége (7 épület 7 féle módon + az emberkék segítségével) és az extra akció és joker lapkák által való előnyhöz jutás. A játék nem kevés szerencsét tartalmaz, hiszen kártya vezérelt, meg a bányákban is véletlenszerűen jutunk bizonyos pontokhoz, de ez engem egy családi játéknál nem igen zavar. Nem tudom, hogy mennyire van kiegyensúlyozva a játék, de nekünk sikerült 5 ponton belül végezni mindannyiunknak. A játékidő első alkalommal soknak tűnt, de szerintem az egyórás játékidő simán tartható. Összességében egy remek játékot ismertem meg, amivel máskor is szívesen játszom. Ajánlom könnyű stratégiát kedvelő családoknak. (2014.11.22.)
Kipróbáltam a szüleimmel is, gyakorlatilag ugyanaz a tapasztalat, a kártyákkal való terület meghatározás, valamint a joker és extra akció lapkák újra aktiválásának szabálya gondokat okozott, így ezt a játékot a nagyszülőknek nem ajánlom. Nekem nagyon tetszett, ahogy a 4 db kártya és az extra akció plusz joker lapkák segítségével milyen jó kis kombinációkat lehetett létrehozni a több pont szerzésének reményében. Nem véletlenül voltak olyan népszerűek a vasútállomás (amivel az 1 GyP megszerzése mellett az extra akció lapkát is újra lehet aktiválni) és raktár (amivel az 1 GyP megszerzése mellett a joker lapkát is újra lehet aktiválni) épületek.

You can get screwed by not having the right cards, but clever play of the joker tile can get you around some of that. It's a fairly simple game to explain, and plays in about 45 minutes. Some good analysis and strategy here. When it's not your turn, you'll be analyzing the board for possible plays, and hoping other players don't get to the spots you want to play before you do.

Enjoyed this - there's a large element of luck in the way the cards come out (and the value of gold and coal mined) but various ways to make the most of one's hand.  It's light, quick, well made and has pretty cowboy-hatted meeples!

lovely light euro, reminds me for some reason of carcassone and a good choice for someone who likes carcassone and wants something similar but with different mechanics or someone who wants an nice entry level euro but wants something as little more unusual. Having played lots of carc with loads of the expansions, this will replace Carc as it takes less time to play and is liked by my wife.

Oregon is a charming abstract type game with the cutest little cowboy meeples. This probably adds quite a lot to the attraction of the game. The limited hand size means that you have to be quite lucky with the card draw and the game can be no fun and quite frustrating if you feel like you can't do anything on your turn. You have to take risks in which cards you use to place your buildings vs cowboys and if you have a bad game the scores can vary widely. There was one game I was leading 72 to 5. Ouch! Were it not for that, I would rate the game an 8.

Very quick simple game, good fun, but not a lot of depth to it. Some planning, but more just optimising your move each turn. Good fun though and much less random than I expected.

[floatright][size=5]2013-09-17[/size][/floatright][u]Overview[/u]
In Oregon the players position settlers and buildings on the board in order to score the maximum number of points.

Despite this premise, the game is not an abstract: the land is partitioned in five rows and five columns, each assigned to one of the five symbols. Each player has four cards drawn from two different piles: landscape cards (showing one of the five symbols) and building cards (showing one of the eight buildings). Two landscape cards are played to place a settler (in an area whose coordinates are the symbols played), and one for each kind is played to place a building (either in the row or column of the symbol played). The players also have a joker and an extra turn tokens; the first is played instead of a landscape card and works as any symbol, the second is used to play a second combination during the player's turn.

[u]Strategy and comments[/u]
Players strive to optimize timing and their settlers' placement. The first moves will often be spent seeding the board with lines of three settlers in order to get the maximum score out of buildings and the 5 points bonus for three adjacent settlers. Buildings usually arrive later, as having as many landscape cards in hand as possible increases flexibility. But often, when they arrive, they pour: crowding the space around settlers like flies around a piece of meat. Another important factor in positioning is deciding which of the map's features you want to be near to (mountain, water, grassland and railroad) and how to spread your settlers in order to maximize your chances of completing most of your groups of three. Timing is choosing appropriately whether to wait one more turn or to use the extra turn token, or whether something is urgent enough to warrant the use of the joker token. Both tokens can be reused by placing a settler beside a specific building (store for the joker, railway station for the extra turn), so in some games they will be very precious and will be used sparingly, while in others the players will be able to reuse them a few times. Finally, it is important to block "hot" spaces where your opponent could score a lot of points and to use, whenever possible, the buildings they place to your advantage.

The game is very simple, but it contains a good amount of decisions. Luck is certainly a factor: you'll have games where you get everything you need at the right time and others where you wait all the game for that elusive gold mine only to have an opponent block the right spot when you finally get it, but it is possible to limit its impact by managing well your hand and positioning well your settlers.

Rarely, the reserves of gold or coal tokens (drawn when a settler is bordering a mine) will exhaust during play. The manual makes no reference about this, so it is unclear how the tokens should be given out if there aren't as many as needed when a player places a mine. This should definitely have been addressed in the rules.

Nagyon szeretem az egyszerű, de ötletes tile placementeket. Kicsit hacienda feelinget vártam a leírások alapján. Sajnos az első játék után csalódnom kellett. Nem sok értelmét láttam, inkább tevékenység volt, semmint játék. A tevékenység arra irányult, hogy minden lépésnél meg kellett találni az egyetlen értelmes kijátszható kombinációt, vagy konstatálni kellett, hogy jelenleg nincs ilyen, így valamit kényszerből kellett lépni. Lehet, hogy kettőnél több fővel jobban működik, mert jobban benépesül a pálya. Adok neki még egy esélyt.

Play cards to place buildings on the board, then play cards to put cowboy meeples next to them and score points. Or vice versa. The cards tell you where in a coarse coordinate grid you're allowed to put your meeples or the unaligned buildings.

There is a bit of hand management involved here but then the hand is pretty small (4 cards, 2 of which you play each turn) so there are obvious limits to how much you can do with good play. Jörg insists it's actually deeper than it looks at first, though. He might be right. I just don't think I care very much either way.

A light/medium tile placement game heavy on tactics.  Oregon relies heavy on a players ability to optimize each turn, and because of this (even with random elements) can lead to some AP in early games. However, once the game begins to unravel itself (after decoding the board) the game becomes a fairly fast paced outing.  A strong choice for in between heavier fare on game nights, and pleasant for the family to play.  Nice production values.

After finishing one turn, I thought this game was going to be entirely uninteresting, too much randomness to offer anything meaningful.  By the end of the game, with lots of stuff on the board, it was clear that there were in fact some interesting placement decisions to be made.

I don't know how I let this one slip by me for so long. This is a great game with simple rules. There can be a little luck involved, but for the most part you have some control over it, if you play your cards right.

The components looks great and the game is just beautiful. This is a fairly light game that can be enjoyed by everyone and may make a decent intro to board gaming also. Give it a shot and see if you like it. You can play for free on yucata.de to judge for yourself like I did.

Update: Now over 400 games online at yucata. Never tire of this game.

After 300 plays at yucata.de, I have no choice but to confess I adore this game, in spite of the sometimes vexing luck of the draw. Always fun to play, and always high anticipation for one's next move during opponent's turn. Pulling off a move that exhausts all one's cards and bonus tokens AND flipping them back over to their active state is very satisfying.

I prefer two-player, where aggressive blocking and zero-sum denials can be rewarded. 

My game of choice at yucata.de. Ask me for a game if you see me there. But be forewarned: I AM THE KING OF OREGON! FIREBIRD!

Nice tactical placement/point gathering game.  Theming is good, limited cards held restricts choice enough to stop it bogging, but Joker and extra turn tokens give plenty to think about and good management of them is crucial.  Nothing too deep but well done. Will fill the 'super-filler' role nicely, figure 45 mins or so once everyone knows the game.

Added to wishlist after a few games on Yucata, and subsequently received the game as a Secret Santa gift from my weekly game group.

Simple idea (that looks great on paper): you have to combine cards from your hand to put tokens and tiles on the board. The problem is that the game is not that easy to play for the light (and fast to explain) family game it should be: see where the intersection of your cards is on the board is quite tiring and still doesn’t always bring that much interesting choices.

RATING: 6
Fairly original central mechanic where you use cards to match row and column of the areas where you place your pieces. But the game is too much dependent on luck of the draw. It doesn't help that some buildings are inherently better than others. The cards determine what you can do, and the very small hand size doesn't allow for any planning. As you need a cowboy of yours to be adjacent to a building in order to score, and most of the time you can only place either the cowboy or the building in a turn, the game also suffers from the problem of setting up opportunities for the next player. It might work as a family game, but some people get quite confused by the system of coordinates. It isn't bad, really, and I may play it on occasion, but after several plays I felt I didn't need to own it and eventually sold my copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great light Euro that plays excellently with two. (Be sure to remove the fire cards from the deck when playing with two!)

The card coordinate system is clunky and thematically non-sensical. The geography of the board bears almost no resemblance at all to Oregon. And the game suffers from some pretty bad graphic design gaffs: the two types of cards have very similar backs, and many of the buildings are hard to distinguish at a distance. It's really no surprise that this was the designers' first published game. There's no reason this should be a good game, but somehow it all works, and it's really charming to boot.

Unfortunately out of print. If you come across a copy, pick it up!

Not bad, maybe a little bit dry. I'm thinking of house ruling the instruction that you have to take at least one building and one landscape card when filling out the deck.

RATING: 5
A fun game that is very tactical with little planning.  A little dependent on lucky card draw and your opponent's card draw.  The meeples have giant hats.  The church is obnoxious.  There isn't much strategy.  Half the game is trying to cross reference the pictures on the cards to figure out what you can do.  On your turn, either figure out how to score the most points or set yourself up for next turn.  Usually, there are only a few relevant combinations in your hand, so the choices are pretty limited, its just a matter of going through what you can do and scoring the most points you can.  There just isn't much here.  

UPDATE:  Played again after  3 years without playing it.  I feel the exact same way.  I think whoever manages to use their extra turn and joker the most times will win the game, and if two people use them a similar number of times, the tie will go to the person who is able to line up the most spots where they are dropping into three buildings...  such plays are so efficient that if you luck into a few of them by having the correct cards in hand it can give you the game.  

The card luck doesn't usually strongly effect the outcome but when it does it is very annoying.  

Overall not my favorite but something I would play.

Yet another meeple/tile placement game involving tactical opportunism. Options are extremely limited due to row/column layout of the board and a small hand size. Much of the VPs come from random draws from the (known distribution) coal and gold mines, and those who make the best use of the joker/extra action resets are likely to do well. There is some interesting interaction in trying to take advantage of other's placements for scoring opportunities.

(06/2008) This game has the perfect balance of simplicity and strategy, with little downtime, and play in 30 to 45 minutes. Yes, there is luck with the draw of the cards, but that's half the fun. IMHO, this is much better than Carcassonne. Highly recommended if there are 4 players, 45 minutes, for a easily learned, light 'filler' game that can be taught in 5 minutes. With 3 players, the game goes quick at 30 minutes. Novel and easy to play mechanics make it an excellent gateway game for adults and children alike, yet it has enough subtle strategy to satisfy veteran boardgamers. 

Update (2/24/09): After playing this 15 times, I believe this is a severely underrated "classic" game. Our group never turns down an opportunity to play this, as it is quick, yet meaty enough to satisfy all tastes. The theme is thin, as in: "what does this have to do with Oregon?", but the artwork and watching the meeple communities grow on the board give the feel of the old west. The mechanics with the extra turn and joker are simply brilliant. I'm upgrading this to a '10'.

Update (3/10/09): Taught this to three newbies. Two of them loved it, while the third thought it was too random for his tastes. Sure, the cards are random, but are a number of things you have to counteract this: 1) Making sure to make plays that clear your hand (getting rid of all four cards, or at least three); 2) Using the Joker and Extra Turn tokens effectively; 3) Long term planning for the "big" play; 4) Using the 3x meeple 5 pt scoring to generate points when you can't do much of anything else (which sets up for the "big" play in the long run). Like a reviewer said of Stone Age, if you think this game is too random, you don't get it.

Update (10/04/09) 31 plays: I'm simply don't get tired of playing it yet! Managed to get several other fans too. If you have 3 players waiting for others, and 30 minutes, this is the game to play. On the other hand, Dominion takes a bit longer to set up and put away.

Update (08/26/10) 40 plays: still loving it.

Update (11/27/10) 45 plays: I've made the stretch that this is somewhat like Brass in play, and that's probably why I (and others) enjoy this game so much, despite it's seemingly simple mechanics. Both games have cards that determine play location as the central mechanic. What cards show up are random in both games, and in both games represent opportunities. It is up to the players to maximize scoring based on these opportunities. The players must be flexible and adaptable to react and take advantage of the plays of the other players, or constrain their opponents. Thus, it seems like the game is playing you, but you have the final word on how to play your cards. Further, how you use the joker and extra turn tokens is key to doing well. The "feel" of the game is directly attributable to the number of railroad and general store buildings in play.

Update (9/11/11) 55 plays: If I was stuck on an island with three other friends, this would be in my top 10.

Update (11/20/11) 60 plays: Possible "quick kill" strategy, if one is getting nothing but train stations and general stores--place the buildings together next to each other, then play one card w/ joker to place meeple near the pair, go again, play another one card w/ refreshed joker to place another meeple next to the last placed meeple. This gets meeples on the board fast, and may end the game earlier than others expect.

Continuing with the Brass analogy: meeple placement is similar to track laying in Brass--the meeples you surround a building are almost like the gold circles you score in Brass for each canal/track link to a city with flipped buildings.

Update (04/21/12) 81 plays: Two people who know how to play this well can crank this out in 15 minutes! It plays as fast as Bughouse, in terms of pace, and really works your mind against an equally capable opponent.

Update (10/14/2013) 103 plays: I used to think 4-player was "best" for this game, but I am knocking it down to "recommended". I believe 3-player is the sweet spot, as 4-player is too chaotic for my tastes--there is simply too much that can happen in between your turns. 2-player is "recommended" too, but feels too much like chess to make it "best". It is still a greatly overlooked and underrated design.

Update (02/02/2014) 107 F2F plays: another unsatisfactory 4-player. The cards were terrible. Only a single train station (to refresh the extra turn token) showed up. All ingredients for a slow, low-scoring, unpleasant game. This is the exception, but I guess there are bad experiences, even in Oregon.

Simple game to teach. Has a bit of a placement puzzle on how to make the most of your four-card hand.

The only way to get rid of your cards is to play them. Putting down a in an empty spot of the board gives you more flexibility for the future than a random building (which might just be helping other players a LOT and you not at all). There is a go-again and joker token that you can refresh by placing a meeple next to a specific type of building. It can help create more flexibility in your turns.

RATING: 7
I'm strongly tempted to compare it to Carcassone.  Lay tiles based on what you draw, place your meeple to score the most points, and repeat.  I do think it's a better game because 1) the luck of the draw is mitigated by your having more choice of what to place and where and 2) it's a lot shorter. Knowing when to use the special tiles is key.  It's also much easier to follow what's going on.  A decent light game.

First played May 19th, 2010. Taught in 10min, played in about an hour with 4 players. The game has a good theme and luck/strategy mix. Each player starts out with 14 meeples, a random starting resource tile to place, a "take another turn" token a "joker" token and 3 cards (2 from the coordinate deck and one from the resource deck). Once you use a token, you flip it over and it gets reset in scoring senerios. The board has many squares that are in columns and rows with headers from 5 types (matching the coordinate deck). Starting with a chosen starting player, each player places it's starting resource tile and then places a starting meeple (observing scoring). Next everyone places a second meeple, then gameplay begins. On each turn you may place two coordinate cards (place a meeple in a row or column matching the first and second card; either card can be the row) or a resource card and a coordinate card (place the resource in either the row or column of that type. You may also use the joker (if unused) to replace any coordinate card. When you place a meeple you score all resource tiles touching it (diagonal or orthanganal). You flip your token(s) if it touches them. If you place on the 1-8 scoring, you get the VPs for all meeples touching it. You may not place your meeple in the water. If you place a resource tile, all meeples touching it recieve the score, even your opponents. The resource tiles must be played to match the board terain color. You may play again if you of the another turn tile available and have enough cards remaining. the game ends when the numbers of resources equaling the numbers of playes is exausted OR someone places their 14th meeple. This is an interesting game which is worth a gameplay if you know someone who has it, otherwise, consider purchase.

A fun game! Early in the game it is hard to figure out what you want to do (unless you have just the right cards) but as the board fills up it is easier.

The mechanics of using the cards to find a couple of areas where you can place farmers or buildings is different and could pose a problem for somebody with AP (Analysis Paralysis) but it is a fun game I would play again.

Clever game design in the tile-laying family of games.

My first play reminded me a bit of my first play of Hacienda, in that there seemed to be one too many things (i.e., tile laying mechanics, card selection and variable scoring tiles) going on to truly get my brain around.  That feeling has faded with additional plays, and the game has grown on me.

And although I do think the card-driven farmer / building placement mechanic is a neat design, I do understand the concerns that many express that it makes the game too random - in that you can't always control your own destiny in the game (even if the 'joker' token does provide some mitigation).  That being said, I don't think the randomness is unreasonable or inconsistent with other tile laying games.

Very good game for two players, very easy mechanics and fairly heavily luck-driven which makes it good for casual gamers and more hardcore gamers to play together.

Can get frustrating if the 'wrong' cards are drawn several turns in a row, and often the interaction between the players is 'negative' (meaning you only ever get to hurt the other players, no trading mechanic).  But these are minor criticisms.

Definitely worth buying for two players, 3 and 4 player game is perhaps not as enjoyable as board becomes crowded and it becomes nearly impossible to maintain a strategy.

Wow, I found this a bit brain burner-ee.  I didn't see it as a family game at all.  I suppose it could be played at a number of levels, but a number of games fit that description without earning the "family game" label.  I enjoyed my play, and look forward to giving it another go.  Oh, one important complaint, the graphical element is something of a let down.  The buildings are not intuitive to their function.  The "Port" looks like a warehouse.  Nothing about the post-office looks like a post-office.  I am afraid this graphic design without understanding of the setting or context.  The problem is not just stylistic, as the types of buildings in play matters greatly to strategy.

One of the better games of Essen 2007 for me.

Oregon is a simple tile/meeple-placement game, where placement of farmer meeples in the proximity of buildings (and vice versa) yields VPs. Your placement opportunities are determined by the cards you have, but these still allow you quite a bit of room for decisions.

My impression so far is that Oregon is a very solid light/middle-weighter from Hans im Glück - and one I didn't at all have on my radar prior to Essen. The game was played everywhere at the fair, though, and was obviously very popular - and I can see why.

Light tactical tile laying euro game with good looking components where you try and make the best of the cards you get dealt, try to setup big scoring situations and try to leach on positioning of opponents. I do think the coal mines are very unbalanced. They have the same laying limitations as gold mines but only give two points on average instead of four from the gold mines.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In Oregon, players play either a cowboy or a building tile and score points for cowboys placed next to buildings and buildings placed next to cowboys. Continue until a certain number of building stacks are depleted or all cowboys of one player are placed. Gold mines and coal mines give a variable amount of secret points. These are added to the public points and most points wins. Players are limited in their placements by their small hand of cards that include buildings and locations. Locations indicate columns and rows where placements can be made. Make the best use of your cards to win. Players also have a location joker tile and an extra turn tile that can be readied for re-use with certain buildings.

There is nothing more to the game than that. It is pleasant to play and well-designed, but won't blow anyone away with originality. If you like easy and relaxed tile-layers, you should definitely check this one out.

This is a game that initially seems like a light kids game, but then you realize that there can be some interesting strategies. Players have a hand of four cards with at least one being a building type and at least one being a column or row symbol. A building can be played with a symbol card so that it can be placed in that symbol's column or row. Meeples can be placed at the intersection of two symbol cards. Note that these intersections have multiple cells for placement. Meeples score when they are adjacent to buildings with the scoring affected by building type. Mines can also be played like buildings, but these generate treasures with values that are hidden until the game end. Scoring also occurs when buildings are placed beside meeples. Each player also has a joker and a go again tile that can be used once, but then can be reset by special buildings. It's a fun, light strategy game.

This is a very light game. The randomness of the card draw has a huge impact on how well you can do in the game. The decisions are not very interesting when you have occasion to make one. It feels very punishing when you have crappy cards and there is no recourse or mechanic to help you out. The luck is supposed to magically even out to make the game fair :(

I've played this game a lot, the 20+ plays do not include at least twice that many more on yucata.de.  I have become very good at the 2 player, and don't lose that often.  3 and 4 player are more of a challenge, as there is much more "darn it!  I wanted to place there!" in those games.  I think its a fun, challenging game with a reasonable playing time.

An interesting game, kind of relaxing and low-key.  Usually when I say this about a game what I really mean is that there isn't a tremendous amount of thought to be invested in the game and you pretty much just play tactically, optimizing your cards and planning as much as possible given the luck of the draw.  I like the theme, which is a little different, though still completely pasted on.  I would be happy to play this, just probably wouldn't be on the top of my list with so many other games competing for attention.

For me this game bears reminiscence to games like New England, Salamanca and also a bit towards Carcassonne. The gameplay is relatively simple, but the addition of jokers and extra turns to the game makes it a tad more interesting. These two concepts combined with the unique coordinate system also make the game drift away from the family game category. Many people seem to be confused about how the game works. What is not so nice is that most often there is some clear best move for your turn. In that sense the game is very tactical and there is very little room for long term planning. Even more so, because the most reasonable wayto play  is to rush your farmers to the board. Playing farmers in strictly stronger than building up the infrastructure. The amount of luck is not small, but it could most of the time be handled. The luck around gold and coal also makes the endgame more intensive as you'll never know who's going to win until the very end. Regarding the theme of the game, I think it's quite strong with its ever growing towns.

I played this game recently, after having been introduced to Kingdom Builder. I find the concepts of both games to be similar, but with Oregon just simply doing it better with the ability to be more flexible in executing turns. The game doesn't suffer for as much variance due to its extra actions that can be taken. Alas, the game mechanics just aren't as rewarding as they feel they should be and ultimately I feel the game is devoid of any theme. Cards are drawn, tiles are laid, and points are scored. Simple, fun, but not good enough.

An interesting light-mediumweight scoring game of gathering points by placing pawns next to buildings and/or placing buildings next to your pawns.  A few tricky ideas on re-activating your special Wild Card and Another Turn action tiles.  I'd would rank this higher but it gives me analysis-paralysis some times and that slows the game down for others.

RATING: 5
I have some mixed feelings after playing this game for the first time.  Mistakes can certainly hurt you but I don't mind that aspect of the game.  The biggest issue I have is that you are constrained to playing in the areas for which you have cards which may mean that you cannot place a cowboy meeple in the optimum scoring space which can be very frustrating.  Seems like getting your cowboys in position to score colony points should be a goal as it also provides opportunities to score a large boatload of points if you have the opportunity to build the right building.  The other primary issue I have is that turns can take some time as you try to figure out all the possibilities.  Still, this game is a bit different in how it plays and it does interest me from time to time.

Just when I was going to write this off as one that wouldn't get much play time... then my 9-year old daughter discovers it and we have a winner!  Works nicely with two players.  At first seems like Carcassonne but is really much different.  She says she likes the feeling that "you are building towns in the mountains and putting people to work."

this game is almost broken. It is always easy to tell which location is the most desirable to employ your people. Whether you can do that depends on what cards you have, but you can't plan ahead with cards because you can hold too few of them. Similarly, it is also obvious that you have to put as many people around train stations as you can in order to gain an extra action, but again, you've got to have the right cards. Ok, you can use your wild card and can take it back for later use, but guess what you need to do that? Yes, you have to draw the right cards.

Each hand of cards is a little puzzler in it's own right  - how to get the best points from a single placement.  Easier to strategize with fewer players, but the fun comes with stealing points from everybody else's placements.

This game is totally underrated.  It looks pretty, plays quickly, is simple to understand.  Luck plays a role, but you have tough decisions to make.  A great introduction to new boardgamers as well.  The card drafting mecanic for worker and tile placement is clever, yet slightly random and can be a little frustrating.  However the game is short, so it's not really a problem.  I like that it is a euro but the thematic is so well implemented.  It makes a very good substitutes to Carcassonne, might even be easier to teach, thanks to more obvious scoring. Try this on Yucata.de, I recommend it!  Did I say the game looks pretty?

Light, family-style tile & meeple laying game. A bit random given the low number of cards you have. Players vie for building "buildings" and placing meeples in tactical locations to gain intragame points.   Some points are visible and others are hidden (silver and gold mines). Players build buildings and place meeples by laying cards that choose a row/column location of the item to be placed. Each player possesses a joker token and an extra turn token that can be used at opportune times and to get them back for subsequent turns you must place meeples near specific buildings that trigger the ability to reuse the tile.  At times, figuring out how best to chain actions together and use your jokers can win the game.

A bit more to it than a simple family game but not a gamers game either. Relatively abstract; the theme doesn't invoke western expansion at all.

Oregon is pretty abstract one, but it does have a vague Western theme which is good one and the components are great, especially the cowboy meeples!

It makes the game good that ties different playertypes together, we casual gamers have our fun and serious gamers can try skillful combos. It's a great underrated gem.

What a beautiful game! Excellent components and beatutiful artwork combine with interesting tile-laying and meeple placement to create a game that is completely enjoyable, has high replay value, and has a decent amount of strategy to it. Some Geeks complain about this game having too much luck, but I disagree. I've played this game with my wife everyday since I purchased it and we still see different ways to evolve our strategy. Yes, you are limited by the landscape cards, but that is the WHOLE POINT! What is the best you can do with the card set you have? If you place buildings too early, your opponent will move in and capitolize on your hard work, but you can do the same. This game also allows you to change your strategy to be offensive (move in on your opponents buildings) or defensive (try to block your opponent from moving in on your buildings). Each game offers a different strategy based on starting tile draw and initial card draw. Lots and lots of possibilities and tough decisions, with a little luck thrown in to increase replayability and to prevent experienced players from wholloping on newbies like they are wont to do (e.g. Puerto Rico).

I really enjoyed my first play.  The game is very tactical and is abstract but for me that is a good thing. There is a fair amount of luck in terms of what cards you receive and in the coal/gold chits.  It took me quite a while to get my head around how you could successfully use the train station and general store buildings to maximum effect.  Despite its simplicity this is a good solid game.  If your opponents use their jokers early and a general store doesn't come up they can be in trouble.  Making plays that let you use your extra action chit and renew it on the same turn can be strong.  Our three player game was tense until the end and only 9 points separated us.  Fun.

A pleasant surprise at Essen 2007. Play is easy, but you have to look closely to take your chances for optimal scoring.

Update: Essen 2010 I bought a copy on sale and played it. Disappointment however. Way too much luck of draw. With the wrong cards, you cannot do anything good. I will give it another try perhaps, otherwise it will leave my collection very soon again.

24/11/10 update: enjoyed it better today, upgraded again, will stay in collection for now. There is definitely room for smart play.

Feels like it scratches the same itch as Kingdom Builder, which I also have (play cards to place resources on a map in a position to score the most points).  Oregon is good and offers some interesting strategy in predicting and deciding on the best placement.  However, there's nothing about it that really distinguishes it for me, and it feels like it plays slower than it should -- it's time-consuming to look through your cards and compare all of the available placement options.  Just about everything I like about it, I could compare to Kingdom Builder which I prefer.  I've only played this with 4 players, so I would be interested to see how it plays with 2 or 3.

In the wild west of Oregon, players play down meeples or buildings on a grid. Players have a hand size of four, and play cards to either put down meeples or buildings. Players score points for being adjacent to buildings, or forming groups of their own meeples. It's a simple, fun  with a good dose of luck. Players do have options for an extra turn, or a joker card, which gives you a bit more control. I enjoy playing it. 

The mechanics are simple, and though there is luck in which buildings you draw, you are engaged throughout.

The game play is very simplistic in nature, and you'd think from this that down time between players would be negligible; however, I had a hard time with the column and row aspect of the game, and it really slows down the game for all players.  Difficult when looking at your cards to go "ok, I could put one there...and let's see...there" so on and so forth.  Game play is not especially novel, and to me it's another run of the mill tile placement-point game.  The wild card column-row tile is good, but the extra turn tile just slows the game down even more so.  Especially since, the player has to pick up 2 more cards, and then scan over his hand again to see what they can do.  Also, I don't see much need to ever keep the extra tile active, as you want it inactive, so that you can activate it from a railroad (or store, can't remember) when you place another little cowboy.  So you will always use it.  Pretty worthless tile.  Needless to say, I doubt I'll ever play this one again.

RATING: 7
In Oregon players play cards that will allow them to place meeples and buildings on a board that is divided in a grid-like manner.  To place meeples you play two cards, an eagle and a carriage, you find these two pictures on the side of the board and that dictates the few spots your meeple can be placed.  Same goes for buildings except that only one area card is played along with the building card in your hand.  

Different buildings give different effects, 3 points per meeple, draw a gold card, activate your extra turn, activate your 'wild' card, and so on.  Meeple placement can also net you points.

The one gripe I have with this game is that the player that can consistently get lucky enough to draw cards that allow good placements will usually win.  A good amount of the time I will stall out during the game and have to place two or three things that do not get me any points at all.

I have only played this on Yucata.de, but it is an enjoyable game that might just be a little too much luck dependent.

First impression (4 players): The game has a bit similar feel as Carcassonne. Although here you place your buildings and meeples by using cards you have in hand. I like how it usually doesn't matter in which order you place the buildings and meeples around them. 

The hand limit of 4 cards where one must be a building limits your options a lot sometimes and you cannot plan too much ahead. You're sometimes forced to play something you really wouldn't like to. But overall you success in game is about cleverly playing your cards. Even if you get good cards during the game they don't guarantee that you'll be doing well in the game. Your decisions where and what to play matter more than luck of draw.

The game is very sleek design but quite abstract. Especially the way you play cards in X- and Y-axis to place the meeples just feels a bit too dry. Overall it's a very basic euro design in good and bad.

More than entertaining tile-laying game with an abstract feel - in Oregon players aim to score as many points as possible by means of edifying buildings on the board, occupying the spaces adjacent to them with their own pieces (if they are grouped the scores will be higher) and digging out gold or coal from their respective "buildings". The available spaces on the board for each move are determined with two cards that act as coordinates of the sectors of the board that can be used. There's obviously some luck involved since hands consists of only four cards (two moves the most during a turn), but skillful play of the cards and timing always guarantee a good result. Very very replayable.

Card-coordinated placement game with more control and less awkwardness than something like Carcassonne. The cowboy-meeples are ace, and an unappreciated part of the beauty of the game is the realism with which towns grow up around churches and ports. My big bugbear is that it's possible to win the game well before the notional end as dictated by the rules, which makes for a poor game pace.

I think the impact of luck is far less in Attika than in Oregon. In Oregon, you are limited to 3 land cards, thus you are very constrained by where you can place. Attika has no such restrictions. Some places are easier to place because of terrain bonuses, but you're not prevented from going there. If you don't like the cards you drew, draw new ones, and you can always use 2 as a joker. In Oregon, you're drawing from a pool of imbalanced buildings. One player might just get better opportunities, but in Attika, you draw your own identical set. There is variation in the order in which they might come out, but you can mitigate that by wisely choosing when to draw black vs white buildings. Where Oregon makes up for it's luck is in the scoring opportunities. Knowing how to score maximum points for a turn and betting on the probability of future draws can separate winners form losers. But I get the sense you can "know" where to score, but just not be able to play there.
-----
I think my perception of this game would be much improved with an Attika-style deck of building cards. Once you drill down your first set of cards, you reshuffle them into a new stack, so you can't get a second gold until you've drawn all of your cards at least once.

Oregon is a simple, friendly Euro for four players that takes about an hour to play. Ostensibly it is all about the white settlement and development of Oregon Territory, but the theme is only skin deep. The neatest thing is that players will tend to clump their workers and buildings together, forming towns! There are cool coyboy meeples and a pretty board.

The play area is divided into a 5x5 grid - each of the 25 spaces is further divided into a number of plots where buildings and workers can be placed. Players score points (and occasional bonus actions) by placing workers next to buildings, or placing new buildings adjacent to previously placed workers. Location within the larger 5x5 grid is by playing cards that determine which row and column must be selected: players have very limited hands of cards. At most they will have 3 placement cards to chose from, although they have wildcards available that have to be recharged by a specific building.

I think Oregon is OK, but not particularly captivating. It is very simple to teach, and everyone has picked it up immediately. Oregon would be OK for newish gamers, but I would not choose it to hook new players. It makes a nice change for people who have more experience.

People who have played Aquädukt may find several points of similarity- the placement rules feel similar, and there is often a tendency for settlements to clump together. Oregon has much more control over placements (card choice instead of d20).

This is a great medium weight family game! Nice beautiful board with simple game mechanics! 2-player games are nice and balanced and 4-player games have more variety of play options with a greater use of the board. Nice game! Game takes place in the old western days of settling Oregon. Play 2 cards...one building and one landscape or 2 landscape cards...line them up on the board and place your tile or western meeple man! Collect points by placing meeples next to buildings or other meeples!

Tactical tile placement to max points each turn. There's still enough choice in those 4 cards to create some downtime when deciding where and what to play, especially if the joker and the extra turn are alive, and even though the gameplay is light, the downtime takes it out of family consideration. And yet not enough depth for gamers. All the same, likeable in it's ease.

Its a lightweight tile laying game, in the Carcassonne-plus genre.  The tiles and meeples are placed on a grid, Carcassonne style, but there is considerably more going on.  There is a card game that governs where you can place and interesting interaction between various building types, and between players.  I like the art and production – this has some of Franz Vohwinkle's best work.

One thing I don't like: the coal tiles. It just seems to be an insult to draw coal.

This is a tile- and guy- placing guy in the spirit of Carcassonne.  During your turn, you can either play a tile and score points for all the guys next to the tile, or play a guy and score points for all the tiles next to the guy.  Your card draw constrained where you could play your guy or tile, and what type of tile you could place.  There's more strategy in this game than appears at first, and the meat of it is in trying to chain your guys together to score multiple times with a single placement.

6.5: An okay game. A bit too random for my taste. There are some nice decisions to be made, but you feel hindered by your cards. I don't get the same kind of feeling of building up as in Puerto Rico or Caylus, and it seemed to lack long term strategy.

RATING: 6
Hmm, not bad, not bad at all.
I was kind of suspicious after I saw the game: again some card-driven meeple euro... But this one proved to be a lot more! It's simple, that's true, but it gives you more decisions that it would first seem. Because of the Joker card, you are not so limited. Joker can be used once - but with certain building, it can be reflipped to its unused state.

Oregon is somewhat an one hour game. Sometimes you have to optimize with the cards in your hand and that may take a while. For some people, it may be difficult to see the playable areas but luckily I was ok.

I liked the game more than I assumed I would be. Any prizes given to this one are deserved. Probably one of the best family games!

I think this has certainly become the office favourite out of all the Works games we've bought. It fits nicely into a lunchtime and although quite light it has enough strategy for the 45 minute play time. 

There's a luck factor involved but I've found it only seems to really give you a totally useless card combination (where you can't score any points at all) maybe once per game on average. With this in mind, I think careful use of the joker and/or extra turn can eliminate this problem anyway.

My only gripe with this game really is the card size. Why on earth did the designer/publisher choose to use small cards rather than regular? Fair enough if the cards were for a minor portion of the game (such as in Royal Palace), but they're the main mechanic here!

Still, for the price I paid (£7.99) I think this game was definitely worth it.

Edit: And of course the "language" is a real seller too: 
"Eagle Store"
"Buffalo Wagon"
"People Eagle" (sometimes shortened to "Peagle" now in our group) 
etc

In the beginning when I tasted Euros, the abstract feel didn't bother me. However, I think I have now entered the Siggins phase of really desiring strong theme to mechanics as I found the theme vs mechanics here so wrong. 

I don't think I have played a placement via co-ordinates game before and I think I can understand why this mechanic hasn't caught on: cross-referencing into one of 2 sectors is both visually and mentally disorientating.

I love everything about the game except that it's a luck-fest and very prone to runaway leaders/losers.

A good tactical game with the right amount of luck, planning and interference. Plays quickly and captures the theme of a land rush. The components and art are enjoyable. 

Like the mechanic that tile and meeple placement are driven by a card draft, It does put a random element so your plans must be flexible and opportunistic. It's not a game where you make a long term strategy and spend the rest of the time trying to implement. 
Scoring is much like Carcassone - I liked the inclusion of hidden elements the coal and gold mines give you.

Interesting game where luck-of-the-draw is a large portion the outcome, but solid play should prevail.

A fairly straight-forward "get points through placement" game. Usually the points are an immediate pay-off, but there is some possibility to set-up for future scoring. The weakness is that it is hard to reliably do anything interesting such as fulfil your strategic aims or interact with other players. Blocking an opponent's scoring chance or even muscling in on their building plays is very much at the whim of the cards you hold. The Joker provides some opportunity to mitigate this, but you are unlikely to use it in a blocking play. Works well-enough but not outstanding in a crowded field (it's in the same ballpark as Carcassonne).

Enjoyable, light game with a fair dose of luck. There can be a bit of brain-burning in figuring out how to maximize your points by activating and re-activating your joker and extra-turn tiles and setting up future scoring opportunities. I'd say there's more to this game than you might think by reading the rules. Still, it falls into the family/gateway game category because the rules are simple. Nice production and I like the fact that the box features the photos and bios of the designers and illustrator.

Farmer placement is much too restrictive. With such a small hand, you are purely at the mercy of the luck of the draw for placement on the board. There are clever mechanisms for getting extra turns and the Joker helps a bit. Overall, though, it felt like this was a game that didn't allow you to choose and implement a strategy as much as force you to jump around the board randomly and hope there were options for you there.

For such a straightforward, purely tactical family-style game, this really is a very fine effort from first-time designers Henrik and Ase Berg.

Rating after one play. Nice components in a fairly simple game with no strategy to speak of. The card-based farmer and building placement is new for me (you match landscapes in columns and rows to find places to place the pieces). Even though it's a simple mechanic it's quite hard to figure out where the pieces will go. Also with a very limited amount of choices (you need two landscape cards to place a farmer and you have three at most) it's almost random where your pieces end up in. Plays fast though and I will give it another try. Increased my rating after second game from 4 to 6. Made much more sense the second time around.

A light tile placement game.  Its very tactical as opposed to strategic because you are really limited by the cards in your hand and with only four cards there isn't much opportunity for hand management.

Judicious use of the Joker and Extra Turn tiles is a must.

Cool idea using 2 cards as x-y coordinates, and it fits the exploration theme very well. But it falls flat for me, since you merely optimize what you do with your cards each turn. Card draws are all face down, so you don't really know where your opponent is going next, and don't know if and when you'll get a combo you need. Yes, you can maximize flexibility, but once all players know how, the winner is determined by luck.

I've raised Oregon to an 8 - not because I've discovered some deep element to the game, but rather just because it is pretty fun - despite the fact that I suck at it.

Hoo boy. Another homogenous looking Rio Grande package. This time, it’s about building up your fortune in the the American Midwest. Players use a limited hand of landscape and building cards to place meeples (which score or trigger abilities of buildings they are built next too) or build buildings (which can also trigger scoring or abilities).

The landscape cards correspond to vertical and horizontal axis and allows players to place their meeples or building in corresponding axes. This is the ‘heart’ of the game mechanic and though it works, isn’t really that thematic. Instead, it frustrates if you don’t get the right ones…but wait, you’ve got a joker card to use so it’s a mechanic with an ‘out’.

The buildings offer various special abilities (refresh joker and ‘take another turn’ tiles), VPs or a chance to dig for gold or coal (represented by random tiles with varying VPs). The game clips along nicely but slows a little toward the end as players try to work out the best move to end the game on. Nothing special but it works. Not bad for first-time designers but in this day and age, you have to be really special to stand out.

The person who taught me the game called it a better version of Carcassonne.  It's a quick game and actually rather easy to learn.  The game uses illustrated pictorial cards to determine tile placement on a x/y axis map.  I didn't see anything really unique or bad about the game.  It looks like a good game to teach new players with enough strategy and complexity to interest others.

Épületeket és embereket helyezünk fel a táblára két koordináta által határolt területre kártyáink segítségével. Ezek, ha egymás mellé kerülnek adnak különbözőféle módon pontokat. A játék egyrészt macerás, mert nem könnyű jól átlátni a koordinátákat, másrészt nagy szerencsefaktorú a húzott lapok miatt. Nekem a joker és a plusz lépés lapkák sem tetszettek, szerintem azok nélkül érdekesebb lenne. Igazából sokak számára biztos nem rossz játék az Oregon, nem hosszú, de sajnos nekem a fentiek miatt egyáltalán nem tetszett. Úgy éreztem minden a húzott kártyákon múlik és kevés a játékosokon.

Lighter tactical placement game that warps the brain a little.  It takes a while to figure out how to properly take advantage of the combos, but if played quickly it fast and furious once players get used to it.

This game didn't interest me much at the beginning, but as I got into the game, I enjoyed it more.  This is a game that rewards clever play - you have to think about how to use your Jokers and Extra turns and get them refreshed to help for the next turn.  I will buy this one when it comes available.

RATING: 6
The board is divided into columns and rows (each with an associated symbol), with each grid space divided into 6 squares of variable terrain type. There are 2 types of cards, showing either one of the symbols or one of the building types. Players start with 1 building card and 3 location (symbol) cards. On your turn you play 2 location cards to place a meeple in that grid location (one of the 6 spaces in the column/row of those symbols), or 1 location   1 building card to place that building (from stock) into any square in a column/row of that symbol. You get VP depending on your building/meeple placement. Some buildings also have special powers. 

Game play is pretty simple. There are some decisions to make, but your options seem largely dependent on the luck of the card draw. There is additional randomness when dealing with the coal or gold mines. Fortunately the game plays pretty quickly, but it's not one that I'd expect to play in the long term.

It is a tile and meeple placing game and, lucky enough, I am a connoisseur of those. One places cowboy looking farmers and they score according to their position to various buildings (train station, mines, churches, etc.) which also get placed by the players, both in accordance to the cards on hand. It is a simple game with very straight forward mechanics, I think some might get bored with this quickly but I guess I like boring or rather simplicity in my games now and then. This is the right one for playful afternoons where you don't want to get too invested yet have some fun.

A nice family offering from Hans im Glück. A typical harmless euro, without a very convinving theme, offering just enough decisions to stay interesting. Nevertheless, it plays along quite nicely, offering a small puzzle to solve every turn. Planning the tiniest bit ahead for your next turn is sometimes possible, but generally, it's hyper tactical.
Plays pretty good with two, if you take the fireplaces out.

This is my type of Euro game: easy to learn, incorporates some luck for a bit of excitement but still requires a decent amount of thinking and planning, and is well-themed and beautifully produced.  It makes me wonder why this game hasn't garnered more interest in the 5 years that it's been on the market.  Perhaps it's the same reason that I won't be spending the money to purchase a copy, which is that while it does what it does well and I had a lot of fun playing the game, it doesn't bring anything overly revolutionary or enthralling to the table (and I feel like I might enjoy Carson City more).  I'm not sure if there's enough to the game to maintain interest over several plays, but the variability of card deals and the large number of building spaces on the board would help with that.  Still, playing the game is an enjoyable experience, and I love both the artwork of the board/tiles and the very cute (and plentiful) settleeples.  I think that Oregon would make an excellent gateway game, that would be enjoyed by new gamers and experienced gamers alike.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

There were some real decisions and significant tension that I completely missed my first time around.

This is a game that is played on a nice looking board of the state of Oregon and consists of trying to place cowboy meeples (yes, meeples with stetsons) and buildings to get the most VP's.
Placement is by use of cards and is controlled by a grid over the game board. The card placement is one of the two luck elements in the game. The other luck element is the mining of Coal and Gold. You can be unlucky with this and lose out quite significantly as there is a random amount of points gained from the mining activity.
The hidden VP value of the mining is similar to the destination tickets from Ticket to Ride and gives that end of game accounting where you could be well behind on the VP track and still claim a win.
It all plays in about an hour with 4 players and it's certainly worth a 8/10.

RATING: 6
Tile placement and area management Euro. Gameplay involves using two different types of cards, which depict different buildings and areas of the board, to place either building tiles or meeples (depicting farmers) in order to score points. These points are awarded if the farmers are adjacent to the buildings, and each different building awards points differently e.g. a harbour gains four points, a gold mine gains a gold token of random value, a railway station awards one point and allows a player to reuse their extra turn token etc. Most of what's on offer in 'Oregon' has been seen before (many times) but for a light game there is a fair bit of strategy involved and some thought has to be put into where to place your buildings and farmers, although unusually for a game of this type there is quite a lot of luck involved when drawing the cards and the fact that you can only hold four of these in your hand at any one time adds to the amount of influence luck has on the game. There are issues with replay value as well, as you've seen pretty much all the game has to offer after a few plays.

Strangely enough, Oregon reminds me of China.  Holding onto cards to make the most of limited placements.  You have access to jokers but they are only available if you set them up.  

Part of the game is setting up the big moves and hoping they don't get snagged from you.  The other part is being the aggressor and taking those good spots.  The thing that sets it apart from China, besides the lack of route building, is the gold/coal mining aspect.  This is huge for end game scoring.  

I read a lot of reviews and comments on this one before getting it.  I found it really gets split a few ways, some saying "meh, luck based" to "those who don't understand the strategy, don't get it" to "a pleasant, easy euro".  I fall somewhere on all sides seeing the power of lucky draws, both in cards and chits, the strategy of good spatial awareness and the easy teachability .  It seems it's not for everyone but I like it.

Better with more players.

Play 2 cards and put a cowboy down in the space shown. If one of the cards is a building, that goes in one of the rows instead. Score based on what was there beforehand.

Simple mechanisms, simple rules but enough choices to make it interesting. The game seemed to be about keeping with the pack and perhaps scoring one or two points more than other players here or there which is difficult to plan for when you're drawing 50% of your cards each round (or more).

Essentially, a slightly long filler which isn't too dissimilar to Kingdom Builder, but is perhaps less frustrating...

Great game, though success seems to come down to how well you can make up for unlucky draws of landscape cards. There's quite an art to chaining together your "joker" and "free turn" tokens too.
Edit: With further plays, the luck factor seems to weigh too heavily in this for my liking. Admittedly there's some skill involved, but it's difficult to mitigate ending up with cards that place your meeples in the middle of nowhere, especially towards the end-game.

This game is opportunism come to flesh (or wood & cardboard in this case). You're constantly balancing your actions between how to benefit yourself and how to reap maximum benefits from the actions of others.

Interesting ... but ultimately this game fails to really impress because the luck factor is huge ... draw the wrong cards a couple of turns in a row and a developing area blooms and closes while you look on helplessly. Of course, even when you have cards that can get you into the thick of things, I've seen players agonize over placements. This one feels like it should be light and quick, but doesn't seem to end up that way. Not bad, but with placement options so limited by the luck of card draws, I can't see myself playing this often.

At first, Oregon felt like Battleship gone terribly awry:  the only rows & columns I could use came from the cards I drew.  A four-card hand, to be exact.

A unique euro that involves playing card combinations to place meeples on the board. I really like the way the cards are used here, but with a four-card hand limit, sometimes it feels like your options are too limited.

This game is simply too random at this stage for me. The game rules suggests that we draw cards randomly from the pile. Even after allowing card drafting ala TTR, i still thought the game represented "Doing the best i can during my turn" strategy. That was not much I could do to control my fate. However, the one single rule I didn't understand was - why aren't we allowed to pick up more landscape cards during the draw card phase. The game quickly ended up with one person holding up to three building cards and one landscape card, not enough to put your farmers down.
Game was bland and rather simplistic. Take it or leave it.

Like Vikings, I'm a bit baffled as to why this OOP game (Vikings is also OOP) is so highly rated.  The theme is cool and it's an intriguing variation of Carcassonne, but there isn't a lot of meat here which means replayability is lacking.  I'd rather play Taluva, Carcassonne City or Castle, or Alhambra over this.  Wouldn't turn down a game - it's fine - but it's not great.

Although the mechanics differ, Oregon ultimately feels very Carcassonney. I keep it for the times I want exactly that: relaxing, simple puzzlelike gameplay. There is just enough freedom of choice to allow for some clever moves and small combos - without making one think too hard. In this category, I feel it is underrated.

A little high on the randomness, and there's some wonky balance issues - Coal mines are so much worse than gold mines, for example.  Overall I really do like the game and how it flows, I just wish it did what it does better.

One play, Spiel 2007. Wasn't very impressed. Tile-laying on a board, with placements constrained by the cards in hand. There's some scope for making skilful plays, but it it wasn't as satisfying (or as tense) as Carcassonne can be.

RATING: 7.8
Very interesting tile laying game. Place meeples and tiles on the board, earning points based on how many meeples are gathered around the particular building you played. No distinction is made on who's meeples they are, so you can get points from your opponent's meeples. As well, buildings vary in how many points they give you. 

A neat co-ordinate system of card play means that which "quadrant" of the board you can play in is determined by which cards you play. So, you may want to play in the top left corner of the board, but without certain cards you can't do that.

Light enough. Colourful board. Too colourful perhaps. Neat scoring mechanism. My first game, I was about to win but another player beat me by one point because our third player played in such a way as to give an extra point away.

This game hits a few of my sweet spots - good with 3 to 4 players, 45 minutes or so, medium-light game play, lots of options, limited actions.   Give it a try.   Kind of an Hacienda light crossed with Genesis, maybe.

Commented after 1 two player game. Simple and clever tile mechanism, quite fun to play, but probably better with 3 or 4. Didn't really hit me, but might be a good game for casual players.

Updated two years and one four-player play later. Okay game, nothing special here, but nothing especially wrong either. Carcassonnean feeling, but quite dry.

Two plays, 4 and 3 players. First play was just remembering how to play, second was better, but the overall feeling is still quite dry.

'Oregon', in my view is about the Amish, a Wild West that bears no resemblance to 'How the West Was Won'. A simple game about simple folk.

RATING: 6
Games this extremely tactical usually aren't my cup of tea, but Oregon has a charm to it and is short enough that I really dig it. It is a game of clever, opportunistic moves. The joker and extra move tiles ameliorate the luck of the card draw and are an additional resource to be managed. All in all a great sub-hour game.

RATING: 5
The game is slightly dry, and doesn't really give the feel of settling the old west, but in the theme's place is a nice game of card management and tile placement.  It wouldn't be anything special if not for the extra turn/joker tiles, and the ways that certain buildings can give you those special actions back.  If not for that, the game would be even drier, and less interesting.  It's a short, brain-burning sort of tile placement game that might (might) appeal to the people who like El Caballero or Fresh Fish.  The only down side is that the card draw can be limiting, but the aforementioned joker tile helps to alleviate that limitation somewhat.  It helps to understand that you should play your farmers before your tiles, to maximize your points each turn.  To me, it's a backwards sort of logic, but folks I've taught the game to seem to get it much more easily than I.

Oregon is a simple yet strategic game that's very much underrated and didn't receive the attention it should have gotten. I really enjoy this game :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
pleasing outdoorsy, wilderness artwork, satisfying X+Y card-driven placement mechanic (kinda Maria-like), and really satisfying combos as those coal and gold mines appear around your cowboy meeples. Clever Joker and extra turn reset system.

Starting to think I don't like meeples in any shape or form. They're kind of charmless and toy-like, ill fitting in their primary colours atop most board game art whatever the style.

update: does HABA's excellent new adventureland owe a little to the design of Oregonand its X,Y placement?

Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). A rather light game with some interesting decisions, especially in the use of the two special tiles. It has some randomness (both in the cards you get and in the coal and gold tokens), but a reasonable amount, which is not a problem in a game of this weight.

Started slow, got better as the game went on, good choices but seemed a bit simple. I feel like Oasis fills a similar itch for me so I'm taking this off of my want list. The theme is really pasted on, would have work better geography-wise to set it in Wyoming or Colorado or even Montana.

Wishlist - I had fun learning this from Joel and Susie. I especially liked how the settlements grew into crowded cities as a natural function of the game mechanics.  The board is also quite nice looking. At first I felt things were a bit too random... but as I learned how to manage my hand and consistently take advantage of the token resets I felt more in control.  Our one game was great with 4 players, but it doesn't seem like it would scale down very well... otherwise an excellent, fairly light strategy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was a nice surprise for me.  I thought very little of Oregon after reading through the rules (actually, I didn't even finish because I found it rather uninteresting).  The game played fairly well with plenty of strategic manuvering, even though most of the times it is based on the placement cards you draw.  I imagine Oregon is best with 4 players because in our game with just 3, at least 2/5 of the board remained empty by the time we finished.  So unless you enjoy solatire-like style of gameplay, the more interactions there are creates more opportunities for interesting decisions and situations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The more I play it, the better it gets.  Whoever says that luck dominates Oregon is missing a lot; there's almost always something positive you can do on your turn, or set yourself up for future turns. Lots of room for clever plays. Granted, all of my experience is with 2-player games only, but I haven't seen this "too much luck" syndrome at all.  Good weight for its length.

After 10+ Plays: Though there is a fair amount of luck in the card draws, I've found that this can be mitigated by paying attention not only to what you are playing, but what you are leaving in your hand.  The game is wholly tactical, but I can overlook the lack of strategic options in a game of this length.  The tactics are also quite intricate and interesting, and there are lots of opportunities for creative play.

Fun 2-3 player Napoleonic block war game.

Pros:
Fantastic game. Relatively simple to learn. Lots of flexibility and options. Love the mix of strategic overview and tactical battles. Beautiful map. Can play three player. 2 hour play time. 

Cons:
The blocks obscure the features on the map. Either the blocks need to be smaller or preferably the map should be a third bigger. Map could do with being on a heavier mounted board so that it lays flatter.

A terrific, fluid game with different problems on both sides. The block fog of war is used nicely. I love the point- to-point system and the tactical battles are a sub-game that is just as fun as the strategic game. I'd give it a 10 but the map is too small for the number of blocks in the 3rd edition.

Very good, introductory level wargame that does a good job of giving you a feel of the historical situation without weighing you down with chrome.
It's got plenty of S and T on a simple level, plays fairly quickly and has a very high fun level.  If you buy it and like lighter wargames then it'll get plenty of plays.

Decent intro to block games. I have the original canadian version with the mounted boards, which in my opinion is the one to have. Still, the are some ambiguities in the rules which I find frustrating, and the game typically boils down to two different strategies. Glad I played it, but now I will allow someone else to use it as their gateway game.

I have the fourth edition. Promising: The box art has clearly improved, Biger Map and less units... Apparently the resolution of old problems of this classic (minuscule map and cumbersome piles of blocks)
BUT THEN they decided to increase size of the blocks !!
I never played the first edition of this game, but I suspect it was the best version of it. This is a simple game that was to be KEPT SIMPLE! The scale of Corps was the ideal.

As with most "Hit on" systems wonky results are possible!

Love the look of the AH version with painted blocks and muted colors on mounted board.

Plays moderately quick with potential for some lengthy games as battles get transferred to a battle board and these can take a bit to finish depending on # of units involved and d. rolls.

Interested in seeing what the new edition of the game adds to the fun. Glad they brought back the horse artillery!

I have played the 2nd and 3rd edition. I used to own the 3rd, but I had to get this after I played it.
The 2nd ed has a really cool combat system, but felt like it had too few blocks. The 3rd edition had too many blocks. This has just the right amount. It's not too easy to shatter your opponent in combat and you can't use excess blocks for cannon fodder. I also like the quality of the new blocks and the shiny stickers.
The larger map is wonderful. The mounting on the board isn't up to GMT's standards, but I like it more than the 3rd edition's paper map. The terrain blocks are an excellent touch and the big reason I wanted this edition when I already owned the 3rd. 
This combat is divine. The 3 sections with moving units that engage and disengage and move around through the reserves to other sections is a big improvement over the simplified 3 section combat of Quebec and the sections are a big improvement over Hammer of the Scots and her many children.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the 4th edition much more.  The Avalon Hill version has the best combat system but too few of blocks, feeling like the armies were brittle.

The 3rd edition had too many blocks for my tastes.  But this edition feels juuuust right.  I also like the terrain blocks.  It is a great idea for using the battlefield terrain to your advantage.

RATING: 9
From my perspective as my first time playing Napoleon, this is one of those great games that took a moment to learn and offers a lifetime of enjoyment due to its complexity. I must preface that my "moment to learn" view is from someone who has played three other block games, and so the mechanics are very comfortable to me.  As a game, Napoleon is great for the ease of learning, the complexity for repeated play, and the time. At 2.5 hours it was great! My only negative thought, and negative is too strong of a word, is that the side battles may be too tedious? But I also feel that the feeling of having your neighboring forces sucked into a battle is wonderfully disconcerting. I'm still thinking on that issue.

RATING: 7
A good simple 3 player wargame that expands on the original AH version of the game. The addition of more units makes the game more historical related but do add some extra time and differing strategy to the game.

This version has its own favour as compared to the the one from AH.

Love both games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More units comes with slightly more chaos on the battlefield. Using 3 weak units in a group as a stop gap blocking force seem like a reasonable idea, though you can't always use it.

More untis also gives more tactical option during the battle.

Overall, a good game with slight added complexity, but still not sure if these added time will bear fruit for the eventuality.

The first true wargame I ever owned (and, sadly, gave away decades ago!). Certainly not a deep simulation, but a reasonable facsimile of the historical situation in Belgium in 1815. As a game, it's quite enjoyable and challenging (especially for the French) and is an excellent three player game. Battles are fought on an abstract battle mat, and this is where the game shines (especially if your tastes tend to go towards abstract strategy games).

RATING: 8
Napoleon is a game for 2 players. The mapboard depicts the areas of Belgium and northern France that were important to the Waterloo Campaign.  On the board are three major cities - Brussels, Ghent and Liege along with several other key towns and villages of the time.  There are two types of roads which connect these towns together. Rivers slow the movement of armies when crossing.  A turn sequence of day and night adds to the decisons you will need to make, 'rest for the night' or 'attack before dark'.  The games features a 'fog of war' operational movement and has a separate battle board for tatical movement. There are 4 types of units; Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry and Horse Artillery. Should the Infantry charge or square?  Should the Cavalry be moved to the reserve or attack?  Should the Artillery concentrate it's fire?

RATING: 6
Napoleon presents the players with an interesting situation.  The French face a superior Allied force, yet must attack.  The only things in their favour are greater maneuverability and deploying second and in greater concentration than is possible for the Allies. 

There are no stacking limits and the situation positively encourages the Allies to form big piles of blocks to avoid smaller formations getting picked off.  This results in even more problems than in other Columbia games with important rivers obscured, with moving blocks around and with keeping them correctly oriented. 

Battles fought on the tactical boards felt unsatisfactory to me.  All but those on the scale of Waterloo have the potential to end very quickly, with one side vacating a position on the battle board through unit elimination or morale failure.  The great leaders involved in this campaign are each represented by a block and yet seem only moderately useful.  The death or capture of Napoleon has no particular consequences; L'Empereur des Français is just another lump of wood. 

Production quality of the Columbia fourth edition is to their usual good standards.  My only gripe is with the woods terrain block, misleadingly labelled "infantry only".  The map looks quite appealing.  The rules are an easy read and seem reasonably complete.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that decides what it wants to simulate, pares it down to the bone, and does it really well. It feels very deep for a quick-playing game (1-2 hours) with plenty to think about on every move. The battles themselves are also great fun, with some real decisions, and feel very exciting. The hidden units mean there is a very nice fog of war effect. Thoroughly recommended for either experienced war gamers or someone completely new to the genre.

4.5 Rating after on play. Raised to 6 after 3 games. Really wanted to like this, but not as strong a game as Julius Caesar. Too much wristage in resolving battles...the opening moves capture the fog of war quite well, but once battle is joined it tends to be a slugfest. maybe this captures the key elements of the campaign, but there's other games I'd play over this any day.

I am giving this another go, but before further play will be copying up the map. The bluffing and movement before battle is joined are the strong points, the battle system seems a bit hit and miss.

Works best with three people, a rarity in games.

The map is overcrowded on the latest editions but does the job, simple without being simplistic. The battle mini game is welcome and works well, giving the feel that you are actually fighting battles. A good operational/tactical hybrid and introductory wargame.

Dicey. Cavalry is overpowered.

I was reluctant about adding yet another block war-game to my collection (Since I already have Sekigahara, Hammer of the Scots, and Julius Caesar), and while this game MIGHT still fill that same niche, I think it might be one of the strongest showings of the genre.

First off, the lack of cards is refreshing. I'm not finding myself milling through the deck looking for the one card I need to activate my troops. 

Secondly, the mini-map battles are where the actual meat of this game are. Cavalry (for once) actually feels like cavalry, while infantry has an entirely different feel.

Finally, the ability to play a block war-game 3-player is incredible. This is lighter than Guns of Gettysburg (which plays four) and the rules can be explained in just a few minutes.

Overall, this is a major win.

Bonus feature: The map in my edition (4th) is mounted. Traditionally, the maps for these block war-games are folded poster-board.

RATING: 8
First Impression: This is a good game to introduce players to napoleonics, block wargames, and wargames in general. The component quality is nice, although I've blown up the map to a more playable size. Although the game plays with 2, its one of the few (only) wargames I own that works well with 3 players. The conflict is presented well and the French have to solve the puzzle of trying to maneuver their army into a position to split the Allies. I love the Battleboard idea and the way the individual battles are played out in combat rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impression: Columbia has done it again with a game that has gorgeous components as well as tactical and strategic depth. Highlights of this edition include the introduction of battlefield terrain and reintroduction of horse artillery. Mobility and battlefield reinforcement are important strategic concerns for both commanders. This game is clearly as much about maneuver as it is about combat. I'm really looking forward to my next session of this wonderful game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite an intriguing block game, however, regardless of the strategy Nappy pursues, the game ends in a massive battle (likely to cause RSI in the wrist from dice rolling) which is usually determined by the "luck of the die" as there is normally little difference in the size of the forces involved.

RATING: 4
Played once as a 3-player game.  This was our first session of Napoleon so we opted for the Historical Deployment setup.  The other option is for players to choose their own starting locations (which I'd definitely push for if I ever have the option of playing Napoleon again.)  

Overall I enjoyed my first session of Napoleon.  It has peaked my interest in playing some of the newer, more complex block games, such as Europe Engulfed.  My experience with war games is rather limited, so I find myself comparing Napoleon with games that I know, such as Friedrich.  To be honest, I find Friedrich more entertaining for it supports up to 4 players and the game encourages table talk!  Napoleon on the other hand is much more introverted and puzzle-like, which I happen to love in Eurogames, but not so much in wargames.
   
The rules were also a little vague concerning Allied turn order, so we decided that the Allied players could talk amongst each other as to who would move first each turn.  Perhaps we Allies needed to decide turn order resolution during the initial setup for according to the rules, the Allied players are forbidden from communicating with each other except during Allied Night turns.

RATING: 5
Okay, it goes back to a 5 because it fell a bit flat with all of us.  I know there are more nuances, particular in the movement of forces prior to battles, than we have had a chance to experience.  But the battles themselves seem like dicefests where luck takes over, more or less, and we just sit back and scream or laugh or do both.  It was fun at first, but the fun does not last.  


-------------------------------------------------------
I also owned an AH edition of this game, and like so much from the past I can only ask, "where did it go?" I love block games and Columbia puts out an excellent product, but there are reasons that I am not keen on this game. One, Waterloo has been heavily saturated in books and games, yet I do not find it an especially interesting battle. Two, the map/board space in this version of the Waterloo campaign is much too cramped. I've never understood why, after so many years and so many complaints, Columbia has not made a larger playing surface. This problem was made more acute with the increase in the number of those wonderful wooden soldiers/blocks. I acquired my copy in a trade, and its former Geek owner took good care of it. Now it needs a home where it will feel loved. I may end up using it at school; my students will love it because, one, three people/teams can play it, and two, they will enjoy the tactical combat board (which is better than a straight "shoot-'em up/roll 'em dead" CRT, but only slightly).

Really good game.  Nice movement system coupled with wooden blocks (hiding force strength).  Battles are a roll fest, but you do get a strategic sense of the Waterloo campaign.  Unfortunately, the "winner" of the game is often determined by the bidding process at the beginning of the game and who will take which side.  Napoleon typically loses, and the outcome of the campaign is determined by how many points and the additional bid points from the game start.  Still, the battles can be rousing.

There are several problems with this version:  cavalry is too strong, it's too easy for the Allies to slow the French with single units, and the French are under too great a time constraint.

In my opinion, the definitive example of a "block game." Most current block games are played on a hexagon map, but Napoleon had an ingenious map wich restricted the number of troops you could move along roads and over bridges. That sort of elegant disntiction in movement rules that reflects an aspect of warfare during the period covered that is either dispensed with entirely, or buried under complex traffic flow rules (Wacht am Rhein comes to mind) in more modern games. The Allies have the hard job of massing the needed troops at the critical points at the right team, while the French race to deliver knockout blows to the Brits and Prussians before they combine. Great game!

This could be higher. The game is really cool, I really dig the blocks and the topic, but the map is way too small for all the blocks, it becomes really fiddly (ok, I printed out a poster-sized version of the map which works fine now, but this here is to rate the game that comes in the box.) Balance: I cannot win as the French, period. My opponent can neither. I don't know, maybe we miss something, but the game always eventually leads to a French defeat. Ok, this is Waterloo after all, but come on, give Nappy a break!

Wargame histórico sobre la campaña de los Franceses contra los Ingleses y Prusianos en bélgica.  Las unidades son cubos de madera, que se giran para indicar los daños. Los franceses tienen cinco días para concluir (cada día tiene tres turnos diurnos y uno nocturno). Por las noches, a menos que vaya lider, no hay marchas forzadas ni combates.
Las batallas se desarrollan en un mapa con tres flancos y reserva. Además, durante su desarrollo, pueden recibir refuerzos desde las ciudades adyacentes.
Tiene especial importancia dominar el transporte por carretera, que está sometido a ciertos límites, lo que provoca que haya que pensar muy bien los movimientos.
Es un juego entretenido y no demasiado largo. Refleja muy bien las batallas de la época.

Not too solitaire-friendly. The battle rules are REALLY hard to wrap my head around.

Nice game.  Quicker than Pacific Victory, and with fewer rules to remember (no weather, no initiative, simpler supply rules).  I like the idea of a battle board for combat resolution;  without this Napoleon would be quite boring I think as all battles would be to-the-death slugfests.

After the initial playing (Columbia)....

Like most Columbia games (although this game was published by others prior), I see it more as a puzzle than a simulation. Nothing wrong with that and this one in particular is closer to sim than most I feel. I like the battle board which allows players to make basic tactical decisions regarding flanks, centre and reserves. 

Nice components. Blocks not as pretty as with other games like HotS, C Rex, etc.. The map is a bit too small for the number of blocks in play, but that is not the end of the world. It can make it look a bit like a clash between Jenga towers.

My feel on balance in 4th edition is that it will be very hard for the French to win using the historical setup, but with free setup the game is much more interesting. Definitely use the free setup, maybe even in your first game :)
---
Since it looks like the three different version of the game have all been collapsed into one entry, here are a few comments on them:

1st & 2nd (Gamma Two, Avalon Hill): This is a really tight game with a fairly low block density. It's fast and unforgiving, but super-playable and only like 60 minutes. Hard on the French under the best of conditions, but if you get lucky on your force march die rolls, who knows! I'd probably rate this version an 8 or so; not high on my personal playlist anymore but it is a classic that I got a lot of mileage out of back in the day and has held up pretty well. It has the advantage of being pretty cheap on the secondary market (last I checked), and so good value.

3rd (Columbia): This is my least favorite of the three distinct versions; it's fine, just not as good as the other two. The high block density makes it feel like a bit of a slugfest, and the cavalry and square rules don't quite feel balanced correctly. I probably rate it a 6 or 7; it's OK, but with 4th edition available now, I don't think there is a lot of point to playing it in my opinion.

4th (Columbia Kickstarter): This is by far my favorite version of the game, and the one I rate a 10. With a block density between 1st & 3rd it's not quite as unforgiving as the original but retains its elegance. The terrain rules for battles are a really terrific addition to the system, and the rules for cavalry and squares finally work right. I think I respect the 1st/2nd edition more than I actually personally like it - 4th edition is much more in my personal sweet spot. Plus it still only takes 90 minutes to play, and works quite well for three (the original edition worked for 3, but wasn't great).

Brilliant design, one of the cleanest and most efficient wargames ever made.  My first block game.  I simplified the combat rules, made a one page reference chart, and expanded the map.  You need to have a passion for the subject to really find this exciting though.

After "falling in love" with Hammer of the Scots, I sought to play other block games. Napoleon was SUCH a disappointment, I have to say. Battle boards and everything... It strikes me as not having aged well. Game design simply has tremendously improved over the past decades. I wonder whether many of the above ratings rely to no little extent on the nostalgia factor.

Anyway, not for me...

Avalon Hill version.  Napoleon is a pretty good light wargame, but I have a few problems with it:
-it seems there are usually only a few very large battles.
-combat takes too long w/lots of dice.  
-there seems to be an optimal allies strategy that all but guarantees a victory.
It's still fun, but I just wish I could come up with some good variants to fix these problems.

Fourth edition of this classics. IMO best edition so far. Nice mix of fast, easy to learn and playable game with decent amount of operational/tactical puzzles. Luck factor is needed, especially on French side, which has initiative but must act quickly and taking the risk of force marching.
Good replay and balance value. Very good game.

2014-11-28: I played this game at BGG Con 2014 using the triple-blind rules from the Kickstarter edition.  It was awesome, but there was a significant amount of downtime for the Allied players when not engaged with France.  We all agreed that a double-blind game might be more engaging.  We all agreed that we liked the battle system and the game played quickly.  This one might become a con staple.  I particularly enjoyed the terrain rules, making every battle a bit different and gave each player a little more to think about than just matching up blocks against one another.  Thanks Columbia for this game - it has withstood the test of time for a reason, and I think this faster-playing 4th edition is really top notch.

RATING: 8
10 plays... Nail biter! (Note to self ALWAYS when Nappy: less dawdling for croissants, more speed!) Every move a mistake, but you have to move... The setup and road limits lead to a surprising filtering puzzle--with a bit of eurogame-puzzle feel. In contrast, the dice rolling is oldschool wargamey, but the tactical mini-board still seems so innovative to me (and fun). I love how the strategic decisions directly impact the tactical. It comes down to a handful of battles. Time is not Napoleon's friend here. Some tactical battle rules nuances take some effort to work out (see my player aid pdf on unit behaviors). I was surprised (impressed) how quick the game could be, and how much I could feel this to be a sister game of Quebec (good, good). The Frenchies and the Allies have such opposite advantages and disadvantages, with the burden on Nappy. Tactical battles are juicy with many nervous choices to make! [What Niko Ruf says in his review of Bobby Lee applies here too: "Fighting has a strategical dimension (how to get the most units there quickly), a tactical dimension (how to maneuver), and a risk-management dimension (when do I fight?)"] Typically takes less than 2 hours to play.  1977 version. PS: Another bonus is that as Napoleon I riled Deivida so much that she called me quite dirty names at the pub.

The production value is medium. Years ago I played an earlier edition that had a mounted map, stenciled blocks, there were 3 different colors of blocks (red for British, Green for Germans, and blue for the French), and a bookshelf box.  This edition is a big dissapointment.  The box is a sleeve over a plain white cardboard box (like a postal shipping box).   The blocks are all stickered.  There were two shades of blue for two of the armies...much too close in color. Finally, the map is not mounted and flimsy.  The rule book wasn't even stapled together.  This was like a home made game!!!

Napoleon is one of two wargames I've played much of in the past few years. I find it strategically interesting, although I wish that it had more tactical variety (as mass dice-rolling can be tedious, especially when triple-6s or snake eyes can just kill a superior tactical play). I've had good luck winning as the French, although I believe that to be because I've been playing with players with much less gaming experience (plus some unutterably good luck); it is my opinion that the Allies have an advantage. Compared to A House Divided (my other much-played wargame) I feel that the strategic feel of Napoleon is better, but A House Divided conjures up its historical period more accurately for me at least. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
See my review here on BGG.  Outstanding game of Napoleon's attempt to defeat the Prussian and Anglo-Allied armies in June of 1815.  Chess like in the need to think ahead two moves and visualize how the Main Board might look at that point.  Plays very quickly.  Very easy to learn, but deep enough that it will challenge you to master the nuances of road movement, force concentration, and deception.

Block Frenzy begins here folks...this is not only one of the finest wargames ever produced, but one of the best board games period.  A clever, ingenious system that manages to hit the sweet spot of playability and historical detail, Napoleon is a great introduction to wargames for the casual boardgamer.  The strategies and tactics available are rich but not obtuse, and even an amateur Wellington can bring Napoleon to his knees with well-timed, orchestrated attacks and counterattacks.  A true classic, and it's a great foundation for later games like Hammer of the Scots.

The game really captures the feel of road movement and concentration of force. I'm not sure you can really model the campaign exactly, but that's a minor point for me given that this is a quick, fun and very re-playable game. My only issue is with the tactical battles, which go on too long, and which aren't nearly as much fun as all the pre-battle maneuvering (hmmm . . . maybe like real life).

After a couple plays of the 2nd edition, it's decent. You have some interesting decisions to make both in terms of placement and force composition. But, at the end of the day, it's a lot of hit-on-a-six die rolling. The battle matrix is kinda cool, I'll give it that.

Though it's a bit too light for my tastes these days, I'd still play it once in a while if someone's eager to play and I'm in the mood for a light Napoleonics game. Maybe I should try the 4th edition to see if I like it better.

Update: Acquired the 4th edition. Let's see how it goes.

Nice distillation of the essentials of the Hundred Days campaigns. The use of blocks in this campaign and detail level is inspired as players feint and try and guess where the main blow will strike. The road net and its rules create a great feeling of maneuver and blocking and the battleboard is heaps of fun.

RATING: 5
[Dagliesh] While this older block game has some good features, I am not one of its fans. It is a dry maneuver-fest of hauling your units to just the right regions and whittling down your opponent at the "right" river. Has many many good points though: fog-of-war, tactical battles on a mini-mat, specialized units, fast play time, and it accomodates a third player in a pinch. But with the existance of HotS, this feels very... static and all about min-maxing. Still, you can line up your dudes, roll'em into Belgium, pow! knock 'em down for a fast yet tactical game.

Simple, fast and satisfying game.  As simple as it is, it places a premium on military strategy proper: forcing for a battle at the time and place of your choosing, with the material advantage on your side, with the object of victory in sight, against an enemy who is trying to do the same to you.

Really enjoy the Avalon Hill version.  I think I have every edition going back to Gamma Two and there has been some fiddling with road capacities, which do change the flow of the games significantly.  

The latest edition from Columbia is an extreme remake with more blocks and more turns.  I may grow to love it too, but for now the Avalon Hill version is preferred.

Ingenious block system creates a high amount of tension for the players as the game takes on almost chess-like precision, despite the fog of war.  Should one force-march the troops and risk losing strength points to straggling?  How should one array the army for the battles?  Great deal of pressure on the French to win, but the Allies have their hands full trying to unite the Anglo-Allied and Prussian armies to make full use of their numerical superiority.  Fast playing and completely engrossing.  Highly recommended and one of my favorite block games of all time.

Columbia, third edition.   I love this classic battle game!  Each side gets a pile of blocks and It's really about managing the merging of the armies.  It feels dated in a way since each side has ton of units and they are ground down through an endless series of six sided dice rolls looking for ones and twos.  It can be overwhelming when trying to form a plan when you first look at all the blocks and many a dice must be tossed before it's over.  However, on the good side the map is a hand drawn thing of beauty with an old world look and pen and ink line work.  I have it enlarged and mounted in a poster frame on my wall.    It's also cool because each battle is fought on a battle board which is a 'zoom in' of the larger map and lets you charge, retreat and reinforce in detail.  This makes combat feel controlled rather than an abstracted CRT result.  Another thing I like is the lack of points to heal or repair any of your blocks.  You start the game at max strength and the battles wear you down throughout the game.  It makes you aware that you are spending your armies strength, even in battles you win.  It has fog of war, great bits and a beautiful point to point map.  

Note: I liked it enough to pick up the old Avalon Hill version which has fewer blocks, shorter playtime and mounted map (with lesser artwork).  I will update when it hits the table.

(Columbia edition) Not even close to the brilliance of Wizard Kings and Hammer of the Scots. Degenerates into a massing of troops culminating in a huge schmozz.

I have played both and definitely 4th edition is much better than 3rd one. With less units and less movements the game is improved and maneuver has more importance.

I like the addition of terrain blocks to the 4th edition, a simple rule that works fine.

Third Edition

A tense operational treatment of the Waterloo Campaign, that captures the situation without much fuss. I prefer the third edition since it looks better and includes more blocks, and thus gives you the margin of error Wellington and Blucher needed in order to win. I'll gladly take the clutter of the map to have this option.

Second edition

A classic but with so few blocks things are bit too determined by just one battle. That is on;y Napoleonic if a person only knows about the big battles and not the smaller actions that proceeded battle such as Austerlitz and Friedland.

RATING: 5
A weird, somewhat clunky block game on a topic that has never interested me very much. My view is that Napoleon is an awkward intermediate step between the early, streamlined Gamma Two block games (Quebec 1759, War of 1812), and the more simulationist early Columbia block games (Rommel in the Desert, Eastfront). While there is tactical interest here, the situation doesn't seem very subtle strategically. The French are almost forced to blitz Liege and then deal with the English. I think part of the problem is the simplistic victory condition: the French must destroy both opposing armies. [Comments refer to the Gamma Two / Avalon Hill version of the game. I've never played the expanded Columbia version from 1993.]

Based on one play. 

From the rules I didn't understand how fast and immediate this game really is. 8o

You have to pick your battles as they may be your undoing. 
There's a lot of strategy in thinking where to deploy and with what. The battle system is pretty straightforward but it has narrative and tension. 

Repeated plays will be necessary to rate it higher.

UPDATE
Played it again with the 4th ed. Now this game captures the capital importance of manoeuvre in the period. Units are frail and once committed they can wear down due to attrition pretty fast, this makes for high stakes and careful planning even if you really cannot plan everything and you need to work on your "hunch" for the battle. 

In effect the "reinforcement" mechanic makes this so historically situated as units will move towards "the sound of the cannon" and unique and apart from any other block game design out there. 

I agree with some reviewers when they say that this is a classic wargame and should be in anyone's collection.

I have the 1977 second edition of this game and I love this game. This game is nice and simple and has a different feel to it because you are moving town to town by roads. I love the "chess" aspect of the moving of groups. Battle resolution isfun as well. I like it so much that it has ruined me for virtually every other Napoleon game out there. There are many more games that are deeper, bigger, more rules heavy, but I have not found one as fun for me.

Own both the 2nd and 4th editions. The game system and the artwork are both significantly improved in the 4th edition.

A great campaign level game on the situation in June 1815. The battle system gives a good feel for the period with the different combat capabilities of the units. Need to play more to see if the results of the battle system are generally in line with what would have likely occurred historically in a given battle.

RATING: 6
Okay: Operational - Napoleonic - Easy

Good:
-Original take on Napoleonic Manouvring
-Simple, yet a lot of tough decisions
-great strategic depth
-Accessible

Minus:
-Map too small. Nice looking but should have bene twice the size
-Too many blocks, mainting corps integrity is a really messy and on a cramped map this is really an issue.
-Prone to analysis paralysis; all the time calculating how many blocks have used the roads and how to ptimize it can take a lot of time.
-Not convinced about the battle boards system
-I am not fond of the road connection map. I prefer hexes or areas.

The game is turn based but woul in fact be more interesting when issueing orders and movement is done parralel.
I guess the Avalon Hill version is better suitable for this type of game due to fewer amount of blocks.

If you don't have the time or brain for the Kevin Zucker stuff, this is a welcome fun and playable game. Amazingly interesting depiction of the original situation. This is a super dooper simplified Napoleonic manouvring game and that is what is what all about at the time. Absolutely timeless and to me a true classic that should be in any game collection. Can be played with three and is an interesting gateway game.
An old game with a lovely classic fell and adorable gameplay. Meanwhile overtaken by Hammer and Crusader Rex.

A tad too simplistic and the battle system isn't fun. 

Sold it.

I don't see how with two equally good players Napoleon could win. Sure it would be historical, but can be quite off-putting if you know you're going to loose from the very start.

Both players maneuvre a lot, Napoleons only chance is if the allies will make a mistake, then he might have a shot at winning.

Other than that, map & components are very beautiful.

Based on one solo play, so likely to change as played more- an older block game offering which moves quickly and which I have not yet gotten the full hang of by any means.

I can see it rewards planning and backup, as well as a more cautious approach by the Allies when setting up!

Quick, not too much AP, even with a game very new to me, and lots of interesting decisions regarding when/where to stand for battle and where retreat is wiser. (Neither turned out too well for the Brits and Germans in my 1st game.)

AH version:  Venerable wooden block game on the Waterloo campaign.  The French player tries to quickly beat the British and Prussians (played by one or two players) before they unite their strength against him and time runs out.  Typical point-to-point operational system combined with an interesting battle-board tactical system, which works very well except for horse artillery which act like attack helicopters.  The problem with the game is that the operational system is far too sluggish to reproduce historical events; neither the French advance nor the Allied reaction can be recreated by the game.

A nice intro war game.  With only 1 play under my belt, I'll need more tries to kick the tires.  I really like the 3 column combat system. The fact that it plays pretty quickly is also very nice in a wargame.  The 'historical' setup might become scripted after repeated plays, but you can alter the starting positions so that's good.  All in all, a fun play.

RATING: 9
The 2nd edition of this game - published in the late 1970s by Avalon Hill - was my first exposure to block games and I was completely hooked ever since.  This game uses simple, elegant mechanics and the fog of war engendered by the blocks to full effect.  Plays quickly with a lot of rich strategic decision-making and equally rich tactical play.  While a far &quot;lighter&quot; treatment of the campaign than many other wargamers, the game scale and theater represented by the mapboard does the Waterloo campaign better justice than most of the game&#039;s competitors.  And what this game does that none of the others do is really put you in the general&#039;s tent.  A battleboard is used to resolve major battles and it provides a satisfying finale to the big shoot-out that almost always comes in this game.  I would give it a 10 except (1) the mapboard is simply too small given the number of blocks, and (2) the 2nd edition of the game is perhaps a better &quot;game&quot; but somewhat less better a simulation than this one.  I&#039;d give 2nd edition that &quot;10&quot;

Great components with (gasp) great gameplay. Strategic tension, tactical tension. Horrible luck can hurt enjoyment, but it&#039;s not a long game so the pain doesn&#039;t last long. Also, even though it&#039;s fairly simple as war games go, this isn&#039;t a non-gamers game. (Tip: The French MUST force march or they&#039;ll face a combined army (and lose).)

You could say, 'It's the polar opposite of the Columbia Version' and that would be high praise indeed.
The seed was one of the three earliest Block Games I believe (1759/1812).
AH and some D. Greenwood added to T. Dagliesh's early Masterpiece.
The transition from 2nd ed. (AH) to 3rd ed. (CG) somehow
brings to mind the scene from the movie 'THE FLY' when during the teleportation, everything got 'screwed up'.

Ignore my previous comments - this is a fantastic game.  It's all about the setup and then it's about rolling alot of 6s.  I still wouldn't want to play every week but once every couple of years will be anticipated.

I want to like this game more.  Its a fairly simple and accessible block game.  However, the game always seem to end up in a big scrum.  Essentially, its a period of jockeying for relative position and then having the "big battle" and feeding reinforcments.  Its great once but repeated plays into the same situation have left me cold towards the game.

RATING: 7
Block game pioneer.  I have doubt to the overall effect on the feel of the Napoleonic battles though.  How the effects of supply, tactical formation and weather can be handled by a block game? Going to kickstart the 5th edition. Very nice box cover.  I have been into block games for several games - from the early Hammer of the Scots, the excellent Eastfront, historical Hellenes, to the epic Julius Caesar, my interest level in block games has gone up quite considerably.  This brings me back to this game, watching for a potential game with the Chairman of the local gaming society. I can't say all of them are good, mainly due to some historicity limitation on the block game design premises. However, the block game system seems to simulate the strategies on a grand scale quite well.  As some reviews here in BGG pointed out, this game didn't feel much like Napoleonic warfare.  With the lame Athens & Sparta game, I should approach Waterloo with caution. Nonetheless, this is the kind of sacred game that you ask yourselves a thousand times whether you need another Waterloo game, and that one you would still let loose your purse in the end.

RATING: 3
Looks great, and I'm sure makes for a tense game if you're willing to ignore that the dynamics fly in the face of history, but unfortunately it's not a representation of the Waterloo campaign as we know it.  Where the 1st and 2nd edition made the Allies too slow to react, here they are too fast - if using the historical deployment, the French will quickly see themselves blocked in Charleroi by both concentrated Allied armies. In a game where the attacker will generally have to slowly bring all his units into the fight, that means deadlock. As a result, historically sound strategies are doomed and the players will have to invent others - surely tense but not the Hundred Days from our universe. A fantasy game played on a beautiful Waterloo campaign map with Waterloo campaign pieces.  For a quick Hundred Days fix, play AH's Hundred Days Battles instead.

Tentative rating after 1 game (Columbia Games version).

I don't normally rate a game after a single play, but I had a grand time playing this, even though I lost the game as the French at Waterloo.  The combination of short, simple rules, the chess-like operational game, and the tense, sometimes wild tactical game work together beautifully.  I can't wait to play this game again.

I've tried to take into account the "newness" factor (I'd like to rate the game a 9) in my initial rating, but I fully expect that I'll continue to enjoy the game and that the final rating will be either 8 or 9.

The game plays fairly quickly and feels  pretty light, and going with that it did feel like luck is a strong factor (not the driving factor, but some unlucky rolls can really cost you). I am not sure how I feel about the Battle board yet as our game only had one huge battle, but I did like how it gives more opportunity for maneuver and decisions.

RATING: 6.5
This has a lot going for it and feels like its on the verge of being great (the battles in particular are very tense) but the rules are so badly written with so many holes that I would be unlikely to play it again. This is the 3rd edition of a really really simple game, we shouldnt need to make this many rules assumptions.
The "3 player" rules are a bit of a joke , they make so little sense that the designers clearly never even tried to play it with 3 before writing the rule.

RATING: 7
This seems to have aged amazingly well. It's got a real chess-like feel of manoeuvre on the main board as well as separating strategy and tactics nicely and offering a good sense of Napoleonic small unit tactics during battles. Simple to learn and plays in an hour or two, and makes good use of the hidden information on the blocks. What's not to like? Well, feels like a real uphill struggle for the French and can make you work hard to figure out pointless nonsense like trying to circumvent the road limits before the dice kick you in the teeth. But still.

I grew up playing Avalon Hill wargames and bookshelf classics. This AH edition game got (and still gets) a lot of play. One of my first experiences with a "lighter" wargame. In it's time, this was the first "block" game and was unique. It is a 9 for me because of my memories playing it, and because many who still play it with me enjoy wargames as well as "German" style games. Unless I am mistaken, this was the first "block" game with hidden unit capabilities and turn the block for step reduction. It is a dice fest to some degree, and my rating is influenced by my fond memories. But what better reason for a 9?

RATING: 5.5
This was the first time I've played a real wargame, and I think it's a really suitable introduction to the subset for a noob like myself.  The movement, combat, and eventually strategy become evident after a few minutes of play.  The self-decided placement method seems stacked in the Allies' favour, but is a great way to introduce new wargamers to the mechanics.  Historical layout places actual importance to the limitations, making general strategy MUCH more important!

Columbia Games 3rd edition:

Fast playing introductory level block game with a 3 player option.  Haven't played nearly enough to form an opinion regarding play balance.  Plays fast and I enjoy the tactical battleboard elements.

The map is really a bit small at times to accommodate the heaps of blocks, needs to be about 50% larger.

Definitely worth trying out if you like block games.

This is a really well designed game. The wooden counters are a big +! Combat is well done (right center left flanks, reserves). An innovative and simple hidden unit system. There are many innovative elements to this game - it's a must buy if you can find a copy.

This block game ended up being less fun than it could have because of the confusing battle rules.  After reading the many rules clarification posts on BGG, we still felt like we were conducting the battles wrong.  It seems like the new version of this game has polished the rules from this 1977 classic, which might make it a better copy to have and play.

RATING: 8
I really like this little block war game.  Again, I find that it's not the war game theme that I don't like - in fact I really enjoy games about war quite a bit.  Give me a game with tons of chits and charts, and I'll probably fall asleep before I get through the rulebook.  But a nice easy war game like this, that hits the spot just right.  This is the second block game I've played - the first was Hammer of the Scots which I didn't like so much, but I enjoy this one quite a bit.

*UPDATE* 4th Edition was a lot of fun. We played our initial meatgrinder battle without the morale rules, but at least the game gave us a flavor of the campaign. I liked it. 


Played 3rd edition, which was quick, but one or two lopsided battles decided things in an unpleasant way (aside, of course, from my own unpleasant loss.)  Too much AP regarding roads and the game has not aged well, methinks.

Will try 4th edition to see if that's an improvement.

Very tense game. Plays in about an hour and has lots of replayability due to different approaches. The maneuvering on the map is a little chess-like, while the battles can be pretty chaotic. Still, there is a lot you can do to improve (or ruin!) your chances of winning on the battleboard. The only rules change I would recommend is making "picketing" tactics more costly (see my post in the variant rules section).

Give it a second try or trade away? We'll see what happens first.

I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. But it all works fine in this game hence the rating.

Napoleon:  Waterloo is a great classic that has been reprinted several times over the decades.  Perhaps the best of all block war games published by Columbia Games. The game mechanics is light to moderate for a war game.  In its 4th edition, the tactical battles are much battle with more fog of war mechanisms  and terrain features that are randomly drawn to create more drama,.  The game needs a bigger board as the army blocks, which are larger than in previous editions and  makes the board appear cluttered.  a great game for light war-gamers, buy it!

My favorite block game, by far. And I've played all the GMT's and Columbia's. This elegant game has everything you need for 3 players.  A masterpiece which I have been playing for more than 25 years.  You can usually balance in a new player with no problem.  Though the rules are not long, there are hundreds of nuances here and the learning keeps me coming back.  We often play three games in a row.  The finest example of the almost seemless streamlining of tactics and strategy that I know.  No wonder there are 3 editions, but the second is definitely the best!

This rating is for the older Avalon Hill version. This game has it all - Easy to set up, easy to teach, compelling play and can be easily finished in an evening. Actually, you can play it twice in an evening and switch sides. I've never been a fan of block games but this one is the exception because it is actually fun to play. I docked it a couple of points because while you can play it solitaire, you miss a lot of what makes this game so much fun.

My first true wargame which I bought while at college in Waterloo, just a mile north of the battlefield and I played a lot of this in lunchbreaks as it can be finished in under an hour. One of the very few wargames to successfully combine strategy and tactical systems as you manoeuvre blocks on the campaign map and fight out combat on battlesheets with three columns, a reserve and reinforcements. One player controls the French army and the other 1-2 players the Anglo-Dutch and Prussians. There are a variety of strategies, thanks to a free set up by both sides and the French decision as to advance on the left against Wellington, right against Blucher or straight done the middle.

One of the earliest block games, and still one of the best. I prefer the second edition, with its clean graphics imprinted on the blocks and reduced chrome in the game system. There is enough chance (die rolls) so you can blame your luck if you lose - but there are so many die rolls that it should average out - if not in one game, at least over several. The challenge for both sides is concentrating your forces while bringing your opponent to battle = or avoiding battle while your forces are dispersed. I learn more about the game every time I play - recently, it has been the value in delaying the enemy's rout.

A good indroductary block wargame, plays quickly but gives you quite a bit of strategic options. It does a good job of capturing the fell of the historical situation without a lot of overhead.
It has a combination of operational movement, where I liked the concept of limited group moves to represent command control and the limitations forced by the road net. 
The block system provides a good fog of war.
The tactical situation can ba a real crap as you watch you best laid plans go astray

My first try on block games: very good impression, the wood blocks are nice to see and when you look at them gathered in a single big group really give the feel of a huge fearsome army. I was very pleased by tactical deployment on  side mini-map with the left-center-right columns to resolve combat (the most enjoyable part of the game). Tried with historical setup, probably after first play is better use the free setup.
 On the bad notes: the map is under sized for the number of blocks stackable in a single point/city.

I love this game, easy to learn, easy to play, and lots of fun.  And one of the best parts is that one can play in an hour or so.  This was my second Columbia block game purchase many years ago.  Upgraded my rating based on 4th Edition.  The revised art, slightly larger map, smaller number of blocks and terrain all add up to a better game.  This classic is still one of my favorites.

I haven't figured this game out yet. There seems to be a lot of luck involved (too much), as the battles are just huge dice rolling orgies. I'm sure there is more strategy to this but I would have to play this more often to say for sure. The trouble is, I haven't found this to be very much fun. Solitaire suitability is low. Love the history though.

Have the AH Edition. Napoleon is a very light wargame IMO. The movement rules are simple and easy to use (8 Units across a thick line, 6 across a thin line. Unless the line crosses a river, then movement is halfed.) And the combat is only a little bid harder to grasp. (Having to do with the columns and movement within the battle). Also, its a block game, so thats pretty sweet also.

RATING: 9
The best of the Columbia Games block wargames, IMO. We used to love to play this one back when we were all addicts of "The Game". This was filler for us in those days!

The allies must coordinate well to defeat France's larger force. But there's a catch in the 3-player version: the allies can't communicate except on certain night turns. Napoleon must be careful not to split his forces and be taken out piecemeal. 

Can the British use their edge in cavalry to win a decisive early battle? Can the Prussians force march their solid infantry and artillery forces into the fray in time? All sorts of possibilities make for a satisfying and challenging reenactment of the final campaign of the Napoleonic wars.

You look at the rules, and think "this is supposed to be historical?"  
And then you play -- and it works.  Best of the light-rule block games, and a great feel for the operational and tactical problems of the times.  
The first edition has half the units of the 2nd and 3rd editions, and has less flexibility and replay value.
The most recent update on the third edition rules is the best set for play.*

*It now looks like the 4th edition may be the definitive version.

A period in history I am really interested in.  A relatively light block wargame than has a number of tactical permutations that are interesting.  An easy game to get into and plays relatively fast. The blocks and foil stickers are excellent, I like the look of the map but functionally I am annoyed with it.  I kickstarted this expecting a mounted board and received a cardboard map, that doesn't sit completely flat!  I'm dumbfounded that after the 4th edition they still have [b]blocks that are too big for the board, creating an unwieldy experience in what should have been an excellent production.[/b]  This could have been a 9 for me but comes in at 7 because of this major flaw.

Neat block game.  I have both the Avalon Hill and Columbia Games versions, both good, but the Columbia version adds a whole lot with more blocks and a few changes to the rules.

Great play that makes you want to play again and again.

Nice simple rules.  Nice battle system.  Interesting assymetrical struggle, with the smaller French army having to capture Brussels or Ghent in order to knock out the Brits before attrition sets in.  But I think that the piece count on the new version is too high - the map isn't large enough to cope, so you tend to get a mass of pieces in the British sector.

Another classic from Columbia Games. 

Block wargame that follows in the footsteps of Quebec and War of 1812 from Columbia. One of the originals!

Unlike those others, the tactical battle resolution has been kicked up a notch. The new (4th) edition comes with battle boards depicting left, right, center, and reserves. The battle then takes place in actual space, with the goal to break through any of the enemy front positions, which routes that army. I haven't played the predecessor games, but from what I understand this is a natural evolution of the simpler 3-column tactical battle resolution system used in those games (I could be wrong) and Napoleon allows for movement between positions. So battles are true mini-games that involve maneuver.

The 4th edition also includes random terrain modifiers that add some real twists to this otherwise simplistic tactical simulation. Terrain blocks are chosen at random and players get to position them, which is a nice representation of choosing ground, but with the ground at your choice being a bit beyond your control. There is no combat initiative rating, just firepower rating and strength which determine what you need to roll to hit and how many dice you can roll when you fire (a quantity which will decrease as the unit takes losses).

The real game, though, is at the operational level. Aside from the more involved battle resolutions, Napoleon is quite different from the newer Hammer of the Scots type system found in Crusader Rex, Julius Caesar, and Richard III. There are no cards; movement allowances are still impulse-based, but are fixed per turn. It's point to point, with no capacity limits in locations, but with capacity limits for moving across individual major/minor roads.

This is one of the only Columbia Games to have a "mounted board". Was super excited about this... but when I saw what they considered to be a "mounted board" I was disappointing. Why is this so hard for them to get right? It's a big upgrade compared to the card-stock maps of the other games, but it's not a thick, hard mounted board like any other game I own. It's got an almost semi-glossy finish to it (which is kind of nice, I think), but the material is... I don't even know what it is, but it's flimsy and cheap feeling compared to other games. Columbia should be careful... their games are much loved, but more and more gamers (especially new ones) are going to demand the same quality that is being put out by others. 

But, I can overlook that for now. I can also admit that the small storage profile of Columbia games is nice. All their boxes are the same size and shape and fit nicely on a standard bookshelf, resulting in a beautiful display that fits in any living room. Unlike the larger footprint, differently shaped boxes of so many other games (even from the same publisher). So, kudos there.

This is a great game! Even with continuing annoyance about components, I'm very glad to own it. Napoleon may even be becoming my favorite.

RATING: 5
Played against a friend using his copy. Its an OK game for use after any 'main event' game. To me it seemed like Draughts meets Risk with some extra more interesting rules bolted on. Entertaining enough for a very occassional play, but not one I'd personally buy. The different battles using the terrain blocks kept it amusing enough so as not to dread any endless sequence of vanilla featureless battles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
For the 1977 Avalon Hill game: really wonderful and tense.  For such a small board there are plenty of strategic opportunities, and the separate battle map adds a great balance to the game--one's carefully plotted zero-chance strategy on the main board affects and is affected by the chaos of battle on the battle board.  We found the battle rules to be a bit too obtuse at first, and I can see numerous advantages to more units (which come with later editions), but this game is historically excellent, very tense, and very fun.

Avalon Hill version.  My first impression is that this game is perfect for me, even though I am far from a Napoleonics enthusiast.  I hesitated to purchase it because I play 90% of my games solo.  When I heard this wasn't bad solitaire, I purchased it.  It is wonderful.  It feels like chess in the movement phase and like a dice fest in the battle phase.  There are surprises and heroics.  There is elegence and depth.  The feel of the game is somehow at once frantic and cerebral.  The components are a perfect match to the subject matter--real elegence and old world charm.  And it plays so fast.  So fast.

Nice smaller block-game, and the battleboard adds lots of fun to the battles.

One negative point is the too small map and battleboards - both get really crowded as large armies move around and fight - the game could certainly have benefitted from a larger map and larger battleboards.

Ordered from Columbia Games June 19th, 2016, received June 28th, 2016. I also purchased the extra dice pack from Columbia Games and they added 2 extra red dice, giving me a total of 6 dice in each of the 3 colours, red [British], black [Prussian], blue [French]. I found this game to be simply amazing. The board is outstanding and is an operational map of the Waterloo are of France and Belgium. When a non-Skirmish combat occurs, the blocks are move red to a tactical battle board. This is a mighty fine block game. The only thing I'd say was a negative is the board is slightly too small and the blocks can get bunched up at times. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Napoleon system is similar to parts of Quebec 1759 (combat in columns) and War of 1812 (map of cities with point-to-point movement). Napoleon improves the combat in columns by developing it more fully into an enjoyable mini-game, however the map is not big enough to accommodate large masses of blocks. 

Advice #1 - Never defend, always attack. Advice #2 - Watch out for the Cavalry!

Napoleon's last defeat at the hands of the Duke of Wellington in the Battle of Waterloo. A block war game with French, Prussian, and Anglo-Dutch units. Can force march. Cool "lose a step" option. Infantry and artillery blocks are rotated to show current strength. Travel mostly by road. No night engagement. Combat is done on a separate battle board which is setup with alternating player placement of terrain obstacles. Cannot move laterally, go through the reserve area in flank to move units left center or right. Check for French occupation of the three supply towns at Ghent, Brussels, and Liege. I'm told this could be a good entry level "real" board game because it has comparatively fewer rule exceptions.

RATING: 8
Columbia block games can be broadly swept into three categories: the classics from the 1970s and 1980s (e.g, Quebec 1759, War of 1812, Rommel in the Desert), the resurgence in the 1990s (e.g., Eastfront, Bobby Lee, Victory), and the modern era from 2001-present (Hammer of the Scots, Liberty, Crusader Rex, and all subsequent releases).  Napoleon 1815, having been initially released in the 1970s, falls into the first category.  Consequently, Napoleon doesn't possess any of the features associated with modern block games, such as card-driven group activations, card events, or A/B/C combat initiative ratings.

Napoleon's combat engine is a crafty reimagining of Quebec 1759's three-column deployments - the catch being that (a) units can travel inside and between the three columns and (b) different unit types (artillery, cavalry, infantry, leaders) have unique abilities related to their "to hit" numbers and column movements.  It's a wonderful historically-ground system that was celebrated in its time and holds up well against newer combat procedures.

Napoleon 3rd edition is significantly different from previous versions in that specific units can no longer be targeted in combat, horse artillery as a unit type has been eliminated, and the total number of units (overall) has been dramatically increased.  Hand in hand with these changes, however, is a concern that cavalry in the latest version - and perhaps in previous versions - may be overpowered.

Played this many times in my earlier years.  Easy game to learn and every game was enjoyable.

Nice playable block game, but you REALLY need an enlarged map!

Picked this up because I wanted to check out a Columbia block game, but one that was slightly less historically obscure than Quebec or 1812.  Also satisfied my desire to get a Napoleonic wargame.

RATING: 5
This game positively surprised me. The day and night phases make movement a bit harder to plot out, and the battle boards are a great addition to the regular Columbia Games block war games system. The theme doesn't quite tickle my fancy, but this made me want to try Columbia's Civil War titles.

First edition; easy rules, fast to play and very clever game mechanics. Buy it if you can.

More than 30 years later, still one of the best (light) wargames ever.

After 1 Play: I don't have much wargame experience, but this game just seemed odd to me.  Too much luck to be very strategic, and the weird split between movement and battles really killed any feeling of 'simulation'.

RATING: 7
Good game. Simple, but worthwhile. It has a strategic feel to it, but is still very simple. The choices are a little bit limited in the end.

The new version was not necessarily better than the old one. Just more blocks and a map that got cluttered.

[4th edition]
Emphasis is on maneuver, as it should be. Slight aversion to block games takes it down a notch, so take my rating with a grain of salt.

8/9/13 - 3 plays.  You can generally count on 40ish year old games that are still in production to deliver.  Napoleon's pretty good, though not stellar.  It did spawn a whole genre of games, however, and it does a lot of things right.  It's definitely worth trying out.

So glad I picked this up on Kickstarter

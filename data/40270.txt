It's alright for a CCG/LCG, but using a similiar system as Game Of Thrones and Warhammer:Invasion, and when I think about it...why would you bother if you can just play them? 
I LOVE the Cthulhu Mythos...but this one drags on a bit...

A well thought out strategy card game.

A little over-complex and over-long for my preference - only played it a few times, so may require a few more plays to evaluate properly.

The complexity does however make it difficult to second guess/calculate permutations of your opponents actions which leads toward a heightened sense of tension throughout the game.

Rating based on first play.  The learning curve is flat.  I like the possibilities of exploring the decks and learning more how the cards interact.  I like the system from what I saw.
The only negative is that it is less Ameri-Trashy than I expected.  The theme is not as strong as I thought.  The plastic is awesome, but non-functional, and it's not any more random than a Euro that uses cards.  In fact, you plan your plays much like a Euro (no randomness to foil your plans).  But I have a decent amount of Eur-tolerance, so it will sit better with me than a hard core AT'er.

This is a typical LCG game based on H.P. Lovecraft's horror universe where the mythical monsters clash with the earthly investigators. Each side is trying to win at least so called adventures in order to win. The gameflow itself is as used to be with LCG's: drawing cards, playing cards, committing. The main difference is that you have to build up resource piles in order to build much more powerful monsters or humans (that is instead of collecting money).

Typical FFG: so rich with theme that there's no game left. Not as bad as Battlestar Galactica, but close, since the light weight and simple mechanics just can't bear the burden of the theme. Fans of Lovecraft and non-fans who just want an interesting card game should look elsewhere.

This is my favorite LCG (although it is not "living" anymore - the cycle is complete, and that is a huge plus). I love the way resources work in this game (best of its kind imo).
beware, it IS a money sink. You will need two core sets and at least a few select box expansions to get this game running well. It is all worth it, though :)

An excellent LCG, though rather similar to Star Wars.

RATING: 5.5
Another disappointment from a designer that is well respected. May not be entirely his failure but more of MtG has done that and there is really nothing else to stand this game out except for the theme n the card art. 

Combine MtG mana to summon and blue moon card play, that's about it. 

The aspect of fighting at various struggle is the so called 'novelty' of the game. It makes the game play longer as both sides wait till one player do not have certain icons before moving in. Making this game quick to play because your opponent do not have the cards. Or drag on due to icon deficiency. 

A weak card game with strong theme and card art. 

The figurines are nice but completely not necessary to play. Does not bring out flavour but a sense of having 6 paper weights to use in the office.

As someone who plays MTG competitively, this game is a very big change of pace for me. The game is really deep. There are several interesting mechanics and games can take a while or be very quick. The resource system is unique and a good setup.

The best part though is being an LCG so once you find out what deck you want its easy to just get a couple of asylum packs. All of the newer ones come  with a full 3 copies of each card(max per deck) so 1 pack and your set.

Played this once, but I believe that I will really like it.  I like the theme (Cthulhu = cliche, I know...), I like Fantasy Flight's games, and I love card games.  So...this will probably become one of my newest obsessions once I play it more.

Just one play of this was a bit bewildering, and I wasn't really sure what the meat of the game was. Could certainly revise a lot up or down on future plays. Obviously deck-building is a big part of this, and I didn't get into that at all on first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Possibly the greatest tragedy of my collection. No matter how big a fan of H.P. Lovecraft I am (a huge one) I just cannot get into this game. For me the big problem is that I don't like that a deck can contain ancient one factions and human factions together. The theme just does not transfer well for me. Also all the ancient one factions seem much stronger than the human factions from every perspective, except the faction I care most about, Yog Sothoth, which is in my opinion the weakest in the game.

After playing an one-year RPG campaign of Call of Cthulhu (and reading tons of Lovecraft), my expectations were sky-rocketing. It turned out to be a magic: the gathering v.2, but with lesser fun and lesser options. No thematical value whatsoever. Depressing experience.

Am a big fan of HP Lovecraft. Tried hard to love this game, but it simply fell flat for my partner and I. Part of it was because of the lack of tension in this game. Most of the time you could determine the outcome before committing to any challenge, making most decisions "all or nothing" ones. 

I can see why some people would like it, but it didn't work for us.

Just to be clear, I only played the base game and have no idea if the expansions would make a difference.

RATING: 6
I quite don't see what's the big idea behind living card games. What I like about collectible card games is deckbuilding. With living card game you can't really build the deck unless you buy many expansions. I'd love to find a card game (living, collectible or whatever) that allows you to create your deck without buying expansions.

As a card game CoC is luck driven and there's possibility for a deadlock. AP is also a problem as the situations can get really complex. That having said I enjoy the theme. I just wish there was more choises in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just too complicated for what should have been a simple 2-players card game. Each round you have to fight it out in several different ways to see who the winner is. Just bogs down so fast. And why oh why did FantasyFlight put this game into one of their standard size boxes? It could have just as easy been fitted into a standard expansion size box.

The game conveyed no sense of story immersion in the Mythos universe; to bad, because I really wanted to like this game. Chaosium's Mythos game is far, far superior! On the plus side, the art and minis are beautiful; it's a shame the gameplay is so dry and boring. My Advice: get the Mythos CCG and you'll never look back.

I really love collectible card games for the way they play. I really hate them for the way they are marketed. The living card game system improves the ccg system by breaking away from the whole rarity and random card distribution.

Game plays quick and is therefore rather unforgiving when you have a bad start. I like the domain system where any card can become a resource. This adds some meaningful decisions to the game. Besides that most decisions seem obvious. Maybe this will change if I, and my opponents get to know the game better. Theme and components are very good, but that is to be expected of a Fantasy Flight Game.

Only the core leaves little to no room for deck building and making your own strategies. All your decks are highlander decks if you'll play with only the core set so it get's very luck based which I don't like that much.
Having to have to attach a good card as resource is simply annoying and frustrating... so I will go for the APs because this shall give you the room you need.
Beside these aspects it's still a good (core) game with a good mechanic behind it.
Love to play with APs!

To be updated.

Update #1: Played with Journey to unknown Kadath AP: 8/10

Update #2: With more than 1 AP you have lots of deck-building possibilities if you play with a mixed faction deck. Great! 9/10

This is not an easy game to get into.  The rules are bit obtuse and you will need to spend some decent money upfront before it becomes worthwhile.

Have only played a couple of times now so plan to edit this comment again soon. I do like mixing and matching all the different factions and seeing the synergies play out between them. Have seen games swing considerably from almost sweeping to then losing horribly just by one bad round of play or an event card played at just the right time. May pick up a couple of expansion packs to get the whole deck building thing going. A two player LCG really feels a niche in two player games for me as my group is really into LCGs right now. Always have it available if only 2 people show up to game night or whatever.

RATING: 7
I've never played Magic but this is a very enjoyable two player game. The rules are simple (with some card combination confusions here and there) and the gameplay is quick, not overstaying its welcome. The mechanics aren't very well wed to the theme overall but it satisying when the developers have made the behavior of a card here or there behave in a narratively appropriate manner. The factions do play differently and Lovecraft fans will like the game (though it well never approach the place Arkham Horror holds, even accounting for the disparity in game weight). As a final note, this "living card game" deserves serious praise for being a game product that can be enjoyed with just the purchase of the base game. No additional card purchases are required.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love the theme, like the gameplay and mechanics - and it's not (quite) a CCG, so that helps. You can buy the core set and play it 2 player and have fun.

Not having random distribution means you can't play traditional drafts - but you can just create a card pool and do a draft from that.

Only downside for me is limited availability and high price in the UK ... and lack of local players!

*** Update, after playing this more I prefer it to magic. 7 factions (+ neutral) over 5 colours (+ artifacts) gives a bit more variety and there are elements of the game that are much better:

1. resources - the fact each card can be a resource if you want means no more lost games because you can only draw lands or draw no lands

2. 3 stories - gives you 3 times the tactical choice, in magic it is just swing or not, and defend or not. With CoC it is commit to a story and also which one. 

3. Insanity/wounds - in magic you can have fiddly +1, -1 counters but that's it. In CoC you have insane (face down) and then wounds marked with counters.

4. 3 Domains - so rather than just play land, you have to chose where your resources go - do you want 3 domains with 3 value, or 1 with 6 and 2 smaller ones? Of course it depends on your deck ... but it is another element of choice.

I still enjoy magic and willingly play - but I prefer CoC

I like the "feel" and the combined factions. It´s hard to resist buying boosters for this thing. However I start to get the feeling that the game might actually be more fun without them if you are (like me) not into deck building.
Would probably get a worse rating without the "cool it´s Cthulhu" bonus.

I'm no fan of CCGs and LCGs, but I like this one. Quite strategic and difficult decisions every turn; beautiful components and good Lovecraft feel. For the better or the worse, there's much to keep track of, and the playing time is perhaps a little bit too long for what it is. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad LCG, but I prefer Netrunner for deck-building and Mythos for storytelling in the Lovecraft vein. Nothing wrong with the design at all: it's more a question of theme.

The Starter Set isn't all that great: it was the first one they did, and they included a single copy of every card instead of setting up playable decks. That's convenient for collectors, but doesn't make for a very good introduction to the game. Buy a second starter, or a cycle of expansions, and the decks become more interesting.

The design is nice. Any card can be played as a resource instead of its usual usage (as a creature or support card or what-have-you), which makes sideboards obsolete. I like the way you have to "attack" and "defend" stories, as well: a little like completing the stories in Mythos, although of necessity more generic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
THis game is just poorly premised from the start, with Cthulhu factions fighting against MObster factions over certain stories. IT's not at all Lovecraftian, but I suppose you have to do what you have to do to make a liscence work. But even if we ignore that, the gameplay is still hampered by a conflict system that discourages players from commiting if they aren't 99% certain of coming out ahead. I'm willing to play this occasionally for the theme but that's abotu it.

Very good. Both players need to be somewhat aggressive: spending too much time building up one's strength bogs down the game. This is true with most CCGs, I feel. It'll likely get better as we players get better (as happened with 7th Sea).

I love the gameplay and the theme. The domain/resource mechanic is very good, avoiding the need for specific resource cards (like lands in Magic). All factions can be combined freely (unlike, for example, in the Warhammer LCG.)

Sometimes it can be a bit tedious when a lot of characters are in play, counting all the symbols and skills to determine the possible outcomes of investigation. And in the base set there are only few event card that make the outcome non-predictable, but I assume that this is less of an issue once you add  expansions.

The multiplayer variants are fun too, although it takes much longer to play and doesn't play as smoothly as the 2-player game.

At first I was very enthusiastic about the LCG format, as it sounded so much better then the random-buy format of CCGs like Magic, but I miss the possibility to do drafts or other Limited formats.

This game becomes strangely chess-like by the midpoint of the draw piles. Although there is a threat of new cards, the number and relative importance of cards already in play provide a (slightly im-)perfect information challenge of considerable complexity. And then add the possibilities of bluffing in skilled play. All of which applies to play with the core set alone. The ultimate fun of the thing is in deckbuilding with Asylum Packs and boxed expansions.

I was not expecting the game that this turned out to be.  I was hoping for an Arkham Horror lite.  Instead, it turned out be... well, a boring CCG with Cthulhu art.  Ok, nice Cthulhu art, but that's really what's carrying the game for me right now.  After my first play, I was ready to reject this sucker - the stories are so lame!  I hated the whole concept of facing off rather than having a more open system of access to opponents cards.  But the damn art, as well as some words of encouragement on the 'geek, lured me back for seconds.  And the second time, it was better.  Lots better?  No.  Much better?  Eh.  It was better, I could potentially see enjoying the game as a card game with a pasted on Cthulhu element, a dueling game with some art I like, but it certainly won't scratch the itch I want it to.  

Traded for Thebes.

This is a review of the tapletop RPG, NOT THE CARD GAME!

To begin with,Call of Cthulhu is and has always been an incredible game.Based upon the works of H.P. Lovecraft and others of the horror and sci-fi genre's,
this game has great atmosphere.Taking on the roles of everyday people,called investigators, who eventually become entangled within the mysteries of the mythos.This can lead to some terrifying events for the investigators.Unlike games such as D&D or Pathfinder,Call of Cthulhu is not about direct combat,but surviving and avoiding combat if possible.Thats not to say that there wont ever be combat,but should be done so cautiously.The skills of the system uses percentile,aka d100,to resolve.This makes the flow very smooth when required to make checks,attacks,ect.The best part of Call of Cthulhu is the sanity system.During play,the investigators my stumble upon ancient and disturbing tomes,twisted and deadly creatures and other mythos(and sometimes non-mythos) related events that can shake the very fabric of the mind,which therefore causes sanity loss.This can result in some very interesting role playing situations.The default setting is the 1920's,but there are additional settings within the rulebook,1890's and present day.This allows different keepers(gamemasters) to play in any era they choose.The game is extremely fun and will entertain player's for years.I reccomend this game for it's ease of play and the pure theme of horror and the unknown that transpires.This game alone has earned more than 30 awards and has grown over the years.I understand that no rpg is perfect,and i am by no means stating such.But this game is incredible.The rulebook discusses the various sanity effects that can come about during play,disorders and other facets that can arise.Investigators can learn magic.(not the D&D or Pathfinder style),but a more darker form that taxes one's sanity to manipulate a power not meant to be known.I rated this game as 5 stars and is due mainly for the fact of the quality of fun and enjoyment in which it offers,and all with minimal hassel.Character creation takes a very minimal amout of time,which causes no delay in game time.If your a fan of horror or the unknown,and always wondered just how far one's sanity can be streched,this game is for you.But you dont need to take my word for it,but once you play this game,it'll speak for itself.

  Just picked this up after reading about it on the forums.  Never got to deep into magic due to my frightening need to own all of something once I start.  This is such a better model with the asylum packs vs blind boosters.  The game itself plays very well and is easy to learn.  I reccomend the video tutorails on the FFG website they explain things sequentially and simply.  Now I just need people to play against in NYC

This is a toss up for LCGs.  I like the theme and I'm interested based on the horror feel.  But, there are far more expansions out there than I can possibly purchase, and I feel like I would be at a disadvantage if I did try to play against another player who has been collecting longer than myself.

In the end, this will probably fall by the wayside for LCGs.

Best LCG by far.  The most interesting decisions in any game.  a Stunning card pool and incredible amount of options for deck building.  With combo decks and synergy decks.  Everything you could want from a card game.  Except no multiplayer which makes me sad.  i am sad this game got canceled.  Makes me wonder if the theme is what killed it for some people.

RATING: 7
Not sure what to make of it yet.  I think the Warhammer LCG by Fantasy Flight might be the better game, but I do really like the Lovecraftian theme.  I'm just trying to decide if the LCG thing is an avenue I want to go down.  While the collectible nature is solved, there is still the issue that CCGs tend to have mountains of rules errata, and take some level of dedication to enjoy.  There is also the deckbuilding issue.  So, while I do like the game, I'm not sure how much it's going to get played.  I think something like Thunderstone may be more where I'm at with gaming.

Surprisingly deep card game, once you get the hang of it. Very cool concept, the cards have good art, and the mythos is interesting.  Luck plays a good part, but resource management is key.  Very entertaining little LCG.

There are elements to the gameplay here, but it seems strange to me that the same player might represent two different factions with completely different goals.  Overall the dual faction thing really hurts the theme, and what does "gaining a story" really mean thematically?  If you want to play a great themed FFG card game then play Android: Netrunner.

We like Cthullu themed games for some reason.  This is good as are all the FFG LCG's.  Cool art and fairly deep, but intuitive mechanics.  Quite a bit if conflict obviously so it doesn't get as much play lately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
By far the best LCG that Fantasy Flight put out at the moment. 

Rather than be steadfastly loyal to the subject matter FFG have given the game a more pulp feel which fits well.

Mehcanically it can be a bit clunky if you don't know the system well, but once you do the game is fantastic. A game may take a while compared to other card games out there but the enjoyment pay off is far more than most give out.

Just wish the game was more popular and I had more opponents locally to play against.

RATING: 7
Call of Cthulhu LCG is a well designed Card Game. I like the starter as it includes 165 different cards. You can buy the starter 3 times and with the exception of the 3 x 10 story cards you can use every card in your decks. For tournaments you need the 12 story cards in "The Shifting Sands" expansion (they replace the story cards of the core set).
There are 8 factions and you can mix them as you wish. A great part of the fun is to combine multiple factions to get the best possible deck. 
We play CoC about 1-2 per month and have very much fun comparing our decks. 

UPDATE: Meanwhile I prefer games that don't cost every month additional money (as LCGs do). CoC is a fine game but I won't spend more money for this game. I sold my cards and instead bought Mage Wars.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure how the rules used to be; by the time I had my hands on it, they'd already changed the official meaning of the icons and text. What they changed them to is pretty cool, though a bit nonsensical at parts because they were originally intended to mean something else entirely. You'll have a few moments questioning "why is this here again?" and "but why do we have to split up this phase to seperate places in the round?" The answer is it's not because it's smart, it's because they had to justify their previous artwork. Even so, the game itself is pretty neat as long as you're willing to buy in pretty deep. Be prepared to buy several pricey sets if you want any sort of replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is FFG's most underplayed lcg. It is a good system and the Lovecraft theme is very well realized for a card game. There is a ton of cards out there so this one can be a bit daunting to jump into. If the following was more prevalent this would be one of my very favorites. I just wish more people played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The cthulhu deck can be overpowered.  A substantial Mi-go deck can hold it's own against the Cthulhu cards but no other deck can.  Syndicate & Police decks work well against each other but have no chance against Cthulhu or Mi-go decks.  Still a fun game if you are balanced against your opponent.  Otherwise you just get slaughtered.

This game is awful. The player isn't represented in any ways meaningful (what is the player? Character? Ancient One? What?). And unfortunately how to win the game is so dragging. There's no way to set up the game to be big bang later. You cannot play this fast, and with equal skill and deck, the game can stall very loooong time.

From the limited number of plays I have had I like the mechanics of the actual card play: interesting and relevant decisions to make and the card art is excellent in terms of the theme. 

If the meta-game of the deck building proves as good then this will be udging up to an 8.5. Update - the deckbuilding is great fun and the card pool is now huge.

Because of the intricacies (and cruciality) of committing to stories extending through your turn and into your oponents turn (i.e. characters committed to stories in your turn are still exhausted, and therefore unavailable to defend, in your opponents turn) the game does seem prone to more AP than normal. Beyond use of a timer, I'm not sure there is a way round this - have toyed with the idea of adding a dice mechanic to the icon struggles in the hope that by adding a little variability/randomness to the struggles it reduced the AP as it becomes impossible to work out the outcomes. However, this may change the game too radically.

There is a little bit of thematic dissonance in the game premise - you are competing for stories (what does that mean?) and you can field heroes and Mythos beasts in the same deck/side which feels wrong. Mono faction decks or themed/sensible alliances only for me.

A fun LCG dech building game

It is a LCG so its costs will go up as you need to buy more cards if you want to play with the serious players or in tournaments. SO each month a new addition that retails for $14.95. Do the math and make sure of your "serious" need to play with the big boys and girls.

I have lost interest because of lack of FtF opponents.

Just discovered this game and I am absolutely mind-blown. It might look a bit dated by today's standards, but I just dig its elegance, its theme and its mechanics. The factions are super different and it's great to look for balance between them in your deck. I'd love to play this every day, that's how much I like it. Too bad they just announced the game is dead. Oh well, I only play casual so I guess it's no big deal. THUMBS UP!

UPDATE: Despite really liking the theme and the gameplay, I had to let this one go. We just didn't play it much and we never really got into the deckbuilding aspect of it. Traded away in a Math Trade.

I like this game a lot: I enjoy the theme, the gameplay, the customizable decks. However, I haven't gotten into the game deeply enough to see if it's got staying power with me. CCGs and LCGs are a hard sell with my game group and I've never had the desire to play pickup games (a la MTG). The game feels a lot more streamlined than the LotR LCG which is a plus.

I do like the LCG concept that you can dip your toe in the pool if you like but you're not "required" to buy everything (I assume you would if you played competitively).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great resourcing and play mechanics.  Unfortunately it suffers a bit from poor individual card design and can get a little combo heavy like MTG.  So many games become a draw race to your combo cards instead of "playing a game".  Its not as bad as MTG in that regard and its much easier to break combos and locking up in Cthulhu.

Severely underrated LCG, probably due to the Cthulhu IP, which is not as popular as say Star Wars or LotR. Still, I like the pulp take on Lovecraft in the game, and the game itself has interesting twists on the standard CCG mechanics. I like that you commit to all three stories at once, which creates a lot of interesting choices as well as the resource mechanic. Also, the game plays faster then some of the other LCGs. Though it can feel quite 'mechanic-y' sometimes and the fact that you can play monsters and investigators in the same deck does seem kind of odd from a thematic perspective.

Though some (or most?) of the artwork in the core set is recycled from the CCG era, and isn't very pretty. The artwork in the new expansions is very nice though.

Going from CCG to LCG made the game seem better than it was.  In a word: Mathy.  It was an analysis-paralysis exercise in "Well, if I send this guy here I will win this phase by 2, but if I send him there then I can win two phases by 1 each."  And the further the cycles went, the lamer the gimmicks got (Day/Night cycles being especially artificial & dumb.)

As a huge fan of trading card games such as Magic and Kaijudo, I decided to give the living card game genre a try.  I chose this one because I love the whole Cthulhu mythos created by Lovecraft.  The art and flavor are good. The mechanics are not too difficult to pick up.  Not so sure on the story and struggles system - it feels cumbersome at times.

I rate the game 8 for game play.  Quite fun.  A number of reprinted cards are changed from the ccg, one character has even changed factions

A 5 for money value.  At the price of this core set I'd would have expected a complete play set not just one set of 150 odd cards.  Or at least multiples of some common cards.  Even the chapter packs give multiples.  As it is, 1 or 2 more core sets have to be purchased to get into effective deckbuilding.  Base set cost $50+ CDN, more than the cost of the 500 card Dominion game.

A 1 for components.  The white borders are a bad decision by the graphic designer for a dark themed game.  The card stock seems poor although playable when sleeved.  The counters, map, and statues seem overproduced or not really needed.  Most artwork images are reprinted from the ccg but refocused and 'lightened' to generally poor effect.  Plus the card back isn't compatable with cards from older sets.  Apparently (unlike the Game of Thrones LCG) the CoC game had to get new backs so as to remove the word 'collectable'.  A shaft to the old ccg players who now have to buy card sleeves.

Played Netrunner, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs but i found my Card Game here. Great Game with huge variety but expect to buy more than one Core Set. :) 

Edit: rated it down from 10 to 9. For my taste there is to much Erata here. The publisher should produce the corrected cards with an expansion. The huge FAQ is a letdown for new players. At last this is an common issue with most long lived expandable card games...

For someone that does not care for CCG titles, this LCG (living card game) is sufficient for a quick fix.  The theme is great; it's Call of Cthulhu!  The game mechanics are not as in-depth as other CCG, so the hard-core CCG may not care too much for this one.  But for the person who wants a CCG quick fix and not wanting to spend lots of money, this fixed set will suffice.

Unclear symbology and over-complicated rules keep this one from the top of the LCG-line. I love the setting and the production values are top-notch, but It's just too slow and "thinky" for it to work as the fast-paced CCG-style game it's setting out to be.

RATING: 3
The basic mechanics of this game are very simple and work well. But then virtually every card you play adds a factor or variation to the basic rules such that players spend a lot of time adding and matching factors to determine the possible success of any action and then proceed if assured of victory or not if the sums do not add up. With few "instant" effects in the base set, the game bogs down in its own arithmetic - tedious.

RATING: 8.5
The game's not bad, but you definitely need an extra core set to make it worthwhile.  As it stands, with one single core set, it's just a 7.5 rating tops.  Rating jumps to an 8-8.5 when you have an expansion or two, and at least 1 more core set.  Then the game is pretty good and can lead to some pretty intense games with tough decisions having to be made throughout.

Edit: Traded away.  The game is great, but there are a lack of players in my community, and I felt that the expansions from The Key and The Gate and onward broke the game, restricting the ability to make a large variety of sets that could stand up to the best of tournament players to only a few sets with ridiculous combos.

I had this game in its pure CCG days, played it a time or two, never warmed to it, and moved it on, but with Jack's interest in LCGs and the mythos I deemed it worth another shot, and I'm glad of it. I don't know if it is improved balance with the starter box, revised expectations, or Jack's enthusiasm, but the game finally clicked for me. It is a bit mathy as you anticipate what will become of each story conflict before you commit your assets, but it occurs to me that this matches the theme, that mythos investigation is a lot of preparation and research (followed by unpleasant surprises). As I've finally seen the theme emerge from this game I am much more eager to play, and it makes a good change-of-pace from our Warhammer Invasion games, which is a more slam-bang experience.

RATING: 6.75
The out of the box decks are too luck dependent. Drawing two cards per round is not enough unless there are options to do so, but there aren't. Maybe a house rule would do good. Still i like it for the theme but surely not for the urge to buy expansions to have reasonable decks.

I think this game is awesome and deeper than Warhammer Invasion (another game I love). However, the play group for this game is smaller in Calgary, which I think is a function of game play being less aggressive/straightforward and the theme. Everyone likes fantasy-theme, not everyone is familiar with 1920's theme, so there is less buy in around here. I don't play it as much as Invasion, but not because I don't like it.

Objective of the game to win 3 stories from the middle of the board. Plays like MTG. Instead of mana use resources which are kind of like pokemon.

It's a great game for fans of Lovecraft - oozing with theme (some people may find the pulp atmosphere somewhat discouraging) and interesting in terms of mechanic. Although the basic box includes only one copy of each card, it still gives you ready-to-play decks which would otherwise (in the CCG version) be really time and money consuming to build. In my opinion it is not only a great game but also a fantastic way of resurrecting an otherwise dead and dearly missed product.

I've been playing this game for over a year now and it's still my favourite constructed card game to play.  It's got everything going for it - crazy H.P. Lovecraft monsters and 1920s noir theme; fantastic art work; brilliant mechanics that are not difficult to learn, yet provide deliciously challenging gameplay; a deep card pool that is almost infinitely customisable; and Fantasy Flight Games' fantastic Living Card Game fixed pack distribution model that keeps it fresh and affordable.  Love this game!

Hmm, first impressions indicate a good, solid CCG. Reminiscent of MtG in many places, but with unique features as well. In true CCG fashion, it's probably too involved for me these days: It will take repeated playing to get to know the cards and get the game up to speed and I am not sure I want to go down that road... Still, moderately enjoyable, even played casually.

Neat 1v1 LCG based on the Cthulhu mythos where players are trying to outdo each other in a couple of different categories to score an adventure.

The statues that come with the game are really nice especially if painted. The resource tracking that's done with them is pretty neat as well except that the way that cards are stacked underneath can make the game a bit cumbersome when exhausting those resources considering the amounts you need for some cards.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2013)

At last I got to play CoC. Before playing it I thought I would like the game and I do. Android: Netrunner is still my preferred LCG, but CoC is fun to play. The rules are not too complex but the game do offers some interesting decisions, I particularly like the setup and each turn resource phase, because knowing what to and where to play the resource isn’t always obvious. Love the theme and the art is good. The plastic statues are gorgeous, but nonfunctional as I tend to pack my cards in deck boxes for easy storage and traveling.

This is very reminiscent of Star Wars LCG, you can tell both games are from the same designer, still I prefer the mechanics of this one over Star Wars. I feel this is a bit more complex than SW in mechanics and deck building. 

The deck building aspect of this game is overwhelming (for me), there are too many cards to explore (with the asylum packs) so I think I will play a lot of CoC. It has a very high replayability. I have been having trouble to find opponents to play with, still the completionist in me cry for me to buy everything there is for the game. 

I dislike that on the core game, only one card of each was provided, so if you want to build a competitive deck you need to buy 3 copies of it. For me, this is unacceptable as you cannot play to your heart content with the core edition alone. At least in Android: Netrunner you have many repeats. 

Bottom line, this is a game I hope and want to play more in the near future. I just realized I’m becoming an LCG junkie. So far my preferred LCGs (I have only tried 3) in order of preference are Android: Netrunner, Call of Cthulhu LCG and Star Wars LCG. I have high hopes for LOTR and Warhammer: Invasion. 

One of 2008´s favorites.

RATING: 5
I thought this game was quite a bit of work with not much reward. The attacker plays cards on their side of 1 of 3 story cards and then the defender does the same, but only against stories the attacker is going after. There are potentially 4 separate majority comparisons that each affect the outcome of an individual battle, along with special abilities. The attacker needs to consider all possible defender combos before placing and then the defender needs to consider all possibilities in the hopes that the attacker overlooked something. If there's a lot of cards on the table, it seems like the player who forgets about some ability (or is unlucky being able to get cards to the table fast) is going to come out on the losing end. The objective is to be the first to get 5 clue tokens on your side of a story card to claim it. The first player to claim 3 cards wins. The study of abilities and potential icon match-ups on every turn is rather tedious and the outcome of all that work is uninspired. The best parts of the game are ripped off from Magic.

A really enjoyable CCG. Lacks the mechanical sheen of Magic, suffering from a few rough edges and badly-worded card effects, but it uses a strong theme well, with a lot of the conflicts being sad little stories of sacrifice, to a bullet or to madness.

This Card game is awesome! The theme and atmosphere are great, and storytelling is incredible. Play it at night, always ;)

It is slow ans solitary, but you can play with 4 players with some variants, that gives the game more challenge (but also extending the match time).

Not bad. The LCG element is a great twist to the money-sucking of CCG/TCG but still, the deck building element means you need to have your own set or spend time trying to read through cards on the fly at game night. The game itself is good. Not my favorite of the build-your-own-deck card games but much much better than most.

RATING: 9.5
I'd have given this game a 10 if not for some odd templating choices.  Example:  "Lower the cost to play Thing from the Stars by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for each resource type other than (Hastur symbol) attached to the domain drained to pay for Thing from the Stars."  It does make sense, it's just not as clear as could be.

The game has great flavor.  I love Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, even if the man himself was quite the racist.  The cards suggest really interesting stories.  Playing the game always makes me want to go read some Cthulhu stories.  

Having only played a few games, I haven't really figured out good tactics, but I can say that there are a lot of ways to win.  (Although it does seem like rushing strategies are the best, at least within the base game.)  The game is very strategically complex, possibly even more complex than Magi:  The Gathering.  Players use Character cards to compete for Story cards.  There are three random Story cards placed between the two players, with a small deck of additional Story cards to the side.  Players take turns adding Resources to their Domains (a bit like playing a land in Magic), using their resources to play Character card, and buffing their Characters or harming opposing Characters with Support cards and Event cards (which act a lot like Enchantments and Instants in Magic).  

Characters can then be attached to a particular story card and battle within that story.  First there is a Terror battle.  The player who loses must choose a character attached to that story to go insane.  (Again, relating it to Magic, I think of insanity like "Tap target creature.  It doesn't untap during it's controller's next untap step."  It's a bit more complicated than that, but in many instances it will work that way.)  Then Combat happens.  The losing player must choose a Character in that story to take a wound.  Most Characters can only take one wound, so it will probably die.

Arcane resolves next, which allows the winning player to "ready," or untap, a Character.  That Character can then be used during the opponent's turn.

An Investigation phase follows.  The winning player gets to add an Investigation token to the Story card.  

Finally, the Skill points of the remaining Characters on each side are totaled up and compared.  If the active player has more Skill points on his or her side, he or she may add an additional Investigation token to the Story card.

The first player to get five Investigation tokens on his or her side of the Story card wins that story.  The first player to acquire three Story cards wins the game.

It has a lot of depth to it, and the expansions increase one's deck-building options and allow for greater customization and strategy.  Also, it's a lot of fun.  Can't forget that.

I've heard that there are ways to do a CoC LCG draft or Sealed Deck, but I haven't seen how that works.  That was my favorite way to play Magic: The Gathering back in the day, so I am very curious to try it with the Call of Cthulhu Living Card Game.

I'm sure it was better as a CCG then as a "stand alone game".  The various factions aren't particularly balanced, the gameplay is somewhat bland and overall there's better ways to send time.  We take it out when time is short and we feel like delving into Lovecraft's universe, but not a big success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think this might be one of the most under-rating games in LCG history. Maybe due to the theme, it just hasn't been as wildly popular as Doomtown or Netrunner, but I think it's the better game. And the theme actually works brilliantly. If you're a fan of the Mythos, this game is a must-have. Very easy to learn and play, but the strategy is top-notch both in deck-construction and in piloting the deck you build. I've played other LCG's, like Doomtown, Netrunner, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, and Call of Cthulhu is definitely my favorite among them... although Doomtown comes in a close second. It's like a thinking-man's Magic the Gathering. I just love it. 

I don't give a ton of games a 9 out of 10, but this one deserves it.

The Call of Cthulhu LCG is functionally clever. The symbol four stages each turn are well thought out, but their actual application in the character cards is a little less so. The theme comes across in waves: not constantly, and fleeting. Probably the largest problem with the game is that there is no ready catch-up mechanism. If you're losing, you'll probably stay losing.

6/2012 I sooo much wanted this to be a good game; unfortunately I've been let down.  The theme lends itself to a free-flowing eerie athmospheric experience. Game components are good with colorful player cards with flavor text true to the theme.  But the story cards are missing flavor text, so where's the 'story'? And the game's abstract mechanics is way too limited and doesn't fit the theme at all. It's a big dissapointment.  Sorry.

Should have played about 6 times till now. The game does have something to praise: now we have a game that objective is not reducing opponent's life to zero! The 7 factions (+ neutral) all have vastly different powers.
Both of us are playing using a single starter box. The problem is quite evident: some cards are way too powerful, so if you're able to draw it, most likely you could win the game. OK, the game is LCG and is designed for constructed play, but how many would just buy packs after packs and keep on constructing only to find a small community playing this game? If you want to play something out of the box, netrunner is evidently the better option. But how would FFG, the ameritrash money squeezing monster, would do to my beloved game? Let's see!

I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft and most of FFG's incarnations of his works, but I've had a hard time getting into the CoC LCG. For thing, there's a bit of thematic struggle in having players control good and evil simultaneously in my opinion. I've also come to find that games run a lot longer than 30 minutes. Granted, I only have the core set. I may look into expanding this one and giving it more of a chance one day, but I definitely prefer the LOTR LCG to this one and I'm more interested in investing in that one.

Welcome to the world of the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, a world based on the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and his literary circle. In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.
A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.

RATING: 5.8
Rating goes down with each play. The game seems to end right when it feels like you're getting started. You barely get through a 1/4 of your deck. I feel like there is a fabulous CCG inside the cards, but the rules strangle it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I loved the collectible version of the CoC card game, and the new LCG format is a perfect reentry point for those who already know the game. For new players, it's merely very good, since it demonstrates only one of the two strengths of this game, making the initial hurdle higher than it needed to be.

What the Core Set demonstrates is that due to the wonderful resource system, deck construction is trivially easy, at least for casual play. It's easy in the core set, where you just pick any two factions, and it's easy if you have a couple of cards flying around: grab 50 cards from one or two factions that appeal to you thematically, make sure that most of them are characters, and voila! You have a working deck, at least for casual play. And casual is where the cool people are, of course.

The other strength of CoC is that the struggle and story mechanics are interesting in and by themselves, so that the game is fun and challenging even without cards that provide special abilities or rule exceptions. This is a great feature, but the decision to showcase the variety of cards from the game's history in the Core Set does obfuscate it a bit. Possibly two fixed decks with no-frills characters and some duplicate cards would have provided a better starting point for newcomers - the old Premium starters were pretty good for that purpose and might be worth fetching up if you want to size the game up before jumping in.

Prize from BGG.CON 2009, later traded.

I want to like this game better than I do, for many reasons, one of them being the awesome tentacly thing on the cover.

But I am critical of several aspects of the game. The Agency seems overpowered, and I don't know how to beat it. It's a bit procedural, or math-bound, with the narrative often being submerged by number crunching as you analyze what will happen if you contest a story. It doesn't have a strong sense of Lovecraftian goodness or thematic immersion. In three games, no one has ever chosen to implement the effects of a story card, thus I wonder why they're there. In my experience, you only get about a third to a half of the way through your deck, so there is a luck of the draw element (not a deal killer in and of itself--I enjoy luck) and dissatisfaction about how few of your cards you actually see.

I'm willing to keep playing the game, however, because it has potential and I love the theme (such as it is). Still, I wish I didn't feel like I was just doing a random math problem so  much of the time.

Not yet played, but will comment on the fact that you need to have 3x copies of the core game in order to be able to deck-build as you want. This is so hypocritical considering that the idea of LCGs is that you shouldn't need to spend a lot of money buying random things to get what you want, and then they skimp out on the core box forcing you to buy 3 copies of it.

UPDATE: After another play, the CoC LCG is simply too bland, staid, and unevocative for the subject matter. There are better games on the Cthulhu Mythos out there, and far better CCG/LCGs.

Finally played vanilla CoC LCG. It's not bad, it's simply too abstracted.  Characters who go insane merely tap and straighten next turn.  Lots of characters have interesting, thematic abilities and icons...but just as many don't, diluting the theming. I'm not sold on the economic engine...it's OK, but I actually prefer tapping actual locations and land to get purchase power, and for most of the game I had very few cards in hand, limiting my decisions.  But the worst are the Story Card abilities.  You fight tooth, nail, and claw over Story cards, and we never used any of their abilities.  So, for me, there's a lot of thematic failure and missed opportunities.

Might play with some of the expansions and see if they broaden the experience some.

Wonderful evolution of the Magic CCG tradition with two important innovations.  Each card has duel use either as the traditional character/event or as a permanent source of mana for other cards of that same type.  This eliminates mana screwage/flooding and creates such rich decisions on how to use each card.  Second, each character has ratings for up to five different categories that are used in combat even before you take into account key traits with special powers.  This creates a wonderful puzzle when determining which characters to attack with and which to keep available to defend.  Deck building is completely unnecessary, which I find an added bonus.  Loses one point because the game can get into grid lock if each players characters have offsetting strengths, leaving each player hoping to draw an event or mega character to break the stalemate.  Also deserves a place of honor in my collection for getting me into LCGs.

Shares artwork with Arkham Horror, so you know it looks good.  Gameplay is very deep and every one of your actions (or inactions) can have far reaching consequences.  Does not play well with multiplayer rules, but it a highly thematic and fun horror game for two.  If you plan on building custom decks, be sure to buy two copies of the core set!

I like the game play in this game, but the people that play games with me don't like the deck construction aspect of the the LCGs. They like playing the game, but don't like spending time outside of the game building decks. I crafted a way to build semi-random decks for everyone, but there are too many specific card interactions to make that work very well. Not getting much play now.

One of the simpler LCGs in terms of mechanics, perhaps because it came earlier in the piece. Build up your resources, deploy units, attachments and supports, then decide which objectives to attack with which units, and which units to hold back for defense. The opponent chooses what units to defend with, and then it's on, competing in each of 4 icon levels to double-tap, wound, untap, and get a success in the objective investigation. Then get another success if you have a higher skill level, and another if the objective's undefended. 5 successes and you win that objective, first to 3 objectives wins. Having played Star Wars first, I can now see its pedigree here. The game is easier to learn and play than the other LCGs, though there's the usual raft of keywords and effects you'll need to familiarise yourself before you gain fluency. Coming to the game late is both a blessing and a curse ... a huge range of deck types to explore, but requiring a huge investment. Although the game is fun, my time investment in the others might preclude this from joining the party.

I really like this game.  It lives up to the LCG billing of being able to play right out of the box.  But it becomes even more fun with more card options offered by the expansion sets and asylum boxes. 

I've read a bit of Lovecraft and the game portrays the theme very well.  Can't wait to play it some more and acquire more cards.

I knew I'd like this game since it's a solid CCG with the most awesome theme ever.
I never was much into CCGs but like so many else, because of the LCG format I'm able to join the card player community. 
This is definitely one of the best ideas from FFG.

I own the core set and am totally pleased with it. A lot of different cards and combinations to explore and yet more to come.
Games tend to go rather quickly, so that's not the problem. The main issue is that it takes a while to see the useful moves. You'll probably do some rather stupid moves in your first games, I know I did.

Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!


Edit: Currently I own the first cycle of the six card packs.

First 2 learning games. Very interesting game. A lot of text on the cards so a little slow in the beginning when everything is new. But very promising game indeed! Want to play more. Perhaps would be easier also if we only played with one faction and not two, but need another base game for that.

3 more games and now with 2 base games, i.e. only one faction + some neutral cards. GREAT GAME! After an embarassingly quick first game we had two very tight games. 
All 3 games with same 2 factions so have not seen close to all that's available in the pack yet. 

Possible 10 rating.

I love the other Fantasy Flight LCGs - Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Netrunner - but this one was my least favourite. There was no tension between players - not like in the other LCGs - especially at the beginning when we were still building up our resources. We didn't really try building our decks, but that definitely would have made it more balanced. It was cool how the cards became resources - but not as innovative a use of cards as Star Wars. Picked this game up second hand and ended up trading it in a math trade. Cool idea, but not nearly at the same calibre as the other LCGs (haven't played Warhammer LCG).

A friend and I really really wanted to like this game.  We are both fans of Lovecraft, and Lovecraft-inspired games.  This just didn't work for us.  The concept of trying to win "stories" and the mechanics associated with resources, attack and defense just weren't what we wanted in a Lovecraft card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
An "ok" game out of the box. A little hard to get into despite the neat instructions if you have no previous experience in Magick type games. Some factions really work well together and others should never meet. 
Dominance tends to constantly flip from one player to the other - which give a sense that the decks are usually balanced against each other. Compared to A game of Thrones LCG, players may play events during almost any phase - this leads to a lot of interruptions and screwed up plans at potentially any moment. Although it adds some excitement, I prefer a little more structured play. As with most deck building games, it takes money and commitment to build a decent deck and compete.

As all Cthulhu themed game I loved the madness aspects. You play heroes or minions with which you assign to quests while the other player tries to stop you. Then come the icon tests which kill characters or make them mad. Mad units come back in the game the next round tapped. The first player may get the upper hand especially when playing with beginners. And I'm not sure that all faction combinations work very well. The game might work better with a few card expansions. I still had fun with it.

Call of Cthulhu LCG is the game that brought me back to the card tables.

Just recently got into this after playing Warhammer: Invasion. This is a great card game, and I think its better than Warhammer. There is more strategy and depth to this game, and its quite a deep thinking type of experience. Many different groups to choose from, including good humans and evil cultists, and two major monster groups as well. Superb evocative art and atmosphere make this game sing.

I'm glad to see this game continue on in some format, but I feel like the design went off the rails a bit.  The cards have too much text on them, and are generally too complicated.  I get sick of constantly asking my opponent if I can read the cards they played, which really sucks the enjoyment out of the game.

The CCG never really had this problem so I don't know if it is the designer who is at fault, the longevity of the game, or something else.  But this game has never quite managed to capture the excitement of the CCG the way I hoped it would.

RATING: 8
Call of Cthulhu has a ton of excellent things going for it, and a few not-so-exciting ones. The game, at least with a reasonable amount of expansions, is very good. The depth of the card pool adds a lot to the gameplay, and recent expansions have only made it better. The distribution model is slightly different from other LCGs, and it benefits the game significantly because of it. Instead of 6 small packs followed by one "deluxe", the game is released only in deluxe expansions. This allows there to be less chaff in the product you buy as filler, and lets FFG focus on power level issues for all cards rather than just specific ones, meaning you'll generally get more playable product per pack than otherwise.

The biggest downside to the game is that it's not very majorly supported at this point, I assume due to the success of the other LCG titles (notably Netrunner, which shares a lead developer). Rules and tournament issues tend to go for a long time without being fixed. I also dislike the fact that errata exists to adjust power levels of cards, instead of just relying on the banned/restricted list to keep the game under control.

Overall, the game feels very similar to Legacy in MTG, without the massive price tag.

Played this once and was very overwhelmed by all the icon struggles but on the other hand underwhelmed by strategic choices.

The base box is good for some mindless fun. You choose two factions, don't worry about deck building, and mythoing you go.

However the game really shines when expansions and deck building enter the scene. The synergy between card is a thing of beauty, and building and refining your deck a satisfying experience. If you are not interested in this, however, be prepared to get creamed by even an average player - and if you do not love frustrating experiences then you will shelve the box FAST. 

Or maybe you will like the game even more, since it is very thematic - and what's more Lovecraftian than ending up splattered every time?

RATING: 10
"Call of Cthulhu" LCG is not an easy game. It's demanding, it's taxing, sometimes it's even a royal pain in the ass... but in a very good way. Contrary to some other collectible card games, the deck creation aspect is only half of the success. There are interesting decisions aplenty - the fact that you battle for three stories simultaneously forces you to think strategically. There's a delicate balance required to win; you can't play too offensively or defensively.

Flaws? The core set alone doesn't give almost any deckbuilding opportunity. You can only mix two different factions (seven in total in the box), and some don't mix well anyway. That doesn't mean the core set grows old quickly. You can have hours and hours of fun - somehow evey game, even with the same deck, feels very  different.

Other than that, it's superb in my eyes. Love the theme, the graphics, the style of play. No other collectible card game can give me so much of a headache. I almost feel exhausted after a long, competitive session. And instantly want MORE!

We played our first game of Call of Cthulhu using the Centacle 4-player rules, which may have been a mistake. I have a feeling this game will get much better once players are familiar with the cards, but in such a large game there was just too much information being tossed around.

What I can say after my limited experience-
There's a crazy amount of customization available between all the different factions and I'm excited to build decks suited more to my play style. I find the victory condition (collecting story cards) to be very innovative and fun. 

I'm looking forward to delving deeper into Call of Cthulhu's game mechanics.

09-08-2015. Rated after 1 play. Call of Cthulhu LCG is one of the many LCGs I have played now (Netrunner, Invasion, Qonquest, Star Wars). I liked Call of Cthulhu basegame quite a bit.

In the game, you play a two-player game using preconstructed decks. The cards in the decks consists of characters, equipment and events. You pay for these cards by 'exhausting' locations, that you can add cards to to give more stuff to summon with. With your characters, you aim to win story cards.

Each turn, you unexhaust all your stuff, You draw two cards (typically). You can play one card from your hand to one location. The location subsequently then gives one extra 'energy' of the type that card provides. You then summon all kinds of cards as long as you can pay (max = exhaustable locations).
Then, you can attack with all your stuff one 1 -3 of the 3 story missions. You do this by assigning characters to each story you want to attack.
During such an attack, your opponent kan assign characters to defend.

Combat works by checking strength for each icon on the left bar of the card. If you have the most of the 'tentac;e
' icon in case, your opponent must make one of his characters mad. If you have more gun icons, your opponent must assign one damage to a character (most have 1 hp). If you win the book icon, you may uexhaust a character. If you win lore, you score 1 story point. All cards have one additional value, strength. If youu have most.. you get a story point.. if you go through unopposed (ie. everyone of your opponents is dead of insane) you score one additional point (if I am correct in this..)

One interesting aspect of CoC is that all cards have more than one use. Do you want to use the card as energy, or as something you want to play? Interesting choices there. It did feel a little old-fashioned, in having to calculate many stats and having to keep track of many abilities, enhancements and all icons. Otherwise, fine game.. but could use a polished 2.0 version.

Very limited first impressions of this game are great. It is easier to teach than AGoT LCG and I think the depth of play is still quite high. 2 player only is a plus and a minus, but not a big deal either way. The biggest plus for me is that even a single core set gives a good amount of variety when you mix and match factions.

I like the LCG concept - given my completionist nature the fact that I really can own every card is quite appealing, and the game's pretty fun too, with about a 20 minuite, quite tactical game.

The Asylum packs are good, but do lack somthing due to the fact that the 20 cards are distributed between the 7 (+1) factions, leading to only one or two cards per faction per box, but they do ensure no faction becomes 'too good'.

Deckbuilding looks good, but just throwing together two factions at random leads to great games too.

I'm a closet fan of the Lovecraft mythos and lapsed Magic player so CoC LCG appeals to me at every level.

First, the Core Set is a nice, inexpensive way to get into the game and the bits are great.  Art on the cards is a little hit or miss but generally are good.  We've grabbed quite a few Asylum Packs and the combined story and mechanics are also very good.  The purchase options are just about right.  The news that future APs are going to have full 3x distributions is good news.

Each game is fairly quick.  Deck construction should take the bulk of the time.  For our purposes we wish there were more pre-constructed options.  We are eagerly awaiting the Secrets of Arkham boxed expansion.

CoC LCG is really a 2-player game.  Multiplayer seems a bit tacked on.

ADD:
Now with a second Core Set, almost all the Asylum Packs and Secrets of Arkham, the games are getting a bit longer in that there are so many more interesting decisions to make with more interesting decks.  This game is creeping up to a 9/10 with expansions.

I finally got the chance to play this game and I have to say that I was pleased with all of the different elements.  Unlike some card games, the decisions are not necessarily automatic.  There are instances where you want to hang back to be able to defend stories for when your opponent goes after them.  Games can be quick or they can get drawn out.  I like that the games can take on different pacing.  It's a winner for me and a solid 8, with a chance to go up with added plays.

Fun two player card game. Watching your characters lose their marbles or just plain get clobbered left right and centre is as amusing as disheartening - the game immerses you in the feel of Lovecraft's mythos nicely.

Update: We actually haven't played this for a while now, and honestly I don't see myself playing it again any-time soon. It hasn't held my interest. For lovers of the Lcg format willing to spend the cash, this one can probably still be recommended however.

Second update: After trying this again, I think I have finally pinpointed what I don't enjoy about the game. With only the first two boxed sets, there seems to be little synergy between the factions - doubtless buying more cycle packs would fix this, but it would be a waste of money at this point. 

There is also far too much squinting at icons and mentally tallying up the struggles at each story before  committing to anything and actually playing the game.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Solid game, I can see the "AGOT 2.0" similarities, but it plays quite differently from AGOT. I like the resource system, and though it takes a little to get used to, the simplified timing rules during challenge resolution work well.

Call of Cthulhu LCG, after 1 play, rating: 7
I like Lovecraft and this game was a little fun, but I didn’t get involved as I can get in Arkham Horror or Battlestar Galactica. Will not buy it but if anyone owns it and want to play and we don’t have a better two player game at hand? Well then I’m game  (But you are sure you don’t have Space Hulk, Monsterpocalypse or Blood Bowl: Living RuleBook at home?)

Good game. Very good, actually. Doesn't see the table very much, though. I think it was a mistake marketing this as a two player game on the box, since it can be played with more players. One of the first CCGs re-released as an "LCG" type game.

Me gusta mucho, el formato LCG es un poco menos engañabobos que el formato CCG, pero aún así los juegos de cartas 1vs1 no me convencen, prefiero aquellos en los cuales puedo jugar solo si se tercia. No obstante, este lo tengo por nostalgia y porque sale Cthulhu ;)

I really wanted to love this game.  It captures the Cthulhu mythos really well, it's MASSIVE (lots of cards available), and the LCG format suits me better than CCG.  I always have a lot of fun playing the game, but I think I'm just not that good at the deck-building meta ... because I always lose.  That's when I can even find anyone to play - here in London there don't seem to be many people around who also have this, so usually I have to bring a few pre-made decks to a gathering of friends and see who's up for it.  Despite the investment I made in getting myself set up with a good card pool this one just isn't seeing much play.

The emphasis on deck building over spending the most money is what makes the LCG format work so well in my opinion.  Call of Cthulhu is my personal favorite of the LCG games.  The factions are diverse and there are no limits on how many or what factions you can mix.  This leads to a lot of great deck diversity and many viable strategies.

The best part of this game over a game like Magic: The Gathering other than the removal of random cards (when you buy the core set you get 1 of every card, expansions are 3 of every card) is that there are no resource cards.  Instead all of your cards double as resources and this leads to the removal of luck based on resource draw and adds a strategic element in choosing what to resource.

Overall an amazing game.

RATING: 4
update: played a few games now. Also including a couple of expansion sets. Games can feel a bit one-sided, very random, as one player manages to amass characters and dominate the game. Problem is that the system does not allow the game to end quickly enough, so a cake-walk for one player can be dragged out to a 45+ minute game. If it's one-sided I want it to end quickly. 

Getting less keen on this. Seeing some of the problems from the CCG rearing their head. The collectable/living element of this game means it is just not balanced enough out of the box. Rebranding the game was a perfect opportunity for FFG to address this by setting the card distribution in the starter set. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case. Biggest problem is that all cards are unique so luck of he draw plays a *massive* factor. Perhaps the best solution is to get together with friends who own sets who are willing to trade, and specialise in one or two factions? The cynical side of me says this was a ploy by FFG to get individuals to buy multiple sets. At the end of the day it will appeal to the same sort of people as the CCG, despite the re-branding as an LCG. Basically, crack-whores for Cthulhu (like me!) will buy the game to get the pretty cards and figures. I suspect there's a good set of game mechanics underneath the gloss, but it'll take time and investment to get to. Just like a CCG then.

NOTE: Bought this again in November 2013. Maybe didn't get in to this before because my regular gaming partner is not so in to the deck construction side of things. Hoping to play with a few people who are open to this kind of game soon.

For some reason this game really works for me, I really like playing it a lot, even though I don't have any friends who play it. I mostly entertain myself by building decks for casual play and flipping coins with my friends to see who gets which.

RATING: 6
The battling for stories can sometimes drag on for a loooong time because you'd want to plan for every eventuality. It's what I enjoy about these kinds of card games. The tactical depth is just so appealing.

This is not a light card game, like Dominion, this has actual, difficult choices that will burn you if you make the wrong one, and will burn you for rounds to come.

Sometimes you are screwed sometimes everything goes just right and sometimes you need to get your head out of your ass and redesign that monstrosity of dysfunctional deck you thought would kick ass.

A thinking man/womans game. The amount of entertainment from the core set and the arkham expansion as well as a bit of proxying has long paid off.
The money you put into this game and the hours of thinking, planning and playing pays off better than almost any other game I've invested in.

Just build a deck of two factions and see how much you can tweak it. Try swapping one faction and keeping the other and experience how much the game chances for you.

It really is something.

Despite the sometimes ambigous rules around certain cards and the mechanical approach I really, really like this game. It follows that magic formula of beeing easy to learn, teach, play and hard to master.

It's basic r/p/s mechanism seems dull at first sight but through the subtle actions or responses the cards can trigger, a layer of significant depth emerge. One of which needs considerable thought to plan out and even so, the event cards can still throw a stick into your scheme's gears and by that there is an exiting game flow of ebb and flood.

This is a brilliant looking game, fantastic theme, and the whole LCG instead of CCG concept makes me happy (I won't ever play another CCG again). Fantasy Flight is doing almost everything right (LCG, playable core set, themed asylum packs). All that is missing is a good way to find other players (their league support is good, but not well organized).

A very interesting take on the cthulhu theme. A good combination of strategy and theme  If i am able to bring it to the table more, might be able to uncover more strategies and theme.

The base game does seems to steer towards lack of spells and surprises.Also terror creatures are terribly hard to get rid of with the base game card spread.

A great LCG that has a whole lot of variability and options for customization - thanks to the metric-crap-load of expansions published for it. :-) Defending seems superior to attacking, especially between less "Event-full" decks, so drawn out stalemates can become a problem.

RATING: 8
Rich with theme, Call of Cthulhu:The Card Game obviously has benefited from being a reboot of an existing CCG. It is quick, balanced and smoooooth, as might be expected from a game that's seen a ton of playtesting in its previous CCG incarnation. This is Fantasy Flight at its best ... a professional presentation from art and components to rules and mechanics. Recommended for anyone who likes games that offer some player options and depth but still play in a half hour or less.

Call of Cthulhu is a great game, but it sometimes lacks balance, depending on the luck of one of the players. Maybe that happens because I only have the core set, but I don't know, maybe there should be some mechanic to make it more balanced. Although there is this minor problem (which doesn't show up every time), this game is also very fun, and if you like the Cthulhu Mythos, it is certainly worth a try. After Blood Bowl, this is the card game that I play the most, since it normally plays very quickly and is simple to setup (the numbers of plays on the side haven't been updated for a long time).

Traded: Too similar to Magic.

Similar in complexity to Magic the Gathering, but without the irritation of keeping useless land in your deck. 

The base game doesn't have a wide enough variety of cards to be replayable. You probably need two or three asylum packs to make it a full game. 

It comes with a board and chunky Cthulhu pieces, which is a nice touch. 

The factions (similar to colours in Magic) are thematically distinct. 

Will probably increase in rating with further plays.

Welcome to the world of the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, a world based on the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and his literary circle. In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.
\13\\13\
The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world.
\13\\13\
A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.

I dunno. After a few games, it's decent, nothing seems horribly awry, but without more hidden info in the story phase, it's all too calculable.  I did like the resource decisions (Magic would be [i]tremendously[/i] improved by something similar, removing Land), and I liked the stories in theory (in practice we only activated 1 of the 7 or 8 taken across the 2 games).

But the calculability...as the active player, I know what will happen.  Since the defender has no incentive not to commit, as he'll refresh immediately, it's just chugging through the effects to identify "surprises".

I think this one's done for me.  Just too many better CCGish games out there that I haven't played enough of.

EDIT: Raising rating from 6. Have bought a ton of cards, and really like the game. It's a bit cumbersome, but I am still getting close to having all the APs, but have a lot of deluxes to go. 

Rating based on a plays of the core set +1 of all of the currently existing LCG format Asylum Packs.

Pros: Good resourcing system, interesting decisions during the play. Not a CCG

Cons: Games seem to be over too quickly. Forced "Highlander" format feels a bit weird. Not that interested in buying two more core sets. Will likely buy singles of all of the APs though.

Insanity has never been so much fun. While the gameplay of Call of Cthulhu isn't quite as riveting to me as the Netrunner LCG, the theme alone makes deckbuilding and playing this game a good time.

Be aware that the Core set only includes one of each card. It's still a great way to try out the game, but tough for more complex deckbuilding until you add on to your collection.

A game with a steep learning curve which is slightly off-putting, but it forces you to think about all your moves - which is a good thing - even though all your best laid plans may end in ruination if your opponent has the right set of cards to thwart you. Tense, unpredictable and fun.

Hopeless core set, but great game if you invest in big enough card pool. Best LCG mechanicwise IMO.

I really love the theme of this game and prefer the goal of winning stories opposed to killing your opponent which is what most CCG's rely on.  I am also glad they changed the game to a noncollectable format.

I initially believed that this game was excellent, but after some time spent with the core set, I found that it felt really unbalanced. There came to be a "snowball effect" where, when one player had succeeded in bringing out a myriad of creatures, it was difficult for the other player to make any sort of a comeback. All in all, this hit the table two to three times before it was put away. Perhaps the expansions helped with these issues.

Interesting.  My first exposure to a so-called "living card game".  Like a CCG with only one rarity.  Great implementation, very themey.

Caja bastante tocada, aunque no rota, desgastada. Sin inserto interior.

this was a fun little card game. though i never actually played the real game, we made our own game with the cards after reading the rules and finding the game to be shit.

Oh also full of FFG LCG signature unnecessary  tokens and resin figures and crap to bloat the price of an otherwise mostly empty box.

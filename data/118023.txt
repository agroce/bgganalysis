Don't know why this guy's games make the leap to dice versions so smoothly.  Is it because the originals are so abstract to begin with...or is it that he's just a great dice game designer?

Light, fun, small.  Wish the box wasn't cube-shaped, but oh well.  Kudos for the reverse side of the board.  Probably start playing it with my 8-year-old daughter.

As the mediocre game it is, Keltis succeeds in one thing only: growing boring soon and annoying the players quickly, all of which made it the perfect candidate for the Spiel des Jahres award (that it did win indeed).

Anyhow, the card and dice variants are way better than the original game, the dice filler still being the best of them all thanks to its simplicity and quick gameplay. (March 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - The advanced board offers a much more challenging and entertaining game, as it requires a better strategy, planning and a heavier share of luck at rolling the dice: all of this strengthens my impression that this dice filler is way better than any other version of Keltis. My rating remains the same though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just love its simplicity.   Certainly the best of the quicky keltis spinoffs I think, and while a lot of it is luck based, there are a fair number of decisions that can be made throughout the course of a game.

Another Keltis spin off from the master.  Great little dice game which sees players climbing a ladder for points.  Sits well among the other Keltis games, as well as Knizia's other die rollers.  The flip side alternate "tough" board is a nice touch too.

I am not a huge fan of dice games; there are exceptions however, and in general what I dislike is when a long game of strategy is decided by a few dice rolls.
I like zombie dice, because it's neither a game of strategy nor a long game, but zombie dice is barely a game, and gets old quickly unless you are drunk, tired or both.
I also like Ra the dice game because it gives you the feeling that you take meaningful decisions, while remaining short, and the veneer theme kinds of works.
Keltis with dice manages to capture the risk taking of Ra with the speedier game play of Zombie dice, with a pinch of decision thrown in the mix.  The theme is only in the graphics. And the dice are really nice too.
I find myself playing this two or three times in a row, which is a good sign.

A játékos dob az 5 kockával, majd dobhat még egyszer. Dobhat újra akár mind az öttel, de ki is választhatja, hogy melyik kockákat tartja meg, amikkel nem dob újra. A második dobás után értékeljük a kockákat. Ha két vagy több kocka mutat követ, akkor a játékos kap egy kívánságkövet. A Keltis kövek dobásánál annyit mozog az adott sorban, ahány szimbólumot mutatnak a dobott kockák. Ha több fajtát is dobott, a dobó dönti el, hogy melyik sorban akar mozogni. Figyelni kell arra, hogy az 5 színből csak négy sorban indulhatunk el, egy sor mindenképpen kimarad. De a dobás után dönthetünk úgy is, hogy passzolunk, így nem kell elindulnunk olyan sorban, amellyel esetleg csak mínusz pontokat kapnánk.
A táblán itt is vannak előre nyomtatott jelölők, így vannak lóherék, koboldok és kövek is, amiket
ugyanúgy lehet gyűjteni.

The connection to Keltis is clearly visible and the Würfelspiel is a successful adaptation of the boardgame to dice. Another clever implementation of the Keltis premise of progressing in selected tracks, this time as a 15 minute filler game. It's not so much taking decisions about pushing your luck as most of the time you have to hope for lucky rolls anyway but a few tactical decisions where to progress remain to make playing this worthwile. My only gripe is the advantage of the starting player.

My 1499th rated game!

Knizia truly has the magic touch and can do no wrong in this Keltis series. Every game in the series has truly earned its place, despite having the blandest and most obviously pasted on theme. Say what you will about the rehashed nature of this brand, the Keltis dice game is quick, easy to learn and a lot of fun. I will always play on the side with the x'ed out spaces, which provides for more interesting decisions.

Easily -2 rating points due to the tiny board on which the player tokens cover up the important information. One person designed the board, a completely different person designed the tokens, but even after they didn't go well together they all decided to publish the shit result, anyway, go figure.

We learned to put this on a lazy susan to have any chance of reading the board. Considering scanning the board and printing it larger, even A4/LTR would be an improvement.

I had this game sent to me by accident!

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game but it's been fairly hit and miss with others I've played with.  I've seen a few players get frustrated because they really want to go for certain symbols which don't come up, and playing on the advanced side of the board can be frustrating if someone gets stuck on one of the tracks.  I like the icon abilities and trying to set up chaining combos.  Since the game ends once the condition is met, the starting players have a bit of an advantage, but that can be fixed by simply allowing an equal number of turns at the end.  I've never played any of the others in the Keltis series, so I can't offer any comparison there.

A quick, simplified dice version of Keltis that works better than it has any right to. The included board is two-sided enabling a bit of variety. For the low price and time commitment, this is definitely worthwhile, even if it's probably the least impressive game in the Keltis line.

Only 1 re-roll makes this even more luck driven than the usual "Yahtzee" spinoffs. If that isn't enough, the advanced side removes even the last bit of control.

RATING: 4
The components are basic, but good enough, and the art is good too. Just the box size is a bit annoying for storing purposes.

The basic version is booooooring. I don't understand why it has been included, because the "advanced" one is quite basic as far as rules complexity are concerned.

The advanced gameplay is much more interesting, but it's still quite limited as a game. Most of the choices are obvious, especially once you have committed to certain routes. It's just a matter of rolling dice a getting results. Absolutely zero interaction, something quite odd in a race game.

If found it to be a quite poor design for a 2012 game. [thing=67609]Way of the Dragon[/thing] is not what I would call a great game, but it is very similar and has interaction, which creates much more tension.

A filler dice game. It just feels a little bit monotonous. Gladly it is rather short! I miss the mechanic from the basic game where you try to make moves that aren't advantageous for other players. I always felt that was something that made "Lost Cities" and "Keltis" special. So my rating is a little bit lower.

Well done dice filler that retains the feel of the board game quite well. The wishing stones sometimes feel a bit too easy to get. You do have to be careful as the endgame can sneak up on you. Stupid shape for a box though.

Cheira a Keltis e é defacto um parente bem próximo, embora muito mais simples, muito mais rápido e muito mais “transportável”. O facto de ter desafios bem diverentes de um e outro lado do tabuleiro é uma grande vantagem, assim como a beleza e a qualidade dos componentes. Dentro da linha de familiarizações, é das mais bem conseguidas que já vi…

As I have come to expect from Knizia, this game doesn't look like it should work but it does.  It looks like pure luck but it is not.

It is a little high on luck, but probably not for the reasons you think at first (and much less than you think at first).

Keltis in artwork & scoring, but basically a dice rolling progression game. A bit of push your luck (especially on the 'difficult' side of the board), a bit of getting clever combinations. A big hit for us.

Each logged play is actually [i]both[/i] sides of the board.

We use a small house rule: the rules translation I have says you [b]may[/b] move or add a piece. We play that you [b]must[/b] add/move if you can. This affects the late game where softies can avoid adding a piece to score negative points, whereas real men should have planned for that situation.

As far as dice fillers goes, this game fell in the mediocre category where it kept everyone entertained for 20 minutes, but I am not sure anyone would actively seek out the game. I suppose that is the concept of a dice filler. I am a huge fan of Knizia, however, so there is a small part of me that is biased toward his designs. This game is not bad by any means, but it does not really stand out in a field of crowded dice games. Especially if you already own other Keltis type games, this is probably not very high on the list of must-haves since one can suffer from theme fatigue (see "Zombie-themed" games).

Now that i finally have all the incarnation of Keltis (except the MiniSpiel promotional game) i feel i lived a complete life :)

The game itself is probably the lightest of all the games and it lacks the feel of sacrifice you have to make when placing an 8 after a 1 and a 2. Here you just throw dice.
But there's still some interesting decision to make: how to approach and "jump" over forbidden squares and how much to press on gems collection.
I strongly urge to play the version with forbidden squares.

Not bad to be played with children!

Forget about the pasted on theme, this is the best 2-player dice game in my collection. It's light, quick and fun. I always play on the side with the x'ed out spaces (the "advanced" version) as it is more tactical. The balance between luck and thinking is just perfect for my taste. If you like other dice games by Knizia, such as Pickomino or Sushi Bar, this one should fit your taste!

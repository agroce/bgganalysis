RATING: N/A
Wonderful components -- nice big ships, good-looking board, nice little pirate guys and cannons to move around on the ships.  Gameplay was quick and dirty and didn't live up to the components.  It cries out for more complex cannon and boarding rules.

RATING: 6.4
Not really as involved as the other games from the Game Master series, but at least it is playable in under an hour.  Also probably has the best components of the series, even though it is more than slightly annoying that the large ships, when assembled, don't sit flush in the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Easy to play game.  Game play was OK, nothing special.  Very 'dicey', game length is too short, and allows for only two players.  The components are of good quality, although the rulebook could have been better organized and written.

RATING: 5.5
A dice-heavy game meant to be played by kids. Very enjoyable if you are not concerned about accuracy and realism, or how the design makes scoring a hit more difficult the more damage you've inflicted (which can be explained, but makes for a longer game).

If you have fond memories of it from when you were a kid, you'll like it---and treasure it---more .

I loved it the first three times, then the charm wore off.  It is visually stunning, but the game play is kind of light and somewhat dry.  It's a good starter miniature war game though.  (it's kind of like warhammer meets gothic lite).

One corner of the box lid has a pretty serious split that continues for about inch along the edge.  Box also has very obvious shelf wear. There are only four damaged "blades" on light gray pirates. Other than that, this baby's complete and in great shape.

Not the best game ever designed but fun and quick to play. The components are fiddly and breakable so it is rare to find a complete  game without a broken ship mast or a couple of missing pirates. I am always looking for spare parts for my set. I'm still glad to have a playable copy.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game considering its age. I love the ship combat, which still feels original even today, and I wish more games used a similar "broadsides" mechanic. The board and ships look great, and the whole game creates a wonderful atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the game's negatives outweigh the positives. First, it is extremely fiddly; it is very tricky to set the pieces up and and is nearly impossible to avoid knocking down the minis as you play. Secondly, your ship and crew can begin to become so crippled halfway through the game that you really don't have many options on your turn. In some cases, even boarding seems impossible. 

What this game basically boils down to is: random, dice-heavy combat, in which the luckiest roller wins. This may not be a bad thing for some people, but it just wasn't a game for us.

This is a great game from back in the day and its main positive attribute is the programmed movement of ships. Different firing angles and number of cannon involved based on relative heading of the ships is a great mechanic for this type of "dice chucking" game. Play can get a little bogged down when the ships collide and one is boarded. A charming two player gem from the past. Play it if you get the chance.

B&B is another game I've had since I was a kid.  It received a lot of table time then, due to the fact there are massive pirate ships to interact with.  Even back then, I argued there was to much luck involved.  Doesn't hit the table now.  The theme is great though...  Encourages sayings as "Put some fire in your bellies!"...

RATING: 4
A somewhat typical sort of game, for the time and publisher.  A card-based simultaneous-orders movement system for chase and engagement, with cannon fire having a large element of luck, followed by the almost inevitable boarding of one ship by the other's crew.  This is where the game components get shaky, and I mean that literally.  The little bastards simply do not want to stay vertical, much less in their assigned spaces on the decks - they have the sealegs of marbles in a bathtub. (And talk about your "loose cannon"...)  A fiddly and (again) largely luck-based melee ensues, with dice-based attrition ending with one side or the other wiped out.

RATING: 6
Perhaps my least favorite to play of the gamemaster series, but my favorite to look at.  The boarding party combat isn't crucial to the game, and there are many games where it doesn't occur.  Not much strategy here.  But it does look really cool.

RATING: 4
As a ship game it is too simple in ways that it doesn't need to be.  Like rakes doing less damage rather than more.  It would also benefit from ramming rules; besides being cool it would balance the broadside the turn before the other guy gets.  And for as cool as the components look, they aren't very functional.  The decks are all curved so dudes all slide to the main mast.  The preprogrammed movement is excellent though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I sense that this game is unfairly trashed. I rather like it for what it is: a simple tactical naval battle. You program in three movements and fire volleys in a fast-paced sailing game. the Boarding rules are a dice-fest, granted, but I'd rather play that than dozens of tedious old titles...

The first phase where you're moving ships and trying to position yourself is fun. The second part though where you get to move the ships together and duke it out is fantastic! Not that deep of a game and completely different from the rest of the GameMaster Series, but one that will never leave my collection and even with Rum & Bones entering my collection there's room for this one as well.

Yay! Okay - so I paid a pretty penny for this, but for some stupid reason I want to complete my Gamemaster collection. So here it is - one of the most overproduced games ever. But I don't care. I can make pirate noises the whole time.  Game-play isn't awful, fortunately.  Even if it is a completely different experience than the other GameMaster series games, it's still a good time and a valid part of the series.  You get a good feel as a pirate - super themey and all that.  As long as you know that is the only thing you're getting (theme, not much strategy) than it's quite fun. Otherwise, it's heavily luck dependent with some tactical goodness thrown in.

675/ This game is labeled "A Game of High Adventure". I think that's true even if you haven't started to assemble the two ships yet! The history of the Spanish Main during the 17th Century is more hair raising and contains more dramatic spectacle than you can imagine! I'm sure everyone has seen at least one pirate movie,but with this game, you will not have to play these sagas in the theater of your mind; you'll experience the thrills directly in your living room! The best part is that no matter who wins the first clash, no two battles should be alike.

The Milton Bradley Gamemaster series game that has a bad reputation... which, in my opinion, is not justified.

The game plays quite well and is usually tense to the very end.  And the beautiful tall ship models don't hurt the aesthetics either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Brother had this and I've played many times.  Yes the setup is a pain (especially when the big mast's top part fell off scattering men and cannons!) but it is a good light game.  Some games lasted too long because with 3 cards we'd both look for "perfect shots" (ie a broadside to a backside) that just didn't come.  The game was very dissapointing when a ship would win without boarding at all -BUT normally we'd rush to board and then have a lovely dicefest.  Plain simple fun where the turn of the die decides your fate.  Oh yeah, and great bits, if it's ever reprinted I'll get a copy.

5.8, what a crime this has such a low rating. I bought this way back when it first came out and I loved it. I thought the movement system was unique for the day. I really enjoy trying to guess where my opponent will steer his ship, trying to get the best position. Sure it's maybe not the most indepth game around but I find it extremely fun. Also when the game is set up it looks extremely cool with all those cannons sticking out of the side. Heavy on the "toy" factor but that's usually a plus for me. Sure beats battleship any day of the week.

I believe this was the first in the Gamemaster series, which I have a huge nostalgic fondness for.  This one had amazing components with the two big plastic ships with masts and men on the decks.  There was nothing like it, once upon.  The gameplay is pretty simple with cards programming your movement, but I give it higher marks because it was great fun back in the day.  Now it sits in my collection unplayed for years, but I don't plan on ever trading or selling it.

This game also gets a 5 only after re-writing the combat rules and creating rules for a captain, first mate, and helmsman. Still, a great game for small windows of time that is easy to teach and plays quickly, even if that upper main mast falls off and destroys your crew sometimes...LOL. I must add that this was the second boardgame I ever bought with my own money way back when....

I like the preprogrammed movement mechanic.  Sailing around and trying to get shots on the other ship is the best part of the game.  Once the ships grapple together and start hand to hand fighting, the fight seem predestined.  Fighting is so even that usually who ever has more men left wins.  The hand to hand fighting could use something more.

This game has wonderful presentation and is impressive to see in person. The meat of the game is done with the navigation of the miniatures and subsequent cannon fire rounds.

A classic from the MB Gamemaster series I had when I was a kid. It's a nice and fairly quick game with really nice components, though the pieces don't stay in place well. 

Had an awesome epic game where all of the sailors died and came down to one die roll captain vs. captain and they both died of injuries. It was hilarious. 

Pulling out and dusting this one off brought back some fun and memories and it earned a place back on the shelf.
It's a unique game and I'm glad it didn't get sold at a garage sale or something.

I've got to give this game a pretty high rating based on presentation alone...  Nice ships, decent board and playing cards, pirate men and cannons, this game really looks the part.

The "Broadsides" portion of the game is the better of the two.  Trying to out-move your opponent and blasting away at them with your cannons is great fun and really makes this game worthwhile!!

On the other hand, the "Boarding Parties" part of the game (which happens when the two ships collide with one another) is not as exciting...  Maybe could've used a bit more to it at that point.

Overall, a decent game that I've owned since it first came out and am glad that I've kept.  The only game in the "GameMaster" series that isn't like Risk...

The first half of the game (broadsides) is pretty good, sail around trying to out guess & out-manuever your opponent then cannon-ball the heck out of them.  Aim for their captain or sails to get the edge.  The second half of them game (boarding parties), if it comes to it, is purely a dice-fest where you can usually see who's going to win.  Not bad for it's time, but now there are much better games.

A very simplistic game wrapped up in a lot of chrome.  I used to play this a bit during high school, and even then I thought that the game could have been more interesting if the rules were changed around a bit.

One of MB's original gamemaster series. This one was a serious disapointment to me compared to the others. Pretty decent components but I nver got into the gameplay. I gave my kids the two ships and men to play with so alas the game is no more.

Back in 1984/85, after opening up the box and not being terribly impressed, I exchanged it for Axis & Allies. Now I wonder about the game play. Is it any good? I suppose not nearly as good as A&A, which is the only of the two still in print.

RATING: 5
Game is absolutely beautiful, miniature cannons, fully fledged out ships with masts, etc., then again I'm a bits whore.  Love those small beautifully made components.  Artwork is gorgeous, but rules are overly simple.  With some variant rules added to it, it's a lot of fun.  Rating goes up then.  I have 2 sets of this game so that I could make it a spanish fleet against a pirate fleet.  Looks pretty cool, and game play is much different then.

I have one copy of the game that has the following defects (it is almost 30 years old and I owned it as a kid):

The box is thrashed.  It holds the game parts but was crushed at some point in the 80's.  It has multiple tears. Yuk.

Game Board - the surface is in great shape, the corners have slight warp, the bottom is dirty.

Ships - Great shape.  The white ship has a small scuff on the top.

Cards - Great shape

Crews - all pieces are here but 5 white pirates do not have bases.  7 black pirates do not have bases and one is missing his sword.

The game is playable, some pirates just need to lay down.  With all this in mind, make an offer if you are interested in a trade.

Finally got this one off of ebay.  I've been wanting it ever since I was a kid and had bought some of the other games in the series (this is the last one I needed).  The game is ok, I wanted it more to complete the series than for the game itself.  But my kids will love it.

RATING: 6.01
I'm not sure why this game is a "GameMaster" game since the strategy isn't nearly as developed as Axis and Allies or Conquest of the Empire. What it loses in complexity it makes up in being a short-played game--very nice in hectic lifestyles. As was true for all GameMaster games the production value and collectability is off-the-chart, and a welcome additon to my collection. Has received a reincarnation in my life as my young son really loves the subject of Pirates, and this game is fun for both of us to play. Own a first-edition in great condition (no broken pieces) with minor box shelf wear.

Not worthy of the MB GameMaster series name.  Although the use of cards to navigate is fine, the shooting is very random, and the 'boarding parties' part is worse.  I think it would need to be tinkered with extensively in order to work.  I started on doing that, but then gave in and sold it for $ on eBay.

RATING: 7
I played this a lot growing up with my brother and brother in law.  The masts never stay on right and the crewmen have a tendency to slip on the deck.  That being said, the nostalgia of playing it again made it worthwhile.  I think the overall rating is low for this.  It's a fun game and worth the time.

Nice ship models and neat little cannons.  The game itself is not much for strategy or real decison making however. It either floats or sinks based on your enjoyment of the miniatures rather than the game itself.

Love the theme, but there is something missing in the game. It has been a while since I played it but I recall liking the Broadside portion of the game better than the Boarding Party part. Still, it’s a  very pretty game to look it when set-up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another Classic game for me. The card maneuvering aspect of this game is the biggest draw for me. Combat is reduced to simple die rolling to see where you hit or miss. This part can be a bit anti climatic, but pulverizing an enemy ship when you use superior movement is quite satisfying.

Broadsides portion = 5, Boarding Parties portion = 3.  Once the ships were strung together it was &quot;whomever rolls the best dice wins!&quot;  Totally strategy-free gaming once the ships came together.  Before that, as they fired at each other, much better and at least a little thinking.  Fun to play once a year just to get a kick out of setting up the boats.

Fun 2 player game, but the boarding is not as fun as trying to out guess the other ship's manovering... we don't board, just keep the cannons going.

Ah, those awesome pirate ships. Lots of little pieces that go flying everywhere when the cat jumps on the table. HOWEVER, the sailing play is quite fun (even more fun than the boarding) and all those pieces are just incredible (albiet a bit fragile) And those high ebay prices are a bit of a turn off - As Ferris Bueller once said "if you have the means, I highly recommend it."

This game is excellent, beautiful, and creative UNTIL the ships collide...then it becomes a silly battle of stupid, dice-rolling pawns not worth the time to set up the ships and the board.  It commands a very high price on eBay though due to its quality production, limited numbers, and being the first-issue in the MB Gamemaster series.

Ok so the combat leaves something to be desired and the pirates are forever falling over and the masts frequently drop off the ships. Still this is one of my favorite games from my childhood and have recently introduced it to my kids who also love it. For their time the Milton Bradley Gamemaster series games had the best pieces bar none. This game was no exception, large scale sailing ships complete with miniature canons, come on!

I really want to like this game but the positioning mechanic of the ships basically ends once both come within firing range....which is what both players want to do anyway---make cannon-fodder of your foe! It needs a fix, maybe a Yahtzee mechanic to mimic accuracy- eg. no dice re-roll at 3 spaces away; 3 re-rolls at 1 space away? Granted, it's fun to play with the pieces but I think there's more toy than game...there I said it.

Played this twice, lost both times. Once as a kid, and lost because the owner knew the tiny bit of strategy that helps in this game. Once as an adult...and lost because of poor dice rolls. 
All the bits sure are fun and this game IS pretty cool during the 'maneuvering ship' phase (trying to out-guess your opponent), but the Boarding parties part...well it's mostly a strategy-less dicefest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's silly, but it is undoubtedly evocotive.  Fun movement system, that has been improved over time with Dragon Delta, Wings of War, and Wreckage.  The broadsides cannon action is fun, but eventually the game is going to wind down to a halt as you become crippled and can't move.  Lots of dice, with poor percentages make hitting people really lucky.  This can get irritating quickly.  Still, worth pulling out once a year just to look at all the pretty components.

As a big fan of other games in the MB GameMaster series (Samurai, Fortress America, etc.), I was extremely excited about the release of this game. The nearest Toys'R'Us is 50 miles away, and I drove down after work to buy a copy on the first day they had it in stock (I'd been calling daily).

When I got it home, I discovered that the physical design was so poorly thought out that the ships wouldn't fit back in the box after assembly, and the figures were forever slipping down the slanted decks during play.

I could have lived with the shortcomings in the physical design if the game play was good, but I found it shallow and boring. Perhaps my most disappointing game purchase ever.

Good theme play.  Easy to play game.  Game play is OK, nothing special.  Very 'dicey' combat system, which seems to remove any strategy.  The components are of good quality - plastic playing pieces.  The rulebook could have been better organized and written.  Game length is very short at about 20 minutes.

 Fine bits. I had so much fun playing this with my son when he was 8. I thought I'd give it an 8. Talking like pirates for hours. Arrrgh! Eye me matie, Full canvas make haste, Eye me matie, Arrrgh, LOL constanly. Thought his mother was going to go crazy! My son loved it. Those little guys slid all over the deck at the slightest bump. One would fall off the deck, Eye, too much rum me matie, Arrrgh, Eye! tis the rum, Arrgh. I can start to see why his mother was going crazy. At the time I used double sticky sided tape. But now I'd probably put a thin shmear of clear silicone, they wouldn't slide any more. Then I got him playing Axis and Allies, he loved that too. But alas, my son loves his beer now. Arrrgh! Oh! to have just one more hour of those times, priceless. A game like this becomes a family heirloom. I do need one cannon however. Arrrgh! That's so fun!

Beautiful to look at, but setting it up takes much too long considering the amount of time spent playing the game.  It's also possible to end the game without ever getting to the boarding-the-enemy-ship phase, the preparation for which is the sole reason for the long setup.

Just received it from Ebay : absolute gorgeous. absolute fun too. Took me a long time to get in the game simply simply because I though it was childish ; ITS NOT!!! 
The game really recapture the clash of sailing ship across the ocean and the experience of crew boarding and canon warfare in silk coats.
Don't hesitate to drink while playing!!!

PS : finding a good copy is hard and expansive but worth the investment. Mine will stay on my shelves until I die. I will play with my children and grand children for sure.

I wish they would reprint this game, with different colors maybe and units and ships and maps. WOuld be fun.

RATING: 7
Broadsides and Boarding Parties was the first title in Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series of games. It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea. There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.

The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another. In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play. Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain. Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.

This was the First game out in a good series of games brought out from Milton Bradley. After this came Axis & Allies, Conquest of the Empire, Shogun and Fortress America.I still have them all. The only problem with this game was the figures sliding around the ship. I just put some clear silicone glue on the bottom of them. When it dried they were rubbery on the bottom and it kept them in place.

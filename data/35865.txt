What an excellent children game Auf die Schätze, fertig los! is! Both kids and grown-ups can enjoy its many challenges, since they all are quite varying and definitely easy: moreover, Auf die Schätze casts a very light and warm atmosphere around the table, which is what makes it the gem of a game it is.

A must-have for every family with children of age.

This is a nice little children's game. The components are top-notch.  The timer has a nice mechanism to balance things between adults, older and younger kids.

There's no real reason for adults to play it...but its worthwhile for a light parent/child game, particularly with the very young.

Thrifted.  Rated for kids.  Similar game as Jungle Treasure but for a younger set of kids.  Challenges include building structures from blocks, rearranging wooden animals, rolling a specific icon on a die, matching treasures, grabbing a particular animal before your opponent grabs it, and pantomiming an animal.  Nice wooden components and large cards.  Decent speed/push your luck game for around 4-5 year olds.  When I play with my kids, they get to play 3 rounds while I play 2 -- then we tally up our points.

I rate children's games according to how excited I am to play them with the appropriate aged child.

I looked at this game with trepidation for young children because it is a timed-turn game mainly involving solving puzzles.  As a child I myself would get very flustered when anything was timed (even though I might be good at it)--all I could concentrate on was the clock.  Very anxiety provoking.  Early on I developed a feeling of defeat every time I saw a timer.  (This progressed into school where un-timed tests I aced, while timed tests which most were, made me physically ill.  Interestingly, math was my favorite subject, yet it created the most anxiety.)

So I have mixed emotions about this game.  This might be a very good way to early on introduce timed exercises so children become familiar and at ease with the pressure and confident with their success. (I also can't help thinking that some of the adults I pay with who suffer from brain freeze, might have benefited from more timed games during their childhood.) On the other hand, games should be fun and if a child shows stress under the timer I will not push the game on them.  

HABA makes quality games at a high price.  I am glad I have this well-done game with colorful and sturdy components, and game play I don't have in other children's games.  However, there are other HABA games I like better.

This one is very similar to Jungle Treasure, AKA Dschungelschatz; I like this one, Treasure, Ready, Go! better.

A slightly more kindergarden-friendly version of Dschungelschatz (by the same designer). It's got a bigger box & nicer components... and more rules variations.

Fantastic game for kids! Great wooden components and the artwork is very child friendly and fun! The gameplay has fared well with my 4 year old and has even won over my 7 year old! Haba is starting to be my new favorite children's board game company!

Christmas 2012. Much to learn for a young child's game.

RATING: 7
Rating based on playing with children.

This game is basically a older sibling to Jungle Treasure, involving performing different actions while under time pressure.  One critical difference is that you can see the timer.  The tasks are pretty similar, though unfortunately some are much easier than others (like imitating the animals).  The pieces are really nice, big blocks and really chunky wooden animals (I think the alligator is the same as the one in Tier auf Tier).  I still see this game as a good preparation for more frantic Fraga games later on such as Time Is Money and Squad Seven.  Gotta get the little guys indoctrinated ASAP!

I have a mixed feeling about this one. When they are too youg, the numerous different actions can be overwhelming, while the simplicity of thos actions makes the game a bit too easy once they get a hold of the variety. On the other hand, they can still have fun against players of THEIR AGE.

Great fun, but with hand-eye coordination being better for grown-ups, they're more likely to win. Fun game for grown-ups too though.

In this game you flip cards that give you activities to try to complete. You complete as many actions as you can in a given amount of time. You call stop to score points for the activities you have completed. If the timer runs out while you are still doing an activity, you collect no points that turn for any completed action. Each player gets 3 turns, person with most points wins.

Kids game.

I think this one is all about how into this the kids are as you play. For me, my kids love the game and get super into it. It's a fun game of timed mini games that puts the pressure on. Big hit with my children. This is the most requested game from my kids.

Ok, I was going to rate it a 4, but I have been rating children's games according to my daughter's desire to play, and she really loves this one (she's almost 4).

I have since moved this down from my original 7 down to 5, because it doesnt seem to have a lot of replay value.

My 2.5 year old loves this game. We play without timer and draw 1 card at a time. I can see how this game can be still played as she grows older.

An absolute pleasure to play! I will always play this game when asked. It really is silly, intense, fun for all ages. The variety of things with which you have to do and yet not push your luck to far is simply wonderful! One of Haba's essential games to own and one that luckily seems to be remaining in print. The components are awesome. Super fun game.

Speed/push-your-luck game with a variety of different tasks.  Zany fun.  Seems playable by ages  4 and up but will require handicapping.  (Best strategy is probably two different sand timers).

If you have easygoing children, the timer and points should work.  If not, skip them and enjoy the fun activities.

Play it with my children. Good for some laughs. We play that the adults discard all their cards when the timer runs out on you. The children only discard their last card.
